CDCP1 has also been designated as CD318 (cluster of differentiation 318) and Trask (Transmembrane and associated with src kinases). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.  Function  CDCP1/Trask is not important for the development of the mouse. Adult mice lacking CDCP1 do not exhibit gross morphologic, reproductive or behavioral abnormalities compared with wild-type mice, and histologic examination of multiple organ systems has shown no significant pathology and no observed histologic differences. CDCP1 is a ligand for CD6, a receptor molecule expressed on certain T-cells and may play a role in their migration and chemotaxis. As such CDCP1 may contribute to autoimmune diseases such as encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory arthritis. CDCP1 is a 140 kD transmembrane glycoprotein with a large extracellular domain (ECD) containing two CUB domains, and a smaller intracellular domain (ICD). CDCP1 is cleaved by serine proteases at the extracellular domain next to Arg368 to generate a truncated molecule of 80 kDa size. Different cell lines express different amounts of p140 and p80, depending on the activity of endogenous serine proteases. In vivo, CDCP1 is not cleaved during normal physiological circumstances, but its cleavage can be induced during tumorigenesis or tissue injury. The intracellular domain of CDCP1 contains five tyrosine residues - Y707, Y734, Y743, Y762 and Y806. Phosphorylation of CDCP1 is exclusively mediated by Src kinases and depends on the adherence state of the cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 in cultured cells occurs when cells are induced to detach by trypsin or EDTA, or seen spontaneously during mitotic detachment. The loss of anchorage or cellular detachment is associated with the phosphorylation of CDCP1 as well as the concomitant dephosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, consistent with the dismantling of focal adhesions. Contrary, during cellular attachment CDCP1 is dephosphorylated, allowing the phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins. The anti-adhesion and anti-migratory functions of CDCP1 are mediated through negative regulation on integrin receptors.  Clinical significance  The phosphorylation of CDCP1 is seen in many cancers, including some pre-invasive cancers as well as in invasive tumors and in tumor metastases.

Missense mutations cause a genetic form of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2, also called Gordon syndrome. WNK4 is a member of a serine/threonine kinase family that comprises of four members. The family is so named because unlike other serine/threonine kinases, WNKs are characterized by the lack of the lysine in the subdomain II of the catalytic domain. Instead, a lysine in the Œ≤2 strand of subdomain I of the catalytic domain is responsible for the kinase activity. The WNK4 gene is located on chromosome 17q21-q22. It produces a 1,243-amino acid protein encoded by a 3,732-nucleotide open reading frame within a 4 kb cDNA transcript. WNK4 protein is highly expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and the cortical collecting duct (CDD) of the kidney. WNK4 is also present in the brain, lungs, liver, heart, and colon of various mammalian species. Gene mutations in WNK4 has been found in patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), also known as familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt) or Gordon syndrome. PHAII is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease characterized by hyperkalemia, hypertension, and metabolic acidosis. WNK4 plays a critical role in the regulation of various transporters and channels in the kidney. PHAII-causing mutations in WNK4 result in the dysregulation of renal sodium and potassium transporters and channels, leading to defects in sodium and potassium retention by the kidney, and in turn, elevated blood pressure and potassium level (hyperkalemia).  Structure  The tertiary structure of WNK4 has not been elucidated to date. Nevertheless, several individual domain structures of the protein are identified. These include a kinase domain near the amino terminus followed by an autoinhibitory domain, an acidic motif, two coiled-coil domains, and a calmodulin-binding domain in the C-terminal segment (Fig. 1). The structures for the kinase and autoinhibitory domains of WNK1 have been revealed. The high level of structural similarity between WNK4 and WNK1 allows us to deduce key structural details of WNK4 based on the insights gained from the corresponding regions within WNK1. The kinase domain of WNK4 has an 83% sequence identity with that of WNK1. The overall fold of the kinase domain of WNK1 resembles those of other protein kinases that have a typical dual-domain architecture. The C-terminal domain of WNK4 bears a high degree of similarity to other kinases within the family. On the other hand, the N-terminal domain is unique in having a six-stranded instead of a five-stranded Œ≤ sheet to form a complete Œ≤ barrel. Fig. 1. Domain structure of WNK4 and the positions of the initially identified PHAII-causing mutations. The amino-acid (aa) positions of the domains are provided in parentheses. Some important PHAII mutations are localized in the acidic motif and calmodulin-binding domain, respectively. A chloride ion binding site has been identified in the region 320DLG323 of the kinase domain in WNK4. The binding of chloride Cl‚àí in this region inhibits the activation of WNK4. The autoinhibitory domain is a homolog of the RFXV-binding PASK/FRAY homology 2 (PF2) domain. Structural studies have revealed that the autoinhibitory domain consists of three Œ≤-strands and two Œ±-helices. Notably, the RFXV‚Äêbinding groove is formed by the Œ≤3-Œ±A interface of WNK proteins where RFXV peptide ligand interacts directly with residues Phe524, Asp531, and Glu539 of WNK1. The interaction between the RFXV motif and the autoinhibitory domain makes it possible for the C-terminal region of WNK4 to be in close proximity of the kinases domain and subsequently regulate its activity.  Function  Fig. 2. The WNK4-SPAK/OSR1-NCC phosphorylation cascade. WNK4 phosphorylates and activates SPAK/OSR1, which in turn phosphorylate and activates NCC. In this manner, WNK4 regulates sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and downstream potassium secretion through its positive effects on NCC. As a typical kinase, WNK4 accomplishes the phosphorylation of its substrate proteins by adding a phosphate moiety in an ATP-dependent manner. This structural modification usually results in functional alterations of downstream substrates. Some currently known substrates of WNK4 includes kinases STE20-serine-proline alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress response 1 kinase (OSR1), which in turn can phosphorylate and activate the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) (Fig. 2). Similarly, WNK4 activates NKCC1 and deactivate KCC2 through a SPAK-dependent mechanism. The kinase activity of WNK4 has been demonstrated in vitro using the WNK4 kinase domain purified from E. coli. This phosphorylation cascade is critical in regulating sodium and potassium homeostasis dysregulation which is tied to the pathogenesis of PHAII. In addition to NCC, WNK4 also regulates multiple ions channels and cotransporters in the kidney through various mechanisms. These include epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK), transient receptor potential vanilloid member 4 and 5 (TRPV4/5, calcium channels), Na-K-2Cl cotransporter 1 and 2 (NKCC1/2), K+-Cl‚àí cotransporter type 2 (KCC2), and other channels/transporters. WNK4 inhibits the functions of ENaC, ROMK, and TRPV4 by reducing the total and cell surface expression of these channels. WNK4 enhances TRPV5 by increasing its forward trafficking to the plasma membrane in a kinase-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of WNK4 on ROMK is reversed by serum and glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1) or by a corresponding phosphomimetic S1169D mutation on WNK4. The N-terminal segment of WNK4 containing the kinase domain and acidic motif is required for the WNK4-mediated inhibition of ROMK. The second coiled-coil domain of WNK4 mediates the downregulation of TRPV4. WNK4 and calcium-binding protein 39 (Cab39) act together to activate transporters NKCC1 and NKCC2.  Role in pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2  = Dysregulation of WNK4 kinase activity = In 2001, four missense mutations in the WNK4 gene were identified in patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHAII) (Fig. 1). Three of these mutations (E562K, D564A, and Q565E) are charge-changing substitutions in the acidic motif of WNK4, which are conserved among all members of the WNK family in human and rodent species. The fourth substitution (R1185C) is located in the calmodulin-binding domain near the second coiled-coil domain. Few other PHAII mutations in WNK4 have also been reported. Examples of these mutations include E560G, P561L, and D564H, all of which are located close to or in the acidic motif; and K1169E which is located between the coiled-coil 2 and the calmodulin-binding domain. Fig. 3. Proposed mechanisms by which PHAII-causing mutations in WNK4, KLHL3, and Cullin 3 lead to increased kinase activity of WNK4. Left panel, under physiological condition, angiotensin II elicits an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ ions interact with the acidic motif of WNK4 and increase the kinase activity. Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) also binds to the C-terminal CaM-binding domain and relieves the inhibition of the kinase activity of WNK4. WNK4 protein is degraded by the KLHL3-Cullin 3 ubiquitin E3 ligase. Right panel, under PHAII condition, PHAII mutations in the acidic motif mimic the Ca2+ binding state and lead to an increase in kinase activity. The R1185C mutation relieves the inhibitory effect of the C-terminal domain on the kinase activity of WNK4. Mutations in KLHL3 or Cullin 3 impair the degradation of WNK4 protein, leading to an increase in total kinase activity. The PHAII mutations appear to disrupt the mechanisms underlying Ca2+-sensitivity of WNK4 kinase. Two mechanisms are important in this regard. First, the PHAII-causing mutations in the acidic motif make the kinase domain insensitive to Ca2+ concentration. The acidic motif of WNK4 potentially acts as a Ca2+ sensor, and WNK4 kinase activity rises when Ca2+ concentration is elevated. This has been demonstrated using isolated WNK4 kinase domain truncated to contain the acidic motif. The kinase activity is elevated when a PHAII-causing mutation is present in the acidic motif, similar to what is observed in a Ca2+-binding state (Fig. 3). Second, the WNK4 C-terminal region containing the calmodulin-binding domain and multiple SGK1 phosphorylation sites inhibits the WNK4 activity at the resting state. However, when Ca2+ levels are elevated, Ca2+/calmodulin complex binds to the C-terminal region, derepressing WNK4 kinase activity. Additionally, the RFXV motif is believed to interact with the autoinhibitory domain and subsequently triggers a conformational change that brings the C-terminal and kinase domain close for the inhibitory effect to take place. Angiotensin II increases the SPAK phosphorylation and activates NCC through a WNK-dependent mechanism. The activation of SPAK and NCC by angiotensin II is abrogated by WNK4 knockdown. Activation of angiotensin II receptor AT1 couples to Gq/11 to activate phospholipase C and to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. An increase in Ca2+ concentration then elevates WNK4 activity through mechanisms described above (Fig. 3, left panel). The PHAII-causing mutations in the acidic motif and the R1185C mutation in the calmodulin-binding domain constitutively activate the WNK4 kinase domain allowing it to function despite the absence of angiotensin II (Fig. 3, right panel). Angiotensin II stimulates the secretion of aldosterone, which induces SGK1. SGK1 influences both the WNK-SPAK-NCC and SGK1-ENaC signaling cascades. There are multiple SGK1 phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region of WNK4 located within or close to the calmodulin-binding domain. SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of these sites is thought to disrupt the effect of the C-terminal inhibitory domain and concomitantly increase WNK4 kinase activity. The alteration of SGK1 phosphorylation by the R1185C mutation is another indication that the mutation disrupts the C-terminal inhibitory mechanism in WNK4 (Fig. 3, right panel). = Dysregulation of WNK4 abundance = Besides WNK1 and WNK4, mutations in two other genes, CUL3 (encoding Cullin 3) and KLHL3 (encoding Kelch Like Family Member 3) have been found in patients with PHAII. These two proteins are part of the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex involved in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of WNK1 and WNK4. The PHAII-causing mutations in KLHL3 and cullin 3 prevent the interactions of these proteins with each other and with WNK1/4. The mutations in these proteins impair the degradation of WNK1/4. This in turn increases the protein abundance of WNK1/4 and concomitantly enhances the total kinase activity. The increased WNK4 kinase activity leads to the hyperactivation of NCC through WNK4-SPAK and/or the OSR1-NCC cascades, ultimately resulting in the retention of sodium and potassium by the kidney. = Elevated WNK4 activity = 286x286px The primary effect of the elevated WNK4 kinase activity is the increase of NCC-mediated sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. The increase in sodium reabsorption in this segment of the nephron reduces the sodium load in the collecting duct, where sodium reabsorption by the ENaC provides the driving force for potassium secretion through ROMK (Fig. 4). The sodium reabsorption by hyperactive NCC overrides the loss of reabsorption by ENaC, and the net effect is moderate sodium retention. Over time, this potentially contributes to the elevated blood pressure observed in PHAII patients. The reduction of potassium secretion by ROMK contributes to the development of hyperkalemia. The direct effects of the elevated WNK4 activity on other channels and transporters, such as ENaC, ROMK, and Ca2+-activated maxi K+ channels, may also contribute to the pathogenesis of PHAII; however, the primary features of PHAII could be explained by the gain-of-function of NCC.

Mount Tenp≈ç was formed in 1831 (Tenp≈ç year 2) as the deposit for earth dug up from dredging the Ajigawa river to allow easier access to Osaka for large ships and to prevent floods. The mountain had an elevation of about 20 meters at the time, and served as a marker for ships entering the Ajigawa river to head to the city of Osaka. Cherry blossom and pine trees were planted on the mountain as people began to set up shops in the area, and the mountain gradually became the visitor attraction that it is now. Images of children playing in this area were sketched in ukiyo-e by Utagawa Hiroshige and other artists. Part of the mountain was leveled to set up an artillery unit to protect the river pass after the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate. As industrialization progressed in the Taish≈ç and Sh≈çwa periods, overuse of groundwater resulted in subsidence, lowering the mountain's elevation even further.

It is a component of the Xic ‚Äì X-chromosome inactivation centre ‚Äì along with two other RNA genes (Jpx and Ftx) and two protein genes (Tsx and Cnbp2). The Xist RNA, a large (17 kb in humans) transcript, is expressed on the inactive chromosome and not on the active one. It is processed in a similar way to mRNAs, through splicing and polyadenylation. However, it remains untranslated. It has been suggested that this RNA gene evolved at least partly from a protein-coding gene that became a pseudogene. The inactive X chromosome is coated with this transcript, which is essential for the inactivation. X chromosomes lacking Xist will not be inactivated, while duplication of the Xist gene on another chromosome causes inactivation of that chromosome. The human XIST gene was discovered by Carolyn J. Brown in the laboratory of Hunt Willard.  Function  X-inactivation is an early developmental process in mammalian females that transcriptionally silences one of the pair of X chromosomes, thus providing dosage equivalence between males and females (see dosage compensation). The process is regulated by several factors, including a region of chromosome X called the X-inactivation center (XIC). The XIST gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome. The transcript is spliced but apparently does not encode a protein. The transcript remains in the nucleus where it coats the inactive X chromosome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but their full length sequences have not been determined. The functional role of the Xist transcript was definitively demonstrated in mouse female ES cells using a novel antisense technology, called peptide nucleic acid (PNA) interference mapping. In the reported experiments, a single 19-bp antisense cell-permeating PNA targeted against a particular region of Xist RNA prevented the formation of Xi and inhibited cis-silencing of X-linked genes. The association of the Xi with macro-histone H2A is also disturbed by PNA interference mapping. The X-inactivation process occurs in mice even in the absence of this gene via epigenetic regulation, but Xist is required to stabilize this silencing.  Gene location  The human Xist RNA gene is located on the long (q) arm of the X chromosome. The Xist RNA gene consists of conserved repeats within its structure and is also largely localized in the nucleus. The Xist RNA gene consists of an A region, which contains 8 repeats separated by U-rich spacers. The A region appears to contain two long stem- loop structures that each include four repeats. An ortholog of the Xist RNA gene in humans has been identified in mice. This ortholog is a 15 kb Xist RNA gene that is also localized in the nucleus. However, the ortholog does not consist of conserved repeats. The gene also consists of an Xist Inactivation Center (XIC), which plays a major role in X-inactivation.  Transcript organization  = A region = right The Xist RNA contains a region of conservation called the repeat A (repA) region that contains up to nine repeated elements. It was initially suggested that repA repeats could fold back on themselves to form local intra-repeat stem-loop structures. Later work using in vitro biochemical structure probing proposed several inter-repeat stem-loop structures. A recent study using in vivo biochemical probing and comparative sequence analysis proposed a revision of the repA structure model that includes both intra-repeat and inter-repeat folding found in previous models as well as novel features (see Figure). In addition to its agreement with the in vivo data, this revised model is highly conserved in rodents and mammals (including humans) suggesting functional importance for repA structure. Although the exact function of the repA region is uncertain, it was shown that the entire region is needed for efficient binding to the Suz12 protein. = C region = The Xist RNA directly binds to the inactive X-chromosome through a chromatin binding region of the RNA transcript. The Xist chromatin binding region was first elucidated in female mouse fibroblastic cells. The primary chromatin binding region was shown to localize to the C-repeat region. The chromatin-binding region was functionally mapped and evaluated by using an approach for studying noncoding RNA function in living cells called peptide nucleic acid (PNA) interference mapping. In the reported experiments, a single 19-bp antisense cell-permeating PNA targeted against a particular region of Xist RNA caused the disruption of the Xi. The association of the Xi with macro-histone H2A is also disturbed by PNA interference mapping.  X-inactivation centre (XIC)  The Xist RNA gene lies within the X-inactivation centre (XIC), which plays a major role in Xist expression and X-inactivation. The XIC is located on the q arm of the X chromosome (Xq13). XIC regulates Xist in cis X-inactivation, where Tsix, an antisense of Xist, downregulates the expression of Xist. The Xist promoter of XIC is the master regulator of X-inactivation. X-inactivation plays a key role in dosage compensation. = Tsix antisense transcript = The Tsix antisense gene is a transcript of the Xist gene at the XIC center. The Tsix antisense transcript acts in cis to repress the transcription of Xist, which negatively regulates its expression. The mechanism behind how Tsix modulates Xist activity in cis is poorly understood; however, there are a few theories on its mechanism. One theory is that Tsix is involved in chromatin modification at the Xist locus and another is that transcription factors of pluripotent cells play a role in Xist repression.  Regulation of the Xist promoter  = Methylation = The Tsix antisense is believed to activate DNA methyl transferases that methylate the Xist promoter, in return resulting in inhibition of the Xist promoter and thus the expression of the Xist gene. Methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) produces an active chromatin structure, which recruits transcription factors and thus allows for transcription to occur, therefore in this case the transcription of Xist. = dsRNA and RNAi = A dsRNA and RNAi pathway have been also proposed to play a role in regulation of the Xist Promoter. Dicer is an RNAi enzyme and it is believed to cleave the duplex of Xist and Tsix at the beginning of X-inactivation, to small ~30 nucleotide RNAs, which have been termed xiRNAs, These xiRNAs are believed to be involved in repressing Xist on the probable active X chromosome based upon studies. A study was conducted where normal endogenous Dicer levels were decreased to 5%, which led to an increase in Xist expression in undifferentiated cells, thus supporting the role of xiRNAs in Xist repression. The role and mechanism of xiRNAs is still under examination and debate. = Tsix independent mechanisms =  Pluripotent cell transcriptional factors  Pluripotent stem cells express transcription factors Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 that seem to play a role in repressing Xist. In the absence of Tsix in pluripotent cells, Xist is repressed, where a mechanism has been proposed that these transcription factors cause splicing to occur at intron 1 at the binding site of these factors on the Xist gene, which inhibits Xist expression A study was conducted where Nanog or Oct4 transcription factors were depleted in pluripotent cells, which resulted in the upregulation of Xist. From this study, it is proposed that Nanog and Oct4 are involved in the repression of Xist expression.  Polycomb repressive complex  Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) consist of a class of polycomb group proteins that are involved in catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (K27), which results in chromatin repression, and thus leads to transcriptional silencing. Xist RNA recruits polycomb complexes to the inactive X chromosome at the onset of XCI. SUZ12 is a component of the PRC2 and contains a zinc finger domain. The zinc finger domain is believed to bind to the RNA molecule. The PRC2 has been observed to repress Xist expression independent of the Tsix antisense transcript, although the definite mechanism is still not known.  Dosage compensation  X-inactivation plays a key role in dosage compensation mechanisms that allow for equal expression of the X and autosomal chromosomes. Different species have different dosage compensation methods, with all of the methods involving the regulation of an X chromosome from one of the either sexes. Some methods involved in dosage compensation to inactivate one of the X chromosomes from one of the sexes are Tsix antisense gene, DNA methylation and DNA acetylation; however, the definite mechanism of X-inactivation is still poorly understood. If one of the X chromosomes is not inactivated or is partially expressed, it could lead to over expression of the X chromosome and it could be lethal in some cases. Turner's Syndrome is one example of where dosage compensation does not equally express the X chromosome, and in females one of the X chromosomes is missing or has abnormalities, which leads to physical abnormalities and also gonadal dysfunction in females due to the one missing or abnormal X chromosome. Turner's syndrome is also referred to as a monosomy X condition.  X-inactivation cycle  Xist expression and X-inactivation change throughout embryonic development. In early embryogenesis, the oocyte and sperm do not express Xist and the X chromosome remains active. After fertilization, when the cells are in the 2 to 4 cell stage, Xist transcripts are expressed from parent X chromosome(Xp) in every cell, causing that X chromosome to become imprinted and inactivated. Some cells develop into pluripotent cells (the inner cell mass) when the blastocyte forms. There, the imprint is removed, leading to the downregulation of Xist and thus reactivation of the inactive X chromosome. Recent data suggests that Xist activity is regulated by an anti- sense transcript. The epiblast cells are then formed and they begin to be differentiated, and the Xist is upregulated from either of the two X chromosomes and at random in ICM, but the Xist is maintained in epiblast, an X is inactivated and the Xist allele is turned off in the active X chromosome. In maturing XX primordial germ cells, Xist is downregulated and X reactivation occurs once again.  Disease linkage  Mutations in the XIST promoter cause familial skewed X-inactivation.  Interactions  XIST has been shown to interact with BRCA1.

It was first described in 1990.  Gene  In humans, the gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q13.33) on the Watson (positive strand). The gene is 40,867 bases in length and the encoded protein has 198 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 22.149 kiloDaltons (kDa). The weight of the mature protein is 34kDa. This gene is highly conserved and found both in invertebrates and vertebrates. In humans, a pseudogene of this gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 8.  Structure  The organisation of the protein is as follows: * an N-terminus phosphorylation site for protein kinase A * a J domain (~70 amino acids) * a linker region * a cysteine motif consisting of 13‚Äì15 cysteines within a stretch of 25 amino acids. It is heavily palmitoylated in the cysteine string motif. * a less conserved C-terminal domain  Tissue distribution  This protein is abundant in neural tissue and displays a characteristic localization to synaptic and clathrin coated vesicles. It is also found on secretory vesicles in endocrine, neuroendocrine and exocrine cells. This protein makes up ~1% of the protein content of the synaptic vesicles. DNAJC5 appears to have a role in stimulated exocytosis.  Function  The encoded protein is a member of the J protein family. These proteins function in many cellular processes by regulating the ATPase activity of 70 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70). DNAJC5 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for GŒ± proteins. CSPŒ± plays a role in membrane trafficking and protein folding, and has been shown to have anti- neurodegenerative properties. It is known to play a role in cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease. This protein has been proposed as a key element of the synaptic molecular machinery devoted to the rescue of synaptic proteins that have been unfolded by activity dependent stress. Syntaxin 1A, a plasma membrane SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) critical for neurotransmission, forms a complex with CSPŒ±, a G protein and an N-type calcium channel. Huntingtin may be able displace both syntaxin 1A and CSPŒ± from N-type channels. CSP interacts with the calcium sensor protein synaptotagmin 9 via its linker domain. Huntingtin-interacting protein 14, a palmitoyl transferase, is required for exocytosis and targeting of CSP to synaptic vesicles. The palmitoyl residues are transferred to the cysteine residues. If these resides are mutated membrane targeting is reduced or lost. The rat CSP forms a complex with Sgt (SGTA) and Hsc70 (HSPA8) located on the synaptic vesicle surface. This complex functions as an ATP-dependent chaperone that reactivates denatured substrates. Furthermore, the Csp/Sgt/Hsc70 complex appears to be important for maintenance of normal synapses. Its expression may be increased with the use of lithium. Quercetin promotes formation of stable CSPŒ±-CSPŒ± dimers. Cysteine-string protein increases the calcium sensitivity of neurotransmitter exocytosis.  Interactions  DNAJC5 has been shown to interact with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene may cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

Built during 1862‚Äì1864 in the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV), it runs from the old city centre in Rattanakosin Island, passes through Bangkok's Chinatown, continues into Bang Rak District, where it formerly served the community of European expatriates, and ends in Bang Kho Laem. Construction of the road marked a major change in Bangkok's urban development, with the major mode of transport shifting from water to land. Charoen Krung Road was Bangkok's main street up to the early 20th century, but later declined in prominence. It is still home to many historic buildings and neighbourhoods, which are beset by changes as extension of the underground MRT is poised to drive new development. History Until the mid-19th century, the primary means of transport in Bangkok (and Siam in general) was by boat. This began to change as the country opened up to Western ideas and influences, and underwent modernization during the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV, r. 1851‚Äì1868). The signing of the Bowring Treaty in 1855 marked the beginning of increasing Western political and economic influence, and many foreigners set up diplomatic missions, trading companies and residences on the east bank of the Chao Phraya River, just beyond the newly expanded city limits marked by Phadung Krung Kasem Canal, which had been dug in 1851. British legation (pictured c. 1908) was among the European diplomatic missions which came to be served by Charoen Krung Road. On 19 August 1861, Western consuls, complaining of ill health due to a lack of roads in which they could travel by horse-drawn carriage, requested that the King build a new road on the east side of the river behind the consulates and businesses. The King agreed to the request, and ordered the construction of a new system of roads. The first, which would serve the European district, was begun in 1862 and officially opened to traffic on 16 March 1864.G.B. McFarland, \\"Historical Sketch of Protestant Missions in Siam 1828‚Äì1928\\" Bangkok: White Lotus Press, 1999, p.62. At the time, roads were not officially named, and the road became known as Thanon Mai () or New Road. King Mongkut later gave it the name Charoen Krung, which means \\"prosperous city\\" or \\"prosperity of the city\\". The road, constructed in two phases, runs roughly parallel to the Chao Phraya River in a southerly direction from the city centre. The first section ran from the old city moat, crossed Phadung Krumg Kasem Canal, and continued through the European district to end in Bang Kho Laem, where the river made a sharp turn to the east. The second phase, within the old city walls, ran from Wat Pho to meet the earlier section at Saphan Lek (\\"iron bridge\\"). When the road was first built, locals remarked of its size and width that there just weren't enough people to walk such large a street. In fact, only one side of the road was regularly used until it was renovated and paved with asphalt in 1922. Postcard of Charoen Krung Road, c. 1910s‚Äì1920s The construction of Charoen Krung Road‚Äîtogether with Bamrung Mueang, built shortly after‚Äîmarked a major change in Bangkok's urban landscape. Land transport soon overtook canals in importance, and the growth of the city now followed roads instead. Charoen Krung remained the city's main road and largest thoroughfare up to the early 20th century, when development expanded in-land along the direction of Bamrung Mueang instead. The city's first tram line began operation on Charoen Krung in 1888. Originally horse-drawn, the tram was electrified in 1894. The service ran until its discontinuation in 1963. Charoen Krung's importance gradually declined as the city's rapid expansion in the latter half of the 20th century drew real estate development elsewhere. The southern section, although the site of many historic buildings, has lagged in economic potential; up to 20 percent of its commercial buildings were unoccupied in 2013. Lately, in an attempt at urban renewal, there have been efforts to promote the southern Charoen Krung neighbourhood as a creative district. Meanwhile, construction of the Blue Line extension of Bangkok's MRT system, which runs directly under Charoen Krung as it passes through the Chinatown and Rattnakaosin areas, has raised concerns that historic communities are being displaced by development. Places Charoen Krung Road runs for through the districts of Phra Nakhon, Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong (dividing the two), Bang Rak, Sathon and Bang Kho Laem. It begins at Sanam Chai Road, at the corners of the Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Saranrom Park and the Territorial Defense Command headquarters. It heads east through the Rattanakosin Island, crossing the inner moat at Saphan Mon (\\"Mon Bridge\\"), and passes the Ban Mo and Wang Burapha neighbourhoods, as well as the Sala Chalermkrung Royal Theatre. The road crosses Khlong Ong Ang (the outer moat) at Damrong Sathit Bridge, which is the site of the Saphan Lek market. From here, it serves Bangkok's Chinatown, running southeast, roughly parallel to Yaowarat Road. It passes the historic S.A.B. Intersection near the areas of Nakhon Khasem (Thieves' Market) and Khlong Thom, as well as the Chinese temple Wat Mangkon Kamalawat. The road continues straight until it meets Rama IV Road at Mo Mi Junction, where it bends slightly south. From near the road's beginning at Sanam Chai to Mo Mi Junction, the extension of the MRT's Blue Line runs beneath Charoen Krung, and serves its neighbourhoods via Sam Yot and Wat Mangkon stations, which opened in 2019. From Mo Mi Junction, Charoen Krung heads south to meet Yaowarat Road at the Odeon Circle, where the Chinatown Gate and Wat Traimit are located. The road then passes the neighbourhood of Talat Noi, before crossing Phadung Krung Kasem Canal at Phitthayasathian Bridge. General Post Office building stands on the former site of the British legation. Here, the road enters Bang Rak District and runs through the former European quarter, branching off to historic side-streets such as Soi Charoen Krung 30 (Captain Bush Lane, location of the Portuguese embassy), Soi Charoen Krung 36 (\\"Rue de Brest\\", named to commemorate diplomatic relations with France, whose embassy is located here, along with the Customs House and Haroon Mosque), and Soi Charoen Krung 40 (Soi Burapha, location of the Oriental Hotel, Assumption Cathedral, the Catholic Mission and Assumption College). The General Post Office building is located on the corner of Soi Charoen Krung 32, and Soi 42/1 is home to Wat Suan Phlu and the Shangri-La Hotel. As it passes through Bang Rak, Charoen Krung meets several roads branching off to the northeast, running parallel to each other. Built during the turn of the 19th‚Äì20th centuries as the city expanded southward following the development around Charoen Krung, these roads are Si Phraya, Surawong, Si Lom and Sathon. The latter two form Bangkok's financial district, and on the corner of Charoen Krung and Si Lom stands the State Tower. Charoen Krung meets Sathon Road under the ramps of Taksin Bridge, near the Saphan Taksin Station of the BTS Skytrain. From here, it enters Sathon District, where it passes Wat Yan Nawa, Sathorn Unique Tower, the Bangkok Dock Company and Wat Suthiwararam School. As the road enters Bang Kho Laem District, the area becomes mostly residential. It passes Shrewsbury International School, the Protestant Cemetery, and the Asiatique night market. The final stretch of Charoen Krung Road, after it intersects Rama III Road under Rama III Bridge, is known as Thanon Tok (, \\"falling road\\"), a reference to the fact that if the road continued on, it would fall into the river. At the end of the road is the Yan Nawa office of the Metropolitan Electricity Authority, where one of Bangkok's former trams is preserved as a tourist attraction.

ATPases (or ATP synthases) are membrane-bound enzyme complexes/ion transporters that combine ATP synthesis and/or hydrolysis with the transport of protons across a membrane. ATPases can harness the energy from a proton gradient, using the flux of ions across the membrane via the ATPase proton channel to drive the synthesis of ATP. Some ATPases work in reverse, using the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to create a proton gradient. There are different types of ATPases, which can differ in function (ATP synthesis and/or hydrolysis), structure (F-, V- and A-ATPases contain rotary motors) and in the type of ions they transport. The types with this domain include: * F-ATPases (F1Fo ATPases) are found in mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacterial plasma membranes are the prime producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondria) or photosynthesis (chloroplasts). * V-ATPases (V1Vo ATPases) are primarily found in eukaryotic vacuoles, catalysing ATP hydrolysis to transport solutes and lower pH in organelles. * A-ATPases (A1Ao ATPases) are found in Archaea and function like F-ATPases. * T3SS / flagellum ATPases, which are homologous to both parts of the A/F/V rotary ATPases: strongly in the \\"1\\" part, and weakly in the \\"O\\" part. * Ring-shaped DNA helicases like the Rho factor, where the ring is homologus to the Œ±/Œ≤ subunits. In F-ATPases, there are three copies each of the alpha and beta subunits that form the catalytic core of the F1 complex, while the remaining F1 subunits (gamma, delta, epsilon) form part of the stalks. There is a substrate-binding site on each of the alpha and beta subunits, those on the beta subunits being catalytic, while those on the alpha subunits are regulatory. The alpha and beta subunits form a cylinder that is attached to the central stalk. The alpha/beta subunits undergo a sequence of conformational changes leading to the formation of ATP from ADP, which are induced by the rotation of the gamma subunit, itself is driven by the movement of protons through the Fo complex C subunit. In V- and A-ATPases, the alpha/A and beta/B subunits of the V1 or A1 complex are homologous to the alpha and beta subunits in the F1 complex of F-ATPases, except that the alpha subunit is catalytic and the beta subunit is regulatory. The alpha/A and beta/B subunits can each be divided into three regions, or domains, centred on the ATP-binding pocket, and based on structure and function. The central domain contains the nucleotide-binding residues that make direct contact with the ADP/ATP molecule.

On 21 March 1931, the Southern Cloud departed at 8:10 AM from Sydney for Melbourne. On board were six passengers and two crew, including pilot Travis \\"Shorty\\" Shortridge.ABC Television ‚Äì 7:30 Report 30 October 2008 Weather conditions en route were hazardous and much worse than predicted. The aircraft never reached its destination and disappeared. The search for the missing aircraft lasted 18 days and involved over 20 aircraft. No trace of the missing aircraft was found. Airline co-owner Charles Kingsford Smith joined the search and \\"may have flown over the crash site, but with the aircraft having burned it would be very difficult to distinguish from the air and so the discovery wasn't made.\\" It was Australia's first major airline disaster. Australian National Airways folded later that year as a result of both this and another loss. A film inspired by the accident, The Secret of the Skies, was released in 1934. The Southern Cloud's fate remained a mystery for 27 years until 26 October 1958. On that day, Tom Sonter, a worker on the Snowy Mountains Scheme, made a chance discovery of the wreck. The crash site was in heavily timbered mountainous terrain within the Snowy Mountains about east of the direct Sydney‚ÄìMelbourne route. Investigations concluded that the severe weather conditions at the time of the flight most likely contributed to the crash. A man named Stan Baker had been booked to fly on the fateful journey but cancelled and travelled by train instead. As a result of the aircraft's disappearance, he harboured a lifelong fear of flying ‚Äì which was proved justifiable when he was killed in the 1950 Australian National Airways Douglas DC-4 crash. In Don Bradman's book Farewell to Cricket he mentions that he flew in Southern Cloud with pilot Shortridge from Adelaide to Melbourne, then to Goulburn not long before the tragedy. He described the trip as a 'bumpy journey'.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. LPP3 is a cell-surface glycoprotein that hydrolyzes extracellular lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and short-chain phosphatidic acid. Its function allows it to regulate vascular and embryonic development by inhibiting LPA signaling, which is associated with a wide range of human diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as developmental defects. The PPAP2B gene also contains one of 27 loci associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The PPAP2B gene resides on chromosome 1 at the band 1p32.2 and includes 6 exons. = Protein = LPP3 is a member of the PAP-related phosphoesterase family. It is a type 2 activity PAP, which localizes to the plasma membrane, and is one of four known LPP isoforms. As an integral membrane protein, LPP3 contains six hydrophobic transmembrane domains and a hydrophilic catalytic site composed of three conserved domains. One catalytic domain is proposed to bind the substrate while the other two contribute to dephosphorylation of the substrate. The catalytic site typically faces the extracellular matrix when located on the cell membrane and faces the lumen when located in intracellular membranes. This protein can form homo- and hetero-oligomers.  Function  This protein is a membrane glycoprotein localized at the cell plasma membrane. It has been shown to actively hydrolyze extracellular lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and short-chain phosphatidic acid. [5] As an LPA inhibitor, PPAP2B is known to suppress LPA receptor mediated cellular signaling, which is associated with activation of vascular and blood cells and epithelial cell migration and proliferation. In response to dynamic atherorelevant-flows, PPAP2B can promote anti-inflammatory phenotype via inhibition of LPA signaling and maintain vascular integrity of endothelial monolayer. This flow-sensitive PPAP2B expression is inhibited by microRNA-92a and activated by transcription factor KLF2. In addition to LPA receptor-mediated signaling, PPAP2B is also associated with Wnt signaling, functioning in embryonic development for proper formation of important tissues including bone, heart and muscle. The phenotype of axis duplication in mice globally lacking PPAP2B resembles that observed in animals with altered Wnt signaling. Furthermore, Wnt signaling mediated TCF/LEF-transcription via Œ≤-catenin is upregulated in PPAP2B null embryonic stem cells, implicating LPP3 as a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway.  Clinical Significance  Due to the regulatory role of LPP3 in vascular and embryonic development, inactivation of this protein can contribute to cardiovascular disease and developmental complications. For example, inducible inactivation of LPP3 in both endothelial and hematopoietic cells leads to atherosclerosis due to accumulation of LPA in human plaques. Likewise, plasma LPA levels are significantly elevated in patients with acute coronary syndromes. It was further observed that reduced levels of endothelial LPP3 is associated with disturbed flow and mechano-regulation in blood vessels. During embryonic development in mice, inactivation of LPP3 results in early lethality in part due to failure of extra-embryonic vascular development. Abnormal activation of LPA signaling has also been implicated in cancer, fibrotic disorders, and metabolic syndrome (involving insulin resistance). = Clinical Marker = In humans, PPAP2B emerged as 1 of 13 new loci associated with coronary artery disease by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This prediction appears to be independent of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, obesity, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Additionally, a multi-locus genetic risk score study, based on a combination of 27 loci including the PPAP2B gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22). Taken together, these findings also suggest that PPAP2B and LPA may serve a role in predicting and screening coronary artery disease for early prevention.

It is known to play an important role in the maturation of T cell populations through activation of antigen presenting cells. TSLP is produced mainly by non-hematopoietic cells such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells and different types of stromal or stromal-like cells. These cells are located in regions where TSLP activity is required.  Gene ontology  TSLP production has been observed in various species, including humans and mice. In humans TSLP is encoded by the TSLP gene. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants.  Function  It mainly impacts myeloid cells and induces the release of T cell-attracting chemokines from monocytes and enhances the maturation of myeloid (CD11c+) dendritic cells. TSLP has also been shown to activate the maturation of a specific subset of dendritic cells located within the epidermis, called Langerhans cells. Within the thymus TSLP activation of both myeloid and plasmacytoid (CD123+) dendritic cells results in the production of regulatory T cells. = Signaling = TSLP signals through a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor CRLF2 and the IL-7R alpha chain. After binding STAT5 phosphorylation is induced, resulting in the expression of upstream transcription factors.  Disease  TSLP expression is linked to many disease states including asthma, inflammatory arthritis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, eosinophilic esophagitis and other allergic states. The factors inducing the activation of TSLP release are not clearly defined. = Asthma = Expression of TSLP is enhanced under asthma-like conditions (aka Airway HyperResponsiveness or AHR model in the mouse), conditioning APCs in order to orient the differentiation of T cells coming into the lungs towards a TH2 profile (T helper 2 pathway). The TH2 cells then release factors promoting an inflammatory reaction following the repeated contact with a specific antigen in the airways . = Inflammatory arthritis = = Atopic dermatitis = TSLP-activated Langerhans cells of the epidermis induce the production of pro- inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha by T cells potentially causing atopic dermatitis. It is thought that understanding the mechanism of TSLP production and those potential substances that block the production, one may be able to prevent or treat conditions of asthma and/or eczema.  Inhibition  The TSLP signaling axis is an attractive therapeutic target. Amgen's Tezepelumab, a monoclonal antibody which blocks TSLP, is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of asthma.

It comprises four programmes, each of 55 minutes' duration, which describe man's relationship with the natural habitats of the Mediterranean, and is a glorious portrait of the landscape, wildlife and plants of the Mediterranean. From the earliest human settlements to the cities of today, from the forests of the North African shore and the Middle East to Southern Europe, this series tells the dramatic story of man and nature at work. The series was produced by Andrew Neal, in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and WQED Pittsburgh. The music was composed and conducted by Carl Davis.The First Eden DVD Attenborough undertook the project in between his 'Life' series The Living Planet (1984) and The Trials of Life (1990).  Episodes  = 1. \\"The Making of the Garden\\" = In episode 1, Attenborough travels to Rhodes to witness the gathering of 1 million Jersey tiger moths : UK broadcast 8 March 1987 Attenborough opens the series at the Dead Sea, where the hot climate and intense evaporation mimic conditions that were replicated on a much larger scale when the newly formed Mediterranean basin dried out. Around 5.5 million years ago, the Atlantic flooded the basin, allowing marine life to recolonise the new sea. Mountains became islands: some of them volcanic, others formed of limestone. Common species marooned on these islands evolved into new varieties. In a Maltese cave, Attenborough discovers fossil teeth from dwarf elephants. Most are only known from fossils, but one species, the Mallorcan midwife toad, has recently been discovered. Attenborough abseils down to a secluded pool to find it. In Europe, blooming wildflowers signal the arrival of spring. This triggers the emergence of insects, and in turn, the arrival of insectivorous birds such as rollers and bee-eaters. After the Mediterranean Sea formed, the climate continued to warm, forcing many birds to extend their migration routes between Europe and Africa. Exotic arrivals include spoonbills, white storks and flamingos. Reptiles are most active during the hot summers. Attenborough catches a Montpellier snake and describes its hunting behaviour. Some creatures, including chameleons, crested porcupines and fruit bats have colonised Europe from Africa. Rock hyraxes, which have reached Israel, may soon join them. The arrival of humans, 28,000 years ago, is known from flint tools and rock etchings found in Spanish caves. Later cliff paintings demonstrated that Mediterranean man was still living in hunter-gatherer societies 10,000 years ago, but that would soon change. = 2. \\"The Gods Enslaved\\" = Attenborough in the Great Theatre of Ephesus, from a scene in \\"The Gods Enslaved\\" : UK broadcast 15 March 1987 Attenborough explores the influence of the first Mediterranean civilizations, placing the symbolism of the bull at the centre of his narrative. Cave paintings in France and Spain and Egyptian hieroglyphs both reveal cultures that revered the wild bull for its fertility and strength. The Ancient Egyptians deified many animals, including the living bull-god Apis, and accorded it the same ceremonial burial as their Pharaohs. Attenborough describes the ritual from the Temple of Apis in Memphis. At Saqqara, more than 4 million mummified sacred ibises were brought as offerings by devotees. Crop cultivation began in the Nile Delta, but the Minoans were the first to harvest olives, using oxen-powered mills to crush them. They were also skilled fishermen, whose traditional methods for catching octopus and tunny are still practised by modern North Africans. Attenborough explains how Cretan men pitted themselves against bulls in specially built arenas. The Romans were passionate hunters, using wild animals ransacked from their Empire for entertainment, but they also held the bull in special regard. The statue of Artemis, salvaged from the Temple of Ephesus, is adorned with bulls' testes. Of more than 600 Roman cities along the North African coast, Leptis Magna was the greatest. Its wealth was built on trading livestock and produce harvested from the surrounding fertile lands; figs, olives and grain. But in deforesting the land the Romans precipitated their own demise. Although humans had enslaved and subdued the bull, Attenborough concludes that they had yet to learn the value of the natural world. = 3. \\"The Wastes of War\\" = : UK broadcast 22 March 1987 The relationship between man and horse has a long history in the Mediterranean region. A passion for horses spread west from Central Asia, but took a while to become established as a pastoral way of life returned. The Roman Empire was replaced by marauding Huns, Visigoths and Vandals. In the seventh century, Arabian cavalrymen took Jerusalem and arrived in Spain to spread the word of the Qur'an. They established bases at C√≥rdoba and Granada, bringing orange trees and peacocks for the gardens of their impressive mosques. The Arabs brought their falconry skills too. The birds are used to this day to catch desert animals such as hares and houbara bustards. Many attitudes towards animals stemmed from pre- Christian beliefs. Fire salamanders were suspected of having magical powers, while the mandrake was thought to be deadly to those who harvested its roots. Even today, Cocullo holds an annual festival of snakes, the animals thought to bring protection. Attenborough visits the impregnable Krak des Chevaliers in Syria to discuss the Crusades. Black rats carried on the retreating Christian army‚Äôs ships spread plague through Europe, killing a third of the population. During the Middle Ages the forests of Southern Europe were cleared. Attenborough discusses the deforestation caused by Spanish Merino sheep grazing and the Venetian shipbuilding industry. Despite the advent of the internal combustion engine, horses still play an important role in European culture. The final scenes show thoroughbreds racing at Newmarket and a performance by the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. = 4. \\"Strangers in the Garden\\" = : UK broadcast 29 March 1987 The final episode examines man's impact on the Mediterranean during the twentieth century. Attenborough dines on red soldierfish in Cyprus, one of a hundred or so species to have colonised the Mediterranean from the Red Sea, via the Suez Canal. Other invaders have been less welcome. The Phylloxera aphid from North America attacked French grapevines, and only by importing insect-resistant rootstock from the USA was a total catastrophe averted. The growth of tourism has led to uncontrolled development of hotels and marinas, squeezing out natural inhabitants of the coast such as Mediterranean monk seals and loggerhead turtles, who come ashore to lay their eggs. The sea is in danger of becoming barren due to overfishing and pollution. Attenborough dives beneath the surface to demonstrate the difference between a thriving seagrass ecosystem and one smothered in sedimentation from untreated sewage. Meanwhile, in Egypt, he looks at the damaging effects of damming the Nile, which include reduced productivity, a collapse of Egypt's sardine fishery and population displacement. The shooting of millions of migrating birds, draining of wetlands and deliberately started wildfires add to the pressures on the natural world. There are, however, still a few places where the Mediterranean has been left unspoilt. One is Plitvice in Croatia, whose mixed forests provide shelter for many creatures driven or hunted out elsewhere. In the uninhabited Sporades Islands east of mainland Greece, Mediterranean rarities such as Audouin's gull, Eleonora's falcon and the European black vulture can still breed freely.

It was constructed by the real estate companies Hines, Pontiac Land Group and Goldman Sachs. 53W53 is tall. The building had been in development since 2006, but was delayed for several years due to disputes over the design and difficulties in securing financing. Construction began in late 2014. It was officially topped out in August 2018 and completed the next year. , 53 West 53 is the seventh- tallest completed building in the city. History = Planning = The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), which owned the building's lot, completed a major expansion in 2004 and sold the lot to developer Gerald D. Hines for $125 million in 2007. The developer also bought air rights from the University Club of New York and St. Thomas Church. Hines planned to build a skyscraper called Tower Verre on the site. The building, designed by Jean Nouvel, initially was proposed to stand 1,250 feet (381 m) tall (the same height as the Empire State Building below its mast). Nicolai Ouroussoff of The New York Times called the project \\"one of the most exciting additions to New York's skyline in a generation\\". Tower Verre ran into considerable opposition. Residents and preservationists said that the design would \\"prevent it from harmoniously fitting into its surroundings\\", and state senator Liz Krueger said that the building would \\"overwhelm the area‚Äôs infrastructure and services\\". On September 9, 2009, the New York City Planning Commission said the building could be built if were clipped off the top. The decision was derided by several prominent architecture critics. The version was approved by the New York City Council on October 28, 2009, in a 44-3 vote. =Construction= Financing had been scarce until October 2013, when the Kwee brothers' Pontiac Land agreed to provide $200 million in equity, supported by an $860 million loan from a consortium of Asian banks. In September 2014, the air rights were purchased from MoMA and the building became known as 53 West 53. Pontiac Land Group and Goldman Sachs served as Hines' development partners on the building, and together they secured an $860 million construction loan from a consortium of Asian banks including United Overseas Bank, Maybank, OCBC Bank, and DBS Bank. Construction started in 2015. By July 2016, construction management company Lend Lease had completed excavation and foundation work with superstructure concrete up to the 8th floor.Construction Photos: 53W53, NYC The building officially topped-out in August 2018, with the final apex of the building being put in in late December 2018.

The building's skin contains a faceted facade that tapers to a set of crystalline peaks at the apex of the tower. , 53 West 53 is the seventh- tallest completed building in the city. = Amenities = The building is mixed-use, with gallery space, condominiums, and a private restaurant. There are 145 residences, from one to five bedroom options. One bedroom residences are priced from $3 million and the top floor duplex penthouse is priced at over $80 million. The project added some of gallery space to MoMA. Residents have special privileges at MoMA, including unlimited free admission to the museum, exhibition previews, discounts in MoMA stores, and access to film screenings. The building also includes a private formal dining room, priority access to an in-building restaurant, a library with a fireplace, a children's playroom, a wine tasting room and a lounge with Central Park views available for events.

First elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Republican in 2006, Swalm represented House District 37, which encompasses the most of the city of Centennial, Colorado. Term limited, he did not run for re-election in 2014, so his term ended in January 2015.Ballotpedia. Spencer Swalm. Viewed: 2017-01-29. Early career Born in Colorado, Swalm attended Colorado College before transferring to the University of Colorado at Boulder, graduating with a bachelor's degree in history in 1975. He then earned a J.D. from the University of Denver in 1979. After practicing law for over a decade, specializing in estate planning, Swalm entered the employee benefits and health insurance business in 1990 as a partner in Redstone Benefit Systems. He has served as the chair of the legislative committee of the Colorado State Association of Health Underwriters. In the early 1980s, Swalm began writing op-ed pieces opposing government transportation subsidies and joined the Independence Institute, a Colorado free-market think tank, eventually becoming a senior fellow. He opposed the 2004 tax measure funding the FasTracks light rail expansion. He has also served on the board of the Colorado Council on Economic Education. Politically, Swalm has been a member of the Colorado Republican Business Coalition, the Centennial Republican Forum, the Arapahoe County Republican Men's Club, and was treasurer for the Sixth Congressional District Republican Committee. Swalm is married; he and his wife, Marleen, have three children: Byron, Lauren, and Jocelyn. Swalm has taught Sunday school and served on the missions committee of his church, Grace Chapel, and has taken several missionary trips to the Amazon Basin in Bolivia. Political career =2006 election= Swalm won election to Colorado's 37th House District in 2006. He faced Centennial Councilwoman Betty Ann Habig in the Republican primary, losing to her at the party assembly, but defeating her in the party primary. He then defeated Democrat Angela Engel with just over 51 percent of the vote. =2007 legislative session= In the 2007 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Swalm sat on the House Health and Human Services Committee and the House Transportation and Energy Committee. Swalm's father, Paul Swalm, had served on the Denver, Colorado city council and in the Colorado House of Representatives in the 1970s, and Swalm was assigned the same seat in the house chamber as his father. That year, Swalm sponsored legislation that would require sex offenders to register their email addresses and other online identities with the state. After being defeated in committee, the bill was resubmitted to apply only to sex offenders whose victims are children, and was signed into law. He plans on submitting legislation to extend the program to all sex offenders in future sessions. Swalm also sponsored successful legislation designed to encourage Coloradans to purchase long term care insurance rather than relying on Medicaid, allowing Coloradans to participate in a federal long term care partnership program. Between legislative sessions, Swalm served on the interim Health Care Task Force and on the Transportation Legislation Review Committee. =2008 legislative session= For the 2008 legislative session, Swalm plans to sponsor a measure that would create a special pass to offset state park maintenance costs. As part of a set of Republican health care proposals, Swalm will sponsor legislation to create a low-cost state health insurance plan and to encourage tax breaks for individual health insurance. He has also, working with Democratic Rep. Morgan Carroll, introduced legislation to extend a fund to provide financial assistance to military families. The bill was passed by the legislature and signed into the law by Gov. Bill Ritter. Swalm also introduced legislation to create the \\"Colorado Health Plan,\\" a low-cost health insurance program to be run by the state, but the proposal was killed in committee. Democratic House Speaker Andrew Romanoff has expressed interest in reviving the bill. Swalm also reintroduced his bill to require sex offenders to register their email addresses, which was again killed in committee. =2008 election= Because of the closeness of Swalm's 2006 election in a traditionally Republican district, Democrats targeted Swalm's re-election bid in 2008. Swalm faces Diana Holland, a Democrat and Littleton School Board member, and Constitution Party candidate Brian Olds in the November general election. Swalm's re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post. He ultimately won with 51 percent of the popular vote, nearly 2000 votes ahead of Holland. =2009 legislative session= For the 2009 legislative session, Swalm was named to seats on the House Finance Committee and the House Health and Human Services Committee. Representative Swalm worked with centrist Democratic Representative Sara Gagliardi to promote a bipartisan measure lowering the age limit for blood donations to 16. =2011 legislative session= Representative Swalm returned to the House Committee on Finance. He was also appointed as vice-chair of the newly renamed Economic & Business Development Committee. =2012 election= In the 2012 General Election, Representative Swalm faced Democratic challenger Jan Spooner. Swalm was elected by a margin of 53% to 44% with third party candidates garnering the remainder of the vote.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors. This gene product is one of two closely related family members, the HAND proteins Hand1 and Hand2, which are asymmetrically expressed in the developing ventricular chambers and play an essential role in cardiac morphogenesis. Working in a complementary fashion, they function in the formation of the right ventricle and aortic arch arteries, implicating them as mediators of congenital heart disease. In addition, this transcription factor plays an important role in limb and branchial arch development. In one study, it was found that a missense mutation of the Hand2 protein in patients with the congenital heart disease (CHD) Tetralogy of Fallot experienced significantly decreased Hand2 interactions with other key developmental genes such as GATA4 and NKX2.5. Hand2 mutations have the potential to be genes for the future study of right ventricle stenosis and its pathogenesis. In avian species, Hand2 has been shown to be expressed in developing gut tissue and is believed to contribute to the formation of enteric neurons. Hand2 also plays a critical role in the establishment of a proper implantation environment for pregnancy in mice. The induction of Hand2 by progesterone-dependent mechanisms in uterine stromal tissue suppresses fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that would otherwise stimulate estrogen producing pathways and impair embryo implantation. Hand2 plays a role in lower jaw formation and tongue morphogenesis in mice by suppressing the homeobox genes Dlx5 and Dlx6.  Interactions  HAND2 has been shown to interact with GATA4, NKX2.5, PPP2R5D, PHOX2A., TWIST1, and TWIST2.  Clinical significance  Hand2 interactions with TWIST1 and TWIST2 genes are critical for proper limb development. Recent literature shows over dosage of Hand2 can result in many defects in the limbs, face, heart, and lower lumbar vertebrae. In this instance, trisomy of the hand2 gene can directly cause human congenital heart disease. Hand2 gene hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing has also been implicated to increase the development of endometrial cancer. Mounting evidence showing its methylation increased chances of premalignant endometrial lesions. Hand2, in addition to its other functions in the developing heart and limbs, has been found to be an important transcription factor seen in the endometrial stroma. In fact, in mice with the Hand2 gene knocked out, they developed premalignant lesions as they grew older, further providing evidence of its role in endometrial cancer development. These findings have led to Hand2 becoming a potentially promising biomarker for early detection of endometrial cancer and may be used to predict its treatment. Regulation of Hand2 HAND2 is an important transcription factor in development of the endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) which allows for the development of the cardiac cushion in the atrioventricular canal which forms the mitral and tricuspid valves. The Hand2 gene regulatory network contains many genes that function in the EMT process, most notably Snail1, whose expression is lost if Hand2 is deficient. Since HAND2 is essential for separation of the atria and ventricles, a mutation in this gene has been linked to ventricular septal defects. Deficiency in HAND2 is only partially replaced by SNAIL1. The expression of Hand2 is regulated by an upstream long non-coding RNA called Upperhand (Uph) that is needed for RNA polymerase II to transcribe Hand2. If Uph is not present, then there is a decrease in the expression of Hand2 and thus a decrease in cardiac development. When Uph was knocked out, the right ventricular chamber did not develop and had a similar phenotype as when Hand2 is knocked out. In addition, Hand2 expression was absent in the atria, ventricles, and outflow tract of the heart and was reduced in the brachial arches and limb buds.

The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Original Song for \\"It's Magic\\" (music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Sammy Cahn), and Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture (Ray Heindorf).  Plot  Doris Day as Georgia Garrett, singing \\"I'm in Love\\". Elvira Kent (Janis Paige) and her husband Michael (Don DeFore) suspect each other of cheating. For their wedding anniversary, Elvira books an ocean cruise to Rio de Janeiro but her husband claims that unexpected business will prevent him from going. Seeing an opportunity, Elvira pretends to take the trip alone, but in fact sends singer Georgia Garrett (Doris Day), a woman she'd met at the travel agency, in her place and under her name. By secretly staying behind, Elvira hopes to find out if Michael is indeed sneaking around behind her back. Michael, however, is suspicious over Elvira's supposed willingness to go on the trip alone, and so hires private detective Peter Virgil (Jack Carson) to see if she is sneaking around behind his back. Peter joins the cruise and, as part of his job, becomes acquainted with Georgia. Georgia, following the instructions of the real Elvira, keeps up the ruse by pretending to be Elvira to everyone, including Peter. Georgia and Peter are attracted to each other and gradually fall in love, which causes conflict for both of them. During one of the cruise stops, Georgia's friend, Oscar Farrar (Oscar Levant), comes on board. Oscar is in love with Georgia despite Georgia's lack of interest in him, and when Peter spots them together, he thinks he has discovered the identity of Elvira's lover. The film's third act is set in a Rio hotel, where all the principal characters converge and ride a merry-go-round of mistaken identities. Sorting out their true identities, as well as resolving the crossed love plots, concludes the picture.

Other established stars like Judy Garland and Jane Powell were briefly considered, before Michael Curtiz was persuaded to audition Doris Day, then known as a band vocalist, but hitherto not considered an actress. Her personal life was in some turmoil at the time, as her second marriage, to musician George Weidler, was ending, and this, combined with her evident nervousness, led her to deliver a notably teary, emotive version of Embraceable You at the audition. Impressed by her singing ability and fresh- faced good looks, Curtiz signed her to a film contract and cast her in the leading role of Georgia Garrett. Despite the change in star and the late casting of Janis Paige, the film was financially successful. Before meeting Hutton's replacement, director Curtiz's requirements were that she had to be beautiful, that she had to be able to sing and dance, and that, above all, she must have \\"sparkle.\\" After dozens of young women failed to match Curtiz's specifications, Doris Day was finally introduced to him. He immediately perked up and exclaimed, \\"This is it. This is the most everything dame I have ever seen.\\"McDonald, Tamar Jeffers. Doris Day Confidential: Hollywood, Sex, and Stardom.

Debtors in the 18th century who could afford the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave them a chance to earn money for their creditors. Everyone else was crammed into one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and thumbscrews. A parliamentary committee reported in 1729 that 300 inmates had starved to death within a three-month period, and that eight to ten were dying every 24 hours in the warmer weather. The prison became known around the world in the 19th century through the writing of the English novelist Charles Dickens, whose father was sent there in 1824, when Dickens was 12, for a debt to a baker. Forced as a result to leave school to work in a factory, Dickens based several of his characters on his experience, most notably Amy Dorrit, whose father is in the Marshalsea for debts so complex no one can fathom how to get him out. Much of the prison was demolished in the 1870s, although parts of it were used as shops and rooms into the 20th century. A local library now stands on the site. All that is left of the Marshalsea is the long brick wall that marked its southern boundary, the existence of what Dickens called \\"the crowding ghosts of many miserable years\\" recalled only by a plaque from the local council. \\"[I]t is gone now,\\" he wrote, \\"and the world is none the worse without it.\\"Dickens, Little Dorrit, pp. vii, 41. Background =Etymology, Marshalsea Court= Inside the Marshalsea Court, 1800, part of the prison Marshalsea or marshalcy referred to the office of a marshal, derived from the Anglo-French mareschalcie. Marshal originally meant farrier, from the Old Germanic marh (horse) and scalc (servant), later a title bestowed on those presiding over the courts of Medieval Europe.\\"Marshal\\", \\"Marshalcy\\" and \\"Marshalsea\\", Oxford English Dictionary, 1989; \\"Marshalcy\\", Chambers, 1983. Marshalsea was originally the name of the Marshalsea Court. The prison was built to hold those brought before that court and the Court of the King's Bench, to which Marshalsea rulings could be appealed. Also known as the Court of the Verge, and the Court of the Marshalsea of the Household of the Kings of England, the Marshalsea court was a jurisdiction of the royal household. From around 1290, it governed members of the household who lived within \\"the verge\\", defined as within of the king. From 1530 to 1698 the verge was usually 12 miles around the Palace of Whitehall, the royal family's main residence, but the Marshalsea was an ambulatory court that moved around the country with the king, dealing with trespass, contempt and debt. Increasingly it came to be used by people not connected to the royal household.Jones 1970, pp. 7‚Äì8; McIntosh 1979, pp. 728, 733. =Southwark= Settled by the Romans around 43 CE, Southwark served as an entry point into London from southern England, particularly along Watling Street, the Roman road from Canterbury. This ran into what is now Southwark's Borough High Street and from there north to old London Bridge.Thornbury 1872, p. 17; Philpotts 2003, p. 90. The area became known for its travellers and inns, including Geoffrey Chaucer's Tabard Inn. The itinerant population brought with it poverty, prostitutes, bear baiting, theatres (including Shakespeare's Globe) and prisons. In 1796 there were five prisons in Southwark‚Äîthe Clink, King's Bench, Borough Compter, White Lion and the Marshalsea‚Äîcompared to 18 in London as a whole.Philpotts 2003, p. 90. =Prisons in England= Notice remaining on a bridge in Sturminster Newton, Dorset, warning that anyone who damages it may be subject to penal transportation Until the 19th century imprisonment in England was not viewed as a punishment, except for minor offences such as vagrancy; prisons simply held people until their creditors had been paid or their fate decided by judges. Options included execution (ended 1964), flogging (1961), the stocks (1872), the pillory (1830), the ducking stool (1817), joining the military, or penal transportation to America or Australia (1867).McGowen 1995, p. 72; West 2011, p. 164. In 1774 there were just over 4,000 prisoners in Britain, half of them debtors, out of a population of six million.West 2011, p. 164. (In 2010 there were over 85,000 prisoners in England and Wales out of a population of 56 million.)Alan Travis (23 April 2010). \\"Prison population hits record 85,000 after end of early releases\\", The Guardian. Lizzy Davis and Simon Rogers (16 July 2012). \\"England and Wales population rises 3.7m in 10 years\\", The Guardian. Eighteenth-century prisons were effectively lodging houses. Poorly maintained and often filthy, they might consist of a couple of rooms in a cellar. Before the Gaols Act 1823, then the Prisons Act 1835 and the Prison Act 1877, they were administered by the royal household, the aristocracy and the bishops, and run for profit by private individuals who bought the right to manage and make money from them.McGowen 1995, pp. 71‚Äì73. Prisoners had to pay rent, feed and clothe themselves and, in the larger prisons, furnish their rooms. One man found not guilty at trial in 1669 was not released because he owed prison fees from his pre-trial confinement, a position supported by the judge, Matthew Hale.McGowen 1997, p. 74. Jailers sold food or let out space for others to open shops; the Marshalsea contained several shops and small restaurants. Prisoners with no money or external support faced starvation. If the prison did supply food to its non-paying inmates, it was purchased with charitable donations‚Äîdonations sometimes siphoned off by the jailers‚Äîusually bread and water with a small amount of meat, or something confiscated as unfit for human consumption.McGowen 1995, pp. 73‚Äì74; Philpotts 1991; Hughes 1998, p. 37. Jailers would load prisoners with fetters and other iron, then charge for their removal, known as \\"easement of irons\\" (or \\"choice of irons\\"); this became known as the \\"trade of chains\\".Griffiths 1884, pp. 211, 429‚Äì431; Hughes 1988, p. 37. The prison reformer John Howard travelled around the country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of the Prisons in England and Wales (1777).West 2011, p. 169ff. In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to the floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11 ft √ó 11 ft and 6 ft high, with a small window. The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.For Ely, Howard 1777, pp. 252‚Äì253 (footnote), and Griffiths 1884, p. 429\\\\. For Penzance, p. 385, and for Chesterfield, p. 286. =Debt in England= Artist's impression of Charles Dickens, forced to work in a factory when his father was sent to the Marshalsea Before the Bankruptcy Act 1869, debtors in England were routinely imprisoned at the pleasure of their creditors. Around 10,000 people in England and Wales were in prison for debt in 1641, often for small amounts.Barty-King 1991, p. 38. In the 18th century debtors comprised over half the prison population: 945 of London's 1,500 prisoners in 1779 were debtors.White 2012, p. 447. According to John Wade, writing in 1829, in London in 1826‚Äì1827, 753 people were imprisoned for debts under ¬£5, for between 20 and 100 days. In Southwark that year the debts of 1,893 prisoners amounted collectively to ¬£16,442 (over ¬£1 million in 2014).Wade 1829, p. 124. Other European countries had legislation limiting imprisonment for debt to one year, but debtors in England were imprisoned until their creditors were satisfied.Brown 1996, p. 108. When the Fleet Prison closed in 1842, two debtors were found to have been there for 30 years.Ashton 1888, p. 321. Prisoners would often take their families with them, which meant that entire communities sprang up inside the debtors' jails. The community created its own economy, with jailers charging for room, food, drink and furniture, or selling concessions to others, and attorneys charging fees in fruitless efforts to get the debtors out. Prisoners' families, including children, often had to find employment simply to cover the cost of the imprisonment.For the way debts increased, White 2009, p. 74. Legislation began to address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760‚Äì1820), new legislation prevented debts of under 40 shillings leading to jail (¬£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14 days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed ¬£20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.Small 2003, p. 909. First Marshalsea (1373‚Äì1811) =Overview, sources= Southern front of the north side of the first Marshalsea, 1773. The building with columns contained a courthouse. The door to the notorious strong room, where prisoners were held next to the prison sewer, is farthest on the right. The Marshalsea occupied two buildings on the same street in Southwark. The first dated back to the 14th century at what would now be 161 Borough High Street, between King Street and Mermaid Court.Philpotts 2003, p. 91. By the late 16th century the building was \\"crumbling\\".Adams 2009, p. 221. In 1799 the government reported that it would be rebuilt south on what is now 211 Borough High Street. Measuring around , with a turreted front lodge, the first Marshalsea was set slightly back from Borough High Street.Ginger 1998, p. 41. There is no record of when it was built. Historian Jerry White writes that it existed by 1300, but according to Ida Darlington, editor of the 1955 Survey of London, there is a mention of \\"the good men of the town of Suthwerk\\" being granted a licence in 1373 to build a house on Southwark's High Street to hold prisoners appearing before the Marshalsea of the King's household. Darlington writes that earlier mentions of a Marshalsea prison may refer to other prisons, one kept by the Knight Marshal at York and another at Canterbury. There is a reference to the Marshalsea prison in Southwark being set on fire in 1381 by Wat Tyler during the Peasants' Revolt.White 2009, p. 71. John Cope, esquire, is described as marshal of the marshalsea hospice in 1412;http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H4/CP40no605/bCP40ono605dorses/IMG_1472.htm ; 5th entry from bottom William Bradwardyn was described as marshal in 1421.second entry; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H5/CP40no641/bCP40no641dorses/IMG_1201.htm Most of the first Marshalsea, as with the second, was taken up by debtors; in 1773 debtors within 12 miles of Westminster could be imprisoned there for a debt of 40 shillings.Noorthouck 1773, pp. 678‚Äì690. Jerry White writes that London's poorest debtors were housed in the Marshalsea. Wealthier debtors secured their removal from the Marshalsea by writ of habeas corpus, and arranged to be moved to the Fleet or King's Bench, both of which were more comfortable.White 2012, p. 449. The prison also held a small number of men being tried at the Old Bailey for crimes at sea. The Marshalsea was technically under the control of the Knight Marshal, but was let out to others who ran it for profit. For example, in 1727 the Knight Marshal, Philip Meadows, hired John Darby, a printer, as prison governor, who in turn leased it to William Acton, a butcher (who was later tried for murdering three of its prisoners). Acton had previously worked as one of the prison's turnkeys. He paid Darby ¬£140 a year (roughly ¬£) for a seven-year lease, giving him the right to act as resident warden and chief turnkey, and an additional ¬£260 for the right to collect rent from the rooms, and sell food and drink.Ginger 1998, p. 45; White 2009, p. 79. Much of our information about the first Marshalsea is about the prison in the early 18th century, courtesy of three sources. John Baptist Grano (1692 ‚Äì c. 1748), one of George Frederick Handel's trumpeters at the opera house in London's Haymarket, was jailed there for a debt of ¬£99 (¬£ today), and kept a detailed diary, A Journal of My Life inside the Marshalsea, of his 458-day incarceration from 30 May 1728 until 23 September 1729.House of Lords Records Office, \\"An Account of the Prisoners in the Marshalsea, February 1729\\", cited in Ginger 1998, p. 25, n. 99; White 2009, p. 84. The other two key sources are a 1729 report by a parliamentary committee, led by James Oglethorpe MP, on the state of the Fleet and the Marshalsea, and the subsequent murder trial that year of William Acton, the Marshalsea's chief jailor. =Master's side= John Howard, the prison reformer, visited the Marshalsea on 16 March 1774. By the 18th century, the prison had separate areas for its two classes of prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50 rooms for rent, and the common or poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300 people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. John Baptist Grano paid 2s 6d (two shillings and six pennies) for a room with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed ¬£9, Benjamin Sandford, a lighterman from Bermondsey who owed ¬£55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller.Ginger 1998, p. 45. Women prisoners who could pay the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were allowed to live with them, if someone was paying their way. Known as the castle by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, with a side room called the pound, where new prisoners would wait until a room was found for them. The front lodge led to a courtyard known as the park. This had been divided in two by a long narrow wall, so that prisoners from the common side could not be seen by those on the master's side, who preferred not to be distressed by the sight of abject poverty, especially when they might themselves be plunged into it at any moment. There was a bar run by the governor's wife, and a chandler's shop run in 1728 by a Mr and Mrs Cary, both prisoners, which sold candles, soap and a little food. There was a coffee shop run in 1729 by a long-term prisoner, Sarah Bradshaw, and a steak house called Titty Doll's run by another prisoner, Richard McDonnell, and his wife. There was also a tailor and a barber, and prisoners from the master's side could hire prisoners from the common side to act as their servants.Ginger 1998, p. 44. The prison reformer John Howard visited the Marshalsea on 16 March 1774. He reported that there was no infirmary, and that the practice of \\"garnish\\" was in place, whereby new prisoners were bullied into giving money to the older prisoners upon arrival.Dixon 1856, p. 166. Five rooms on the master's side were being let to a man who was not a prisoner; he had set up a chandler's shop in one of them, lived in two others with his family, and sublet two to prisoners. During Howard's visit, the tap room, or beer room, had been let to a prisoner who was living \\"within the rules\\" or \\"within the liberty\\" of the King's Bench prison; this meant that he was a King's Bench inmate who, for a fee, was allowed to live outside, within a certain radius of the prison. Although legislation prohibited jailers from having a pecuniary interest in the sale of alcohol within their prisons, it was a rule that was completely ignored. Howard reported that, in the summer of 1775, 600 pots of beer were brought into the Marshalsea one Sunday from a public house, because the prisoners did not like the beer in the tap room.Howard 1777, p. 206; Field 1850, p. 120. =Common side= Instruments of torture used on prisoners, from a report by the Gaols Committee, 1729 Prisoners on the master's side rarely ventured to the common side. John Baptist Grano went there just once, on 5 August 1728, writing in his diary: \\"I thought it would have kill'd me.\\" There was no need for other prisoners to see it, John Ginger writes. It was enough that they knew it existed to keep the rental money, legal fees and other gratuities flowing from their families, fees that anywhere else would have seen them living in the lap of luxury, but which in the Marshalsea could be trusted merely to stave off disease and starvation.Ginger 1998, pp. 46, 67. By all accounts, living conditions in the common side were horrific. In 1639 prisoners complained that 23 women were being held in one room without space to lie down, leading to a revolt, with prisoners pulling down fences and attacking the guards with stones. Prisoners were regularly beaten with a \\"bull's pizzle\\" (a whip made from a bull's penis), or tortured with thumbscrews and a skullcap, a vice for the head that weighed . What often finished them off was being forced to lie in the strong room, a windowless shed near the main sewer, next to piles of night soil and cadavers awaiting burial.Ginger 1998, p. 296; White 2009, p. 83. Dickens described it as \\"dreaded by even the most dauntless highwaymen and bearable only to toads and rats\\".Dickens, All the Year Round, volume 18, p. 252. One apparently diabetic army officer who died in the strong room‚Äîhe had been ejected from the common side because inmates had complained about the smell of his urine‚Äîhad his face eaten by rats within hours of his death, according to a witness.Cobbett 1813, p. 526ff; Hostettler 2009, p. 152. When William Acton ran the jail in the 1720s, the income from charities, collected to buy food for inmates on the common side, was directed instead to a group of trusted prisoners who policed the prison on Acton's behalf. The same group swore during Acton's trial in 1729 for murder that the strong room was the best room in the house.Ginger 1998, p. 296. Ginger writes that Acton and his wife, who lived in a comfortable apartment near the lodge, knew they were sitting on a powder keg: \\"When each morning the smell of freshly baked bread filled ... the yard ... only brutal suppression could prevent the Common Side from erupting.\\" =1729 Gaols Committee= The Gaols Committee of the House of Commons (c. 1729) by William Hogarth. James Oglethorpe MP (seated far left) questions Thomas Bambridge, the Fleet's warden (standing far left). Horace Walpole wrote in 1749: \\"The scene is the committee. On the table are the instruments of torture. A prisoner in rags, half-starved, appears before them. The poor man has a good countenance, that adds to the interest. On the other hand is the inhuman gaoler. It is the very figure that Salvator Rosa would have drawn for Iago in the moment of detection.\\"Walpole 1849, p. 724. The common side did erupt after a fashion in 1728 when Robert Castell, an architect and debtor in the Fleet prison, who had been living in lodgings outside the jail within the rules, was taken to a \\"sponging house\\" after refusing to pay a higher prison fee to the Fleet's notorious warden, Thomas Bambridge. Sponging houses were private lodgings where prisoners were incarcerated before being taken to jail; they acquired the name because they squeezed the prisoner's last money out of him. When Castell arrived at the sponging house on 14 November he was forced to share space with a man who was dying of smallpox, as a result of which he became infected and died less than a month later.Cobbett 1813, p. 383ff; White 2009, p. 76. Castell had a friend, James Oglethorpe, a Tory MP who years later founded the American colony of Georgia. Oglethorpe began to ask questions about the treatment of debtor prisoners, and a group of debtors, perhaps at Oglethorpe's instigation, lodged a complaint about their treatment with the Lord Mayor of London and his aldermen, who interviewed the Fleet's warden on 21 December 1728.Bain 1989, p. 73. In February 1729 the House of Commons appointed a parliamentary committee, the Gaols Committee, chaired by Oglethorpe, to examine conditions in the Fleet and Marshalsea.White 2009, pp. 76‚Äì77. The committee visited the Fleet on 27 February and the Marshalsea on 25 March.Ginger 1998, p. 215. William Hogarth accompanied the committee on its visit to the Fleet, sketching it, then painting it in oil (left). The painting was commissioned by Sir Archibald Grant, MP for Aberdeenshire, standing third from the right. The man in irons is thought to be Jacob Mendez Solas, a Portuguese prisoner.The Gaols Committee of the House of Commons, National Portrait Gallery. The committee was shocked by the prisoners' living conditions. In the Fleet they found Sir William Rich, a baronet, in irons. Unable to pay the prison fee, he had been burned with a red-hot poker, hit with a stick and kept in a dungeon for ten days for having wounded the warden with a shoemaker's knife. In the Marshalsea they found that prisoners on the common side were being routinely starved to death: > All the Support such poor Wretches have to subsist on, is an accidental > Allowance of Pease, given once a week by a Gentleman, who conceals his Name, > and about Thirty Pounds of Beef, provided by the voluntary Contribution of > the Judge and Officers of the Marshalsea, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; > which is divided into very small Portions, of about an Ounce and a half, > distributed with One-Fourth-part of an Half-penny Loaf ... When the > miserable Wretch hath worn out the Charity of his Friends, and consumed the > Money, which he hath raised upon his Cloaths, and Bedding, and hath eat his > last Allowance of Provisions, he usually in a few Days grows weak, for want > of Food, with the symptoms of a hectick Fever; and when he is no longer able > to stand, if he can raise 3d to pay the Fee of the common Nurse of the > Prison, he obtains the Liberty of being carried into the Sick Ward, and > lingers on for about a Month or two, by the assistance of the above- > mentioned Prison Portion of Provision, and then dies.; Ginger 1998, p. 218. =Trial of William Acton= The men's sick ward in the Marshalsea, Gaols Committee, 1729: \\"For along the Side of the Walls of that Ward, Boards were laid upon Trestles, like a Dresser in a Kitchen; and under them, between those Trestles, were laid on the Floor, one Tire [tier] of sick Men, and upon the Dresser another Tire, and over them hung a Third Tire in Hammocks.\\"; Ginger 1998, pp. 218‚Äì219. As a result of the Gaols Committee's inquiries, several key figures within the jails were tried for murder in August 1729, including Thomas Bambridge of the Fleet and William Acton of the Marshalsea. Given the strongly worded report of the Gaols Committee, the trials were major public events. Ginger writes that, when the Prince of Wales's bookseller presented his bill at the end of that year, two of the 41 volumes on it were accounts of William Acton's trial.Ginger 1998, p. 295. Case of Thomas Bliss The first case against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, was for the murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a carpenter and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that he had tried to escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20 feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.; Cobbett 1813, pp. 477, 482; White 2009, pp. 90‚Äì91. Originally built to hold pirates, the strong room was just a few yards from the prison's sewer. It was never cleaned, had no drain, no sunlight, no fresh air‚Äîthe smell was described as \\"noisome\\"‚Äîand was full of rats and sometimes \\"several barrow fulls of dung\\".Corbett 1813, p. 550. Several prisoners told the court that it contained no bed, so that prisoners had to lie on the damp floor, possibly next to corpses awaiting burial. But a group of favoured prisoners Acton had paid to police the jail told the hearing there was indeed a bed. One of them said he often chose to lie in there himself, because the strong room was so clean; the \\"best room on the Common side of the jail\\", said another. This despite the court's having heard that one prisoner's left side had mortified from lying on the wet floor, and that a rat had eaten the nose, ear, cheek and left eye of another.Cobbett 1813, p. 482ff; White 2009, pp. 90‚Äì91. Bliss was left in the strong room for three weeks wearing a skullcap (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital. Other cases, acquittal The court was told of three other cases. Captain John Bromfield, Robert Newton and James Thompson all died after similar treatment from Acton: a beating, followed by time in the hole or strong room, before being moved to the sick ward, where they were left to lie on the floor in leg irons.Cobbett 1813, pp. 512ff, 526ff; White 2009, pp. 90‚Äì91. So concerned was Acton for his reputation that he requested the indictments be read out in Latin, but his worries were misplaced. The government wanted an acquittal to protect the good name of the Knight Marshal, Sir Philip Meadows, who had hired John Darby as prison governor, who in turn had leased the prison to Acton. Acton's favoured prisoners had testified on his behalf, introducing contradictory evidence that the trial judge stressed to the jury. A stream of witnesses spoke of his good character, including a judge, an MP, his butcher, brewer, confectioner and solicitor‚Äîhis coal merchant thought Acton \\"improper for the post he was in from his too great compassion\\"‚Äîand he was found not guilty on all charges.Ginger 1998, pp. 296, 299; White 2009, pp. 91‚Äì92. The Gaols Committee had managed to draw attention to the plight of England's prisoners, but reform had eluded them.Pitofsky 2000, p. 88; White 2009, pp. 92‚Äì93. =Notable prisoners= Ben Jonson was sent to the Marshalsea in 1597 for his play The Isle of Dogs. Although most Marshalsea prisoners were debtors, the prison was second in importance only to the Tower of London. From the 14th century onwards, minor political figures were held there instead of in the Tower, mostly for sedition. William Hepworth Dixon wrote in 1885 that it was full of \\"poets, pirates, parsons, plotters; coiners, libellers, defaulters, Jesuits; vagabonds of every class who vexed the souls of men in power ...\\"Morris and Rothman 1995, p. 351; Dixon 1885, p. 128. During the Elizabethan era, it became the main holding prison for Roman Catholics suspected of sedition. Bishop Bonner, the last Roman Catholic Bishop of London, was imprisoned there in 1559, supposedly for his own safety, until his death 10 years later. William Herle, a spy for Lord Burghley, Elizabeth I's chief adviser, was held there in 1570 and 1571. According to historian Robyn Adams, the prison leaked both physically and metaphorically; in correspondence about Marshalsea prisoners suspected of involvement in a 1571 plot to kill the Queen, Herle wrote of a network within the prison for smuggling information out of it, which included hiding letters in holes in the crumbling brickwork for others to pick up.Adams 2009, pp. 220‚Äì221. Intellectuals regularly found themselves in the Marshalsea. The playwright Ben Jonson, a friend of Shakespeare, was jailed in 1597 for his play The Isle of Dogs, which was immediately suppressed, with no extant copies; on 28 July that year the Privy Council was told it was a \\"lewd plaie that was plaied in one of the plaie houses on the Bancke Side, contaynynge very seditious and sclandrous matter\\".Vickers 2004, p. 25. The poet Christopher Brooke was jailed in 1601 for helping 17-year-old Ann More marry John Donne without her father's consent.Wheatley and Cunningham 1891, p. 477. George Wither, the political satirist, wrote his poem \\"The Shepherds Hunting\\" in 1614 in the Marshalsea; he was held for four months for libel over his Abuses Stript and Whipt (1613), 20 satires criticizing revenge, ambition and lust, one of them directed at the Lord Chancellor. Nicholas Udall, vicar of Braintree and headmaster of Eton College, was sent there in 1541 for buggery and suspected theft; his appointment in 1555 as headmaster of Westminster School suggests that the episode did his name no lasting harm.Carney 2001, p. 355. Thomas Drury was sent to the Marshalsea on 15 July 1591, charged with \\"diuerse greate and fonde matters\\";Kendall 2003, p. 244. Drury was involved in 1593 with the allegation of atheism against the playwright Christopher Marlowe.Riggs 2004, pp. 37‚Äì38. In 1629 the jurist John Selden was jailed there for his involvement in drafting the Petition of Right, a document limiting the actions of the King, regarded as seditious although it had been passed by Parliament. When Sir John Eliot, Vice-Admiral of Devon, was moved to the Marshalsea in 1632 from the Tower of London for questioning the right of the King to tax imports and exports, he described it as leaving his palace in London for his country house in Southwark. Colonel Thomas Culpeper ended up in the Marshalsea in 1685 or 1687 for striking the Duke of Devonshire, William Cavendish, on the ear.Walford 1878. Second Marshalsea (1811‚Äì1842) =Overview= The original title page of Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit shows Amy leaving the Marshalsea. When the prison reformer James Neild visited the first Marshalsea in December 1802, just 34 debtors were living there, along with eight wives and seven children. Neild wrote that it was in \\"a most ruinous and insecure state, and the habitations of the debtors wretched in the extreme\\".Neild 1802, p. 207; also see Edward Cave, writing as \\"Sylvanus Urban\\", the letters editor of Gentleman's Magazine, replying to a reader's letter about the Marshalsea in 1803. There had been riots in the prison in 1749 and 1768.White 2012, p. 454. The government acknowledged in 1799 that it had fallen into a state of decay, and a decision was made to rebuild it 130 yards south (119 m), at 150 High Street (now called Borough High Street), on the site of the White Lion prison, also known as the Borough Gaol.Philpotts 2003, p. 91; Knight 1841, p. 325. This was on the south side of Angel Court and Angel Alley, two narrow streets that no longer exist. Costing ¬£8,000 to complete (¬£ in 2013), the new prison opened in 1811 with two sections, one for Admiralty prisoners under court martial, and one for debtors, with a shared chapel that had been part of the White Lion. =Sources= James Neild visited the Marshalsea again during the first year of the new building's existence, publishing a description of it in 1812. This was supplemented by reports from the Committees and Commissioners on the State and Management of Prisons in London and Elsewhere, published between 1815 and 1818. More material is available in a pamphlet, An Expose of the Practice of the Palace, or Marshalsea Court, written in 1833 by an anonymous eyewitness. Although the first Marshalsea survived for 500 years, and the second for just 38, it is the latter that became widely known, thanks largely to Charles Dickens, whose father, John Dickens, was sent there on 20 February 1824, under the Insolvent Debtor's Act 1813. He owed a baker, James Kerr, ¬£40 and 10 shillings, a sum equivalent to ¬£ in .Allingham 2004. Twelve years old at the time, Dickens was sent to live in lodgings with Mrs. Ellen Roylance in Little College Street, Camden Town, from where he walked five miles (8 km) every day to Warren's blacking factory at 30 Hungerford Stairs, a factory owned by a relative of his mother's. He spent 10 hours a day wrapping bottles of shoe polish for six shillings a week to pay for his keep. His mother, Elizabeth Barrow, and her three youngest children joined her husband in the Marshalsea in April 1824. Dickens would visit them every Sunday until he found lodgings in Lant Street, closer to the prison, in the attic of a house belonging to the vestry clerk of St George's Church. This meant he was able to breakfast with his family in the Marshalsea and dine with them after work. His father was released after three months, on 28 May 1824, but the family's financial situation remained poor and Dickens had to continue working at the factory, something for which he reportedly never forgave his mother. Years later he wrote about the Marshalsea and other debtors' prisons in The Pickwick Papers (1836‚Äì1837), David Copperfield (1849‚Äì1850), and most extensively in Little Dorrit (1855‚Äì1857), whose main character, Amy, is born in the Marshalsea. Trey Philpotts writes that every detail about the Marshalsea in Little Dorrit reflects the real prison of the 1820s. According to Philpotts, Dickens rarely made mistakes and did not exaggerate; if anything, he downplayed the licentiousness of Marshalsea life, perhaps to protect Victorian sensibilities.Philpotts 2003, p. 8. =Debtors= This plan of the second Marshalsea was drawn up in 1842 when it was closed; see clickable version. Like the first Marshalsea, the second was notoriously cramped. In 1827, 414 out of its 630 debtors were there for debts under ¬£20; 1,890 people in Southwark were imprisoned that year for a total debt of ¬£16,442.Wade 1829, p. 124. The debtors' section consisted of a brick barracks, a yard measuring ,Neild 1812, cited in Small 2004, p. 908. a kitchen, a public room, and a tap room or snuggery, where debtors could drink as much beer as they wanted, at fivepence a pot in 1815. Philpotts reports that, by the early 19th century, most debtors spent only months in the prison; on 19 April 1826 it held 105 debtors, 99 of whom had been there for less than six months and the other six for less than a year.Philpotts 2003, p. 102. The barracks was less than 10 yards wide and 33 yards long (9 m √ó 30 m) and was divided into eight houses, each with three floors, containing 56 rooms in all. Each floor had seven rooms facing the front and seven in the back. There were no internal hallways. The rooms were accessed directly from the outside via eight narrow wooden staircases, a fire hazard given that the stairs provided the sole exit and the houses were separated only by thin lathe and plaster partitions. Women debtors were housed in rooms over the tap room. The rooms in the barracks (the men's rooms) were square and high, with a window, wooden floors and a fireplace. Each housed two or three prisoners, and as the rooms were too small for two beds, prisoners had to share.. Apart from the bed, prisoners were expected to provide their own furniture.. The anonymous witness complained in 1833: Much of the prison business was run by a debtors' committee of nine prisoners and a chair (a position held by Dickens' father). Appointed on the last Wednesday of each month, and meeting every Monday at 11 am, the committee was responsible for imposing fines for rules violations, an obligation they met with enthusiasm. Debtors could be fined for theft; throwing water or filth out of windows or into someone else's room; making noise after midnight; cursing, fighting or singing obscene songs; smoking in the beer room from 8‚Äì10 am and 12‚Äì2 pm; defacing the staircase; dirtying the privy seats; stealing newspapers or utensils from the snuggery; urinating in the yard; drawing water before it had boiled; and criticizing the committee.; . As dreadful as the Marshalsea was, it kept the creditors away. Debtors could even arrange to have themselves arrested by a business partner to enter the jail when it suited them. Historian Margot Finn writes that discharge was therefore used as a punishment; one debtor was thrown out in May 1801 for \\"making a Noise and disturbance in the prison\\".Finn 2007, p. 149. =Garnish and chummage= Prison courtyard, c. 1897, when the buildings were being let as rooms and shops. Upon arrival, new prisoners were expected to pay garnish, a donation to the prisoners' committee. When the commissioners reported to parliament between 1815 and 1818, male prisoners were paying five shillings and sixpence, increased to eight shillings and sixpence by the time the anonymous witness was writing in 1833. Women were asked for a smaller sum. The fee allowed prisoners to use the snuggery, where water could be boiled and meals cooked, and candles and newspapers obtained.. Prisoners failing to pay were declared defaulters by the prison crier, had their names written up in the kitchen, and were sent to Coventry.; ; Finn 2007, p. 143. After paying garnish, prisoners were given a \\"chum ticket\\", which told them which room was theirs and which prisoners they would be chumming with. They would often spend the first night in the infirmary until a room could be made ready, and sometimes three or four nights walking around the yard before a chum could be found, although they were already being charged for the room they did not have. According to Dickens specialist Trey Philpotts, the newest arrival was usually placed with the youngest prisoner who was living alone. A wealthier prisoner could pay his roommate to go away‚Äî\\"buy out the chum\\"‚Äîfor half-a-crown a week in 1818, while the outcast chum would sleep in the tap room or find another room to rent in the prison. The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were debtors who had declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14 days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor side of the building, near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from the county and money from charity.Dickens, The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, p. 628. =Admiralty prisoners= The Admiralty division housed a few prisoners under naval courts-martial for mutiny, desertion, piracy, and what the deputy marshal preferred in 1815 to call \\"unnatural crimes\\", a euphemism for sex between men. Unlike other parts of the prison that had been built from scratch in 1811, the Admiralty division‚Äîas well as the northern boundary wall, the dayroom and the chapel‚Äîhad been part of the old Borough gaol and were considerably run down. The cells were so rotten they were barely able to confine the prisoners; in 1817 one actually broke through his cell walls. The low boundary wall meant that Admiralty prisoners were often chained to bolts fixed to the floor in the infirmary.Philpotts 2003, pp. 92‚Äì94; Philpotts 1991. They were supposed to have a separate yard to exercise in, so that criminals were not mixing with debtors, but in fact the prisoners mixed often and happily, according to Dickens.Dickens, Little Dorrit, p. 61. The parliamentary committee deplored this practice, arguing that Admiralty prisoners were characterized by an \\"entire absence of all control\\", and were bound to have a bad effect on the debtors.Philpotts 2003, p. 95. The two groups would retreat to their own sections during inspections, Dickens wrote: > [T]he smugglers habitually consorted with the debtors ... except at certain > constitutional moments when somebody came from some Office, to go through > some form of overlooking something, which neither he nor anybody else knew > anything about. On those truly British occasions, the smugglers, if any, > made a feint of walking into the strong cells and the blind alley, while > this somebody pretended to do his something; and made a reality of walking > out again as soon as he hadn't done it‚Äîneatly epitomizing the administration > of most of the public affairs, in our right little, tight little > island.Dickens, Little Dorrit, p. 64. =Women= Painting of the Marshalsea in the early 1900s, after it had closed, by American artist Francis Hopkinson Smith. It was probably created when the artist visited London in 1913. According to the anonymous eyewitness, women in the Marshalsea were in constant moral danger: \\"How often has female virtue been assailed in poverty? Alas how often has it fallen, in consequence of a husband or a father having been a prisoner for debt?\\" The prison doctor would visit every other day to attend to prisoners, and sometimes their children‚Äîto \\"protect his reputation\\", according to a doctor testifying in 1815 to a parliamentary commission‚Äîbut would not attend to their wives. This left women to give birth alone or with the help of other prisoners. The doctor told the commission he had helped just once with a birth, and then only as a matter of courtesy, because it was not included in his salary.Philpotts 2003, p. 100. The presence of wives, lovers and daughters was taken for granted. Visitors could come and go freely, and even live with the prisoners, without being asked who they were. Female prisoners were allowed to mix with the men. Some of the rooms were let to prostitutes. The prison gates were closed from ten at night until eight the next morning, with a bell warning visitors half an hour before closing time, and an officer walking around the prison calling, \\"Strangers, women and children all out!\\" =Closure and abolition= The Marshalsea was closed by an Act of Parliament in 1842, and on 19 November that year the inmates were relocated to the Bethlem hospital if they were mentally ill, or to the King's Bench Prison, at that point renamed the Queen's Prison. On 31 December 1849 the Court of the Marshalsea of the Household of the Kings of England was abolished, and its power transferred to Her Majesty's Court of Common Pleas at Westminster.The Jurist, 3(2), 1850, p. 359. The buildings and land were auctioned off in July 1843 and purchased for ¬£5,100 by W. G. Hicks, an ironmonger. The property consisted of the keeper's house, the canteen (known as a suttling house), the Admiralty section, the chapel, a three-storey brick building and eight brick houses, all closed off from Borough High Street by iron gates. Imprisonment for debt was finally outlawed in England in 1869, except in cases of fraud or refusal to pay, and in the 1870s the Home Office demolished most of the prison buildings, though in 1955 parts of it were still in use by George Harding & Sons, hardware merchants.Darlington 1955. Dickens visited what was left of the Marshalsea in May 1857, just before he finished Little Dorrit. He wrote in the preface: > Some of my readers may have an interest in being informed whether or no any > portions of the Marshalsea Prison are yet standing. I did not know, myself, > until the sixth of this present month, when I went to look. I found the > outer front courtyard, often mentioned in this story, metamorphosed into a > butter shop; and then I almost gave up every brick of the jail for lost. > Wandering, however, down a certain adjacent \\"Angel Court, leading to > Bermondsey\\", I came to \\"Marshalsea Place\\": the houses in which I recognised, > not only as the great block of the former prison, but as preserving the > rooms that arose in my mind's eye when I became Little Dorrit's biographer > ... A little further on, I found the older and smaller wall, which used to > enclose the pent-up inner prison where nobody was put, except for ceremony. > But, whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, > leading to Bermondsey, will find his feet on the very paving-stones of the > extinct Marshalsea jail; will see its narrow yard to the right and to the > left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when > the place got free; will look upon the rooms in which the debtors lived; and > will stand among the crowding ghosts of many miserable years.Dickens, Little > Dorrit, pp. vi‚Äìvii. =Location of prison remains= Remaining wall of the Marshalsea, 2007. The wall marked the prison's southern boundary. The building on the site of the prison houses Southwark Council's John Harvard Library and Local Studies Library, at 211 Borough High Street, just north of the junction with Tabard Street. All that remains of the Marshalsea is the brick wall that marked the southern boundary of the prison, separating it from St George's churchyard, now a small garden. It can be reached by underground on the Northern line to Borough tube station, or by train to London Bridge station. The surviving wall runs along an alleyway that was part of the prison, now called Angel Place. The name Angel Place has led to confusion because there were two alleyways on the north side of the Marshalsea (Angel Court and Angel Alley), the first of which Dickens refers to when giving directions to the prison remains in 1857. See Richard Horwood's 18th-century map, which shows Angel Court/Angel Alley near the Borough Goal , marked by the number 2. The wall is marked on the garden side, on what would have been the external wall of the prison, by a plaque from the local council. There is also a paving stone with information about Dickens's father. The Cuming Museum has one of the prison's pumps and the Dickens House Museum one of its windows.\\"Marshalsea\\", London Footprints.

He was elected as the Politician of the Year 2006 by readers of the Burma Digest.by Burma Digest He has led a campaign for a signature petition to release all political prisoners when most of the political leaders were imprisoned by the Myanmar Military Junta, SPDC, in order to silence their opposition. He took over all responsibilities after Min Ko Naing, Pyone Cho, Min Za Ya, Htay Kywe and Ko Ko Gyi were arrested.  Background  Mya Aye is one of the leaders of 88 generation students group led by Min Ko Naing. He was first arrested in 1989 and sentenced for 8 years imprisonment because of his role as a prominent student leader in 1988 uprising. He was released in 1996 and still continued campaigning for democracy in Burma. He strongly believes in human rights and freedom. He was arrested again 2007 with fellow students leaders and sentenced for 65 years and 6 months imprisonment. His daughter Wai Hnin Pwint Thon has followed his footsteps to bring change in Burma. She has campaigned for the release of political prisoners in Burma and freedom and democracy. Wai Hnin Pwint Thon based in London and studying her degree at university.  Background of the uprising  On 27 June 2006 - the 18th anniversary of the founding of the National League for Democracy - the leaders of the opposition movement were arrested. On 2 October the remaining 88 Generation Students' group started the first-ever public campaign against the SPDC and gathered signatures for a petition calling for the release of political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. More than half a million people signed the petition despite being harassed by SPDC Kyant Phuts and their thugs. The signatures were later presented to the UN. Following this they organized a \\"White Expression\\" campaign and requested that people wear white clothes to protest against the SPDC. It was continued until the 44th birthday of Min Ko Naing on 18 October. On 29 October, they started a third campaign called the \\"Multi Religious Prayer Campaign\\" and requested that people again wear white clothing and hold candlelight vigils and prayers in temples, churches and mosques. On 22 August 2007, a rare public protest over a sharp rise in fuel prices led to a wave of arrests by the Burmese junta. Those arrested included the senior leaders of the 88 Generation Students' group as well as members of other student and civil advocacy groups. Hundreds of demonstrators had taken to the streets to express their anger at the surprise increase in fuel prices. Natural gas prices have risen 500% and petrol and diesel prices have almost doubled, according to The Guardian. The rise has hit poor labourers particularly hard, swallowing up to half of their daily income.  The 88 Generation Students' group involvement  The 88 Generation Students Group is an organisation synonymous with the long struggle for democracy in military-ruled Burma and take their name from the 1988 student-led uprising and People's Democracy Movement, which was eventually suppressed by the military. In a rare announcement in all state-run newspapers, the junta said that the dissidents were arrested for undermining the peace and security of the state, according to The Epoch Times. Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Mya Aye, Pyone Cho, Jimmy and Yin Htun were among those from the 88 Generation Student group arrested. On 21 August 2007, 14 student leaders of the 88 Student Generation of Democracy were arrested. The 14 members are Paw U Tun (also known as Min Ko Naing), Ko Ko Gyi, Pyone Cho (also known as Htay Win Aung), Min Zeyar, Mya Aye, Jimmy (Kyaw Min Yu), Zeya, Ant Bwe Kyaw, Kyaw Kyaw Htwe (Marki), Panneik Tun, Zaw Zaw Min, Thet Zaw, Nyan Lin Tun and Ko Yin Htun. They were arrested by security officials and members of the state-backed Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA). \\"Military intelligence and government intelligence seized their houses and searched their houses,‚Äù told another dissident, Htay Kywe, who escaped and fled to neighbouring Thailand. Despite the arrests, reports from Burma said that campaigners took to the streets again the following day to protest against the government‚Äôs recent increase in fuel prices.

CDX1 is expressed in the developing endoderm and its expression persists in the intestine throughout adulthood. CDX1 protein expression varies along the intestine, with high expression in intestinal crypts and diminishing expression along intestinal villi.  Function  This gene is a member of the caudal-related homeobox transcription factor family. The encoded DNA-binding protein regulates intestine-specific gene expression and enterocyte differentiation. It has been shown to induce expression of the intestinal alkaline phosphatase gene, and inhibit beta-catenin/T-cell factor transcriptional activity. CDX1 has also been shown to play an important role in embryonic epicardial development. It has been demonstrated that CDX proteins suppress cardiac differentiation in both zebrafish and mouse embryonic stem cells, but the overall mechanism for how this happens is poorly understood. However, CDX1 has been shown to be transiently expressed in the embryonic heart 11.5 days post coitum (dpc). This transient expression is thought to induce epicardial epithelial-to-mesynchemal transition and thus proper cardiovascular formation. It has been shown that low-dose CDX1 induction caused enhanced migration and differentiation of epicardium-derived cells into vascular smooth muscle, where as continued high dose induction of CDX1 or CDX1 deficiency diminished the ability of these cells to migrate and differentiate into smooth muscle by the actions of TGF-Œ≤1. Furthermore, CDX1 induction also altered transcript expression of genes related to cell adhesions for EMT and angiogenesis. Therefore, along with its known roles in intestinal patterning and differentiation, CDX1 is also shown to be important in epicardial development.

A total of 429 of these locomotives were built at the PRR's Juniata Shops, spread across five subclasses; some had diameter driving wheels for service in level territory, while others had drivers for mountainous terrain. In the pre-1895 scheme, these locomotives were second class L. Construction continued until 1910, and the locomotives, aided by a rebuild program from 1914, remained in service in large numbers until the 1930s, a small number surviving into the 1940s. One locomotive, #1223, was preserved and is currently on display. Design These locomotives were originally conceived as an enlargement of the earlier class P (later reclassified D14) and were an extremely large and powerful locomotive for the period. Breaking with the traditional 4-4-0 layout with a low-slung boiler and the firebox between the frames, the class L design had a large Belpaire firebox above the frames and a large high-mounted boiler. The high center of gravity proved to offer an exceptional high-speed ride. The design was the product of three men; general superintendent of motive power Frank D. Casaneve, chief mechanical engineer Axel S. Vogt, and chief of motive power Theodore N. Ely, Casaneve supervising the overall design, Vogt perfecting the mechanical details and Ely paying more attention to the appearance and external detail. Two versions were conceived, reflecting the variety of terrain the PRR traversed; a high-drivered version for flat terrain with wheels and a low-drivered version for hilly terrain with wheels. The versions had tractive effort ratings of and , respectively. In the reclassification of 1895, the 68-inch drivered locomotives became class D16 and the 80-inch became D16a. Production 73 of the high-drivered D16a subclass were built between 1895‚Äì1898, and 6 of class D16 in 1896. A slightly revised low-drivered subclass D16b was constructed to the tune of 262 examples between 1900‚Äì1908, as well as 12 high-drivered D16c in 1900 and 45 high-drivered D16d between 1900‚Äì1910. As the American (4-4-0) type was displaced from top-flight service to secondary duties, tractive effort became more important than top speed. Large numbers of the high-drivered locomotives were converted to low-drivered; 76 D16a and D16c were converted to subclass D16, while 9 of class D16d were converted to D16b specification; this left only a small number of locomotives with 80-inch drivers. Rebuilds In 1914, the PRR experimentally rebuilt D16b #178 in the Altoona Shops, giving it a superheater for greater power and efficiency. This necessitated replacing the slide-valve equipped cylinders, the lubrication of which was incompatible with the hotter, dryer superheated steam, with piston valves and slightly larger cylinders. Steam pressure was reduced by to . Tractive effort increased to from . The rebuilt locomotive was classified D16sb, the \\"s\\" referring to superheat. The conversion proving a success, over the next few years 241 locomotives of various D16 sub-classes were converted to D16sb configuration, with 68-inch drivers. In addition, a number of high-drivered locomotives were rebuilt; these were classified D16sd. Later career Even by the early 1900s the 4-4-0 type was becoming eclipsed by larger types such as 4-4-2 \\"Atlantics\\" in top-flight service, and the D16 locomotives became stalwarts on more pedestrian services; slower trains, locals, branch line service, and commuter services. The rebuilds to D16sb and D16sd gave them a new lease of life in such service, and even by December 1929 there were still 143 examples in operation, mostly in the Eastern and Central Regions. A number were sold to the small Kishacoquillas Valley Railroad in Belleville, Pennsylvania, and the quantities in service with the PRR dwindled progressively as train lengths increased and newer locomotives trickled down, especially with the reduced traffic of Depression years and with steam locomotives made surplus by the railroad's electrification projects. Last survivors The last of the PRR's American types were found on the branch lines of the Delmarva Division, on the Delmarva Peninsula, encompassing parts of the U.S. states of Maryland, Delaware and Virginia. Three locomotives were left at the beginning of World War II, numbers 1035, 1223 and 5079; of these, only 1223 retained its slatted passenger pilot. This locomotive, a 1905 product of the Juniata Shops, was selected by the railroad for preservation as a historic artifact and was stored at Wilmington, Delaware until 1951, following which it was placed in the PRR's historic collection in the roundhouse at Northumberland, Pennsylvania. In 1953, the last of the D16s were retired. Strasburg Railroad In 1960, the 1223 was leased and transferred to the Strasburg Rail Road, a tourist line in the Amish hamlet of Strasburg, Pennsylvania, where it was returned to operating condition. It operated tourist trains there until 1989, successively leased by the PRR, its successor Penn Central from 1968, and the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania from 1979. While in operation, it had Strasburg Railroad lettering on both cab sides below the number.

Structure  FGL2 is a 439 amino acid secreted protein that is similar to the Œ≤- and Œ≥-chains of fibrinogen. The carboxyl- terminus of the encoded protein consists of the fibrinogen-related domains (FRED). The encoded protein forms a tetrameric complex which is stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds.  Function  This protein may play a role in physiologic functions at mucosal sites. FGL2 is a protein that exhibits pleiotropic effects within the body and is an important immune regulator of both innate and adaptive responses. The protein exists as both a Type II transmembrane protein (with the carboxy terminus on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane) found on the surface of macrophages and endothelial cells and can be constitutively secreted by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  Variants  = Membrane bound = Membrane bound FGL2 (mFGL2) exhibits a prothrombinase activity, resulting in fibrin deposition, vascular thrombosis and tissue inflammation within an affected tissue, largely contributing to the innate arm of immunity. Through mFGL2‚Äôs actions of promoting vascular thrombosis and tissue inflammation, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of viral-induced fulminant hepatitis in acute hepatitis B infections. Hepatocellular necrosis ensues rapidly, due to the HBV nucleocapsid protein‚Äôs ability to markedly upregulate expression of the mFGL2 prothrombinase, leading to fibrin deposition within the vasculature networks that supply blood to the liver. = Secreted = In addition to its constitutive secretion by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the secreted form of FGL2 (sFGL2) can be inducibly secreted by Foxp3+ CD4+ CD25+ T regulatory cells (Tregs). Such Treg cells play a vital role in dampening the immune response after the clearance of an infection to prevent sterile inflammation. These cells also play a fundamental role in maintaining self tolerance by suppressing the activation and expansion of self-reactive lymphocytes that may instigate autoimmunity.9 Through their roles in immune homeostasis, it has been shown that depletion of the Treg cell population in murine models for disease lead to enhanced immune responses to a variety of infectious agents including hepatitis C virus (HCV).10 Additionally, patients with a chronic HCV infection were shown to have higher counts of Treg cells in peripheral blood when compared with successfully treated or healthy controls.11 Secreted FGL2 (sFGL2) plays a role as a negative regulator of the Immune response. sFGL2 inhibits the adaptive immune response. Knockout mice for FGL2 have T cells that are hyperproliferative. sFGL2 is capable of inhibiting the proliferation of T cells stimulated by alloantigens and this inhibition is alleviated by the addition of a monoclonal antibody against sFGL2‚Äôs fibrinogen-like domain (FRED).12 When the supernatants of these T cell cultures are analyzed, they showed a predominant Th2 type polarization with upregulated levels of expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10).12 There are also downregulated levels of Th1-type cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥). This shows that sFGL2 largely inhibits the Th1 type response needed to activate cytotoxic lymphocytes to clear HCV infections. Additionally, sFGL2 can inhibit the maturation of immature dendritic cells (DCs) by preventing NF-Œ∫B translocation to the nucleus and subsequent expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II). Therefore, sFGL2 may contribute to the negative regulatory activity exhibited by Treg cells. sFGL2 works to repress immune response through its FRED Domain. The immunosuppressive activity of sFGL2 has been localized to the C-terminal region containing the FRED domain. sFGL2‚Äôs FRED domain shares significant homology to the fibrinogen related domains of potent immunoregulatory molecules like cytotaxin and tenascin.12 This works to repress immune responses by binding to the inhibitory FC receptor, FCŒ≥RIIB. Furthermore, HCV‚Äôs core protein has been found to increase the levels of expression of sFGL2 and cause virus-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes to skew largely toward a Th2 lineage, allowing for the establishment of a chronic infection.13  Clinical significance  Human Fibrinogen-like protein 2 may be useful as a biomarker for responsiveness to antiviral therapy.

Plot The film opens in Los Angeles, where Doug Blake (Jack Carson) is dumped as a manager by Gary Mitchell (Lee Bowman). He goes to New York City to find a new singer to replace Gary on the Hour of Enchantment radio show. While in New York, he discovers Martha Gibson (Doris Day) turning records in a jukebox factory. He takes her to Los Angeles and tries to introduce her to Felix Hofer (S. Z. Sakall). His efforts lead to a series of communication failures. Meanwhile, Martha has begun to fall in love with Gary. Doug takes her to a party at Gary's house where Gary gets drunk and is unable to sing on his radio program. Martha replaces him and becomes successful. Gary, whose ego has driven away all of the people who once helped him, cannot find anyone who will hire or even represent him. Knowing how Martha feels about Gary, Doug helps him come back, but Gary goes back to his old ways and drives Martha away. Martha then realizes that she really loves Doug and makes up with him.

Production The film serves as a remake of Twenty Million Sweethearts (1934), in which the aspiring singer was male.Tucker (2012), p. 107-109 The film Swing Hostess (1944) also had a similar plot, in which aspiring singer Judy Alvin (Martha Tilton) is spinning records in a jukebox factory, and her roommate and friend Marge (Irish Adrian) tries to help her start her career. Eve Arden has a key supporting role as Vivian \\"Vi\\" Martin, Doug Blake's co-worker in the radio show The Hour of Enchantment. She is depicted as a highly competent professional woman. She at first agrees to financially support Doug in exchange for half his business earnings. She then allows Martha and her son Freddie to move in with her. When more is needed to finance Martha's career, Vivian has to sell her own mink coat. The film features a love triangle among Doug Blake, Martha Gibson, and Gary Mitchell. Vivian Martin has her own romantic subplot with Thomas Hutchins, though it is limited to a few suggestive glances. This was the third and last time that Arden co-worked with Adolphe Menjou. According to gossip columnist Sheilah Graham, Day missed three days of shooting in May 1948, due to being sick with a fever. The film features the final, feature film appearance of comic actor Edgar Kennedy, who died on November 9, 1948. The film is perhaps best remembered today for an extended dream sequence combining animation and live action which featured a cameo appearance by Bugs Bunny, dancing with Jack Carson and Doris Day to the tune of Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, as well as an appearance by Tweety, which was a favorite of animation director Friz Freleng. The sequence has an Easter theme and features the actors in bunny suits. Reception =Box Office= According to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,994,000 domestically and $748,000 foreign. =Critical= Time magazine's review was not favorable, finding that the film merely reused elements from older films. \\"It has all been done before‚Äîfrequently much better\\". It did, however, find some positive aspects of the film. One was Doris Day's singing, another the caustic lines of Eve Arden. John L. Scot, reviewer for the Los Angeles Times, found the basic story trite. But also praised the charm of Doris Day and her ability to sell a tune, while also favoring the comedy performance of Eve Arden. Richard L. Coe, reviewer of The Washington Post, called the film a \\"supremely dull achievement\\". He found Arden's character wittier and more human than that of Doris Day. Tom Santopietro, in a retrospective of the film, credits Arden with the best performance of the film, praising her comic timing.

He was named an honorable mention All-America by USA Today, 1st Team All-State as a Safety, and honorable mention All-State as quarterback for the Vikings. Meeuwsen was also 3rd Team All-State in Basketball and 1st Team All-State in Baseball. He was the Pacific-8 Conference Player of the Year in all three sports. He is a 2000 graduate of Forest Grove High School. College career Meeuwsen played for the Oregon State Beavers. He played for the Beavers from 2000 through 2004. In his time at OSU, he finished with 217 tackles, 29 passes defensed, 10.5 tackles for loss, one sack, five fumble recoveries and one forced fumble. He also set a school record of 20 career interceptions beating the 1964 record of 15 by Dan Espalin. In his first start as a red shirt freshman against UCLA, Meeuwsen recorded 10 tackles, a sack, a forced fumble, and recovered a fumble while being named ABC Player of the Game. He would go on to be named Freshman All-American. In his junior season, he intercepted six passes. In his senior season, he was chosen as a First-team All-Pac-10 selection after leading team with six interceptions and a 2004 ESPN.com All- America selection. He graduated with a degree in Geography from Oregon State. NFL career Upon graduating from Oregon State, Meeuwsen signed with the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted rookie on April 29, 2005. The Dolphins waived him on May 12, 2005. Meeuwsen signed a one-year contract with the San Diego Chargers on January 10, 2006. He was allocated by the San Diego Chargers to Rhein Fire of NFL Europe for 2006 season. He played in all 10 games recording 25 tackles, two sacks, a forced fumble and a pass deflection. After returning from the NFL Europe season Meeuwsen rejoined the Chargers through training camp and was released during final roster cuts after the pre-season.  Life after football  Meeuwsen has spent time racing dwarf cars with the Pacific Hardtop Racing Association, racing at tracks in Oregon, Washington and California. He won a non-points main event at Coos Bay Speedway in Coos Bay, Oregon on July 4, 2008. Meeuwsen, known for his level headiness, positive attitude and being easy going, has become one of the most well liked and most respected members of the club. His breakthrough in a points race came in the 2009 season finale for the PHRA at Willamette Speedway in Lebanon, Oregon as he passed longtime successful dwarf car racer Kelly Gutches in the closing laps to win on October 3. The win was very popular within the PHRA club membership. Meeuwsen also briefly attended graduate school at Pacific University in Forest Grove before taking a job at UPS. Meeuwsen worked as a driver at UPS for 3 years before becoming a graduate assistant football coach at Oregon State.  Current  Meeuwsen accepted a position in January 2011 at his college Alma mater, Oregon State University, as a graduate assistant coach for the football team he was an All-Pac 10 player for. The position of graduate assistant is a way for young coaches to break into the business of coaching college football and learn the many skills needed in the profession. Meeuwsen is working for the same coaches he played for while at Oregon State. \\"Mitch Meeuwsen, who worked with the safeties, assisting secondary coach Rod Perry, moved to San Diego and is pursuing a career outside of football\\" [1] Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Oregon State Beavers football players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Sportspeople from Hillsboro, Oregon Category:People from Forest Grove, Oregon Category:Rhein Fire players Category:Oregon State Beavers football coaches ","title":"Mitch Meeuwsen"},{"id":"14876678","text":"Collagen alpha-1(XIII) chain is a protein that in humans is encoded by the COL13A1 gene.

During the 19th to early 20th century Bandung has become a popular business, shopping and leisure destination for wealthy plantation owners, in particular in the weekends. As a result, the hotel business was blooming in the city. The predecessor of the present hotel, the Homann Hotel was built in 1871‚Äì72, owned and managed by the Homann family. It was famous for its delicious Mrs. Homann's Rijsttafel. This first small building was designed in Gothic-Romantic style. In 1939, the hotel was rebuilt in a curved streamlined art deco style, designed by the architect Albert Aalbers. To emphasize its grandeur and luxury the name \\"Savoy\\" was added in the 1940s, which remained unchanged until the 1980s. Some of its celebrity guests during the Dutch East Indies era were Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford. Interior of the hotel in the 1950s During the World War II Japanese occupation (1942‚Äì45), the hotel functioned as luxurious barracks for Japanese soldiers. In 1955, when the first Asian‚ÄìAfrican Conference was held in Bandung, Savoy Homann hosted VVIP guests and became a part of the Historical Walk. Some of the guests were Sukarno, Ho Chi Minh, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, U Nu, Zhou Enlai, Gamal Abdul Nasser, and Tito. In the 1990s the hotel was renovated and a new wing was added. Today the hotel was bought under the management of Bidakara Group, thus the name changed to Savoy Homann Bidakara Hotel.

He is currently Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology and Associate Dean of Graduate Medical Education in California Northstate University College of Medicine. Early life James Martel received a Bachelor of Science degree from Stanford University; a Doctor of Medicine from Harvard Medical School; a Masters in Public Health in the area of Epidemiology and Biostatistics from the Harvard School of Public Health and received his surgical subspecialty training in ophthalmology from Johns Hopkins Medical School and Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute. In the early 1980s, while at Harvard Medical School, Howe Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, he was among the first investigators to apply NMR spectroscopy to study tissue metabolism non-destructively. The research was able to demonstrate the conversion of glucose to sorbitol in the single intact lens which supported the hypothesis that sorbitol led tissue damage in diabetes. The condition of diabetes leads to uncontrolled levels of glucose in the body. The ability to monitor glucose and its metabolism in by non-invasive methodology in living tissue allows facilitated the understanding of this disease state. His research on the living lens was used to understand diabetic cataract formation. During this time, in collaboration with Dr. Leo Chylack, Jr., he demonstrated the statistical correlation between diabetes and posterior subcapsular cataracts. For this specific work, he was awarded the Soma Weiss Award from Harvard Medical School. Aguayo Martel further probed the association of human behavior and cataract formation using non-linear regression analysis. Career After finishing his internship at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, he moved to Baltimore where at Johns Hopkins medical institutions, Dr. Martel led a research team as the Associate Director of NMR Research, which developed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Microscopy, a technique for non-invasively obtaining microscopic three-dimensional images of living objects. The technique first applied to a single living cell signaled the advent of a new class of instruments which would eventually allow monitoring cellular structures and their biochemistry inside the human body, or to perform \\"biopsies\\" without needles or surgery.Davis, Lisa (July 19, 1986). Seeing the cell and letting it live Science News at thefreelibrary.com. Retrieved 2012-03-24. He applied his MR microscopy to the study of ocular tissues and tumors and used histological correlation to refine his technique. Dr. Martel was the first to study the biophysical properties of vitreous using NMR spectroscopy and imaging. After the analysis of this ocular structure, he extended his research into the area of vitreous hemorrhage (bleeding into the eye), an area of great importance in loss of sight. During this time period he explored the use of three dimensional computerized tomography (CT) for the localization and compositional evaluation of intraocular and orbital foreign bodies. He pioneered the technique of deuterium NMR spectroscopy to study metabolism in biological systems. This technique extended the capabilities of existing NMR spectroscopy techniques used to investigate tissue metabolism. Dr. Martel applied his technique to the understanding of diabetic cataract formation and corneal metabolism in order to create new and improved methods of tissue preservation for improved tissue transplantation. He developed a novel method for monitoring activity in multiple metabolic pathways (hexose monophosphate shunt, glycolysis, and the polyol pathway) in the single living lens which allowed insight into the study of diabetic cataractogenesis. and applied to corneal tissue transplantation. His work culminated in the development of chemical shift NMR Microscopy, which combined Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy analysis while working at the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research team applied the technique to the study of the living lens to study diabetic cataractogenesis. In 1987, Dr. Aguayo Martel was an invited lecturer at the American Physical Society; the Symposium of the Committee on Applications of Physics: Microtomography-New Three Dimensional Microscopy and presented Grand Rounds at the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health on \\"A New Model of Diabetic Cataractogenesis.\\" The understanding of the metabolism of glucose into sorbitol in the diabetic state has led to the development of a class of medications (aldose reductase inhibitor) to prevent eye and nerve damage in people with diabetes.

It emphasizes strategic, tactical, and sometimes logistical challenges. Many games also offer economic challenges and exploration. They are generally categorized into four sub-types, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time, and whether the game focuses on strategy or tactics.  Definition  Strategy video games are a genre of video game that emphasize skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory. Specifically, a player must plan a series of actions against one or more opponents, and the reduction of enemy forces is usually a goal. Victory is achieved through superior planning, and the element of chance takes a smaller role. In most strategy video games, the player is given a godlike view of the game world, and indirectly controls game units under their command. Thus, most strategy games involve elements of warfare to varying degrees, and feature a combination of tactical and strategic considerations. In addition to combat, these games often challenge the player's ability to explore, or manage an economy. = Relationship to other genres = Even though there are many action games that involve strategic thinking, they are seldom classified as strategy games. A strategy game is typically larger in scope, and their main emphasis is on the player's ability to outthink their opponent. Strategy games rarely involve a physical challenge, and tend to annoy strategically minded players when they do. Compared to other genres such as action or adventure games where one player takes on many enemies, strategy games usually involve some level of symmetry between sides. Each side generally has access to similar resources and actions, with the strengths and weaknesses of each side being generally balanced. Although strategy games involve strategic, tactical, and sometimes logistical challenges, they are distinct from puzzle games. A strategy game calls for planning around a conflict between players, whereas puzzle games call for planning in isolation. Strategy games are also distinct from construction and management simulations, which include economic challenges without any fighting. These games may incorporate some amount of conflict, but are different from strategy games because they do not emphasize the need for direct action upon an opponent. Although strategy games are similar to role-playing video games in that the player must manage units with a variety of numeric attributes, RPGs tend to be about a smaller number of unique characters, while strategy games focus on larger numbers of fairly similar units. Game design = Units and conflict = Strategy games give players indirect control over many units in a battlefield. Many games, for example Globulation 2, include other challenges such as building construction. The player commands their forces by selecting a unit, usually by clicking it with the mouse, and issuing an order from a menu. Keyboard shortcuts become important for advanced players, as speed is often an important factor. Units can typically move, attack, stop, hold a position, although other strategy games offer more complex orders. Units may even have specialized abilities, such as the ability to become invisible to other units, usually balanced with abilities that detect otherwise invisible things. Some strategy games even offer special leader units that provide a bonus to other units. Units may also have the ability to sail or fly over otherwise impassable terrain, or provide transport for other units. Non-combat abilities often include the ability to repair or construct other units or buildings. Even in imaginary or fantastic conflicts, strategy games try to reproduce important tactical situations throughout history. Techniques such as flanking, making diversions, or cutting supply lines may become integral parts of managing combat. Terrain becomes an important part of strategy, since units may gain or lose advantages based on the landscape. Some strategy games such as Civilization III and Medieval 2: Total War involve other forms of conflict such as diplomacy and espionage. However, warfare is the most common form of conflict, as game designers have found it difficult to make non-violent forms of conflict as appealing. = Economy, resources and upgrades = Strategy games often involve other economic challenges. These can include building construction, population maintenance, and resource management. Strategy games frequently make use of a windowed interface to manage these complex challenges. Most strategy games allow players to accumulate resources which can be converted to units, or converted to buildings such as factories that produce more units. The quantity and types of resources vary from game to game. Some games will emphasize resource acquisition by scattering large quantities throughout the map, while other games will put more emphasis on how resources are managed and applied by balancing the availability of resources between players. To a lesser extent, some strategy games give players a fixed quantity of units at the start of the game. Strategy games often allow the player to spend resources on upgrades or research. Some of these upgrades enhance the player's entire economy. Other upgrades apply to a unit or class of units, and unlock or enhance certain combat abilities. Sometimes enhancements are enabled by building a structure that enables more advanced structures. Games with a large number of upgrades often feature a technology tree, which is a series of advancements that players can research to unlock new units, buildings, and other capabilities. Technology trees are quite large in some games, and 4X strategy games are known for having the largest. A build order is a linear pattern of production, research, and resource management aimed at achieving a specific and specialized goal. They are analogous to chess openings, in that a player will have a specific order of play in mind, however the amount the build order, the strategy around which the build order is built or even which build order is then used varies on the skill, ability and other factors such as how aggressive or defensive each player is. = Map and exploration = Early strategy games featured a top-down perspective, similar in nature to a board game or paper map. Many later games adopted an isometric perspective. Even with the rise of 3D graphics and the potential to manipulate the camera, games usually feature some kind of aerial view. Very rarely do strategy games show the world from the perspective from an avatar on the ground. This is to provide the player with a big picture view of the game world, and form more effective strategies. Exploration is a key element in most strategy games. The landscape is often shrouded in darkness, and this darkness is lifted as a player's units enters the area. The ability to explore may be inhibited by different kinds of terrain, such as hills, water, or other obstructions. Even after an area is explored, that area may become dim if the player does not patrol it. This design technique is called the fog of war, where the player can see the terrain but not the units within the explored area. This makes it possible for enemies to attack unexpectedly from otherwise explored areas. = Real-time versus turn-based = Bos Wars is a real-time strategy game, where events unfold continuously. Strategy video games are categorized based on whether they offer the continuous gameplay of real-time strategy, or the discrete phases of turn-based strategy. These differences in time-keeping lead to several other differences. Typically, turn-based strategy games have stronger artificial intelligence than real-time strategy games, since the turn-based pace allows more time for complex calculations. But a real-time artificial intelligence makes up for this disadvantage with its ability to manage multiple units more quickly than a human. Overall, real-time strategy games are more action-oriented, as opposed to the abstract planning emphasized in turn-based strategy. The relative popularity of real-time strategy has led some critics to conclude that more gamers prefer action-oriented games. Fans of real-time strategy have criticized the wait times associated with turn- based games, and praised the challenge and realism associated with making quick decisions in real-time. In contrast, turn-based strategy fans have criticized real-time strategy games because most units do not behave appropriately without orders, and thus a turn-based pace allows players to input more realistic and detailed plans. Game theorists have noted that strategic thinking does not lend itself well to real-time action, and turn- based strategy purists have criticized real-time strategy games for replacing \\"true strategy\\" with gameplay that rewards \\"rapid mouse-clicking\\". Overall, reviewers have been able to recognize the advantages associated with both of the main types of strategy games. = Strategy versus tactics = Most strategy video games involve a mix of both strategy and tactics. \\"Tactics\\" usually refer to how troops are utilized in a given battle, whereas \\"strategy\\" describes the mix of troops, the location of the battle, and the commander's larger goals or military doctrine. However, there is also a growing subgenre of purely tactical games, which are referred to as real-time tactics, and turn-based tactics. Game reviewers and scholars sometimes debate whether they are using terminology such as \\"tactics\\" or \\"strategy\\" appropriately. Chris Taylor, the designer of Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, has gone so far as to suggest that real-time strategy titles are more about tactics than strategy. But releases that are considered pure tactical games usually provide players with a fixed set of units, and downplay other strategic considerations such as manufacturing, and resource management. Tactical games are strictly about combat, and typically focus on individual battles, or other small sections in a larger conflict. = Settings and themes = Strategy games can take place in a number of settings. Depending on the theatre of warfare, releases may be noted as naval strategy games, or space strategy games. A title may be noted for its grand strategic scale, whether the game is real- time, or turn-based. Strategy games also draw on a number of historical periods, including World War II, the medieval era, or the Napoleonic era. Some strategy games are even based in an alternate history, by manipulating and rewriting certain historical facts. It is also common to see games based in science fiction or futuristic settings, as well as fantasy settings. Some strategy games are abstract, and do not try to represent a world with high fidelity. Although many of these may still involve combat in the sense that units can capture or destroy each other, these games sometimes offer non- combat challenges such as arranging units in specific patterns. However, the vast majority of computerized strategy games are representational, with more complex game mechanics. = Single player, multiplayer, and massively multiplayer = Strategy games include single-player gameplay, multiplayer gameplay, or both. Single player games will sometimes feature a campaign mode, which involves a series of matches against several artificial intelligence opponents. Finishing each match or mission will advance the game's plot, often with cut scenes, and some games will reward a completed mission with new abilities or upgrades. Hardcore strategy gamers tend to prefer multiplayer competition, where human opponents provide more challenging competition than the artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence opponents often need hidden information or bonuses to provide a challenge to players. More recently, massively multiplayer online strategy games have appeared such as Shattered Galaxy from 2001. However, these games are relatively difficult to design and implement compared to other massively multiplayer online games, as the numerous player-controlled units create a larger volume of online data. By 2006, reviewers expressed disappointment with the titles produced thus far. Critics argued that strategy games are not conducive to massively multiplayer gameplay. A single victory cannot have much impact in a large persistent world, and this makes it hard for a player to care about a small victory, especially if they are fighting for a faction that is losing an overall war. However, more recent developers have tried to learn from past mistakes, resulting in Dreamlords from 2007, and Saga from 2008. In 2012, Supercell released Clash of Clans, a mobile strategy video game. History The origin of strategy video games is rooted in traditional tabletop strategy games like Chess and Go, as well as board and miniature wargaming. The first console strategy game was a Risk-like game called Invasion, released in 1972 for the Magnavox Odyssey. Strategic Simulations (SSI)'s Computer Bismarck, released in 1980, was the first historical computer wargame. Companies such as SSI, Avalon Hill, MicroProse, and Strategic Studies Group released many strategy titles throughout the 1980s. Reach for the Stars from 1983 was one of the first 4X strategy games, which expanded upon the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest. That same year, Nobunaga's Ambition was a conquest-oriented grand strategy wargame with historical simulation elements. The Lords of Midnight combined elements of adventure, strategy and wargames, and won the Crash magazine award for Best Adventure game of 1984, as well as Best Strategy Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards 1989's Herzog Zwei is often considered the first real-time strategy game,Zzap! Issue 68, December 1990, p.45 - although real-time strategy elements can be found in several earlier games, such as Dan Bunten's Cytron Masters and Don Daglow's Utopia in 1982; K≈çji Sumii's Bokosuka Wars in 1983; D. H. Lawson and John Gibson's Stonkers and Steven Faber's Epidemic! in 1983; and Evryware's The Ancient Art of War in 1984. The genre was popularized by Dune II three years later in 1992. Brett Sperry, the creator of Dune II, coined the name \\"real- time strategy\\" to help market the new game genre he helped popularize. Real- time strategy games changed the strategy genre by emphasizing the importance of time management, with less time to plan. Real-time strategy games eventually began to outsell turn-based strategy games. Since its first title was released in 2000, the Total War series by the Creative Assembly has become the most successful series of strategy games of all time, with sales of copies of Empire: Total War numbering in the millions. Subgenres = 4X = 4X games are a genre of strategy video game in which players control an empire and \\"explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate\\". The term was first coined by Alan Emrich in his September 1993 preview of Master of Orion for Computer Gaming World. Since then, others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and design. 4X games are noted for their deep, complex gameplay. Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development, as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy. Many 4X games also fit into the category of grand strategy. Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of micromanagement needed to sustain an empire scales as the empire grows. 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons, and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement. The earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are also not uncommon. Many 4X games were published in the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier's Civilization and the Total War series are important examples from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that would later become a staple of the genre. In the new 2000 millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful. = Artillery = 223x223px Artillery is the generic name for either early two- or three-player (usually turn-based) computer games involving tanks fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games. Artillery games are among the earliest computer games developed; the theme of such games is an extension of the original uses of computer themselves, which were once used to calculate the trajectories of rockets and other related military-based calculations. Artillery games have been typically described as a type of turn-based tactics game, though they have also been described as a type of \\"shooting game.\\" Examples of this genre are Pocket Tanks, Hogs of War, Scorched 3D and the Worms series. Early precursors to the modern artillery-type games were text-only games that simulated artillery entirely with input data values. A BASIC game known simply as Artillery was written by Mike Forman and was published in Creative Computing magazine in 1976. This seminal home computer version of the game was revised in 1977 by M. E. Lyon and Brian West and was known as War 3; War 3 was revised further in 1979 and published as Artillery-3. These early versions of turn-based tank combat games interpreted human-entered data such as the distance between the tanks, the velocity or \\"power\\" of the shot fired and the angle of the tanks' turrets. = Auto battler (auto chess) = Auto battler, also known as auto chess, is a type of strategy game that features chess-like elements where players place characters on a grid-shaped battlefield during a preparation phase, who then fight the opposing team's characters without any further direct input from the player. It was created and popularized by Dota Auto Chess in early 2019, and saw more games in the genre by other studios, such as Teamfight Tactics, Dota Underlords, and Hearthstone Battlegrounds releasing soon after. = Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) = Vainglory is a multiplayer online battle arena game designed for smartphones and tablets.269x269px Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) is a genre of strategy video games in which each player controls a single character with a set of unique abilities that improve over the course of a game and which contribute to the team's overall strategy. Players work together as a team to achieve a victory condition which is to destroy the opposing team's main structure whilst protecting their own. Player characters, typically called \\"heroes\\" or \\"champions\\", are assisted by computer-controlled units that periodically spawn in groups and march forward along set paths (called \\"lanes\\") toward their enemy's base. Defensive structures, which are usually automatic \\"towers\\", are in place to prevent this. The first team to destroy the opponents' main structure wins the match. The genre is seen as a fusion of real-time strategy games, role-playing games, and action games, however, players usually do not construct either buildings or units. This type of multiplayer online video games gained popularity in early 2010s, with Defense of the Ancients mod for Warcraft III, League of Legends, Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, and Smite being popular. MOBA games are well-represented in esports as well. In 2018, prize pools reached over US$60 million, 40% of the year's total esports prize pools. = Real-time strategy (RTS) = Usually applied only to certain computer strategy games, the moniker real-time strategy (RTS) indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state, and computer real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Very few non-computer strategy games are real-time; one example is Icehouse. Some players dispute the importance of strategy in real-time strategy games, as skill and manual dexterity are often seen as the deciding factor in this genre of game. According to Troy Dunniway, \\"A player controls hundreds of units, dozens of buildings and many different events that are all happening simultaneously. There is only one player, and he can only pay attention to one thing at a time. Expert players can quickly flip between many different tasks, while casual gamers have more problems with this.\\" Ernest Adams goes so far as to suggest that real-time gameplay interferes with strategy. \\"Strategic thinking, at least in the arena of gameplay, does not lend itself well to real-time action\\". Many strategy players claim that many RTS games really should be labeled as \\"real-time tactical\\" (RTT) games since the game play revolves entirely around tactics, with little or even no strategy involved. Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG or MMO) in particular have had a difficult time implementing strategy since having strategy implies some mechanism for \\"winning\\". MMO games, by their nature, are typically designed to be never-ending. Nevertheless, some games are attempting to \\"crack the code,\\" so-to-speak, of the true real-time strategy MMOG.Allen 'Delsyn' Rausch (2008-08-15) \\"Beyond Protocol (PC)\\" Gamespy. Retrieved on 2009-04-10. One method by which they are doing so is by making defenses stronger than the weapons, thereby slowing down combat considerably and making it possible for players to more carefully consider their actions during a confrontation. Customizable units are another way of adding strategic elements, as long as players are truly able to influence the capabilities of their units. The industry is seeking to present new candidates worthy of being known for \\"thought strategy\\" rather than \\"dexterity strategy\\". While Herzog Zwei is regarded as the first true RTS game, the defining title for the genre was Westwood Studios's Dune II, which was followed by their seminal Command & Conquer games. Cavedog's Total Annihilation (1997), Blizzard's Warcraft (1994) series, StarCraft (1998) series, and Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires (1997) series are some of the most popular RTS games. In addition, online games such as NukeZone can be considered belonging in this genre as well. = MMORTS = Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy games, also known as MMORTS, combine real-time strategy (RTS) with a persistent world. Players often assume the role of a general, king, or other type of figurehead leading an army into battle while maintaining the resources needed for such warfare. The titles are often based in a sci-fi or fantasy universe and are distinguished from single or small-scale multiplayer RTS games by the number of players and common use of a persistent world, generally hosted by the game's publisher, which continues to evolve even when the player is offline. = Real-time tactics (RTT) = Real-time tactics (abbreviated RTT(Article at IGN discussing their perception of RTS and related genres as of 2006. RTT is discussed as a new and not yet established genre from the publisher's perspective.) and less commonly referred to as fixed-unit real-time strategy) is a subgenre of tactical wargames played in real-time simulating the considerations and circumstances of operational warfare and military tactics. It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of real-time strategy, and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from real-time strategy gameplay by the lack of resource micromanagement and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include Warhammer: Dark Omen, World In Conflict, the Close Combat series, and early tactical role-playing games such as Bokosuka Wars, Silver Ghost, and First Queen. = Tower defense = Tower defense games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called creeps move along a set path, and the player must place, or \\"build\\" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range. = Turn-based strategy (TBS) = 234x234px The term turn-based strategy (TBS) is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time computer strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action. Examples of this genre are the Civilization, Heroes of Might and Magic, Making History, Advance Wars, Master of Orion and AtWar. TBS games come in two flavors, differentiated by whether players make their plays simultaneously or take turns. The former types of games are called simultaneously executed TBS games, with Diplomacy a notable example. The latter games fall into the player-alternated TBS games category, and are subsequently subdivided into (a) ranked, (b) round-robin start, and (c) random, the difference being the order under which players take their turns. With (a), ranked, the players take their turns in the same order every time. With (b), the first player is selected according to a round-robin policy. With (c), random, the first player is, of course, randomly selected. Almost all non-computer strategy games are turn-based; however, the personal computer game market trend has lately inclined more towards real-time games. Some recent games feature a mix of both real-time and turn-based elements thrown together. = Turn-based tactics (TBT) = Turn-based tactics (TBT), or tactical turn-based (TTB), is a genre of strategy video games that through stop-action simulates the considerations and circumstances of operational warfare and military tactics in generally small-scale confrontations as opposed to more strategic considerations of turn-based strategy (TBS) games. Turn-based tactical gameplay is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using only the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the Wars and X-COM series, as well as tactical role-playing games such as the Jagged Alliance (series), Fire Emblem series and Final Fantasy Tactics. = Wargames = Wargames are a subgenre of strategy video games that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map, as well as historical (or near-historical) accuracy. The primary gameplay mode in a wargame is usually tactical: fighting battles. Wargames sometimes have a strategic mode where players may plan their battle or choose an area to conquer, but players typically spend much less time in this mode and more time actually fighting. Because it is difficult to provide an intelligent way to delegate tasks to a subordinate, war games typically keep the number of units down to hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands. Examples of wargames include Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition and Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, and several titles by Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI) and Strategic Studies Group (SSG).

During these wars, Croatia formed alliances with Eastern Francia and Byzantium against the Bulgarian Empire. First war Boris I (852‚Äì889) During the middle of the 9th century, Bulgaria was the dominant power in the central, eastern, and northern Balkans. In 854, the Bulgarian ruler Boris I forged an official alliance with the Moravian prince Rastislav against Louis the German of East Francia. Duke Trpimir of Croatia was a faithful Frankish vassal and was wary of Bulgaria's ongoing expansion when it reached Croatian borders after the wars against Rascia. Bulgaria is said to have invaded Croatia in approximately 854,De Administrando Imperio but there is also a possibility that King Louis gave some compensation to Trpimir to attack Bulgaria.–ö. –ì—Ä–æ—Ç, –ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è –æ —Å–µ—Ä–±–∞—Ö –∏ —Ö–æ—Ä–≤–∞—Ç–∞—Ö, —Å—Ç—Ä. 125‚Äî127 During the war of 854, there was only one great battle on the territory of present-day northeastern Bosnia, and neither side emerged victorious. Soon afterward, peace negotiations began between Boris of Bulgaria and Trpimir of Croatia, resulting in gifts exchanged and the establishment of peace, with the border between the Croatian Duchy and Bulgaria stabilized at the river of Drina (between modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Serbia). Second war A very long and arduous war was prosecuted between the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I, who wanted to take over the Byzantine Empire, and the Empire's monarch Romanos I. Under heavy pressure from the Bulgarians and amassing defeat after defeat, the Byzantine Empire negotiated with Serbia and Croatia in an effort to forge an alliance against the Bulgarians. Having been informed of these plans by Prince Michael of Zachlumia, who was forced to the islands as the Serbian rulers took direct control of most of his local lands for themselves, Simeon overran Serbia in 924, destroyed it by tricking its nobility, and made it directly part of the Bulgarian Empire. Serbia's ruler Zaharija Pribislavljeviƒá fled and found exile at the Croatian court, while after the realm's destruction massive waves of Serb refugees fled and found refuge in Tomislav's Croatia. Trying to gain Croatian entry into this coalition, Romanos I ordered the province of Dalmatia in ca. 925 to pay taxes not to Byzantium but rather to the Croatian state;\\"Tempore Joannis pape sanctissimo consulatu peragente in provincia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege et Michael in suis finibus presidente duce\\" the Dalmatian territories, including most cities and the northern islands, were henceforth administered by King Tomislav and were to remain under Croatia. Tsar Simeon sent Duke Alogobotur to drive the Serb refugees further into Croatia, causing outright war in ca. 926. The climax of the war was the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands that same year,Bakalov, Istorija na B«élgarija, \\"Simeon I Veliki\\". when Croatian forces under the command of King Tomislav completely defeated the Bulgarian forces under the command of Alogobotur, killing most of the Bulgarians in the battle. The Croatian victory was so decisive and the battle so big that contemporary sources greatly overestimated Croatia's Army at 160,000 men, with a slightly bigger force on the Bulgarian side.De Administrando Imperio, 948, Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos This was the only battle Tsar Simeon ever lost. Since both rulers maintained good relations with Pope John X, the pope was able to negotiate an end to the war soon afterward without any further border changes. Although the eastern border was extended down to the river of Bosnia, the Croatian realm was greatly strengthened both militarily and in natural resources: it emerged from the war as one of the most modern realms of the period and was able to consolidate a moderately sized navy. On the same day as the battle Simeon died in Preslav and his successor Peter I faced internal difficulties and revolts by his brothers Michail and Ivan. The Serbs were able to take advantage of this situation and many of them returned by 931 to their homes in the renewed Serbian realm, thus terminating Croatia's short-lived Bulgarian neighbor at the east. Third war In the second half of the 10th century, the Croatian realm was ruled by Stjepan Dr≈æislav. Stjepan formed an alliance with the Byzantine Empire, which in turn recognized him as the King of his lands.Recipiebant enim regie dignitatis insignia ab imperatoribus Constantinopolitanis et dicebantur eorum eparchi siue patritii After his death in 997, his son Svetoslav Suronja continued his pro-Byzantine policy. His brothers Kre≈°imir III and Gojslav did not want Svetoslav as ruler and attempted a coup d'etat, asking the Bulgarian tsar Samuil for help. Answering their call, Samuil went on a rampage in 998 and razed the Dalmatian cities of Trogir and Split, but he was stopped at the siege of Zadar. The Bulgarian forces then returned home,Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja using the Bosnian route. Territory taken by Samuil during the war was given to Kre≈°imir III and Gojslav, who, with further Bulgarian support, won the Croatian civil war and took over the realm in the year 1000. Svetoslav Suronja, a Byzantine and Venetian ally, was sent to exile in Venice, but after a change in government there he was exiled to Hungary. Following the death of Ivan Vladislav in 1018, Bulgaria fell under Byzantine rule, and Kre≈°imir III and Gojslav, the two Croatian kings, became Byzantine vassals.

In the F1 complex, the central gamma subunit forms the rotor inside the cylinder made of the alpha(3)beta(3) subunits, while in the Fo complex, the ring-shaped C subunits forms the rotor. The two rotors rotate in opposite directions, but the Fo rotor is usually stronger, using the force from the proton gradient to push the F1 rotor in reverse in order to drive ATP synthesis. These ATPases can also work in reverse to hydrolyse ATP to create a proton gradient. The ATPase F1 complex gamma subunit forms the central shaft that connects the Fo rotary motor to the F1 catalytic core. The gamma subunit functions as a rotary motor inside the cylinder formed by the alpha(3)beta(3) subunits in the F1 complex. The best-conserved region of the gamma subunit is its C-terminus, which seems to be essential for assembly and catalysis.

Her story was told by Farley Mowat.  Relocation  Kikkik was a member of the Ihalmiut (Ahiarmiut), a Caribou Inuit band who had originally lived in the Ennadai Lake area. In 1949, the Ihalmiut were relocated by the Government of Canada to Nueltin Lake. However, hunting was poor at Nueltin and over time the people returned to Ennadai. In 1957, the Government again moved the Ihalmiut, now numbering 59 people, to the Henik Lake area, 45 miles from Padlei, the closest trading post. The Henik group split in two early on.Damas, 2002  Desperate circumstances  During 1957 caribou, the Ihalmiut's main source of food, did not appear. Consequently, the Henik group began to starve during the winter. Kikkik, her husband Hallow (Hallauk), and their children (son Karlak; daughters Ailoyoak, Annecatha, Nesha, and baby Nokahhak [Elisapee]) had their igloo close to her half-brother Ootek (Ootuk) and his family. Ootek had not been able to provide for his family. Now Ootek told his wife that he was going to the trading post at Padlei, but went and visited Hallow. Hallow left to go fishing and, after a short period, he was followed by Ootek, who had brought his rifle. Creeping up behind Hallow, who was fishing, Ootek shot him in the back of the head. Ootek then returned to Kikkik's igloo, but she became suspicious and followed him as he left the igloo. He shot at her but she pushed the rifle aside. She fought with Ootek, who was weak from hunger, and forced him to the ground; he confessed to having murdered Hallow. Sitting on Ootek to hold him down, Kikkik got her son Karlak to give her a knife, but it wasn't sharp enough to kill Ootek. One of her other children then brought her another knife and Kikkik killed Ootek with it. Kikkik found her dead husband and placed his rifle next to him, as is the Ihalmiut's custom. She loaded up a sled with the few supplies she had, bundled her infant onto her back, and began the 40 mile walk to Padlei with the children. After a few days she met Yahah, Hallow's brother, and she followed him to his camp. She waited there while her brother-in-law went to Padlei. After five days, without food, and no sign of Yahah, she and the children resumed the trek. After a few more days, she was unable to continue with all the children and left Annecatha and Nesha, both under age 10, wrapped in caribou skin, in an igloo she made with a frying pan.  Rescue and trial  Kikkik, Karlak, Ailoyoak, and baby Nokahhak were rescued by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police aircraft that also was able to find the two stranded girls, one of whom had died. Kikkik was charged with the murder of Ootek, child neglect for abandoning Annecatha, and causing the death of Nesha. At her trial, in Rankin Inlet, presided over by Judge John Sissons, Kikkik was found not guilty of all charges. Sissons, in his remarks to the jury said the case \\"demands that we revert our thinking to an earlier age and try to understand Kikkik and her life and her land and her society\\" and that she should be judged by her culture.  Aftermath  Her story was featured in the 1959 book The Desperate People by Farley Mowat. Kikkik never talked about this part of her life, nor did community elders. Her children did not learn of it until Annecatha read Mowat's book. Kikkik's story was also turned into two documentaries featuring daughter Elisapee (n√©e Nurrahaq [Nokahhak]) Karetak in 2000 (English) and 2002 (Inuktitut).  Sources  * Damas, David.

It was frequented by the colonial French as a popular get-away. The hotel is located at 12 Tran Phu Street. History Originally called the Lang-Bian Palace Hotel, it was completed and opened in 1922, at the height of an economic boom, and was designed to be a site of colonial leisure and power. 'The hotels monumentalism, modernity, luxury and location made it a conspicuous symbol of French domination over the Indochinese central highlands.'Imperial Heights, Eric Jennings, p.139 It was positioned at the centre of a European business and administrative quarter, dominated the \\"native quarters\\" and served as a buffer between them and the European villas. As a luxurious establishment it could act also as a serene base from which to explore highland minority villages or conduct big-game expeditions, and meant to compete with the poshest colonial hotels of Southeast Asia, such as the Oriental Hotel, Bangkok and the Raffles Hotel, Singapore.Jennings p.139 It initially featured thirty-eight luxury rooms, as well as an orchestra, a cinema, tennis courts, private fruit and vegetable gardens, a dance hall, riding facilities, gymnastic equipment and a French restaurant. Architectutrally the Palace followed metropolitan French resort styles, merging elements of spa towns like Vittel with seaside architectural elements borrowed from towns like Cabourg or Cannes. French novelist w:fr:Morgan Sport√®s, in his depiction of Indochina during WW2, has described it as reminiscent of the Negresco Hotel, in Nice.Jennings p143 When economic circumstances changed, later in the 1920s, most plans for government structures in Dalat were abandoned, leaving the town with a Palace Hotel as its monumental centerpiece. Vichy governor general of Indochina, Jean Decoux, in 1943, got rid of the ornate fa√ßade.Jennings, 143-144 In 1925 a city health inspection reported that the kitchens and their surroundings exhibited, \\"a condition of considerable filth\\".Jennings, p.142 In 1943, under the Vichy governor general of Indochina, Admiral Decoux, the fa√ßade was altered, and changed to a starker exterior. This was 'almost certainly inspired by architect Paul Vesseyre's two other 'Palaces' in Dalat, Bao Dai's and the governor generals, built in 1934 and 1937 respectively, in a style more of art deco or even Bauhaus than of the fin-de-si√®cle spa style.' Jennings, p.144 Decoux did not like what he regarded as out-dated ornamentation and was part of a movement at this time to simplify complex lines and to cut out rococo elements. Other examples of Decoux's attitude were the treatment he visited upon the palace of the governor general of Cochinchina in Saigon, removing the two caryatids, and the celebrated Saigon theatre, whose statues and bas- reliefs were destroyed on Decoux's orders.Jennings, p.144 The Lang-Bian/Dalat Palace became the Dalat Palace after the Second World War, -although earlier uses of the latter also exist. In the early 1990s reclusive The Independent, 12 January 1998 tycoon Larry Hillblom set out upon a lavish restoration project - a rather plain dining room was converted into a grand restaurant for example, and the hotel was aimed at attracting high-end tourism. Hillblom, (the 'H' of the DHL courier empire), invested around forty million dollars into reviving the hotel, that had languished since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975.Jennings, p.155-157  Literature  * References  External links  *Dalat Palace Homepage Category:Hotels in Vietnam Category:Da Lat Category:French Colonial architecture in Vietnam Category:Buildings and structures in L√¢m ƒê·ªìng Province Category:Hotels established in 1922 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1922 ","title":"Dalat Palace Hotel"},{"id":"14876960","text":"D-dopachrome decarboxylase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the DDT gene.

Although he did not aspire to play at a professional level, Suomi nevertheless spent his young life playing hockey and was eventually scouted while playing with friends. Suomi began his career playing for the Chicago Baby Ruth team in 1934, a marketing ploy started by the company that produced the candy of the same name. In 1936, he joined a minor league team in Detroit, Michigan and, based on his experiences with the Chicago Baby Ruth team, was deemed too professional to be eligible for the 1936 United States Olympic ice hockey team. Suomi's sole season with the National Hockey League came as a result of another marketing ploy, this time on the part of the Chicago Black Hawks. Having benched all of his Canadian players, the manager declared his intent to field a team composed entirely of American players. Suomi was selected from among a pool of novice players to join the team but, after five games, the gimmick was disbanded and replaced with professionals. Retiring from hockey in 1940, he took on a series of small jobs before opening his own hardware store in Chicago. As of 2007, Suomi was the last surviving member of the 1936‚Äì37 all-American Chicago Black Hawks team and, following the 2010 death of Louis Holmes, the oldest living former NHL player. He is also believed to be the first former NHL player to reach the age of 100. Early life Suomi was born to a working-class family in Eveleth, Minnesota on October 29, 1913. His father was an immigrant from Finland. Although Suomi never had any serious aspirations to play professional ice hockey, he nevertheless began practicing at local rinks at an early age, focusing on his talents as a left winger. As a teenager, he played at both the high school and college level. His brother, John Suomi, played minor league hockey in Virginia. In 1934, during the Great Depression, he and two of his friends were approached by scout Jack Manley, who offered them a chance to play professional hockey in Chicago. With only one hour to catch the bus to Minneapolis, Minnesota, Suomi decided that he had nothing to lose and took his belongings in a cardboard box with him to the bus station. Hockey career For the 1934‚Äì35 season, Suomi was a member of the Chicago Baby Ruth team of the United States Amateur Hockey Association league, participating in two playoff games and scoring a total of two goals. The team was designed as a marketing gimmick for the Curtis Candy Company, and played before all of the Chicago Black Hawk games in order to increase their attendance. While Suomi made the team, his two friends were rejected and they returned to Minnesota. For the next season, from 1935‚Äì36, he was called to Michigan and joined the Detroit Tool Shop of the Michigan-Ontario Hockey League. He was offered an opportunity to try out for the 1936 Olympic ice hockey team for the United States, but his past association led him to be rejected for being too professional. He played 17 regular season games for the Detroit Tool Shop, scoring eight goals and five assists for a total of 13 points. During the regular season, he had six penalty minutes. In addition, he played in four playoff games, scoring one assist. In 1936 Suomi, along with other MOHL players, took jobs in Denver, Colorado. Unlike the others, however, he received an invitation to try out for the Chicago Black Hawks, which he accepted despite threats of a lawsuit from his employer. In another marketing ploy, Black Hawk owner Frederic McLaughlin had benched all the Canadian players on his team and declared his intentions to field a team that consisted entirely of individuals born in the United States. The 1936‚Äì37 was Suomi's sole season in the National Hockey League. He played five games with the Black Hawks, but scored no points, and, after four wins and one loss, Suomi and the other Americans were let go and replaced with the professionals. According to some statistics, Suomi spent the remainder of the 1936‚Äì37 season with the Michigan-Ontario Hockey League's Detroit Pontiacs. Over the span of 20 games, he scored only two points, but spent 14 minutes in the penalty box. In a 2002 interview, however, he denied having ever played for the team. His last season in hockey was with the Chicago Hornets of the Arena Hockey League. Later life Al's hardware store, in Countryside, Illinois.After the ArHL folded in 1940, Suomi began refereeing, but soon gave it up. He then worked as a welder and electrician and was not called to serve in World War II. He later founded \\"Al's Hardware\\", eventually to be run by his children, in Countryside, Illinois. As of 2007, he was the last surviving member of the team. Following the death of Louis Holmes in March 2010, he became the oldest living former NHL player, a title that he held until his death at the age of 100 on September 23, 2014.

The protein encoded by this gene functions in the second step of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. It catalyzes the hydration of 2-trans-enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) intermediates to L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs. The gene product is a member of the hydratase/isomerase superfamily. It localizes to the mitochondrial matrix. Transcript variants utilizing alternative transcription initiation sites have been described in the literature. Structure The ECHS1 gene is approximately 11 kb in length, and is composed of eight exons, with exons I and VIII containing the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions, respectively. There are two major transcription start sites, located 62 and 63 bp upstream of the translation codon, were mapped by primer extension analysis. The 5'-flanking region of the ECHS1 gene is GC-rich and contains several copies of the SP1 binding motive but no typical TATA or CAAT boxes are apparent. Alu repeat elements have been identified within the region -1052/-770 relative to the cap site and in intron 7. The precursor polypeptide contains 290 amino acid residues, with an N-terminal presequence of 29 residues, a 5'-untranslated sequence of 21 bp and a 3'-untranslated sequence of 391 bp. Function Enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) catalyzes the second step in beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acid metabolism. The enzyme is involved in the formation of a Œ≤-hydroxyacyl-CoA thioester. The two catalytic glutamic acid residues are believed to act in concert to activate a water molecule, while Gly-141 is proposed to be involved in substrate activation. There are two potent inhibitors of ECHS, which irreversibly inactivate the enzyme via covalent adduct formation. Clinical significance Enoyl-CoA hydratase short chain has been confirmed to interact with STAT3, such that ECHS1 specifically represses STAT3 activity by inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 can act as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor. ECHS1 itself has shown to occur in many cancers, particularly in hypatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development; both exogenous and endogenous forms of ECHS1 bind to HBs and induce apoptosis as a result. This means that ECHS1 may be used in the future as a therapy for patients with HBV-related hepatitis or HCC.

In 1948, Mathieu Franchini, head of the Indochina Tourism & Exhibition Department bought the ground and first floors of the hotel and rented 44 rooms in the building for the next 30 years. The hotel was expanded in 1965; two more stories were added based on the design of Vietnamese architect Ngo Viet Thu. It is located at 1 Dong Khoi Street, formerly rue Catinat. After 1975, the hotel name was changed to Mekong Hotel (Kh√°ch S·∫°n C·ª≠u Long): and it became a government guest house. It was recently renamed again to the original name, the six storey building is now a 5 star hotel overlooking the Saigon River. It is owned by the state-owned Saigon Tourist.

Together with Electron-transfer-flavoprotein, beta subunit, encoded by the 'ETFB' gene, it forms the heterodimericElectron transfer flavoprotein (ETF). The native ETF protein contains one molecule of FAD and one molecule of AMP, respectively. First reports on the ETF protein were based on ETF isolated from porcine liver . Porcine and human ETF transfer electrons from mitochondrial matrix flavoenzymes to Electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO) encoded by the ETFDH gene. ETF-QO subsequently relays the electrons via ubiquinone to complex III in the respiratory chain. The flavoenzymes that transfer electrons to ETF are involved in fatty acid beta oxidation, amino acid catabolism, choline metabolism, and special metabolic pathways. Defects in either of the ETF subunits or ETFDH cause multiple acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (OMIM # 231680), earlier called glutaric acidemia type II. MADD is characterized by excretion of a series of substrates of the upstream flavoenzyes, e.g. glutaric, lactic, ethylmalonic, butyric, isobutyric, 2-methyl-butyric, and isovaleric acids.  Evolutionary relationships  ETF is an evolutionarily ancient protein with orthologues found in all kingdoms of life. ETFs are grouped into 3 subgroups, I, II, and III. The best studied group are group I ETFs that in eukaryotic cells are localized in the mitochondrial matrix space. Group I ETFs transfer electrons between flavoenzymes. Group II ETFs may also receive electrons from ferredoxin or NADH.  Gene, expression, and subcellular localization  The human ETFA gene encoding the alpha subunit of ETF (ETF-Œ±) is localized on chromosome 15 (15q24.2-q24.3). It is composed of 12 exons. Little is known about its promoter and transcriptional regulation. Global expression analyses show that it is expressed at substantial levels in most tissues (PROTEOMICXS DB). ETF-Œ± is translated as a precursor protein with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. It is posttranslationally imported into the mitochondrial matrix space, where the targeting sequence is cut off.  Posttranslational modifications and regulation  Acetylation and succinylation of lysine residues and phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in ETF-Œ± have been reported in mass spectrometric analyses of posttranslational modifications P13804. Electron transfer flavoprotein regulatory factor 1 (ETFRF1) has been identified as a protein that specifically binds ETF and this interaction has been indicated to inactivate ETF by displacing the FAD.  Structure and interaction with redox partners  As first shown for porcine ETF, one chain of ETF-Œ± assembles with one chain of ETF-Œ≤, and one molecule each of FAD and AMP to the dimeric native enzyme. The crystal structure of human ETF was reported in 1996. This showed that ETF consists of three distinct domains (I, II, and III). The FAD is bound in a cleft between the two subunits and interacts mainly with the C-terminal part of ETF-Œ±. The AMP is buried in domain III. A crystal structure of the complex of one of its interactors, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD; gene name ACADM) has been determined. (toogood 2004+2007). This identified a so- called recognition loop formed by ETF-Œ≤ that anchors ETF on one subunit of the homotetrameric MCAD enzyme. This interaction triggers conformational changes and the highly mobile redox active FAD domain of ETF swings to the FAD domain of a neighboring subunit of the MCAD tetramer bringing the two FAD molecules into close contact for interprotein electron transfer.  Molecular Function  Human ETF receives electrons from at least 14 flavoenzymes and transfers them to ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductases (ETF:QO) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. ETF:QO in turn relays them to ubiquinone from where they enter the respiratory chain at complex III. Most of the flavoenzymes transferring electrons to ETF are participating in fatty acid oxidation, amino acid catabolism, and choline metabolism. ETF and ETF:QO thus represent an important hub for transfer of electrons from various redox reactions and feeding them into the respiratory chain for energy production.  Genetic deficiencies and molecular pathogenesis  Deleterious mutations in the ETFA and ETFB genes encoding ETF or the ETFDH gene encoding ETF:QO are associated with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD; OMIM #231680; previously called glutaric aciduria type II). Biochemically, MADD is characterized by elevated levels of a series of carnitine conjugates of the substrates of the different partner dehydrogenases of the ETF/ETF:QO hub, e.g. glutaric, lactic, ethylmalonic, butyric, isobutyric, 2-methyl-butyric, and isovaleric acids.[5] Accumulation of substrates and derivatives of the upstream dehydrogenases and energy deficiency upon fasting cause the clinical phenotype. Mostly depending on the severity of the mutation, the disease is divided into three subgroups: type I (neonatal onset with congenital anomalies), type II (neonatal onset without congenital anomalies), and type III (late onset). There is no cure for the disease, and treatment is employing a diet limiting protein and fat intake, avoidance of prolonged fasting, both to alleviate the flow through the partner dehydrogenases.

A periodicals librarian can have a variety of duties, but generally work specifically with the acquisition, collection development, organization, preservation, and sometimes cataloging of periodicals. Whereas many periodicals librarians previously worked only with periodicals in print format, many now manage electronic periodicals also. While a periodicals librarians may work in any type of library, including academic, public, government, law, medical, or corporate libraries, a significant number work in larger public and academic libraries. In other libraries where there is no librarian assigned specifically to periodicals, one or more librarians may perform the duties of a periodicals librarian along with other duties. Roles and duties The duties of a periodicals librarian are changing as technology and the needs of library patrons change. The duties may include, but are not limited to, establishing and maintaining subscriptions to periodicals in print, microform, and electronic formats; providing personal assistance and guidance in identifying, locating, and using periodicals; designing and conducting instructional sessions on how to use electronic journals and databases; evaluating the existing periodicals collection by performing collection analysis and usage studies; creating activities, programs, or presentations to promote the periodicals collection; establishing and maintaining contact with faculty, students, or other constituents to be sure the periodicals collection is meeting their needs; assisting and instructing faculty of a college, university, or school on the integrating of periodicals into the curriculum; supervising and developing student workers and support staff; managing budget allocations for materials, systems, and services; physical repair of periodicals; supervising paraprofessional staff, other librarians, and student workers (Kane, 74‚Äì75). Advances in technology have significantly advanced the way that periodicals departments in libraries function. For example, open url resolvers, systems which allow a libraries to give greater visibility and access to their electronic journal content. Many libraries have gone to electronic-only subscriptions on some periodicals, significantly expanding access for their patrons. Periodicals librarians frequently set up access to electronic journals and other electronic resources, as well as to troubleshoot them when they do not work properly (Davis, 149). Education In most western nations, a periodicals librarian must have a master's degree in library science to work in an academic or public library. Generally, the master's degree takes one to two years to complete. Many academic and public libraries in the United States require a master's degree from a school of library science accredited by the American Library Association. Librarians working for the federal government are often required to have a master's degree in library or an equivalent in education and experience. Some may have additional degrees in a subject area (Kane, 75).

This gene encodes a member of the class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolase gene family. Expressed specifically in the hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the brain, the encoded protein is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible aldol cleavage of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-1-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and either glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or glyceraldehyde, respectively.[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]  Structure  ALDOC is one of the three aldolase isozymes (A, B, and C), encoded by three different genes. The amino acid sequence of ALDOC is highly similar to those of the other isozymes, sharing a 68% identity with ALDOB and 78% identity with ALDOA. In particular, the residues Asp33, Arg42, Lys107, Lys146, Glu187, Ser271, Arg303, and Lys229 are all conserved in the active sites of the three isozymes. This active site is located in the center of the homotetrameric Œ±Œ≤-barrel structure of these aldolases. However, several structural details set ALDOC apart. For instance, the Arg303 residue in ALDOC adopts an intermediate conformation between the liganded and unliganded structures observed in the other isozymes. Also, the C-terminal region between Glu332 and Lys71 forms a salt bridge with the barrel region that is absent in the A and B isoforms. Moreover, the electrostatic surface of ALDOC is more negatively charged, which may serve as an acidic binding site or as a docking site to accommodate the C-terminal conformations. Four ALDOC-specific residues (N90, V92, R96 and D100) may be key for ALDOC-specific functions.  Function  ALDOC is a key enzyme in the fourth step of glycolysis, as well as in the reverse pathway gluconeogenesis. It catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate (G3P), or glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by aldol cleavage. As a result, it is a crucial player in ATP biosynthesis. As an aldolase, ALDOC putatively also contributes to other \\"moonlighting\\" functions, though its exact involvements remain unclear. For instance, it binds less tightly to the cytoskeleton than the other isozymes do, likely due to its more acidic pI. In addition, ALDOC participates in the stress-response pathway for lung epithelial cell function during hypoxia and in the resistance of cerebellar Purkinje cells against excitotoxic insult. ALDOC is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, though it is predominantly expressed in brain, smooth muscle, and neuronal tissue. However, since the ALDOA isoform is co-expressed with ALDOC in the central nervous system (CS), it is suggested that ALDOC contributes to CNS function outside of glycolysis. Moreover, its presence within other cell types, such as platelets and mast cells (MCs), may serve as a failsafe in the case that the other predominant aldolase isozymes become inactivated. Within cells, it localizes to the cytoplasm.  Clinical significance  This aldolase has been associated with cancer. ALDOC is found to be upregulated in the brains of schizophrenia (SCZ) patients. Notably, while ALDOC is differentially expressed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of male SCZ patients, it displays no significant changes in female SCZ patients, indicating that different regulatory mechanisms may be involved in male versus female SCZ patients. It is likely that ALDOC is involved in SCZ through its role in glycolysis, which is a central biochemical pathway in SCZ. Furthermore, ALDOC is reported to undergo oxidation in brains affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This oxidative modification inhibits ALDOC activity, causing the accumulation of fructose 1,6- bisphosphate and driving the reverse reaction, in the direction of gluconeogenesis rather than glycolysis, thus halting ATP production.

KDM2A is a member of the superfamily of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases, which are non-haem iron-containing proteins.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbls class and, in addition to an F-box, contains at least 6 highly degenerated leucine-rich repeats. FBXL11/KDM2A is a histone H3 lysine 36 demethylase enzyme. The enzymatic activity of FBXL11/KDM2A relies on a conserved JmjC domain in the N-terminus of the protein that co-ordinates iron and alphaketoglutarate to catalyze demethylation via a hydroxylation based mechanism. It has recently been demonstrated that a ZF-CxxC DNA binding domain within FBXL11/KDM2A has the capacity to interact with non-methylated DNA and this domain targets FBXL11/KDM2A to CpG island regions of the genome where it specifically removes histone H3 lysine 36 methylation. This mechanism acts to create a chromatin environment at CpG islands that highlights these regulatory elements and differentiates them from non-regulatory regions in large complex mammalian genomes. In a study in mouse hepatocytes, this gene was shown to regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis.

This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 residue structural motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein), which often, but not always, recognize substrates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: * Fbxws containing WD40 repeats, * Fbxls containing leucine-rich repeats, * and Fbxos containing either \\"other\\" protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by FBXW11 belongs to the Fbxw class as, in addition to an F-box, this protein contains multiple WD40 repeats. This protein is homologous to Xenopus Œ≤TrCP, yeast Met30, Neurospora Scon2 and Drosophila Slimb. In mammals, in addition to Œ≤TrCP2, a paralog protein (called Œ≤TrCP1 or FBXW1) also exists, but, so far, their functions appear redundant and indistinguishable. Discovery Human Œ≤TrCP (referred to both Œ≤TrCP1 and Œ≤TrCP2) was originally identified as a cellular ubiquitin ligase that is bound by the HIV-1 Vpu viral protein to eliminate cellular CD4 by connecting it to the proteolytic machinery. Subsequently, Œ≤TrCP was shown to regulate multiple cellular processes by mediating the degradation of various targets. Cell cycle regulators constitute a major group of Œ≤TrCP substrates. During S phase, Œ≤TrCP keeps CDK1 in check by promoting the degradation of the phosphatase CDC25A, whereas in G2, Œ≤TrCP contributes to CDK1 activation by targeting the kinase WEE1 for degradation. In early mitosis, Œ≤TrCP mediates the degradation of EMI1, an inhibitor of the APC/C ubiquitin ligase complex, which is responsible for the anaphase-metaphase transition (by inducing the proteolysis of Securin) and mitotic exit (by driving the degradation of mitotic CDK1 activating cyclin subunits). Furthermore, Œ≤TrCP controls APC/C by targeting REST, thereby removing its transcriptional repression on MAD2, an essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint that keeps APC/C inactive until all chromatids are attached to the spindle microtubles. Functions Œ≤TrCP plays important roles in regulating cell cycle checkpoints. In response to genotoxic stress, it contributes to turn off CDK1 activity by mediating the degradation of CDC25A in collaboration with Chk1, thereby preventing cell cycle progression before the completion of DNA repair. During recovery from DNA replication and DNA damage, Œ≤TrCP instead targets Claspin in a Plk1-dependent manner. Œ≤TrCP has also emerged as an important player in protein translation, cell growth and survival. In response to mitogens, PDCD4, an inhibitor of the translation initiation factor eIF4A, is rapidly degraded in a Œ≤TrCP- and S6K1-dependent manner, allowing efficient protein translation and cell growth. Œ≤TrCP also cooperates with mTOR and CK1Œ± to induce the degradation of DEPTOR (an mTOR inhibitor), thereby generating an auto-amplification loop to promote the full activation of mTOR. At the same time, Œ≤TrCP mediates the degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein BimEL to promote cell survival. Œ≤TrCP also associates with phosphorylated IkappaBalpha and beta-catenin destruction motifs, probably functioning in multiple transcriptional programs by regulating the NF-kappaB and the WNT pathways.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. The C-terminus of the EST1A protein contains a PilT N-terminus (PIN) domain. This structure for this domain has been determined by X-ray crystallography. SMG6 functions to bind single-stranded DNA in telomere maintenance and single-stranded RNA in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The SMG6 gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The SMG6 gene resides on chromosome 17 at the band 17p13.3 and contains 30 exons. This gene produces 3 isoforms through alternative splicing. = Protein = SMG6 is one of three human homologs for Est1p found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It contains a PIN domain, which is characteristic of proteins with ribonuclease activity. The PIN domain forms an alpha/beta fold structure that similar to that found in 5' nucleases. Within the PIN domain is a canonical triad of acidic residues that functions to cleave single-stranded RNA. SMG6 also shares a phosphoserine- binding domain resembling the one in 14‚Äì3‚Äì3 proteins with its other two homologs, SMG5 and SMG7. This 14‚Äì3‚Äì3-like domain and a C-terminal helical hairpins domain with seven Œ±-helices stacked perpendicular to the 14‚Äì3‚Äì3-like domain together form a monomeric tetratricopeptide region (TPR). Differences in the orientation and specific residues in the TPR between SMG6 and its homologs may account for why SMG6 does not form a complex with SMG5 and SMG7 when recruited by UPF1.  Function  SMG6 is broadly expressed in all human tissues. It has dual functions in telomere maintenance and RNA surveillance pathways. SMG6 binds single-stranded telomere DNA and cooperates with telomerase reverse transcriptase to lengthen telomeres. Overexpression of SMG6 induces anaphase bridges due to chromosome-end fusions and, thus, affects telomere capping, which may directly induce an apoptotic response. SMG6 also functions as an endonuclease in the NMD pathway. The catalytic activity of SMG6 resides in its PIN domain, which is required for the degradation of premature translation termination codons (PTC)-containing mRNAs in human cells. SMG6 cleaves mRNA near the premature translocation-termination codons and requires UPF1 and SMG1 to reduce reporter mRNA levels.  Clinical significance  In humans, selected genomic regions based on 150 SNPs were identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on coronary artery disease. Accordingly, the association between recent smoking and the CpG sites within and near these coronary artery disease-related genes were investigated in 724 Caucasian subjects from the Rotterdam Study. The identified methylation sites were found in SMG6 together with other genes, and several of these sites exhibited lower methylation in subjects currently smoking compared to never smoking. = Clinical marker = A multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the SMG6 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy.

It was used as the Hotel Phnom Penh in the 1984 film The Killing Fields. The hotel occupies land leased from its owner, the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). The lease will expire in 2020. History The hotel dates back to the time when Hua Hin itself was evolving into Thailand's first beach resort. The beauty of Hua Hin was noted by the engineers surveying the southern railway route in 1909. Land was set aside for a station, and when the first section of the line opened in 1911 Hua Hin became a destination where wealthy Bangkok residents built their holiday homes. The southern line to Malaysia was completed in 1921, making it possible to travel between Bangkok, Malaysia, and Singapore by train. Mr. A. Rigazai, the State Railways' Italian architect, designed the original building as a luxurious two-storey European-style resort hotel made of brick and wood, in accordance with royal command. The hotel was constructed on State Railways land while existing bungalows were moved a short distance away. The hotel featured 14 bedrooms, a lobby lounge, bar, restaurant, billiards room, wine storeroom, and large verandas, costing a total of 128,366.75 baht, a staggering sum at the time. A veranda surrounded the building, cleverly designed to protect guests from the sun's heat and prevent rainwater from running back along the tiles. The building was remarkably similar in appearance to the Marukhatayawan Royal Residence in nearby Cha-am. The hotel opened in October 1922 and had its grand opening on 1 January 1923. King Rama VI commissioned road maintenance engineer A. O. Robins to build a golf course on land opposite the railway station, completing the original nine-hole, 3,000-yard Royal Hua-Hin Golf Course and tennis courts in time to welcome the first hotel guests on 26 October 1922. \\"The railway era brought great changes to Siam, as Thailand was then known,\\" says Thirayuth Chirathivat, chief executive officer of Centara Hotels & Resorts. \\"There were very few roads into the provincial areas, and places such as Hua Hin were known only to the local population. When the railway was built from Bangkok down to Malaysia, it suddenly became possible for the aristocracy of the day to travel to Hua Hin, and to enjoy the beach and the ocean.\\" By 1928 the hotel's reputation was international and, in order to accommodate the growing number of visitors to Hua Hin, RSR added a new wing of 13 rooms, built to exactly the same design as the existing building. After WWII two more guestrooms were added, along with three restaurants, a downstairs bar, and a lobby with a panoramic view of Hua Hin's bay. In 1988, the hotel was purchased by Sofitel and became the Hotel Sofitel Central Hua Hin. As of September 2014 it is run by the Central Plaza Hotel Public Company (CENTEL), Ltd. and named the Centara Grand Beach Resort & Villas Hua Hin.

The hotel has 154 rooms, including three presidential suites, four junior suites, including a governor's suite that have been maintained to preserve the traditional design. The Grand Hotel has a number of restaurants, bars and a billiards room.  History  The original building, a single storey bungalow, called 'Barnes Hall', was constructed as the holiday residence of Sir Edward Barnes, the fifth Governor of Ceylon (1776-1838) in 1828, for the sum of ¬£8,000. Following Barnes' departure from Ceylon in 1831 it was rented to his successor as Governor, Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton. It was subsequently purchased by Reginald Beauchamp Downall (1843-1888), a planter and member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon, who operated it a small guest house/hotel. On 12 April 1892 it was sold to the Nuwara Eliya Hotels Company Limited. William Milsom, owner of ‚Äúproperty...... known as Barnes Hall on which is built the Grand Hotel‚Äù sold it to the Company for Rs. 35,000/-. The total area, which was in three separate lots amounted at the time of sale to approximately 27 acres. In the 1890s a second storey was added to the building. The northern wing (now known as the Governors Wing), originally only a single storey, linked by an archway with the main building, was added. A further extension was opened in 1904, with a second floor added to the northern wing linked by corridor with the additional floor of the main building. An additional southern wing (now known as the Golf Wing) was then added to the building. In the 1930s the third storey was constructed with its mock Tudor facade. The main restaurant, Barnes Hall, was named for the former governor. Notable guests who have stayed at the Grand include the Duc d‚ÄôAbruzzi (brother of the Italian Sovereign), Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (nephew of King Edward), the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Prince Reuss XXXII, the Maharaja of Kapurthala, Jagatjit Singh and Sir Thomas Lipton. Lord Mountbatten is also reported to have stayed at the Grand. The Hotel hosted the 21st session of the SAARC Council of Ministers Conference on 10 March 1999.  Awards  In the 1990s the Archeology Department of Sri Lanka identified the Grand Hotel as a 'National Heritage Property'. In 2005 the SAGA food award was awarded to the Grand Hotel. The award is based on the year's customer feedback and regular inspections carried out by \\"SAGA Holidays\\" for consistency and standards maintained for food quality, presentation, Variety, hygiene and service. The hotel subsequently won the award for the following four years. In 2009 the Grand Hotel was awarded a 'Four Star' status by the Hotels Classification Committee of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. In the same year the Grand Hotel was placed first in the 'commercial large' category for the 23rd consecutive year at the \\"April Blooms\\" flower competition organized by the Municipality of Nuwara Eliya. In 2012, National Geographic Traveler listed Sri Lanka as one of six countries to visit that year. In the same article, the Grand Hotel was listed as one of six places in the country to visit (the others being Adam's Peak, Sigiriya, Sri Dalada Maligawa, Dambulla cave temple, and Yala National Park). The annual report for 2011/12, won the Bronze Award in the Hotel Companies category, conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.

It was built and modified from 1791 to 1925 by Lieutenant William Dawes, Robert Ross, Francis Greenway, and George Barney. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002. History Dawes Point is a prominent landmark in Sydney Harbour, terminating the western arm of Sydney Cove. It has a rich documented history beginning with the one of the earliest recorded cultural exchanges between the Eora Aboriginals and the First Fleet. Subsequently, it remained in government ownership both as a place of strategic administration, defence and transport and as a place contributing to the magnificent landscape of our harbour city. The Point forms part of Sydney's historic Rocks precinct. The first known building to be constructed on the site of Point Maskelyne (later renamed Dawes Point) was an observatory constructed in early 1788 by Lieutenant William Dawes, of the Royal Marines. A powder magazine was installed in 1789 followed by the battery in 1791. The first guns came from , which had wrecked at Norfolk Island the year before. A dispute in 1790 between Spain and Britain, leading to fear of a Spanish attack, motivated the project. In 1798, the Governor's concerns regarding the arrival of schooner prompted defensive measures at the Battery. George Barney, one of Australia's most important colonial engineers of the mid-19th century, oversaw the construction. The site had previously been used as a cemetery for prisoners executed at Sydney Gaol (1797-). In 1810 Napoleon ordered the French forces at √éle de France to launch an attack on Sydney. However, the Royal Navy captured the island, forestalling any attack. During the Napoleonic Wars French and Spanish ships captured in the Pacific Ocean and brought into Sydney harbour received salutes from the battery. The fort was expanded substantially in 1819 when Governor Lachlan Macquarie ordered convict Francis Greenway, who was an architect, to design and construct improvements. The result was a semicircular battery, supported by a new, decorative castellated guardhouse built on the site of the 1780 powder magazine, which now provided the guardhouse's basement. The elaborate defences were meant to appear threatening to ships sailing into Sydney Harbour. In that same year sandstone blocks were quarried on site at Dawes Point Park for the construction of the fort. The fort was expanded substantially in 1819. Further buildings were constructed in the 1850s and at the end of the century. The site had also been used as a cemetery for prisoners executed at Old Sydney Gaol (1797-). The Aroostook War, a confrontation in 1838‚Äì1839 between the United States and the United Kingdom over the international boundary between the British colony of New Brunswick and the US state of Maine, raised concerns over the harbour's defenses. The arrival of two American sloops during the night, however peaceful, highlighted the colony's vulnerability. The Russian success in repulsing an Anglo-French force in the Siege of Petropavlovsk, in the northern Pacific during the Crimean War (1854‚Äì56), raised concerns that the Russian Pacific Fleet would attack Sydney. At the time New South Wales was undergoing an economic boom following the discovery of gold. The colonial government enlarged Fort Macquarie and Dawes Point, constructed further fortifications at Kirribilli and Mrs Macquarie's Chair, and finished Fort Denison. Dawes Point received additional subterranean powder magazines and the Royal Artillery provided a garrison. Dawes Point Battery also became the command post for the fortifications around the inner harbor. Colonel George Barney was given the task renovating Sydney's fortifications and an extension of Dawes Point in 1860. Sydney's Harbour defences had been relocated to the entrance of Port Jackson by the end of the 19th century, thus rendering Dawes Point obsolete. The battery was then used to store the Commandant of the Australian Military from 1901 and 1903. Most of the fort was demolished in 1925 to make way for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. In 1932 the remaining buildings that served as a headquarters for Dorman and Long, the British company responsible for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge were demolished and the whole area landscaped and set aside for public use. In 1995 archaeological investigations were carried out at the Battery site, and the findings were incorporated into a new interpretive park which was opened to the public in 2001. The park was named \\"Dawes PointTarra\\" acknowledging the Cadigal name for the area.  Description  The archaeological remains of the Dawes Point Battery (1791-1925) have been excavated during the past few years. They include the floor of the original powder magazine, the circular battery with evidence of 4 gun emplacements (5th emplacement probably under the path), underground magazines, a stone ramp and the footings of the officers' quarters. Five 42-pounder cannons, muzzle loading, one on replica wooden carriage installed on an original emplacement the other four are not in situ and without carriages. Manufactured in 1843-1844, as indicated by date stamps on metal work.AM037; AM086; AM092-093 Built by 1788. = Condition = As at 3 November 2000, the first known building on the site was Dawes' observatory built in early 1788. A powder magazine was constructed in 1789 followed by the Battery in 1791. It was expanded substantially in 1819. Further buildings were constructed in the 1850s and at the end of the century. The site had also been used as a cemetery for prisoners executed at Old Sydney Gaol (1797-). All buildings were levelled between 1925 and 1932 during the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The archaeological remains revealed to date are unparalleled in Australia because they represent a broad range of significant historical periods. Archaeological sites from the 18th century are exceedingly rare with only the remains of First Government House and parts of the Dockyard on the western side of the Cove bearing witness to the first 10 years of white settlement in the Sydney CBD. Only a handful of the colonial architect Francis Greenway's structures survive. With the excavation of the semi-circular battery floor an interesting part of his work has been rediscovered. Greenway's quarry on the site is a good example of the careful mining of stone from this period in Sydney. The archaeology of the Battery floor and underground magazines also reveals elements constructed under the direction of George Barney, one of Australia's most important Colonial Engineers in the mid 19th century, such as the 1850s gun emplacements. Together with the presence of movable heritage associated with the site, the Battery is an important archive of military history. The archaeological remains also have a strong aesthetic appeal as evocative ruins of Australia's colonial past.

The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The post 1788 archaeological remains at Dawes Point revealed to date are extremely important for their research potential. Such archaeological sites from the 18th century are exceedingly rare with the remains of First Government House and parts of the Dockyard on the western side of the Cove being some of the few examples bearing witness to the first 10 years of white settlement at Sydney Cove. Only a handful of the colonial architect Francis Greenway's structures survive. With the excavation of the semi-circular battery an interesting part of his work has been rediscovered. Likewise, Greenway's quarry on the site is the only example of the careful mining of stone from this period in Sydney. The archaeology of the Battery floor and underground magazines also reveals elements constructed under the direction of George Barney, one of Australia's most important Colonial Engineers in the mid 19th century, such as the 1850s gun emplacements. Together with the presence of the cannon from this time, on their original timber block supports the Battery is an important archive of military history. The archaeological remains also have a strong aesthetic appeal as evocative ruins of Australia's colonial past. Dawes Point is important for its cultural values to several identifiable groups within NSW society including present and former residents of The Rocks and Millers Point; people involved in the fight to save the Rocks in the 1970s; descendants of the many artillerymen and their families who were stationed at Dawes Point; and Bridge construction and maintenance workers, their families and descendants. Dawes Point, as a setting for the Harbour Bridge, is valued for its aesthetic and engineering significance by several identifiable groups including the Institution of Engineers (Australia) and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects The 1789 Foundation Stone (now with the Mitchell Collection in the NSW State Library) and the five 1850s cannon contribute strongly to the heritage significance of the Place, in addition to being significant in their own right. Dawes Point maintains vestiges of all periods of its occupation. The Point has been terraced and filled with each successive land use. All of these land uses have been closely linked with the site's unique position, occupying as it does a prominent headland with vistas up and down the harbour. Dawes Point Park still encompasses more than 90% of the area set aside for military purposes in the 18th century. Very little of this area has been alienated from public use, allowing the potential for interpretation of this period of the site's history in particular. The layers of history at Dawes Point have great potential to be used as a rich educational, cultural and tourism resource. The excavation, conservation and interpretation of the Dawes Point Battery remains has won several prestigious awards since 2001, indicating the historical, social, technical and research significance the place holds, not only for the public, but also for professional bodies.

It is visible for miles from the surrounding area and Long Island Sound. The monument was completed in 1887 and honors the residents of New Haven who gave their lives in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the Civil War. It is high and 87 steps to the top. History Interest in the monument began as early as 1878, when the New Haven-based Admiral Hull Foote Post of the Grand Army of the Republic began lobbying citizens for a large war memorial in New Haven, and a site on the New Haven Green was dedicated in the following year. A committee and funds for the monument were formed in an 1882 town meeting, but objections about the high number of GAR members in attendance prompted litigation that stalled the project. In 1883, the monument committee advertised a design competition for the monument. At least 15 designs were submitted, including one by Alexander Doyle and John M. Moffit after the deadline. The committee also solicited designs from George Keller and Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who each had designed several well-known Civil War memorials, but both declined to submit proposals. In 1884, the monument's site was moved to East Rock after the city council decided to retain the defunct Connecticut State House, causing further delays. Two years after the original solicitation, a neoclassical design by Moffit & Doyle was selected, including an observatory, bronze statuary, and red granite shaft. Work was undertaken in 1886 by New Haven firm Smith & Sperry, with the bronze casting completed by the Ames Manufacturing Company and the Decorative Bronze Company. The monument was dedicated on June 17, 1887, with 175,000 people in attendance at the ceremony and parade, including Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Henry Sheridan as guests of honor.

Function  This gene is a member of the MutL-homolog (MLH) family of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. MLH genes are implicated in maintaining genomic integrity during DNA replication and after meiotic recombination. The protein encoded by this gene functions as a heterodimer with other family members. Somatic mutations in this gene frequently occur in tumors exhibiting microsatellite instability, and germline mutations have been linked to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer type 7 (HNPCC7). Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but the full- length nature of only two transcript variants has been determined. Orthologs of human MLH3 have also been studied in other organisms including mouse and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Meiosis In addition to its role in DNA mismatch repair, MLH3 protein is also involved in meiotic crossing over. MLH3 forms a heterodimer with MLH1 that appears to be necessary for mouse oocytes to progress through metaphase II of meiosis. A current model of meiotic recombination, initiated by a double-strand break or gap, followed by pairing with an homologous chromosome and strand invasion to initiate the recombinational repair process. Repair of the gap can lead to crossover (CO) or non-crossover (NCO) of the flanking regions. CO recombination is thought to occur by the Double Holliday Junction (DHJ) model, illustrated on the right, above. NCO recombinants are thought to occur primarily by the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) model, illustrated on the left, above. Most recombination events appear to be the SDSA type. The MLH1-MLH3 heterodimers promote crossovers. Recombination during meiosis is often initiated by a DNA double-strand break (DSB) as illustrated in the accompanying diagram. During recombination, sections of DNA at the 5' ends of the break are cut away in a process called resection. In the strand invasion step that follows, an overhanging 3' end of the broken DNA molecule then \\"invades\\" the DNA of a homologous chromosome that is not broken forming a displacement loop (D-loop). After strand invasion, the further sequence of events may follow either of two main pathways leading to a crossover (CO) or a non-crossover (NCO) recombinant (see Genetic recombination. The pathway leading to a CO involves a double Holliday junction (DHJ) intermediate. Holliday junctions need to be resolved for CO recombination to be completed. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as in the mouse, MLH3 forms a heterodimer with MLH1. Meiotic CO requires resolution of Holliday junctions through actions of the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer. The MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer is an endonuclease that makes single- strand breaks in supercoiled double-stranded DNA. MLH1-MLH3 binds specifically to Holliday junctions and may act as part of a larger complex to process Holliday junctions during meiosis. MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer (MutL gamma) together with Exo1 and Sgs1 (ortholog of Bloom syndrome helicase) define a joint molecule resolution pathway that produces the majority of crossovers in budding yeast and, by inference, in mammals.  Interactions  MLH3 has been shown to interact with MSH4.

CARP is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and is a transcription factor involved in development and under conditions of stress. CARP has been implicated in several diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and several skeletal muscle myopathies. Structure Human CARP is a 36.2kDa protein composed of 319 amino acids., though in cardiomyocytes, CARP can exist as multiple alternatively spliced forms. CARP contains five tandem ankyrin repeats. Studies have shown that CARP can homodimerize. Studies have also shown that CARP is N-terminally, post- translationally cleaved by calpain-3 in skeletal muscle, suggesting alternate bioactive forms of CARP exist. CARP has been localized to nuclei and Z-discs in animal and human myocytes, and at intercalated discs in human cells.  Function  CARP was originally identified as a YB-1-associating, cardiac- restricted transcription co-repressor in the homeobox NKX2-5 pathway that is involved in cardiac ventricular chamber specification, maturation and morphogenesis, and whose mRNA levels are exquisitely sensitive to Doxorubicin, mediated through a hydrogen peroxide/ERK/p38MAP kinase-dependent as well as M-CAT cis-element-dependent mechanism. Subsequent studies showed that CARP expression in cardiomyocytes is regulated by alpha-adrenergic signaling, in part via the transcription factor GATA4. An additional study showed that beta- adrenergic signaling via protein kinase A and CaM kinase induces the expression of CARP, and that CARP may have a negative effect on contractile function. CARP has also been identified as a transcriptional co-activator of tumor suppressor protein p53 for stimulating gene expression in muscle; p53 was found to be an upstream effector of CARP via upregulation of the proximal ANKRD1 promoter. CARP has a relatively short half-life being longer in cardiomyocytes than endothelial cells; and CARP is degraded by the 26S proteasome via a PEST degron. In animal models of disease and injury, CARP has been characterized to be a stress-inducible myofibrillar protein. CARP has been shown to play a role in skeletal muscle structure remodeling, and repair, being expressed in skeletal muscle near myotendinous junctions, and in vascular smooth muscle cells, as a downstream target of TGF-beta/Smad sigmaling in response to balloon injury and atherosclerotic plaques. Further studies have identified a role for CARP in initiation and regulation of arteriogenesis. Decreased expression of CARP in cardiac cells within the ischemic region was detected in a rat model of ischemic injury, and was thought to be linked to the induction of GADD153, an apoptosis-related gene. In cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin, a model of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, CARP mRNA and protein levels were depleted, myofilament gene transcription was attenuated and sarcomeres showed significant disarray. In a transgenic mouse model of cardiac-specific overexpression of CARP, mice exhibited normal physiology at baseline, but were protected against pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced via pressure-overload or isoproterenol, which could be attributed to the downregulation of the ERK1/2, MEK and TGFbeta-1 pathways. Another study demonstrated that adenoviral overexpression of CARP in cardiomyocytes enhances cardiac hypertrophy induced by Angiotensin II or pressure-overload and promotoes cardiomyocyte apoptosis via p53 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, transgenic knockout models of either CARP alone or CARP in combination with the other muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs), ANKRD2 and ANKRD23 demonstrated a lack of cardiac phenotype; mice displayed normal cardiac function at baseline and in response to pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that these proteins are not essential. Interactions between CARP and the sarcomeric proteins myopalladin and titin suggest that it may also be involved in the myofibrillar stretch-sensor system. Passive stretch in fetal cardiomyocytes induced differential CARP distribution at nuclei and I-band titin N2A regions. In a mouse model of muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) caused by a small deletion in titin, CARP mRNA expression was shown to be 30-fold elevated in skeletal muscle tissue.  Clinical significance  A wide spectrum of clinical features have been associated with ANKRD1/CARP. Mutations in ANKRD1 have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, two of which result in altered binding with TLN1 and FHL2. Mutations in ANKRD1 have also been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and have shown to increase binding of CARP to Titin and MYPN. Examination of the functional effects of CARP hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in engineered heart tissue demonstrated that Thr123Met was a gain-of-function mutation exhibiting augmented contractile properties; whereas Pro52Ala and Ile280Val were unstable and failed to incorporate into sarcomeres, an effect that was remedied upon proteasome inhibition via epoxomicin. A missense mutation in ANKRD1 was shown to be associated with the congenital heart defect, Anomalous pulmonary venous connection. CARP has been found as a sensitive and specific biomarker for the differential diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. ANKRD1 mRNA levels correlate with patient platinum sensitivity, thus ANKRD1 associates with platinum-based chemotherapy treatment outcome in ovarian adenocarcinoma patients. CARP and mRNA expression has been shown to be upregulated in left ventricles of heart failure patients. Studies in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and congenital myopathy, also found altered expression of CARP in skeletal muscle fibers. Another study in congenital muscular dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients showed elevated expression of CARP. CARP expression is also elevated in patients with lupus nephritis, and associates with proteinuria severity, suggesting that it may have biomarker potential.

DcpS uses cap dinucleotides or capped oligonucleotides as substrates to release m(7)GMP (N7-methyl GMP), while Dcp2 uses capped mRNA as a substrate in order to hydrolyse the cap to release m(7)GDP (N7-methyl GDP). The association of DcpS with 3' to 5' exonuclease exosome components suggests that these two activities are linked and there is a coupled exonucleolytic decay-dependent decapping pathway. The family contains a histidine triad (HIT) sequence in its C-terminal domain, with three histidines separated by hydrophobic residues.

It is found to stimulate the export of U1 snRNA in RAN- and CRM1-dependent pathways and the export of tRNA and mRNA in a CRM1-independent pathway. The encoded protein heterodimerizes with Tap protein and may regulate the ability of Tap protein to mediate nuclear mRNA export. The use of alternate polyadenylation sites has been found for this gene.

It is one of several film adaptations of the 1934 play The Red Cat by Rudolf Lothar and Hans Adler. Others are Folies Berg√®re de Paris (1935) and On the Riviera (1951). The original songs for the film were written by the musical partnership of Harry Warren and Mack Gordon. These include: \\"Boa Noite\\", \\"They Met in Rio (A Midnight Serenade)\\", \\"Chica Chica Boom Chic\\" and \\"I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi (I Like You Very Much)\\". Plot Larry Martin (Don Ameche) is an American entertainer in the Casino Samba in Rio de Janeiro. He has a skit in his show, making fun of the womanizing Baron Manuel Duarte (also Ameche). On one particular evening, the Baron and his wife, Baroness Cecilia Duarte (Alice Faye) come to see Larry's impersonation. To the surprise of the couple, the act is amazingly realistic. Backstage, the Baron meets Larry's girlfriend, Carmen (Carmen Miranda), and invites her to a party he is going to hold. Carmen declines. Later in the evening, Larry meets Cecilia and is attracted to her singing and her beauty. He does an impersonation of the Baron for her. But the real Baron receives a telegram that his airline is in danger because a contract is not being renewed and he has already purchased 51% of the stock. Needing money to repay the bank he borrowed it from, he flies down to Buenos Aires. Larry is hired to play the Baron to confuse his rival, Machado (J. Carrol Naish), but at the stock market, he buys the remainder of the airline stock. That evening, at the party, Larry is hired again to play the Baron. He does not want the Baroness to know, but Cecilia is informed without his knowing. He sweeps her off her feet and they stay close to each other for the remainder of the evening. Meanwhile, Carmen is furious to discover that Larry is at the party and decides to go there as well, where she discovers that he is impersonating the Baron. To make matter worse, the real Baron returns to his house, confusing all involved. Machado corners Larry instead and talks to him in French, which Larry can't understand. After the party, the Baron discovers that Cecilia was flirting with Larry for the evening and tries to play the joke on her. She, however, inadvertently turns the tables on him. To get back at his wife, the next morning, the Baron calls and tells Cecilia that his plane has just landed. Cecilia fears that she has been unfaithful to Manuel but Larry later tells her the truth. At the office, Machado gives the Baron a payment of $32 million for his airline, the topic of his conversation with Larry. The Baron heads home but Cecilia tries one more time to get back at him by pretending to make violent love to Larry. It turns out to be the Baron and all is soon resolved in the end.

Hal Leonard Corporation page 101 The movie's working titles were \\"A Latin from Manhattan\\", \\"Rings on Her Fingers\\", \\"They Met in Rio\\" and \\"The Road to Rio\\". According to The Hollywood Reporter of November 15, 1940, Paramount objected to the proposed title The Road to Rio because it created confusion with that studio's Road to Zanzibar starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. That Night in Rio marked the sixth and final teaming of Don Ameche and Alice Faye, one of Fox's most popular teams. Faye and Ameche recorded and filmed the song \\"Chica Chica Boom Chic\\" as a dance number, but only the sequence of Miranda and Ameche singing the song is in the released picture. Irving Cummings directed the screenplay by George Seaton, Bess Meredyth and Hal Long. According to a letter from studio head Darryl F. Zanuck, the script for That Night in Rio had been submitted to the Brazilian Ambassador in Washington, D.C., who approved it and described it as \\"the kind of picture that will be helpful to North and South America relations.\\" A report in the MPAA/PCA filed noted that the picture was rejected for distribution in Ireland, although no reason was given.

In a strategy similar to the embargo against Cuba, it was intended to undermine the Sandanista government which came to power in 1979. Embargo The embargo both forbade American products from entering Nicaragua (with exceptions for medicine and other humanitarian goods) and Nicaraguan products from entering the United States. It further banned all Nicaraguan ships from landing in any U.S. port or planes from landing on U.S. soil. Ronald Reagan, on the day he declared the embargo, stated: \\"I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, find that the policies and actions of the Government of Nicaragua constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.\\" Reagan made four demands against Nicaragua during his embargo announcement: # To \\"halt its export of armed insurrection, terrorism, and subversion in neighboring countries.\\" # To end its military ties to Cuba and the Soviet Union # To cease its \\"massive arms buildup\\" # To adhere, in law and practice, to democratic principles and \\"observance of full political and human rights.\\" Violations of international law In 1986 the embargo was found to be in violation of international law by the International Court of Justice. The court's ruling states that the embargo was \\"in breach of obligations under Article XIX of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the Parties signed at Managua on 21 January 1956\\". This Treaty states that \\"neither party shall impose restrictions or prohibitions on the importation of any product of the other party, or on the exportation of any product to the territories of the other party.\\" Further, by laying mines in Nicaraguan waters to enforce the embargo, the United States of America also violated \\"its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another State\\". The United States was therefore obligated \\"to cease and to refrain from all such acts\\" and pay an unspecified amount in reparations to Nicaragua. However, the United States continued the embargo nearly 4 years after the ruling, and did not pay reparations. Embargo extension The embargo was extended for six months by George H. W.

Isocitrate dehydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. These enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses, one of which utilizes NAD(+) as the electron acceptor and the other NADP(+). Five isocitrate dehydrogenases have been reported: three NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, which localize to the mitochondrial matrix, and two NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic. Each NADP(+)-dependent isozyme is a homodimer. The protein encoded by the IDH2 gene is the NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase found in the mitochondria. It plays a role in intermediary metabolism and energy production. This protein may tightly associate or interact with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Somatic mosaic mutations of this gene have also been found associated to Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome.  Structure  Isocitrate dehydrogenase is composed of 3 subunits, allosterically regulated, and requires an integrated Mg2+ or Mn2+ ion. The mitochondrial form of IDH, like most isoforms, is a homodimer, in which two identical monomer subunits form one unit. The structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis IDH-1 bound with NADPH and Mn2+ has been solved by X-ray crystallography. It is a homodimer in which each subunit has a Rossmann fold, and a common top domain of interlocking Œ≤ sheets. Mtb IDH-1 is most structurally similar to the R132H mutant human IDH found in certain glioblastomas. Similar to human R132H ICDH, Mtb ICDH-1 also catalyzes the formation of Œ±-hydroxyglutarate.  Function  Isocitrate dehydrogenase is a digestive enzyme that is used in the citric acid cycle. Its main function is to catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate. Human isocitrate dehydrogenase regulation is not fully understood however, it is known that NADP and Ca2+ bind in the active site to create three different conformations. These conformations form in the active site and are as follows: a loop is form in the inactive enzyme, a partially unraveled alpha helix in the semi open form, and an alpha helix in the active form.  Clinical significance  The mitochondrial form of IDH2 is correlated with many diseases. Mutations in IDH2 are associated with 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, a condition that causes progressive damage to the brain. The major types of this disorder are called D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA), L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA), and combined D,L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D,L-2-HGA). The main features of D-2-HGA are delayed development, seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and abnormalities in the largest part of the brain (the cerebrum), which controls many important functions such as muscle movement, speech, vision, thinking, emotion, and memory. Researchers have described two subtypes of D-2-HGA, type I and type II. The two subtypes are distinguished by their genetic cause and pattern of inheritance, although they also have some differences in signs and symptoms. Type II tends to begin earlier and often causes more severe health problems than type I. Type II may also be associated with a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), a feature that is typically not found with type I. L-2-HGA particularly affects a region of the brain called the cerebellum, which is involved in coordinating movements. As a result, many affected individuals have problems with balance and muscle coordination (ataxia). Additional features of L-2-HGA can include delayed development, seizures, speech difficulties, and an unusually large head (macrocephaly). Typically, signs and symptoms of this disorder begin during infancy or early childhood. The disorder worsens over time, usually leading to severe disability by early adulthood. Combined D,L-2-HGA causes severe brain abnormalities that become apparent in early infancy. Affected infants have severe seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and breathing and feeding problems. They usually survive only into infancy or early childhood. Mutations in the IDH2 gene, along with mutations in the IDH1 gene, are also strongly correlated with the development of glioma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chondrosarcoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma cancers. They also cause D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria and Ollier and Maffucci syndromes. IDH2 mutations may allow prolonged survival of glioma and ICC cancer cells, but not AML cells. The reason for this is unknown. Missense mutations in the active site of these IDH2 induce a neo-enzymatic reaction wherein NADPH reduces Œ±KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which accumulates and leads to the inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1Œ± (HIF1Œ±) degradation (inhibition of the HIF prolyl-hydroxylase), as well as changes in epigenetics and extracellular matrix homeostasis. Such mutations also imply less NADPH production capacity. Tumors of various tissue types with IDH1/2 mutations show improved responses to radiation and chemotherapy. Inhibitors of the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 are currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for both solid and blood tumors. As IDH1 and IDH2 represent key enzymes within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, mutations have significant impact on intermediary metabolism. The loss of some wild-type metabolic activity is an important, potentially deleterious and therapeutically exploitable consequence of oncogenic IDH mutations and requires continued investigation in the future.

Function  Immunoglobulins recognize foreign antigens and initiate immune responses such as phagocytosis and the complement system. Each immunoglobulin molecule consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. There are two classes of light chains, kappa and lambda. This region represents the germline organization of the lambda light chain locus. The locus includes V (variable), J (joining), and C (constant) segments. During B cell development, a recombination event at the DNA level joins a single V segment with a J segment; the C segment is later joined by splicing at the RNA level. Recombination of many different V segments with several J segments provides a wide range of antigen recognition. Additional diversity is attained by junctional diversity, resulting from the random additional of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and by somatic hypermutation, which occurs during B cell maturation in the spleen and lymph nodes.

The protein was detected in and purified from cultures of Phytohaemagglutinin-activated human T-cell leukemia SKW-3 cells. Subsequent studies have defined LECT2 as a hepatokine, i.e. a substance made and released into the circulation by liver hepatocyte cells that regulates the function of other cells: it is a hepatocyte-derived, hormone-like, signaling protein. LECT2 has been detected in the blood and other tissues in a wide range of animal species from zebrafish to man. Furthermore, its levels in these tissues often change as a function of various diseases. These findings indicate that LECT is an evolutionary conserved protein, has one or more important functions, and may be involved in various diseases. However, LECT2's relationships to these diseases requires much further study before they can be regarded as established and clinically useful. One exception to this, however, is its proven role in amyloidosis. LECT2 is one of the more common causes of systemic (as opposed to localized) amyloidosis in North America as well as certain other ethnically-rich locations. LECT2 and its gene, LECT2, are currently areas of active research that seek to implicate them as contributors to, markers for the presence of, and/or prognostic indicators for the severity of not only amyloidosis but also osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other types of inflammation-related disorders; the metabolic syndrome and diabetes; and various types of liver disease.  Gene  The human LECT2 gene, LECT2, is located on the long, i.e, \\"q\\", arm of chromosome 5 at position q31.1 (notated as 5q31.1). This location is close to several immune modulating genes including interleukins 3, 5, and 9 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. LECT2 is conserved in zebrafish, chichen, rat, mouse, cow. dog, Rhesus monkey, and chimpanzee. Human LECT2 is composed of 4 exons, 3 introns, and ~8,000 base pairs. The gene has numerous single nucleotide variants as well as other variations, some of which have been associated with human disease. Human LECT2 has several different transcriptional initiation sights and codes for a mRNA composed of 1,000 to 1,300 ribonucleotides. mRNA for LECT2 is highly expressed in liver tissue and expressed at far lower levels in a wide range of other tssues. Protein  Human LECT2 is a secreted, 16 kilodalton protein. The secreted protein consists of 133\`amino acids (mouse Lect2 consists of two varieties a typical 151 amino acid protein and an atypical 132 amino acid protein). Its structure is similar to that of the M23 family of metalloendopeptidases. Unlike this family of peptidases, however, LECT2 has not been found to possess enzymatic activity and does not appear to share any functions with M23 metalloendopeptidases. LECT2 protein is widely expressed in vascular tissues, smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, cerebral neurons, apical squamous epithelia, parathyroid tissues, the epithelial cells of sweat and sebaceous glands, Hassall bodies, and monocytes. When these cells or tissues are subjected to inflammatory, fibrotic, and other insults, they commonly reduce their expression of LECT2. The liver hepatocyte is considered to be the source of the LECT2 circulating in blood. However, its expression in these cells is extremely low or undetectable even though these cells express very high levels of LECT2 mRNA. This implies that hepatocytes secrete LECT2 almost immediately after they make it. Using very sensitive methods, LECT2 protein can also be detected at low levels in the endothelial cells of hepatic arteries and veins including central veins. Several cell types or tissues, e.g. osteoblasts, chondrocytes, cardiac tissue, gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells of some tissues normally do not express LECT2 but do so under a variety of disease conditions.  Disease associations  = LECT2 amyloidosis = LECT2 amyloidosis (ALECT2) was the third most common (~3% of total) cause of amyloidosis in a series of >4,000 individuals studied at the Mayo Clinic in the United States. However, LECT2 amyloidosis has a strong ethnic bias, afflicting particularly Mexicans and to a lesser extent, non-Mexican Hispanics. Hispanics made an important contribution to the Mayo Clinic's rate of LECT2 amyloidosis. LECT2 amyloidosis also has an increased incidence in Punjabis, South Asians, First Nations people of British Columbia, Native Americans, and Egyptians. In Egyptians, LECT2 is second most common cause of renal amyloidosis, accounting for nearly 31% of all cases. LECT2 amyloidosis is likely to be a far less common cause of systemic amyloidosis in populations containing fewer numbers of individuals of the cited ethnic groups. On the other hand, LECT2 amyloidosis represents an important but at present very much under-recognized cause of chronic kidney disease in the cited ethnic groups and, possibly, other ethnic groups yet to be deteremined. It has been found repeatedly that the mere presence of LECT2 amyloid tissue deposits does not necessarily indicate the presence of LECT2 amyloidosis disease. For example, autopsy studies find that up to 3.1% of Hispanics have these deposits in their kidneys but no history of signs or symptoms that could be attributed to LECT2 amyloidosis. This finding suggests that the LECT2 amyloidosis and its ethnic bias reflect multiple poorly understood factors.  Pathophysiology  While the pathogenesis of LECT2 amyloidosis is unclear, the intact LECT2 protein may have a tendency to fold abnormally thereby forming non-soluble fibrils that are deposited in tissues. It has been suggested that individuals with the disease have an increase in LECT2 production and/or a decrease in LECT2 catabolism (i.e. breakdown) which leads to its tissue deposition. However, there appears to be clear genetic variations which lead LECT2 tissue deposition. While studies to date have failed to obtain evidence for LECT2 gene mutations in the disorder, most cases examined in the United States are associated with a particular homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (i.e. SNP) in the LECT2 gene. This SNP occurs in exon 3 at codon 58 of the gene, contains a guanine rather than adenine nucleotide at this site, and consequently codes for the amino acid valine rather than isoleucine. It is suggested although not yet proven that this Val58Ile variant of LECT2 has a propensity to fold abnormally and therefore deposits in tissues. The Val58Ile LECT2 variant is common in Hispanics and appears to be the cause of their high incidence of LECT2 amyloidosis. Nonetheless, not all homozygous carriers of the variant ever exhibit LECT2 amyloidosis. A second SNP commonly found in Mexicans occurs at codon 172 of the LECT2 gene. This variant is homozygous for a G nucleotide at this codon position and has been associated with an increased incidence of LECT2 amyloidosis. A reason for this association has not yet been proposed.  Presentation  LECT2 amyloidosis presents with renal disease that in general is slowly progressive and at the time of presentation is of varying severity ranging from early findings of proteinuria or small elevations in blood urea nitrogen and/or creatinine to findings of end stage renal disease. At presentation, many individuals are elderly and suffer serious kidney dysfunction. They may have histological evidence of LECT2 amyloid deposition in the liver, lung, spleen, kidney, and adrenal glands of rarely show any symptoms or signs attributable to dysfunction in these organs. Unlike many other forms of systemic amyloidosis, LECT2 deposition has not been reported to be deposited in the myocardium or brain of afflicted individuals. Thus, LECT2 amyloidosis, while classified as a form of systemic amyloidosis, is almost exclusively manifested clinically as renal amyloidosis.  Diagnosis  LECT amyloidosis is diagnosed by two findings: a) histological evidence of Congo red staining material deposited in the interstitial, mesangial, glomerular, and/or vascular areas of the kidney and b) the identification of these deposits as containing mainly LECT2 as identified by proteomics methodologies. Kidney biopsy shows the presence of LECT2-based amyloid predominantly in the renal cortex interstitium, glomeruli, and arterioles.  Treatment  There has too little experience on the treatment of LECT2 amyloidosis (ALECT2) to establish recommendations. There is no recommended specific treatment for LECT2 amyloidosis other than support of kidney function and dialysis. It is important to accurately diagnose ALECT2-based amyloid disease in order to avoid treatment for other forms of amyloidosis.  Prognosis  Based on studies conducted in the United States, the prognosis for individuals with LECT2 amyloidosis is guarded, particularly because they are elderly and their kidney disease is usually well-advanced at the time of presentation. = Rheumatoid arthritis = Studies conducted in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis indicate that the LECT2 protein suppresses the inflammatory component of this disorder. In human studies, the Val58Ile variant of LECT2 protein which has been associated with the development of LECT2 amyloidosis in Hispanics has also been associated with rheumatoid arthritis. That is, individuals homozygous for the gene making the Val58Ile variant of LECT2 have a small but significant increase in both the incidence and severity of this disease based on a study conducted in Japan. An increase in the severity and joint destruction of rheumatoid arthritis in humans was confirmed in a separate study conducted in Germany. These studies suggest that LECT2 normally functions to suppress the development and/or severity of human rheumatoid arthritis and that the Val58Ile variant of LECT2 is less effective in doing so. = Osteoarthritis = In a model of osteoarthritis, mice made deficient in LECT2 using a gene knockout method developed more severe osteoarthritis induced by anti-type II collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide. The effect was reversed by administering human LECT2 to the animals. A study conducted in Japan found that the expression levels of LECT2 were significantly higher in cartilage of osteoarthritic individuals than in control patients suggesting that LECT2 may be a useful biomarker for the disease. = Sepsis = In mouse models of bacterial sepsis caused by of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and ligation followed by puncture of the cecum, the administration of human LECT2 improved survival. LECTT2 acted by directly stimulating the CD209 receptor on mouse macrophages thereby mobilizing their protective functions. Knockout of the Lect2 gene in mice increase the mortality caused by staphylococcal enterotoxin A; human LECT2 reduced this morality increase. Blood levels of LECT2 in patients suffering bacterial sepsis correlated inversely with the severity of systemic inflammation suggesting that LECT2 blood levels may be a reliable diagnostic indicator of human inflammatory diseases. = Diabetes = Deletion of the Lect2 gene in mice improves peripheral glucose entry into tissues. These studies suggest that mouse Lect2 suppresses insulin signaling in skeletal muscle but not adipose or liver tissues of Lect2-deficient mice and thereby may contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Indeed, serum levels of LECT2 are increased in animal models of insulin-resistant diabetes as well as in individual diabetics demonstrating insulin resistance. These data suggest that inhibiting LECT2 production or action may be clinically useful means for treating diabetes. In support of this notion, Gemigliptin, an anti- diabetic drug, has been shown reduce insulin resistance and concurrently inhibit Lect2 production in a mouse model of dietary-induces insulin resistance. Studies conducted on cultured myocytes, a form of muscle cell, indicates that LECT2 impairs insulin signaling by activating a c-Jun N-terminal kinases cell signaling pathway. = Metabolic syndrome = Mice made deficient in the Lect2 gene were compared to wild-type mice in a model of high fatty acid diet-induced obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Lect2-deficient mice appeared to be protected from developing certain characteristics of the metabolic syndrome: they exhibited less weight gain; lower blood glucose and insulin levels following feeding; and better results for glucose and insulin tolerance tests. In a study of 200 individuals in Japan, serum LECT2 levels correlated positively with (i.e. increased in proportion to increases in) several clinical features of the metabolic syndrome viz., body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, selenoprotein P serum levels, and hemoglobin A1c blood levels. Levels of LECT2 are also elevated in individuals not only with diagnosed metabolic syndrome but also with a characteristic of and possible precursor to the metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. LEPT2 has been suggested to be a potential therapeutic target for treating the metabolic syndrome. = Cancer = Circulating levels of LECT2 are elevated in >90% of individuals with hepatoblastoma and >20% of individuals with Hepatocellular carcinoma. In the latter form of liver cancer, LECT2 levels increase with increasingly poor prognostic stages of the disease and therefore may prove to be valuable prognostic markers.

It belongs to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) superfamily. Like many other members of this superfamily it is involved in cell differentiation in early embryogenesis, playing a key role in signal transfer from the node, in the anterior primitive streak, to lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Nodal signaling is important very early in development for mesoderm and endoderm formation and subsequent organization of left-right axial structures. In addition, Nodal seems to have important functions in neural patterning, stem cell maintenance and many other developmental processes, including left/right handedness.  Signaling  Nodal can bind type I and type II Serine/Threonine kinase receptors, with Cripto-1 acting as its co-receptor. Signaling through SMAD 2/3 and subsequent translocation of SMAD 4 to the nucleus promotes the expression of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation. Nodal also further activates its own expression via a positive feedback loop. It is tightly regulated by inhibitors Lefty A, Lefty B, Cerberus, and Tomoregulin-1, which can interfere with Nodal receptor binding.  Species specific Nodal Ligands  Nodal is a widely distributed cytokine. The presence of Nodal is not limited to vertebrates, it is also known to be conserved in other deuterostomes (cephalochordates, tunicates and echinoderms) and protostomes such as snails, but neither the nematode C. elegans (another protosome) nor the fruit fly Drosophila (an arthropod) have a copy of nodal. Although mouse and human only have one nodal gene, the zebrafish contain three nodal paralogs: squint , cyclops and southpaw, and the frog five (xnr1,2,3,5 and 6). Even though the zebrafish Nodal homologs are very similar, they have specialized to perform different roles; for instance, Squint and Cyclops are important for mesoendoderm formation, whereas the Southpaw has a major role in asymmetric heart morphogenesis and visceral left-right asymmetry. Another example of protein speciation is the case of the frog where Xnr1 and Xnr2 regulate movements in gastrulation in contrast to Xnr5 and Xnr6 that are involved in mesoderm induction. In mouse, Nodal has been implicated in left-right asymmetry, neural pattering and mesoderm induction (see nodal signaling).  Functions  Nodal signaling regulates mesoderm formation in a species-specific manner. Thus, in Xenopus, Xnr controls dorso-ventral mesoderm formation along the marginal zone. In zebrafish, Squint and Cyclops are responsible for animal-vegetal mesoderm formation. In chicken and mouse, Vg1 and Nodal respectively promote primitive streak formation in the epiblast. In chick development, Nodal is expressed in Koller's sickle. Studies have shown that a nodal knockout in mouse causes the absence of the primitive streak and failure in the formation of mesoderm, leading to developmental arrest just after gastrulation. Compared to mesoderm specification, endoderm specification requires a higher expression of Nodal. Here, Nodal stimulates mixer homeoproteins, which can interact with SMADs in order to up-regulate endoderm specific genes and repress mesoderm specific genes. Left-right (LR) asymmetry of visceral organs in vertebrates is also established through nodal signaling. Whereas Nodal is initially symmetrically expressed in the embryo, after gastrulation, Nodal becomes asymmetrically restricted to the left side of the organism. It is highly conserved among deuterostomes. An ortholog of Nodal was found in snails and was shown to be involved in left-right asymmetry as well in 2008. In order to enable anterior neural tissue development, Nodal signaling needs to be repressed after inducing mesendoderm and LR symmetry. Recent research on mouse and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) indicates that Nodal seems to be involved in the maintenance of stem cell self-renewal and pluripotent potentials. Thus, overexpression of Nodal in hESCs lead to the repression of cell differentiation. On the contrary, inhibition of Nodal and Activin signaling enabled the differentiation of hESCs.

History The Lake Palace was built between 1743 and 1746 under the direction of the Maharana Jagat Singh II (62nd successor to the royal dynasty of Mewar) of Udaipur, Rajasthan as a summer palace. It was initially called Jagniwas or Jan Niwas after its founder. The palace was constructed facing east, allowing its inhabitants to pray to Surya, the Hindu sun god, at the crack of dawn. The successive rulers used this palace as their summer resort, holding their regal durbars in its courtyards lined with columns, pillared terraces, fountains, and gardens. The walls made of black and white marbles are adorned by semi-precious stones and ornamented niches. Gardens, fountains, pillared terraces and columns line its courtyards. The upper room is a perfect circle and is about in diameter. Its floor is inlaid with black and white marble, the walls are ornamented with niches and decorated with arabesques of colored stones, the dome is exquisitely beautiful in form. During the famous Indian Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, several European families fled from Nimach and used the island as an asylum, offered to them by Maharana Swaroop Singh. To protect his guests, the Rana destroyed all the town's boats so that the rebels could not reach the island. By the latter half of the 19th century, time and weather took their toll on the extraordinary water palaces of Udaipur. Pierre Loti, a French writer, described Jag Niwas as \\"slowly moldering in the damp emanations of the lake.\\" About the same time bicyclists Fanny Bullock Workman and her husband William Hunter Workman were distressed by the 'cheap and tasteless style' of the interiors of the water palaces with \\"an assortment of infirm European furniture, wooden clocks, coloured glass ornaments, and children's toys, all of which seems to the visitor quite out of place, where he would naturally expect a dignified display of Eastern splendor.\\" The reign of Maharana Sir Bhopal Singh (1930‚Äì55) saw the addition of another pavilion, Chandra Prakash, but otherwise the Jag Niwas remained unaltered and decaying. Geoffrey Kendal, the theater personality, described the palace during his visit in the 1950s as \\"totally deserted, the stillness broken only by the humming of clouds of mosquitoes.\\" Lily Pond at Lake Palace, Udaipur Bhagwat Singh decided to convert the Jag Niwas Palace into Udaipur's first luxury hotel. Didi Contractor, an American artist, became a design consultant to this hotel project. Didi's accounts gives an insight to the life and responsibility of the new Maharana of Udaipur: > I worked from 1961 to 1969 and what an adventure!

N-RAP is a muscle-specific isoform belonging to the nebulin family of proteins. This family is composed of 5 members: N-RAP, nebulin, nebulette, LASP-1 and LASP-2. N-RAP is involved in both myofibrillar myogenesis during development and cell-cell connections in mature muscle.  Structure  N-RAP is a 197 kDa protein composed of 1730 amino acids. As a member of the nebulin family of proteins, N-RAP is characterized by 35 amino acid stretches of ‚Äò‚Äònebulin repeats‚Äô‚Äô, which are actin binding domains containing a conserved SDxxYK motif. Like nebulin, groups of seven single repeats within N-RAP form ‚Äúsuper repeats‚Äù, which incorporate a single conserved motif WLKGIGW at the end of the third repeat. A unique feature of NRAP relative to nebulin is its N-terminal cysteine-rich LIM domain, a feature shared with LASP-1 and LASP-2.  Function  An important role has been implicated for N-RAP in myofibrilar organization during cardiomyocyte development. It is clear that NRAP is critical for normal Œ±-actinin-dependent organization of myofibrils in cardiomyocytes, as knock-down of N-RAP protein levels causes myofbrillar disassembly in embryonic cardiomyocytes. Specifically, studies suggest that NRAP super repeats may be an essential scaffold for organizing alpha-actinin and actin into sarcomereic I-Z-I complexes in premyofibrils, and dynamic imaging studies have shown that N-RAP departs from the I-Z-I complexes upon completion of actin thin filament assembly. In adult cardiac muscle, N-RAP colocalizes to intercalated discs, where it functions to anchor terminal actin filaments to the sarcolemma. It has been suggested that its role in adult muscle is force transduction from the sarcomere to the extracellular matrix.  Clinical significance  Though no known direct link exists between N-RAP mutations and human cardiomyopathies, N-RAP has been shown to be significantly upregulated in murine models of dilated cardiomyopathy. This has been hypothesized to be an adaptive response to correct for disorganized actin thin filament architecture at intercalated disc junctions in cardiomyocytes during dilated cardiomyopathy.

Selva (born 1948) is Professor Emeritus of Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of Maine at Fort Kent, a world-renowned lichenologist, and curator of UMFK's lichen herbarium. Selva is an expert on stubble lichens of the order Caliciales, called so because their millimeter- high stalks resemble beard stubble. Academic career Selva attended Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, earning bachelor's degrees in biology and botany. He continued his education at Iowa State University in Ames where he earned his PhD in botany. His dissertation focused on establishing biostratigraphic units based on freshwater diatoms preserved in the soil of the Ogallala Aquifer. During the course of his research, Selva discovered seven new species of diatoms. In 1976, Selva began his teaching career at the University of Maine at Fort Kent where he teaches courses in environmental studies, dendrology, general botany, plant taxonomy, plant physiology, and lichenology. In 1983, Selva spent seven months in Ottawa studying the lichens of Aroostook County, Maine (where UMFK is located) with Irwin Murray Brodo.Faculty entry on University of Maine at Fort Kent website Though the University of Maine at Fort Kent does not require research as a condition of employment, Selva actively pursues many ongoing lichen research programs, receiving grants from organizations such as the Appalachian Mountain Club, The Nature Conservancy, the New Brunswick Museum, the National Geographic Society, and the Northeastern Forest Experiment Station. The focus of his lichenological research centers on the use of stubble lichens as environmental indicators, both in reference to the age of a forest and its level of pollution. Selva retired in 2013 and was elected Professor Emeritus by the UMFK faculty following his retirement. He continues to work with the lichen herbarium on the UMFK campus. Lichen herbarium Housed in Cyr Hall of the University of Maine at Fort Kent's campus, Selva's lichen herbarium is one of the largest in the world. It contains around 60,000 specimens of multiple varieties of lichens, including the largest collection of stubble lichens in North America as well as the largest collection of old growth forest lichens in the northeastern United States. Beginning in 2001, Selva and colleague/former student Ray Albert began uploading the contents of the lichen herbarium online at the University of Maine at Fort Kent's Lichen Research Program. The database contains specific information on the collection location, habitat information, and the substrate or base on which the lichens were found. Eventually Selva and Albert hope to include microscope images of each specimen along with the latitude and longitude of where they were collected.UMFK's Lichen Research Program Fellowships, honors, and memberships Selva holds the following fellowships, honors, and memberships: * Florence M. Christie Research Fellowship sponsored by the New Brunswick Museum, Saint John, New Brunswick (1989) * Outstanding Contribution to Faculty Excellence Award, presented by the University of Maine at Fort Kent faculty senate (1990) * Current memberships in the American Bryological and Lichenological Society, the British Lichen Society, the International Association for Lichenology, the Josselyn Botanical Society, and The Nature Conservancy.

It belongs to the superfamily of enzymes known as glutathione S-transferase (GST), which are mainly known for cellular detoxification. The GSTK1 gene consists of eight exons and seven introns and although it is a member of the GST family, its structure has been found to be similar to bacterial HCCA (2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate) isomerases and bacterial disulphide-bond- forming DsbA oxidoreductase. This similarity has later allowed the enzyme GSTK1 to be renamed to DsbA-L. Research has also suggested that several variations of the GSTK1 gene can be responsible for metabolic diseases and certain types of cancer. Structure The GSTK1 enzyme is a homodimer and, like all GSTs, it contains a TRX-like domain and a helical domain. However, the GSTK1 is substantially different in its secondary structure compared to the other GSTs. The helical domain has been observed to be placed between the Œ≤Œ±Œ≤ and Œ≤Œ≤Œ± motifs of the TRX-like domain, rather than the TRX-like domain and the C-terminal helical domain being connected together by a short linker of alpha-helixes as normally seen in GSTs. Also, the GSTK1 dimer employs a butterfly shape and not a V-shaped crevice like in the other classes. As for the GSTK1 gene, it is ~5 kb long, has eight exons, is located on chromosome 7q34, and includes an initiator element at the transcription start site instead of a TATA or a CCAAT box.  Function  GSTK1 promotes adiponectin multimerization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) though the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. GSTK1 can prevent ER stress and ER stress- induced adiponectin down-regulation, implying that GSTK1 assists the ER‚Äôs functions. GSTK1 is located in the ER and also in the mitochondria of hepatocytes. This indicates a potential role for GSTK1 in the interaction between the two organelles; though this is poorly understood. The discovery of GSTK1 in the peroxisome has led to studies based on its function. It has been suggested that, similar to GSTA, GSTK1 may play a role in the buffering of acyl-CoA and xenobiotic-CoA and be involved in their binding activities. GSTK1 may also be responsible for the detoxification of lipid peroxides created in the peroxisome based on the peroxidase activity towards three substrates: tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and 15-S-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid.  Clinical significance  The amount of expression of adiponectin has been observed to be related to diseases such as insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Decreased amounts of the protein indicates that there is a higher probability of receiving said diseases. Because the GSTK1 is seen to play a role in the multimerization of adiponectin, this enzyme can regulate the concentration of adiponectin and thus enhance insulin sensitivity and protect against diabetes. Also, the GSTK1 gene is unregulated when it is inflicted with oxidative stress and are over expressed in many tumors leading to difficulties during cancer chemotherapy. Moreover, GSTK1 gene expression has been seen to increase significantly in correlation to drug resistance in tumor cells such as erythroleukemia and mammary adenocarcinoma suggesting that it, along with GSTP1 and GSTA4, could be responsible for the drug resistance. GSTK1 can also be a potential tool to help investigate cancer. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins are responsible for many of the cell functions such as the cell‚Äôs growth, division, adhesion, and motility. These activities are also very related to cancer and thus studying this protein could allow access to information which could classify tumors for prognosis and prediction. Due to GSTK1‚Äôs C-terminal SH2 domain, tyrosine phosphorylated proteins can bind to it and allow for easier detection to which the protein can be studied.

Mitochondrial ATP synthase catalyzes ATP synthesis, utilizing an electrochemical gradient of protons across the inner membrane during oxidative phosphorylation. ATP synthase is composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the soluble catalytic core, F1, and the membrane-spanning component, Fo, comprising the proton channel. The catalytic portion of mitochondrial ATP synthase consists of 5 different subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon) assembled with a stoichiometry of 3 alpha, 3 beta, and a single representative of the other 3. The proton channel seems to have nine subunits (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, F6 and 8). This gene encodes the b subunit of the proton channel. The b subunits are part of the peripheral stalk that links the F1 and FO complexes together, and which acts as a stator to prevent certain subunits from rotating with the central rotary element. The peripheral stalk differs in subunit composition between mitochondrial, chloroplast and bacterial F-ATPases. In bacterial and chloroplast F-ATPases, the peripheral stalk is composed of one copy of the delta subunit (homologous to OSCP in mitochondria), and two copies of subunit b in bacteria, or one copy each of subunits b and b' in chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria.

An alternative transcript has been described, but its biological nature has not been determined. This gene has a closely linked pseudogene that is distally located. This gene encodes a member of a highly conserved protein family that exists from archaea to vertebrates and plants.  Function  The encoded protein plays an essential role in ribosome biogenesis. SBDS interacts with elongation factor-like GTPase 1 (Efl1) to disassociate eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (eIF6) from the late cytoplasmic pre-60S ribosomal subunit allowing assembly of the 80S. Dynamic rotation of the SBDS protein in the ribosomal P site is coupled to a conformational switch in EFL1 that promotes eIF6 displacement through competition for an overlapping binding site on the 60S ribosomal subunit. Yeast SBDS ortholog, Sdo1, functions within a pathway containing Efl1 to facilitate the release and recycling of the nucleolar shuttling factor Tif6 (yeast eIF6 ortholog) from late cytoplasmic pre-60S ribosomal subunit. Knockdown of SBDS expression results in increased apoptosis in erythroid cells undergoing differentiation due to elevated ROS levels. Hence SBDS is critical for normal erythropoiesis. This family is highly conserved in species ranging from archaea to vertebrates and plants. The family contains several Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS) proteins from both mouse and humans. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder with clinical features that include pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, haematological dysfunction and skeletal abnormalities. Members of this family play a role in RNA metabolism. A number of uncharacterised hydrophilic proteins of about 30 kDa share regions of similarity. These include, * Mouse protein 22A3. * Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XII hypothetical protein YLR022c. * Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein W06E11.4. * Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0592. This particular protein sequence is highly conserved in species ranging from archaea to vertebrates and plants.  Structure  The SBDS protein contains three domains, an N-terminal conserved FYSH domain, central helical domain and C-terminal domain containing an RNA-binding motif. = N-terminal domain = This protein domain appears to be very important, since mutations in this domain are usually the cause of Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome. It shares distant structural and sequence homology to a protein named YHR087W found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein YHR087W is involved in RNA metabolism, so it is probable that the SBDS N-terminal domain has the same function. The N-terminal domains contains a novel mixed alphabeta fold, four beta-strands, and four alpha-helices arranged as a three beta stranded anti- parallel-sheet. = Central domain = The function of this protein domain has been difficult to elucidate. It is possible that it has a role in binding to DNA or RNA. Protein binding to form a protein complex is also another possibility. It has been difficult to infer the function from the structure since this particular domain structure is found in archea. This domain contains a very common structure, the winged helix-turn-helix. = C-terminal domain = In molecular biology, the SBDS C-terminal protein domain is highly conserved in species ranging from archaea to vertebrates and plants. Members of this family are thought to play a role in RNA metabolism. However, its precise function remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, its structure makes it very difficult to predict the protein domain's function. The structure of the C-terminal domain contains a ferredoxin-like fold This structure has a four- stranded beta-sheet with two helices on one side.  Clinical significance  Mutations within this gene are associated with Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome. The two most common mutations associated with this syndrome are at positions 183‚Äì184 (TA‚ÜíCT) resulting in a premature stop-codon (K62X) and a frameshift mutation at position 258 (2T‚ÜíC) resulting in a stopcodon (C84fsX3).

Guesthouse Located to the south side of and part of the City Palace complex, work on this building was begun by Maharana Sajjan Shambhu Singh (1874 to 1884) and finished by his successor Maharana Fateh Singh at the beginning of the 20th century as a royal guesthouse. During its time as a guesthouse it hosted a number of royal gatherings and VIP visits from all over the world, including George V of the United Kingdom in 1905, and Edward the Prince of Wales. By the time that Bhagwat Singh succeeded to the throne of Mewar in 1955, it was becoming increasing difficult for the royal family to afford the cost of maintaining the large numbers of royal residences that they owned, in particular the city palace. Following his success in converting the Lake Palace into an income generating hotel he decided to also convert the Shiv Niwas and the smaller Fateh Prakash Palace into luxury heritage hotels. After a 4 year long period of conversion the Shiv Niwas opened as a hotel in 1982. Hotel The 3 levels of the palace are arranged in a semicircular arc around an internal courtyard in the middle of which is a marble pool. Balconies and rooftop terraces opening off different rooms enjoy views to the south of the gardens laid below the dam wall of Lake Pichola; while to the west, the island resorts of Jag Mandir and the Lake Palace. The building is of ancient Rajput architectural styles.

Function  The Golgi complex plays a key role in the sorting and modification of proteins exported from the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein encoded by this gene is a type II Golgi transmembrane protein. It processes protein synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and assists in the transport of protein cargo through the Golgi apparatus. The expression of this encoded protein has been observed to be upregulated in response to viral infection.  Clinical significance  Golgi membrane protein 1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer and lung adenocarcinoma tissue. Blood levels of GP73 are higher in patients with liver cancer than in healthy individuals. In addition, levels were not significantly higher in patients with diseases other than liver disease. The current blood test used to screen for early tumors in people at high risk for liver cancer involves the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Patients who are at risk for non- metastatic, or primary, liver cancer typically have chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis. Such cases of cirrhosis are usually due to infection caused by infectious hepatitis (usually hepatitis B or hepatitis C, though there are other strains), or because of degenerative fatty liver disease (which can be especially severe in those with alcoholism). However, the AFP test is not usually sensitive enough to detect liver cancer in time and it often generates false positives. So far, the blood samples of more than 1,000 patients with various stages of liver and non-liver disease have been tested for the presence of GP73 in several studies.

Five alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported. The protein associates with the SWI/SNF complex, that regulates gene expression via chromatin remodelling. BCL11A is highly expressed in several hematopoietic lineages, and plays a role in the switch from Œ≥- to Œ≤-globin expression during the fetal to adult erythropoiesis transition. Furthermore, BCL11A is expressed in the brain, where it forms a protein complex with CASK to regulate axon outgrowth and branching. In the neocortex, BCL11A binds to the TBR1 regulatory region and inhibits the expression of TBR1.  Clinical significance  The corresponding Bcl11a mouse gene is a common site of retroviral integration in myeloid leukemia, and may function as a leukemia disease gene, in part, through its interaction with BCL6. During hematopoietic cell differentiation, this gene is down-regulated. It is possibly involved in lymphoma pathogenesis since translocations associated with B-cell malignancies also deregulates its expression. In addition, BCL11A has been found to play a role in the suppression of fetal hemoglobin production. Therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing fetal globin production in diseases such as beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia by inhibiting BCL11A are currently being explored. Furthermore, heterozygous de novo mutations in BCL11A have been identified in an intellectual disability disorder, accompanied with global developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. These mutations disrupt BCL11A homodimerization and transcriptional regulation.  Interactions  BCL11A has been shown to interact with a number of proteins. BCL11A was initially discovered as a COUP-TFI interacting protein. In the nucleus, BCL11A forms paraspeckles that co-localize with NONO. In neurons, BCL11A interacts with CASK to regulate target genes. Furthermore, BCL11A interacts with the neuron-specific protein TBR1, which is also implicated in intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.

The \\"CPVL\\" gene is expressed mainly in monocytes and macrophages, and it is located in the endoplasmatic reticulum and in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. The distribution of CPVL suggests that the enzyme may be involved in antigen processing and the secretory pathway. Besides those macrophages-rich tissues, the heart and kidney also express high levels of CPVL mRNA.The enzyme is similar to the carboxypeptidases CATHA and SCPEP1, but no direct confirmation of the enzymatic activity was obtained so far. The exact function of this protein, however, has not been determined.  Structure  = Gene = \\"CPVL\\" gene is located at chromosome 7p15.1, consisting of 14 exons. At least two alternatively spliced transcripts which encode the same protein have been observed. = Protein = The designation of CPVL is a true serine carboxypeptidase. Although the primary sequence displays the expected serine carboxypeptidase active site, the enzymatic activity remains to be demonstrated. The primary sequence of CPVL contains a putative signal sequence, four potential N-linked glycosylation sites and four myristoylation sites, but no transmembrane domain, suggesting that it may be luminal in an organelle and/or involved in the secretory pathway.  Function  Although the primary sequence of CPVL bears every hallmarks of a serine carboxypeptidase, the enzymatic function of CPVL has not been confirmed. On the basis of its localization, CPVL is postulated to play a role in the biosynthesis of secretory molecules or in the processing and transport of peptides for loading onto MHC ‚Ö† molecules, or in MHC ‚Ö°-dependent APC functions. The high-level expression of CPVL mRNA in heart and kidney implies that CPVL may also have extraimmune functions, such as regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis.  Clinical significance  The deletion of this gene has been reported associated with Wilms tumor. GWAS show that genetic variations of the CPVL gene are associated with susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in European Americans, Japanese and Chinese.

PINX1 is also known as PIN2 interacting protein 1. PINX1 is a telomerase inhibitor and a possible tumor suppressor. Interactions PINX1 has been shown to interact with MCRS1, TERF1 and telomerase reverse transcriptase.  Structure  There are two known variants of PINX1. The second variant ‚Äúlacks an exon in the 3‚Äô coding region which results in a frameshift compared to variant 1. The encoded isoform is shorter and has a distinct C-terminus compared to isoform 1.‚Äù There are three PINX1 cDNA clones. The longest one encodes a 328 amino acid 45kDa protein which contains an N-terminal Gly-rich patch and a C-terminal TID domain (telomerase inhibitory domain). The TRF1 binding domain is in the C-terminal 75 amino acids of PINX1. Mouse PINX1 is 74% identical to human PINX1. In other eukaryotes, including yeast, there is an overall 50% similarity to human PINX1.  Function  Over-expression of PINX1 results in decreased telomerase activity, telomere shortening, and induction of crisis. Reduction of PINX1 leads to an increase in telomerase activity and elongation of telomeres. PINX1 differs from other proteins that regulate telomere length in that it acts on telomerase while other proteins adjust telomere length without affecting telomerase activity. The PINX1 budding yeast orthologue Gnop1 inhibits telomerase by isolating the uncomplexed TERT protein so that it cannot associate with the telomerase template RNA, which prevents telomerase from being assembled. However, in humans, PINX1 impedes already assembled telomerase. PINX1 binds to N-terminus of hTERT and binds to hTR in the presence of hTERT. PINX1 binding to hTR ‚Äúis correlated to the repressive function of PINX1 on telomerase, implying that the mode of enzyme telomerase inhibition by PINX1 may involve an associated with hTR....The effect of hPINX1 on telomerase appears to be exclusive of the G-patch region and is mediated instead by the C terminus of the protein. This suggests that hPINX1 may have functionally separable cellular effects in which the N terminus is involved in RNA processing via the G-patch, and the C terminus is involved in telomere dynamics.‚Äù It is suggested that ‚ÄúPINX1 represses telomerase activity in vivo by binding to the assembled hTERT-hTR complex.‚Äù The TID domain of PINX1 is likely what binds to hTERT. In cells, full-length PINX1 is not as strong as just the TID domain at inhibiting telomerase. This may be due to full-length PINX1 being subject to ‚Äúendogenous regulation such as posttranslational modifications to reduce its inhibitory activity.‚Äù Or it may be due to a reduction of the TID domain to bind and inhibit telomerase as a result of proteins interacting with PINX1, such as PIN2/TRF1 which colocalizes PINX1 in cells. There are two types of PINX1: nuclear PINX1 which is associates with telomeres and CAC repeats and nucleolar PINX1 does not bind directly to the telomeres, but instead interacts with TRF1. Nucleolar hPINX1 mediates the movement of hTERT and TRF1 to the nucleolus. Over-expression of nucleolar hPINX1 leads to increased TRF1 in the nucleolus and binding to telomeres. However, this accumulation in the nucleolus was not found in ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres) cells indicating that PINX1 function is telomerase dependent. hPINX1 is found more in the nucleoplasm during the S phase which is also when telomerase is released into the nucleoplasm indicating that hPINX1 may inhibit telomerase during the S phase.  Cancer  PINX1 is located at 8p23. Heterozygosity of this area is frequently lost in tumors including liver, prostate, prostate, colorectal, lung, and head and neck. Most PINX1 mutant tumors are carcinomas. PINX1 expression is significantly reduced in these tumors. This significance was shown with HT1080 cells, which increased tumorigenicity with decreased PINX1 expression. Over-expression of PINX1 in HT1080 cells did not allow them to form tumors in mice. Therefore, PINX1 may be a tumor suppressor. PINX1 expression is a predictor of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) cells response to cisplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy. High levels of PINX1 correlated to response. But the levels of PINX1 were only associated with cytotoxicity of paclitaxel. Reduced levels of PINX1 led to increased paclitaxel cytotoxicity. ‚ÄúThe ability of PINX1 to stabilize the tension between sister kinetochores and maintain the spindle assembly checkpoint was the main reason CSCC cells undergo apoptosis when treated with paclitaxel.‚Äù Chemoradiotherapy is a standard treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Reduced PINX1 expression did not affect ESCC cells response to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, but did increase efficacy of radiation therapy. High levels of PINX1 led to reduced cell death due to radiation. ‚ÄúPINX1 resistance to radiotherapy (RT) was attributed to PINX1 maintaining telomere stability, reducing ESCC cell death by RT-induced mitosis catastrophe.‚Äù High levels of PINX1 is a predictor of short disease-specific survival. PINX1 levels were found to be reduced in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) compared to normal urothelial bladder epithelium. ‚ÄúPINX1 levels were inversely correlated with tumor multiplicity, advanced N classification, high proliferation index, and poor survival.‚Äù Over-expression of PINX1 reduced UCB cell proliferation and G1/S phase arrest.

The Cecil's address is at Chaura Maidan. At an elevation of seven thousand feet, it sits at the foothills of the Himalayas. with a stunning view of the mountains and valleys. History The hotel was established in 1884 by the British but was later purchased by one of its employees, Mohan Singh Oberoi, who later founded the Oberoi Hotels group, which presently owns and operates the property Mohan Singh Oberoi, 103, A Pioneer in Luxury Hotels New York Times, May 4, 2002.The centennial Man Times of India, 1 September 2001. The Cecil had quite modest beginnings in 1883 as a one-storied house, the Tendril Cottage with its famed inhabitant, Rudyard Kipling. It is claimed that Kipling frequented the house where he wrote his novels, including Plain Tales from the Hills, which was inspired by Shimla. According to an account, Kipling would book himself into the cottage every summer for five consecutive years, making his journey from Lahore to the British retreat. The author first set foot on The Cecil in the summer of 1883 when he was just 17.  Oberoi acquisition  Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi came to Shimla while he was a jobless newlywed to find work in the government. However, he was employed at The Cecil in 1922, starting as a staff in the boiler room, tasked with weighing coal sacks for the hotel's water heaters. He rose from the ranks until finally, he was able to acquire The Cecil as a part of the acquisition of the Associated Hotels of India in 1944. Oberoi's experiences, since he took every job possible at the hotel, helped him learn the hospitality trade and understand what motivates various classes of hotel guests. Under his ownership, The Cecil became the address that everyone wanted to be seen at and it was able to establish its own legacy of luxury. For instance, the famous Balls and Floor shows and Lola, the dancer added to the reputation of the hotel. The hotel was closed in 1984 for extensive renovation and refurbishment and was reopened in 1997. The renovation included a heated swimming pool, billiards rooms, and a children activity center along with the customary amenities such as fine-dining restaurants and luxurious room.

NALP proteins, such as NALP2, are characterized by an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and are involved in the activation of caspase-1 (CASP1; MIM 147678) by Toll-like receptors(see TLR4). They may also be involved in protein complexes that activate proinflammatory caspases (Tschopp et al., 2003).[supplied by OMIM]  Function  The NLRP2 gene is one of the family members of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR). Information from many literature sources indicates that an N-terminal pyrin effector domain (PYD) is one of the components of the NLRP2 gene. Other components include a centrally-located nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR). The products of NLRP2 gene are known to interact with IkB kinase (IKK) complex components. It can also regulate the activities of both caspase-1 and nuclear factor kappa- light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB). The pyrin domain is essential and adequate to suppress the activities of NF-kB (Minkiewicz, de Rivero Vaccari and Keane 1113). An allelic variant (rs147585490) is known to block the NF-kB transcriptional activities. NLRP2 gene is one of the NLR family; it is believed to contribute to the regulation of immune responses (Minkiewicz, de Rivero Vaccari and Keane 1121). Although it is not well understood, the NLRP2 gene is responsible for maintaining fertility in females and contributes to the normal birth. The NPRP2 gene encodes for a human protein known as ‚ÄúNACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 2‚Äù. NALP2, which is one of the NALP proteins, has an N-terminal pyrin characterization also encoded as MIM 608107 and PYD domain. The NALP2 protein has a role in the activation process of caspase-1, which is encoded as CASP1; MIM 147678. The activation process occurs through the Toll-like receptors. The NALP2 may also take part in protein complexes, which initiates the activation of proinflammatory caspases. NLR family regulates the functioning of the immune system, which technically compromises the normal functions of the body including reproduction.  Discovery  The NLR gene family where the NLRP2 gene belongs was first extracted from zebrafish, which is a common specimen for the study of immune systems. The NLRP2 gene is believed to have originated from the NLR gene family through mutation. The mutation was initiated by the need for organisms to fit a dynamic environment and diversification in the evolution stages. Also, the mutation of the NLR gene family proteins was also due to the ability of pathogens to subvert the defense mechanism of the host. Therefore, the organisms were forced to device new ways of detecting and counteracting the effects of the resistant pathogens. The evolution of the NLR proteins defines the origin of the NLRP2 gene. The NLRP2 gene is now an innate immune sensor for pathogens and sterile stress signal (SSS) in multi-cellular organisms.  Mutation and infertility  The deficiency of NLRP2 gene results in the inhibition of the activation of oocytes. The NLRP2 gene is exclusively expressed in oocytes. Therefore, it regulates the quality of the oocytes, which explains its relation to infertility in females.

His venture Udaya Studios influenced the gradual shift of Malayalam film industry from its original base of Madras, Tamil Nadu to Kerala. He is the producer of Jeevithanauka (1951), starring Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair. Early life Kunchacko was born to Mani Chacko Maliampurackal and Eliyamma in Pulinkunnoo, Alappuzha, Kerala, India in 1912. His father was the first to start a boat service in Kuttanad. Kunchacko became interested in the art of filmmaking as he grew up. After finishing his intermediate schooling (pre-degree equivalent) he made plans to establish a film studio in Kerala. Career In 1947, he established Udaya Studio in Pathirappally, Alappuzha. In his early days, Kunchacko produced films under the banner of K & K Productions, with the partnership of K. V. Koshy. The company produced 4 films: Vellinakshatram, Nalla Thanka, Jeevithanauka and Visappinte Vili. Jeevithanauka (1951), starring Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair ran for 250 days. During the making of the film Achchan, Kunchacko and Koshy parted ways and each started film-making under separate banners: Kunchacko under Udaya and Koshi under Filmco.weblokam.com - Profile Kunchacko went on to produce Achchan, Avan Varunnu and Kidappadam under the banner of Udaya. Kidappadam was a commercial failure, and that caused Kunchacko to close down Udaya Studio. However, Udaya was opened within a few years with the help of his friend and Kerala state minister T. V. Thomas. In 1960, Kunchacko tried his hand in film direction with Umma, which he followed with Neeli Saali and Seetha. He went on to direct 40 films in his career of many genres including purana stories, vadakkan pattu stories, comedy films and social themed films. Some of his films are Bharya, Unniyarcha, Palattukoman, Sakunthala, Pazhassiraja, Mainatheruvi Kolacase, Ponnapuram Kotta, Anarkali and Kannappanunni. His career in film direction went along with his career as film producer. He produced films directed by various directors such as M. Krishnan Nair (Agni Mrigam, Thara, Kattuthulasi), A. Vincent (Gandharva Kshethram), Thoppil Bhasi (Oru Sundariyude Katha, Ningalenne Communistakki), K.S. Sethumadhavan (Koottukudumbam) and K. Raghunath (Laura Neeyevide).In 1976, Kunchacko died in Madras, Tamil Nadu with musician K. Raghavan for the song recording of the film Mallanum Mathevanum. Kannappanunni was the last film directed by him. His death occurred on the fifth death anniversary (15 June) of the veteran Malayalam actor Sathyan, who acted in many of his films. Kunchako's Udaya Studios faced heavy losses later, and stopped production. Family Kunchacko's son Boban Kunchacko acted in a few films produced by Udaya as a child artist. He later ventured into direction with the films Palattu Kunhikkannan, Sanchari, and Aazhi. His grandson, Kunchacko Boban is also a Malayalam film actor.Boben Kunchacko dead The Hindu, 10 July 2004.

PTPRK is also known as PTPkappa and PTPŒ∫.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. Protein tyrosine phosphatases are protein enzymes that remove phosphate moieties from tyrosine residues on other proteins. Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that add phosphates to tyrosine residues, and are the opposing enzymes to PTPs. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. The human PTPRK gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6, a putative tumor suppressor region of the genome. = During development = The same reporter construct used by Shen and colleagues, and described above was created by Skarnes et al. during a screen to identify genes important in mouse development. The transgenic mouse was created by combining a Œ≤-galactosidase (Œ≤-gal) reporter gene with a signal sequence and the transmembrane domain of the type I transmembrane protein CD4. If the transgene was incorporated into a gene with a signal sequence, Œ≤-gal activity would remain in the cytosol of the cell and therefore be active. If the reporter gene was incorporated into a gene that lacked a signal sequence, Œ≤-gal activity would be in the ER where it would lose Œ≤-gal activity. This construct inserted into the phosphatase domain of PTPkappa. Mice generated from these ES cells were viable, suggesting that PTPkappa phosphatase activity is not necessary for embryonic development. Additional studies have suggested a function for PTPkappa during nervous system development. PTPkappa promotes neurite outgrowth from embryonic cerebellar neurons, and thus may be involved in axonal extension or guidance in vivo. Neurites are extensions from neurons that can be considered the in vitro equivalent of axons and dendrites. The extension of cerebellar neurites on purified PTPkappa fusion proteins was demonstrated to require Grb2 and MEK1 activity. = In T cells = PTPkappa has also been shown to regulate CD4+ positive T cell development. PTPkappa and the THEMIS gene are both deleted in the rat Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) strain, and are both required for the CD4+ T-cell deficiency observed in this strain of rats. Deletion of PTPkappa was shown to generate T-helper immunodeficiency in the LEC strain. By expressing a dominant negative form of PTPkappa or by using short-hairpin RNA for PTPkappa in bone-marrow derived stem cells, Erdenbayer and colleagues demonstrated that CD4(+) T cells development was inhibited. PTPkappa likely regulates T-cell development by positively regulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation via the regulation of MEK1/2 and c-Raf phosphorylation. = Cadherin-catenin signaling = PTPkappa is localized to cell-cell contact sites, where it colocalizes and co- immunoprecipitates with Œ≤-catenin and plakoglobin/Œ≥-catenin Œ≤-catenin may be a PTPkappa substrate. The presence of full-length PTPkappa in melanoma cells decreases the level of free-cytosolic Œ≤-catenin, which consequently reduces the level of nuclear Œ≤-catenin and reduces the expression of the Œ≤-catenin- regulated genes, cyclin D1 and c-myc. Expression of ful-length PTPkappa in melanoma cells that normally lack its expression results in reduced cell migration and cell proliferation. Because the presence of PTPkappa at the cell membrane was shown to sequester Œ≤-catenin to the plasma membrane, these data suggest that one mechanism whereby PTPkappa functions as a tumor suppressor is by regulating the intracellular localization of free-Œ≤-catenin. The intracellular fragments of PTPkappa, PŒîE and PIC, are catalytically active, and can also dephosphorylate Œ≤-catenin. Tyrosine phosphorylated Œ≤-catenin translocates to the cell nucleus and activates TCF-mediated transcription to promote cell proliferation and migration. While full-length PTPkappa antagonizes TCF-mediated transcription, the PIC fragment augments it, perhaps by regulating other proteins in TCF-mediated transcription. This suggests that phosphatase activity of the PIC fragment opposes that of full-length PTPkappa. PTPkappa interacts by co-immunoprecipitation with E-cadherin, Œ±-catenin and Œ≤-catenin in pancreatic acinar cells prior to the dissolution of adherens junctions in a rat model of pancreatitis. The authors suggest that the presence of PTPkappa at the plasma membrane in association with the cadherin/catenin complex is important for the maintenance of adherens junction in pancreatic acinar cells, much as it was suggested above in melanoma cells. = EGFR signaling = Use of short interfering RNA (siRNA) of PTPkappa to reduce PTPkappa protein expression in the mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A, resulted in increased cell proliferation. PTPkappa expression, conversely, was demonstrated to reduce cell proliferation in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The mechanism proposed to explain the influence of PTPkappa on cell proliferation is via PTPkappa dephosphorylation of the EGFR on tyrosines 1068 and 1173 directly. The reduction of PTPkappa expression in CHO cells with PTPkappa siRNA increased EGFR phosphorylation. Therefore, the hypothesis is that PTPkappa functions as a tumor suppressor gene by dephosphorylating and inactivating EGFR. In addition, glycosylation by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V (GnT-V) has been shown to reduce full-length PTPkappa expression, likely via increasing its cleavage. This aberrant glycosylation has been shown to increase the phosphorylation of EGFR on tyrosine 1068, likely because of reduced plasma-membrane associated PTPkappa expression and hence reduced PTPkappa-mediated dephosphorylation of its membrane associated substrates, such as EGFR.  Structure  PTPkappa possesses an extracellular region, a single transmembrane region, and two tandem catalytic domains, and thus represents a receptor-type PTP (RPTP). The extracellular region contains a meprin-A5 antigen-PTP mu (MAM) domain, an Ig- like domain and four fibronectin type III-like repeats. PTPkappa is a member of the R2B subfamily of RPTPs, which includes RPTPM, RPTPT, and RPTPU. PTPkappa shares most sequence similarity with PTPmu and PTPrho. Crystal structure analysis of the first phosphatase domain of PTPkappa demonstrates that it shares many conformational features with PTPmu, including an unhindered open conformation for the catalytically important WPD loop, and a phosphate binding loop for the active-site cysteine (Cys1083). PTPkappa exists as a monomer in solution, with the caveat that dimers of PTPkappa are observed depending on the nature of the buffer used.  Alternative splicing  Alternative splicing of exons 16, 17a, and 20a has been described for PTPRK. Two novel forms of PTPRK were identified from mouse full-length cDNA sequences and were predicted to result in two PTPkappa splice variants: a secreted form of PTPkappa and a membrane tethered form.  Homophilic binding  PTPkappa mediates homophilic cell-cell aggregation via its extracellular domain. PTPkappa only mediates binding between cells expressing PTPkappa (i.e. homophilic), and will not mediate cell aggregation between cells expressing PTPkappa, PTPmu or PTPrho (i.e. heterophilic).  Regulation  = Proteolysis and N-glycosylation = Full-length PTPkappa protein is cleaved by furin to generate two cleaved fragments that remain associated at the plasma membrane, an extracellular (E) subunit and an intracellular phosphatase (P) subunit. In response to high cell density or calcium influx following trifluoperazine (TFP) stimulation, PTPkappa is further cleaved by ADAM 10 to yield a shed extracellular fragment and a membrane tethered intracellular fragment, PŒîE. The membrane tethered PŒîE fragment is further cleaved by the gamma secretase complex to yield a membrane-released fragment, PIC, that can translocate to the cellular nucleus, where it is catalytically active. Glycosylation of the extracellular domain of PTPkappa was demonstrated to occur preferentially in WiDr colon cancer cells that over-express N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase V (GnT-V). Over-expression of GnT-V in these cells increased the cleavage and shedding of PTPkappa ectodomain and increased migration of WiDr cells in transwell assays. As a result of glycosylation of PTPkappa by GnT-V, EGFR was phosphorylated on tyrosine 1068 and activated, and is likely the cause of the increased cell migration observed following PTPkappa cleavage. Shedding of PTPkappa may also be regulated by the presence of galectin-3 binding protein, as has been shown in WiDr cells. The authors suggest that the ratio of galectin-3 binding protein to galectin 3 influences the cleavage and shedding of PTPkappa, although the exact mechanism of how these proteins regulate PTPkappa cleavage was not determined. = By reactive oxygen species in cancer = One mechanism whereby PTPkappa tyrosine phosphatase activity can be perturbed in cancer is via oxidative inhibition mediated by reactive oxygen species generated by either hydrogen peroxide in vitro or UV irradiation of skin cells in vivo. In cell-free assays, the presence of hydrogen peroxide reduces PTPkappa tyrosine phosphatase activity and increases EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. UV-irradiation of primary human keratinocytes yields the same results, namely a reduction of PTPkappa tyrosine phosphatase activity and an increase in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. EGFR phosphorylation then leads to cell proliferation, suggesting that PTPkappa may function as a tumor suppressor in skin cancer in addition to melanoma. = Expression = PTPkappa is expressed in human keratinocytes. TGFŒ≤1 is a growth inhibitor in human keratinocytes. Stimulation of the cultured human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, with TGFŒ≤1 increases the levels of PTPkappa (PTPRK) mRNA as assayed by northern blot analysis. TGFŒ≤1 also increased PTPkappa mRNA and protein in normal and tumor mammary cell lines. HER2 overexpression reduced PTPkappa mRNA and protein expression.  Clinical significance  = Melanoma and skin cancer = Expression analysis of PTPkappa mRNA in normal melanocytes and in melanoma cells and tissues demonstrated that PTPkappa is downregulated or absent 20% of the time in melanoma, suggesting that PTPkappa is a tumor suppressor gene in melanoma. A form of PTPkappa with a point mutation in the fourth fibronectin III repeat was identified to be a melanoma specific antigen recognized by CD4+ T cells in a melanoma patient with 10-year tumor-free survival after lymph node resection. This particular mutated form of PTPkappa was not identified in 10 other melanoma cell lines, and may thus represent a unique mutation in one patient. = Lymphoma = PTPkappa was also identified as the putative tumor suppressor gene commonly deleted in primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs). Downregulation of PTPkappa was found to occur following Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection of Hodgkin‚Äôs Lymphomas cells. = Colorectal cancer = Using a transposon-based genetic screen, researchers found that disruption of the PTPRK gene in gastrointestinal tract epithelium resulted in an intestinal lesion, classified as either an intraepithelial neoplasia, an adenocarcinoma or an adenoma. = Lung cancer = PTPRK mRNA was shown to be significantly reduced by RT-PCR in human lung cancer-derived cell lines. = Prostate cancer = PTPRK has also been shown to be downregulated in response to androgen stimulation in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The mechanism whereby PTPRK is downregulated is via the expression of a microRNA, miR-133b, which is upregulated in response to androgen stimulation. = Breast cancer = Patients with reduced PTPRK transcript expression have shorter breast cancer survival times and are more likely to have breast cancer metastases or to die from breast cancer. In an experimental model of breast cancer, PTPRK was reduced in breast cancer cell lines with PTPRK ribozymes. In these cells, adhesion to matrigel, transwell migration, and cell growth were all increased following the reduction of PTPRK expression, again supporting a function for PTPRK as a tumor suppressor. = Glioma = Assem and colleagues identified loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events in malignant glioma specimens, and identified PTPRK as a significant gene candidate in one LOH region. A significant correlation between the presence of PTPRK mutations and short patient survival time was observed. PTPRK was amplified from tumor cDNA to confirm the LOH observed. In these specimens, 6 different mutations were observed, two of which (one in each phosphatase domain) disrupted the enzymatic activity of PTPRK. Expression of wild-type PTPkappa in U87-MG and U251-MG cells resulted in a reduction in cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Expression of the variants of PTPkappa with mutations in the phosphatase domains, however, increased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, supporting a role for the involvement of the mutated variants of PTPkappa in tumorigenicity. = In development = In situ hybridization localized PTPkappa mRNA to the brain, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, placenta, liver, kidney and intestines during development. PTPkappa was also found to be expressed in the developing retina, in nestin-positive radial progenitor cells and later in development, in the ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer and outer segments of photoreceptors. PTPkappa protein is observed in neural progenitor cells and radial glial cells of the developing mouse superior colliculus, as well. In the adult rat brain, PTPkappa mRNA is highly expressed in regions of the brain with cellular plasticity and growth, such as the olfactory bulb, the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. PTPkappa mRNA is also observed in the adult mouse cerebellum. Using a Œ≤-galactosidase (Œ≤-gal) reporter gene inserted into the phosphatase domain of the murine PTPkappa (PTPRK) gene, Shen and colleagues determined the detailed expression pattern of endogenous PTPRK. Œ≤-gal activity was observed in many areas of the adult forebrain, including layers II and IV, and to a lesser extent in layer VI of the cortex. Œ≤-gal activity was also observed in apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells, the granule layer of the olfactory and accessory olfactory bulbs, the anterior hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, and in granule and pyramidal layers of the dentate gyrus and CA 1-3 regions of the hippocampus. In the midbrain, Œ≤-gal was observed in the subthalamic nucleus, the superior and inferior colliculi and in the red nucleus. Œ≤-gal activity was also observed in the neural retina, in the inner nuclear layer and in small ganglion cells of the ganglion cell layer.

PTPRN and PTPRN2 (this gene) are both found to be major autoantigens associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  Function  Due to a close similarity in the gene sequences, the protein encoded by this gene has traditionally been considered a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. However, recent research has shown that the PTPRN2 mouse homolog, known as phogrin, dephosphorylates the lipid phosphatidylinositol rather than tyrosine. Specifically, phogrin was shown to act upon phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, whereas it has never been observed acting upon tyrosine. PTPRN2 should, therefore, be more accurately considered a PIPase rather than a PTPase. Phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol (PI) are called phosphoinositides and play important roles in lipid signaling, cell signaling and membrane trafficking.

RBP3 orthologs have been identified in most eutherians except tenrecs and armadillos.  Function  The inter-photoreceptor retinoid-binding protein is a large glycoprotein known to bind retinoids and found primarily in the interphotoreceptor matrix of the retina between the retinal pigment epithelium and the photoreceptor cells. It is thought to transport retinoids between the retinal pigment epithelium and the photoreceptors, a critical role in the visual process.  Gene  The human IRBP gene is approximately 9.5 kbp in length and consists of four exons separated by three introns. The introns are 1.6-1.9 kbp long. The gene is transcribed by photoreceptor and retinoblastoma cells into an approximately 4.3-kilobase mRNA that is translated and processed into a glycosylated protein of 135,000 Da.  Structure  The amino acid sequence of human IRBP can be divided into four contiguous homology domains with 33-38% identity, suggesting a series of gene duplication events. In the gene, the boundaries of these domains are not defined by exon-intron junctions, as might have been expected. The first three homology domains and part of the fourth are all encoded by the first large exon, which is 3,180 base pairs long. The remainder of the fourth domain is encoded in the last three exons, which are 191, 143, and approximately 740 base pairs long, respectively.  Application  The rbp3 gene is commonly used in animals as a nuclear DNA phylogenetic marker. The exon 1 has first been used in a pioneer study to provide evidence for monophyly of Chiroptera. Then, it has been used to infer the phylogeny of placental mammal orders, and of the major clades of Rodentia, Macroscelidea, and Primates. RBP3 is also useful at lower taxonomic levels, e.g., in muroid rodents and Malagasy primates, at the phylogeography level in Geomys and Apodemus rodents, and even for carnivora species identification purposes.

P. bichir lapradei are demersal, primitive, and popular with experienced aquarists.  Morphology  P. bichir lapradei is visually similar to its close relative, Polypterus bichir. Its body is elongated and subcylindrical, and covered in ganoid scales. As its name suggests (Poly = \\"many\\" and -terus = \\"finned\\"), P. bichir lapradei's most striking asset is the row of dorsal finlets along its back. These finlets, which can number up to 15 in some specimens, constitute a single dorsal fin. This fin is divided by rigid spines, which can be raised or lowered at will (often in response to a threat, or for stability). This is a \\"lower jaw\\" bichir, meaning that its lower jaw is somewhat longer than its upper jaw (i.e. an underbite). Other \\"lower jaw\\" bichir species include P. endlicheri and P. ansorgii. A commonly encountered \\"upper jaw\\" species is P. senegalus. They have prominent external nostrils, which they use to great effect in compensating for their relatively weak eyesight. P. bichir lapradei's coloration and patterning varies quite a bit region-to-region, but certain characteristics are almost always present. These include: * Dark, longitudinal bands, punctuated by irregular, vertical stripes. * Grayish green lateral and dorsal scales. * Grey to white ventral coloration. These bichirs use a coordinated network of fins for locomotion. Their pectoral fins are used for general navigation---they help the fish turn, \\"brake\\", and \\"walk\\" across the bottom of their environment. When held rigid, the pectoral fins are strong enough to allow for short-distance travel across dry land. The ventral fins act as a keel would on a ship, keeping the bichir's subcylindrical body level. The caudal fin, which connects directly to the dorsal fin, is the fish's primary means of propulsion. Although not a particularly fast species, P. bichir lapradei is capable of achieving quick bursts in pursuit of its prey (usually by folding all of its fins tightly against its body, and vigorously thrusting its caudal fin). Bichirs are sexually dimorphic; the males are characterized by a fleshy, wide anal fin, while the females' anal fin is thin and \\"sharp.\\" One of the most interesting characteristics of this (and every) bichir is the presence of a modified swim bladder, which has evolved into a primitive lung structure. The \\"lung\\" is divided into two sections, and enables the bichirs to supplement their oxygen intake by taking gulps at the surface of the water. This function has enabled them to survive in a great variety of water conditions. It also enables them to survive out of water, albeit for relatively brief periods of time. P. bichir lapradei is a fairly large bichir species, reaching around 30\\" total length in adulthood.  Distribution  As with all of the bichir species, P. bichir lapradei is endemic to Africa, where it can be found inhabiting numerous river systems throughout the continent.

It is a critical mediator of synaptic inhibition, cellular protection against excitotoxicity and may also act as a modulator of neuroplasticity. Potassium-chloride transporter member 5 is also known by the names: KCC2 (potassium chloride cotransporter 2) for its ionic substrates, and SLC12A5 for its genetic origin from the SLC12A5 gene in humans. Animals with reduced expression of this transporter exhibit severe motor deficits, epileptiform activity, and spasticity. KCC2 knockout animals, in which KCC2 is completely absent, die postnatally due to respiratory failure. Location KCC2 is a neuron-specific membrane protein expressed throughout the central nervous system, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, brainstem, and motoneurons of the ventral spinal cord. At the subcellular level, KCC2 has been found in membranes of the somata and dendrites of neurons, with no evidence of expression on axons. KCC2 has also been shown to colocalize with GABAA receptors, which serve as ligand-gated ion channels to allow chloride ion movement across the cell membrane. Under normal conditions, the opening of GABAA receptors permits the hyperpolarizing influx of chloride ions to inhibit postsynaptic neurons from firing. Counterintuitively, KCC2 has also been shown to colocalize at excitatory synapses. One suggested explanation for such colocalization is a potential protective role of KCC2 against excitotoxicity. Ion influx due to the excitatory synaptic stimulation of ion channels in the neuronal membrane causes osmotic swelling of cells as water is drawn in alongside the ions. KCC2 may help to eliminate excess ions from the cell in order to re-establish osmotic homeostasis. Structure KCC2 is a member of the cation-chloride cotransporter (CCC) superfamily of proteins. As with all CCC proteins, KCC2 is an integral membrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains and both N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The terminal cytoplasmic domains can be phosphorylated by kinases within the neuron for rapid regulation. =Two Isoforms: KCC2a, KCC2b= There are two isoforms of KCC2: KCC2a and KCC2b. The two isoforms arise from alternative promoters on the SLC12A5 gene and differential splicing of the first mRNA exon. The isoforms differ in their N-termini, with the KCC2a form constituting the larger of the two splice variants. KCC2a levels remain relatively constant during pre- and postnatal development. KCC2b, on the other hand, is scarcely present during prenatal development and is strongly upregulated during postnatal development. The upregulation of KCC2b expression is thought to be responsible for the ‚Äúdevelopmental shift‚Äù observed in mammals from depolarizing postsynaptic effects of inhibitory synapses in early neural networks to hyperpolarizing effects in mature neural networks. KCC2b knockout mice can survive up to postnatal day 17 (P17) due to the presence of functional KCC2a alone, but they exhibit low body weight, motor deficits and generalized seizures. Complete KCC2 knockouts (both KCC2a and KCC2b absent) die after birth due to respiratory failure. =Oligomerization= Both KCC2 isoforms can form homomultimers, or heteromultimers with other K-Cl symporters on the cell membrane to maintain chloride homeostasis in neurons. Dimers, trimers, and tetramers involving KCC2 have been identified in brainstem neurons. Oligomerization may play an important role in transporter function and activation, as it has been observed that the oligomer to monomer ratio increases in correlation to the development of the chloride ion gradient in neurons. Developmental changes in expression KCC2 levels are low during mammalian embryonic development, when neural networks are still being established and neurons are highly plastic (changeable). During this stage, intracellular chloride ion concentrations are high due to low KCC2 expression and high levels of a transporter known as NKCC1 (Na+/K+ chloride cotransporter 1), which moves chloride ions into cells. Thus, during embryonic development, the chloride gradient is such that stimulation of GABAA receptors and glycine receptors at inhibitory synapses causes chloride ions to flow out of cells, making the internal neuronal environment less negative (i.e. more depolarized) than it would be at rest. At this stage, GABAA receptors and glycine receptors act as excitatory rather than inhibitory effectors on postsynaptic neurons, resulting in depolarization and hyperexcitability of neural networks. During postnatal development, KCC2 levels are strongly upregulated while NKCC1 levels are down regulated. This change in expression correlates to a developmental shift of the chloride ion concentration within neurons from high to low intracellular concentration. Effectively, as the chloride ion concentration is reduced, the chloride gradient across the cellular membrane is reversed such that GABAA receptor and glycine receptor stimulation causes chloride ion influx, making the internal neuronal environment more negative (i.e. more hyperpolarized) than it would be at rest. This is the developmental shift of inhibitory synapses from the excitatory postsynaptic responses of the early neural development phase to the inhibitory postsynaptic responses observed throughout maturity.  Function  Current literature suggests that KCC2 serves three primary roles within neurons: # Establishing the chloride ion gradient necessary for postsynaptic inhibition # Protecting neuronal networks against stimulation-induced excitotoxicity # Contributing to dendritic spine morphogenesis and glutamatergic synaptic function = Postsynaptic inhibition = KCC2 is a potassium (K+)/chloride (Cl‚àí) symporter that maintains chloride homeostasis in neurons. The electrochemical chloride gradient established by KCC2 activity is crucial for classical postsynaptic inhibition through GABAA receptors and glycine receptors in the central nervous system. KCC2 utilizes the potassium gradient generated by the Na+/K+ pump to drive chloride extrusion from neurons. In fact, any disruption of the neuronal K+ gradient would indirectly affect KCC2 activity. Loss of KCC2 following neuronal damage (i.e. ischemia, spinal cord damage, physical trauma to the central nervous system) results in the loss of inhibitory regulation and the subsequent development of neuronal hyperexcitability, motor spasticity, and seizure-like activity as GABAA receptors and glycine receptors revert from hyperpolarizing to depolarizing postsynaptic effects. = Cellular protection = High levels of stimulation and subsequent ionic influx through activated ion channels can result in cellular swelling as osmotically-obliged water is drawn into neurons along with ionic solutes. This phenomenon is known as excitotoxicity. KCC2 has been shown to be activated by cell-swelling, and may therefore play a role in eliminating excess ions following periods of high stimulation in order to maintain steady-state neuronal volume and prevent cells from bursting. This role may also account for the fact that KCC2 has been known to colocalize near excitatory synapses, even though its primary role is to establish the chloride gradient for postsynaptic inhibition. = Morphogenesis and function of glutamatergic synapses = In addition to controlling the efficacy of GABAergic synapses through chloride homeostasis, KCC2 play a critical role in the morphogenesis and function of glutamatergic synapses within the central nervous system. Studies on hippocampal tissue in KCC2 knockout animals showed that neurons lacking KCC2 have stunted dendritic growth and malformed dendritic spines. Recent studies demonstrate that KCC2 plays a critical role in the structure and function of dendritic spines which host most excitatory synapses in cortical neurons. Through an interaction with actin cytoskeleton, KCC2 forms a molecular barrier to the diffusion of transmembrane proteins within dendritic spines, thereby regulating the local confinement of AMPA receptors and synaptic potency. It has been proposed that the downregulation of KCC2 observed following neuronal trauma, and the consequent depolarizing shift of GABAA-mediated synapses, may be an aspect of neuronal de- differentiation. De-differentiation of damaged portions of the nervous system would allow for neuronal networks to return to higher levels of plasticity in order to rewire surviving neurons to compensate for damage in the network. In addition, reduced glutamatergic transmission upon KCC2 downregulation may serve as a homeostatic process to compensate for the reduced GABA transmission due to altered chloride extrusion. =Oncogenesis= Mutations in SLC12A5 are associated with colon cancer. Regulation = Transcriptional regulation: TrkB receptor signalling = KCC2 is transcriptionally downregulated following central nervous system injury by the TrkB receptor signalling transduction cascade (activated by BDNF and NT-4/5). = Post-translational regulation: phosphorylation = It is conventionally thought that phosphorylation inactivates or downregulates KCC2, however there is recent evidence to suggest that phosphorylation at different sites on the KCC2 protein determines different regulational outcomes: *Wnk1/Wnk3 and tyrosine kinase (i.e. TrkB) phosphorylation downregulates KCC2 activity. *PKC phosphorylation of the C-terminus Ser940 residue of the KCC2 protein upregulates KCC2 activity by increasing surface stability. Conversely, Ser940 dephosphorylation leads to enhanced membrane diffusion and endocytosis of KCC2. KCC2 has an extremely high rate of turnover at the plasmalemma (minutes), suggesting that phosphorylation serves as the primary mechanism for rapid regulation. = Activity-dependent downregulation = KCC2 is downregulated by excitatory glutamate activity on NMDA receptor activity and Ca2+ influx. This process involves rapid dephosphorylation on Ser940 and calpain protease cleavage of KCC2, leading to enhanced membrane diffusion and endocytosis of the transporter, as demonstrated in experiments using single particle tracking. Glutamate release occurs not only at excitatory synapses, but is also known to occur after neuronal damage or ischemic insult. Thus, activity-dependent downregulation may be the underlying mechanism by which KCC2 downregulation occurs following central nervous system injury.

Neurolysin has also been implicated in pain control, blood pressure regulation, sepsis, reproduction, cancer biology pathogenesis of stroke, and glucose metabolism.  Structure  = Gene = The NLN gene lies on the chromosome location of 5q12.3 and consists of 14 exons. = Protein = Neurolysin, with 704 amino acid residues, is a zinc metalloendopeptidase with a conserved HEXXH motif. It has an overall prolate ellipsoid shape, with a deep narrow channel dividing it into two roughly equal domains. The catalytic site is contained within a thermolysin- like region found in many metallopeptidases and located in the domain near the floor of the channel.  Function  Neurolysin hydrolyzes only peptides containing 5-17 amino acids by cleaving at a limited set of sites. The specificity of neurolysin for small bioactive peptides is due to the presence of large structural elements erected over its active site region that allow substrates access only through a deep narrow channel. In vitro, neurolysin exemplifies the ability of some neuropeptidases to target diverse cleavage site sequences. In vivo, their most established role is cleaving neurotensin between its 10th and 11th residues to produce inactive fragments and it has been recently identified as a non-AT1-non-AT2 angiotensin-binding site, with function pertaining to the rennin-angiotensin system. Neurotensin is involved in many processes including mast cell degranulation and regulation of central nervous system dopaminergic and cholinergic circuits. A lower level of neurotensin is associated with schizophrenia, and it is implicated in cardiovascular disorders, addiction, Huntington disease and Parkinson disease.

MTA3 protein localizes in the nucleus as well as in other cellular compartments MTA3 is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylate (NuRD) complex and participates in gene expression. The expression pattern of MTA3 is opposite to that of MTA1 and MTA2 during mammary gland tumorigenesis. However, MTA3 is also overexpressed in a variety of human cancers.  Discovery  Mouse Mta3 was initially identified as a partial cDNA with open reading frames in screening of a mouse keratinocyte cDNA library with a human MTA1 partial fragment by My G. Mahoney's research team. The full length Mta3 cDNA was cloned through 5'-RACE methodology using RNA from C57B1/6J mouse skin. The deduced amino acids and its comparison with the sequences in the GeneBank established MTA3 as the third MTA family member.  Gene and spliced variants  The Mta3 is localized on chromosome 12p in mice and MTA3 on 2p21 in human. The human MTA3 gene contains 20 exons, and 19 alternative spliced transcripts. Of these, nine MTA3 transcripts are predicted to code six proteins of 392, 514, 515, 537, 590 and 594 amino acids long, two MTA3 transcripts code 18 amino acids and 91 amino acids polypeptides. The remaining 10 transcripts are non-coding RNAs. The murine Mta3 gene contains nine transcripts, six of which are predicted to code proteins ranging from 251 amino acids to 591 amino acids while one transcript codes for 40 amino acids polypeptide. The murine Mta3 gene contains two predicted non-coding RNAs.  Structure  The overall organization of MTA3 protein domains is similar to the other two family members with a BAH (Bromo-Adjacent Homology), an ELM2 (egl-27 and MTA1 homology), a SANT (SWI, ADA2, N-CoR, TFIIIB-B), a GATA-like zinc finger, and one predicted bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). The SH3 motif of Mta3 allows it to interact with Fyn and Grb2 ‚Äì both SH3 containing signaling proteins.  Function  Functions of MTA3 are believed to be differentially regulated in the context of cancer-types. For example, MTA3 expression is downregulated in breast cancer and endometrioid adenocarcinomas. MTA3 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer and human placenta and chorionic carcinoma cells. In breast cancer, loss of MTA3 promotes EMT and invasiveness of breast cancer cells via upregulating Snail, which in turn represses E-cadherin adhesion molecule. In the mammary epithelium and breast cancer cells, MTA3 is an estrogen regulated gene and part of a larger regulatory network involving MTA1 and MTAs, all modifiers of hormone response, and participate in the processes involved in growth and differentiation. Accordingly, the MTA3-NuRD complex regulates the expression of Wnt4 in mammary epithelial cells and mice, and controls Wnt4-dependent ductal morphogenesis. In contrast to its repressive actions, MTA3 also stimulates the expression of HIF1Œ± as well as its target genes under hypoxic conditions in trophoblasts and is thought to be involved in differentiation during pregnancy. MTA3-NuRD complex and downstream targets have been shown to participate in primitive hematopoietic and angiogenesis in a zebrafish model system As a part of BCL6 corepressor complex, MTA3 regulates BCL6-dependent repression of target genes, including PRDM1, and modulates the differentiation of B-cells.  Regulation  The estrogen receptor-stimulates the expression of MTA3 in breast cancer cells. The SP1 transcription factor stimulates the transcription of MTA3. MicroRNA-495 inhibits the level of MTA3 mRNA as well as the growth and migration of non-small cell lung cancer cells. The Œ≤-elemene - a traditional Chinese medicine, upregulates MTA3's expression in breast cancer cells  Targets  The MTA3-NuRD complex represses Snail, a master regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), Wnt4 expression in mammary epithelial cells, and BCL6-corepressor target genes The MTA3-NuRD complex interacts with GATA3 to regulate the expression of GATA3 downstream targets. In addition, MTA3 upregulates HIF1 and its transactivation activity in hypoxic conditions.

The screenplay by Julien Josephson and Ernest Pascal was based on a story by Rudyard Kipling. The film's story concerns the British presence in 19th-century India. The production was filmed largely at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, where a number of elaborate sets were built for the movie. The film is noteworthy for not having any elaborate song or dance routines which had become staples in Temple's films for 20th Century Fox. William S. Darling and David S. Hall were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction. Plot During the British Raj, Sergeant Donald MacDuff escorts Joyce Williams, an impoverished widow, and her young daughter, Priscilla, to a remote military outpost on the northern frontier of India, to live with her stern father-in-law, Colonel Williams. Along the way, they witness the capture of notorious rebel chief Khoda Khan. Soon, Priscilla, nicknamed 'Wee Willie Winkie' by MacDuff, wins the hearts of all the soldiers, especially her grandfather and MacDuff; even Khoda Khan is touched by her visits to cheer him up in his captivity. Meanwhile, her mother is courted by Lieutenant Brandes. Khoda Khan is rescued by his men in a daring night raid and a fight breaks out. MacDuff is fatally wounded while out on patrol. He passes away in the hospital while Priscilla sings \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" to him. Priscilla decides to persuade Khoda Khan to stop fighting when Mohammed-din, a soldier who is actually Khan's spy, smuggles her out of the base and takes her to the rebel mountain fortress. Khoda Khan is greatly pleased; he thinks that the colonel will bring his entire regiment in a hopeless attempt to rescue her. Colonel Williams halts his force out of range and walks alone to the entrance. A few of Khan's men start shooting at Williams, and Priscilla rushes to her grandfather's side. Impressed by the colonel's courage and overcome with empathy for the child, Khoda Khan orders his men to stop firing. He agrees to negotiate and the war ends.

Reception Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times called the film \\"a pleasing enough little fiction, sure to delight every Temple addict and likely to win the grudging approval even of those who, like myself, are biding their time until she grows up, becomes gawky and is a has-been at 15.\\" Variety praised the film's \\"realistic and elaborate backgrounds and tense reality\\", as well as \\"good comedy\\" between Temple and McLaglen, but suggested that the film was too long for Temple's younger fans to be able to sit through. Harrison's Reports wrote \\"Very good! Although Shirley, as usual, predominates, the producers have wisely surrounded her with capable players...The story has comedy, romance, and thrills, and holds one's attention throughout.\\" John Mosher wrote that the film \\"isn't much as a Shirley Temple tryout...Miss Temple's talent is rather overexploited at times, and she seems just a bit too pert.\\" Libel action against Graham Greene On 29 March 1938, 20th Century Fox was awarded ¬£3,500 in a trial for civil libel brought against British novelist Graham Greene, who was judged to have written an extremely suggestive and defamatory review of Wee Willie Winkie for the magazine Night and Day.Andrew Johnson \\"Shirley Temple scandal was real reason Graham Greene fled to Mexico\\", The Independent on Sunday, 18 November 2007Atkinson, Michael (August 21, 2009 ) \\"Our Man in London.\\" Moving Image Source.

Function  This gene encodes a member of the highly conserved Aurora subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases with two other members, Aurora A and Aurora B. The encoded protein is a chromosomal passenger protein that forms complexes with Aurora-B and inner centromere proteins and may play a role in organizing microtubules in relation to centrosome/spindle function during mitosis. This gene is overexpressed in several cancer cell lines, suggesting an involvement in oncogenic signal transduction. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.  Function  Temporal expression patterns and subcellular localization of Aurora kinases in mitotic cells from G2 to cytokinesis indicate association with mitotic and meiotic structure. Although yeast contain only one Aurora kinase and C. elegans and Drosophila contain only two, mammals have three Aurora kinases with 67-76% homology that are structurally similar and localize similarly. Aurora C localizes to the centrosome and then to the midzone of mitotic cells from anaphase to cytokinesis. It is expressed about an order of magnitude less than Aurora B in diploid human fibroblasts, with mRNA and protein concentrations peaking during the G2/M phase. Aurora C levels, however, peak after those of Aurora B later in the M phase. While Aurora A and B are expressed in mitotic somatic cells, Aurora C is more often expressed during meiosis (spermatogenesis and oogenesis). Aurora B kinase regulates kinetochore maturation, destabilization of improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments, and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), central spindle organization, and cytokinesis. Aneuploidy results from independent and simultaneous inhibition of Aurora B and Aurora C. Slattery et al. found that they have overlapping functions and that Aurora C was able to rescue Aurora B-deficient mitotic cells from aneuploidy. Clinical Significance Expression is typically limited to meiotic cells, but overexpression occurs in some cancer cell lines. PLZF, a transcription repressor, and its CpG island methylation are the most studied modes of regulating AURKC regulation. Although all of the Aurora kinases are overexpressed in many cancer cell lines, only Aurora A and C possess oncogenic activity, producing multinucleated cells and tumors in vivo when overexpressed. When cells overexpressing Aurora C were treated with nocodazole to turn on the SAC, Aurora B protein stability and activity decreased. This then prevented activation of SAC protein BubR1 and phosphorylation of histone H3 and MCAK. Inactivating mutations of Aurora C have been shown to cause infertility in men characterized by macrocephalic and multiflagellular spermatozoa. Homozygous and heterozygous c.144delC mutation in the AURKC gene was found with an allelic frequency of 2.14% in Moroccan men with unexplained spermatogenic failure. The heterozygous state had a frequency of 1% in normospermic fertile men. Although c.144delC represents 85.5% of mutant alleles, the nonsense mutation p.Y248* (13% of all mutant alleles) is present in both European and African men and can lead to infertility. Klinefelter syndrome and Y chromosome microdeletion analyses are the most common genetic tests offered to infertile men, but AURKC and DPY19L2 defects are the leading cause of infertility in North African men.  Interactions  Both Aurora B and C interact with the inner centromere protein (INCENP) from the C-terminal to the conserved IN box domain, but Aurora B preferentially binds INCENP. The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), essential for chromosome segregation, contains the four subunits: the Aurora kinase, INCENP, survivin, and borealin (also known as dasra). Co-expression of Aurora B and C in vivo interferes with INCENP binding, localization, and stability.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types and highly significantly expressed in lung and placenta. TCF21 is crucial for the development of a number of cell types during embryogenesis of the heart, lung, kidney, and spleen. TCF21 is also deregulated in several types of cancers, and thus known to function as a tumor suppressor. The TCF21 gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Discovery  TCF21 was discovered in 1998 when search for novel cell-type- specific bHLH proteins expressed in human and mouse kidneys by performing a search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. Because the transcript they found was highly expressed in visceral glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes), TCF21 was initialled named Pod-1. Comparison of Pod-1 with previously characterized bHLH proteins identified Pod-1 as a novel member of a subfamily of bHLH proteins with important roles in mesodermal development. The chromosomal location of Pod-1 in the mouse was then determined using an interspecific backcross panel along with genomic southern blot analysis to identify restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between inbred mouse strains. Analysis showed Pod-1 to map to a region of mouse chromosome 10 that is syntenic with human chromosome 6q23-q24. The tissue distribution of Pod-1 was determined by hybridization of a human multiple tissue northern blot with a Pod-1 cDNA. A probe lacking the bHLH domain was used to minimize cross- reactivity along with high stringency hybridization and washing. Results showed that in humans and mice, Pod-1 was most highly expressed in the kidney, lung and heart, with selective expression at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction in the kidney, lung, intestine and pancreas of developing mouse embryos. RNA in situ hybridization using 33P-labeled riboprobes was used to identify the cell types that expressed Pod-1 in the developing kidney and other tissues. This revealed Pod-1 expression in mesenchymal cells and podocytes, with expression coinciding with the onset of podocyte differentiation. It was found that expression of Pod-1 in embryonic kidney explants was inhibited through antisense oligonucleotides. This inhibition resulted in decreased mesenchymal cell condensation around the ureteric bud and a significant decrease in ureteric branching. Pod-1 was the first tissue- restricted bHLH protein to be identified in the developing kidney and tied to regulation of morphogenetic events. In an effort to identify novel bHLH factors related to dHAND and eHAND (a novel subclass of cell type-restricted bHLH factors shown to play important roles in cardiac morphogenesis), they screened expressed sequence tag (EST) databases for sequences with homology to the bHLH regions of these factors. The novel bHLH protein they identified in their search was also Pod-1, but they used the name capsulin. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of Capsulin transcripts were used to define sites of expression, which showed to be specific to mesodermal precursor cells that surround the epithelium of the developing gastrointestinal, genitourinary and respiratory systems during mouse embryogenesis. Expression patterns of capsulin mRNA in adult mouse tissues by Northern blot detected highest levels in the lungs, with lower levels in kidneys, heart and spleen. Capsulin transcripts were also found to mark the spiral septum of the heart and progenitor cells that give rise to the pericardium and coronary arteries. Capsulin was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence and absence of the widely expressed bHLH protein E12 and performed gel mobility shift assays with several E-box sequences as probes to test the protein's DNA binding activity. Capsulin alone failed to bind any of the sequences tested. However, in the presence of E12 plus capsulin, a DNA complex was generated with the probe that migrated faster than the E12 homodimeric complex alone, representing the binding of capsulin/E12 heterodimers. It was concluded that capsulin heterodimerizes with E12 and binds the specific E-box consensus sequence (CANNTG), though not activating transcription through this sequence on its own. Its restricted expression pattern and DNA binding activity identified Capsulin as a regulator of gene expression in specific subtypes of visceral mesodermal cells involved in organogenesis and in precursor cells that contribute to the pericardium, coronary arteries and regions of the heart.  Structure  = Gene = The TCF21 gene resides on chromosome 6 at the band 6q23.2 and includes 3 exons. These three exons are associated with CpG islands CGI1, CGI2, and CGI3. DNA methylation analysis revealed hypermethylation at CGI1 and CGI3, but not CGI2 in samples from various cancer tissues. Luciferase reporter assays with constructs covering CGI3 sequences in sense and antisense orientation demonstrated that CGI3 harbors a promoter that directs the synthesis of a previously unknown long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in antisense orientation to TCF21. This lncRNA has been named TARID (for TCF21 antisense RNA inducing demethylation). = Protein = TCF21 is a member of the bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) family of transcription factors. This protein is predicted to span 179 amino acid residues and contains a bHLH domain and an arginine-rich sequence that may facilitate DNA binding.  Function  The third CGI of TCF21 contains a promoter that directs transcription of TARID (a lncRNA) in antisense orientation to TCF21. TARID then induces TET protein-dependent DNA demethylation, thus activating TCF21 transcription. This mechanism is regulated by the binding of TARID to the TCF21 promoter, which recruits GADD45A/TDG to direct BER for demethylation. TCF21 encodes a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, which manages cell-fate specification, commitment and differentiation in various cell lineages during development. The TCF21 product is mesoderm- specific and expressed in embryonic epicardium, mesenchyme-derived tissues of lung, gut, gonad, and both mesenchymal and glomerular epithelial cells in the kidney. TCF21 is essential for regulating properties of the mesenchyme that are critically important for several aspects of lung and kidney morphogenesis. TCF21 is also essential for cardiac fibroblast cell fate, as demonstrated by the failed development of cardiac fibroblasts in mice lacking TCF21. In the absence of TCF21, these fibroblast progenitor cells do not undergo epithelial- to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While TCF21-expressing epicardial cells are initially multipotent, they become committed to the fibroblast lineage over time. Those TCF21-expressing cells that do not commit to the fibroblast lineage lose this expression and remain undifferentiated epicardial cells or coronary vascular smooth muscle cells. TCF21 is expressed in mesodermal cells in the proepicardial organ that give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC) and loss of TCF21 results in increased expression of smooth muscle markers by cells on the heart surface consistent with premature SMC differentiation. This suggests that early expression of TCF21 is important for expansion of the SMC compartment of the coronary circulation, with persistent TCF21 expression being required for cardiac fibroblast development. TCF21 activation is directed by an antisense long non-coding RNA, TARID (TCF21 antisense RNA inducing demethylation). TARID activates TCF21 expression by inducing promoter demethylation and affects expression levels of target genes by functioning as epigenetic regulators of chromatin structure through interactions with histone modifiers, chromatin remodeling complexes, transcriptional regulators, and/or DNA methylation machinery. = Role in development = Since the identification of Tcf21 significance in various cell lineages, further research has expanded understanding of the essential roles of this gene. TCF21 is essential for regulating properties of the mesenchyme that are critically important for several aspects of lung and kidney morphogenesis. Null TCF21 mutant mice are born but die shortly after due to severely hypoplastic lungs and kidneys that lack alveoli and mature glomeruli. While TCF21 is exclusively expressed in the mesenchyme and podocytes, major defects are observed in adjacent epithelia of TCF21 mutant mice. In the kidney, TCF21 is required for conversion of condensing mesenchyme to epithelium of the nephron, branching morphogenesis and terminal differentiation of tubular epithelium. In the lung, TCF21 is required to correctly pattern the proximodistal axis of airway epithelium and for normal branching to occur. TCF21 null mice also fail to form a spleen, as TCF21 acts after splenic specification to control morphogenetic expansion of the splenic anlage and in its absence, splenic precursor cells undergo apoptosis. Since this splenic phenotype resembles that of mice lacking the homeobox genes Hox11 and Bapx1, it is possible that TCF21, together with Hox11, and Bapx1 control a common essential early step in the developmental pathway for spleen organogenesis. TCF21 is essential for cardiac fibroblast cell fate, as demonstrated by the failed development of cardiac fibroblasts in mice lacking TCF21. In the absence of TCF21, these fibroblast progenitor cells do not undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While TCF21-expressing epicardial cells are initially multipotent, they become committed to the fibroblast lineage over time. Those TCF21-expressing cells that do not commit to the fibroblast lineage lose this expression and remain undifferentiated epicardial cells or coronary vascular smooth muscle cells. TCF21 is expressed in mesodermal cells in the proepicardial organ that give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC) and loss of TCF21 results in increased expression of smooth muscle markers by cells on the heart surface consistent with premature SMC differentiation. This suggests that early expression of TCF21 is important for expansion of the SMC compartment of the coronary circulation, with persistent TCF21 expression being required for cardiac fibroblast development. Male TCF21 knockout mice, which die at birth due to respiratory failure, are reported to have feminized genitalia, implicating TCF21 in mouse gonadal development/differentiation. TCF21 transcriptionally represses steroidogenic factor 1 (Sf1), a gene expression regulator that mediates sexual differentiation and is involved in coordinating cell fate decisions in gonadal progenitors. Without TCF21, normal gonad development is disrupted as a result of ectopic expression of Sf1, which leads to abnormal committing of urogenital progenitor cells to steroidogenic cell fates. In the XY gonad, this disruption in organization contributes to changes in testicular structure and vasculature.  Clinical significance  = As a cancer suppressor = In humans, TCF21 has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene and is frequently epigenetically silenced in various human cancers. Restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS) along a region of recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 6q23-q24 to profile DNA methylation was used to test the hypothesis that abnormal promoter methylation could help pinpoint the location of a candidate tumor suppressor in regions of LOH. 6q23-q24 was the chosen chromosomal region due to frequently described LOH in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) as well as in other tumor types, but with no identified tumor suppressor. Hypermethylation was found to occur frequently in the same RLGS loci in HNSCC and NSCLC. Sodium bisulfite sequencing further identified tumor-specific methylation of TCF21 when compared to normal controls. RNA samples were isolated from tumor tissues and analyzed to correlate the amount of TCF21 mRNA and DNA methylation in the samples. Overall, tumor samples with higher levels of CpG island hypermethylation had decreased TCF21 expression than normal controls. Exogenous expression of TCF21 in cells with silenced endogenous TCF21 loci resulted in a reductions in tumor properties both in vitro and in vivo. Based on these results, it was concluded that TCF21 is a tumor suppressor gene, often silenced by hypermethylation in cancer. TCF21 has also been linked to metastatic melanoma progression through the inhibition of the KISS1 metastasis-suppressor gene. DNA methylation analysis in melanoma patient biopsies has demonstrated downregulation of TCF21 due to promoter hypermethylation, which also correlates with decreased survival in patients suffering from metastatic skin melanoma. TCF21, together with E12 and TCF12, bind the KISS1 promoter, sustaining its activity. Without TCF21 to interact with the KISS1 promoter, KISS1 expression is lost. Melanoma cells overexpressing TCF21 have also been found to display reduced motility compared with vector-only control cells. Tobacco-induced lung cancer research has found TCF21 to be among the genes identified as highly methylated at both high and low concentrations of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC). In the presence genistein, one of the soy-derived bioactive isoflavones, methylation of TCF21 is significantly reduced. Genistein has been known to affect tumorigenesis through epigenetic regulation, such as chromatin configuration and DNA methylation, activating other tumor suppressor genes that affect cancer cell survival. These findings support the hypothesis that increasing hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes such as TCF21 is a potential chemopreventative pathway in tobacco-induced lung cancer. TCF21 may have also therapeutic potential for breast cancer treatment, as downregulation of TCF21 has been implicated in breast cancer tumorigenesis and proliferation. TCF21 mRNA expression is very low in breast cancer cells compared with normal breast epithelial cells. This low expression is also associated with large tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Breast cancer tissues exhibit significantly downregulated expression of TCF21 mRNA and TCF21 mRNA overexpression has been found to inhibit cancerous cell proliferation. = Clinical marker = TCF21 methylation has been considered as a potential clinical marker in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Accordingly, TCF21 methylation levels in urine samples may be a useful means of diagnosing renal cell carcinoma. Also TCF21 rs12190287 polymorphism can regulate TCF21 expression and may serve as a potential marker for genetic susceptibility to breast cancer. Additionally, a multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the TCF21 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).

Previously, this coregulator was believed to be present only in brown adipose tissue, but more recent studies have shown that PRDM16 is highly expressed in subcutaneous white adipose tissue as well.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger transcription factor. PRDM16 controls the cell fate between muscle and brown fat cells. Loss of PRDM16 from brown fat precursors causes a loss of brown fat characteristics and promotes muscle differentiation.  Clinical significance  The reciprocal translocation t(1;3)(p36;q21) occurs in a subset of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This gene is located near the 1p36.3 breakpoint and has been shown to be specifically expressed in the t(1:3)(p36,q21)-positive MDS/AML. The protein encoded by this gene contains an N-terminal PR domain. The translocation results in the overexpression of a truncated version of this protein that lacks the PR domain, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported. PRDM16 in BAT Brown adipose tissue (BAT) oxidizes chemical energy to produce heat. This heat energy can act as a defense against hypothermia and obesity. PRDM16 is highly enriched in brown adipose cells as compared to white adipose cells, and plays a role in these thermogenic processes in brown adipose tissue. PRDM16 activates brown fat cell identity and can control the determination of brown adipose fate. A knock-out of PRDM16 in mice shows a loss of brown cell characteristics, showing that PRDM16 activity is important in determining brown adipose fate. Brown adipocytes consist of densely packed mitochondria that contain uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1). UCP-1 plays a key role in brown adipocyte thermogenesis. The presence of PRDM16 in adipose tissue causes a significant up-regulation of thermogenic genes, such as UCP-1 and CIDEA, resulting in thermogenic heat production. Understanding and stimulating the thermogenic processes in brown adipocytes provides possible therapeutic options for treating obesity. PRDM16 in WAT White adipose tissue (WAT) primarily stores excess energy in the form of triglycerides. Recent research has shown that PRDM16 is present in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. The activity of PRDM16 in white adipose tissue leads to the production of brown fat-like adipocytes within white adipose tissue, called beige cells (also called brite cells). These beige cells have a brown adipose tissue-like phenotype and actions, including thermogenic processes seen in BAT. In mice, the levels of PRDM16 within WAT, specifically anterior subcutaneous WAT and inguinal subcutaneous WAT, is about 50% that of interscapular BAT, both in protein expression and in mRNA quantity. This expression takes place primarily within mature adipocytes. Transgenic aP2-PRDM16 mice were used in a study to observe the effects of PRDM16 expression in WAT. The study found that the presence of PRDM16 in subcutaneous WAT leads to a significant up-regulation of brown-fat selective genes UCP-1, CIDEA, and PPARGC1A. This up-regulation lead to the development of a BAT-like phenotype within the white adipose tissue. Expression of PRDM16 has also been shown to protect against high-fat diet induced weight gain. Seale et al.‚Äôs experiment with aP2-PRDM16 transgenic mice and wild type mice showed that transgenic mice eating a 60% high-fat diet had significantly less weight gain than wild type mice on the same diet. Seale et al. determined the weight difference was not due to differences in food intake, as both transgenic and wild type mice were consuming the same amount of food on a daily basis. Rather, the weight difference stemmed from higher energy expenditure in the transgenic mice. Another of Seale et al.‚Äôs experiments showed the transgenic mice consumed a greater volume of oxygen over a 72-hour period than the wild type mice, showing a greater amount of energy expenditure in the transgenic mice. This energy expenditure in turn is attributed to PRDM16‚Äôs ability to up-regulate UCP-1 and CIDEA gene expression, resulting in thermogenesis. If human WAT expresses PRDM16 as in mice, this WAT could be a potential target for stimulating energy expenditure and combating obesity.

Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMPs are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. However, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily, attached to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol anchor. In response to bacterial infection or inflammation, the encoded protein is thought to inactivate alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, a major tissue protectant against proteolytic enzymes released by activated neutrophils, facilitating the transendothelial migration of neutrophils to inflammatory sites. The encoded protein may also play a role in tumor invasion and metastasis through activation of MMP2. The gene has previously been referred to as MMP20 but has been renamed MMP25.

Prior to the standardization of nomenclature USP4 was known as UNP, and was one of the first deubiquitinating enzymes to be identified in mammals. In the mouse and human the USP4 protein is encoded by a gene containing 22 exons. This protein is a member of cysteine peptidase family C19. As a deubiquitinating enzyme it is unusual in having the capacity to cleave ubiquitin-proline bonds. This property may reflect structural flexibility in the active site of the enzyme, and may explain its ability to cleave ubiquitin chains of various linkages. USP4 has substrates of important function in a number of cell signalling pathways, including the NF-Œ∫B, TGF-Œ≤, Wnt/Œ≤-catenin, p53, and spliceosome pathways. Other substrates include the adenosine A2A receptor and the Ro52 (TRIM21) protein. USP4 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that bears a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) 766QPQKKKK772 and a nuclear export signal (NES) 133VEVYLLELKL142. Those signals initiate the translocation of USP4 to the nucleus from the cytoplasm and vice versa, respectively.

Much of the print-based media in Peru is over a century old, with some newspapers even dating back to the time of independence. Newspapers The oldest newspaper in Peru is El Peruano, which was founded by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var on October 22, 1825. El Peruano acts as the official newspaper of record, and all laws passed in Peru must be published in the daily. Despite El Peruano's official status, it does not have the largest circulation among Peruvian dailies. Lima-based El Comercio, founded on May 7, 1839, is one of the most important Peruvian newspapers. It is also the oldest privately owned paper in the country. The Mir√≥ Quesada family controls the majority of El Comercio stock. Left-leaning La Rep√∫blica, founded on May 3, 1981, is another important newspaper. La Rep√∫blica ardently opposed the government of Alberto Fujimori, and continues to refer to him as the \\"ex-dictator.\\" La Rep√∫blica was founded and edited by Gustavo Mohme Llona, who was formerly a member of Congress. It is now edited by his son, Gustavo Mohme Seminario. In addition to these two newspapers, there are several other newspapers, including, for example, Peru.21, Correo, and La Raz√≥n, which is extremely pro-Fujimori. There are also several sensationalist tabloids that are considered to be part of the \\"chicha press.\\" Such papers frequently feature women wearing bikinis or less and show pictures of dead bodies on their front pages. During the government of Fujimori, Vladimiro Montesinos secretly purchased the editorial lines of such tabloids through bribery. Le Monde diplomatique also publishes a Peruvian version. According to a readership survey done in Lima in December 2010, the five most widely read newspapers were Trome (1,824.6 thousand readers), Ojo (526.0), El Comercio (467.6), Per√∫21 (293.4), and El Popular (225.8) Radio :See also: Many radio stations exist throughout Peru, including Radio Programas del Per√∫. The history of radio in Peru can be categorized into the first historical period of (1925-1936) when radio transformed from an elite medium to a mass media. The second period (1937-1956) began with the creation of Radio Nacional del Per√∫ with a regulation toward commercial radio broadcast on such topics as entertainment. The period is considered the golden age of radio in Peru. The third period (1956-1980) tried to reconcile radio industry with the newly established television industry. The fourth period (1980-2000) begins with the return of the media companies to their owners, the formation of new networks and corporations, and the development of popular radio. There are a lot of radio stations in Peru. Peruvian listeners prefer FM stations instead of MW and SW stations. Major cities such as Lima, Arequipa and Trujillo have their FM dial full. Since 1990 most of these stations have been acquired by large radio corporations in order to monopolize the dial. Only a very few independent stations survived this wave. As a consequence Peruvian government does not currently give licenses for new frequencies. This is one of the reasons that since late 1990s pirate radios and Internet radios have appeared and are increasing. Television Among Peru's television networks is Frecuencia Latina, which was the subject of considerable controversy and indirectly led to a case being decided by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Frecuencia Latina covered several stories of corruption in the Fujimori government when it was owned by Baruch Ivcher. However, Baruch Ivcher was stripped of his Peruvian citizenship and forced to sell his shares of the channel below market value to pro-Fujimori businessmen. Ivcher took the case to court, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights eventually decided in his favor. Another channel in Peru is Canal N, a 24-hour cable news channel that is a joint venture between El Comercio and Telef√≥nica. Other Peruvian networks include Am√©rica Televisi√≥n, which was purchased by El Comercio and La Rep√∫blica, Panamericana Televisi√≥n, which secretly sold its editorial line to Vladimiro Montesinos, and public broadcasting station TV Per√∫. Internet-only media Internet-only media started in 1995 with some on-demand broadcasts in RealAudio done by Frecuencia Primera RTVN, Red Cientifica Peruana, Peru.Com and Radio Programas. Currently there are over 10 thousand online stations; some of them are Internet Only but some others are just live rebroadcast fm or mW stations. With some exceptions Internet Only stations die just a few weeks or months after they are created. About Internet TV, some VHF stations like Frecuencia Latina and TV PERU broadcast their on-air feeds via Internet. Starting in 2006 some TV stations have appeared like TELURICA and in 2007 Frecuencia Primera RTVN released CANAL 200, using the name as they were created in 1976. TELURICA produces their own Internet Only programmes but CANAL 200 shows just clips and some sample productions.

VPREB1 has also recently been designated CD179A (cluster of differentiation 179A).  Function  CD179a (VpreB) is a 126 aa-long polypeptide with apparent MW of 16-18 kDa. It is expressed selectively at the early stages of B cell development, namely, in proB and early preB cells. CD179a has an Ig V domain-like structure, but lacks the last beta-strand (beta7) of a typical V domain. Instead, it has a carboxyl terminal end that shows no sequence homologies to any other proteins. CD179a associates non- covalently with CD179b (lambda5 or lambda-like) carrying an Ig C domain-like structure to form an Ig light chain-like structure, which is called the surrogate light chain or pseudo light chain. In this complex, the incomplete V domain of CD179a appears to be complemented by the extra beta7 strand of CD179b. On the surface of early preB cells, CD179a/CD179b surrogate light chain is disulfide-linked to membrane-bound Ig mu heavy chain in association with a signal transducer CD79a/CD79b heterodimer to form a B cell receptor- like structure, so-called preB cell receptor (preBCR). Though no CD179a-related human disease or pathology has been reported yet, the deficiency of other components of preB cell receptor such as CD179b, Ig mu heavy chain and CD79a has been shown to result in severe impairment of B cell development and agammaglobulinemia in human. PreBCR transduces signals for: 1) cellular proliferation, differentiation from the proB cell to preB cell stage, 2) allelic exclusion at the Ig heavy chain gene locus, and 3) promotion of Ig light chain gene rearrangements. Thus, preBCR functions as a checkpoint in early B cell development to monitor the production of Ig mu heavy chain through a functional rearrangement of Ig heavy chain gene as well as the potency of Ig mu heavy chain to associate with Ig light chain.

ZIC2 is a member of the Zinc finger of the cerebellum (ZIC) protein family.  Function  ZIC2 is classified as a ZIC protein due to conservation of the five C2H2 zinc fingers, which enables the protein to interact with DNA and proteins.  Clinical significance  Correct function of these proteins is critical for early development, and as such mutations of the genes encoding these proteins is known to result in various congenital defects. For example, mutation of ZIC2 is known to result in holoprosencephaly due to defect in the function of the organizer region (node), which leads to a defective anterior notochord (ANC). The ANC provides a maintenance signal to the Prechordal plate (PCP), thus a defective ANC results in degradation of the PCP, which is normally responsible for sending a shh signal to the developing forebrain resulting in the formation of the two hemispheres. Holoprosencephaly is the most common structural anomaly of the human forebrain. Recently ZIC2 has also been shown to be critical for establishment of the left-right axis, thus loss of ZIC2 function can result in defects in heart formation. Another member of the ZIC family, ZIC3, has previously been linked to establishment of the left- right axis. A polyhistidine tract polymorphism in this gene may be associated with increased risk of neural tube defects (spina bifida). This gene is closely linked to a gene encoding ZIC5, a related family member on chromosome 13.  Interactions  ZIC2 has recently been found to interact with TCF7L2, enabling it to act as a Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signalling inhibitor. Such a role is of critical importance, as not only is correct Wnt signalling critical for early development, Wnt signalling has also been found to be upregulated to several cancers.

CSRP3 IS a small 194 amino acid protein, which is specifically expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In rodents, CSRP3 has also been found to be expressed in neurons.  Gene  The CSRP3 gene was discovered in rat in 1994. In humans it was mapped to chromosome 11p15.1, where it spans a 20kb genomic region, organized in 6 exons. The full length transcript is 0.8kb, while a splice variant, originating from the alternative splicing of exons 3 and 4, was recently identified and designated MLP-b.  Structure  MLP contains two LIM domains (LIM1 and LIM2), each being surrounded by glycine-rich regions, and the two separated by more than 50 residues. LIM domains offer a remarkable ability for protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, MLP carries a nuclear localization signal at amino acid positions 64-69 MLP can be acetylated/deacetylated at the position 69 lysine residue (K69), by acetyltransferase (PCAF) and histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), respectively. In myocytes, MLP has the ability to oligomerize, forming dimers, trimers and tetramers, an attribute that impacts its interactions, localization and function.  Protein interactions and localization  MLP has been identified to bind to an increasing list of proteins, exhibiting variable subcellular localization and diverse functional properties. In particular, MLP interacts with proteins at the: # Z-line, including telethonin (T-cap), alpha-actinin (ACTN), cofilin-2 (CFL2), calcineurin, HDAC4, MLP-b as well as to MLP itself; # costameres, where it binds to zyxin, integrin linked kinase (ILK) and beta1-spectrin; # intercalated discs, where it associates with the nebulin- related anchoring protein (NRAP); # nucleus, where it binds to the transcription factors MyoD, myogenin and MRF4. M-line as well as plasma membrane localization of MLP has also been observed, however, the protein associations mediating this subcellular distribution are currently unknown. These diverse localization patterns and binding partners of MLP suggest a multitude of roles relating both to the striated myocyte cytoskeleton and the nucleus. The role of MLP in each of these two cellular compartments appears to be dynamic, with studies demonstrating nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, driven by its nuclear localization signal, over time and under different conditions.  Function  In the nucleus, MLP acts as a positive regulator of myogenesis and promotes myogenic differentiation. Overexpression of MLP enhances myotube differentiation, an effect attributed to the direct association of MLP with muscle specific transcription factors such as MyoD, myogenin and MRF4 and consequently the transcriptional control of fundamental muscle-specific genes. In the cytoplasm, MLP is an important scaffold protein, implicated in various cytoskeletal macromolecular complexes, at the sarcomeric Z-line, the costameres, and the microfilaments. At the Z-line, MLP interacts with different Z-line components and acts as a scaffold protein promoting the assembly of macromolecular complexes along sarcomeres and actin-based cytoskeleton Moreover, since the Z-line acts as a stretch sensor, MLP is believed to be involved in mechano-signaling processes. Indeed, cardiomyocytes from MLP transgenic or knock-out mouse exhibit defective intrinsic stretch responses, due to selective loss of passive stretch sensing. At the costameres, another region implicated in force transmission, MLP is thought to be contributing in mechanosensing through its interactions with Œ≤1 spectrin and zyxin. However, the precise role of MLP at the costameres has not been extensively investigated yet. At the microfilaments, MLP is implicated in actin remodeling (or actin dynamics) through its interaction with cofilin-2 (CFL2). Binding of MLP to CFL2 enhances the CFL2-dependent F-actin depolymerization, with a recent study demonstrating that MLP can act directly on actin cytoskeleton dynamics through direct binding that stabilizes and crosslinks actin filaments into bundles. Additionally, MLP is indirectly related to calcium homeostasis and energy metabolism. Specifically, acetylation of MLP increases the calcium sensitivity of myofilaments and regulates contractility, while the absence of MLP causes alterations in calcium signaling (intracellular calcium handling) with defects in excitation- contraction coupling. Furthermore, lack of MLP leads to local loss of mitochondria and energy deficiency.  Animal studies  In rodents, MLP is transiently expressed in amacrine cells of the retina during postnatal development. In the adult nervous system it is expressed upon axonal injury, where it plays an important role during regenerative processes, functioning as an actin cross-linker, thereby facilitating filopodia formation and increasing growth cone motility.  Clinical significance  MLP is directly associated with striated muscle diseases. Mutations in the CSRP3 gene have been detected in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) [e.g. G72R and K69R], and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) [e.g. L44P, S46R, S54R/E55G, C58G, R64C, Y66C, Q91L, K42/fs165], while the most frequent MLP mutation, W4R, has been found in both of these patient populations. Biochemical and functional studies have been performed for some of these mutant proteins, and reveal aberrant localization and interaction patterns, leading to impaired molecular and cellular functions. For example, the W4R mutation abolishes the MLP/T-cap interaction, leading to mislocalization of T-cap, Z-line instability and severe sarcomeric structural defects. The C58G mutation causes reduced protein stability due to enhanced ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation while the K69L mutation, which is within the predicted nuclear localization signal of MLP, abolishes the MLP/Œ±-actinin interaction and causes altered subcellular distribution of the mutant protein, showing predominant perinuclear localization. Alterations in the protein expression levels of MLP, its oligomerization or splicing have also been described in human cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases: both MLP protein levels and oligomerization are down-regulated in human heart failure, while MLP levels are significantly changed in different skeletal myopathies, including facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, nemaline myopathy and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B. Moreover, significant changes in MLP-b protein expression levels, as well as deregulation of the MLP:MLP-b ratio have been detected in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and dermatomyositis patients.  Animal models  Animal models are providing insight into MLP's function in striated muscle. Ablation of Mlp (MLP-/-) in mice affects all striated muscles, although the cardiac phenotype is more severe, leading to alterations in cardiac pressure and volume, aberrant contractility, development of dilated cardiomyopathy with hypertrophy and progressive heart failure. At the histological level there is dramatic disruption of the cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture at multiple levels, and pronounced fibrosis. Other cellular changes included alterations in intracellular calcium handling, local loss of mitochondria and energy deficiency. Crossing MLP-/- mice with phospholamban (PLN) -/-, or Œ≤2-adrenergic receptor (Œ≤2-AR) -/-, or angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT1a) -/-, or Œ≤-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 inhibitor (bARK1) -/- mice, as well as overexpressing calcineurin rescued their cardiac function, through a series of only partly understood molecular mechanisms. Conversely crossing MLP-/- mice with Œ≤1-adrenergic receptor (Œ≤1-AR) -/- mice was lethal, while crossing MLP-/- mice with calcineurin -/- mice, enhanced fibrosis and cardiomyopathy. A gene knockin mouse model harboring the human MLP-W4R mutation developed HCM and heart failure, while ultrastructural analysis of its cardiac tissue revealed myocardial disarray and significant fibrosis, increased nuclear localization of MLP concomitantly with reduced sarcomeric Z-line distribution. Alterations in MLP nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, which are possibly modulated by changes in its oligomerization status, have also been implicated in hypertrophy and heart failure, independently of mutations. Studies in Drosophila revealed that genetic ablation of Mlp84B, the Drosophila homolog of MLP, was associated with pupal lethality and impaired muscle function. Mechanical studies of Mlp84B-null flight muscles indicate that loss of Mlp84B results in decreased muscle stiffness and power generation. Cardiac-specific ablation of Mlp84B caused decreased lifespan, impaired diastolic function and disturbances in cardiac rhythm. Overall, these animal models have provided critical evidence on the functional significance of MLP in striated muscle physiology and pathophysiology.

XLF was originally discovered as the protein mutated in five patients with growth retardation, microcephaly, and immunodeficiency. The protein is required for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. Patients with XLF mutations also have immunodeficiency due to a defect in V(D)J recombination, which uses NHEJ to generate diversity in the antibody repertoire of the immune system. XLF interacts with DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 and is thought to be involved in the end-bridging or ligation steps of NHEJ. The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) homolog of XLF is Nej1.  Phenotypes  In contrast to the profound immunodeficiency phenotype of XLF deletion in humans, deletion of XLF alone has a mild phenotype in mice. However, combining a deletion of XLF with deletion of the ATM kinase causes a synthetic defect in NHEJ, suggesting partial redundancy in the function of these two proteins in mice.  Structure  XLF is structurally similar to XRCC4, existing as a constitutive dimer with an N-terminal globular head domain, an alpha-helical stalk, and an unstructured C-terminal region (CTR).  Interactions  XLF has been shown to interact with XRCC4, and with Ku protein, and it can also interact weakly with DNA. Co-crystal structures of XLF and XRCC4 suggest that the two proteins can form hetero-oligomers via head-to-head interaction of alternating XLF and XRCC4 subunits. These XRCC4-XLF filaments have been proposed to bridge DNA prior to end ligation during NHEJ. Formation of XRCC4-XLF oligomers can be disrupted by interaction of the C-terminal domain of XRCC4 with the BRCT domain of DNA ligase IV.  Hematopoietic stem cell aging  Deficiency of NHEJ1 in mice leads to premature aging of hematopoietic stem cells as indicated by several lines of evidence including evidence that long-term repopulation is defective and worsens over time. Using a human induced pluripotent stem cell model of NHEJ1 deficiency, it was shown that NHEJ1 has an important role in promoting survival of the primitive hematopoietic progenitors. These NHEJ1 deficient cells possess a weak NHEJ1-mediated repair capacity that is apparently incapable of coping with DNA damages induced by physiological stress, normal metabolism, and ionizing radiation.

It is important that oral hygiene be carried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad breath. The most common types of dental disease are tooth decay (cavities, dental caries) and gum diseases, including gingivitis, and periodontitis. General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before going to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning between the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth brushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and therefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental brushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use. Sometimes white or straight teeth are associated with oral hygiene. However, a hygienic mouth can have stained teeth or crooked teeth. To improve the appearance of their teeth, people may use tooth whitening treatments and orthodontics. A healthy smile The importance of the role of the oral microbiome in dental health has been increasingly recognized. Data from human oral microbiology research shows that a commensal microflora can switch to an opportunistic pathogenic flora through complex changes in their environment. These changes are driven by the host rather than the bacteria. Archeological evidence of calcified dental plaque shows marked shifts in the oral microbiome towards a disease-associated microbiome with cariogenic bacteria becoming dominant during the Industrial Revolution. Modern oral microbiota are significantly less diverse than historic populations. Caries, for example, have become a major endemic disease, affecting 60-90% of schoolchildren in industrialized countries. In contrast, dental caries and periodontal diseases were rare in pre-Neolithic and early hominins. Tooth cleaning and decay A 1930s poster from the Work Projects Administration promoting oral hygiene Tooth decay is the most common global disease. Over 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach food left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to neutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts of the tooth, where fewer cavities occur. Teeth cleaning is the removal of dental plaque and tartar from teeth to prevent cavities, gingivitis, gum disease, and tooth decay. Severe gum disease causes at least one-third of adult tooth loss. Since before recorded history, a variety of oral hygiene measures have been used for teeth cleaning. This has been verified by various excavations done throughout the world, in which chew sticks, tree twigs, bird feathers, animal bones and porcupine quills have been found. In historic times, different forms of tooth cleaning tools have been used. Indian medicine (Ayurveda) has used the neem tree, or daatun, and its products to create teeth cleaning twigs and similar products; a person chews one end of the neem twig until it somewhat resembles the bristles of a toothbrush, and then uses it to brush the teeth. In the Muslim world, the miswak, or siwak, made from a twig or root, has antiseptic properties and has been widely used since the Islamic Golden Age. Rubbing baking soda or chalk against the teeth was also common; however, this can have negative side effects over time. The Australian Healthcare and Hospital Association's (AHHA) most recent evidence brief ) suggests that dental check-ups should be conducted once every 3 years for adults, and 1 every 2 years for children. It has been documented that dental professionals frequently advise for more frequent visits, but this advice is contraindicated by evidence suggesting that check up frequency should be based on individual risk factors, or the AHHA's check-up schedule. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, tooth polishing, and, if tartar has accumulated, debridement; this is usually followed by a fluoride treatment. However, the American Dental Hygienists' Association (ADHA) stated in 1998 that there is no evidence that scaling and polishing only above the gums provides therapeutic value, and cleaning should be done under the gums as well. The Cochrane Oral Health Group found only three studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in their study and found little evidence in them to support claims of benefits from supragingival (above the gum) tooth scaling or tooth polishing. Dental sealants, which are applied by dentists, cover and protect fissures and grooves in the chewing surfaces of back teeth, preventing food from becoming trapped and thereby halt the decay process. An elastomer strip has been shown to force sealant deeper inside opposing chewing surfaces and can also force fluoride toothpaste inside chewing surfaces to aid in remineralising demineralised teeth. Between cleanings by a dental hygienist, good oral hygiene is essential for preventing tartar build-up which causes the problems mentioned above. This is done through careful, frequent brushing with a toothbrush, combined with the use of dental floss or interdental brushes to prevent accumulation of plaque on the teeth. Powered toothbrushes reduce dental plaque and gingivitis more than manual toothbrushing in both short and long term. Further evidence is needed to determine the clinical importance of these findings. Patients need to be aware of the importance of brushing and flossing their teeth daily. New parents need to be educated to promote healthy habits in their children. Sources of problems =Plaque= Dental plaque, also known as dental biofilm, is a sticky, yellow film consisting of a wide range of bacteria that attaches to the tooth surfaces and can be visible around the gum line. It starts to reappear after the tooth surface has been cleaned, which is why regular brushing is encouraged. A high-sugar diet encourages the formation of plaque. Sugar (fermentable carbohydrates), is converted into acid by the plaque. The acid then causes the breakdown of the adjacent tooth, eventually leading to tooth decay. If plaque is left on a subgingival (under the gum) surface undisturbed, not only is there an increased risk of tooth decay, but it will also go on to irritate the gums and make them appear red and swollen. Some bleeding may be noticed during tooth brushing or flossing. These are the signs of inflammation which indicate poor gum health (gingivitis). = Calculus = The longer that plaque stays on the tooth surface, the harder and more attached to the tooth it becomes. That is when it is referred to as calculus and needs to be removed by a dental professional. If this is not treated, the inflammation will lead to the bone loss and will eventually lead to the affected teeth becoming loose. Preventive care =Tooth brushing= Routine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases, and perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce plaque buildup. Controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from plaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries ‚Äì the three most common oral diseases. The average brushing time for individuals is between 30 seconds and just over 60 seconds.Saxer UP, Barbakow J, Yankell SL. \\"New studies on estimated and actual toothbrushing times and dentifrice use.\\" J Clin Dent 1998;9(2):49‚Äì51Beals D, Ngo T, Feng Y, Cook D, Grau DG, Weber DA. \\"Development and laboratory evaluation of a new toothbrush with a novel brush head design.\\" Am J Dent. 2000;13:5A‚Äì13A Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for a minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day. Brushing for at least two minutes per session is optimal for preventing the most common oral diseases, and removes considerably more plaque than brushing for only 45 seconds Toothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival pockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect the ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of pathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth. Toothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as nano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing. The fluoride (or alternative)in the dentifrice is an important protective factor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize already affected enamel. However, in terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the effectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed. People use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it performs the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is a neurotoxin. Manual tooth brush The modern manual tooth brush is a dental tool which consists of a head of nylon bristles attached to a long handle to help facilitate the manual action of tooth brushing. Furthermore, the handle aids in reaching as far back as teeth erupt in the oral cavity. The tooth brush is arguably a person's best tool for removing dental plaque from teeth, thus capable of preventing all plaque-related diseases if used routinely, correctly and effectively. Oral health professionals recommend the use of a tooth brush with a small head and soft bristles as they are most effective in removing plaque without damaging the gums. The technique is crucial to the effectiveness of tooth brushing and disease prevention. Back and forth brushing is not effective in removing plaque at the gum line. Tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach, angle the bristles at a 45-degree angle towards the gums, and make small circular motions at that angle. This action increases the effectiveness of the technique in removing plaque at the gum line. Electric tooth brush Electric toothbrushes are toothbrushes with moving or vibrating bristle heads. The two main types of electric toothbrushes are the sonic type which has a vibrating head, and the oscillating-rotating type in which the bristle head makes constant clockwise and anti-clockwise movements. Sonic or ultrasonic toothbrushes vibrate at a high frequency with a small amplitude, and a fluid turbulent activity that aids in plaque removal. The rotating type might reduce plaque and gingivitis compared to manual brushing, though it is currently uncertain whether this is of clinical significance. The movements of the bristles and their vibrations help break up chains of bacteria up to 5mm below the gum line. The oscillating-rotating electric toothbrush on the other hand uses the same mechanical action as produced by manual tooth brushing ‚Äì removing plaque via mechanical disturbance of the biofilm ‚Äì however at a higher frequency. Using electric tooth brushes is less complex in regards to brushing technique, making it a viable option for children, and adults with limited dexterity. The bristle head should be guided from tooth to tooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The motion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush or make circles. =Flossing= Tooth brushing alone will not remove plaque from all surfaces of the tooth as 40% of the surfaces are interdental. One technique that can be used to access these areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can remove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The American Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be removed by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of one's daily oral hygiene regime. Types of floss include: * Unwaxed floss: Unbound nylon filaments that spread across the tooth. Plaque and debris get trapped for easy removal. * Waxed floss: less susceptible to tearing or shredding when used between tight contacts or areas with overhanging restorations. * Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon): Slides easily through tight contacts and does not fray. A dental hygienist demonstrates dental flossing. The type of floss used is a personal preference; however, without proper technique it may not be effective. The correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows: # Floss length: 15‚Äì25 cm wrapped around middle fingers. # For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth with both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly an inch is left between the fingers. # Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. # Position the floss in such a way that it becomes securely wrapped around the interdental surface of the tooth in a C shape. # Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up and down motion. There are a few different options on the market that can make flossing easier if dexterity or coordination is a barrier, or as a preference over normal floss. Floss threaders are ideal for cleaning between orthodontic appliances, and flossettes are ideal for children and those with poor dexterity. Special flossettes are made for those with orthodontics. =Interdental brushes= Interdental brushes come in a range of color-coded sizes. They consist of a handle with a piece of wire covered in tapered bristles, designed to be placed into the interdental space for plaque removal. Studies indicate that interdental brushes are equally or more effective then floss when removing plaque and reducing gum inflammation. They are especially recommended to people with orthodontics, often to use as well as floss. The steps in using an interdental brush are as follows: # Identify the size required, the largest size that will fit without force is ideal, if necessary more than one size can be used. # Insert the bristles into the interdental space at a 90-degree angle. # Move the brush back and forth between the teeth. # Rinse under water to remove debris when necessary. # Rinse with warm soapy water once complete, and store in a clean dry area. # Replace once bristles are worn. =Tongue scrapers= The tongue contains numerous bacteria which causes bad breath. Tongue cleaners are designed to remove the debris built up on the tongue. Using a toothbrush to clean the tongue is another possibility, however it might be hard to reach the back of the tongue and the bristles of the toothbrush may be too soft to remove the debris. Steps of using a tongue scraper: # Rinse the tongue scraper in order to clean it and remove any present debris # Start at the back of the tongue and gently scrape forwards. Be sure to clean the sides of the tongue, as well as the middle portion # After the cleaning is completed, rinse the tongue scraper and any debris that is left behind # Rinse the mouth =Oral irrigation= Some dental professionals recommend subgingival irrigation as a way to clean teeth and gums, instead of or in addition to flossing. = Single-tufted brushes = Single-tufted brushes are a tool in conjunction with tooth brushing. The tooth brush is designed to reach the 'hard to reach places' within the mouth. This tool is best used behind the lower front teeth, behind the back molars, crooked teeth and between spaces where teeth have been removed. The single- tufted brush design has an angled handle, a 4mm diameter and rounded bristle tips. =Gum stimulators= Toothbrushes with pointed rubber tips at the ends of the handles have been available for many years, and have more recently been replaced by a standalone tool called a gum stimulator designed to massage the gum line and the bases of the areas between the teeth. Such stimulators help to increase circulation to the gum line and to clear away bacteria which might not be removed by brushing and flossing alone. Food and drink Foods that help muscles and bones also help teeth and gums. Vitamin C is necessary, for example, to prevent scurvy which manifests as serious gum disease. Eating a balanced diet and limiting sugar intake can help prevent tooth decay and periodontal disease. The F√©d√©ration dentaire internationale (FDI World Dental Federation) has promoted foods such as raw vegetables, plain yogurt, cheese, or fruit as dentally beneficial‚Äîthis has been echoed by the American Dental Association (ADA). =Beneficial foods= * Community water fluoridation is the addition of fluoride to adjust the natural fluoride concentration of a community's water supply to the level recommended for optimal dental health, approximately 1.0 ppm (parts per million). Fluoride is a primary protector against dental cavities. Fluoride makes the surface of teeth more resistant to acids during the process of remineralization. Drinking fluoridated water is recommended by some dental professionals while others say that using toothpaste alone is enough. * Milk, cheese, nuts and chicken are also rich in calcium and phosphate, and may also encourage remineralization. * The body can't absorb all the required calcium if lacks vitamin D, so fatty fish (salmon, for instance) as a major source of vitamin D helps your teeth and gums to get more benefits of calcium. * Green and black tea which is richly endowed with polyphenols acts as a suppressor of the bacterias that cause plaque, therefore it helps in sustaining oral health and is advisable during or after a meal. * Foods high in fiber (like vegetables) may help to increase the flow of saliva, and a bolus of fibre like celery string, fresh carrot or broccoli can force saliva into trapped food inside pits and fissures on chewing surfaces where over 80% of cavities occur, to dilute carbohydrates like sugar, neutralize acid and remineralize teeth on easy to reach surfaces. =Harmful foods= Sugars are commonly associated with dental cavities. Other carbohydrates, especially cooked starches, e.g. crisps/potato chips, may also damage teeth, although to a lesser degree (and indirectly) since starch has to be converted to glucose by salivary amylase (an enzyme in the saliva) first. Sugars in foods that are more 'sticky', such as toffee, are likely to cause more damage to teeth than those in less 'sticky' foods, such as certain forms of chocolate or most fruits. *Sucrose (table sugar) is most commonly associated with cavities. The amount of sugar consumed at any one time is less important than how often food and drinks that contain sugar are consumed. The more frequently sugars are consumed, the greater the time during which the tooth is exposed to low pH levels, at which point demineralisation occurs (below 5.5 for most people). It is important therefore to try to encourage infrequent consumption of food and drinks containing sugar so that teeth have a chance to be repaired by remineralisation and fluoride. Limiting sugar- containing foods and drinks to meal times is one way to reduce the incidence of cavities. Sugars from fruit and fruit juices, e.g., glucose, fructose, and maltose can also cause cavities. Sucrose is used by Streptococcus mutans bacteria to produce biofilm. The sucrose is split by glucansucrase, which allows the bacteria to use the resulting glucose for building glucan polymer film and the resulting fructose as fuel to be converted to lactic acid. * Acids contained in fruit juice, vinegar and soft drinks lower the pH level of the oral cavity which causes the enamel to demineralize. Drinking drinks such as orange juice or cola throughout the day raises the risk of dental cavities.[Source?] * Another factor which affects the risk of developing cavities is the stickiness of foods. Some foods or sweets may stick to the teeth and so reduce the pH in the mouth for an extended time, particularly if they are sugary. It is important that teeth be cleaned at least twice a day, preferably with a toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste, to remove any food sticking to the teeth. Regular brushing and the use of dental floss also removes the dental plaque coating the tooth surface. =Chewing gum= Chewing gum assists oral irrigation between and around the teeth, cleaning and removing particles, but for teeth in poor condition it may damage or remove loose fillings as well. Dental chewing gums claim to improve dental health. Sugar-free chewing gum stimulates saliva production, and helps to clean the surface of the teeth. = Ice = Chewing on solid objects such as ice can chip teeth, leading to further tooth fractures. Chewing on ice has been linked to symptoms of anemia. People with anemia tend to want to eat food with no nutritional value. = Alcohol = Drinking dark-colored beverages such as wine or beer may stain teeth, leading to a discolored smile. Drinking high- concentration alcohol can lead to a dry mouth, with little saliva to protect the teeth from plaque and bacteria. Other Smoking is one of the leading risk factors associated with periodontal diseases. It is thought that smoking impairs and alters normal immune responses, eliciting destructive processes while inhibiting reparative responses promoting the incidence and development of periodontal diseases. Regular vomiting, as seen in bulimia nervosa and morning sickness also causes significant damage, due to acid erosion. Mouthwash There are three commonly used kinds of mouthwash: saline (salty water), essential oils (Listerine, etc.), and chlorhexidine gluconate. =Saline= Saline (warm salty water) is usually recommended after procedures like dental extractions. In a study completed in 2014, warm saline mouthrinse was compared to no mouthrinse in preventing alveolar osteitis (dry socket) after extraction. In the group that was instructed to rinse with saline, the prevalence of alveolar osteitis was less than in the group that did not. =Essential oils (EO) or cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC)= Essential oils, found in Listerine mouthwash, contains eucalyptol, menthol, thymol, and methyl salicylate. CPC containing mouthwash contains cetyl pyridinium chloride, found in brands such as Colgate Plax, Crest Pro Health, Oral B Pro Health Rinse. In a meta-analyses completed in 2016, EO and CPC mouthrinses were compared and it was found that plaque and gingivitis levels were lower with EO mouthrinse when used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque removal (toothbrushing and interdental cleaning). =Chlorhexidine= Chlorhexidine gluconate is an antiseptic mouthrinse that should only be used in two-week time periods due to brown staining on the teeth and tongue.Strydonck DA, Slot DE, Velden U, Weijden F. \\"Effect of a chlorhexidine mouthrinse on plaque, gingival inflammation and staining in gingivitis patients: a systematic review.\\" Journal of Clinical Periodontology. 2012;39(11):1042‚Äì1055. Compared to essential oils, it is more efficacious in controlling plaque levels, but has no better effect on gingivitis and is therefore generally used for post-surgical wound healing or the short-term control of plaque. =Sodium hypochlorite= As mentioned earlier, sodium hypochlorite, a common household bleach, can be used as a 0.2% solution for 30 seconds two or three times a week as a cheap and effective means of combating harmful bacteria. The commercial product is 5% or 6%, so this requires diluting the product by a factor of about 30 (half a tablespoon in a full glass of water). The solution will lose activity with time and may be discarded after one day. Appliances care =Dentures= Dentures must be kept extremely clean. It is recommended that dentures be cleaned mechanically twice a day with a soft-bristled brush and denture cleansing paste. It is not recommended to use toothpaste, as it is too abrasive for acrylic, and will leave plaque retentive scratches in the surface. Dentures should be taken out at night, as leaving them in whilst sleeping has been linked to poor oral health. Leaving a denture in during sleep reduces the protective cleansing and antibacterial properties of saliva against Candida albicans (oral thrush) and denture stomatitis; the inflammation and redness of the oral mucosa underneath the denture. For the elderly, wearing a denture during sleep has been proven to greatly increase the risk of pneumonia. It is now recommended that dentures should be stored in a dry container overnight, as keeping dentures dry for 8 hours significantly reduces the amount of Candida albicans on an acrylic denture. Approximately once a week it is recommended to soak a denture overnight with an alkaline-peroxide denture cleansing tablet, as this has been proved to reduce bacterial mass and pathogenicity. =Retainers= As with dentures, it is recommended to clean retainers properly at least once a day (avoiding toothpaste and using soap) and to soak them overnight with an alkaline-peroxide denture cleansing tablet once a week. Hot temperatures will warp the shape of the retainer, therefore rinsing under cold water is preferred. Keeping the retainer in a plastic case and rinsing it beforehand considered to help reduce the number of bacteria being transferred back into the mouth. =Braces= While undertaking the braces treatment, it is recommended to use a small-sized or specialized toothbrush with a soft head to access hard-to-reach areas. Brushing after every meal is highly advisable. Regular flossing is as important as brushing, and helps to remove any plaque build-up, as well as smaller food particles that are stuck in your braces or between your teeth. Floss threaders for braces or interdental brushes are also an option.  Education  To become a dental hygienist in the US one must attend a college or university that is approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation and take the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination. There are several degrees one may receive. An associate degree after attending community college is the most common and only takes two years to obtain. After doing so, one may work in a dental office. There is also the option of receiving a bachelor's degree or master's degree if one plans to work in an educational institute either for teaching or research. Oral hygiene and systemic diseases Several recent clinical studies suggest oral disease and inflammation (oral bacteria & oral infections) may be a risk factor for serious systemic diseases, such as: * cardiovascular disease (heart attack and Stroke) * bacterial pneumonia: Oral hygiene care for critically ill patients has been reported to reduce the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia. * low birth weight or extreme high birth weight of one's baby * diabetes complications * osteoporosis  See also  * Dental floss *Mouth breathing * Obligate nasal breathing * Periodontology * Tooth brushing * List of oral health and dental topics * List of basic dentistry topics  References   External links  * World Health Organization site on oral health Category:Periodontology ","title":"Oral hygiene"},{"id":"14878728","text":"Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD7 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the SETD7 gene.

The school is widely known for its International Baccalaureate Diploma Program which it has used since 2000. It is currently the only IB World School in Tunisia. History The American Cooperative School of Tunis was founded in 1959, originally as an American Elementary School only teaching Grades PreK-8. A ninth grade was added in 1982 and a tenth grade in 1993. Eleventh and twelfth grade were added in 1995 and 1996 respectively with the first graduating class being the class of June 1997. The school's enrolment increased dramatically following the temporary relocation of the African Development Bank from its headquarters in Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire to Tunis, Tunisia in 2003. Following attacks on the nearby US Embassy, protesters torched the school building containing the Elementary School Library on September 14, 2012. Fire and smoke damage spread to 12 adjoining classrooms rendering them unsafe. The entire block was condemned. The remainder of the campus was ransacked and looted for several hours resulting in over $5.5 million in estimated damages and loss. However, the school commenced within a few days and is now back and flourishing better than ever, thanks to rebuilding efforts from the many countries and persons involved. Facilities ACST is located on a campus with completely new or renovated building dedicated to pre-school, elementary, middle and high school. A three- year expansion project was completed in May 2006 and includes a new elementary playground space with new equipment, an amphitheatre and green space. A new facility in currently in the works and should be finished in 2016/17. The admin/preschool building contains an elementary library with an amphitheater and elementary computer lab. For the secondary school there are two science labs, two computer labs, two art rooms and the main library with more than 12,000 volumes and a computer research area. Other buildings house a large music classroom, school store, copy center and warehouse. The school has a full gym/auditorium (with three classrooms), a second newly constructed gym, a cafeteria and a regulation sized grass-covered soccer/softball field with a 300-meter track being renovated this year. An on-campus parking garage for 74 vehicles was constructed last school year. ACST shares use of a newly constructed 25-meter swimming pool located at the nearby United States Embassy to Tunisia. Bus transportation is available to and from the school from most residential areas of Tunis, La Marsa, Gammarth, El Manar and Carthage. Secondary School The American Cooperative School of Tunis has American style high school graduation requirements offering their own \\"ACST Diploma\\" in addition to the International Baccalaureate Diploma. The ACST Diploma can be obtained by earning credits. These credits consist of four credits of English, Social Studies, and Mathematics as well as three credits of Science. In addition, two credits of Foreign Language, two credits of Physical Education, one course of Art, Music, Technology, and Health are also required. An additional four credits must be obtained by taking other courses to earn the required total of 24. Earning the International Baccalaureate Diploma constitutes automatic fulfilment of the ACST Diploma requirements. =Initial years= The initial years of the ACST high school also known as grades 9 and 10 or Freshman and Sophomore years consist of American style high school courses designed for 14- to 16-year-olds created and regulated solely by ACST. The school offers English, Math, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and ESS as core subjects. ACST also offers electives that students may take in addition to the core subject. The high school electives for the 2007‚Äì2008 school year include: Music, Art, Advanced Art, Modern Standard Arabic, Technology, Model United Nations, Drama, Introduction to Research, 20th Century African History, and German. =IB Diploma Program= A basic IB Diploma Program is offered to all students in Grades 11 and 12 (or junior and senior) years as well as American style high school electives for non-IB Diploma students who only seek the ACST Diploma. The school grades student using both their own American style grading scale as well as having their students take the IB Exams which are externally marked by the International Baccalaureat Organization.

IFITM1 has also recently been designated CD225 (cluster of differentiation 225). This protein has several additional names: fragilis (human homolog of the mouse protein), IFI17 [interferon-induced protein 17], 9-27 [Interferon-inducible protein 9-27] and Leu13. IFITM1 is a member of the IFITM family (Interferon-induced transmembrane protein) which is encoded by IFITM genes. The human IFITM genes locate on chromosome 11 and have four members: IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3 and IFITM5. While the mouse Ifitm genes locate on chromosome 7 and 16 and have six members: Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3, Ifitm5, Ifitm6 and Ifitm7.  Molecular biology  The IFITM1 gene is located on the Watson (plus) strand of the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5) and is 3,956 bases in length. The encoded protein has 125 amino acids (molecular weight 13.964 kDa). It is an intrinsic membrane protein and is predicted to cross the membrane several times. Structure and function IFITM proteins have a short N-terminal and C-terminal domain, two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) and a short cytoplasmic domain. The first transmembrane domain (TM1) and the cytoplasmic domain are conserved among different IFITM proteins in human and mouse. In the absence of interferon stimulation, IFITM proteins can express broadly in tissues and cell lines. In human, IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 are able to express in different tissues and cells while the expression of IFITM5 is limited to osteoblasts. The type I and II interferon induce IFITM proteins expression significantly. IFITM proteins are involved in the physiological process of immune response signaling, germ cell maturation and development.  Biochemistry  The gene is induced by interferon and the protein forms part of the signaling pathway.  Antiviral function of IFITM proteins  By using genomic screening for cellular factors which are involved in influenza A virus life cycle such as entry, replication and release, IFITM proteins have been identified as antiviral restriction factors for influenza A virus replication. Knockout IFITM3 increased influenza virus A replication and overexpression IFITM3 inhibits influenza virus A replication. In addition to replication competent influenza A virus, IFITM proteins were able to inhibit retrovirus based pseudotyped influenza A virus, indicating that IFITM protein inhibit influenza A virus at the early step of life cycle, may occur in the entry and fusion steps. IFITM proteins also are able to inhibit several other enveloped viruses infection that belong to different virus families. These virus include flaviviruses (dengue virus and West Nile virus), filoviruses (Marburg virus and Ebola virus) coronaviruses (SARS coronavirus) and lentivirus (Human immunodeficiency virus). However, IFITM proteins did not affect alphaviruses, arenaviruses and murine leukaemia virus infection. Potential mechanisms.IFITM proteins inhibit viral membrane and cellular endosomal or lyso¬¨somal vesicles membrane fusion by modify lipid components or fluidity. IFITM proteins blocked the creation of hemifusion between viral membrane and cellular membrane. Furthermore, IFITM proteins reduced membrane fluidity and affected membrane curvature to restrict viral membrane fusion with the cellular membrane. In addition, IFITM3 interacted with the cellular cholesterol regulatory proteins Vesicle-membrane-protein-associated protein A (VAPA) and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) to induce intracellular cholesterol accumulation, which in turn blocked viral membrane and vesicles membrane fusion.

Timeline Location of Metgethen, showing the K√∂nigsberg defenses and the Soviet attack of 6‚Äì9 April 1945. During the Battle of K√∂nigsberg in 1945, Soviet forces attacking from the north of the Samland peninsula reached the Vistula Lagoon to the west of K√∂nigsberg on January 30, taking Metgethen in the process, a village with a railway station.

THOCs is a member of THO complex which is a subcomplex of the transcription/export complex (TREX). THOC5 is evolutionarily conserved in higher eukaryotes, however the exact roles of THOC5 in transcription and mRNA export are still unclear. THOC5 is phosphorylated by several protein kinases at multiple residues upon extracellular stimuli. These include stimulation with growth factors/cytokines/chemokines, or DNA damage reagents. Furthermore, THOC5 is a substrate for several oncogenic tyrosine kinases, suggesting that THOC5 may be involved in cancer development. Recent THOC5 knockout mouse data reveal that THOC5 is an essential element in the maintenance of stem cells and growth factor/cytokine-mediated differentiation/proliferation. Furthermore, depletion of THOC5 influences less than 1% of total mRNA export in the steady state, however it influences more than 90% of growth factor/cytokine induced genes. THOC5, thereby contributes to the 3‚Ä≤ processing and/or export of immediate-early genes induced by extracellular stimuli.

Personal life Regina de Jes√∫s was born on 16 December 1936 in Concordia, Antioquia to Juan de Dios Betancourt and Ermilia Ram√≠rez, the youngest of 18 children. When she was 17 years old she married Luis Restrepo, a merchant from Antioquia with whom she had four daughters, but who died when she was only 22. On 29 February 1968 she met Daniel Jay Liska Tikalsky, an American adventurer who had travelled by motorcycle from the Arctic Circle in Alaska down to Tierra del Fuego; they married later that year. With Liska she had one daughter, Johanna. She married a third time, this time on 17 October 2004 in Orlando, Florida to an American man she had met online, William Coraline, but the marriage was short lived, divorcing sixteen months later. Career She has published over 20 books on various metaphysical and spiritual subjects, written songs and poetry, and produced videos on her teachings. She has hosted a daily radio talk show, and has worked as a television presenter. She is the founder of the International Centre of Unity, and founder of the political party \\"The Metapolitical Unitarian Movement\\" (Movimiento Unitario Metapolitico). Controversy She was kidnapped for five months, and held in the mountains of Colombia. During her kidnapping she was elected to the city council of Bogot√°. When she was released, she was accused of faking the kidnapping. Her husband Danny Liska died shortly after her release. Shortly after that, The Supreme Court of Justice accused her of fraud and sentenced her to home detention. While under house arrest she wrote Una escoba en el Monte, (A Broom In the Mount), where she related her experiences as a kidnap victim. She was given conditional freedom, but before she could publish her book she was sentenced to jail once again. After she was released from house arrest the Supreme Court of justice found she was innocent and all charges were lifted.

COX4I2 is a nuclear-encoded isoform of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit 4. Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) is a multi-subunit enzyme complex that couples the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and contributes to a proton electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, acting as the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mutations in COX4I2 have been associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, dyserythropoietic anemia, and calvarial hyperostosis (EPIDACH).  Structure  COX4I2 is located on the q arm of chromosome 20 in position 11.21 and has 6 exons. The COX4I2 gene produces a 20 kDa protein composed of 171 amino acids. The protein encoded by COX4I2 belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase IV family. COX4I2 has a transit peptide domain and a disulfide bond amino acid modification. A Glu138 residue, which corresponds to a Glu136 residue in COX4I1, is believed to be highly conserved and structurally important for the mitochondrial COX response to hypoxia.  Function  Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen. It is a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by nuclear genes. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits function in electron transfer, and the nuclear-encoded subunits may be involved in the regulation and assembly of the complex. The COX4I2 nuclear gene encodes isoform 2 of subunit IV. Isoform 1 of subunit IV is encoded by a different gene, however, the two genes show a similar structural organization. Subunit IV is the largest nuclear encoded subunit which plays a pivotal role in COX regulation. It is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane on the matrix side. Expression of COX4I2 is highest in the placenta and the lungs. Additionally, the expression of COX4I2, along with COX4I1, may be regulated by oxygen levels, with reduced levels of oxygen leading to increased COX4I2 expression and COX4I1 degradation. This suggests a role for COX4I2 in the optimization of the electron transfer chain under different conditions.  Clinical Significance  Mutations in COX4I2 have been associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, dyserythropoeitic anemia, and calvarial hyperostosis (EPIDACH). Characteristics of this disease include pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal malabsorption, failure to thrive, and anemia soon after birth. Additional symptoms have included steatorrhea, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, pancreatic atrophy, generalized muscle hypotonia, hyperostosis, yellowish sclera associated with mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia, impaired coagulation functions, elevated LDH, alanine, and bilirubin, and reduced vitamin E levels. A homozygous mutation, E138K, has been found to result in reduced COX4I2 expression (25% in fibroblasts) and an impaired response to hypoxia. Functional COX4I2 expression below 40% of its normal level is predicted to be rate-limiting, with the E138K mutation occurring in what is believed to be a highly conserved residue of subunit IV.  Interactions  COX4I2 has been shown to interact with Cytochrome c (CYCS). Additionally, APP, COA3, and KRAS have been found to have protein-protein interactions with COX4I2.

HAVCR2 was first described in 2002 as a cell surface molecule expressed on IFNŒ≥ producing CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ Tc1 cells. Later, the expression was detected in Th17 cells, regulatory T-cells, and innate immune cells (dendritic cells, NK cells, monocytes).  Structure  HAVCR2 belongs to TIM family cell surface receptor proteins. These proteins share a similar structure, in which the extracellular region consists of membrane distal single variable immunoglobulin domain (IgV) and a glycosylated mucin domain of variable length located closer to the membrane. Intracellular domain of HAVCR2 is called C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. It contains five conserved tyrosine residues that interact with multiple components of T-cell receptor (TCR) complex and negatively regulates its function.  Function  HAVCR2 is an immune checkpoint and together with other inhibitory receptors including programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG3) mediate the CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. HAVCR2 has also been shown as a CD4+ Th1-specific cell surface protein that regulates macrophage activation and enhances the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. HAVCR2 is primarily activated by galectin-9. The engagement leads to stimulation of an influx of calcium to intracellular space and induction of programmed cell death, apoptosis. As a consequence, a suppression of Th1 and Th17 responses and induction of immune tolerance occurs. In addition to galectin-9, a couple other ligands have been identified, such as phospatidyl serine (PtdSer), High Mobility Group Protein 1 (HMGB1) and Carcinoembryonic Antigen Related Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (CEACAM1). The binding of PtdSer has been shown to cause an uptake of apoptotic cells and reduced cross presentation of dying cell-associated antigens by dendritic cells. The binding of HMGB1 can interfere with nucleic acid stimulation and suppresses activation of innate immune response. The role of CEACAM1 engagement is still not clear.  Clinical significance  Immunohistochemical analysis of HAVCR2 in paraffin-embedded human lung carcinoma tissue. HAVCR2 expression is up regulated in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in lung, gastric, head and neck cancer, schwannoma, melanoma and follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The HAVCR2 pathway may interact with the PD-1 pathway in the dysfunctional CD8+ T cells and Tregs in cancer. HAVCR2 is mainly expressed on activated CD8+ T cells and suppresses macrophage activation following PD-1 inhibition. Upregulation was observed in tumors progressing after anti-PD-1 therapy. This seems to be a form of adaptive resistance to immunotherapy. Multiple phase 1/2 clinical trials with anti- HAVCR2 monoclonal antibodies (LY3321367, Eli Lilly and Company; MBG453, Novartis Pharmaceuticals; TSR-022, Tesaro, Inc.) in combination with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapies are ongoing.

According to US Library of Congress subject headings, the \\"Holodomor denial\\" literature includes works that \\"diminish the scale and significance of the Ukrainian famine of 1932-1933 or assert that it did not occur\\" Official Soviet propaganda denied the famine and suppressed information about it from its very beginning until the 1980s. It was also circulated by some Western journalists and intellectuals. It was echoed at the time of the famine by some prominent Western journalists, including The New York Times' Walter Duranty and Louis Fischer. The denial of the famine was a highly successful and well orchestrated disinformation campaign by the Soviet government.Richard Pipes Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime, Vintage books, Random House Inc., New York, 1995, , pages 232-236. According to Robert Conquest, it was the first major instance in which Soviet authorities adopted the Big Lie propaganda technique in order to sway world opinion, and it was followed by similar campaigns with regard to the Moscow Trials and the denial of the existence of the Gulag labor camp system. Only in the post Soviet era, has independent Ukraine officially condemned the Holodomor as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people.

Soviet Union = Cover-up of the famine = The Soviet leadership undertook extensive efforts to prevent the spread of any information about the famine by keeping state communications top secret and taking other measures to prevent word of the famine from spreading. When Ukrainian peasants traveled north to Russia seeking bread, Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov sent a secret telegram to the party and provincial police chiefs with instructions to turn them back,Robert Conquest The Dragons of Expectation. Reality and Delusion in the Course of History, W.W. Norton and Company (2004), , page 102. alleging Polish agents were attempting to create a famine scare. OGPU chairman Genrikh Yagoda subsequently reported that over 200,000 peasants had been turned back. Stanislav Kosior sent a telegram to the politburo assuring that there was no major famine in the Ukrainian SSR. Joseph Stalin began to receive reports of Kosoir's deception and urged the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine to take appropriate measures to prevent a crop failure. An excerpt from the protocol number of the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist party (Bolsheviks) \\"Regarding Measures to Prevent Failure to Sow in Ukraine, March 16th, 1932\\" shows Stalins feared that the severity of the famine had been understated, saying: \\"The Political Bureau believes that shortage of seed grain in Ukraine is many times worse than what was described in comrade Kosior‚Äôs telegram; therefore, the Political Bureau recommends the Central Committee of the Communist party of Ukraine to take all measures within its reach to prevent the threat of failing to sow [field crops] in Ukraine.\\" Signed: Secretary of the Central Committee ‚Äî J. StalinArchive of the President of the Russian Federation. Fond 3, Record Series 40, File 80, Page 58 Soviet head-of-state Mikhail Kalinin responded to Western offers of food by telling of \\"political cheats who offer to help the starving Ukraine,\\" and commented, \\"Only the most decadent classes are capable of producing such cynical elements.\\" In an interview with Gareth Jones in March 1933, Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov stated, \\"Well, there is no famine\\", and went on to say, \\"You must take a longer view. The present hunger is temporary. In writing books you must have a longer view. It would be difficult to describe it as hunger.\\" On instructions from Litvinov, Boris Skvirsky, embassy counselor of the recently opened Soviet Embassy in the United States, published a letter on 3 January 1934, in response to a pamphlet about the famine. In his letter, Skvirsky stated that the idea that the Soviet government was \\"deliberately killing the population of the Ukraine\\" \\"wholly grotesque.\\" He claimed that the Ukrainian population had been increasing at an annual rate of 2 percent during the preceding five years and asserted that the death rate in Ukraine \\"was the lowest of that of any of the constituent republics composing the Soviet Union\\", concluding that it \\"was about 35 percent lower than the pre-war death rate of tsarist days.\\"New York Times, as quoted in James E. Mace, \\"Collaboration in the suppression of the Ukrainian famine\\" (paper delivered at a conference on \\"Recognition and Denial of Genocide and Mass Killing in the 20th Century\\", held in New York City on 13 November 1987), The Ukrainian Weekly, 10 January 1988, No. 2, Vol. LVI Mention of the famine was criminalized, punishable with a five-year term in the Gulag labor camps. Blaming the authorities was punishable by death.Robert Conquest Reflections on a Ravaged Century (2000) , p. 96 William Henry Chamberlin was a Moscow correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor for 10 years; in 1934 he was reassigned to the Far East. After he left the Soviet Union he wrote his account of the situation in Ukraine and North Caucasus (Poltava, Bila Tserkva, and Kropotkin). Chamberlin later published a couple of books: Russia's Iron Age and The Ukraine: A Submerged Nation. He wrote in the Christian Science Monitor in 1934 that \\"the evidence of a large-scale famine was so overwhelming, was so unanimously confirmed by the peasants that the most 'hard-boiled' local officials could say nothing in denial\\". = Falsification and suppression of evidence = The true number of dead was concealed. At the Kiev Medical Inspectorate, for example, the actual number of corpses, 9,472, was recorded as only 3,997. The GPU was directly involved in the deliberate destruction of actual birth and death records, as well as the fabrication of false information to cover up information regarding the causes and scale of death in Ukraine.Boriak, Hennadii (Fall 2001). \\"The publication of sources on the history of the 1932-1933 famine-genocide: history, current state, and prospects\\". Harvard Ukrainian Studies 25 (3-4): 167‚Äì186. Similar falsifications of official records were widespread. The January 1937 census, the first in 11 years, was intended to reflect the achievements of Stalin's rule. It became evident that population growth particularly in Ukraine failed to meet official targets‚Äîevidence of the mortality resulting from the famine and from associated indirect demographic losses. Those collecting the data, senior statisticians with decades of experience, were arrested and executed, including three successive heads of the Soviet Central Statistical Administration. The census data itself was locked away for half a century in the Russian State Archive of the Economy.Lisa Shymko, \\"The Politics of Genocide\\", The American Spectator, 14 November 2007Catherine Merridale, \\"The 1937 Census and the Limits of Stalinist Rule\\" _Historical Journal_ 39, 1996 The subsequent 1939 census was organized in a manner that certainly inflated data on population numbers. It showed a population figure of 170.6 million people, manipulated so as to match the numbers stated by Joseph Stalin in his report to the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party that March. No other census in the Soviet Union was conducted until 1959. =Soviet campaign in the 1980s= The Soviet Union denied the existence of the famine until its 50th anniversary, in 1983, when the worldwide Ukrainian community coordinated famine remembrance. The Ukrainian diaspora exerted significant pressure on the media and various governments, including the United States and Canada, to raise the issue of the famine with the government of the Soviet Union. While the Soviet government admitted that some peasantry died, it also sought to launch a disinformation campaign, in February 1983, to blame drought. The head of the directorate for relations with foreign countries for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), A. Merkulov, charged Leonid Kravchuk, the chief ideologue for the Communist Party in Ukraine, with finding rainfall evidence for the Great famine. This new evidence was to be sent to the Novosti press centers in the U.S. and Canada, denouncing the \\"antidemocratic base of the Ukrainian bourgeois Nationalists, the collaboration of the Banderists and the Hitlerite Fascists during the Second World War.\\"–¶–ì–ê–û–û–£. –§.1. –û–ø. 25 –î. 2719. –õ.27-28. –ü–æ–¥–ª–∏–Ω–Ω–∏–∫.

In February 1983, Alexander Yakovlev, the Soviet Ambassador to Canada, in a secret analysis \\"Some thoughts regarding the advertising of the Ukrainian SSR Pavilion held at the International Exposition \\"Man and the world\\" held in Canada\\" put forward a prognosis for a campaign being prepared to bring international attention to the Ukrainian Holodomor which was spearheaded by the Ukrainian nationalist community. Yakovlev proposed a list of concrete proposals to \\"neutralise the enemy ideological actions of the Ukrainian bourgeoise nationalists\\". By April 1983, the bureau of the Soviet Novosti Press Agency had prepared and sent out a special press release denying the occurrence of the 1933 famine in Ukraine. This press release was sent to every major newspaper, radio and television station as well as University in Canada. It was also sent out to all members of the Canadian parliament.–°–µ—Ä–≥—ñ–π—á—É–∫ –í. –Ø–∫ –Ω–∞—Å –º–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∏ –ì–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º 1932-1933 - –ö–∏—ó–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π –ù–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –£–Ω—ñ–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç, –ö–∏—ó–≤, 2006 —Å.323 (In Ukrainian) Serhiychuk, V.

How we were tired by Famine 1932-33 - Kiev University, Kiev, 2006 page 324 Former Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk recalled that he was responsible for countering the Ukrainian Diaspora's public education campaign of the 1980s, marking 50 years of the Soviet terror famine in 1983: \\" In the early 1980s many publications began appearing in the Western press on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of one of the most horrific tragedies in the history of our people. A counter-propaganda machine was put into motion, and I was one of its wheels.\\" The first book on the famine was published in Ukraine only in 1989, after a major shake-up that occurred in the Communist Party of Ukraine when Volodymyr Ivashko replaced Volodymyr Shcherbytsky and the Political Bureau decided that such book could be published. However, even in this book, \\"the most terrifying photographs were not approved for print, and their number was reduced from 1,500 to around 350.\\"Kravchuk, Leonid Mayemo te, shcho mayemo: spohady i rozdumy, Kiev, 2002, Stolittya (392 p.) , pp. 44-46, The United States Congress created the Commission on the Ukraine Famine in 1986. Soviet authorities were correct in their expectation that the commission would lay responsibility for the famine on the Soviet state. Ultimately, as President of Ukraine, Kravchuk exposed the official cover-up attempts and came out in support of recognizing the famine, named the \\"Holodomor\\", as genocide. Denial outside the USSR =Walter Duranty= According to Patrick Wright, Robert C. Tucker, Eugene Lyons, Mona Charen and Thomas Woods one of the first Western Holodomor deniers was Walter Duranty, the winner of the 1932 Pulitzer prize in journalism in the category of correspondence, for his dispatches on Soviet Union and the working out of the Five Year Plan.\\"Correspondence between Markian Pelech and the Board of the Pulitzer Prizes regarding Walter Duranty's 1932 Pulitzer Prize\\" (30 December 2002 ‚Äì 28 April 2003) While the famine was raging, he wrote in the pages of The New York Times that \\"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\\", and that \\"there is no actual starvation or deaths from starvation, but there is widespread mortality from diseases due to malnutrition.\\" Duranty was well aware of the famine. He said in private to Eugene Lyons and reported to the British Embassy that the population of Ukraine and Lower Volga had \\"decreased\\" by six to seven million.Embassy dispatch dated 30 September 1933 included the following: \\"According to Mr. Duranty the population of North Caucasus and the Lower Volga had decreased in the past year by three million, and the population of Ukraine by four to five million\\" (cited from \\"Reflections on the ravaged century\\", p. 123) However, in his reports, Duranty downplayed the impact of food shortages in Ukraine. As Duranty wrote in a dispatch from Moscow in March 1933, \\"Conditions are bad, but there is no famine... But‚Äîto put it brutally‚Äîyou can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.\\" Duranty also wrote denunciations of those who wrote about the famine, accusing them of being reactionaries and anti-Bolshevik propagandists. In August 1933, Cardinal Theodor Innitzer of Vienna called for relief efforts, stating that the Ukrainian famine was claiming lives \\"likely... numbered... by the millions\\" and driving those still alive to infanticide and cannibalism. The New York Times, 20 August 1933, reported Innitzer's charge and published an official Soviet denial: \\"in the Soviet Union we have neither cannibals nor cardinals\\". The next day, the Times added Duranty's own denial. British journalist Malcolm Muggeridge (who went hopefully to live in the New Civilization in 1932, but soon became disillusioned) said of Duranty that he \\"always enjoyed his company; there was something vigorous, vivacious, preposterous, about his unscrupulousness which made his persistent lying somehow absorbing.\\"Muggeridge, Malcolm: The Green Stick: Chronicles of Wasted Time Volume I Chapter 5 (1972). Muggeridge characterised Duranty as \\"the greatest liar of any journalist I have met in 50 years of journalism.\\"Robert Conquest. The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine Oxford University Press (1987), , page 320. Others have characterized Duranty as \\"the number one Useful Idiot for Lenin first, and later for Stalin.\\"Mark Y. Herring, \\"Useful Idiot\\" (a review of Stalin's apologist: Walter Duranty, the New York Times man in Moscow, by S.J. Taylor), Contra Mundum, nr. 15, 1995 An international campaign for the retraction of Duranty's Pulitzer Prize was launched in 2003 by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association and its supporters. The newspaper, however, declined to relinquish it, arguing that Duranty received the prize for a series of reports about the Soviet Union, eleven of which were published in June 1931. In 1990, the Times admitted that his was \\"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\\" Some historians consider Duranty's reports from Moscow to be crucial in the decision taken by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to grant the Soviet Union diplomatic recognition in 1933.John Berlau, \\"Duranty's Deception\\" , Insight, 22 July 2003 Bolshevik Karl Radek said that was indeed the case. = By prominent visitors to the USSR = Prominent writers from Ireland and Britain who visited the Soviet Union in 1934, such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, are also on record as denying the existence of the famine in Ukraine.Edvard Radzinsky Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives, Anchor, (1997) , pages 256-259. According to Radzinsky, Stalin \\"had achieved the impossible: he had silenced all the talk of hunger... Millions were dying, but the nation hymned the praises of collectivization\\". In 1934 the British Foreign Office in the House of Lords stated that there was no evidence to support the allegations against the Soviet government regarding the famine in Ukraine, based on the testimony of Sir John Maynard, a renowned famine expert who visited Ukraine in the summer of 1933 and rejected \\"tales of famine-genocide propagated by the Ukrainian Nationalists\\". The height of denial was reached during a visit to Ukraine carried out between 26 August ‚Äì 9 September 1933, by French Prime Minister √âdouard Herriot, who denied accounts of the famine and said that Soviet Ukraine was \\"like a garden in full bloom\\".Nicolas Werth, Karel Barto≈°ek, Jean-Louis Pann√©, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, St√©phane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, , pages 159-160 The day before his arrival, all beggars, homeless children and starving people were removed from the streets. Shop windows in local stores were filled with food, but purchases were forbidden, and anyone coming too close to the stores was arrested. The streets were washed. Just like all other Western visitors, Herriot met fake \\"peasants\\", all selected Communists or Komsomol members, who showed him healthy cattle.Reflections, p. 122 Herriot declared to the press that there was no famine in Ukraine, that he did not see any trace of it, and that this showed adversaries of the Soviet Union were spreading the rumour. \\"When one believes that the Ukraine is devastated by famine, allow me to shrug my shoulders\\", he declared. The 13 September 1933 issue of Pravda was able to write that Herriot \\"categorically contradicted the lies of the bourgeoisie press in connection with a famine in the USSR.\\" The lack of knowledge of the famine was observed by English writer George Orwell, who commented that \\"huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English Russophiles\\".George Orwell, \\"Notes on Nationalism\\" in The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell (London, 1968), Vol. 3, p. 370. In 1945, Orwell wrote, \\"[I]t was considered equally proper to publicise famines when they happened in India and to conceal them when they happened in the Ukraine. And if this was true before the war, the intellectual atmosphere is certainly no better now.\\" Nigel Colley has written on the influence of the Ukrainian famine, and the Holodomor denial of Duranty, on Orwell's book Animal Farm. =Douglas Tottle= In the 1980s, the Soviet Communist Party approached the Canadian Communist Party to engage journalist Douglas Tottle to prepare counter-propaganda materials under the title \\"Fraud, Famine and Ukrainian Fascism\\". Before final publication, the official reviewers of the tome in Kiev suggested that the name of the book be changed, as stated in their explanation \\"Ukrainian fascism never existed\\".In his book, Searching for place, Lubomyr Luciuk commented: \\"For a particularly base example of famine-denial literature, see Tottle, Fraud, famine, and fascism...\\", see Lubomyr Luciuk, Searching for place: Ukrainian displaced persons, Canada, and the migration of memory, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000, p. 413. In 1987, Tottle published his controversial book as Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard, in which he asserts that claims the Holodomor was an intentional genocide are \\"fraudulent\\", and \\"a creation of Nazi propagandists\\". His book, published by Progress Publishers in Toronto, appeared around the same time Ukrainian Communist party leader Volodymyr Shcherbytsky publicly acknowledged the famine, in December 1987. As a result, the book was subsequently withdrawn from circulation. In a review of Tottle's book in the Ukrainian Canadian Magazine, published by the pro-Communist Association of United Ukrainian Canadians, Wilfred Szczesny wrote: \\"Members of the general public who want to know about the famine, its extent and causes, and about the motives and techniques of those who would make this tragedy into something other than what it was will find Tottle's work invaluable\\" (The Ukrainian Canadian, April 1988, p. 24), on which historian Roman Serbyn commented that \\"in the era of glasnost, Szczesny could have rendered his readers no greater disservice\\". Some of Tottle's material appeared in a 1988 article in the Village Voice, \\"In Search of a Soviet Holocaust: A 55-Year-Old Famine Feeds the Right\\". In 1988, the International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932‚Äì33 Famine in Ukraine was set up to establish whether the famine existed and its cause. Tottle was invited by the commission to attend the hearings, but he ignored the request. While the commission was organized along judicial lines, it had no judicial power to compel witnesses to attend or testify. However, Tottle's book was examined during the Brussels sitting of the commission, held between 23‚Äì27 May 1988, with testimony from various expert witnesses. The commission president Professor Jacob Sundberg subsequently concluded that Tottle was not alone in his enterprise to deny the famine on the basis that material included in his book could not have been available to a private person without official Soviet assistance.A.J.Hobbins, Daniel Boyer, Seeking Historical Truth: the International Commission of Inquiry into the 1932-33 Famine in the Ukraine, Dalhousie Law Journal, 2001, Vol 24, page 166 Modern politics =Background= The issue of the Holodomor has been a point of contention between Russia and Ukraine, as well as within Ukrainian politics. According to opinion polls, Russia has experienced an increase in pro-Stalin sentiments since the year 2000, with over half viewing Stalin favourably in 2015. Since independence, Ukrainian governments have passed a number of laws dealing with the Holodomor and the Soviet past, with the latest being the \\"Decommunization laws\\" of 2015. The Russian government does not recognize the famine as an act of genocide against Ukrainians, viewing it rather as a \\"tragedy\\" that affected the Soviet Union as a whole. A 2008 letter from Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko asserted that the famine \\"was not targeted at extermination of any single nation\\", and accused Ukraine of exploiting it for political ends. In November 2010 a leaked confidential U.S. diplomatic cable revealed that Russia had allegedly pressured its neighbors not to support the designation of the Holodomor as a genocide at the United Nations. According to another leaked document, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described Israel's recognition of the Holodomor as \\"historical revisionism\\". =Denial literature= In 2006, the All-Ukrainian Public Association \\"Intelligentsia of Ukraine for Socialism\\" published a pamphlet titled \\"The Myth of the Holodomor\\" by G. S. Tkachenko. The pamphlet claimed that Ukrainian Nationalists and the US government were responsible for creating the \\"myth.\\" Russian publicist Yuri Mukhin has a published a book titled \\"Hysterical Women of the Holodomor\\", dismissing Holodomor as \\"Russophobia\\" and \\"a trump card of the Ukrainian Nazis.\\" Sigizmund Mironin's \\"Holodomor in the Rus\\" argued that the cause of the famine was not Stalin's policies, but rather the chaos engendered by the New Economic Policy. Russian state media ran several articles denying the severity and causes of the Ukrainian famine. =Ukrainian law= On 28 November 2006, Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, passed a law recognizing the 1932-1933 Holodomor as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. The voting figures were as follows: supporting the bill were BYuT‚Äî118 deputies, NSNU‚Äî79 deputies, Socialists‚Äî30 deputies, 4 independent deputies, and the Party of Regions‚Äî2 deputies (200 deputies did not cast a vote). The Communist Party of Ukraine voted against the bill. In all, 233 deputies supported the bill‚Äîmore than the minimum of 226 votes required to pass it into law.\\"Holodomor and Holocaust denial to be a criminal offense\\", 3 April 2007\\"What the Verkhovna Rada actually passed\\", 28 February 2007 A draft law \\"On Amendments to the Criminal and the Procedural Criminal Codes of Ukraine\\" was submitted by President Viktor Yushchenko for consideration by the Ukrainian Parliament. The draft law envisaged prosecution for public denial of the Holodomor Famine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine as a fact of genocide of the Ukrainian people, and of the Holocaust as the fact of genocide of the Jewish people. The draft law foresaw that public denial as well as production and dissemination of materials denying the above shall be punished by a fine of 100 to 300 untaxed minimum salaries, or imprisonment of up to two years. The draft law, however, failed to receive support from incoming President Viktor Yanukovych, who, following his inauguration in 2010, declared: \\"it would be wrong and unfair to recognize the Holodomor as an act of genocide against one nation\\"--this among a number of actions seen as his pursuing a more Russocentric policy. However, in 2011 he stated: \\"Terrible years of totalitarianism have been a spiritual catastrophe: numerous churches were demolished, hundreds of thousands of peasants, workers, and intellectuals were physically eliminated or sent to the Gulag camps, almost every Ukrainian family suffered,\\" and in 2012 affirmed: \\"This crime has changed the history of Ukrainian people forever. It has been one of the severest challenges of Ukrainians. Holodomor not only killed people, but also had the purpose of causing fear and obedience.\\" See also *Holodomor genocide question *Grover Furr  References   Further reading  *Andreopoulos, George J., Ed.

(Photographer unknown) William Shakespeare's Hamlet is a tragedy, believed to have been written between 1599 and 1601. It tells the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark‚Äîwho takes revenge on the current king (Hamlet's uncle) for killing the previous king (Hamlet's father) and for marrying his father's widow (Hamlet's mother)‚Äîand it charts the course of his real or feigned madness. Hamlet is the longest play‚Äîand Hamlet is the largest part‚Äîin the entire Shakespeare canon.Thompson & Taylor (2006a, 25). Critics say that Hamlet \\"offers the greatest exhibition of Shakespeare's powers\\".Kermode (2000, 96.) Academic Laurie Osborne identifies the direct influence of Hamlet in numerous modern narratives, and divides them into four main categories: fictional accounts of the play's composition, simplifications of the story for young readers, stories expanding the role of one or more characters, and narratives featuring performances of the play.Osborne (2007, 114-133 especially 115 & 120) Novels and plays :See also Hamlet in popular culture Hamlet is one of the most-quoted works in the English language, and often included on lists of the world's greatest literature.Hamlet has 208 quotations in the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations; it takes up 10 of 85 pages dedicated to Shakespeare in the 1986 Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (14th ed. 1968). For examples of lists of the greatest books, see Harvard Classics, Great Books, Great Books of the Western World, Harold Bloom's The Western Canon, St. John's College reading list, and Columbia College Core Curriculum. As such, it has proved a pervasive influence in literature. For instance, Henry Fielding's Tom Jones, published about 1749, merely describes a visit to Hamlet by Tom Jones and Mr Partridge.Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 123‚Äì126). In contrast, Goethe's Bildungsroman Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, written between 1776‚Äì1796 not only has a production of Hamlet at its core but also dwells on parallels between the Ghost and Wilhelm Meister's dead father. In the early 1850s, in Pierre, Herman Melville focuses on a Hamlet-like character's long development as a writer. Ten years later, Dickens' Great Expectations contains many Hamlet-like plot elements: it is driven by revenge actions, contains ghost- like characters (Abel Magwitch and Miss Havisham), and focuses on the hero's guilt. Academic Alexander Welsh notes that Great Expectations is an \\"autobiographical novel\\" and \\"anticipates psychoanalytic readings of Hamlet itself\\".Welsh (2001, 131) About the same time, George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss was published, introducing Maggie Tulliver \\"who is explicitly compared with Hamlet\\".Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 126‚Äì132). Scholar Marianne Novy suggests that Eliot \\"demythologises Hamlet by imagining him with a reputation for sanity\\", notwithstanding his frequent monologues and moodiness towards Ophelia.Novy (1994, 62, 77-78) Novy also suggests Mary Wollstonecraft as an influence on Eliot, critiquing \\"the trivialisation of women in contemporary society\\". Hamlet has played \\"a relatively small role\\" in the appropriation of Shakespeare's plays by women writers, ranging from Ophelia, The Fair Rose of Elsinore in Mary Cowden Clarke's 1852 The Girlhood of Shakespeare's Heroines, to Margaret Atwood's 1994 Gertrude Talks Back‚Äîin her 1994 collection of short stories Good Bones and Simple Murders‚Äîin which the title character sets her son straight about Old Hamlet's murder: \\"It wasn't Claudius, darling, it was me!\\"\\"Gertrude Talks Back\\" by Margaret Attwood Also, because of the criticism of the sexism, American author Lisa Klein wrote Ophelia, a novel that portrays Ophelia, too, as feigning madness and surviving. Author Molly Booth has written a young adult historical fiction novel, \\"Saving Hamlet\\", about a teenage girl who time travels back to the original production of Hamlet at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London, 1601. The book has a focus on Ophelia's role, and how the sexism from Shakespeare's era translates to sexism in modern society for young women. \\"Saving Hamlet\\" was published by Disney Hyperion on November 1st, 2016. Also in 2016, Ian McEwan's novel Nutshell was published, which retells Hamlet from the point of view of an unborn child.

Function  PRC1 protein is expressed at relatively high levels during S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle before dropping dramatically after mitotic exit and entrance into G1 phase. PRC1 is located in the nucleus during interphase, becomes associated with the mitotic spindle in a highly dynamic manner during anaphase, and localizes to the cell midbody during cytokinesis. PRC1 was first identified in 1998 using an in vitro phosphorylation screening method and shown to be a substrate of several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Correspondingly, ablation of PRC1 has been shown to disrupt spindle midzone assembly in mammalian systems. At least three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms of PRC1 have been observed. Additionally, PRC1 has sequence homology with Ase1 in yeasts, SPD-1 (spindle defective 1) in C. elegans, Feo in D. melanogaster, and MAP65 in plants, all of which fall in a conserved family of nonmotor microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Structure The crystal structure of PRC1 has only recently been characterized in vitro. In 2013, PRC1 was illustrated as a lengthy molecule consisting of a C-terminal spectrin microtubule-binding domain, an extended rod domain, and an N-terminal dimerization domain. Consisting of an intricate arrangement of Œ±-helices, the rod domain, together with the dimerization- conducting N terminus cooperate to facilitate binding of other proteins, such as Kinesin-4, to PRC1. PRC1‚Äôs rod domain adopts multiple conformations, all affected by its C-terminal spectrin domain. A model has been suggested in which PRC1 is likely to be a flexible molecule both in solution and on single microtubules but becomes more rigid when the microtubule-binding domains are restricted with antiparallel microtubule filament crosslinking, seen at the spindle midzone. The overall structure of the PRC1 homodimer is reminiscent of actin-bundling proteins, and this process of microtubule filament crosslinking is similar to that of actin.  Role in cytokinesis  PRC1‚Äôs role in midzone microtubule formation, essential to the cytokinetic machinery of mammals, is made possible through its collaboration with Kinesin-4 in setting up a controlled zone of overlapping, antiparallel microtubules at the spindle midzone. PRC1 is normally inhibited until anaphase onset by CDK1 mediated phosphorylation, preventing its dimerization. Upon anaphase onset and removal of inhibitory CDK1 phosphorylation, PRC1 dimers form. These homodimers specifically recognize antiparallel microtubule overlaps, found at the spindle midzone, and bind, allowing microtubule sliding, cross-linking of microtubule filaments, and assembly of central-spindle-mediating proteins, including but not limited to Kinesin-4. PRC1 dimers, required for the high-affinity interaction with Kinesin-4, recruit Kinesin-4 to regions of antiparallel microtubule overlap, where Kinesin-4, a plus-end directed motor protein that inhibits microtubule dynamics, helps to form length-dependent end tags that help stabilize and regulate spindle microtubule assembly within cytokinesis. This PRC1-Kinesin-4 complex differentially identifies and regulates the spindle midzone microtubules during cell division. This regulation is crucial in order for cytokinesis to progress properly.  Interactions  * PRC1 is a non-motor microtubule-associated protein (MAP) whose C-terminal spectrin domain (aa 341-640) binds microtubules with micromolar affinity (0.6 +/- 0.3uM) * PRC1 has been shown to interact with TRIM37. * PRC1 interacts with Kinesin-4 that plays an important role in crossing spindle microtubules and setting midzone length in mammalian cytokinesis. * PRC1 is negatively modulated by CDKs, particularly CDK1. * PLK1 negatively regulates PRC1 through phosphorylation at Thr-602, near the C-terminus of PRC1, only after dephosphorylation of PRC1 at an inhibitory CDK1 site. * PRC1 binds directly to CYK-4 subunit of the centralspindlin complex to stabilise the central spindle.

The glycine transporter 2 is a membrane protein which recaptures glycine, a major inhibitory transmitter in the spinal cord and brainstem. GlyT2 is a specific marker of glycinergic neurons and a member of the Na+ and Cl‚àí-coupled transporter family SLC6. Glycine uptake mediated by GlyT2 is electrogenic, coupled to three Na+ and one Cl‚àí (i.e. two positive charges per glycine). In humans, GlyT2 is encoded by the SLC6A5 gene. Inactivation of GlyT2 in knockout mice is lethal during the second post-natal week as the absence of GlyT2 disrupts inhibitory transmission by reducing glycine release. Mutations in SLC6A5 gene are responsible for a presynaptic form of hyperekplexia, a genetic disease causing increased startle reflex. GlyT2 main physiological role is to recapture glycine released in the synaptic cleft and to maintain high glycine concentration in the presynaptic neuron.

Together with VAPB and VAPC it forms the VAP protein family. They are integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins of the type II and are ubiquitous among eukaryotes. VAPA is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is thought to be involved in membrane trafficking by interaction with SNAREs. in regulation of lipid transport and metabolism, and in the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Protein structure The protein is divided in three different domains. First, an N-terminal beta-sheet with an immunoglobulin-like fold that shares homology with the Nematode major sperm protein (MSP). Secondly, a central coiled-coil domain. Then finally a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) which is usually present in proteins of the t-SNARE superfamily and has been found in other proteins associated with vesicular transport. VAPA can form homo-dimers and also hetero dimers with VAPB by interactions through their (TMD). Intracellular Localisation Because of its ubiquitous expression, the intracellular localisation and function of VAPA may vary between cell types. It is however mainly located in the ER, Golgi apparatus and the Vesicular Tubular Compartment or ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment, an organelle of eukaryotic cells consisting in fused ER-derived vesicles that transports proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.  Interactions  VAPA has been documented to interact with three different groups of proteins: proteins associated with vesicle traffic and fusion, proteins containing the FFAT motif and viral proteins. =Vesicle traffic and fusion= VAPA is able to bind a range of SNARE proteins including syntaxin1A, rbet1 and rsec22. It also binds to proteins associated with membrane fusion machinery such as alphaSNAP and NSF.These interaction suggest that VAPA could have a general role in the regulation of the function of these proteins that are mainly involved in membrane fusion =Viral Proteins= VAP proteins have been found to be essential host factors for several viruses. VAP proteins binds with non-structural proteins of the hepatitis C virus NS5A and NS5B allowing the RNA replication machinery of the virus to set up on the lipid raft membrane of the host cell. VAPA also binds to several viral proteins from the Norovirus family and is important for the virus replication efficiency. The non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2 are able to bind VAPA thanks to sequence mimicry of the FFAT motif probably yielding the same advantage to viral replication as for hepatitis C virus. =FFAT motif= The N-terminal MSP-homologous part of VAPA is able to bind to the FFAT motif, a particular sequence motif shared by several lipid binding proteins including oxysterol- binding protein (OSBP).  Function  One of its proposed functions is to slow down the lipid flow back towards the ER when protein misfolding occurs, in order to reduce the amount of stress triggered by the UPR. The VAP would regulate this process by inhibiting membrane contact. Associated Diseases The P56S SNP in the MSP domain of VAPB is involved in the onset of Lou Gehrig's disease also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) where the patient loses muscle control and function.

Function  CPI-17 is a phosphorylation-dependent inhibitor protein of smooth muscle myosin phosphatase, discovered in pig aortic homogenetes. Phosphorylation of the Thr-38 residue converts the protein into a potent inhibitor for myosin phosphatase. A single phosphorylation of CPI-17 at Thr-38 triggers a global conformational change that causes re-alignment of four helices. Multiple kinases are identified to phosphorylate CPI-17, such as PKC, ROCK, PKN, ZIPK, ILK, and PAK. Agonist stimulation of smooth muscle enhances CPI-17 phosphorylation mainly through PKC and ROCK. Myosin phosphatase inhibition increases myosin phosphorylation and smooth muscle contraction in the absence of increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This phenomenon is known as Ca2+ sensitization, which occurs in response to agonist stimulation of smooth muscle. In Purkinje neuron, CPI-17 is involved in long-term synaptic depression. There are three homologues of CPI-17: * Phosphatase Holoenzyme Inhibitor (PHI: PPP1R14B), * Kinase Enhanced Phosphatase Inhibitor (KEPI: PPP1R14C), and * Gastric-Brain Phosphatase Inhibitor (GBPI: PPP1R14D).
