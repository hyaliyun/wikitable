Briat was 21 years old at the time. A local Green leader highlighted the wider significance of the incident as an illustration of the protestors' security and safety concerns relating to the transport: \\"A train could hit something at any moment, and there's nothing that the SNCF nor the organisations which are meant to provide security can do about it.\\"Texte de ses compagnons de route, Rebellyon According to The New York Times, Briat was \\"surprised by the train.\\" The train was carrying 12 containers of waste from German nuclear power plants, which had been reprocessed in France, and was heading to Gorleben, Germany for storage. Briat was one of at least 4,500 people who attended the protest, which the New York Times said was \\"prompted by concerns about the safety of the nuclear material.\\" Train Kills French Nuclear Protester, The New York Times, November 8, 2004. The train's conductor hit the brakes as soon as he saw Briat, but because of momentum, was not able to stop the train in time to prevent it from hitting him. Briat's leg was severed by the train. As he did not die immediately, paramedics started to take him to the hospital, but he died before reaching the hospital. Germany has an agreement with France which allows Germany to send its nuclear waste to France for reprocessing, as long as Germany takes it back afterward for storage. Protester dies under atomic train, BBC, November 7, 2004 Afterward, it was reported that Briat had violated a number of key safety rules that protesters normally followed. It was reported among others that \\"Briat had chained himself shortly after a curve in the track, behind a hill, near a forest, which made it impossible for the conductor to see him in time to stop. In addition, Briat did not wait for the train to stop before chaining himself to the track. Finally, Briat did not have other protesters stationed further down the tracks to alert the conductor with smoke signals. More experienced protesters normally take safety precautions to avoid these mistakes. Fatality fuels anti-nuclear protest, The Guardian, November 10, 2004\\".

Its right-of way formed the main line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad west from Pittsburgh. It was reorganized in 1889 under Malcolm A. McDonald. The railroad constructed another narrow gauge line from Callery Junction to Foxburg, Pennsylvania. This line would later become known as the Northern Subdivision of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;). In 1883 the railroad took control of the line from Foxburg to Mount Jewett after the Pittsburgh, Bradford and Buffalo Railroad had financially flopped. The railroad would later merge with the Bradford, Bordell and Kinzua Railroad, and the Big Level and Kinzua Railroad. These mergers would prove to be ineffective; by 1902 these joint railways were in financial ruin. The Bradford, Bordell and Kinzua Railroad handled significant interchange traffic with standard gauge lines by use of truck exchange. Cars were hoisted at interchange points and trucks were rolled out and replaced with new ones of the appropriate gauge. On at least one occasion, the blocking used to adapt a standard-gauge car to narrow gauge trucks failed, leading to a fatal accident.Titus v. Bradford, Bordell & Kinzua Railroad Company, Lancaster Law Review, Vol. VIII No. 12 (Feb. 16, 1891); pages 93-95. In 1902, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) took control of the P&W.; By 1911, the P&W; was dissolved, and the B&O; took over all operations. That same year, most of the narrow gauge was converted to track. The B&O; would continue to operate the line until 1982 when it was acquired by Sloan Cornell of the Knox and Kane Railroad. Trackage between Ribold and Butler, Pennsylvania, as well as the Petrolia Branch is used by the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad. The Clarion Junction-Kane section ceased operations in 2006; it was abandoned in 2008 when the Knox and Kane Railroad was sold at auction.

He was accounted one of the foremost tonmeisters in the world by many contemporary musicians including Mstislav Rostropovich, Gerald Moore and Herbert von Karajan. He is widely acknowledged as a key figure in classical music recording from the 1960s up to his retirement in 1985.Obituary, Suvi Raj Grubb Persuasive guiding light in the classical recording studio. The Guardian, 27 Jan 2000 Among his achievements was the discovery and promotion of the young Daniel Barenboim. He recorded many of the great classical musicians of the day including Otto Klemperer, Carlo Maria Giulini, Dame Janet Baker, André Previn (with whom he was nominated for the Grammy award for best orchestral recording in 1979) and Itzhak Perlman. He was responsible for the legendary 1953 recording of the Mozart horn concerti by Dennis Brain and the Philharmonia Orchestra under Herbert von Karajan,Towards a musicology of early-mid 1960s recordings, prof. Andrew Blake, University of Winchester, 2005 still reckoned to be the reference by which all recordings of the Mozart concerti are judged. Grubb's knowledge of Western music was founded on his early experiences of Christian hymns in his youth in India, where he was an organist and choirmaster alongside his career which saw him studying a BSc at Madras University and working in a technical capacity for All India Radio. He emigrated to England with his wife, a doctor, in 1953, working freelance for the BBC, and in his spare time joined the Philharmonia Chorus. Through the Philharmonia he met Legge, who was the founder of the Philharmonia Orchestra, and was recruited to EMI after an exacting interview at which he demonstrated detailed knowledge of the Western classical repertoire.Moore, Gerald: Farewell Recital His influence was such that in just three months he managed to arrange, book, record and release a record to celebrate the 70th birthday of accompanist Gerald Moore, including Yehudi Menuhin, Jacqueline du Pré, Daniel Barenboim, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Victoria de los Ángeles, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Léon Goossens, Gervase de Peyer, and Nicolai Gedda. At one point these artists were queuing in the waiting room at EMI's studios for their allotted slots with Moore at the piano. His close personal friendship with Barenboim led to the creation of a remarkable and poignant recording: in 1971, Jacqueline du Pré, Barenboim's wife, had already been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and had not played for a year. On one day she pronounced that she was feeling somewhat fitter, and Barenboim telephoned Grubb who used his position in EMI to secure an empty studio at Abbey Road where, over two days, he recorded Barenboim and du Pré in Frédéric Chopin's Cello Sonata in G minor and César Franck's Violin Sonata in A arranged as a cello sonata. This was du Pré's last recording.Jacqualine du Pré, Elizaneth Wilson This period, from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, saw a change in the type of person entering the recording industry; technicians who were also appreciators of music were replaced with music graduates who were educated on the technical aspects. Grubb, as one of the old school, was an advocate of the naturalistic style of recording, where the aim was to faithfully reproduce the sound of a concert hall. Grubb was distinctly cool towards modernist music, and was a firm traditionalist. He counted Ralph Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten among his friends, but both these composers' styles had their roots in 19th Century classicism. He did, though, produce a number of important first recordings, including Dmitri Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk and Manuel de Falla's Atlántida. He also produced recordings of works by Béla Bartók and a 1967 recording of Ferruccio Busoni's Piano Concerto played by John Ogdon; it appears that he was influenced in these choices by his friendship with and trust towards the many exceptional musicians with whom he worked. Grubb retired in 1985, living first in Spain and returning to India in 1992. He died in Pune in 1999. There are many accounts of Grubb's involvement in the music industry in the memoirs of performers of the time, notably Sir John Barbirolli, André Previn, Daniel Barenboim and Gerald Moore, and Grubb also wrote a memoir entitled Music Makers on Record, for which Barenboim wrote an introduction.

OR&A; also includes an assurance component which gives an ongoing, real-time indication of the likelihood that the project will achieve that state by the time of handover to the eventual owner/operator. Operations Readiness Operations readiness is the process of preparing the custodians of an asset under construction, and their supporting organisation, to be fully ready to assume ownership of the asset at the point of delivery/handover, and to be able to take responsibility for performing the safe and efficient operation of that asset in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly manner. Assurance Assurance refers to stakeholders in a project who cannot wait until a project is completed, and handover to the operations team imminent, to discover that something has been omitted or overlooked which would subsequently prevent operation of the asset in the manner stated above. The word 'assurance' refers to the act of reassuring the various stakeholders in a project or venture that their asset and organisation is in a state of operations readiness, or providing a measure of assurance that it will be by the time it is required. Implementing methods The first issue facing an OR&A; practitioner on a project is how to disseminate the vast amount of information required to implement OR&A; in a way that neither 'swamps' users in a sea of information nor 'starves' them of vital information required to complete the various activities and tasks at the appropriate time. Some methods developed to address this problem involve the use of a secure private cloud-based system, to allow the user to manage the volume of information within the system, and to present it in a manageable way. This system, accessed though a secure login over the internet, provides a central point for the management of information, minimising the maintenance requirements for the system, and ensuring that all users can access the information.

Background Their territory lies on the border with Afghanistan and historically they migrated between the hills during the summer and the valleys in the winter. Although primarily a pastoral tribe, they and the related Mehsud tribe — with whom they have a historical antipathy — were described by Arnold Fletcher in 1965 as \\"perhaps the most powerful and aggressive of the border Pushtoons\\". The Utmanzai form one of the two major branches of the Wazir tribe, with the other being the Ahmadzai of South Waziristan Agency. The Utmanzai branch is further subdivided, for example into tribes such as the Bakka Khel and Jani Khel. The common ancestor of the Ahmadzai and Utmanzai is the eponymous Wazir, who is also ancestor to the Mehsuds who have since taken a distinct and divergent path. Through Wazir, the tribes trace their origins to Karlanri and thence to the founder of the Pashtun lineage, Qais Abdur Rashid. The North and South Waziristan agencies together form the region of Waziristan, which derives its name from this supra-tribe. In December 2012, the government of North Waziristan Agency used its powers under the Frontier Crimes Regulations to remove privileges from the Utmanzai, such as honorariums given to tribal elders. The government also ordered that the issue of official documentation, such as national identity cards and passports, to members of the tribe should cease. These measures were taken in an attempt to force members of the tribe to provide security for teams who were running a polio vaccination campaign in the area. The Shura Mujahideen, led by Hafiz Gul Bahadur — a member of the tribe and a militant leader associated with Tehrik- i-Taliban Pakistan — had issued an order in June 2012 that the campaign should be opposed until drone attacks by the United States ended. Tribal members also believed that the US took advantage of vaccination campaigns for intelligence purposes and that it was a fake vaccination campaign in Abbotabad that had led to the tracing of the Al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden. The restrictions were lifted temporarily in February 2013 to allow voter registration to be completed.

He was also the author of the first chess handbook in German – Neue theoretisch-praktische Anweisung zum Schachspiel (Vienna 1795–96).W. Litmanowicz and J. Giżycki (1986, 1987). Szachy od A do Z. Wydawnictwo Sport i Turystyka Warszawa. (1. A-M), (2. N-Z) About his biography Relatively few details of his life are known. Only a few years after his death almost all information concerning his life, including dates of birth and death, were lost. Daniel Fiske traveled to Vienna between 1862 and 1863 and searched the archives of the city for some details about him, but in vain. Only in 1870 Anton Baron Reisner (a founder of the and collaborator of the '), by working in archives and by interviewing Allgaier's family members and others who knew him, managed to recover some details of the life of this master. Subsequently, it was discovered that some information was also present in the memories of Karl Heinrich von Ritters Lang written in 1842, but not known to the chess historians of the time.cited in Biography Johann Baptist Allgaier was born in 1763 in the Duchy of Württemberg; his mother tongue was the Swabian dialect. His father, Georg Allgaier, was employed at a monastery as a Hofmeister, the person, who, in those days, was in charge of the education of the children of the rich and noble families. The young Johann received a Catholic education and was directed by his father towards the study of theology. Following a trip to Poland, however, he learned chess from a Polish Jew and the game became his main interest at the expense of the study of theology. Subsequently, in 1798, he moved to Vienna and joined the army.P. R. von Bilguer, Handbuch des schachspiels (1891) pages 49–50 In the Austrian capital, he was able to improve his chess skills. Towards the end of 1780, he won an important match from which he earned 1500 florins and the reputation of the city's best player. This allowed Allgaier access to the aristocratic circles of the capital where he gave chess lessons. He also became the teacher of the sons and brothers of the Emperor Francis II. Since Allgaier was in the army, he participated in the Napoleonic wars between Austria and France. In 1809, he was employed in a field hospital, where he became ill with chronic asthma. Later it was moved to Prague where he became an accountant at the military hospital. He returned to Vienna in 1816 where the Emperor gave him, for health reasons (asthma), a modest pension. In order to make some additional money, he played chess in the Cafés of Vienna, and in particular to the Zur Goldenen Krone, the meeting place of many strong players in the capital, including Anton Witthalm and the Count Johann Somssich.D. Hooper and K, Whyld, The Oxford Companion to Chess (2nd ed.), 1992, page 18 Witthalm was one of the persons interviewed by Anton Baron Reisner to reconstruct Allgaier's life of that period. Witthalm reported that Allgaier's style was brilliant and mainly focused on attacking, while Somssich, by contrast, was more cautious and defensive. When Allgaier played, a crowd of spectators gathered at the premises of the Café to admire his brilliant play. Santo Vito, who edited the 6th and 7th edition of Allgaier's book, collected some of these games in an appendix. Allgaier was used to accept the challenge of anyone for a gulden. This price for weaker players, also included a short lesson of the master after the game. In fact, Allgaier throughout most of his life had to deal with a constant shortage of money as it emerges from the memoirs of Karl Heinrich von Ritters Lang. Financial problems were often the reasons, for some players, to accept Mälzel's offer to operate the Turk. Allgaier played hidden in the chess Automaton in 1809.D. Fiske, The Book of the first American Chess Congress (1859) page 431 A game played that year by the Turk against Napoleon at Schönbrunn Palace is attributed to Allgaier.Napoleon – The Turk Schönbrunn 1809 at chessgames.com At the end of December 1822, he was admitted to the military hospital in Vienna and died a few days later of dropsy. The fact that he died in a public institution, although he was married, gives, according to Anton Baron Reisner, a clear proof of Allgaier's shortage of money. This was also confirmed by the papers of his legacy, which Reisner examined. Influence on chess In 1795 and 1796 published in Vienna (in two volumes) his book Neue Theoretische-praktische Anweisung zum Schachspiel, which was regarded in some parts of Europe as the best text book of the timeD. Hooper and K. Whyld, The Oxford Companion to Chess (2nd ed.), 1992, page 18 and was reprinted several times, even after his death; the seventh and final edition was in 1843. From his treatise, it is clear that Allgaier knew very well the literature of his time. He was influenced both by the ideas of Philidor and the Modenese School (del Rio, Lolli and Ponziani) between which he tried some sort of compromise. The influence of the French master seemed dominant, however, and Allgaier was later called the \\"German Philidor\\".Le Palamède edited by Saint-Amant (1842) pages 105–117 Allgaier had a particular preference for the pawn , which he believed to be, ceteris paribus, a decisive advantage since it can advance, as Philidor had taught in his treatise,A. D. Philidor, Analyse du jeu des Échec (1749) against the enemy castling (e.g. e2–e4–e5, f2–f4, g2–g4, f4–f5 etc.). Unlike Philidor, however, he did not think that after 1.e4 e5 the move 2.Nf3 was a mistake. The French master believed that this move was wrong, in principle, because it prevents the f2-pawn from advancing and supporting, if needed, the e5-pawn. The pieces, according to Philidor, were better developed behind the pawns and, consequently, the knight had to be placed on e2 or f3, but only after the f-pawn was moved to f4. Often in Philidor's analysis, White occupies the center with e2–e4 followed by c2–c3 and d2–d4, starting from this configuration, the French pushed the pawn on e4 to e5 with the goal to gain space in the center and on the kingside. If the opponent attacked the e5-pawn with ... f6, Philidor supported it with f2–f4 and in case of fxe5, he continued with dxe5. At this point, having reached a configuration where White had a kingside majority, Philidor could advance the pawn e-, f-, and possibly g-pawn against the enemy castling.In order not to make the previous section too abstract, the first game of the Analyse du jeu des Échecs is here reported: 1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Bc5 3. c3 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. cxd4 Bb6 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Nge2 c6 8. Bd3 d5 9. e5 Ne8 10. Be3 f6 11. Qd2 fxe5 12. dxe5 Be6 13. Nf4 Qe7 14. Bxb6 axb6 15. O-O Nd7 16. Nxe6 Qxe6 17. f4 Nc7 18.

Bf5 Nc4 35. Nh5 Rg8+ 36. Bg4 Nd2 37. e6+ Kg6 38. f7 Rf8 39. Nf4+ Kg7 40. Bh5 1–0 According to Philidor this attack was not only winning, but, due to the fact that Black could not prevent the opponent from achieving a kingside majority, the French believed that the first player had a decisive advantage and, with perfect play, White would always win the game. The Modenese School, in contrast, preferred to develop the pieces quickly, change a couple of pawns in the center and concentrate all its forces against a specific target (usually the opponent's king). Allgaier is half-way between the two Schools, he agrees with Philidor on the force of the kingside majority, but at the same time he argues that his experience as a player and as a student of chess led him to believe that the pieces' play all'italiana was a good alternative. Thus, the move 2.Nf3 was, according to Allgaier, perfectly playable if followed by a strategy that would lead to maximize the influence of the pieces rather than pawns. The games reported by Santo Vito, which, at least part of them, were probably played by Allgaier show that he was much more inclined to tactical play where the pieces come violently in contact with each other rather than to the slow movements of infantry advocated by Philidor (this fact is also confirmed by Witthalm). Only in his writings, he is closer to Philidor, whose ideas were prevailing at the time. From this perspective, it is probably not a coincidence that the variant of the King's Gambit named after him (1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.h4 g4 5.Ng5, the so-called Allgaier's Gambit) is a particularly sharp opening. After 5... h6, in fact, White must sacrifice the knight with 6.Nxf7, leading to a very tactical game (the author's analysis on this opening line is contained in the fourth edition of the Neue Anweisung of 1819). =Style of play and games= In the sixth and seventh edition of the Neue Anweisung, Santo Vito added an appendix containing four games played by the strongest players in Vienna. Anton Witthalm, interviewed by Reisner, affirmed that Allgaier had a very tactical style of play and the games recorded by Santo Vito (or at least part of them) were played by Allgaier. These games are rare and cannot be found in the common chess databases like ChessBase, 365chess, chessbites or chesslab and, consequently, are here reported. In the original text, there were no comments to the games; punctuation and the notes between square parenthesis come from analysis carried out with the chess engine FireBird 1.2.www.chesslogik.com/Fire.htm The first and second game show a more complex tactical struggle; game three, on the other hand, indicates a very poor endgame technique.

He meets with a beautiful young woman by the name of Kamini, who at first does not disclose her name to him because she is a call girl. However, Amar names her Maya and falls in love with her. When he attempts to introduce her to his parents, on reaching his house his mother accepts her, but there she sees his father's (Sonachand's) photo and she recalls that he is the same person who had forced her into prostitution by promising her a job. He'd had an intimate relationship with her years ago and threatened her to get into this business, or else he would kidnap her sister who studies in a boarding school in Panchgani and throw her into this business. But now, Kamini/Maya has decided to leave this profession. But Sonachand does not want Amar to marry a call girl. So he tells Kamini to act like a call girl once again so that Amar leaves her. Kamini agrees to do so, because she doesn't want Amar to face problems from society as well as his family. But on the same night, Sonachand sees that his own daughter Usha has taken to prostitution. Meanwhile, Amar learns the truth about his father and shuns him. His father shoots himself because of his guilt and Amar leaves his house to go to find Kamini, and sees that she has consumed poison and is about to die. So Kamini dies and Amar is left alone.

Recording The album was recorded live at Panther Hall in Fort Worth over two nights in July 1966 with Nelson backed by Johnny Bush on drums and Wade Ray on bass, although producer Felton Jarvis had Chip Young overdub guitar parts and steel guitar fills in RCA’s Nashville studio. Despite the low sales of his tepid RCA albums, which were given the Nashville Sound treatment, Nelson enjoyed a loyal fan following his home state of Texas largely on the basis of his freewheeling live shows. Like his friend and future fellow outlaw Waylon Jennings, Nelson was covering the Beatles during this period, and Country Music Concert contains his version of \\"Yesterday\\". During the introduction Nelson jokes: :“I’d like to do a song now that, uh, that was recorded by, uh, a pretty fair little country group known as The Beatles (audience laughter), I know you’re familiar with those – you’ve heard them many times on the Grand Ole Opry. (laughs) Seriously, this is a song that, as a songwriter myself, I appreciate it very much because I think it’s a very great piece of material, and I’d like to do it for you and I hope you enjoy it. The album also includes the chilling “I Just Can’t Let You Say Goodbye,” one of the most violent songs Nelson ever penned. According to biographer Joe Nick Patoski: :One in particular, “I Just Can’t Say Goodbye,” bordered on psycho-creepy. Willie had read about a crime of passion in the newspaper and used his imagination to take it one step further. Delivered in an up-tempo Latin rhythm, it was told from the perspective of a man so distraught over his breakup and so upset by the bad things his lover is saying to him that he gets pissed off and strangles her to death. Nelson would grow increasingly irritated with RCA’s policy of only allowing Nashville studio musicians to play on recording sessions. He later recalled, \\"The music I played on the road, the music I’d cultivated with my band, had vitality. It was live music played for live people. I knew how to entertain a crowd for two, three, even four hours at a stretch...They lived in the now...Onstage, I was in charge. But in the studio, I wasn’t in charge and consequently the now escaped me. In 1976, RCA reissued this album as Willie Nelson Live. The reissue left off \\"Night Life\\", but added \\"I Gotta Get Drunk\\", a studio recording made three years after the release of this album. The song was remixed to include audience sounds not present on the original recording. In 1998, Bear Family Records reissued \\"Country Music Concert\\" in its original format (as part of the \\"Nashville Was The Roughest...\\" box set), along with three bonus tracks not on the original release: \\"I Love You Because\\", a jazzy take on Hank Williams' \\"There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight\\", and \\"I'm Still Not Over You\\" Reception Jim Worbois of AllMusic states, “This is an interesting album chronicling an early show by Nelson. From time to time, the audience will shout song titles, and he actually talks between songs. While many people don't like live albums, this is actually more fun than some of his later live records.” Track listing All tracks written by Willie Nelson, except where noted.

It was Cao's solo directorial debut, though Cao had previously co- directed the film Absolute Emotion in 2001. Based on Que Diwei's novella, \\"Village Operation,\\" which was published in a magazine in 2000, Trouble Makers had difficulty traversing the Chinese censors and often found itself lacking funds until 2005. As a result, Cao eventually inserted a happy ending that differed from ending in the original novella.  Plot  Trouble Makers tells the story of four simple men living in Black Well Village (in rural Yunnan province) who decide to finally run the criminal Xiong Brothers out of their homes. The Xiongs have managed to build a criminal \\"empire\\" in the small town even managing to elect themselves the mayor and official accountant of Black Well Village. Two other brothers enforce the Xiongs' will with violence and intimidation. The brothers, known by the political-infused moniker, the Gang of Four, smuggle salt and generally terrorize the villagers of Black Well. When Ye Guangrong, the nerdy and nervous local party secretary has had enough, he rounds up several other oppressed villagers including Tugua, an account, and Dawang, whose wife was raped by one of the brothers, to clean up the village. Guangrong and his vigilante's quickly find themselves over their heads. Hiring less than savory characters like \\"Dog Balls,\\" a kung-fu obsessed buffoon, Guangrong and his men give themselves officious sounding military titles. As events spiral out of control, a confrontation between the dangerous Xiong Brothers and Guangrong's vigilantes seems inevitable.

Release  Trouble Makers was premiered in the small village in Yunnan where it was filmed. From there, it was screened at numerous international film festivals and received its United States Premiere at the New York Asian Film Festival on June 30, 2007. The year before, the film also premiered at several other boutique festivals, including the International Thessaloniki Film Festival, which focuses on first and second features.

Elected as a Democrat, he was unopposed in the primary and won the governorship without ever making a single public campaign speech. Biography Brewer was born in Carroll County, Mississippi, near the town of Vaiden. His father, Ratliff Rodney Brewer, had been a farmer, plantation manager and overseer, and a captain in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. His middle name came from his grandfather, Leroy Brewer (1793–1851), a Mississippi Delta pioneer who migrated from Elbert County, Georgia during the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. His uncle Leroy Jasper Brewer (1833–1911), who was mayor of Holcomb at the time of Earl's gubernatorial election, died just weeks before his nephew's inauguration. Brewer attended the University of Mississippi and after less than one year of study, obtained a Bachelor of Law degree in 1892. He immediately began practicing law (among his notable clients was Janie Jones, the widow of famed railroader Casey Jones, for whom he obtained a $2,650 settlement after Jones' death) and then was elected to the Mississippi State Senate in 1895. In 1902 he was appointed district attorney for the 11th District. In 1907 he resigned his position as district attorney in order to run for governor. Brewer was narrowly defeated in his first attempt but won handily in the next campaign. As governor, Brewer promoted progressive reforms in several areas. The constitution was changed to create an elective judiciary; banking laws were established to limit interest rates; and a Bureau of Vital Statistics was created. During his term there was a severe epidemic of pellagra in the state and other portions of the South. When the federal government sent Joseph Goldberger to study the disease and find a cure, Brewer offered full pardons to convicts who would participate in Goldberger's experiments. As a result of these studies, it was determined that pellagra was caused by a vitamin deficiency. After his term was over, Brewer assisted in the defense of three Black defendants accused of murder who had been convicted on the basis of coerced confessions. Brewer argued and won their appeal to the United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Mississippi. Brewer later ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 1924. Brewer died in Jackson and is buried at Oakridge Cemetery in Clarksdale. Notable Relatives *Leroy Brewer I (1793-1851) - Grandfather and namesake of Gov. Brewer.

Three obsolete Royal Navy cruisers of the 7th Cruiser Squadron, manned mainly by reservists and sometimes referred to as the Live Bait Squadron, were sunk by U-9 while patrolling the southern North Sea. Neutral ships and trawlers nearby began to rescue survivors but about 1,450 British sailors were killed, many being reservists with families; there was a public outcry in Britain at the losses. The sinkings eroded confidence in the British government and damaged the reputation of the Royal Navy, when many countries were still unsure about taking sides in the war. Background The cruisers were part of the Southern Force (Rear-Admiral Arthur Christian) composed of the flagship , the light cruiser and the 7th Cruiser Squadron (7th CS, also known as Cruiser Squadron C, Rear-Admiral H. H. Campbell, nicknamed the live-bait squadron), comprising the armoured cruisers , , , and Euryalus, the 1st and 3rd Destroyer flotillas, ten submarines of the 8th Oversea Flotilla and the attached scout cruiser, . The force patrolled the North Sea, supporting destroyers and submarines of the Harwich Force to guard against incursions by the Imperial German Navy () into the English Channel. Concerns had been expressed about the vulnerability of the ships against modern German cruisers but the War Orders of 28 July 1914, reflecting pre-war assumptions about attacks by destroyers rather than submarines, remained in force. The ships were to patrol the area \\"south of the 54th parallel clear of enemy torpedo craft and destroyers\\" supported by Cruiser Force C during the day. The Harwich Patrol guarded the Dogger Bank and the Broad Fourteens further south; usually cruisers were to the north closer to the Dogger Bank and sailed south at night. The cruisers moved to the Broad Fourteens to reinforce the fourth cruiser during troop movements from Britain to France. Heading south put the ships closer to German bases, more vulnerable to submarine attack. Prelude On 16 September, Christian had been allowed to keep two cruisers to the north and one at the Broad Fourteens but had kept them together in a central position, able to support operations in both areas. The next day, the destroyer escorts were forced to depart by heavy weather, which remained so bad that neither patrol could be reformed. The Admiralty ordered that the ships were to cancel the Dogger Patrol and cover the Broad Fourteens until the weather abated. On 20 September, Euryalus returned to port to re-coal and by 22 September, Aboukir, Hogue and Cressy were on patrol under the command of Captain J. E. Drummond of Aboukir. The U-boat was treated lightly by the Imperial German Navy; in the first six weeks of the war, the U-boat arm had sent out ten boats, sunk no ships and lost two boats for their efforts. On the morning of 22 September, Otto Weddigen, the commander of spotted Aboukir, Hogue and Cressy. Action At 06:00 on 22 September, the weather had calmed and the ships were patrolling at , in line abreast, apart. Lookouts were posted for submarine periscopes or ships and one gun on each side of each ship was manned. U-9 had been ordered to attack British transports at Ostend but had been forced to dive and shelter from the storm. On surfacing, Weddinen spotted the British ships and moved to attack. At 06:20, U-9 fired a torpedo at the middle ship from a range of and struck Aboukir on the starboard side, flooding the engine room and causing the ship to stop immediately. No submarines had been sighted and Drummond, assuming that the ship had hit a mine, ordered the other two cruisers to close in to help. After 25 minutes, Aboukir capsized and sank five minutes later. Only one lifeboat could be launched, because of damage from the explosion and the failure of steam- powered winches needed to launch the others. U-9 rose to periscope depth after diving once the torpedo had been launched and Weddigen observed two British cruisers engaged in the rescue of men from the sinking ship. Weddigen fired two more torpedoes at Hogue, from . As the torpedoes left the submarine, her bows rose out of the water and she was spotted by Hogue, whose gunners opened fire before the submarine dived. The two torpedoes struck Hogue and within five minutes Captain Wilmot Nicholson gave the order to abandon ship; after ten minutes she capsized before sinking at 07:15. Watchers on Cressy had seen the submarine, opened fire and made a failed attempt to ram, then turned to pick up survivors. At 07:20, U-9 fired two torpedoes toward Cressy from her stern torpedo tubes at a range of . One torpedo missed and the submarine turned and fired her remaining bow torpedo at . The first torpedo struck the starboard side at around 07:25, the second the port beam at 07:30. The ship capsized to starboard and floated upside down until 07:55. Two Dutch sailing trawlers in the vicinity declined to close with Cressy for fear of mines. Distress calls had been received by Tyrwhitt, who, with the destroyer squadron, was already at sea returning to the cruisers, now that the weather had improved. At 08:30, the Dutch steamship Flora approached the scene and rescued 286 men; Titan another steamer picked up another 147 men. More were rescued by the Lowestoft sailing trawlers, Coriander and J.G.C., before the destroyers arrived at 10:45, 837 men were rescued but 1,397 men and 62 officers—many of them reservists–were killed, including Robert Johnson, the Captain of Cressy. The destroyers began a search for the submarine, which had little electrical power remaining to travel underwater and could only make on the surface. The submarine submerged for the night and returned to base the next day. Aftermath The disaster shook public confidence in Britain and the world in the Royal Navy. Other cruisers were withdrawn from patrol duties; Christian was reprimanded and Drummond was criticized by the Court of Inquiry for failing to take the anti-submarine precautions recommended by the Admiralty and praised for his conduct during the attack. The 28 officers and 258 men rescued by Flora were landed at IJmuiden and were repatriated on 26 September. Wenman \\"Kit\\" Wykeham-Musgrave (1899–1989) survived being torpedoed on all three ships. His daughter recalled Wykeham-Musgrave survived the war and rejoined the Royal Navy in 1939, reaching the rank of commander. Weddigen and his crew returned to a heroes' welcome; Weddigen was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st Class and his crew each received the Iron Cross, 2nd Class. The sinking of the three ships caused the danger of U-boat attack to be taken more seriously by the Admiralty. Commander Dudley Pound, serving in the Grand Fleet as a commander aboard the battleship (who became First Sea Lord) wrote in his diary on 24 September, In 1954, the British government sold the salvage rights to the ships and work began in 2011.

The last stanza of Patty Hill's and Mildred Hill's famous song, \\"Good Morning to You\\" (unofficially titled \\"Happy Birthday to You\\") is typically sung by the guests at some point in the proceedings. In some countries a piñata takes the place of a cake. =Name days= In some historically Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox countries such as Italy, Spain, France, parts of Germany, Poland, Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Greece, Lithuania, Latvia, and throughout Latin America, it is common to have a 'name day'/'Saint's day'. It is celebrated in much the same way as a birthday, but it is held on the official day of a saint with the same Christian name as the birthday person; the difference being that one may look up a person's name day in a calendar, or easily remember common name days (for example, John or Mary); however in pious traditions, the two were often made to concur by giving a newborn the name of a saint celebrated on its birthday, or possibly the name of a feast, for example, Noel or Pascal (French for Christmas and \\"of Easter\\"); as another example, Togliatti was given Palmiro as his first name because he was born on Palm Sunday. =Official birthdays= Colored lanterns at the Lotus Lantern Festival in Seoul, South Korea, celebrating the anniversary of the Buddha's birthday Some notables, particularly monarchs, have an official birthday on a fixed day of the year, which may not necessarily match the day of their birth, but on which celebrations are held. Examples are: * Jesus Christ's traditional birthday is celebrated as Christmas Eve or Christmas Day around the world, on December 24 or 25, respectively. As some Eastern churches use the Julian calendar, December 25 will fall on January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. These dates are traditional and have no connection with the actual birthday date of Jesus, which is not recorded in the Gospels * Similarly, the birthdays of the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist are liturgically celebrated on September 8 and June 24, especially in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions (although for those Eastern Orthodox churches using the Julian calendar the corresponding Gregorian dates are September 21 and July 7 respectively). As with Christmas, the dates of these celebrations are traditional and probably have no connection with the actual birthdays of these individuals. * The Queen's Official Birthday in Australia, Fiji, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. * The Grand Duke's Official Birthday in Luxembourg is typically celebrated on June 23. This is different from the monarch's actual date of birth, which is on April 16. * Koninginnedag in the Kingdom of the Netherlands was typically celebrated on April 30. Queen Beatrix fixed it at the birthday of her mother, the previous queen, to avoid the winter weather associated with her own birthday in January. The present monarch's birthday is 27 April, and is also celebrated on that day and has replaced the 30th of April celebration of Koninginnedag. * The previous Japanese Emperor Showa (Hirohito)'s birthday was April 29. After his death, the holiday was kept as \\"Showa no Hi\\", or \\"Showa Day\\". This holiday falls close to Golden Week, the week in late April and early May. * Kim Il- sung and Kim Jong-Il's birthdays are celebrated in North Korea as a national holiday. * Washington's Birthday, commonly referred to as Presidents' Day, is a federal holiday in the United States that celebrates the birthday of George Washington. President Washington's birthday is observed on the third Monday of February each year. However, his actual birth date was either February 11 (Old Style), or February 22 (New Style). * In India, every year October 2 which marks the Birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, is declared as a holiday. All the liquor shops are closed across the country in honour of Gandhi not consuming liquor. * Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is a federal holiday in the United States marking the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. It is observed on the third Monday of January each year, which is around the time of King's birthday, January 15. * Mawlid is the official birthday of Muhammad and is celebrated on the 12th or 17th day of Rabi' al-awwal by adherents of Sunni and Shia Islam respectively. These are the two most commonly accepted dates of birth of Muhammad.  Distribution through the year  A birthday cake for an 18th birthday Some restaurants place a birthday candle on the dessert of a birthday customer's choice A young child preparing to extinguish the candle of his first birthday – 1983 According to a public database of births, birthdays in the United States are quite evenly distributed for the most part, but there tend to be more births in September and October.Anybirthday. Anybirthday. Retrieved on 2013-01-01. This may be because there is a holiday season nine months before (the human gestation period is about nine months), or because the longest nights of the year also occur in the Northern Hemisphere nine months before. However, it appears the holidays have more of an effect on birth rates than the winter: New Zealand, a Southern Hemisphere country, has the same September and October peak with no corresponding peak in March and April. The least common birthdays tend to fall around public holidays, such as Christmas, New Year's Day and fixed-date holidays such as July 4 in the US. Based on Harvard University research of birth records in the United States between 1973 and 1999, September 16 is the most common birthday in the United States and December 25 the least common birthday (other than February 29, because of leap years). In 2011, October 5 and 6 were reported as the most frequently occurring birthdays.Christina Ng (2011-10-05) Oct. 5: America’s Most Common Birthday ABC News In New Zealand, the most common birthday is September 29, and the least common birthday is December 25. The ten most common birthdays all fall within a thirteen-day period, between September 22 and October 4. The ten least common birthdays (other than February 29) are December 24–27, January 1–2, February 6, March 22, April 1 and April 25. This is based on all live births registered in New Zealand between 1980 and 2017. According to a study by the Yale School of Public Health, positive and negative associations with culturally significant dates may influence birth rates. The study shows a 5.3% decrease in spontaneous births and a 16.9% decrease in Caesarean births on Halloween, compared to dates occurring within one week before and one week after the October holiday. In contrast, on Valentine's Day there is a 3.6% increase in spontaneous births and a 12.1% increase in Caesarean births.Greenwood, Michael. (2011-10-10) Halloween, Valentine’s Day Found to Influence Birth Timing . Publichealth.yale.edu. Retrieved on 2013-01-01. Leap day In the Gregorian calendar (a common solar calendar), February in a leap year has 29 days instead of the usual 28, so the year lasts 366 days instead of the usual 365. A person born on February 29 may be called a \\"leapling\\" or a \\"leaper\\". In common years they usually celebrate their birthdays on February 28. In some situations, March 1 is used as the birthday in a non-leap year since it is the day following February 28. Technically, a leapling will have fewer birthday anniversaries than their age in years. This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only. In Gilbert and Sullivan's 1879 comic opera The Pirates of Penzance, Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st birthday rather than until his 21st year. For legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals. In cultures and religionsAncient Persia= According to Herodotus (5th century BC), of all the days in the year, the one which the Persians celebrate most is their birthday. It was customary to have the board furnished on that day with an ampler supply than common: the richer people eat wholly baked cow, horse, camel, or donkey (), while the poorer classes use instead the smaller kinds of cattle. =Ancient Rome= The Romans enthusiastically celebrated birthdays with hedonistic parties and generous presents. =China= Chinese birthday traditions reflect the culture's deep-seated focus on longevity and wordplay. From the homophony between (\\"rice wine\\") and (meaning \\"long\\" in the sense of time passing), osmanthus and other rice wines are traditional gifts for birthdays in China. Longevity noodles are another traditional food consumed on the day,Li Xiaoxiang. Origins of Chinese People and Customs (2004) p. 101. Asiapac Books (Singapore). . although western-style birthday cakes are increasingly common among urban Chinese. =Judaism= In Judaism, the perspective on birthday celebrations is disputed by various rabbis, although today it is accepted practice by most of the faithful.Reb Chaim HaQoton: Happy Birthday! April 17, 2007 In the Hebrew Bible, the one single mention of a celebration being held in commemoration of someone's day of birth is for the Egyptian Pharaoh which is recorded in . Rabbi Moshe Feinstein always acknowledged birthdays. The Lubavitcher Rebbe encouraged people to celebrate their birthdays, by gathering friends, making positive resolutions, and through various religious observances. According to Rabbi Yissocher Frand, the anniversary of a person's birth is a special day for that person's prayers to be accepted. The bar mitzvah of 13-year-old Jewish boys, or bat mitzvah for 12-year-old Jewish girls, is perhaps the only Jewish celebration undertaken in what is often perceived to be in coalition with a birthday. Despite modern celebrations where the secular \\"birthday\\" element often overshadows the essence of it as a religious rite, the essence of a bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah celebration is entirely religious in origin (i.e. the attainment of religious maturity according to Jewish law), however, and not secular. With or without the birthday celebration, the child nevertheless becomes a bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah, and the celebration may be on that day or any date after it. =Christianity=Christianity: Early centuries Origen in his commentary \\"On Levites\\" writes that Christians should not only refrain from celebrating their birthdays, but should look on them with disgust.John Bugge (1975) Early Christians,” notes The World Book Encyclopedia, “considered the celebration of anyone’s birth to be a pagan custom.” The ancient Greeks, for instance, believed that each person had a protective spirit that attended the person’s birth and thereafter watched over him. That spirit “had a mystic relation with the god on whose birthday the individual was born,” says the book The Lore of Birthdays. Birthdays also have a long-standing and an intimate link with astrology and the horoscope. 11 Besides rejecting birthday customs on account of pagan and spiritistic roots, God’s servants of old likely rejected them on principle as well. Why? These were humble, modest men and women who did not view their arrival in the world as so important that it should be celebrated. (Micah 6:8; Luke 9:48) Rather, they glorified Jehovah and thanked him for the precious gift of life.—Psalm 8:3, 4; 36:9; Revelation 4:11. Virginitas: an essay in the history of a medieval ideal, Springer , p. 69 Christianity: Medieval Ordinary folk celebrated their saint's day (the saint they were named after), but nobility celebrated the anniversary of their birth. The \\"Squire's Tale\\", one of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, opens as King Cambuskan proclaims a feast to celebrate his birthday.Margaret Hallissy (1995) A Companion to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Greenwood Publishing Group , p. 300 Religious: Modern While almost all Christians accept the practice today, Jehovah's Witnesses and some Sacred Name groups refrain from celebrating birthdays due to the custom's pagan origins, its connections to magic and superstitions. While Christmas is the celebration of Christ's Birth, some religious groups see it as being portrayed in a negative light.Awake! July 8, 2004, p. 30 \\"Religions refrain from any celebrations or customs that continue to involve false religious beliefs or activities that violate their principles. For example, their views definitely put birthday celebrations in a bad light.\\"The World Book Encyclopedia: Vol. 3, p. 416Are Birthday Celebrations Christian?. Thercg.org. Retrieved on 2013-01-01.

Systemoflife.com Article. Retrieved on 2013-01-01. =Hinduism= Hindus celebrate the birth anniversary day every year when the day that corresponds to lunar month or solar month (Sun Signs Nirayana System – Sourava Mana Masa) of birth and has the same asterism (Star/Nakshatra) as that of the date of birth. That age is reckoned whenever Janma Nakshatra of the same month passes. Hindus regard death to be more auspicious than birth since the person is liberated from the bondages of material society. Also, traditionally, rituals & prayers for the departed are observed on 5th and 11th day with many relatives gathering. =Buddhism (Mahayana)= Many monasteries celebrate the anniversary of Buddha's birth, usually in a highly formal, ritualized manner.

The event is named after a hardy, blooming tree known as the Dogwood, that adds so much beauty to the spring landscape in Kentucky. The Dogwood Stakes was run in two divisions in 1981. The event was upgraded to Grade III in 1998. However, the event lost this classification for the 2016 running and was a Listed event. The event regained its Grade III status in 2020. The 2019 winner Covfefe, would later win the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint and become champion female sprinter and champion 3-year- old filly. =Distances= Since its inauguration in 1975, the race has been contested at a variety of distances: * 7 furlongs : 1975-1981, 2013 to present * miles : 1982, 1986-2005 * 1 mile : 2006-2012 * miles : 1983-1985 Records ;Speed records * 7 furlongs: 1:22.28 - Four Graces (2020) * 1 mile: 1:34.56 - Acoma (2008) * miles: 1:42.73 - Take Charge Lady (2002) ;Margins: * 8 lengths - Covfefe (2019) ;Most wins by a jockey * 4 - Larry Melancon (1982, 1984, 1994, 1996) * 4 - Pat Day (1983, 1989, 1997, 1998) ;Most wins by a trainer * 5 - D.

It stars Rajendra Kumar, with Mala Sinha as his wife, and Hema Malini as his past love, who has re-entered his life to seek vengeance for abandoning her years ago. The film is a remake of a Telugu film titled Pandanti Kapuram (1972).Somaaya, Bhawana Hema Malini: The Authorized Biography. New Delhi: The Lotus Collection (2007) In the annals of Hindi cinema, this movie, though not a commercial success, is unique for three reasons. First, it features music by Naushad collaborating for the first time with the lyricist Anand Bakshi. Secondly, this picture has for the only time Kishore Kumar singing a song (in a duet with Asha Bhonsle) for which music was composed by Naushad. Thirdly, the movie has the leading lady Hema Malini playing a rare negative role. Hema Malini's role, like in 'Lal Patthar', has negative shades to it, though in both movies, the character played by her becomes positive in the end. Plot Chandrashekhar, younger brother of Shankarlal marries an orphan named Laxmi on insistence of Shankerla's dying wife. Chandrashekhar and Laxcmi soon have three children, a girl and two boys. Chandrashekhar's elder brother, Madhu, returns home as the local District Collector, and marries wealthy Chamanlal's daughter, Shobha, while Ravi is romancing his beautiful neighbor, Neelu. All is going well till when the mill where Chandrashekhar is employed goes on strike. The mill-owner sells the mill to Rani Padmavati, who first of all wants Chandrashekhar to be fired before she can consider the workers' demands. The workers go on an indefinite hunger strike until Chandrashekhar decides to quit his job and re-locates to the city to look for work. In the meantime, misunderstandings crop up between Shobha and the rest of the family, and she and Madhu leave the house to live with Chamanlal. Chandrashekhar is unable to find any employment as Rani Padmavati refuses to give him a reference and on the contrary uses her influence to ensure that he never gets a job. Defeated by circumstances Chandrashekhar returns home to find out that the Rani had ganged up with the local money-lenders and has taken over his land and property. Then the police arrest Chandrashekhar on the complaint filed by the Rani on the charge of stealing from his former employer. On the verge of losing her ill son, Laxmi, now penniless, must now find out why Rani Padmavati has taken it upon herself to ruin this family.

Keats wrote the first five poems, \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\", \\"Ode on Indolence\\", \\"Ode on Melancholy\\", \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\", and \\"Ode to Psyche\\" in quick succession during the spring, and he composed \\"To Autumn\\" in September. While the exact order in which Keats composed the poems is unknown, some critics contend that they form a thematic whole if arranged in sequence. As a whole, the odes represent Keats's attempt to create a new type of short lyrical poem, which influenced later generations. Background The entrance to Guy's Hospital in 1820 Early in 1819, Keats left his poorly paid position as dresser (or assistant house surgeon) at Guy's Hospital, Southwark, London to completely devote himself to a career in poetry. In the past, he had relied on his brother George for financial assistance from time to time, but now, when his brother appealed to him for the same aid, the cash-strapped poet was unable to help and was overwhelmed with guilt and despair. He decided to forsake the life of a poet for a more lucrative career – but not before allowing himself a few months of poetic indulgence.Bate 1963, pp. 525–7 Keats lived at Wentworth Place during the composition of his 1819 odes. It was during the months of spring 1819 that he wrote many of his major odes. Following the month of May 1819, he began to tackle other forms of poetry, including a play, some longer pieces, and a return to his unfinished epic, Hyperion. His brother's financial woes continued to loom over him, and, as a result, Keats had little energy or inclination for composition, but, on 19 September 1819, he managed to compose To Autumn, his last major work and the one that rang the curtain down on his career as a poet.Bate 1963, p.562 Structure After writing \\"Ode to Psyche\\", Keats sent the poem to his brother and explained his new ode form: \\"I have been endeavouring to discover a better Sonnet stanza than we have. The legitimate does not suit the language well, from the pouncing rhymes; the other appears too elegiac, and the couplet at the end of it has seldom a pleasing effect. I do not pretend to have succeeded. It will explain itself.\\"Keats 2008 p. 162 Writing these poems had a particular influence on Keats, as Walter Jackson Bate explains: > However felicitous he may have been in writing them, these short poems of > one of the greatest of English lyrists are the by-product of other efforts; > and those habits of both ideal and practice left him more dissatisfied than > he would otherwise have been with the pressure of most lyric forms toward > quick, neat solution [...] The new ode form appealed also because it was > sufficiently confining to challenge his conscience as a craftsman. Finally, > the union of amplitude and formal challenge offered unique opportunities as > well for the concentrated intensity and concreteness of idiom that he had > begun to master in Hyperion.Bate 1963 pp. 499–500 In \\"Ode to Psyche\\", Keats incorporated a narrative structure that sets the scene, gives background information, and then ends with a conclusion. Of these structural elements, the preface was discontinued in his next odes and the setting is reduced within the other odes until the scene is merely implied.Bate 1963 pp. 490–491 Poems The exact chronological and interpretive orders of the six 1819 poems are unknown, but \\"Ode to Psyche\\" was probably written first and \\"To Autumn\\" last.Bate 1963 p. 498 Keats simply dated the others May 1819. However, he worked on the spring poems together, and they form a sequence within their structures.Gittings 1968 p. 311 =Ode on a Grecian Urn= Tracing made by Keats of the Sosibios Vase \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" is a lyric ode with five stanzas containing 10 lines each. The first stanza begins with the narrator addressing an ancient urn as \\"Thou still unravished bride of quietness!\\", initiating a conversation between the poet and the object, which the reader is allowed to observe from a third-person point of view.Sheley 2007 By describing the object as a \\"foster-child of silence and slow time\\", the poet describes the urn as both a silent object, a theme which reoccurs throughout the poem, and a stone object that resists change.Bloom 1993 Throughout the first two stanzas, the speaker addresses the urn as a single object, taking note of its silence at several points as he discusses unheard melodies and tunes heard not by the sensual ear (line 13). In Keats, Narrative, and Audience, Andrew Bennett suggests that the discussion between the poet and the urn at the beginning of the poem leaves the reader to examine more than just the relationship between the two but also his place as a third-party observer.Bennett. 1994. p.133-134 With line 17, the second stanza begins to change tone as the poet shifts his focus from the urn as a whole to the individuals represented in the artwork. The two lovers, whose image the unknown artist has created through his craftsmanship, appear to the poet as a couple who cannot kiss yet do not grow old. Again the narrator discusses the urn in terms of its unaging qualities by saying, \\"She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss\\" (line 19), but he also focuses on the inability of the lovers to ever obtain sensual pleasure due to their static nature.Bloom p. 417In this Ode the poet compares the urn with the bride sitting in silence He also compares it with a foster's child.In the 2nd stanza he describes his feelings when he listens unheard music He says that unheard melodies are sweeter than heard melodies.In the 3rd,4th,&5th stanza he presents his observations about the painting on the surface of the urn. As the poem comes to a close, the narrator once again addresses the urn as a single object. However, his tone becomes sharper as he seeks answers from the work of art that it appears unable to answer.Bloom p. 419 In the final couplet, the poet provides a line for the urn, which complicates the narrative and has generated a multitude of critical responses as to the author's intent: \\"Beauty is truth—truth beauty / that is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know\\" (lines 49–50).Evert 1965 p. 319 =Ode on Indolence= \\"Ode on Indolence\\" comprises six stanzas containing ten lines each. The poem discusses a morning of laziness on the part of the narrator, during which his attention becomes captivated by three figures he sees in a vision. Beginning with an epitaph taken from Matthew 6:28, the poet introduces the theme of indolence through an excerpt of Jesus's suggestion that God provides for the lilies of the field without making them toil.Wu 1995 p. 1401 The poem describes the three figures as wearing \\"placid sandals\\" and \\"white robes\\", which alludes to the Grecian mythology that commonly appears in the 1819 odes. The images pass the narrator three times, which causes him to compare them to images on a spinning urn (line 7). In line 10, the narrator uses the word \\"Phidian\\" again as a reference to the Elgin marbles, whose creation was thought to have been overseen by Phidias, a Grecian artist. As the poem progresses, the narrator begins to discuss the intrusion upon his indolence by the figures of Love, Ambition, and Poesy, and he suggests that the images have come to \\"steal away\\" his idle days.Smith 1981 p. 138 In the final stanzas, the figure of Poesy is described as a daemon which Helen Vendler suggests poses a direct threat to the idleness the poet wishes to retain.Vendler 1983 p. 20 In the final lines, the poet once again rejects the three images: \\"Vanish, ye phantoms, from my idle spright, / Into the clouds, and never more return!\\" (lines 39–40) with the intention of once again enjoying the laziness from which the poem obtains its title.Bate 1963 p. 529 =Ode on Melancholy= \\"Ode on Melancholy\\" is the shortest of the 1819 spring odes at three stanzas of 10 lines. Originally, the poem contained four stanzas, but the original first stanza was removed before publication in 1820 for stylistic reasons.Bloom 1971, p.413 The poem describes the narrator's opinions on melancholy and is addressed specifically to the reader, unlike the narrative of many of the other odes. The lyric nature of the poem allows the poet to describe the onset of melancholy and then provides the reader with different methods of dealing with the emotions involved. Using personification, the poem creates characters out of Joy, Pleasure, Delight, and Beauty, and allows them to interact with two other characters which take the shape of a male and his female mistress mentioned (line 17). Keats himself fails to appear as a character in the poem, as there is no mention of the poet himself suffering from melanchname=Stewart>Stewart 1990, p. 172 In the final stanza, the poet describes the mistress as dwelling in Beauty, but modifies the beauty by saying that it \\"must die\\" (line 21). Harold Bloom suggests that this provides the poem with a hint of Keats's philosophy of negative capability, as only the beauty that will die meets the poem's standard of true beauty. The image of the bursting of Joy's grape (line 28) gives the poem a theme of sexuality. According to critics, the bursting of the grape alludes to the passing from the moment of ultimate sexual pleasure to the decreased pleasure of a post-orgasmic state.McFarland 2000, pp. 94–6. =Ode to a Nightingale= Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" is the longest of the 1819 odes with 8 stanzas containing 10 lines each. The poem begins by describing the state of the poet, using negative statements to intensify the description of the poet's physical state such as \\"numbless pains\\" and \\"not through envy of thy happy lot\\" (lines 1–5). While the ode is written \\"to a Nightingale\\", the emphasis of the first line is placed upon the narrator rather than the bird, and Helen Vendler suggests that the negation of the reader as a party in the discourse happens just as the song of the nightingale becomes the \\"voice of pure self-expression\\".Vendler. 1983. p.20 In the third stanza, the poet asks the nightingale to \\"Fade far away\\", casting it off just as the narrator in \\"Ode to Indolence\\" rejects the Love, Ambition, and Poesy and the poet in \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" banishes the figures on the urn to silence. In the fourth stanza, the poet states that he will fly to the nightingale rather than it to him, moving upon the \\"wings of Poesy\\", which leaves Walter Jackson Bate to believe that while the poet intends to identify with the bird by describing the poem as being \\"to\\" it, the real identification in the narrative exists between the poet and his perceptions of the nightingale's song.Bate. 1953. p.500 In its closing, the poem questions whether the bird's song has been real or part of a dream: \\"Was it a vision, or a waking dream? / Fled is that music:—do I wake or sleep?\\" (lines 79–80), and the theme of imagination once again arises as the poet appears, according to Timothy Hilton, unable to distinguish between his own artistic imagination and the song which he believes to have spurred it into action.Hilton. 1971. =Ode to Psyche= \\"Ode to Psyche\\" is a 67-line poem written in stanzas of varying length, which took its form from modification Keats made to the sonnet structure.Bate 1963, pp. 490–1 The ode is written to a Grecian mythological character, displaying a great influence of Classical culture as the poet begins his discourse with \\"O GODDESS!\\" (line 1). Psyche, a creature so beautiful that she drew the attention of Cupid himself, draws the attention of the narrator, whose artistic imagination causes him to dream of her: \\"Surely I dream'd to-day, or did I see / The wingèd Psyche with awaken'd eyes\\" (lines 5–6). As he relates himself to the mythical character of Cupid, he confuses the god's emotions with his own and imagines that he too has fallen in love with the woman's beauty. The poet does, however, understand the temporal difference between the characters of ancient Greece and his own as he declares, \\"even in these days [...] I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired\\" (lines 40–43). In line 50, the poet states \\"Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane\\", which, Harold Bloom suggests, implies that the poet himself becomes a \\"prophet of the soul\\" as he regards the beauty of Psyche and attempts to place himself within Cupid's personage.Bloom 1964, p.95 According to T.S. Eliot, it is the most prominent ode among the six great odes. =To Autumn= Unrestored manuscript copy of \\"To Autumn\\" \\"To Autumn\\" is a 33-line poem broken into three stanzas of 11. It discusses how autumn is both a force of growth and maturation, and deals with the theme of approaching death. While the earlier 1819 odes perfected techniques and allowed for variations that appear within \\"To Autumn\\", Keats dispenses with some aspects of the previous poems (such as the narrator) to focus on the themes of autumn and life. The poem discusses ideas without a progression of the temporal scene, an idea that Keats termed as \\"stationing\\".Bate 1963, pp. 581–2 The three stanzas of the poem emphasize this theme by shifting the imagery from summer to early winter and also day turning into dusk.Sperry 1973, p.337 Critical reception Keats's use of the odal hymn in his six odes, along with his use of the odal hymn with a responsal voice in \\"Ode to a Grecian Urn\\" and \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\", created, according to Walter Jackson Bate, \\"a new tone for the English lyric.\\"Bate 1963, p.499 Bate, when speaking about the 1819 odes, wrote: \\"The productivity of the three and a half weeks that begins on April 21 is difficult to parallel in the career of any modern writer. Yet to Keats it was not even a new beginning. It was rather a matter of becoming more alive in preparation for the next beginning.\\"Bate 1963, p.484 In addition to this, Bate argued that \\"It is because \\"To Autumn\\" is so uniquely a distillation, and at many different levels, that each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English. We need not be afraid of continuing to use the adjective [...] The 'Ode to a Nightingale,' for example, is a less 'perfect' though a greater poem.\\"Bate 1963, p.581 Charles Patterson argued the relationship of \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" as the greatest 1819 ode of Keats, \\"The meaningfulness and range of the poem, along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of \\"To Autumn\\" but is much superior in these qualities to the \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom.\\"Patterson 1968, p.57 Later, Ayumi Mizukoshi argued that early audiences did not support \\"Ode to Psyche\\" because it \\"turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" drew neither attention nor admiration. Herbert Grierson believed \\"Nightingale\\" to be superior to the other odes because it and \\"To Autumn\\" were more logical and contained stronger arguments.Grierson 1928, p.55 Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'.\\"Mizukoshi 2001, p.170 NotesReferences *Bate, Walter Jackson.

His thesis, Luca Marenzio and the Italian Madrigal, 1577-1593, was published as a book (Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press) in 1981. He is the author of many articles on secular music in Italy in the late 16th century; these have appeared in Early Music, the Journal of American Musicology, Journal of Musicology, Music & Letters, The Musical Times, Notes, the Rivista italiana di musicologia, Il saggiatore musicale, Studi musicali and other periodicals and Festschrifts. In his writings several previously anonymous madrigal texts are identified, and the intimate ties between poets, musicians and patrons are explored. Chater was a Fellow of the Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies (Villa I Tatti, Florence) from 1981–82. From 1982 to 1986 James Chater taught history of music at the University of Wales (Aberystwyth), Washington University in St. Louis (USA), the University of Victoria (BC, Canada) and the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). From 1986 to 1997 he was English-language Editor of classical music CD booklets for Philips Classics Records (Baarn, The Netherlands), and has been pursuing a career in publishing ever since then. Compositions From the 1990s James Chater has also been active as a composer. The focus of his activities in this field has been the composing and arranging of choral works for liturgical use within the Orthodox Church, of which he has been a member since 1995. Most of his liturgical works are written to texts in the English, Dutch and French languages, with a few other compositions in Church Slavonic. In a number of articles and conference papers (which have appeared in In Communion, The Messenger, the 2005 and 2007 Proceedings of the International Society for Orthodox Church Music (ISOCM) and Sourozh) he has addressed issues of liturgical music in the Orthodox parishes of countries that are not traditionally Orthodox. These topics include translation, the relationship between text and music, and striking the right balance between conservation and creativity. His works have been performed in Finland, Russia and Serbia. Recordings In 2008 a recording of his Great Prokeimenon for Forgiveness Sunday, sung by the Orthodox Choir of Joensuu University directed by Petri Nykänen, was issued on as part of the CD anthology \\"Oi Kuningas ja Herra\\" (\\"O King and Lord\\").

He lives as a son of all residents of the colony and helps them with their financial needs by stealing and because of this he is often jailed for some months. He is affectionately called \\"Raju\\" by Hindus and \\"Khan\\" by Muslims. Prem Singh (Prem Chopra) intends to build a hotel in the colony and compels people to vacate the place or pay Rs.10000 as rent. Actually, the land belongs to Neetu, the princess of Raigadh. Prem urges Neetu to marry him so that he can own the land of Juhu. But Neetu (Neetu Singh) resists the proposal. Neetu's uncle manages to get the photograph of the prince and sends it to Raj Matha. Prince Rajeshwar (Rajesh Khanna) had been kidnapped by Prem's mother in his childhood to prevent him inheriting the wealth of Raigadh palace and to make her son the heir for it.

Prem recognizes the identity of lost Prince Rajeshwar in Raju. So he insists upon Raju to act like him in the palace, but Raju refuses as he cannot serve several years of jail as his colony people need him. Prem sets fire to the colony and this angers Raju. So he sets off to the palace where, without any effort, gets accepted by the Queen as Prince Rajeshwar, in spite of his repeated denials. The Queen identifies him through his photograph, burnt hand (actually he got burnt in the fire set in the colony) and the finger print of the Prince. But the astrologer who is working for Prem lies to the Queen that he is the real prince, thinking Raju is the man sent by Prem. Raju was crowned as Prince Rajeshwar. The real prince is under custody of Prem's mother, who is still childlike, playing with toys and putting his thumb in his mouth like a toddler. Raju captures Prem, arrests him, and puts him in the palace prison. Thakur Singh, who wants to be the actual heir, finds that Prem is his own son. Prem reveals to his father that he is not the real prince, but is sent by him. Thakur Singh reveals this to all, but he is not believed by anybody as he has no proof for his statement. Raju is moved by the motherly love of the queen and so he wants to leave the palace, unwilling to deceive and disappoint her, but stays on the compulsion of Neetu as she insists that Raj Mata is smiling only on his arrival. Raju swears to stay and find out the real prince. Meanwhile, the Queen finds out the truth and asks him to get out, but is shot by Thakur Singh and blames Raju for the shooting. Raju is arrested, but he escapes. Prem plans to kill Raju when he comes to hospital to visit Rajmata. But Raju disguises himself as Dr. Muthuswamy, a man from Madras and donates the rare blood AB negative to the queen and saves her. Raju finds out the real Prince Rajeshwar, who is under the custody of Prem and rescues him. Prem, his mother and Thakur Singh are arrested. The Queen finally re-unites with her son. She also unites Neetu with Raju as Neetu actually loves him. Cast *Rajesh Khanna as Raju Khan / Rajeshwar A. Singh / Johnny Fernandes *Neetu Singh as Neetu *Prem Chopra as Prem D.

Managed by Franck Toutoundjian, A.S.A Issy (or A.S Ararat Issy) plays in the CFA 2 in 2009-10.  History  In 1974, a group of friends decided to create a football club for Armenian community of Ile-de- France. It was essentially a way of sharing their passion for sport with the youth of the community at the same time as transmitting some of the rich cultural heritage of Armenia, one of the oldest civilisations in the world. The Association Sportive Arménienne (A.S.A) decided to play in Issy-les- Moulineaux after the request of Armand Zarpanelian, former player who built the stadium in 1981. The club had around 60 players and played in the first Division in the District. At the start of the 1990s, A.S.A Issy had been promoted three years running, and played in the first Division of the District of the D.H (Division d'Honneur). The match to get promoted to the P.H (Promotion d'Honneur) is well remembered. 1200 people watched the 3-0 victory for A.S.A Issy against F.C Montrouge 92, an attendance record for this level of match. The team has not yet dropped back down to this level, but they have had difficult seasons in their history. It took a 2-0 victory against F.C Massy 91, to stay in the D.H (Division d'Honneur), with two extraordinary goals from Michel Milosevic, both player and general manager. To begin with, the club only used players of Armenian origin. A.S.A Issy became progressively more open, and tries to conserve and develop a community and familial spirit. Franck Toutoundjian, club president, is quoted as saying: \\"the community aspect has never been a fixation, but we are the only community club playing in the C.F.A 2\\". This is why, in 2003, the club changed its name from Association Sportive Arménienne, to Association Sportive d'Origine Arménienne, so that A.S.A Issy became A.S.O.A Issy. The club currently has around 400 members, with thirty coaches and fifteen technicians. The club also has twelve referees and two controllers represented on the board of the District of Hauts-de-Seine (92). At the end of the 2005/2006 season, the A.S.O.A Issy team finished in first place with the best attack, the best defence, and the two highest scorers in the league (Eric Akoun and Julien Potier). After 14 seasons in the D.H (Division d'Honneur), the team began the 2006/2007 season in C.F.A 2 and therefore represented the town of Issy-les-Moulineaux as well as the agglomeration of Arc de Seine (five towns with almost 165 000 inhabitants). A.S.O.A Issy is, in sporting terms, the major football club for the town of Issy-les-Moulineaux since F.C Issy-les-Moulineaux has a smaller number of members. It is fact the biggest sports club in the town of Issy-les- Moulineaux. At the start of the 2008/2009 season, the club changed its name for a second time, from Association Sportive d'Origine Arménienne, to Association Sportive Ararat, so that A.S.O.A Issy became A.S.A Issy (or A.S Ararat Issy). This is because, under the ownership of Franck Toutoundjian and Patrick Chêne, A.S.A Issy became associated with Groupe 365 (part of Groupe Sporever) under the control of sporting internet sites such as Football365.fr, to play an important role in the project of MyFootballClub. Due to the role of strong personalities, the team continues to grow: Armand Zarpanelian, the club's founder, Sarkis Kasparian, former president, Michel Milosevic, Jean- Pierre Ortz, Vincent Yazmadjian, youth coach, Franck Toutoundjian, the current president, and many others. The club have also been supported by André Santini, Mayor of Issy-les-Moulineaux, who has supported the club since its foundation.

The French raid was intended to boost morale, secure Louisbourg's supply lines with the surrounding Acadian settlements, and deprive Britain of a base from which to attack Louisbourg. There were 50 English families in the settlement.Joseph Emerson. Diary kept at the Siege of Louisburg. March 15-August 14, 1745. Cambridge: John Wilson and Son, 1910, pp. 10-11. While the settlement was utterly destroyed, the objective failed, since the British launched an attack on Louisbourg in 1745, using Canso as a staging area.  Background  The inhabitants of Louisbourg received word of France's declaration of war on Great Britain on May 3, 1744. The colony had been facing dwindling provisions, a situation which was aggravated when the news of war brought the threat of British action cutting off the supply lines of Louisbourg. Under these circumstances, the continuance of the colony's provisioning necessitated military action. Furthermore, orders from Maurepas, the French minister of the navy, instructed the governor of Île Royale to utilize the element of surprise and rapidly mobilize against the English. Within a week of the arrival of the news of war a military expedition to Canso was agreed upon, and on May 23 a flotilla left Louisbourg harbour. In this same month Captain David Donahue of the Resolution took prisoner the chief of the Mi'kmaq people of Ile Royale Jacques Pandanuques with his family to Boston and killed him. Donahue used the same strategy of posing as a French ship to entrap Chief Pandanuques as he does in the Naval battle off Tatamagouche, after which Donahue was tortured and killed by the Mi'kmaq.Pierre Malliard.MEMORIAL OF THE Motives of the Savages, called Mickmakis and Maricheets, for continuing the War with England since the last Peace. Donahue also took 8 Mi'kmaw prisoners from Canso on April 14.  Battle  John Bradstreet - captured by the French in the Raid The expedition of Mi'kmaq militia and Compagnies Franches de la Marine, led by Captain François Dupont Duvivier, arrived during the night of May 24, finding Canso weakly defended and unprepared for war. At dawn the French commenced bombardment of the town's only fortification, a timber blockhouse. The British commandant, Captain Patrick Heron and four companies of the 40th Regiment of Foot, realizing that he was out-manned and out-gunned swiftly capitulated, while Lieutenant George Rydall fought on with an armed sloop before surrendering a short time later after his force sustained several casualties. The terms of surrender were promptly worked out, and by mid-morning Canso was in French hands. After loading substantial quantities of loot onto their fleet the French put the town to the torch and weighed anchor. The garrison was taken to Louisbourg to be held as prisoners of war, while passage was arranged to Boston for the women and children.  Aftermath  Private, 40th Regiment of Foot, Nova Scotia, 1742 - defending Canso The success of the raid on Canso caused great excitement and celebration in Louisbourg, bolstering the morale of the French citizenry and their native allies, while depriving Britain of a strategic base in eastern Nova Scotia. However the task of maintaining more than one hundred prisoners taxed the colony's already strained food supply. Once the 40th regiment's officers and men were paroled in September 1744, the regiment was evacuated to Boston where they (particularly John Bradstreet) provided valuable information on the defences of Louisbourg for the British siege the following year.http://www.militaryheritage.com/40th.htm Governor Shirley was having difficulty raising troops requested by Mascarene and therefore he ordered the ex-Canso garrison to Annapolis Royal. The raid was followed by a siege of Annapolis Royal. The attacks alarmed the British colonists in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, many of whom believed the raid was a prelude to further attacks on Massachusetts. On October 20, 1744, Massachusetts officially declared war on the Mi'kmaq.Geoffrey Plank. An Unsettled Conquest, 2001. p. 110. In 1745 the province mounted a successful siege of Louisbourg.

The 34th Pursuit Squadron was assigned P-35A, the remainder of the P-35s being sent to the Philippines Air Corps. =Eve of war= Notice was received by the group on 15 November that due to the tense international situation between the United States and the Japanese Empire, all pursuit aircraft on the flight line would be placed on alert 24 hours each day, be armed, and be fully fueled with pilots available on 30 minutes' notice. During the period 30 November to 6 December all squadrons underwent intensive training in day and night enemy interception and air-to-air gunnery. Also training in escorting B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 19th Bombardment Group was undertaken. During the first days of December, on four consecutive nights (2d-6th) an unidentified aircraft was sighted over Clark Field at approximately 05:30. After the first sighting, instructions were given to force the aircraft to land or destroy it. On three succeeding nights it was impossible to make the interception, due to the inability to see the aircraft in the dark or the aircraft not getting close enough to be picked up by the ground searchlights. On the fifth morning all aircraft were kept on the ground and the anti-aircraft batteries were alerted for the interception; however the aircraft was not located. During this same period, many other undetermined aircraft were tracked by Iba Radar. On the night of 7 December 1941, the 24th Pursuit Group status was reported to Far East Air Force as follows: * 3rd Pursuit Squadron at Iba Field, 18 P-40Es in commission * 17th Pursuit Squadron at Nichols Field, 18 P-40Es in commission * 20th Pursuit Squadron at Clark Field, 18 P-40Es in commission * 21st Pursuit Squadron at Nichols Field, had 18 P-40Bs in commission * 34th Pursuit Squadron at Del Carmen Field had 18 P-35As in commission =8 December 1941= On 8 December at about 03:30 the commercial radio station at Clark Field intercepted a message from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii about the Japanese attack there. However the group was unable to verify this interception through official channels, no other action was taken other than notifying the Base Commander. However, all squadrons were put on alert. At about 04:00 the radar at Iba Field reported a formation of unidentified aircraft approximately 75 miles off the West Coast of Luzon heading towards Corregidor. The 3d Pursuit Squadron was dispatched to intercept the formation, but no planes were sighted and the squadron returned to Iba. However, the radar tracks showed the interception was successful and the unidentified aircraft swung off to the west out of the range of the Radar. It was believed that the 3d went underneath the formation. At 04:45 notification was received of a state of war between the United States and the Japanese Empire. 21st Pursuit Squadron Curtiss P-40B Warhawks Clark Field, Field, Luzon, 1941 At approximately 09:30, a large formation of Japanese bombers was spotted over Lingayen Gulf reported heading towards Manila. The 20th Pursuit Squadron was immediately dispatched to intercept the formation over Roselas. The 17th Pursuit Squadron was ordered from Nichols Field to cover the airspace over Clark. Again, the interception was not successful, as the bombers turned to the northeast and attacked Baguio and Tuguegarao then headed north off the radar. Both squadrons returned to their stations and were refueled and put back on alert.The Army Air Forces in World War II, Chapter 6, Pearl Harbor and Clark Field Again at approximately 11:30 a large formation of bombers was reported over the China Sea heading towards Manila. The 3d was again dispatched to intercept; the 17th was dispatched to cover Bataan and the 34th was placed on a standing patrol over Manila. Uncertainties of time and place, however, made it doubtful if the 3d would accomplish the interception. At 11:45 an unverified report was received of another bomber formation over Lingayen Gulf, heading south. The 20th was still being refueled and was unable to take off, so the 21st was ordered to cover Clark Field. At 12:15 the 20th completed refueling and was also ordered to cover Clark, At 12:20 54 Japanese bombers and an undetermined number of naval dive bombers attacked Clark Field. The 20th was in the process of taking off when the attack came. Only 4 squadron aircraft had cleared the runway, another five were destroyed on the ground while taking off. The remaining 5 planes were destroyed by a strafing attack after the bombardment. At the time of the attack on Clark Field, four squadrons of pursuit planes were in the air, but a complete breakdown of communications occurred when the communications center at Clark was destroyed by a bomb and little more than a dozen American aircraft met the Japanese attackers, none of which could climb to the altitude of the bombers As a result, the 17th and 21st planes over Manila were not notified of the attack. The P-35s at Del Carmen Field took to the air after seeing the clouds of smoke over Clark Field, but were no match for the Japanese Zeros, which were much faster and more maneuverable. Although none were shot down, all were damaged and its use as a pursuit fighter ended. Clark Field, the main air base on Luzon was devastated, and nearly half of Far East Air Force's aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and a third of the 24th Pursuit Group's aircraft lost in the attack. Clark Field was so heavily damaged it was essentially eliminated as an effective combat airfield. The 3d Pursuit Squadron, which was dispatched to intercept a formation of planes over the China Sea failed to make the interception and was returning to its base at Iba. Iba, however was plotting an incoming formation and was transmitting the information to the Air Warning Center at Nielson Field. However, due to a communications breakdown the 3d was unaware of the incoming formation and as they were circling Iba Field on their landing approach, 54 Japanese bombers and an unknown number of Naval dive bombers approached the field. The 3d broke the landing formation and attacked the incoming enemy aircraft. In the ensuing battle, one enemy bomber was shot down and a number of strafing aircraft were claimed to have been destroyed. The 3d lost five P-40s in the air. Although the 3d was unable to prevent to bombing of Iba Field, it did prevent the strafing of the ground station. After the Japanese raid, three additional P-40s were forced to crash land on the beaches after running out of fuel. The remainder of the squadron landed at the O'Donnell airport, but were forced to remain there until ammunition and gasoline were dispatched from Clark Field. Iba Field and three additional planes on the ground in Iba hangars for maintenance were completely destroyed by the enemy bombardment. =December 1941= Lt. Lloyd Stinson, 34th Pursuit Squadron Seversky P-35A in combat over the Philippines, 1941. On 9 December shortly after midnight, telephonic communications were re- established with Headquarters, FEAF. Intelligence reported that an unidentified number of enemy aircraft were approaching from the north. A flight of six P-40s from the 17th Pursuit Squadron was dispatched from Del Carmen to intercept. However two of the aircraft were demolished on takeoff due to an accident. The remaining planes proceeded to Nichols Field but were unable to accomplish any interception of enemy aircraft in the dark. For the remainder of the day, the only activity was miscellaneous elements of Japanese ships patrolling and aircraft reconnoitering, and the night bombing of Nichols Field at 03:15. In order to try and bring some of the units up to strength, the P-40s of the 17th were transferred to Clark Field along with some P-40s from the 3d Pursuit Squadron which were moved from Iba Field. The remainder of the 3d was sent to Nichols Field to bring the 34th with its P-35s up to strength. On the night of the 10th, a Japanese invasion convoy was reported approaching Lingayen Bay. The 17th and 34th Pursuit Squadrons were readied to attack the convoy at daylight and furnish cover for some B-17s that were repaired and put back on the line at Clark to join in the attack. The B-17s took off with the 17th providing top cover during the attack. P-35s from the 34th failed to reach the objective due to their low speed, and only at the end of the attack did the 34th proceed to attack the convoy. Two P-35s were lost, one when the plane flew into a large explosion on a ship the aircraft attacked as the pilot was passing over it. After the attack, both squadrons returned for re-fueling and re-arming and went back on alert. Later that morning at 11:15 a warning was received of large formations of Japanese aircraft approaching from the north. The 17th was dispatched to intercept the planes over Manila Bay, the 34th was sent over Manila to cover the port area. The 21st was sent for interception over the Bataan Peninsula. Contact was made with the enemy aircraft by all three squadrons, an estimated 100+ Japanese aircraft with fighters escorting the bombers. The interceptors of the 24th were attacked by the escort Zeros and were unable to attack the bombers due to the large number of enemy fighter strength. Only two planes were able to attack the bombers, after they carried out their attacks. The other squadrons engaged in dog-fighting over Manila Bay until they were forced to land, out of gasoline. At the end of the 10th, Group fighter strength had been reduced to about 30 aircraft, with 8 being P-35s. Due to the depleted strength of the Group, orders were received from FEAF Headquarters that pursuit planes were not to be dispatched other than upon orders from Headquarters. The planes would be employed mainly as reconnaissance aircraft to replace the 2d Observation Squadron, which was made inoperable after being mostly destroyed on the ground. Its remaining planes were unarmed and sitting ducks if attacked. 21st Pursuit Squadron P-40Bs being serviced at Clark Field, Luzon. In the days that followed, the 24th flew patrol and reconnaissance missions in various areas. The 3d and 34th squadrons were combined to cover the southern part of Luzon. The 17th and 20th were used to cover the northern part of the Island. The 21st was non-operational. However, occasional attacks were made in the course of these reconnaissance missions. Lt. Wagner, while performing a reconnaissance mission over Aparri, strafed the captured airport there and shot down four enemy aircraft in the area. The strafing also destroyed a number of aircraft on the ground. Lt Mahoney, on a reconnaissance mission over Legaspi, strafed the airport there and destroyed several enemy aircraft on the ground. He also destroyed the enemy radio station as well as a fuel dump. With no supplies or replacements available from the United States, ground crews, with little or no spares for repairing aircraft, used parts which were cannibalized from wrecks. Essentials, such as oil, was reused, with used oil being strained though makeshift filters, and tailwheel tires were stuffed with rags to keep them usable. The aircraft which were flying and engaging the Japanese seemed to have more bullethole patches on the fuselage than original skin.Edmonds, Walter D. They Fought With What They Had: The Story of the Army Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific, 1941–1942 (1951, 1982) On the morning of 23 December the Japanese made a landing in San Miguel Bay along the east coast of the Lingayen Gulf. All available aircraft of the 24th were loaded with fragmentation bombs and dispatched to attack the enemy landing. Twelve P-40s and six P-35s was the entire striking force of the Group. The attack was made with a loss of two of the P-35s which were shot down by anti-aircraft fire and it proved sufficient to create confusion among enemy personnel in landing barges and around supply dumps ashore. =Spring 1942= : for additional information, see: Bataan Airfield Captured Japanese photo of a 34th Pursuit Squadron P-35A sized at Orani Airfield by Japanese Forces, 1942 The ground combat situation on Luzon quickly became desperate when a second set of major landings occurred along the shore of Lamon Bay in southern Luzon. With the withdrawal from Clark Field on 20 December, the 24th used dispersed landing fields on Luzon, some little more than grass to carry on the fight. Japanese forces were rapidly advancing from both the north and south. MacArthur ordered all American and Philippine forces to withdraw to the Bataan Peninsula and all FEAF aircraft to withdraw from Clark and Nichols Fields. Field order No. 4, HQ Philippines Department on 10 January 1942 appointed the ground echelons of the 24th Pursuit Group as the 2d Infantry Regiment (Provisional) of the 71st Division. The unit was ordered to establish defenses on the beach of the peninsula. AFHRA Document 00078307 24th Pursuit Group * The ground echelon of the 3d Pursuit Squadron was moved from Nichols Field to Organi, then to the mouth of the Talan River where the men took up a position as ground troops on beach defense. * The ground echelon of the 20th Pursuit Squadron, was moved to Pilar, and from there to the Mariveles cut-off on the Tanikan River, where they assumed the role of regimental reserves. * The ground echelon of the 17th Pursuit Squadron was moved from Nichols Field and Manila to Pilar and from there to Kabobo point where the took up beach defenses. * The ground echelon of the 21st Pursuit Squadron moved from Lububo to KM Post 184 where they went into position as regimental reserve. * The ground echelon of the 34th Pursuit Squadron was moved from Del Carmen Field to Orani, and from there to Aglaloma Point where it went into position on beach defense. What was left of the group were based at temporary fields at Orani and Pilar in northern Bataan, and later withdrawn on 8 January to \\"Bataan Field,\\" located several miles from the southern tip of the peninsula. Bataan field consisted of a dirt runway, hacked out of the jungle by Army engineers in early 1941 and lengthened after the FEAF was ordered into Bataan. However, it was well camouflaged. It was attacked and strafed daily by the Japanese, however no aircraft were lost on the ground as a result of the attacks. Bataan Field, along with airfields at Cabcaben and Mariveles were kept in operation for several months during the Battle of Bataan. The remaining pilots continued operations with the few planes that were left, cannibalizing aircraft wreckage to keep a few planes airborne in the early months of 1942. =After Bataan= With the surrender of the United States Army on Bataan, Philippines on 8 April 1942, the remaining air echelon of the 24th Pursuit Group withdrew to Mindanao Island and began operating from Del Monte Airfield with whatever aircraft were remaining. The last of the group's aircraft were captured or destroyed by enemy forces on or about 1 May 1942. With the collapse of organized United States resistance in the Philippines on 8 May 1942, a few surviving members of the squadron managed to escape from Mindanao to Australia where they were integrated into existing units. The 24th Pursuit Group and its squadrons were never remanned after the battle. They were simply left on the active list of Fifth Air Force organizations throughout the war. The unit and its subordinate squadrons were inactivated on 2 April 1946. Over the years, the 3d, 20th and 17th Squadrons were re-activated by the United States Air Force and currently are on active duty, but the 21st and 34th Squadrons have remained inactive. =Lineage= * Constituted as 24th Pursuit Group (Interceptor) on 16 August 1941 : Activated on 1 October 1941 : Inactivated on 2 April 1946 * Redesignated 324th Tactical Fighter Wing on 31 January 1985Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 648q, 31 July 1985, Subject: Reconstitution, Redesignation, and Consolidation of Selected Air Force Organizations (not active) =Assignments= * Philippine Department Air Force 16 August 1941 : Redesignated: Far East Air Force on 28 October 1941 : Resesignated: 5th Air Force on 5 February 1942 : Redesignated: Fifth Air Force on 18 September 1942 – 2 April 1946 =Stations and components= * Headquarters and Ground Echelon: : Clark Field, Luzon, 1 October 1941 : Mariveles, Bataan, Luzon, c. 1 January – May 1942 : Attached to Fifth Air Force Headquarters after 1 May 1942 until inactivation * 3d Pursuit Squadron: 1 October 1941 – 2 April 1946 : Squadron operated from: Iba Airfield, Luzon, 1 September 1941 : Squadron operated from: Nichols Field, Luzon, 9 December 1941 : Squadron operated from: Ternate Field, Luzon, 12 December 1941 : Squadron operated from: Del Carmen Field**, Luzon, 25 December 1941 * 17th Pursuit Squadron: 1 October 1941 – 2 April 1946 : Squadron operated from: Nichols Field, Luzon, 5 December 1941 : Squadron operated from: Clark Field, Luzon, 9–25 December 1941 : Squadron operated from: Pilar Airfield**, Luzon, 26 December 1941 – 8 January 1942 * 20th Pursuit Squadron: 1 October 1941 – 2 April 1946 : Squadron operated from: Clark Field**, Luzon, 1 October 1941 * 21st Pursuit Squadron: 1 October 1941 – 2 April 1946 (Attached.

There were a total of 107 Curtiss P-40s that were assigned to the 24th Pursuit Group, most being received after the transition from the 4th Composite Group. They were a mix of P-40Bs and P-40Es, mostly Es. Also, there were several P-40E-1s that were shipped to the Philippines that were still in crates at the Manila Air Depot on 8 December 1941. It is unknown whether or not these saw service against the Japanese.

Breathing (or ventilation) is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs to facilitate gas exchange with the internal environment, mostly by bringing in oxygen and flushing out carbon dioxide. All aerobic creatures need oxygen for cellular respiration, which uses the oxygen to break down foods for energy and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. Breathing, or \\"external respiration\\", brings air into the lungs where gas exchange takes place in the alveoli through diffusion. The body's circulatory system transports these gases to and from the cells, where \\"cellular respiration\\" takes place. The breathing of all vertebrates with lungs consists of repetitive cycles of inhalation and exhalation through a highly branched system of tubes or airways which lead from the nose to the alveoli. The number of respiratory cycles per minute is the breathing or respiratory rate, and is one of the four primary vital signs of life. Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood constant. Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to tight control of the pH of the extracellular fluids (ECF). Over-breathing (hyperventilation) and under-breathing (hypoventilation), which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively, cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case, and a lowering of the pH in the second. Both cause distressing symptoms. Breathing has other important functions. It provides a mechanism for speech, laughter and similar expressions of the emotions. It is also used for reflexes such as yawning, coughing and sneezing. Animals that cannot thermoregulate by perspiration, because they lack sufficient sweat glands, may lose heat by evaporation through panting. Mechanics The lungs are not capable of inflating themselves, and will expand only when there is an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. In humans, as in the other mammals, this is achieved primarily through the contraction of the diaphragm, but also by the contraction of the intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards and outwards as shown in the diagrams on the left. During forceful inhalation (Figure on the right) the accessory muscles of inhalation, which connect the ribs and sternum to the cervical vertebrae and base of the skull, in many cases through an intermediary attachment to the clavicles, exaggerate the pump handle and bucket handle movements (see illustrations on the left), bringing about a greater change in the volume of the chest cavity. During exhalation (breathing out), at rest, all the muscles of inhalation relax, returning the chest and abdomen to a position called the “resting position”, which is determined by their anatomical elasticity. At this point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5–3.0 liters. During heavy breathing (hyperpnea) as, for instance, during exercise, exhalation is brought about by relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation, (in the same way as at rest), but, in addition, the abdominal muscles, instead of being passive, now contract strongly causing the rib cage to be pulled downwards (front and sides). This not only decreases the size of the rib cage but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax. The end-exhalatory lung volume is now less air than the resting \\"functional residual capacity\\". However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human, there is always still at least one liter of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation. Diaphragmatic breathing causes the abdomen to rhythmically bulge out and fall back. It is, therefore, often referred to as \\"abdominal breathing\\". These terms are often used interchangeably because they describe the same action. When the accessory muscles of inhalation are activated, especially during labored breathing, the clavicles are pulled upwards, as explained above. This external manifestation of the use of the accessory muscles of inhalation is sometimes referred to as clavicular breathing, seen especially during asthma attacks and in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Passage of air This is a diagram showing how inhalation and exhalation is controlled by a variety of muscles, and what that looks like from a general overall view. =Upper airways= The lower airways. Inhaled air is warmed and moistened by the wet, warm nasal mucosa, which consequently cools and dries. When warm, wet air from the lungs is breathed out through the nose, the cold hygroscopic mucus in the cool and dry nose re-captures some of the warmth and moisture from that exhaled air. In very cold weather the re-captured water may cause a \\"dripping nose\\". Following on from the above diagram, if the exhaled air is breathed out through the mouth on a cold and humid conditions, the water vapor will condense into a visible cloud or mist. Usually, air is breathed in and out through the nose. The nasal cavities (between the nostrils and the pharynx) are quite narrow, firstly by being divided in two by the nasal septum, and secondly by lateral walls that have several longitudinal folds, or shelves, called nasal conchae, thus exposing a large area of nasal mucous membrane to the air as it is inhaled (and exhaled). This causes the inhaled air to take up moisture from the wet mucus, and warmth from the underlying blood vessels, so that the air is very nearly saturated with water vapor and is at almost body temperature by the time it reaches the larynx. Part of this moisture and heat is recaptured as the exhaled air moves out over the partially dried-out, cooled mucus in the nasal passages, during breathing out. The sticky mucus also traps much of the particulate matter that is breathed in, preventing it from reaching the lungs. =Lower airways= The anatomy of a typical mammalian respiratory system, below the structures normally listed among the \\"upper airways\\" (the nasal cavities, the pharynx, and larynx), is often described as a respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree (figure on the left). Larger airways give rise to branches that are slightly narrower, but more numerous than the \\"trunk\\" airway that gives rise to the branches. The human respiratory tree may consist of, on average, 23 such branchings into progressively smaller airways, while the respiratory tree of the mouse has up to 13 such branchings. Proximal divisions (those closest to the top of the tree, such as the trachea and bronchi) function mainly to transmit air to the lower airways. Later divisions such as the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli are specialized for gas exchange. The trachea and the first portions of the main bronchi are outside the lungs. The rest of the \\"tree\\" branches within the lungs, and ultimately extends to every part of the lungs. The alveoli are the blind-ended terminals of the \\"tree\\", meaning that any air that enters them has to exit via the same route it used to enter the alveoli. A system such as this creates dead space, a volume of air that fills the airways (the dead space) at the end of inhalation, and is breathed out, unchanged, during the next exhalation, never having reached the alveoli. Similarly, the dead space is filled with alveolar air at the end of exhalation, and is the first air to breathed back into the alveoli, before any fresh air reaches the alveoli during inhalation. The dead space volume of a typical adult human is about 150 ml. Gas exchange The primary purpose of breathing is to refresh air in the alveoli so that gas exchange can take place in the blood. The equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the alveolar blood and the alveolar air occurs by diffusion. After exhaling, adult human lungs still contain 2.5–3 L of air, their functional residual capacity or FRC. On inhalation, only about 350 mL of new, warm, moistened atmospheric air is brought in and is well mixed with the FRC. Consequently, the gas composition of the FRC changes very little during the breathing cycle. This means that the pulmonary, capillary blood always equilibrates with a relatively constant air composition in the lungs and the diffusion rate with arterial blood gases remains equally constant with each breath. Body tissues are therefore not exposed to large swings in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in the blood caused by the breathing cycle, and the peripheral and central chemoreceptors measure only gradual changes in dissolved gases. Thus the homeostatic control of the breathing rate depends only on the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, which then also maintains a constant pH of the blood. Control The rate and depth of breathing is automatically controlled by the respiratory centers that receive information from the peripheral and central chemoreceptors. These chemoreceptors continuously monitor the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood. The sensors are, firstly, the central chemoreceptors on the surface of the medulla oblongata of the brain stem which are particularly sensitive to pH as well as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The second group of sensors measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. Together the latter is known as the peripheral chemoreceptors which are situated in the aortic and carotid bodies. Information from all of these chemoreceptors is conveyed to the respiratory centers in the pons and medulla oblongata, which responds to deviations in the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood from normal by adjusting the rate and depth of breathing, in such a way as to restore partial pressure of carbon dioxide back to 5.3 kPa (40 mm Hg), the pH to 7.4 and, to a lesser extent, the partial pressure of oxygen to 13 kPa (100 mm Hg). For instance, exercise increases the production of carbon dioxide by the active muscles. This carbon dioxide diffuses into the venous blood and ultimately raises the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This is immediately sensed by the carbon dioxide chemoreceptors on the brain stem. The respiratory centers respond to this information by causing the rate and depth of breathing to increase to such an extent that the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood return almost immediately to the same levels as at rest. The respiratory centers communicate with the muscles of breathing via motor nerves, of which the phrenic nerves, which innervate the diaphragm, are probably the most important. Automatic breathing can be overridden to a limited extent by simple choice, or to facilitate swimming, speech, singing or other vocal training. It is impossible to suppress the urge to breathe to the point of hypoxia but training can increase the ability to breath-hold. Other automatic breathing control reflexes also exist. Submersion, particularly of the face, in cold water, triggers a response called the diving reflex. This firstly has the result of shutting down the airways against the influx of water. The metabolic rate slows right down. This is coupled with intense vasoconstriction of the arteries to the limbs and abdominal viscera. This reserves the oxygen that is in blood and lungs at the beginning of the dive almost exclusively for the heart and the brain. The diving reflex is an often- used response in animals that routinely need to dive, such as penguins, seals and whales. It is also more effective in very young infants and children than in adults. Composition Inhaled air is by volume 79% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen and small amounts of other gases including argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium, and hydrogen. The gas exhaled is 4% to 5% by volume of carbon dioxide, about a 100 fold increase over the inhaled amount. The volume of oxygen is reduced by a small amount, 4% to 5%, compared to the oxygen inhaled. The typical composition is: *5.0–6.3% water vapor *79% nitrogen https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z6h4jxs/revision/3 *13.6–16.0% oxygen *4.0–5.3% carbon dioxide *1% argon * parts per million (ppm) of hydrogen, from the metabolic activity of microorganisms in the large intestine. *ppm of carbon monoxide from degradation of heme proteins. *1 ppm of ammonia. * Trace many hundreds of volatile organic compounds especially isoprene and acetone. The presence of certain organic compounds indicate disease. In addition to air, underwater divers practicing technical diving may breathe oxygen-rich, oxygen-depleted or helium-rich breathing gas mixtures. Oxygen and analgesic gases are sometimes given to patients under medical care. The atmosphere in space suits is pure oxygen. However, this is kept at around 20% of Earthbound atmospheric pressure to regulate the rate of inspiration. Effects of ambient air pressureBreathing at altitude= Fig. 4 Atmospheric pressure Atmospheric pressure decreases with the height above sea level (altitude) and since the alveoli are open to the outside air through the open airways, the pressure in the lungs also decreases at the same rate with altitude. At altitude, a pressure differential is still required to drive air into and out of the lungs as it is at sea level. The mechanism for breathing at altitude is essentially identical to breathing at sea level but with the following differences: The atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude, roughly halving with every rise in altitude. The composition of atmospheric air is, however, almost constant below 80 km, as a result of the continuous mixing effect of the weather. The concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O2 per liter of air) therefore decreases at the same rate as the atmospheric pressure. At sea level, where the ambient pressure is about 100 kPa, oxygen contributes 21% of the atmosphere and the partial pressure of oxygen () is 21 kPa (i.e. 21% of 100 kPa). At the summit of Mount Everest, , where the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7 kPa, oxygen still contributes 21% of the atmosphere but its partial pressure is only 7.1 kPa (i.e. 21% of 33.7 kPa = 7.1 kPa). Therefore, a greater volume of air must be inhaled at altitude than at sea level in order to breathe in the same amount of oxygen in a given period. During inhalation, air is warmed and saturated with water vapor as it passes through the nose and pharynx before it enters the alveoli. The saturated vapor pressure of water is dependent only on temperature; at a body core temperature of 37 °C it is 6.3 kPa (47.0 mmHg), regardless of any other influences, including altitude. Consequently, at sea level, the tracheal air (immediately before the inhaled air enters the alveoli) consists of: water vapor ( = 6.3 kPa), nitrogen ( = 74.0 kPa), oxygen ( = 19.7 kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases, a total of 100 kPa. In dry air, the at sea level is 21.0 kPa, compared to a of 19.7 kPa in the tracheal air (21% of [100 – 6.3] = 19.7 kPa). At the summit of Mount Everest tracheal air has a total pressure of 33.7 kPa, of which 6.3 kPa is water vapor, reducing the in the tracheal air to 5.8 kPa (21% of [33.7 – 6.3] = 5.8 kPa), beyond what is accounted for by a reduction of atmospheric pressure alone (7.1 kPa). The pressure gradient forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is also reduced by altitude. Doubling the volume of the lungs halves the pressure in the lungs at any altitude. Having the sea level air pressure (100 kPa) results in a pressure gradient of 50 kPa but doing the same at 5500 m, where the atmospheric pressure is 50 kPa, a doubling of the volume of the lungs results in a pressure gradient of the only 25 kPa. In practice, because we breathe in a gentle, cyclical manner that generates pressure gradients of only 2–3 kPa, this has little effect on the actual rate of inflow into the lungs and is easily compensated for by breathing slightly deeper. The lower viscosity of air at altitude allows air to flow more easily and this also helps compensate for any loss of pressure gradient. All of the above effects of low atmospheric pressure on breathing are normally accommodated by increasing the respiratory minute volume (the volume of air breathed in — or out — per minute), and the mechanism for doing this is automatic. The exact increase required is determined by the respiratory gases homeostatic mechanism, which regulates the arterial and . This homeostatic mechanism prioritizes the regulation of the arterial over that of oxygen at sea level. That is to say, at sea level the arterial is maintained at very close to 5.3 kPa (or 40 mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial , which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response. However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the atmospheric ) falls to below 75% of its value at sea level, oxygen homeostasis is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis. This switch- over occurs at an elevation of about . If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperventilation at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial with a consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma leading to respiratory alkalosis. This is one contributor to high altitude sickness. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then hypoxia may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results. =Breathing at depth= Typical breathing effort when breathing through a diving regulator Pressure increases with the depth of water at the rate of about one atmosphere — slightly more than 100 kPa, or one bar, for every 10 meters. Air breathed underwater by divers is at the ambient pressure of the surrounding water and this has a complex range of physiological and biochemical implications. If not properly managed, breathing compressed gasses underwater may lead to several diving disorders which include pulmonary barotrauma, decompression sickness, nitrogen narcosis, and oxygen toxicity. The effects of breathing gasses under pressure are further complicated by the use of one or more special gas mixtures. Air is provided by a diving regulator, which reduces the high pressure in a diving cylinder to the ambient pressure. The breathing performance of regulators is a factor when choosing a suitable regulator for the type of diving to be undertaken. It is desirable that breathing from a regulator requires low effort even when supplying large amounts of air. It is also recommended that it supplies air smoothly without any sudden changes in resistance while inhaling or exhaling. In the graph, right, note the initial spike in pressure on exhaling to open the exhaust valve and that the initial drop in pressure on inhaling is soon overcome as the Venturi effect designed into the regulator to allow an easy draw of air. Many regulators have an adjustment to change the ease of inhaling so that breathing is effortless. Respiratory disorders Abnormal breathing patterns include Kussmaul breathing, Biot's respiration and Cheyne–Stokes respiration. Other breathing disorders include shortness of breath (dyspnea), stridor, apnea, sleep apnea (most commonly obstructive sleep apnea), mouth breathing, and snoring. Many conditions are associated with obstructed airways. Hypopnea refers to overly shallow breathing; hyperpnea refers to fast and deep breathing brought on by a demand for more oxygen, as for example by exercise. The terms hypoventilation and hyperventilation also refer to shallow breathing and fast and deep breathing respectively, but under inappropriate circumstances or disease. However, this distinction (between, for instance, hyperpnea and hyperventilation) is not always adhered to, so that these terms are frequently used interchangeably. A range of breath tests can be used to diagnose diseases such as dietary intolerances. A rhinomanometer uses acoustic technology to examine the air flow through the nasal passages. Society and culture The word \\"spirit\\" comes from the Latin spiritus, meaning breath. Historically, breath has often been considered in terms of the concept of life force. The Hebrew Bible refers to God breathing the breath of life into clay to make Adam a living soul (nephesh). It also refers to the breath as returning to God when a mortal dies. The terms spirit, prana, the Polynesian mana, the Hebrew ruach and the psyche in psychology are related to the concept of breath.psych-, psycho-, -psyche, -psychic, -psychical, -psychically + (Greek: mind, spirit, consciousness; mental processes; the human soul; breath of life) In T'ai chi, aerobic exercise is combined with breathing exercises to strengthen the diaphragm muscles, improve posture and make better use of the body's Qi, (energy). Different forms of meditation, and yoga advocate various breathing methods. A form of Buddhist meditation called anapanasati meaning mindfulness of breath was first introduced by Buddha. Breathing disciplines are incorporated into meditation, certain forms of yoga such as pranayama, and the Buteyko method as a treatment for asthma and other conditions. In music, some wind instrument players use a technique called circular breathing. Singers also rely on breath control. Common cultural expressions related to breathing include: \\"to catch my breath\\", \\"took my breath away\\", \\"inspiration\\", \\"to expire\\", \\"get my breath back\\". =Breathing and mood= Certain breathing patterns have a tendency to occur with certain moods. Due to this relationship, practitioners of various disciplines consider that they can encourage the occurrence of a particular mood by adopting the breathing pattern that it most commonly occurs in conjunction with. For instance, and perhaps the most common recommendation is that deeper breathing which utilizes the diaphragm and abdomen more can encourage a more relaxed and confident mood. Practitioners of different disciplines often interpret the importance of breathing regulation and its perceived influence on mood in different ways. Buddhists may consider that it helps precipitate a sense of inner-peace, holistic healers that it encourages an overall state of health and business advisers that it provides relief from work-based stress. =Breathing and physical exercise= During physical exercise, a deeper breathing pattern is adapted to facilitate greater oxygen absorption. An additional reason for the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern is to strengthen the body's core. During the process of deep breathing, the thoracic diaphragm adopts a lower position in the core and this helps to generate intra-abdominal pressure which strengthens the lumbar spine. Typically, this allows for more powerful physical movements to be performed. As such, it is frequently recommended when lifting heavy weights to take a deep breath or adopt a deeper breathing pattern.

He is best remembered as National Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party of America from 1916 to 1919. It was during this period that the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party emerged as an organized faction. Germer was instrumental as one of the leaders of the SPA's \\"Regular\\" faction in orchestrating a series of suspensions, expulsions, and \\"reorganizations\\" of various Left Wing states, branches, and locals and thereby controlling the pivotal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the SPA, and thus forcing the Left Wing to establish new organizations of their own, the Communist Labor Party of America and the Communist Party of America. BiographyEarly years= Adolph F. Germer was born January 15, 1881, in Welan, East Prussia, Germany the son of a miner.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 84. Germer emigrated to the United States with his family in December 1888 and attended public school in Braceville, Illinois. He also attended a Lutheran parochial school and completed his high school coursework via correspondence school. Germer also did course work at LaSalle Extension University. Germer went to work in the mines like his father at a very early age, first working as a trapper at a coal mine near Staunton, Illinois, at age 11. He was a member of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) from 1894. Germer escaped a life in the mines by working as a union official. He was elected Secretary of UMWA Local 728 in 1906 and its state legislative committeeman in 1907. That same year he was elected a sub-district vice president of the union. The next year he was elected secretary-treasurer of the sub-district of the UMWA, a position which he retained until 1912. That final year he was also elected representative of the United Mine Workers to the World Miners' Congress in Amsterdam. =Political career= Germer in his office as Executive Secretary of the SPA, 1916. Germer joined the Social Democratic Party of America, forerunner of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1900. In 1912 Germer was a candidate of the Socialist Party of Illinois for the Illinois legislature. In 1913, Germer was elected to the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party. At that same time, he worked as an organizer for the UMWA. In December of that year, Germer was arrested while getting off a train at Walsenburg, Colorado, the site of an ongoing mine strike. Germer was held incommunicado in the local jail for nearly a week in solitary confinement and his papers searched. HIs wife, Mabel Germer, was also briefly arrested.\\"Germer in Jail,\\" The Party Builder, whole no. 59 (December 20, 1913), pg. 1. Upon his release, Germer continued to work as a UMWA organizer in the bitterly fought Colorado coal strike. In 1914 Germer was elected Vice President of the Illinois Mine Workers, the state affiliate of the UMWA. He also ran for United States Senate from Illinois as a Socialist in the fall of that year. From 1916 through 1919, Germer served as National Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party of America, being twice elected by referendum votes of the party membership. His 1916 victory over Carl D. Thompson was made possible by staunch support from the SPA's language federations, many branches of which voted for Germer en bloc, enabling him to defeat the more conservative Thompson. A staunch antimilitarist and unflinching adherent of the party's anti-World War policies established at its 1917 Emergency National Convention held in St. Louis, Germer was indicted in Chicago by a grand jury under the Espionage Act on Feb. 2, 1918. This secret indictment was made public on March 9 and a trial of Germer and 4 other top members of the Socialist Party began before Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis on Dec. 6, 1918. The trial ended Jan. 4, 1919, and on the 9th day of that same month the jury found Germer and his associates (Victor L. Berger, J. Louis Engdahl, Irwin St. John Tucker, and William F. Kruse) guilty. Landis sentenced each to 20 years in the Federal penitentiary, a sentence which was appealed and later overturned on the basis of judicial bias. Germer was freed on $25,000 bail pending appeal, a sum put up by a man who was soon to be a political nemesis, the millionaire left wing socialist William Bross Lloyd. Germer was instrumental in guiding the National Executive Committee in 1919, a group which invalidated the party elections of that year on charges of electoral fraud, and which suspended a number of language federations and reorganized state organizations for purported violations of the SPA's national constitution. It was Germer who organized a caucus of loyal SPA Regulars prior to the opening of the convention on Aug. 30, 1919, and Germer who gaveled that gathering open. After the bitter 1919 convention, Germer resigned his post as Executive Secretary of the SPA and was replaced by his friend Otto Branstetter. Germer continued to draw a salary from the SPA, working as a National Organizer for the party from October 1919 through 1920. In that year he left the nearly bankrupt national party to work for the relatively more prosperous Local New York as an organizer, a position which he retained through 1922. Germer was also Assistant Secretary of Local New York, working under his friend and ally Julius Gerber from August 1921. In November 1921, Germer stood as a Socialist candidate for the New York State Assembly in the 16th A.D. After the 1921 election, Germer moved to Massachusetts, where he served as State Secretary of the Socialist Party of Massachusetts, starting in December.\\"Adolph Germer Papers, 1898-1966: Biography/History,\\" Wisconsin Historical Society, Madison. He remained in that position until some time the next year. =Return to union organizing= Thereafter, he left the employment of the Socialist Party, obtaining a job as a worker in the oil industry in California in 1923, where he was a member of the Oil Field, Gas Well and Refinery Workers Union. He later worked as an organizer for that union. Germer was active in the 1924 Presidential campaign of Robert M. La Follette. In 1926, Germer returned to Chicago, where he worked for a large real estate firm, remaining in that occupation until the onset of the depression in 1930. In 1930, Germer was elected a vice president of the reorganized United Mine Workers of America. The following year, he returned to his hometown of Mt. Olive, Illinois and went to work again as a miner until the mine was closed due to the economic downturn. In June 1931, Germer took a position as editor of the Rockford Labor News, remaining in that role until the end of 1933. In November 1935, Germer was appointed by John L. Lewis as the first field representative for the Congress of Industrial Organizations. It this capacity, Germer was a participant in the organizing campaigns and strike activities of the auto and rubber workers of the upper Midwest. Germer was particularly important as a key organizer in the 1937 United Auto Workers strike against General Motors. Germer officially retired from the AFL-CIO on April 1, 1955, but he continued to serve the organization on special assignments. =Death and legacy= After retirement, Germer moved back home to Illinois, dying in Rockford, IL in May 1966. The main part of Germer's papers are held by the State Historical Society of Wisconsin located at Madison and are available on microfilm. Another smaller assortment, relating to his activity from 1945 to 1947 with the World Federation of Trade Unions, reposes at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. An oral history interview was conducted with Germer on his experience as a United Auto Workers organizer in 1959. That material rests at the Reuther Library of Wayne State University, located in Detroit, Michigan.

It is double-tracked and electrified throughout.  History  It was the Bavarian state that first wanted to establish a main line from Regensburg to Passau and initiated plans accordingly, but for financial reasons its actual construction was given to a private company. The Bavarian Eastern Railway Company or Bayerische Ostbahn opened the first section from Regensburg to Sünching on 12 December 1859. From Sünching the line swung away to Geiselhöring in the valley of the Kleinen Laaber, where trains continued on to Landshut and Munich. Trains to Passau had to change direction before they could continue to Straubing. After 20 September 1860 the route, getting ever closer to the Danube, continued from Straubing via Plattling and Vilshofen as far as the border city of Passau. On 1 September 1861 the railway line was finally connected to the Austrian Empress Elisabeth Railway with its access to Linz and Vienna. On 1 July 1873 a direct route from Sünching to Straubing was opened, which considerably shortened the distance travelled. Similarly, from 6 August 1873, trains from Munich to Landshut could take a shorter route via Eggmühl and Neufahrn, which branched off the old line at Obertraubling. Between 1880 and 1897 the now superfluous section from Sünching to Geiselhöring was closed and later the one from Perkam to Straubing, after the link from Perkam to Radldorf was built on 30 September 1896, which formed a junction with the main line. The entire route came under the control of the Royal Bavarian State Railways on 10 May 1875 when the Ostbahn was transferred into state ownership. left  Operations  Today = Since the timetable change on 9 December 2007 a total of six pairs of modern ICE-T trains have worked the line at two-hourly intervals along with one Intercity pair of trains per day. The IC pair starts and ends at Passau, the ICE trains run on to Vienna. The long-distance stops are Regensburg, Plattling and Passau. Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains run hourly providing local services between Passau and Plattling and stopping at Vilshofen and Osterhofen. The Regional-Express trains run from Plattling directly to Munich. Regionalbahn trains also run hourly (two hourly at weekends) between Plattling and Regensburg, which continue to Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz and are sometimes connected through to and from Passau. = The future of passenger services = Munich–Landshut–Plattling–Passau (Danube-Isar Express) From the timetable change on 13 December 2009 the Danube-Isar Express will work part of the line. This is a Regional-Express route, which links Munich to Landshut, Plattling and Passau hourly and will stop at the remaining passenger stations on the route no. KBS 880, i.e. Plattling, Osterhofen, Vilshofen and Passau. It will replace all the previous Regionalbahn train services between Plattling and Passau.

She is the widow of American political activist Lyndon LaRouche, and the founder of the LaRouche movement's Schiller Institute and the German Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität party (BüSo) (Civil Rights Movement Solidarity). She has run for political office several times in Germany, representing small parties founded by the LaRouche movement, but has never been elected. She is the editor of Das Hitler-Buch (1984), published by the Schiller Institute, a collection of historical investigations into the origins of Nazism. Biography Lyndon LaRouche wrote in The Power of Reason (first edition) that his wife was an orphan. According to the Schiller Institute and Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität websites, she left high school in 1968 to work as an unpaid journalist in Hamburg and Hannover, later becoming a freelancer. In 1971, the websites continue, she traveled through China as one of the first European journalists there, just after the highpoint of the Cultural Revolution. When she returned to Germany, she studied political science, history and philosophy at the Otto Suhr Institute of the Free University of Berlin and at Frankfurt am Main. On December 29, 1977, Helga Zepp and Lyndon LaRouche were married in Wiesbaden. Since then, according to her official biography at the Schiller Institute website, she has traveled with her husband to promote his proposals for monetary reform and large-scale infrastructural development, and has met with former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi and former Mexican president José López Portillo. She returned to Mexico in 1998, and participated as mistress of ceremonies at a conference held at the Academy of Economics of the Mexican Society of Geography, during which Lopez Portillo greeted her once again, according to the LaRouche movement's Executive Intelligence Review. Earlier that year, Lopez Portillo, along with former Ugandan President Godfrey Binaisa, former Algerian Prime Minister Abdelhamid Brahimi and other politicians, had added his signature to a call issued by Zepp-LaRouche for a \\"new just world economic order.\\" Activism Zepp-LaRouche is the editor of Das Hitler-Buch, published by the Schiller Institute, Campaigner Publications Deutschland, Wiesbaden 1984. (translated as The Hitler Book, 1984. ) She founded the Schiller Institute in the same year, saying: \\"We need a movement that can finally free Germany from the control of the Versailles and Yalta treaties, thanks to which we have staggered from one catastrophe to another for an entire century.\\"Zepp-LaRouche biography, LaRouche website. Original in German: \\"Wir brauchen eine Bewegung, die Deutschland endlich aus der Kontrolle der Kräfte von Versailles und Jalta befreit, die uns schon ein ganzes Jahrhundert lang von einer Katastrophe in die andere stürzt.\\" In Dancing on My Grave (1986), ballerina Gelsey Kirkland describes her encounter with Zepp-LaRouche's ideas, as the former was battling her drug addiction: \\"In spite of her extreme point of view, her unyielding radicalism, this woman provided a crucial turning point for me. Her zealous devotion to the classics and her political war against drugs emboldened me to act, yet in my own way.\\"Gelsey, Kirkland. Dancing on my Grave, Doubleday, 1986. She is an opponent of the clash of civilizations doctrine of Samuel P. Huntington. Following the September 11 attacks, she campaigned against the idea that there is a fundamental antagonism between U.S. and Europe on the one side, and Islam or Asian culture on the other. She has called for a \\"Dialogue of Cultures\\" as opposed to a \\"Clash of Civilizations.\\" In June 2001, Zepp- LaRouche spoke before the Russian State Duma hearings on Measures to Ensure the Development of Russia's Economy under Conditions of Global Financial Destabilization. Her theme was the assertion that Dr. Wilhelm Lautenbach's program for productive employment, had it been adopted in 1931, could have ended the depression and prevented the Nazis' rise to power, and that the adoption of her husband's Eurasian Land-Bridge proposal today can avert a similar disaster. Zepp-LaRouche's presentation was later published in 2007 in the Russian magazine Forum International, in an issue devoted to the “Megaprojects of Russia’s East” conference on the Bering Strait crossing. Zepp-LaRouche has launched campaigns in various countries on other issues, including opposition to globalization and support for her husband's \\"New Bretton Woods\\" proposal, and a proposal to dissolve the World Trade Organization and double world food production. This latter proposal was described by the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram as \\"among the notable visions, worthy of respect, which are consistent with the vision put forward by President Mubarak in Davos.\\" In 2012, she was a featured speaker at the 10th annual “Dialogue of Civilizations” conference in Rhodes, sponsored by the World Public Forum. She said that the accelerating collapse of the transatlantic system is driving the danger of a new world war, and that US and European liquidity expansion measures have led to a hyper-inflationary printing of money, with its “life-shortening effect” upon millions of people in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal.Tatad, Francisco, \\"Can we lick the global meltdown without war?\\" , Manila Standard, October 10, 2012 In August 2015, Zepp- LaRouche wrote an article describing climate change as a \\"Satanic swindle\\". In her opinion, it \\"supplies the argumentation to establish a global eco- dictatorship whose results, and whose declared intention is to eliminate six billion human beings\\". Zepp-LaRouche argued that preparations are under-way for the establishment of \\"a fascist world government which would exceed Hitler’s most audacious dreams\\". Zepp-LaRouche suggested the origin of the \\"swindle\\" is the British monarchy. In July 2016, Zepp-LaRouche spoke at the first panel on the Think 20 Summit, which was organised by three Chinese academies and institutes: the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, and the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China.

According to Harley Schlanger, a LaRouche spokesperson, LYM's first major campaign was during the 2003 recall of California Governor Gray Davis, when it distributed over a million leaflets across the country, opposing the recall and depicting Arnold Schwarzenegger alongside Adolf Hitler. They also distributed tens of thousands of other pamphlets in California. In a 2004 article in the University of California, Berkeley independent student newspaper, The Daily Californian, reporter David Cohn described the local chapter of the LYM as \\"30 college-aged youths\\" who spent several hours each day undergoing instruction provided by the LaRouche organization. One member, 23-year-old Jason Ross, told Cohn that he had dropped out of Stanford University in his junior year to join the movement. \\"We are in a complete breakdown of the financial system and we know that. We can use our time in a more appropriate manner than going to school,\\" he said. Cohn also talked to three other members who had all quit school to join the movement. The Daily Californian reported the movement's numbers as \\"about 100 young people from Los Angeles to Oakland\\" who \\"travel to dozens of college campuses aggressively recruiting members and not hesitating to ask newcomers to quit school\\". As a result of the Internet, there are active chapters in nations like Japan where LaRouche has no official organization. The LYM has also expanded its activity into the African nations of South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique. =Democratic Party involvement = LYM members have been active in the Democratic Party at the state and local levels. In 2006, LaRouche Youth Movement activist and Los Angeles County Democratic Central Committee member Cody Jones was honored as \\"Democrat of the Year\\" for the 43rd Assembly District of California, by the Los Angeles County Democratic Party.EIR Volume 33, Number 27, July 7, 2006 p. 46: \\"Congress Held Accountable by Larouche PAC Drive\\" At the April 2007, California State Democratic Convention, LYM activist Quincy O'Neal was elected vice-chairman of the California State Democratic Black Caucus,California Democratic Convention: LaRouche Youth Bring Reality, Provide Leadership to Party EIR April 11, 2008The LaRouche Show: The LYM Report On Their Victory in California EIR May 11, 2007 and Wynneal Innocentes was elected corresponding secretary of the Filipino Caucus.California's Future Democratic Leaders Engage in Dialogue With State Chairman EIR September 14, 2007 O'Neal is also president of the LYM's Democratic Party Club, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Legacy Club, which is affiliated with the California Democratic Council.Franklin Roosevelt Legacy Democratic Club: Contact Us Archived on August 1, 2007 from the original In March 2010, LaRouche Youth leader Kesha Rogers won the Democratic congressional primary in Houston, Texas' 22nd District. =Pedagogy and campaigns= LaRouche is highly critical of contemporary college curricula, and has designed his own pedagogy for members of his youth movement, which he describes as \\"the reliving of the crucial discoveries of universal physical-scientific principle by, successively, the ancient Pythagoreans and Plato and the modern science of Johannes Kepler,\\" combined with the performance of classical vocal music, particularly Johann Sebastian Bach's Jesu, meine Freude. They spend time in what are called \\"Monge brigades,\\" which emphasize readings of Vladimir Vernadsky, Alexander Hamilton, Carl Gauss and Bernhard Riemann. The LaRouche Youth have been assisted around the U.S. in performance workshops on classical music, as well as African-American spirituals, by well known musicians William Warfield and Sylvia Olden Lee, and in drama performance by actor Robert Beltran. The LYM has disrupted university lectures to distribute their material. On October 23, 2006, a group of LaRouche Youth Movement members twice disrupted a Connecticut U.S. Senate debate between Alan Schlesinger, Ned Lamont, and Joseph Lieberman. According to The Day, as Joe Lieberman spoke, the hecklers \\"sang a harmonized ode targeting Vice President Dick Cheney, which, according to the group's website, is unofficially titled 'The Fat-Ass Nazi Song'.\\" During the election campaign of 2006, the LYM came into conflict with organizations including the Ayn Rand Institute, which the LYM accused of promoting genocide in speeches by its representatives at various campuses. LYM members confronted Institute executive director Yaron Brook at various universities across the US, heckling him and calling his policies \\"fascist\\". In one case, at the University of California, Irvine, 15 LYM members, some of whom violently resisted, were arrested. LYM members frequently combine political activity with choral music performance. They sang outside the Democratic Party Convention in Boston in 2004, and in 2007 they performed choral music with lyrics about impeaching Dick Cheney in classrooms at Harvard and Boston University. During 2007, LYM members have been seen in on the streets, campuses and conferences emphasizing two issues in particular: a call by LaRouche for the impeachment of Dick Cheney, and the assertion that the theory of human-caused global warming is a fraud motivated by Malthusianism. On this latter issue, LYM have confronted Al Gore on several occasions at his public events. In the Philippines, LYM members debated a variety of spokespersons for the Global Warming theory. In Argentina, LYM leader Betiana Gonzalez disrupted Gore's speech at a Biofuels conference. A similar incident took place earlier in the year in Montreal, Canada.EIR 30 March, Pavel Penev: \\"The Youth of Today Declare:‘We Will Not BeGorified!\\" In November 2007, the LYM launched a campaign against social networking websites such as MySpace and Facebook, with the mass distribution of the pamphlet \\"The Noosphere vs. The Blogosphere: Is the Devil in Your Laptop?\\" The pamphlet says that Rupert Murdoch, owner of MySpace, and Microsoft, owner of Facebook (Microsoft owns only 2.5% of Facebook), are involved in social engineering to destroy the cognitive powers and potential for political leadership among young people. TIME magazine's coverage of Kesha Rogers' campaign says that \\"The LYM espouses LaRouche opposition to free trade and 'globalism' (the UN, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund) and it also calls for a return to a humanist classical education, emphasizing the works of Plato and Leibniz.\\" =Criticism and accusations= Journalists, former members and law enforcement officials have made a wide variety of accusations of the LaRouche organizations, including a Scotland Yard report that called them a political cult. In 2006, college officials in Boston told a reporter that the LYM was one of the two leading high-pressure groups on area campuses, and that it engaged in strong- arm tactics to induce students to leave college and help recruit new members. Boyd called the charges \\"gossip\\" and said the movement was working \\"for ideas and real policies\\" and was a \\"youth movement in the Democratic Party\\". Investigative journalist and LaRouche biographer Dennis King has described the founding of the WLYM by LaRouche as a way of maintaining his legacy after his death by \\"[going] back to his roots, the roots of his movement in the radical campus movement in the late 1960s.\\" Avi Klein of the Washington Monthly describes this as an element of a campaign LaRouche created to blame the \\"first generation\\" of his own movement for fundraising failures, and to appeal to young members by channeling \\"the rage new acolytes felt toward their parents at a nearby, internal enemy\\". Jeremiah Duggan After spending six days at a Schiller Institute conference and LYM cadre school in Germany, 22-year-old Jeremiah Duggan, a Jewish student from London who was studying in Paris, was believed to have run onto a busy road in what the British coroner called a \\"state of terror,\\" and was killed. The German police investigation concluded that it was a suicide. A private forensic consultant said that he had found evidence of serious assault with a blunt instrument, but no public authorities have given credence to this claim. A LaRouche spokesman has said the young man killed himself because he was disturbed. In October 2004, a British inquest into Duggan's death heard allegations from his mother that LYM and the Schiller Institute may have used brainwashing techniques on her son to persuade him to join the movement.Samuels, Tim. \\"Jeremiah Duggan and Lyndon LaRouche,\\" part 1, Newsnight, BBC, February 2004, at 3:49; part 2 and part 3. Michael Winsted An ex-member of the LaRouche youth movement has asserted that the LaRouche Youth Movement calls parents \\"brainwashed baby boomers.\\" Ex-member Michael Winsted says that although members are convinced that they are involved in important political work, the job of most members is only to collect money and recruit more members. He says that group leaders \\"were constantly asking us if we would die for these ideas\\" and that members that become critical or disillusioned by the movement often become the focus of brutal psychological attacks by the other members, including accusations of having \\"mother issues,\\" of homosexuality, sexual deviance, and allegiance to anti-LaRouche conspiracies. They are often encouraged and even led by the group's managers. Winsted recounts: > I'm caught off-guard, like, what the hell just happened?...The yelling goes > on for maybe five or 10 minutes while I'm furiously backpedaling...They call > it making somebody a self-conscious organizer...It is about getting somebody > to break down and cry, just to have an emotional collapse. Once you do that, > then people are malleable. Jeffrey Steinberg, a top security aide in the LaRouche movement, responded by portraying Michael Winsted as an agent of the Washington Post who \\"briefly infiltrated the Baltimore chapter of the LYM\\". LaRouche PAC right The Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee was previously registered with the Federal Election Commission as \\"FDR PAC\\" and by \\"Spannaus in '96\\". In 2000, LaRouche's FDR PAC made news when, forbidden from soliciting on U.S. Post Office property, it demanded that the Salvation Army be treated the same way. As of 2002, Nancy Spannaus was the executive director of the PAC. LPAC and LYM members targeted Senator Joe Lieberman's reelection campaign in 2006. At one campaign appearance three members sang loudly \\"If you want a third world war, vote for Joe, Bill Buckley's whore\\". In 2007, two associates of LPAC, Robert Lucero and Tony DeFranco, were escorted off Post Office property in Naperville, Illinois, by police. The two were carrying signs calling President George W. Bush \\"dumb\\" and calling for the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney. During his 2007 campaign for the New Jersey General Assembly, Gordon M. Johnson's contributions to LPAC became a subject of criticism. Johnson reportedly made seven contributions in 2005 and 2006 totalling $1,850. He apologized repeatedly, saying he regretted that he was not \\"aware of the LaRouche record of anti-Semitism\\" and was asking for the contributions to be refunded. LPAC members promoted LaRouche's \\"Homeowners and Bank Protection Act\\" in 2009. One report says the act \\"would establish a federal agency that would place federal- and state-chartered banks under protection, freeze all existing home mortgages for a period of time, adjust mortgage values to fair prices, restructure existing mortgages at appropriate interest rates, and write off speculative debt obligations of mortgage-backed securities\\". According to one opponent, Congressman Paul E. Kanjorski, on closer inspection the act \\"calls for seizure by the government\\" of all U.S banks. In 2009 LPAC members were noted for their posters which depicted Barack Obama with a Hitler-style toothbrush mustache. They asked pedestrians \\"Do you want to stop Obama from killing people?\\" and \\"Want to fire our Nazi president?\\" The posters led to violent reactions from passersby, including one man who had lost family members in World War II. LPAC spokesperson Nancy Spannaus said that the posters were an \\"honest emblem of what the administration policy represents\\". A 2009 report says that the LPAC website, LaRouchePAC.com, appeared to have deliberately copied the look of the Barackobama.com website, though the contents were entirely different. The LPAC website reportedly contained satires of Democratic Party leaders and an attack of wind power. Following complaints from customers, Kroger, a national grocery store chain, received an injunction in 2009 barring LPAC activists from soliciting donations or distributing literature on their Ralphs and Food 4 Less properties in Southern California. Another grocery chain, Trader Joe's, also sought an injunction after customers allegedly complained that the LPAC members had called them \\"bitches\\" and \\"Hitler lovers\\". Stater Brothers also sought an injunction to bar LPAC members from soliciting in front of their stores. Lyndon LaRouche, LPAC, and its treasurer Barbara Boyd were sued in 2009 by the widow of Kenneth Kronberg, who alleges that they had defamed her in an LPAC article. Kronberg and his wife had been longtime members of LaRouche movement before his suicide. By 2010, LPAC members were calling for Obama's impeachment. Members of the Tea Party movement distanced themselves from the LPAC members, who often appeared at Tea Party rallies. One Tea Party officials complained that the \\"Obama as Hitler\\" posters \\"trivializes the travesties that occurred under the Fascist regime of Nazi Germany\\". In 2010, LPAC members said the PAC staffed from 80 to 100 tables across the country every day. Several confrontations between supporters of LPAC candidates and local residents were reported in April 2011 in Healdsburg, California. The police were called repeatedly, but no one was cited. Other LPAC workers report receiving a positive reception in San Francisco in March 2011. Funding and locations A table with LaRouche literature and a \\"Join LaRouche PAC\\" poster in May 2005, in Washington D.C. LPAC received about $6 million during the 2009-2010 election cycle, according to public records and Out of the Storm News, a publication of The Heartland Institute. Donations came from nearly 5000 individuals, a large percentage of them from employees of the PAC or its affiliates. The largest donation, $12,425, came from Kathy Magraw, listed as a supervisor at LaRouche's Executive Intelligence Review. Magraw is also the largest individual recipient of funds from the PAC, receiving $129,705 during the cycle. LYM received $3,142,142 from LPAC in the 2009-2010 election cycle. The Center for Public Integrity reports that almost $6 million of the $13 million raised by LPAC since 2007 went to LaRouche Youth, to pay for \\"grassroots lobbying and advocacy\\". The LaRouche Political Action Committee paid the group $462,850 in 2006, $2,732,851 during the 2008 election cycle, and $4,186,068 in the 2010 cycle. According to Boyd, the payments to LaRouche Youth LLC are for web content, field organizing, canvassing, and public advocacy, all of which are categorized as \\"grassroots lobbying and advocacy\\". Boyd said the nearly $500,000 in uncategorized \\"petty cash\\" payments went to political organizing activities across the country, mostly vehicle operating expenses. In 2006, LPAC paid $7000 in fines to the FEC for failing to file mandatory disclosure forms. LPAC gave $11,000 in contributions to three candidates in the 2009-2010 election cycle: $4000 each to \\"Kesha Rogers For Congress\\" and \\"Summer Shields for Congress\\", and $3000 to \\"Rachel Brown For Congress\\".

According to Boyd, LPAC pays LYM to produce videos. Most of the videos on Kesha Roger's campaign website were created by LPAC. From 2006 to 2007, members of the team produced a set of computer animations described as a pedagogical tour through Johannes Kepler's New Astronomy and Harmony of the World, plus another set on the discovery of the orbit of Ceres titled The Mind of Gauss. After another website, keplersdiscovery.com, appeared that discussed the same works by Kepler, team members asserted that it was a plagiarized and inferior copy of their own work. In August 2008, the team released an hour- long video, The Harvard Yard, in which they elaborate their claim of plagiarism and charge that the \\"Kepler's Discovery\\" site was the work of Harvard University. In 2008 they issued Firewallin Defense of the Nation State. This was followed by the release on July 3 of the feature-length sequel 1932, narrated by Robert Beltran, and a December production on scientific method, The Matter of Mind. They are also producing regular short videos on topical issues.

Recognized principally for his recorded output in the mid-to-late sixties, his rediscovery by the current generation of American and European outsider folk artists has seen his work accorded similar reverence to that of other notable American finger-pickers such as Sandy Bull, John Fahey, Robbie Basho and Leo Kottke, and granted him a renewed platform for both touring and recording. Life and career Walker was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1938, into a musical family. His Father played Guitar and Mandolin, and his mother was a Concert Pianist who played in the first all woman's Orchestra in the US. He began to play the Guitar and harmonica from an early age. In 1952 he left home at age 14 hitchhiking throughout the US from Maine to Florida and across country from coast to coast. After a stint in the US Army in 1960 he founded the Cambridge Folklore Center in Harvard Square. From his Base in Cambridge he continued to travel extensively for 5 years doing musical research in Mexico, North Africa, Algeria, Morocco, and Spain, often comparing notes with his friend and peer Sandy Bull. In 1965 he committed himself to touring and public performance from 1965 onward, becoming a fixture of the Greenwich Village folk scene of the mid-'60s (during which period he became particularly close to Sandy Bull and Karen Dalton, Monty Dunn, Bruce Langhorne, Bob Gibson, Tim Hardin, and Fred Neil. Earlier in the 60's, Walker's attendance at a Ravi Shankar performance in San Francisco saw him embrace extended periods of study of Eastern raga under both Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan. Through mutual Boston associates Walker also developed a strong friendship with LSD pioneer Timothy Leary, and was \\"Musical Director\\", for Dr. Leary's \\"Psychedelic Celebrations. Walker's debut LP Rainy Day Raga was released by Vanguard Records in 1966, followed by the release of Second Poem in 1968. Walker diverted his attention away from public performance and towards family life at the start of the 1970s, but maintained a commitment to study of his instrument, focusing particularly upon Flamenco. In 2000 he returned to Spain and made several trips each year,living in the Gypsy communities, studying in Granada, and playing lead guitar at Casa Anselma in Seville. In 2007 Walker was coaxed out of this semi-retirement by Joshua Rosenthal of Tompkins Square Records, for whom he recorded four new pieces to be set alongside musical tributes from younger admirers including Jack Rose, James Blackshaw, Steffen Basho-Junghans and Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore on the 2008 collection A Raga for Peter Walker. A full album of new material, Echo of My Soul, was released by Tompkins Square later the same year. In 2009 Birdman Records released \\"Spanish Guitar\\" and in 2013 Delmore Recording Society released \\"Has Anybody Seen Our Freedoms?\\". In 2015 3rd Man recordings released \\"Peter Walker Live at 3rd Man.\\" These releases were supported by extensive touring and live performance, sparking a renewed level of interest which culminated in a recorded session for Stuart Maconie on BBC 6 Music, and an extended interview on BBC Radio 4's flagship early morning current affairs show The Today Programme. In 2014 Peter released 3 books on Amazon. \\"Karen Dalton Songs Poems and Writings\\", a collection of material written by his friend Karen Dalton, \\"Tune Up Drop In\\" a guitar teaching Book, and \\"Road to Marscota\\" a fictional story of the Early 60's.

It is a love song, although the intended subject of the song is God rather than a woman. The song has been included on several compilation and live albums. It was also included on several of Townshend's solo projects. Critics have praised the song's lyricism and power, as well as the performance of the band on the song. Townshend acknowledged during the Who's concert at the Prudential Center in Newark on 19 March 2016 that this is his favorite song on the album. Lyrics and music \\"Bargain\\" is a love song. The opening lines are: The lyrics are typical love song lyrics in which the singer says he will give up everything to win his love, and that the singer would consider that a bargain. However, the lyrics do not identify who the subject of the singer's love is. Townshend has stated the song was influenced by Indian mystic Meher Baba and that the subject of the song is God. Townshend has stated \\"The song is simply about losing one's ego as a devotee of Meher Baba. I constantly try to lose myself and find him. I'm not very successful, I'm afraid, but this song expresses how much of a bargain it would be to lose everything in order to be at one with God.\\" \\"Bargain\\" begins with a gentle acoustic guitar part played by Townshend. A drone is played softly in the background. The energy picks up with Keith Moon's drum fills and Townshend's rhythm guitar chords before Roger Daltrey begins to sing the lyrics. Daltrey sings most of the lyrics energetically and powerfully, but there is a gentler section sung by Townshend. In this gentler section, backed by John Entwistle's bass guitar, Townshend starts by singing: The line \\"I know I'm worth nothing without you\\" in particular shows the influence of Meher Baba's teachings. Other themes of the song include the search for self- identity and the balance within the human psyche of the id and the ego. Instrumentation of \\"Bargain\\" includes an ARP synthesizer, which is used both as a solo instrument and as a backing instrument while Townshend plays a guitar solo. That guitar solo was praised by Rolling Stone critic John Mendelsohn, as well as by the Who authors Chris Charlesworth, Steve Grantley and Alan Parker. Moon's drum fills have also been heavily praised, as have Entwistle's bass lines. Townshend used several guitars on \\"Bargain,\\" including a 1959 Gretsch Chet Atkins guitar that he received from Joe Walsh, as a gift. At least nine versions of \\"Bargain\\" were recorded between April and June 1971. Townshend was particularly effusive in his praise for the sound associate producer Glyn Johns was able to achieve, particularly for the acoustic guitars. Critical reception John Swenson of Rolling Stone described \\"Bargain\\" as one of \\"Townshend's most beautiful songs.\\" Author John Atkins praised song's strength and melody as well as the Who's performance of the song. Atkins goes on to say that \\"'Bargain' radiates sheer dynamism and excitement, and the brilliance of the playing turns the song into a masterpiece.\\" Allmusic critic Tom Maginnis calls \\"Bargain\\" one of the \\"explosively dynamic tracks found on the Who's seminal Who's Next album. Other appearances A live performance of \\"Bargain\\" from San Francisco on December 12, 1971 was included on the 1985 the Who album Who's Missing. This version was later included in the compilation album Thirty Years of Maximum R&B; in 1994. The studio version was included on the compilation album The Ultimate Collection in 2002. Pete Townshend included solo recordings of \\"Bargain\\" on his albums Scoop and The Lifehouse Chronicles.

Kruse was one of 5 top Socialist Party leaders targeted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1919. William F. \\"Bill\\" Kruse (1894-1979) was an important head of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL) in the 1910s. He was a member of the Socialist Party of America until 1921, acting as a leader of the party's Left Wing faction, loyal to the Third International (Comintern). Thereafter he joined the Workers Party of America, serving as Assistant Executive Secretary of the WPA from the time of its foundation in December 1921. BiographyEarly years= William F. \\"Bill\\" Kruse was born in Hoboken, New Jersey to German and Danish immigrant parents in 1894. Kruse worked briefly as a sheet metal worker in his youth. He later studied at the Socialist Party of America's Rand School of Social Science under Algernon Lee. =Political career= In July 1915, the governing National Executive Committee of the SPA appointed the 21-year-old as Director of the party's youth section, the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL).\\"Young People's Socialist League: Organizational History,\\" Early American Marxism website, marxisthistory.org/ Kruse served two terms in this position, finishing in June 1918. He also served as editor of the YPSL's national publication, Young Socialists' Magazine, from 1918 to 1919 and as the Provisional Secretary of the SPA's national Socialist Sunday School movement. Kruse was the fraternal delegate of the YPSL to the party's seminal 1917 Emergency National Convention in St. Louis. Militantly opposed to the war in Europe, Kruse, a law school graduate, worked to defend the civil rights of war opponents as a leader of the American Liberty Defense League. As head of the Socialist Party's youth organization and a vociferous critic of American participation in the war, Kruse was targeted by the US Department of Justice headed by Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer under the Espionage Act. Kruse was indicted in Chicago by a grand jury on Feb. 2, 1918, and the secret indictment was made public on March 9. The sensational and widely publicized trial of Kruse and 4 other top members of the Socialist Party began before Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis on Dec. 6, 1918. This trial ended Jan. 4, 1919, with the jury finding Kruse and his associates (Victor L. Berger, Adolph Germer, J. Louis Engdahl, Irwin St. John Tucker) guilty. Landis sentenced each to 20 years in the Federal penitentiary, a sentence which was appealed and later overturned on the basis of judicial bias. As head of the Young People's Socialist League, Bill Kruse was a frequent speaker on the Socialist Party's lecture circuit. Released on bond, Kruse continued as a Contributing Editor of Young Socialists' Magazine from March 1919. He was a delegate to the 1919 Emergency National Convention of the SPA in August 1919,\\"Delegates to the 1919 Emergency Convention of the Socialist Party of America,\\" Marxists Internet Archive, marxists.org/ representing a Left Wing voice on the floor, but refusing to bolt the convention to join the Communist Labor Party of America gathering downstairs. Kruse was elected to serve on a new party institution to oversee controversial personnel decisions of the NEC, the Board of Appeals, and he continued in this role on this largely unused body until 1920. In September 1919, with the YPSL moving to organizational independence under its Secretary, Oliver Carlson, Kruse was named head of the SPA's new \\"Young People's Department.\\" He also resumed editorship of Young Socialists' Magazine, now back under party control. Kruse also worked as a National Organizer for the SPA, rebuilding the Rhode Island state organization, among other tasks. Kruse was a Socialist candidate for the US House of Representatives from the Illinois 6th C.D. in 1918 and again 1920, and for Illinois Secretary of State in 1921.Lawrence Kestenbaum (ed.), \\"William F. Kruse,\\" The Political Graveyard, politicalgraveyard.com/ Retrieved June 2, 2011. Kruse remained active in the Left Wing movement inside the SPA until the fall of 1921, organizing the Committee for the Third International with his associates Louis Engdahl and Alexander Trachtenberg. After the triumph of the party's Regulars at the 1921 Convention, Kruse, Engdahl, and their associates left the party, advocating for an \\"open\\" Communist Party in the United States. This desire came to fruition in December 1921 with the establishment of the Workers Party of America, in which Kruse served as the Assistant Executive Secretary from the time of its foundation. He was also elected by the founding convention of the WPA as an Alternate to the WPA's governing Central Executive Committee. On June 29, 1929, Kruse was promoted to full member of the CEC of the WPA when Marguerite Prevey resigned. Kruse was an adherent of the Pepper-Ruthenberg- Lovestone faction throughout the Communist Party's factional struggles of the 1920s. From 1926 to 1927, Kruse was among the first Americans to study at the Comintern's Lenin School in Moscow, where he also served in an informal capacity as a lieutenant of the Lovestone faction in the USSR.Benjamin Gitlow, I Confess: The Truth About American Communism. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1940; pg. 425. Upon his return in 1927, Kruse was appointed by the CEC as District Organizer of the Communist Party's important Chicago district. In 1928 Kruse stood as the candidate for Governor of Illinois of the Workers (Communist) Party.\\"Kruse to Tour South Illiniois,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 5, no. 238 (October 8, 1928), pg. 1. Kruse was expelled from the Communist (Workers) Party in 1929 for refusing to denounce party leader Jay Lovestone. He left radical politics and became Educational Director for Bell and Howell Films, later opening his own public relations firm in Chicago, William F. Kruse & Associates.

Kruse went to great lengths to ensure the field of Instructional Design and Technology (IDT) had an archive for future research and much of the Association for Educational Communication and Technology (AECT) archive in Hornbake Library at the University of Maryland is the result of his efforts. For example, the first three boxes in the archive contain correspondence by Kruse in his attempt to find materials for the archive, Kruse's sources for his unpublished manuscript on the history of the field and numerous photographic collections by Kruse related to the history of IDT. The AECT archive at the University of Maryland contains a copy of Kruse's unpublished book, The Projected Image.Kruse, W.F. (n.d.). The projected image: A history of audio-visual education. Association of Educational Communications and Technologies Archive, Box 26. College Park, MD. A portion of this book was published in The Journal of Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers under the title Willard Beach Cook-Pioneer Distributor of Narrow-Gage Safety Films and Equipment.Kruse, W.F. (1964). Willard Beach Cook — Pioneer distributor of narrow-gage safety films and equipment. Journal of the Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers, 73 (7), 576-579. The unpublished book is 430 pages long, is heavily marked with notes and editing lines, and contains a mix of educational and industry observations. The preface states: The Story of the development of the projected image as a means of communication involves such a close and constant interrelationship of education and of industry that its telling is materially enriched by the authoritative dual viewpoint that Mr. Kruse is uniquely qualified to give. Kruse was outspoken and a strong proponent for the use of audio-visual communication. In his introduction he stated: It is high time, too, that the audio-visual specialist refuses to be looked down on as a Johnny-come-lately upstart. The roots of his professional family tree run deeper than those of the verbalist critic. That audio-visual education is at once the newest and the oldest form of learning known to the human race is the point of our first chapter. Though Kruse did not directly write about the goals of his study, the first two chapters of his book were written to show that it was the audio- visual specialist who, \\"raised teaching to the level of learned profession, who gave new vistas to the science of psychology and who supplied the basis for new humane philosophical trends\\" . Kruse wrote that his manuscript was for the, \\"audio-visual specialist, the teacher, the audio-visual industry worker, the person with a story to tell and lastly, all of us, citizens, as fellow- men\\" . He was clear that he wanted to show in his history that, \\"The audio- visual process- which integrates a learner's sensory experience with his apperceptional reservoir and thus fits him for better living in his society- is education\\". =Death and legacy= Bill Kruse died in 1979. The William F. Kruse papers are housed at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, as well as the Chicago Historical Society.

The Rokushō-ji were \\"sacred vow temples\\" (gogan-ji) built by imperial command following a precedent established by Emperor Shirakawa's Hosshō-ji. Although these temple complexes were ostensibly established for a presumptively pious purpose, :the relationship of Emperors Shirakawa, Toba, Sutoku, and Konoe with Hosshō-ji and the other \\"imperial vow\\" temples and with the imperial residences that adjoined the temple complexes is quite revealing. Clearly the temples were not built simply as acts of piety but as ways of protecting estate income and a certain style of life. Evidently the building of new temples could serve as a coercive device to extract support from other kuge families and to justify the use of public taxes for the benefit of members of the imperial-house, the religious intent giving support to the political interest.Hall, John Whitney et al.

Lee, A. Edward Sutherland, Lothar Mendes, Otto Brower, Edwin H. Knopf, Frank Tuttle, and Victor Schertzinger—all supervised by the production supervisor, singer, actress, and songwriter Elsie Janis. Featured stars included Jean Arthur, Richard Arlen, Clara Bow, Evelyn Brent, Buddy Rogers, Jack Oakie, Helen Kane, Maurice Chevalier, Nancy Carroll, George Bancroft, Kay Francis, Richard \\"Skeets\\" Gallagher, Gary Cooper, Fay Wray, Lillian Roth and other Paramount stars. The screenplay was written by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, produced by Adolph Zukor and Jesse L. Lasky, with cinematography by Victor Milner and Harry Fischbeck. Production Paramount on Parade, released on April 22, 1930, was Paramount's answer to all-star revues like Hollywood Revue of 1929 from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, The Show of Shows from Warner Bros., and King of Jazz from Universal Studios. The film had 20 individual segments—several of them in two-color Technicolor — directed by 11 directors, and almost every star on the Paramount roster except Claudette Colbert and the Marx Brothers. (Colbert became a star in May 1930 with the release of The Big Pond, also with Chevalier and also released in a French- language version.) Cecil B. DeMille was also not involved in the revue as he had moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1928 and would not return until 1932 to direct The Sign of the Cross.Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

See also command information. (JP 3-61)\\"JP 3-61  Definition  Military journalists are part Public Affairs, defined by JP 1-02 as \\"Those public information, command information, and community relations activities directed toward both the external and internal publics with interest in the Department of Defense.\\" Command information, therefore, is just one of the responsibilities of Public Affairs set by Department of Defense policy. DoDD 5122.5 sets forth these Principles of Information: > E2.1. INFORMATION It is DoD policy to make available timely and accurate > information so that the public, the Congress, and the news media may assess > and understand the facts about national security and defense strategy. > Requests for information from organizations and private citizens shall be > answered quickly. In carrying out that DoD policy, the following principles > of information shall apply: E2.1.1. Information shall be made fully and > readily available, consistent with statutory requirements, unless its > release is precluded by national security constraints or valid statutory > mandates or exceptions. The \\"Freedom of Information Act\\" will be supported > in both letter and spirit. E2.1.2. A free flow of general and military > information shall be made available, without censorship or propaganda, to > the men and women of the Armed Forces and their dependents. E2.1.3. > Information will not be classified or otherwise withheld to protect the > Government from criticism or embarrassment. E2.1.4. Information shall be > withheld when disclosure would adversely affect national security, threaten > the safety or privacy of U.S. Government personnel or their families, > violate the privacy of the citizens of the United States, or be contrary to > law. E2.1.5. The Department of Defense's obligation to provide the public > with information on DoD major programs may require detailed Public Affairs > (PA) planning and coordination in the Department of Defense and with the > other Government Agencies. Such activity is to expedite the flow of > information to the public; propaganda has no place in DoD public affairs > programs. DODD 5122.5, Sep. 27, 2000 JP 1-02 defines propaganda as \\"Any form of communication in support of national objectives designed to influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, or behavior of any group in order to benefit the sponsor, either directly or indirectly.\\" The effort to counter enemy propaganda, therefore, both directly and indirectly benefits the sponsor. It has been a function of Psychological Operations (PSYOP) and not Public Affairs. JP 1-02 defines Counterpropaganda Operations as \\"Those psychological operations (PSYOP) activities that identify adversary propaganda, contribute to situational awareness, and serve to expose adversary attempts to influence friendly populations and military forces. (JP 3-53)\\"JP 3-53 Each branch of service has regulations that further define the roles of military journalists, but in a time of war, for example, Doctrine for Public Affairs in Joint Operations (JP 3-61) \\"provides joint doctrine for public affairs support during joint operations and US military support to news media in conjunction with military operations.\\" JP 3-61 states, \\"PA must be aware of the practice of PSYOP, but should have no role in planning or executing these operations.\\" The responsibilities of Public Affairs vs PSYOP are, therefore, fundamentally different. JP 3-61 of May 14, 1997 contained no references to adversary propaganda. JP 3-61 was updated May 9, 2005 to include 16 references to adversary propaganda, which includes this revision: \\"Public affairs counters propaganda and disinformation by providing a continuous flow of credible, reliable, timely, and accurate information to military members, their families, the media, and the public. This capability allows PA to help defeat adversary efforts to diminish national will, degrade morale, and turn world opinion against friendly operations. PA must be engaged in operational planning, have visibility into domestic and international press reports, as well as relevant intelligence, understand common adversary propaganda techniques, and be very aggressive by anticipating and countering adversary propaganda—putting accurate, complete information out first so that friendly forces gain the initiative and remain the preferred source of information. Gaining and maintaining the information initiative in a conflict can help discredit and undermine adversary propaganda. ... PA operations keep military members and their families informed about operations, events, and issues to counter adversary propaganda efforts, and reduce stress and uncertainty, and other factors that may undermine mission accomplishment.\\" The impact of this conflicting update means that the military journalist is required by doctrine to never \\"influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, or behavior of any group in order to benefit the sponsor, either directly or indirectly\\" while at the same time \\"help defeat adversary efforts to diminish national will, degrade morale, and turn world opinion against friendly operations\\" and \\"to counter adversary propaganda efforts,and reduce stress and uncertainty, and other factors that may undermine mission accomplishment\\". The military journalist is required by doctrine to participate in counter propaganda efforts, even though the same doctrine defines those efforts as a function of PSYOP, which is something Public Affairs should never execute, according to the same doctrine. Military journalists must rely on the Combatant Commander's responsibility, IAW JP 3-61, to \\"Ensure planned ground rules for releasing information to civilian media apply equally to military journalists and broadcasters.\\" Then military journalists are unable to release information until it is cleared by a designated release authority, a Public Affairs Officer, whose responsibility is to coordinate and synchronize efforts with PSYOP. Despite the information being releasable according to the DOD Principles of Information, the official policy of \\"Maximum disclosure with minimum delay\\", and does not violate Operations Security (OPSEC) or threaten national security, any number of subjective factors arising from public perception cause a military journalist's information to be withheld from public release, some of which are detailed in DODI 5230.29. According to which, \\"All information submitted for review to OSR must first be coordinated within the originating DoD Component to ensure that it reflects the organization’s policy position.\\" An additional contradiction in doctrine then arises when news does not reflect \\"the organization’s policy position.\\" Added to which, all news that is released must reflect the organization's policy position, despite doctrine prohibiting information \\"in order to benefit the sponsor, either directly or indirectly\\" and other doctrine encouraging the \\"free flow of information.\\" The Army's policy for military journalists is further clarified in FM 46-1: \\"Not all news is good news ... the Army and its operations will be both positive and negative. ... PAOs cannot control media coverage or guarantee positive media products. DoD policy is that information will not be classified or otherwise withheld to protect the government from criticism or embarrassment. Information can only be withheld when its disclosure would adversely affect national and operations security or threaten the safety or privacy of members of the military community. ... It is DoD and Army policy to take an active approach to providing information. The Army will practice the principle of \\"maximum disclosure with minimum delay\\", even though this will sometimes result in the publication of stories which are not favorable to the command. ... Because the Army is an agency of the U.S. government, its internal audiences, local community members, and members of the American public as a whole, have a right to know about its operations. More importantly, the Army has an obligation to keep these audiences informed. ... Public affairs operations should employ an active approach. PAOs must take the lead in contributing to accurate, credible, and balanced coverage by practicing maximum disclosure with minimum delay.\\" Yet the same doctrine states, \\"Public affairs operations should be planned and executed to influence the presentation of information about the force by providing truthful, complete, and timely information that communicates the Army perspective\\", despite conflicting doctrine that denounces propaganda to \\"influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, or behavior of any group in order to benefit the sponsor, either directly or indirectly\\". In other Army doctrine explaining an Information Operations Estimate, FM 3-13, \\"IO-cell members—especially the PSYOP, civil-military operations, and public affairs (PA) representatives—identify how best to influence the attitudes and actions of the civilian populace...\\" and in a Commander's Guidance example, \\"Use PA to favorably influence the population in the AO and worldwide. Emphasize the lead role of the ASA and tell the truth: that we are here to assist a well-trained army accomplish a worthwhile mission.\\" The Public Affairs Officer must help, \\"ensure an integrated strategy and a unified effort to communicate the Army’s perspective and to favorably portray tactical and operational objectives.\\" One distinctly effective way (of many) that suppresses military journalism in conflict with this \\"perspective\\" or \\"organizational policy\\" is taught outside of official, high-level, DoD policy at the Defense Information School, where military journalists and Public Affairs Officers are trained: Command Messages: \\"plain or secret language\\" that \\"communicate the command's position in everything we do\\" which are designed for informing and \\"persuading – through accurately provided information – those publics to support and accept the action.\\" This is a \\"Command Message (your organization's policy or position)\\" Another distinctly effective way that suppresses civilian journalism in conflict with these \\"command messages\\" is to employ: Media ground rules: Guidelines that media must adhere to if they want to continue getting support from the military. One of 20 media ground rules, as of October 15, 2009, that applies equally to civilian and military journalists in the CJTF-82's Area of Operations (AO) in Afghanistan, for example, is \\"During interviews, no questions will be asked about the politics of the military. (e.g. Iraq war, equipment, readiness, funding, etc.)\\" Most ground rules are justified by Operations Security. Funding? These policies remain despite the Commander in Chief, Barack Obama's Open Government Directive that conveys the, \\"Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.\\" The U.S. military journalist, therefore, is a journalist whose job, at the highest level of accountability, is defined by an obligation to fully inform the public without design to directly or indirectly benefit the military, but who must also fight subjective policy, ambiguous definitions, and conflicting doctrine designed to deceive the public with hidden political agendas. The military has been increasingly spending billions to do so, in which Sheldon Rampton, research director for the Committee on Media and Democracy, calls a \\"massive apparatus selling the military to us.\\" See also * Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs * Demonizing the enemy * Embedded journalism * Psychological warfare  References  Category:Military specialisms Category:Journalism occupations ","title":"Military journalism in the United States"},{"id":"20903670","text":"Rob Denton (November 20, 1907 – August 12, 1997) was an American soccer goalkeeper who was a member of the United States soccer team at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

It was the final film directed by Michael Winner. Upon release in the UK, the film gained controversy over its plot, and was widely criticised in the national press. It has since been evaluated as one of the worst films ever made. Plot Harry Sterndale is diagnosed with cancer and has only six weeks to live. The following day, he meets his self-centred estranged wife Lisa, but when he tries to tell her of his diagnosis, she takes no notice and casually insults him. As Harry later looks through his photo album, he is reminded of the numerous people who have made his life a misery. Feeling he has nothing to lose, Harry decides to kill them. Harry meets bartender Freda Armstrong to illegally buy a pistol. The next day, he visits Lisa and shows her his diagnosis report; Lisa's continued lack of tact prompts Harry to shoot her. He is visited by Inspector Charles Bass and DC Ray regarding her death, but neither of the two consider him suspicious. Harry's next target is Gerd Layton, his crooked former financial advisor who lost Harry and Lisa's money. Visiting Layton at his house, Harry drowns him in his swimming pool. Jill Saunders, Layton's house keeper, catches him in the act, but is content with the murder, herself one of many to have suffered due to Layton. After sharing an intimate evening with Jill, Harry decides to leave her the money from his life insurance. Harry's best friend John Fraser informs him that Jill will inherit more money if Harry dies violently. Harry takes Jill to a restaurant, where they are treated poorly by the staff. After expressing distaste for their food, they are viciously confronted and thrown out by owner Renzo Locatelli. Harry later returns to the restaurant and shoots Renzo. Bass and Ray discover that the same gun was used to kill both Lisa and Renzo; Harry's house is raided by the police, where they also learn of Harry's connection with Layton. Meanwhile, Harry hires hitman Jamie Campbell-Stewart to kill him. When Harry returns home he is confronted by the police, but he points out they have no actual evidence and forces them out. Bass orders a 24-hour watch on Harry's house, but Harry leaves just as they arrive. Harry and Jill encounter Graham Cleverley, an old school bully of Harry's, who drunkenly disturbs them throughout the night, prompting Harry to shoot him the following day. Harry's final target is Maurice Walpole; his former business partner who stole his ideas when they tried to go into advertising. Over night, he attaches a petrol covered rope to Maurice's car, and as Maurice drives to work the next morning, Harry sets it alight, blowing up the car with Maurice in it. Harry phones Jamie to meet for the killing, but later suffers stomach pains, prompting Jill to call an ambulance. Both Ray and Jamie arrive at the hotel where Harry and Jill are staying just as Harry is taken away by the medics. It later turns out Harry had been misdiagnosed; he actually had a stomach ulcer. Jamie, who had followed the ambulance from the hotel, sneaks into the hospital to kill Harry, but accidentally shoots Ray in the arm. Harry and Jill escape back to the hotel whilst Bass unsuccessfully pursues Jamie. Jamie arrives at the hotel to shoot Harry in the midst of an campaign targeted against a foreign dictator, President Zlomov, who is staying at the hotel. Jamie accidentally shoots and kills Zlomov. With the killing having happened amongst a large audience, Jamie realises that he has no chance of avoiding prison, and takes the blame for Harry's murders as well as his own. Harry and Jill get married and visit Jamie - who has received widespread praise for killing Zlomov - in prison. While there, they agree to kill a man whom Jamie hadn't got around to killing himself.

Speaking to Tim Sebastian of the BBC in June 1999, Winner revealed: \\"We all have people we'd like to kill. Sometimes we want to kill them for a long time and sometimes it just lasts the few seconds that they're cutting you up, or being a nuisance. A girlfriend parted very nastily, and I thought 'I really wouldn't mind killing you' and five or six years later I thought, 'I still wouldn't mind.'\\" The majority of the cast was chosen personally by Winner, and included friends, those he had worked with professionally before, or other actors/actresses he wished to work with. Early discussions for the lead role suggested Neil Morrissey or Martin Clunes; however, when Winner met Chris Rea on a beach at Sandy Lane, Barbados, he was chosen instead. After filming had come to an end, Winner had told his personal assistant, Dinah May, that Parting Shots was likely to be his last film. Regardless, he had said working with Rea was \\"a real pleasure\\" and that he had enjoyed making the film more than any of his past ones. According to Peter Davison, John Alderton was offered the role of John. Alderton turned it down because of the violence, and the part went to Davison instead. Reception Parting Shots was not well received by critics, with Rotten Tomatoes giving the film an 11% of freshness while Total Film describes Winner's work as \\"offensive\\", \\"incompetent\\" and \\"bad in every possible way\\". Andrew Collins gave a strongly negative review of the film: \\"Parting Shots... is going to set the course of British film-making back 20 years. It is not only the worst British film produced in this country since Carry On Emmannuelle (quite a feat in itself), it is a thoroughbred contender for the crown of Worst Film Ever Made\\".Andrew Collins, \\"How to Shoot a Real Turkey\\". The Observer, 28 March 1999. Observer Screen, p.6. In a hostile overview of Winner's films, Christopher Tookey claimed \\"Parting Shots is not only the most horrible torture for audiences that Winner has ever devised. It is also profoundly offensive, even by Winner's standards\\". Tookey added: \\"...not only does it lack a sense of humour. It's uniquely repellent. It's rather as Kind Hearts and Coronets might have turned out, had it been directed by Fred and Rosemary West\\".Christopher Tookey, \\"Michael Winner's latest film is his most offensive yet\\". The Daily Mail, 11 May 1999, (p.11). Tookey also denounced Parting Shots as \\"the most tasteless, abysmal comedy of all time\\". Interviewed about Parting Shots, Charlotte O'Sullivan, The Independent's film editor, claimed Parting Shots was \\"the worst film I've ever seen\\". O'Sullivan also took issue with the film for glorifying vigilantism: \\"It's Michael Winner and you know, he doesn't have any sense of irony. He seems to be saying it is okay to go and kill people\\".\\"Winner's Turkey has a bad aftertaste.\\" The Sunday Herald, 2 May 1999 (p.7) The journalist Miles Kington later claimed \\"Parting Shots...was directed by Michael Winner and despite the glittering cast, was possibly the worst film ever made\\".Miles Kington, \\"One or two plots to occupy my declining years\\". The Independent, 3 May 2005, (p.30). In its entry on Michael Winner, the book Contemporary British and Irish Film Directors claimed Parting Shots \\"makes a bold challenge for the hotly contested mantle of worst British film ever made.\\"Contemporary British and Irish Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide, edited by Yoram Allon, Del Cullen, and Hannah Patterson.

His first credit as a director was for Feed the Kitty in 1938. Studio head Walter Lantz was taking a hiatus from directing at this time, this gave Lovy an opportunity to direct many of the studio's shorts in the 1938-1940 period. He stepped down to become an animator in 1940 after Lantz reverted to being director. However, he continued to play an important role in the production of the shorts, and stepped up to being the studio's lead director of Woody Woodpecker shorts when Lantz retired from directing in 1942. The following year, however, Lovy was drafted into the US Navy and left the studio; Shamus Culhane in the meantime replaced Lovy. After the end of World War II, Lovy worked briefly for Columbia Pictures' cartoon unit, directing five shorts before it was closed down, and in 1955 made his return to the Lantz studio, initially to finish some cartoons that Tex Avery had produced during a brief stint as director there.AMPAS: Putting Looney in the Toons He carried on directing at the Lantz studio until the end of the decade, at which point he moved over to Hanna-Barbera. There, he worked mainly as a producer and storyboard artist, and often supervised the studio's voice recording sessions. In 1967, Lovy moved to the newly re-opened Warner Bros. cartoon studio, where he created the characters Cool CatToonopedia: Cool Cat and Merlin the Magic Mouse,Toonopedia: Merlin the Magic Mouse in addition to directing cartoons with classic characters Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales. After just over a year at Warner Bros., Lovy returned to Hanna-Barbera, and worked there in various capacities until shortly before his death. According to Walter Lantz, Lovy was ambidextrous, and could draw two storyboards at the same time, one with each hand.

Family and Education Thomas Jeremiah Williams was the eldest son of William Williams who was Liberal Member of Parliament for the Swansea District from 1893–1895. He was educated at University College School, London, Sheffield Technical College and Firth College. In 1912, he married Laura Alice Marlow of Southport. They had one daughter Gwenith Alice Thomas (née Williams) 22/10/1913 - 11/01/2008. Career Williams was involved in technical and commercial training. He was director of a number of companies, principally in the tinplate industry but also with interests in the colliery and railway sectors. He qualified for the law, practising at the Bar on the South Wales and Chester Circuit. Politics Williams first stood for Parliament at the 1906 general election as Liberal candidate in the Gower constituency in West Glamorgan. Although Gower had been a Liberal seat and 1906 was a landslide election year for the Liberals, Williams was beaten by 299 votes by an Independent Liberal candidate John Williams in a three-cornered contest with the Unionist, E Holme, in third place. Williams did not contest a seat at either of the general elections of 1910 but was adopted for his father's old seat of Swansea District for a by- election there on 6 February 1915 when the sitting MP, David Brynmor Jones was appointed a judge. He held the seat for the Coalition. Swansea District constituency was abolished in 1918, but Williams was adopted as Coalition Liberal candidate for the new Swansea East seat at the 1918 general election. He won the seat in a straight fight with Labour candidate David Williams. Death Williams died on 12 June 1919 at the young age of 47 years after a long illness from colitis at his home in Maesygwernen Hall near Swansea. In the by-election which his death caused, his seat was held for the Coalition Liberals by David Matthews.

He was known for his maverick and controversial style. His fearless iconoclasm was greatly admired by philosopher Paul Feyerabend. He won the Haitinger Prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1917. BiographyEarly years= Ehrenhaft was born in Vienna to physician Leopold Ehrenhaft and Louise Eggar, the daughter of a Hungarian industrialist. Ehrenhaft earned his doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1903, working on the optical properties of metallic colloids. He subsequently became assistant to Franz S. Exner. =Middle years= In 1907, the reality of atoms was still disputed but Albert Einstein and Marian Smoluchowski had both recently given accounts of Brownian motion in liquids, strongly supporting the atomic theory. Though Theodor Svedberg had made important demonstrations of Brownian motion in colloids, Ehrenhaft extended the work to make observations of particles of silver in air. The greater mean free path of air made for a sterner test of the reality of atoms. Ehrenhaft was awarded the Lieben Prize of the Vienna Academy of Sciences for his work. Ehrenhaft adapted his apparatus to measure the elementary charge and subsequently became involved in a bitter controversy with Robert Millikan, claiming to have measured an electric charge less than that of a single electron, Millikan being passed over for the 1920 Nobel Prize in physics owing to the unresolved nature of the debate. Controversy eventually subsided as more and more physicists were swayed by Millikan's results but even as late as 1940, Albert Einstein wrote: Even while controversy raged on sub-electronic charges, Ehrenhaft made important and substantial contributions to physics including the demonstration of photophoresis and other effects on the interaction of particles with light. Some of these effects have subsequently been explained in terms of existing phenomena, but some still remain poorly understood. He became professor of experimental physics at Vienna in 1920 and was known as a conscientious researcher and effective lecturer though single- minded to the point of absurdity. Albert Einstein was a frequent visitor to his home. Following the Anschluss in 1938, Ehrenhaft emigrated, first to England, then to the U.S. where he became a citizen. =Later years= From the mid-1930s, Ehrenhaft's thinking started to diverge strikingly from the mainstream of physics. He observed many genuinely surprising and reproducible physical phenomena, usually of ultra-microscopic particles near the limits of perception. However, he was all too willing to adopt alternate theories to explain experiments that were beset with interactions and multifactorial cause systems. From the 1940s, Ehrenhaft's views became increasingly extreme and strident, eventually terminating his good friendship with Albert Einstein. He found it impossible to obtain either research funding or even a sympathetic hearing in the U.S. In 1946, he returned to the University of Vienna where he held again his old position until his death. He became increasingly certain that he had observed magnetic monopoles, magnetic currents and magnetolysis, the disassociation of liquids by magnets rather than electric current as in electrolysis. A review of his life work can be found in the Austrian scientific journal \\"Acta physica Austriaca\\", and in the article by Rohatschek on photophoresis (see sources below).

The monastery site and the surrounding village is now a suburb of the city of Kaposvár in southwestern Hungary. History The village was the place of a St Benedict monastery in the Árpád age. Some lands in the village were the private properties of the Genere Győr. In 1256 the members of the Genere Győr had given their Zselicszentjakab family monastery to Pannonhalma Archabbey. In 1328 the Genere Győr (Péter and Miklós, sons of Derzs) and the abbot of Zselicszentjakab changed back the lands of the monastery by the lands of Rábacsécsény at the Pannonhalma Archeabbey. The Somogy County villages suffered great devastation during the Turkish wars, and Zselicszentjakab monastery was also destroyed. Architecture The ruins shows the ground plan of the church building and the monastery. The church had three naves. Architectural comparisons proved the eastern connections of the central space, with four columns. This church belonged to the Eastern Orthodox (Caucasian, Byzantine) tradition, in common with churches in Tarnaszentmária, Feldebrő, Székesfehérvár, and Szekszárd. Ruins of a central spaced chapel can also be found north of the monastery buildings. References *Kumorovitz L.

The station was constructed of local blue lias stone (Binton stone) with brick chimneys. The stone for the station and the goods shed could well have been dug out of the deep cutting next to the station in the direction of Broom junction . There was one platform for the single line which had a passing loop to the west. This connected to a siding to the rear of the station with a carriage dock and a goods shed which included the luxury of a 30 cwt hand-operated crane. , virtually all trace of the line has disappeared, though the buildings remain in private hands and are in very good condition.

Scherer. Christian Missions and Church History, Lutheran School of Theology, Chicago, Illinois) Early life August William Edwins was born August 12, 1871 in Ogden, Boone Co., Iowa. His parents had emigrated from Sweden in 1868 to Swede Valley, Iowa. August was the fourth of eleven children. Due to poverty, at 16, he left home to earn money for his education. He graduated from Augustana Academy (Augustana College), Rock Island, Illinois, as valedictorian of both his college and his seminary classes. His gift as a scholar and affinity for linguistics became important for his missionary career. He graduated from Augustana Seminary in 1902 and was ordained that year at the Synod convention held in Ishpeming, Michigan. His first call was to serve the congregation at Trinity Lutheran Church, Stillwater, Minnesota. It was while serving as a pastor at Trinity that Pastor Edwins was first approached about serving as a missionary in China. In 1904 the China Mission Society (CMS), a group of Augustana members interested in establishing mission work in China, called him to serve as its first missionary to China. He was hesitant, but in 1905, when no one responded to a call for volunteers for the China Mission Society (formed in 1901), Edwins himself volunteered and accepted the Society's call. After one year of language studies, Pastor Edwins, in the company of his Chinese teacher and two Norwegian Lutheran missionaries, set out in the spring of 1906 to explore the possibilities for a CMS field in the Honan province. It proved to be an arduous trip with attacks by angry crowds, military escorts, and revised routes of travel. Pastor and Mrs. Edwins set out for the new mission field in Hsuchang on September 2, 1906. Mission Commissioned for China, Edwins married Alfreda Anderholm and sailed from Seattle, arriving in Shanghai in October 1905. After one year of language studies in the Fancheng district of Xiangfan, Hupeh (Hubei) Province, Pastor Edwins, in the company of his Chinese teacher and two Norwegian Lutheran missionaries, set out in the spring of 1906 to explore the possibilities for a CMS field in the Honan province. It proved to be an arduous trip with attacks by angry crowds, military escorts, and revised routes of travel. Pastor and Mrs. Edwins set out for the new mission field in Hsuchang on September 2, 1906. In consultation with missionaries of the China Inland Mission and others, Edwins was directed to an unoccupied field in central Honan. Moving to Hsu-ch'ang (Xuchang) in 1906, Edwins obtained a foothold in Loyang (Luoyang), Jiaxian, and other strategic centers, where land and property were purchased and groundwork was laid for future expansion. In 1910 the first nine converts were baptized in Xuchang. In addition, he was professor at the Union Theological Seminary in Shekow, near Hankou from 1922 to 1942.The United States in Asia :A Historical Dictionary (David Shavit, New York: Greenwood Press, 1991) Pastor Edwins and the mission started a school in 1909 after requests from local people, but this school closed in 1911 due to inadequacies in the curriculum, faculty, and facilities. Another attempt to open a school occurred in 1913, but this school was discontinued after a year because Pastor Edwins was having to spend many days away from the school supervising building work at the other stations. Final years and death Pastor Edwins' last twenty years in the mission field were spent teaching at the Union Theological Seminary at Hankow. Among other accomplishments, Edwins started a union language school for new missionaries, initiated a Chinese Lutheran church paper, promoted indigenous literature, and taught dogmatics in the Union Lutheran Theological Seminary near Wuhan, Hupeh (Hubei), while also serving as the schools President. In March 1941, due to an increasingly tense political situation in China, Pastor Edwins sent his wife and children home to the United States. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent declaration of war on Japan by the United States, American citizens living in China were interned by the Japanese. Since Shekow, where the seminary was located, was in occupied territory, Pastor Edwins became one of those interned. He was interned by the Japanese shortly after Pearl Harbor. Pastor Edwins and others received word in April 1942 that an exchange of American and Japanese nationals was to take place. On June 5 Pastor Edwins and other internees boarded a Japanese steamer that took them to Shanghai. While in Shanghai, Pastor Edwins suffered a stroke and was placed in the China Inland Hospital. He stayed there until he was transferred to the ship that would take him home. The S.S. Conte Verde left Shanghai on June 29 and on July 2 Pastor Edwins died after suffering another stroke late in the evening. He was buried in the South China sea 160 miles due east of Hanoi on July 3 after a brief service attended by fellow missionaries.

It ran from Waldkirchen to Haidmühle in the Bohemian Forest and had a junction there to the line from Haidmühle to Wallern, run by the former United Bohemian Forest Branch Line company (Vereinigte Böhmerwald-Lokalbahnen). It branched at Waldkirchen from the Passau – Freyung branch line (Ilztalbahn). The line was finally closed in 1994.  History  On 10 August 1904 the Bavarian state government authorised the construction of a 26.9 kilometre long branch from Waldkirchen to the Czech border beyond Haidmühle. It was not expected that the line itself would make a profit; it was built to form a junction with the Bohemian railway network. It was opened on 15 November 1910. As a result of the state treaty agreed with Austria on 22 November 1904 this branch line was given a junction with Bohemia at Haidmühle to the United Bohemian Forest Branch Line company to their branch line from Haidmühle to Schwarzes Kreuz (Czech: Černý Kříž) with junctions to Winterberg (Bohemia) (Vimperk), Prachatitz (Prachatice) and Krummau (Český Krumlov). The station building and goods shed at Haidmühle were used jointly by both railway companies and the customs authorities. The route ran from Waldkirchen initially in an easterly direction to Neureichenau and then northeast towards the border station, gaining 346 m in height. In its early years and after the forced annexation of the Sudetenland through trains ran from Passau to Haidmühle, whilst the Freyung line was given at junction at Waldkirchen. Plans from the Czech side to extend the route again to Haidmühle, in order to build a better connexion there to Bavarian bus services, were scrapped. However, there are currently plans to reactivate the Ilztalbahn, and reinstate a bus link between Waldkirchen and Nove Udoli.  Museum railway  Between Nové Údolí (German: Neuthal) station and the end of the border bridge in Germany there is a railway museum, housed in three old goods wagons and which recounts the history of the line, as well as museum railway, the Pošumavská jižní dráha (PJD), which is described as the shortest international railway in the world. The line is 105 metres long and links Czech and German national territory. It can only be joined in the Czech Republic and the line is not joined to the Czech (ČD) national railway network. A journey down the line takes 24 seconds. Traffic  Due to the low axle load permitted on branch lines, special Bavarian Lokalbahn (branch line) locomotives ran on the line. In particular, for goods trains the Bavarian BB II (later DRG Class 98.7) Mallet locomotives from Bw Passau were used. From the early 1930s to the start of the Second World War four-wheeled diesel railbuses of DRG Class 135 and 137, together with their corresponding trailer cars, also ran to Freyung and Haidmühle. In addition the employment of Bavarian Pt 2/3 (later DRG Class 70.0) locomotives was reported. After the line was refurbished and the track and ballast strengthened, DRG Class 64 locomotives took over the passenger services and DRG Class 81s the goods traffic. Later diesel engines were also used as were Uerdingen railbuses for passenger duties. Closoure and Dismantling  On the imposition of the Iron Curtain a section of the line on the Czech side of the border was remove and the importance of the Waldkirchen – Haidmühle line rapidly waned. Only shuttle services continued and all trains ran from Passau to Freyung. On 26 May 1963 passenger services to Haidmühle were withdrawn. Between Haidmühle and Jandelsbrunn goods traffic ceased on 31 December 1975 and between Jandelsbrunn and Waldkirchen on 1 October 1994. After the tracks were lifted the trackbed was used for the Adalbert Stifter cycle path.

In 1976, Martin Scorsese came up with Taxi Driver, a movie that went on to be viewed as one of the best films ever. Starring Robert De Niro, the movie garnered tremendous critical acclaim and emerged as a cult classic. Over the years many directors have been inspired by its style and the way it went about constructing a psychological study of a man leading a life shrouded by disturbing elements, or rather deconstructing the psychological state of disturbed man finding it difficult to come to terms with his environs. In India, a man called Irshaad made a movie titled Taxi Taxie, casting Amol Palekar in the lead as a taxi driver operating in the metropolis of Mumbai. This movie that came out in 1977 seems to be clearly inspired by the English classic that released a year before. The director/writer has been influenced by the idea of his famous contemporary from the west, and has created a completely different movie and completely different narrative of his own, which is quite unique. Amol Palekar, quite fondly given the moniker \\"Hero\\" by his fellow Mumbai Taxiwallahs, is an honest and diligent worker who spends most of his time on the streets of Mumbai, helping various people move around the city. However, he himself finds it difficult to navigate through certain cobwebs in his mind, which keep pushing him back to his past. His choice of being a taxi driver, despite being well qualified academically, comes as an enigma to his old college friend who he runs into one day. He justifies it by voicing the joys of being constantly with various passengers, who he treats like fellow companions in the journey of life. The profession, thus, is his way of parrying off any chances of falling prey to loneliness. There is also a more romantic reason of him wanting to search for an old flame who he hopes would run into him, if luck is on his side. Thus, all the time his eyes keep searching for that familiar face while he drives through the good and bad wonders of the city. As a part of his routine, Hero chances into a hapless (and kind) prostitute more than once, and forges a friendly relationship with her. He also meets a struggling playback singer who somehow reminds him of his flame who he wants to reconnect with quite badly. There is also a kind Christian landlady with whom he shares a lovely bond. It is through these relationships that Hero's thoughts and conflicts are brought to the fore. The city of Mumbai plays a crucial role in binding the narrative. The recent Aamir Khan film Dhobi Ghat shares some other similarities with this thirty-five- year-old forgotten work. People who have been to Mumbai will find it interesting to see all their favourite places from the town being given prominence in the film (without pushing the main context to the background). The film appears technically sound in spite of the apparent low budget. Cast *Amol Palekar ... Dev / Hero *Zaheera ... Jyoti Sharma *Reena Roy ... Neelam *Rama Vij ... Prostitute *Jalal Agha ...

Early life and legal career McCran was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1875. He was raised in Paterson and was educated in the public schools there. He attended Seton Hall College and graduated in 1896 with a Bachelor of Science degree. He read law in the office of former State Senator William B. Gourley in Paterson and was admitted as an attorney in 1899, becoming a counselor in 1911. He practiced in Gourley's office until 1907 before opening up an office of his own. McCran was elected City Attorney of Paterson in 1907, holding the office until 1912. He became a counselor at law in 1911 and obtained his LL.D. from Seton Hall in 1917. Political career In 1909 McCran was elected as a Republican member of the State Assembly from Passaic County, and he was re-elected in 1911 and 1912. He was named floor leader by the Republican minority in 1911 and the following year, when the Republicans took control of the Assembly, he was made Speaker. While serving as Assembly Speaker, his Secretary was William Wadsworth Evans, who would later represent Passaic County in the State Assembly from 1919 to 1924. Before the expiration of his term, he was nominated by the Republicans of Passaic County for the State Senate. The Progressive Party ran a candidate in the race, splitting the Republican vote, and the Democratic candidate Peter J. McGinnis defeated McCran by a slim margin. In 1915 he ran against McGinnis again and defeated him by a plurality of more than 8,000 votes. In 1917 Senate Republicans named McCran majority leader, and in 1918 he was selected as Senate President. He presided as Acting Governor in the absence of Governor Walter Evans Edge. In 1919 Governor Edge appointed him to the position of Attorney General for a five-year term. On the completion of his term he sought the Republican nomination for Governor in 1925. Despite the backing of Edge (now in the United States Senate) and the regular Republican organization, McCran was defeated for the nomination by Arthur Whitney, who had the support of the Anti-Saloon League. Whitney would go on to be defeated in the general election by Democratic candidate A. Harry Moore. Death In September 1925, three months after losing the arduous gubernatorial primary, McCran died suddenly at his home in Paterson. He was diagnosed with acute indigestion and leakage of the heart. He was survived by his wife, the former Frances C. Martin (married at Passaic, June 1916), and his daughter Frances Abby McCran (born December 15, 1918). ReferencesExternal links * Thomas F.

The film was produced by Sharmila Tagore's secretary, N.S. Kabir, and was co-produced by Sharmila Tagore. Rajesh Khanna's real-life secretary Gurnam Singh played the side kick Bansi to Khanna's character Chetan in this film. The film was critically acclaimed and given four stars by critics upon its release in Bollywood Guide Collections. It was the last film to release with the music director as S.D. Burman. This film was not commercially successful at the time of its release. However, over the years this film has gained a cult following and appreciation from audiences in its screening on television.http://archive.indianexpress.com/Picture-Gallery/fans-remember- rajesh-khanna-on-his-first-death-anniversary/3076-6.html  Plot  The story begins in the Central Jail, where a prisoner (Raza Murad) being hanged in the morning is desperately bewailing his fate. His fears are soothed somewhat by another inmate named Chetan (Rajesh Khanna) who tells him that he is not dying but starting a new life elsewhere in a body free from sin. The concept comforts the prisoner and the jail inmate becomes happy. Chetan has served a 10-year-long sentence for murder and is about to be released early for good behavior. The Jailor (Murad) is curious as to how such an obviously empathetic and honest man such as Chetan has proved to be a murderer as well, and he asks Chetan to explain. Initially, Chetan refuses gently but then starts disclosing his past. Chetan is a penniless poet while Sunita is the daughter of a wealthy man (Kamal Kapoor). Both are very much in love. Chetan's close friend Bansi (Gurnam Singh) thinks Chetan should use his education to get a job to keep the creditors from his door, but Chetan wants to continue writing books and develop his habit of writing stories with Sunita's full support. Sunita fears to talk before her father. Her rich father has the reason for being a stubborn father too and that is that he was a poor man and his wife had died because he could not afford proper medical facilities for her only because he could not afford them and this has made him more ambitious in life. So Sunita's father has throughout his life concentrated more on building his house and earning more money for a secure future, but all this at the cost of a complete disconnect personally between him and Sunita. Sunita's father decides to marry her to Gopal (Dheeraj Kumar), a doctor. Gopal and his mother (Sulochana Latkar) meet Sunita in her house for the first time and they like her. Her dad decides to announce their engagement at the birthday party. Meanwhile, Sunita urges Chetan to ask her hand from her father on her birthday and she invites him for that party. At the party her father is rude to Chetan and then announces her engagement to Gopal—she swallows her anger in order to maintain a good front before the guests, but later goes in search of Chetan at his home. Sunita tells Chetan that they should elope and go far away from her parents and live in a separate world of their own. Chetan asks why should they elope, instead they should go together to her father and tell him that they want to marry and that Chetan will take care of Sunita. Sunita does agree with him, but tells Chetan that this idea of his won't help as her father may attack or kill Chetan. To this, Chetan replies that its completely unethical to run away from problems and in this case, from her father as it would bring dishonour to Sunita and even to their own love story. Chetan promises that were her father to refuse to give his permission, they would marry anyway. So Chetan advises her to go back home and that Chetan would marry her after trying to convince her father. Chetan points out that society will disapprove and she might regret it someday. To this, Sunita declares that Chetan is cowardly and selfish and does not want to share a bit of sorrow that her parents did not approve of their relation and wouldn't take a risk by running away and starting a life together, when she left her wealth and family and came to him. Sunita says she did not think of anything except her love for Chetan and came running with her belongings to Chetan's house. That shows she is selfless in this love affair. So by this logic, she tells Chetan that she would now marry Gopal only as Chetan has belittled their love and her ability to make a choice. Sunita marries Gopal and they live happily, but one day, she discloses to her husband that she was in love with a person in her college days. Gopal gets angry and hurt so starts drinking wine and confides his problem to a friend in the Mahinder bar and goes off to England for years to further his medical studies, abandoning Sunita to bring up their son Munna (Master Tito) and take care of his mother. Chetan, meanwhile, channels his despair into writing and becomes critically renowned and popular; one of his biggest fans is Sunita's mother-in-law. His greatest work is a novel called Tyaag—the story of his romance with Sunita. Five years pass after Sunita's marriage and Gopal decides to return to India as he by now realises that Sunita is a good mother and a good daughter-in-law and so decides to mend their married life. Sunit's child then runs away from home in search of his father and boards a train. There, he meets a passenger and he turns out to be Chetan. Chetan realises that the child is innocent and decides to lodge a police complaint. On this, the child being smart and hyperactive, decides to run away from him. But Chetan catches him and promises to him to take him to England. Munna agrees to go home now, provided that Chetan takes him home. Sunita gets angry on seeing Chetan. She tries her best to throw him out of her life. The rest of the story is about the dilemma which Sunita faces. Will Chetan avenge his failed love affair with her in the past by destroying her present married life? Will Chetan avail of the opportunity of Gopal's absence to molest her? Is Chetan really in love with her child? What will happen to her life when her husband returns?

It serves the Minnesota Valley Transit Authority bus system and the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit system. It opened March 20, 2010 in the Cedar Grove community. The station was built adjacent to Cedar Avenue freeway (Minnesota State Highway 77), but there was not any direct access from the freeway to the station for buses. Buses had to exit the freeway at Diffley Road, travel up Nicols Road to the station, pick up passengers, then double back along Nicols Road and Diffley Road to get back on the freeway, a maneuver that added five to ten minutes for each trip. New \\"in- line\\" access was designed with a station platform in the freeway median and a pedestrian bridge connecting it to the original station area. The platform layout bears a similarity to the 46th Street station on Interstate 35W in Minneapolis, which is about 11 miles north via the highway. Buses perform a \\"crossover\\" maneuver to have left-hand running around the platform, which is necessary since Red Line buses only have doors on the right-hand side. A groundbreaking ceremony for the $15 million station upgrade was held on April 28, 2016, which opened on May 20th, 2017.https://patch.com/minnesota/applevalley-rosemount/new-cedar-grove- transit-station-opens-south-metro Bus connections Station notes = Route 438 operates on-demand service to Blackhawk Park & Ride (for connections to Route 480).

Clearly the temples were not built simply as acts of piety but as ways of protecting estate income and a certain style of life. Evidently the building of new temples could serve as a coercive device to extract support from other kuge families and to justify the use of public taxes for the benefit of members of the imperial-house, the religious intent giving support to the political interest.Hall, John et al.

The film stars Anil Dhawan.  Plot  Thakur Pratap Singh has lost his beloved ones due to a curse put on him and his family by a widow, whose son Dharma (Rakesh Pandey) was unintentionally killed by Pratap Singh long back. Now Pratap Singh is on death bed tended by his extremely loyal servant Shankar. Pratap Singh calls his friend Professor to his Haveli and asks him to take his son Suraj to one of his friends (Krishan Dhawan) in Mumbai. Moments later we see that Thakur dies and the Professor and his charioteer Shambhu Kaka (Kumud Tripathi) are attacked by a gruesome, ghastly, vengeful deformed ghoul. With much valor Shambhu Kaka saves Suraj and scrams, but Professor, not so lucky, dies a macabre death. Time goes by and now Suraj (Anil Dhawan) has grown up andy is in love with his uncle's (Krishna Dhawan) daughter Rachna (Shamlee). After few romantic sequences they get married. However, not everything goes on suavely as Suraj is tormented by the haunting memories of past. He decides to take matter in his hands and heads to the Haveli with Rachna. On the way they encounter an old woman, who scorns Suraj's decision of going to the Haveli. She tells him that her son Ganga (Satyen Kappu), once a popular village lad, lost his life in the caves behind the Haveli. Suraj dismisses her story and takes his way to the Haveli. Ahead they meet some hoodlums who try to take advantage of Rachna's solitariness, while Suraj is out to bring water for the fuming car radiator. Suraj arrives just in time and saves Rachna. They are then aided by a local village girl Shaila (Sheetal), who is the jovial daughter of the village headman or Sardar (D.K. Sapru). That night, during their halt, Rachna is attacked by the monster, who topples their car and disappears in dark. Suraj goes looking for it when he lands up at the Haveli and finds Shankar cleaning bloodstains dotted on the floor. Rachna somehow manages to save her life and soon joins Suraj at the Haveli. Upon arrival, Suraj is given a warm welcome by the villagers. Sardar tells Suraj that Pratap Singh was his old buddy and laments his death. The village extremists Shakal, younger brother of Dharma, and Goga (Shakti Kapoor) dislike the friendly attitude of Sardar towards Suraj and arouse Suraj for a fight. A violent duel ensues between Shakal and Suraj with Suraj's decisive victory. Meanwhile, Rachna happens to discover Shambhu Kaka's corpse and takes to her heels to tell Suraj. However, when they return the dead body is nowhere to be seen. Shakal wants to settle scores with Suraj (for Pratap Singh's atrocities) for the untimely death of his brother Dharma and his mother. His wife Reshma (Anju Mahendru) tries to persuade Shakal to leave the dog-eat-dog attitude but Shakal is blinded by revenge and believes that killing Suraj would do justice to the souls of his deceased mother and brother. At night Reshma goes to the Haveli to make Suraj understand about the impending peril he and Rachna could face. At the Haveli she finds Shankar sneaking out of a hidden door. With much curiosity Reshma opens the door (unbeknownst to anyone else) and finds that the door opens to a dungeon. Several minutes later, we see Reshma dead and Shankar digging a grave for her. Afterwards Shakal finds Reshma's bracelet on a near the grave and Goga blames Suraj for her death. Enraged Shakal kills Shaila as he does not want the Sardar to know about Reshma's death. Meanwhile, Goga and his men raid the Haveli and torment Rachna. Rachna somehow escapes but ends up at the dungeon. Goga and his men are killed by the monster and Rachna witnesses their horrendous deaths. Suraj and the village men reach dungeon and find a scared Rachna and the dead bodies of Goga and his henchmen. They also see a cloaked figure who is revealed to be none other than Pratap Singh. Suraj takes Pratap Singh to the Haveli and it looks like Pratap Singh is living a vegetable life after having lost his memory, eyesight and hearing ability. Shakal frames Suraj and his father by showing Shaila's corpse to Sardar and puts the blame on them. Sardar orders Shakal to kill the culprits and Shakal thus gets a chance to quench his blood thirst. With several villagers, Shakal goes to the Haveli and demands an eye-for-an-eye and tooth- for-a-tooth justice. Finally Shakal breaks into the Haveli and ends up in Pratap Singh's room. Where he starts whipping Pratap Singh only to find out that Pratap Singh is the monster. The monster throws Shakal out of the window killing him and also kills Shankar in front of Suraj and Rachna. While dying Shakar informs Suraj that the Trident in the temple of Kaali Mata is the only way to stop the monster. Suraj and Rachna somehow manage to move out of the Haveli but are stopped by the villagers waiting outside it. Meanwhile, the monster comes out of the Haveli and the villagers who are surrounding the Haveli start running towards the temple. The monster tries killing the Sardar in the temple when Suraj kills the monster with the trident (Trishul). The ceiling of the temple collapses on the monster who returns to his human form before dying. Suraj and all the villagers come to know that the monster was none other than Thakur Pratap Singh. Holding his last breath Pratap Singh reveals that due to his evil deeds the curse turned him into the monster and that is the reason why he did not want his son to be here. The movie ends with Thakur dying in Suraj's arm.

The park covers about 100 hectares - approximately . There are a variety of natural habitats within the park, including mudflats and salt marsh, ponds and reed-beds, grassland and scrub, which provide a haven for wildlife. History The coastline of Gillingham has had a rich and varied past The park was established in the 1970s by Medway Council and takes in the various areas; of Motney Hill, Rainham Dock, Bloors Wharf, Horrid Hill, Sharp's Green Bay and Eastcourt Meadows. =Rainham Docks and Motney Hill= The earliest known occupation of the area was in the Neolithic times according to archaeological evidence found around the Rainham Docks area. This was later used by the Romans as a burial site.http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/02_02_09_rcp_management_plan_green_flag-2.pdf Like most of Medway, the fertile area was then a major site of hops, cherries, plums and apple orchards and wheat fields. In 1819, Motney Hill appears on maps as an island. Because of its large sand deposits it was also known as 'Gritty Island'. In 1901, the British Standard Cement Company started chalk extraction http://www.kentfallen.com/PDF%20REPORTS/RAINHAM%20CEMENT%20WORKS.pdf to London. The chalk came from a large pit, now known as Berengrave Local Nature Reserve A cement works was then established on Motney Hill island in 1912. During high tides, barges sailed into the river near the docks, then workers known as 'Muddies' collected mud from the riverbed and loaded it onto the barges. As the tide came back in, the barges would re-float and sail to Rainham Dock, where the mud would be mixed with chalk and fired at high temperatures to produce cement. Barges then sailed from Rainham Dock East loaded with cement and flints. These were used in the construction of roads and buildings. The barges would return with coal (for firing the cement work kilns ) and timber for the local industry and making staves (timber slats used for making barrels). The barrels were then used to transport the cement. The cement factory closed in the 1930s, and soon after the buildings were dismantled. The dockside still remains.http://www.friendsofberengrave.btik.com/Berengrave%20LNR/What%20is%20Berengrave%20LNR The chalk pit also closed in 1931 after the cement factory. Motney Hill has also been known as Motley Hill on some old maps.http://www.fadedgenes.co.uk/HerbertHODGES.html In 1923, a pumping station and sewerage installations were built on Motney Hill. It began processing waste from Rochester and Chatham, and then later Gillingham. Over the years, the works have been modernised and now it handles over 10 million gallons of effluent each day. =Bloors Wharf= Bloors Wharf, Motney Hill is in the background From 1869, maps began to show a small quay. It started as a fisherman's wharf, then had warehouses and was finally a scrap yard and ship breaker's site,Bloors Wharf Hulk Assemblage The buildings on the wharf have been cleared and it is now an empty abandoned space with a concrete seawall and steel fence.http://www.medway.gov.uk/leisureandculture/walking/riversidetorainhamdockwalk.aspx =Horrid Hill= Causeway to Horrid Hill The ruins of the cement works at Horrid Hill In the 1860s, Alfred Castle used to moor his vessels in Sharp's Green Bay (see more later), to collect chalk from a nearby quarry in Twydall, before heading across the water to his two cement works on Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey. The chalk was carted to the barges from the quarry, then the barges would be loaded at low tide, as the draught (draft (hull) of the vessel would require more water under the keel to float off the mud. Due to tidal constraints, the barges were loaded by hand. Castle later built a wooden jetty further down the channel leading to a small peninsula in the river. This then allowed the barges to load at high and low tides. Later, to improve the speed of loading, he built a narrow gauge horse-drawn railway from the quarry to the new wooden jetty. Trucks on the railway had side-tippers, so could just tip their loads into the barges. The chalk was then transported to Queenborough via seven barges, owned by Alfred and his brother James. The works produced 400 tons of cement a week. In 1890, Joseph Wilders and Franic Joseph Carey were searching for a coastal site of their own cement works. An agreement was made with Alfred Castle to use the eastern side of the peninsula. The new works required some land reclamation, by constructing an extension to the existing causeway and extending the railway out to the works on the island.http://www.kenthistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=7002.0;wap2 It was one of the smallest cement works on record. A wharf of timber and concrete was also built to enable barges to unload coke and clay. When the works were fully operational, Carey and Wilders employed a minimum of men who were on a shift system. It was a very bleak place to work, especially during the winter months. It gained the nickname Horrid Hill The cement works closed in 1910, but chalk was still quarried and supplied the cement works in Queenborough for many years. The last vessel to berth there was a barge, the \\"Dick Turpin\\", which subsequently ran aground in the estuary off Horrid Hill in 1913. Some of its cargo of Dundee marmalade jars can still be recovered in the River Medway. =Sharp's Green Bay= Looking across Sharp's Green Bay to Kingsnorth Power Station Closer to the visitor centre is Sharp's Green Pond, a small freshwater pond inside the clay sea wall, which is used to promote a diversity of wildlife within the park. Sharp's Green Bay (left of Horrid Hill causeway) is a small tidal marsh bay where a few houseboats are moored.http://www.songofthepaddle.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?18193-Tidal- Medway-Launch-Sites A small car park is on the bay, from a narrow access road from Lower Rainham Road. Copperhouse Marshes are salt marshes, so named after the copperas works in nearby Gillingham. Copperas (or Iron(II) sulfate) was used as a dye for woollen cloth and for tanning, made by steeping iron pyrites in wooden vats for about six years and then boiling off the liquid. After evaporation the crystals of the dye were formed. There were Copperas factories in Queenborough in the 16th century and at Whitstable. =Eastcourt Meadows and country park creation= In 1928, Rainham became part of Gillingham Borough. This former farmland was then used by the council to tip rubbish. This was stopped in the 1950s and is now left as a wild meadow land.http://www.medway.gov.uk/leisureandculture/walking/eastcourtmeadowswalk.aspx In 1987, the expanded Riverside Country Park officially opened, (after the initial opening in the 1970s) followed by designation of the land north of the B2004 as a country park under the Countryside Act 1968. In 1997, Medway Council began purchasing areas of land for inclusion in Riverside Country Park, including Eastcourt Wood, Marsh Field, Mariner’s Field, Bloors Wharf, Bloors Field, and Motney Field. Work was then started to remove buildings, scrap and pollution from Bloors Wharf for the new park. Facilities Saxon Shore Way heading towards Motney Hill This park is maintained by Medway Council.medway.gov.uk It has a visitor centre (with cafe, toilets and information point) in the main car park, along Lower Rainham Road. The Saxon Shore Way (long distance path) leads along the coast through the park, between Upchurch and Gillingham. National Cycle Route 1 leads along the Saxon Shore Way through the park as well. The park offers good and accessible viewpoints to look out over the North Kent Marshes beside the River Medway. The park also is acreddited with a Green Flag Award by Natural England. Motney Hill (is now an RSPB reserve on a headland sticking out into the River Medway) http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/n/normarsh/index.aspx Berengrave Local Nature Reserve http://www.medway.gov.uk/environmentandplanning/countrysidesites/riversidecountrypark/berengravenaturereserve.aspx covers an area of approximately 15 hectares (37 acres). Most of it covers the former site of the Cement Works of Rainham Docks. The estuary has special protection as part of the Medway Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), as defined by English Nature.http://www.english- nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000244.pdf and is internationally important for wintering birds that thrive on the invertebrate-rich mudflats, including many species of waders, ducks and geese. The salt marshes have a specialised ecology and act as high tide roost sites. Eastcourt Meadows Country Park is mistakenly shown on page 119 of the AA Illustrated Guide to the Coast. Also Camer Park Country Park is shown but no text on either park. Location From the A2 London Road in Rainham. Follow the B2004 Lower Rainham Road towards Gillingham. The country park has two car parks, one with the visitor centre near Sharp's Green Bay and Horrid Hill. The other is near Motney Hill and Bloors Wharf.

The movement promotes a revival of classical art and a greater commitment to science; advocates the development of major economic infrastructure projects on a global scale; and calls for a reform of the world financial system to encourage investment in the physical economy and suppress financial speculation. The movement originated within the radical leftist student politics of the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of candidates, some with only limited knowledge or connection to LaRouche or the movement, ran as Democrats in the United States on the LaRouche platform.King 1989, pp. 132–133. In 1988, LaRouche and 25 associates were convicted on fraud charges related to fund-raising. The movement called the prosecutions politically motivated. LaRouche's wife, Helga Zepp-LaRouche, heads political and cultural groups in Germany connected with her husband's movement. There are also parties in France, Sweden and other European countries and branches or affiliates in Australia, Canada, the Philippines and several Latin American countries. Estimates of the movement range from five hundred to one thousand members in the United States, spread across more than a dozen cities, and about the same number abroad. Members engage in political organizing, fund- raising, cultural events, research and writing and internal meetings. The movement has had a number of notable members. Cultural, economic and scientific initiatives *Restoration of Glass-Steagall. Since 2007, the movement has actively campaigned to restore the Glass-Steagall Act, to separate commercial banking from speculative investment banking, protecting the former and not bailing out the latter. *New Bretton Woods. Advocates the abandonment of floating exchange rates and the return to Bretton Woods-style fixed rates, with gold, or an equivalent, used as under the gold-reserve system. This is not to be confused with the gold standard, which LaRouche did not support. *American System. Espouses a new \\"American System\\" of federalized infrastructure projects and national banks and regulation. Named for the historical American System of Henry Clay, but owing more to the ideas of the expansive American School. *Eurasian Land Bridge. Lectures and writes on behalf of a \\"Eurasian land-bridge\\", a massive high-speed maglev railway project to span continents and re-invigorate industry and commerce. *Scientific pitch. Argues in favor of what they call \\"Verdi tuning\\" in classical music, in which A=432 Hz, as opposed to the common practice today of tuning to A=440 Hz. *Mars colonization. Recommends colonization of the planet Mars, on similar basis as many others in the field, that human survivability depends on territorial diversification. *Strategic Defense Initiative. Supported directed beam weapons for use against ICBMs, and claims credit as the first to propose this to Ronald Reagan. LaRouche did not support rocket- based defensive systems such as anti-ballistic missiles. Political organizations LaRouche-affiliated political parties have nominated many hundreds of candidates for national and regional offices in the U.S., Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Australia and France, for almost thirty years. In countries outside the U.S., the LaRouche movement maintains its own minor parties, and they have had no significant electoral success to date. In the U.S., individuals associated with the movement have successfully sought Democratic Party office in some elections, particularly Democratic County Central Committee posts, and been nominated for state and federal office as Democrats, although the party leadership has periodically voiced its disapproval. =International= The Schiller Institute and the International Caucus of Labor Committees (ICLC) are international organizations associated by some with the LaRouche Movement. Schiller Institute conferences have been held across the world. The ICLC is affiliated to political parties in France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Denmark, Sweden, Mexico, the Philippines, and several South American countries. Lyndon LaRouche, who is based in Loudoun County, Virginia, United States, and his wife, Helga Zepp- LaRouche, based in Wiesbaden, Germany, regularly attend these international conferences and have met foreign politicians, bureaucrats, and academics. According to London-based SciDev.Net, the LaRouche movement has \\"attracted suspicion for circulating conspiracy theories and advocating for grand infrastructure projects.\\" The movement supports the Transaqua project to divert water from the Congo River to replenish Lake Chad.\\"Three major canal schemes criticised over use of science\\" , SciDev.Net, April 22, 2015 =United States=Political activities LaRouche supporter in Washington, D.C., 2005 LaRouche ran for U.S. president eight times, in every presidential election from 1976 to 2004. The first was with the U.S. Labor Party. In the next seven campaigns he ran for the Democratic Party nomination. He received federal matching funds in 2004. See Lyndon LaRouche U.S. Presidential campaigns. The LaRouche movement attracted media attention in the context of the 1986 Illinois gubernatorial election, when movement members Janice Hart and Mark J. Fairchild won the Democratic Primary elections for the offices of Illinois Secretary of State and Illinois Lieutenant Governor respectively. Until the day after the primary, major media outlets were reporting that George Sangmeister, Fairchild's primary opponent, was running unopposed. More than 2 decades later, Fairchild asked, \\"how is it possible that the major media, with all of their access to information, could possibly be mistaken in that way?\\" Democratic gubernatorial candidate Adlai Stevenson III was favored to win this election, having lost the previous election by a narrow margin. He refused to run on the same slate with Hart and Fairchild, forming the Solidarity Party and running with Jane Spirgel as the Secretary of State nominee. Hart and Spirgel's opponent, Republican incumbent Jim Edgar, won the election with 1.574 million votes. After that primary Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) accused his own party of pursuing a policy of ignoring the \\"infiltration by the neo-Nazi elements of Lyndon H. LaRouche\\", and said that too often, especially in the media, \\"the LaRouchites\\" are \\"dismissed as kooks.\\" \\"In an age of ideology, in an age of totalitarianism, it will not suffice for a political party to be indifferent to and ignorant about such a movement\\", said Moynihan.See also, Moynihan had faced a primary challenge in 1982 from Mel Klenetsky, an associate of LaRouche. In 1986 the LaRouche movement worked to place an AIDS initiative, Proposition 64, on the California ballot, which lost by a 4–1 margin. It was re-introduced in 1988 and lost again by the same margin. Federal and state officials raided movement offices in 1986. In the ensuing trials, some leaders of the movement received prison terms for conspiracy to commit fraud, mail fraud, and tax evasion. In 1988, Claude Jones won the chairmanship of the Harris County Democratic Party in Houston, and was stripped of his authority by the county executive committee before he could take office. He was removed from office by the state party chairman a few months later, in February 1989, because of Jones's alleged opposition to the Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis, in favor of LaRouche. The LaRouche movement opposed the UN sanctions against Iraq in 1991 and the Gulf War in 1991. Supporters formed the \\"Committee to Save the Children in Iraq\\". LaRouche blamed the sanctions and war on \\"Israeli- controlled Moslem fundamentalist groups\\" and the \\"Ariel Sharon-dominated government of Israel\\" whose policies were \\"dictated by Kissinger and company, through the Hollinger Corporation, which has taken over The Jerusalem Post for that purpose.\\" Left-wing anti-war groups were divided over the LaRouche movement's involvement. In 2000, the Democratic Senatorial nominee in Wyoming, Mel Logan, was a LaRouche follower; the Republican incumbent, Craig Thomas, won in a 76–23% landslide. In 2001, a \\"national citizen-candidates' movement\\" was created, advancing candidates for a number of elective offices across the country. In 2006, LaRouche Youth Movement activist and Los Angeles County Democratic Central Committee member Cody Jones was honored as \\"Democrat of the Year\\" for the 43rd Assembly District of California, by the Los Angeles County Democratic Party. At the April 2007 California State Democratic Convention, LYM activist Quincy O'Neal was elected vice-chairman of the California State Democratic Black Caucus, and Wynneal Innocentes was elected corresponding secretary of the Filipino Caucus. In November 2007, Mark Fairchild returned to Illinois to promote legislation authored by LaRouche, called the \\"Homeowners and Bank Protection Act of 2007\\", establishing a moratorium on home foreclosures and establishing a new federal agency to oversee all federal and state banks. He also promoted LaRouche's plan to build a high-speed railroad to connect Russia and the United States, including a tunnel under the Bering Strait.\\"LaRouche follower returns to Capitol\\" The State Journal-Register, November 2, 2007, archived on January 25, 2008 from the original In 2009, a volunteer table in Mattituck, New York had a picture of Obama with a \\"drawn-in Hitler moustache\\" and \\"a picture of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi with Frankenstein-style bolts in her head.\\"Schultz, Erin, \\"Obama's plan blasted as Nazi-like \\", Suffolk Times, 23 July 2009.

Alameel. Controversy The LaRouche movement has been accused of violence, harassment, and heckling since the 1970s.Springston (1986) =1960s and Operation Mop-Up= In the 1960s and 1970s, LaRouche was accused of fomenting violence at anti-war rallies with a small band of followers. According to LaRouche's autobiography, it was in 1969 that violent altercations began between his members and New Left groups. He wrote that a faction of Students for a Democratic Society which later became the Weathermen began assaulting LaRouche's faction at Columbia University, and there were later attacks by the Communist Party, and the SWP. These conflicts culminated in \\"Operation Mop-Up\\", a series of physical attacks by LaRouche's National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC) on rival left-wing groups. LaRouche's New Solidarity reported NCLC confrontations with members of the Communist Party and Socialist Workers Party, including an April 23, 1973 incident at a debate featuring Labor Committee mayoral candidate Tony Chaitkin that erupted in a brawl, with chairs flying. Six people were treated for injuries at a local hospital. In the mid-1973 the movement formed a \\"Revolutionary Youth Movement\\" to recruit and politicize members of street gangs in New York City and other eastern cities.\\"Marx & the Outlaws Recruiting in the ghetto\\" Howard Blum, The Village Voice, New York, June 6, 1974King 1989, pp. 33–34. The NCLC allegedly trained some members in terrorist and guerrilla warfare.Blum & Montgomery (1979) Topics included weapons handling, explosives and demolition, close order drills, small unit tactics, and military history. =The USLP vs. the FBI= A 1973 internal FBI letter recommended that the FBI provide anonymous aid to a background investigation by the Communist Party USA. Internal FBI memo from 1975 warning about harassment of agents by NCLC members In November 1973, the FBI issued an internal memorandum, later released under the Freedom of Information Act. Jeffrey Steinberg, the NCLC \\"director of counterintelligence\\", described it as the \\"COINTELPRO memo\\", which he says showed \\"that the FBI was considering supporting an assassination attempt against LaRouche by the Communist Party USA.\\" LaRouche wrote in 1998: The FBI was allegedly concerned that the movement might try to take power by force. FBI Director Clarence Kelly testified in 1976 about the LaRouche movement: =Association with Roy Frankhouser and Mitch WerBell= In the later 1970s, the U.S. Labor Party came into contact with Roy Frankhouser, a felon and government informant who had infiltrated a variety of groups. The LaRouche organization believed Frankhouser was a federal agent assigned to infiltrate right-wing and left-wing groups, and that he had evidence that these groups were being manipulated or controlled by the FBI and other agencies. Frankhouser introduced LaRouche to Mitchell WerBell III, a former Office of Strategic Services operative, paramilitary trainer, and arms dealer. Some members allegedly took a six-day \\"anti-terrorist\\" course a training camp operated by WerBell in Powder Springs, Georgia. In 1979, LaRouche denied that the training sessions took place. WerBell introduced LaRouche to covert operations specialist General John K. Singlaub, who later said that members of the movement implied in discussions with him that the military might help \\"lead the country out of its problems\\", a view which he rejected. WerBell also introduced LaRouche to Larry Cooper, a Powder Springs, Georgia police captain. Cooper, Frankhouser and an associate of Frankhouser named Forrest Lee Fick later made allegations about LaRouche. Cooper said in an NBC broadcast interview in 1984 that LaRouche had proposed the assassination of Jimmy Carter, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Joseph Luns, and David Rockefeller. In 1984, LaRouche said that he had employed WerBell as a security consultant, but that the allegations coming from Werbell's circle were fabrications that originated with operatives of the FBI and other agencies. =Labor unions= In 1974 and 1975, the NCLC allegedly targeted the United Auto Workers (UAW), United Farm Workers (UFW), and other trade unionists. They dubbed their campaign \\"Operation Mop Up Woodcock\\", a reference to their anti-communist campaign of 1973 and to UAW president Leonard Woodcock. The movement staged demonstrations that allegedly turned violent. They issued pamphlets attacking the leadership as corrupt and perverted. The UAW said that members had received dozens of calls a day accusing their relatives of homosexuality,Business Week. \\"The U.S. Labor Party's radical crusade\\". October 2, 1978. reportedly at the direction of NCLC \\"security staff\\". Leaflets called an Ohio local president a \\"Woodcocksucker\\". The leadership of the AFL-CIO was also attacked. During the same period, the LaRouche movement was closely associated with the Teamsters union which was in a jurisdictional dispute with the UFW. =1980 New Hampshire presidential primary= LaRouche put substantial effort into his first Democratic Primary, held February 1980 in New Hampshire. Reporters, campaign workers, and party officials received calls from people impersonating reporters or ADL staff members, inquiring what \\"bad news\\" they had heard about LaRouche. LaRouche acknowledged that his campaign workers used impersonation to collect information on political opponents. Governor Hugh Gallen, State Attorney General Thomas Rath and other officials received harassing phone calls. Their names appeared on a photocopied \\"New Hampshire Target List\\" acquired by the Associated Press, found in a LaRouche campaign worker's hotel room; the list stated, \\"these are the criminals to burn – we want calls coming in to these fellows day and night\\". LaRouche spokesman Ted Andromidas said, \\"We did choose to target those people for political pressure hopefully to prevent them from carrying out the kind of fraud that occurred in Tuesday's election.\\" New Hampshire journalist Jon Prestage said he was threatened after a tense interview with LaRouche and his associates, and found several of his cats dead after he published an account of the meeting. A LaRouche associate denied responsibility for the dead cats. =Political opponents= According to courtroom testimony by FBI agent Richard Egan, Jeffrey and Michelle Steinberg, the heads of LaRouche's security unit, boasted of placing harassing phone calls all through the night to the general counsel of the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) when the FEC was investigating LaRouche's political contributions. During the grand jury hearings followers picketed the courthouse, chanted \\"Weld is a fag\\", distributed leaflets accusing Weld of involvement in drug dealing, and \\"sang a jingle advocating that he be hanged in public\\".\\"Indictment says LaRouche wanted to smear official to block probe\\", Houston Chronicle December 17, 1986, p. 14 The Schiller Institute sent a team of ten people, headed by James Bevel, to Omaha, Nebraska, to pursue the Franklin child prostitution ring allegations in 1990. Among the charges investigated by the grand jury was that the Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadman and other men had sex with a 15-year-old girl at a party held by the bank's owner. The LaRouche groups insisted there was a cover-up. They distributed copies of the Schiller Institute's New Federalist newspaper and went door-to- door in Wadman's neighborhood, telling residents he was a child molester. When Wadman took a job with the police department in Aurora, Illinois, LaRouche followers went there to demand he be fired, and after he left there followed him to a third city to make accusations. In the 1970s, Nelson Rockefeller was a central figure in the movement's theories. An FBI file described them as a \\"clandestinely oriented group of political schizophrenics who have a paranoid preoccupation with Nelson Rockefeller and the CIA.\\" The movement strongly opposed Rockefeller's nomination for U.S. vice president and heckled his appearances. Federal authorities were reportedly concerned that the situation might turn violent. One target of LaRouche's attention has been Henry Kissinger. LaRouche allegedly has called Kissinger a \\"faggot\\", a \\"traitor\\", a British or Soviet agent and a \\"Nazi\\", and has linked him to the murder of Aldo Moro.King (1989) His followers heckled and disrupted Kissinger's appearances. In 1982, a member of LaRouche's Fusion Energy Foundation, Ellen Kaplan, asked Kissinger at an airport terminal if it were true that he slept with young boys; Kissinger and his wife, Nancy, were on their way to a heart operation. In response, Nancy Kissinger grabbed the woman by the throat. Kaplan pressed charges and the case went to trial. In 1986 Janice Hart held a press conference to say that Kissinger was part of the international \\"drug mafia\\". Asked whether Jews were behind drug trafficking Hart replied, \\"That's totally nonsense. I don't consider Henry Kissinger a Jew. I consider Henry Kissinger a homosexual.\\" A LaRouche organization sold posters of Illinois politician Jane Byrne described by Mike Royko as \\"border(ing) on the pornographic.\\" In 1986, two LaRouche candidates, Janice Hart and Mark Fairchild, won in the Democratic primaries for two statewide positions in Illinois, Secretary of State and Lieutenant Governor. Campaign appearances by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Adlai Stevenson III, who refused to share the ticket with them and shifted instead to the \\"Solidarity Party\\" formed for the purpose, were interrupted by a trio of singers that included Fairchild and Chicago Mayoral candidate Sheila Jones. Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan's home was visited late at night by a group of LaRouche followers who chanted, sang, and used a bullhorn \\"to exorcise the demons out of Neil Hartigan's soul\\". Before the primaries a group of LaRouche supporters reportedly stormed the campaign offices of Hart's opponent and demanded that a worker \\"take an AIDS test\\". In 1984 a reporter for a LaRouche publication buttonholed President Ronald Reagan as he was leaving a White House press conference, demanding to know why LaRouche was not receiving Secret Service protection. As a result, future press conferences in the East Room were arranged with the door behind the president so he can leave without passing through the reporters. In 1992, a follower shook hands with President George H. W. Bush at a campaign visit to a shopping center. The follower would not let go, demanding to know, \\"When are you going to let LaRouche out of jail?\\" The Secret Service had to intervene. During the 1988 presidential campaign, LaRouche activists spread a rumor that the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, had received professional treatment for two episodes of mental depression. Media sources did not report the rumor initially to avoid validating it. However at a press conference a reporter for a LaRouche publication, Nicholas Benton, asked President Reagan whether Dukakis should release his medical records. Reagan replied \\"Look, I'm not going to pick on an invalid.\\" Within an hour after the press conference Reagan apologized for the joke. The question received wide publicity, and was later analyzed as an example of how journalists should handle rumors. Republican candidate Vice President George H.W. Bush's aides got involved in sustaining the story, and Dukakis was obliged to deny having had depression. To avoid the negative backlash on his own campaign, Bush made a statement urging Congress to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act, which he signed upon gaining office and which became one of his proudest legacies.Co At a 2003 Democratic primary debate repeatedly interrupted by hecklers, Joe Lieberman quoted John McCain, \\"no one's been elected since 1972 that Lyndon LaRouche and his people have not protested\\". The first reported incidence of heckling by LaRouche followers was at the Watergate hearings in 1973. Since then, LaRouche followers have repeatedly disrupted speaking events and debates featuring a large variety of speakers. =Conflict with journalists= In the 1980s, journalists including Joe Klein and Chuck Fager from Boston's alternative weekly, The Real Paper, and Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko alleged harassment and intimidation by LaRouche groups. After Royko wrote about a LaRouche organization, Royko said that leaflets appeared, alleging he had had a sex-change operation. He also said his assistant found a note with a bullseye and a threat to kill her cat on her door; Also according to Royko, LaRouche supporters picketed the newspaper offices, calling Royko a \\"degenerate drug pusher\\" and demanding he take an AIDS test. LaRouche supporters denied such charges, saying they were part of a campaign against them by the \\"drug lobby.\\" In 1984, Patricia Lynch co-produced an NBC news piece and a TV documentary on LaRouche. She was then impersonated by LaRouche followers who interfered with her reporting. LaRouche sued Lynch and NBC for libel, and NBC countersued. During the trial followers picketed the NBC's offices with signs that said \\"Lynch Pat Lynch\\", and the NBC switchboard received a death threat. A LaRouche spokesman said they had no knowledge of the death threat. An editor of the Centre Daily Times in State College, Pennsylvania reported that a LaRouche TV crew led by Stanley Ezrol talked their way into his house in 1985 implying they were with NBC, then accused him of harassing LaRouche and producing unduly negative coverage. At the end of the interview, Ezrol allegedly asked, \\"Have you ever feared for your personal safety?\\", which the editor found to be \\"chilling\\". Another LaRouche group, including Janice Hart, forced their way into the office of The Des Moines Registers editor in 1987, haranguing him over his paper's coverage of LaRouche and demanding that certain editorials be retracted. Dennis King began covering LaRouche in the 1970s, publishing a twelve-part series in a weekly Manhattan newspaper, Our Town, and later writing or cowriting articles about LaRouche in New Republic, High Times, Columbia Journalism Review, and other periodicals, culminating in a full-length biography published in 1989. King alleges numerous instances of anonymous harassment and threats. Leaflets appeared from the NCLC accusing King, a newspaper publisher, and Roy Cohn, the newspaper's lawyer, of being criminals, homosexuals, or drug pushers. One leaflet included King's home address and phone number. In 1984 a LaRouche newspaper, New Solidarity, published an article titled \\"Will Dennis King Come out of the Closet?\\", copies of which were distributed in his apartment building. Jeffrey Steinberg denied the movement had harassed King. LaRouche said that King had been \\"monitored\\" since 1979, \\"We have watched this little scoundrel because he is a major security threat to my life.\\" =Public altercations= LaRouche supporters in Chicago, 2007 From the 1970s to the 2000s, LaRouche followers have staffed tables in airports and other public areas. The tables have carried posters with topical slogans. LaRouche followers have been alleged to use a confrontational style of interaction. In 1986, the New York state elections board received dozens of complaints about people collecting signatures on nomination petitions, including allegations of misrepresentation and abusive language used towards those who would not sign. In the mid-80s, the Secretary of State of California, March Fong Eu, received complaints from the public about harassment by people gathering signatures to qualify the \\"LaRouche AIDS Initiative\\" for the state ballot. She warned initiative sponsors that permission to circulate the petitions could be revoked unless the \\"offensive activities\\" stopped. An altercation in 1987 between a LaRouche activist and an AIDS worker resulted in battery charges filed against the latter, who was outraged by the content of some of the material on display; she was found not guilty. In California in 2009, several grocery chains sought restraining orders, damages and injunctions against LaRouche PAC activists displaying materials related to Obama's health care plan in front of their stores, citing customer complaints.Banicki, Elizabeth (September 4, 2009). \\"Trader Joe's Wants LaRouche PAC Barred\\", Courthouse News ServiceBanicki, Elizabeth (September 4, 2009). \\"LaRouche PAC Is a Nuisance, Store Says\\", Courthouse News Service In Edmonds, Washington, a 70-year-old man from Armenia, grew irate at what he viewed as comparisons of Obama to Hitler. He grabbed fliers and tussled with LaRouche supporters, resulting in assault charges against him. =Canada= The North American Labour Party (NALP) nominated candidates in federal elections in the 1970s. Its candidates only had 297 votes nationwide in 1979. LaRouche himself offered a draft constitution for the commonwealth of Canada in 1981. The NALP later became the Party for the Commonwealth of Canada and that ran candidates in the 1984, 1988 and 1993 elections. Those were more successful, gaining as many as 7,502 votes in 1993, but no seats. The Parti pour la république du Canada (Québec) nominated candidates for provincial elections in the 1980s under various party titles. The LaRouche affiliate now operates as the Committee for the Republic of Canada.Comité pour la République du Canada =Latin America= Brazil's Party for Rebuilding of National Order (Prona) was described as a \\"LaRouche friend\\" and one of its members has been quoted in the Executive Intelligence Review as saying \\"We associate ourselves with the wave of ideas which flow from Mr. LaRouche's prodigious mind\\". PRONA gained six seats in the Chamber of Deputies in 2002. After gaining two seat in the 2006 election, the party merged with the larger Liberal Party forming the Republic Party. However, there is no independent evidence that the Prona or its leaders recognized LaRouche as an influence on their policies, and it has been described as being part of the right-wing Catholic integralist political tradition. The Ibero- American Solidarity Movement (MSIA) has been described as an offshoot of LaRouche's Labor Party in Mexico. During peace talks to resolve the Chiapas conflict, the Mexican Labor Party and the Ibero-American Solidarity Movement (MSIA) attacked the peace process and one of the leading negotiators, Bishop Samuel Ruiz García, whom it accused of fomenting the violence and of being controlled by foreigners. Posters caricaturing Ruiz as a rattlesnake appeared across the country... The movement strongly opposes perceived manifestations of neo-colonialism, including the International Monetary Fund, the Falklands/Malvinas War, etc., and are advocates of the Monroe Doctrine. =Australia= CEC members campaigning for Aaron Isherwood (center) LaRouche supporters gained control of the formerly far-right Citizens Electoral Council (CEC) in the mid-1990s. The CEC publishes an irregular newspaper, The New Citizen. Craig Isherwood and his spouse Noelene Isherwood are the leaders of the party. The CEC has opposed politician Michael Danby and the 2004 Australian anti-terrorism legislation. For the 2004 federal election, it nominated people for ninety-five seats, collected millions of dollars in contributions, and earned 34,177 votes. The CEC is concerned with Hamiltonian economics and development ideas for Australia. It has been critical of Queen Elizabeth II's ownership of an Australian zinc mine and believes that she exerts control over Australian politics through the use of prerogative power. It has been in an antagonistic relationship with the B'nai B'rith's Anti- Defamation Commission, which has been critical of the CEC for perceived anti- semitism. It has asserted that the Liberal Party is a descendant of the New Guard and other purported fascists such as Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes and Sir Robert Menzies. The CEC also says it is fighting for \\"real\\" Labor policies (from the 1930–40s republican leanings of the Australian Labor Party). =Europe= The LaRouche Movement has a major center in Germany. The (BüSo) (Civil Rights Movement Solidarity) political party is headed by Helga Zepp- LaRouche, LaRouche's wife. It has nominated candidates for elective office and publishes the ' newspaper. Zepp-LaRouche is also the head of the German-based Schiller Institute. In 1986 Zepp-LaRouche formed the \\"Patriots for Germany\\" party, and says it ran a full slate of 100 candidates. The party received 0.2 percent of the 4 million votes. In Germany, the leader of the Green Party, Petra Kelly, reported receiving harassing phone calls that she attributed to BüSo supporters. Her speeches were picketed and disrupted by LaRouche followers for years. Jeremiah Duggan, a student from the UK attending a conference organized by the Schiller Institute and LaRouche Youth Movement in 2003, died in Wiesbaden, Germany, after he ran down a busy road and was hit by several cars. The German police said it appeared to be suicide. A British court ruled that Duggan had died while \\"in a state of terror.\\"\\"No Joke\\", By April Witt, The Washington Post Sunday, October 24, 2004; Page W12 Duggan's mother believes he died in connection with an attempt to recruit him.

Its newspaper is Nouvelle Solidarité. The French LaRouche Youth Movement is headed by Élodie Viennot. Viennot supported the candidacy of Daniel Buchmann for the position of mayor of Berlin. LaRouche supporters in Stockholm protesting against the Treaty of Lisbon Sweden has an office of the Schiller Institute: Schillerinstitutet/EAP in Sweden, and the political party European Worker's Party (EAP). The former leader of the EAP, Ulf Sandmark, started as a member of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League (SSU), and was assigned to investigate the EAP and the ELC. After joining the EAP, he had his membership in SSU revoked. Following the Olof Palme assassination on February 28, 1986, the Swedish branch of the EAP came under scrutiny as literature published by the party was found in the apartment of the initial suspect, Victor Gunnarsson. Soon after the assassination, NBC television in the U.S. speculated that LaRouche was somehow responsible. Later, the suspect was released. No connection with LaRouche was shown. In Denmark, four candidates for parliament on the LaRouche platform (Tom Gillesberg, Feride Istogu Gillesberg and Hans Schultz) won 197 votes in the 2007 election (at least 32,000 votes are needed for a local mandate). The Danish LaRouche Movement (Schiller Instituttet)'s first newspaper distributed 50,000 copies around Copenhagen and Aarhus.Schiller Instituttet Kampagnaviser Schiller Instituttes Venner webpage The (MSA) is an Italian political party headed by Paolo Raimondi that supports the LaRouche platform. Ortrun Cramer of the Schiller Institute became a delegate of the Austrian International Progress Organization in the 1990s, but there is no sign of ongoing relationship. Polish newspapers have reported that Andrzej Lepper, leader of the populist Samoobrona party, was trained at the Schiller Institute and has received funding from LaRouche, though both Lepper and LaRouche deny the connection. Nataliya Vitrenko, leader of the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, has stated multiple times that she supports LaRouche's ideals In February 2008, the LaRouche movement in Europe began a campaign to prevent the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, according to the U.S.-based LaRouche Political Action Committee, \\"empowers a supranational financial elite to take over the right of taxation and war making, and even restore the death penalty, abolished in most nations of Western Europe.\\" LaRouche press releases suggest that the treaty has an underlying fascist agenda, based on the \\"Europe a Nation\\" ideas of Sir Oswald Mosley. =Asia, Middle East and Africa= The Philippines LaRouche Society calls for fixed exchange rates, US/Philippine withdrawal from Iraq, denunciation of former US Vice President Dick Cheney, and withdrawal of U.S. military advisors from Mindanao. In 2008 it also issued calls for the freezing of foreign debt payments, the operation of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, and the immediate implementation of a national food production program. It has an office in Manila, operates a radio show and says on its website, \\"Lyndon LaRouche is our civilization's last chance at world peace and development. May God help us.\\" On the matter of internal politics, LaRouche operative Mike Billington wrote in 2004, \\"The Philippines Catholic Church, too, is divided at the top over the crisis. The Church under Jaime Cardinal Sin, who is now retired, had given its full support to the 'people's power' charade for the overthrow of Marcos and Estrada, but other voices are heard today.\\" Later that year, he wrote: > The U.S.-orchestrated coup which overthrew the government of Philippines' > President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 was a classic case study of what John > Perkins describes in his recent book, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, as > the post-World War II preferred method of imposing colonial control under > another name. In the Philippines case, George Shultz performed the roles of > both the economic hit man, destroying and taking full control of the > Philippine economy, and the coup-master, deposing the Philippine President > in favor of an IMF puppet—while calling the operation 'people power.' According to Billington, representatives of LaRouche's Executive Intelligence Review and Schiller Institute had met with Marcos in 1985, at which time LaRouche was warning that Marcos would be the target of a coup, inspired by George Shultz and neoconservatives in the Reagan administration, because of Marcos' opposition to the policies of the International Monetary Fund. In 1986, LaRouche asserted that Marcos was ousted because he hadn't listened to LaRouche's advice: \\"he was opposed to me and he fell as a result.\\" The LaRouche movement is reported to have had close ties to the Ba'ath Party of Iraq. In 1997, the LaRouche movement, and the Schiller Institute in particular, were reported to have campaigned aggressively in support of the National Islamic Front government in Sudan. They organized trips to Sudan for state legislators, which according to The Christian Science Monitor was part of a campaign directed at African Americans. The Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee (LaRouchePAC) has been vocal in its support for the construction of the Thai Canal across the Kra Isthmus of Thailand. Periodicals and news agencies The LaRouche organization has an extensive network of print and online publications for research and advocacy purposes. =Executive Intelligence Review= The LaRouche movement maintains its own press service, Executive Intelligence Review. According to its masthead, EIR maintains international bureaus in Bogotá, Berlin, Copenhagen, Lima, Melbourne, Mexico City, New Delhi, Paris, and Wiesbaden, in addition to various cities in the U.S. =Broadcast= In 1986, the LaRouche movement bought WTRI, a low-powered AM radio station that covered western Maryland, northern Virginia, and parts of West Virginia. It was sold in 1991. In 1991, the LaRouche movement began producing The LaRouche Connection, a Public-access television cable TV program. Within ten months it was being carried in six states. Dana Scanlon, the producer, said that \\"We've done shows on the JFK assassination, the 'October Surprise' and shows on economic and cultural affairs\\". =Internet= In January 2001, LaRouche began holding regular webcasts every 1–2 months. These were public meetings, broadcast in video, where LaRouche gave a speech, followed by 1–2 hours of Q and A over the internet.

A New York State Supreme Court judge ruled that it was \\"fair comment\\" to describe them as anti- Semites.ADL FACTS, \\"The LaRouche Network: A Political Cult\\", Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith Civil Rights Division, Spring 1982, Vol. 27, No. 2, p. 9.U.S. Labor Party et al. v. Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, No. 79-11470 (N.Y. App. Div., 1980) United States v. Kokinda was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1990. The case concerned the First Amendment rights of LaRouche movement members on Post Office property. The Deputy Solicitor General arguing the government's case was future Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts. The Court confirmed the convictions of Marsha Kokinda and Kevin Pearl, volunteers for the National Democratic Policy Committee, finding that the Postal Service's regulation of solicitors was reasonable. Characterizations According to a biography produced by the LaRouche- affiliated Schiller Institute, the movement is based on a commitment to \\"a just new world economic order\\", specifically \\"the urgency of affording what have been sometimes termed 'Third World nations,' their full rights to perfect national sovereignty, and to access to the improvement of their educational systems and economies through employment of the most advanced science and technology.\\" The LaRouche movement has attracted devoted followers and developed some specific and elaborate policy initiatives, but has also been referred to variously as Marxist, fascist, anti-Semitic, a political cult, a personality cult, and a criminal enterprise. In 1984, LaRouche's research staff was described by Norman Bailey, a former senior staffer of the United States National Security Council, as \\"one of the best private intelligence services in the world\\".\\"Some Officials Find Intelligence Network 'Useful'\\", The Washington Post, January 15, 1985 The Heritage Foundation calls it \\"one of the strangest political groups in American history\\", and The Washington Monthly calls it a \\"vast and bizarre vanity press\\". The LaRouche movement is seen by some as a fringe political cult. Journalist and John Birch Society activist John Rees wrote in his Information Digest that the movement has \\"taken on the characteristics more of a political cult than a political party\\", and that LaRouche is given \\"blind obedience\\" by his followers. He has also called the movement a \\"cult of personality\\". In rebuttal, LaRouche called the accusations of being a cult figure \\"garbage\\", and denied having control over any of the groups affiliated with him. According to longtime critics Chip Berlet and Matthew N. Lyons: In the summer of 2009, LaRouche followers came under criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for comparing President Barack Obama to Hitler. Media figures as politically diverse as Rush Limbaugh and Jon Stewart criticized the comparison.\\"Press Hysteria Over LaRouche\\" 2009 LaRouche Political Action Committee OrganizationsCurrent organizations= Offices of Executive Intelligence Review, LaRouche PAC, 21st Century Science & Technology and New Federalist *Executive Intelligence Review Press Service (U.S.), a hub of the LaRouche movement *National Caucus of Labor Committees (U.S.) *Worldwide LaRouche Youth Movement (international) *LaRouche Political Action Committee (U.S.) *Schiller Institute (international, based in Germany and U.S.) *Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität (Germany) *International Caucus of Labor Committees (international, especially Canada, Australia, and others) *Citizens Electoral Council (Australia) *Philippine LaRouche Society *European Workers Party (Sweden) *Comités Laborales de Nuevo León (Mexico) *Solidarité et progrès (France) =United States businesses= *PMR Printing, Virginia *World Composition Services, Inc.

In his 1979 autobiography he contrasted the \\"golden souls\\" to \\"the poor donkeys, the poor sheep, whose consciousness is dominated by the infantile world-outlook of individual sensuous life\\". According to Dennis King, LaRouche believed that cadres \\"must be intellectually of a superior breed—a philosophical elite as well as a political vanguard\\". In 1986, LaRouche said during an interview, \\"What I represent is a growing movement. The movement is becoming stronger all the time...\\" During the criminal trials of the late 1980s, LaRouche called upon his followers to be martyrs, saying that their \\"honorable deeds shall be legendary in the tales told to future generations\\". Senior members refused plea agreements that involved guilty pleas as those would have been black marks on the movement. Former members report that life within the LaRouche movement is highly regulated. A former member of the security staff wrote in 1979 that members could be expelled for masturbating or using marijuana. Members who failed to achieve their fundraising quotas or otherwise showed signs as disloyal behavior were subjected to \\"ego stripping\\" sessions. Members, even spouses, were encouraged to inform on each other, according to an ex-member. Although LaRouche was officially opposed to abortion, a former member testified that women were encouraged to have abortions because \\"you can't have children during a revolution.\\" Another source said some group leaders coerced members into having abortions. John Judis, writing in The New Republic, stated that LaRouche followers worked 16-hour days for little wages. Former members have reported receiving harassing calls or indirect death threats. They say they have been called traitors. New Solidarity ran obituaries for three living former members. Internal memos have reportedly contained a variety of dismissive terms for ex-followers. One former member said that becoming a follower of LaRouche is \\"like entering the Bizarro World of the Superman comic books\\" which makes sense so long as one remains inside the movement. E. Newbold Smith, who married a du Pont, was indicted along with four associates for planning to have his son, Lewis du Pont Smith, and daughter-in-law abducted and \\"deprogrammed\\" after they joined the LaRouche movement and donated $212,000 of Lewis's approximately $10 million inheritance to a LaRouche publishing arm. The incident resulted in serious legal repercussions but no criminal convictions for those indicted, including private investigator Galen Kelly. E. Newbold Smith also successfully had his son declared \\"incompetent\\" to manage his financial affairs in order to block him from possibly turning over his inheritance to the LaRouche organization. Kenneth Kronberg, who had been a leading member of the movement, committed suicide in 2007, reportedly because of financial issues concerning the movement. His widow, Marielle (Molly) Kronberg, had also been a longtime member. She gave an interview to Chip Berlet in 2007 in which she made critical comments about the LaRouche movement. She was quoted as saying, \\"I'm worried that the organization may be in danger of becoming a killing machine.\\" In 2004 and 2005, Kronberg made contributions of $1,501 to the Republican National Committee and the election campaign of George W. Bush, despite the LaRouche movement's opposition to the Bush administration. According to journalist Avi Klein, LaRouche felt that this \\"foreshadowed her treachery to the movement.\\" Kronberg had been a member of the movement's governing National Committee since 1982 and was convicted of fraud during the LaRouche criminal trials. =Associates and managers= *Helga Zepp-LaRouche, wife, head of Schiller Institute and Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität *Amelia Boynton Robinson, SI vice chairwoman *Michael Billington, fundraiser (convicted of mail fraud) *William Wertz, chief fundraiser (convicted of mail fraud) *Edward W.

The Welsh in the early history of Chicago Thomas Jefferson Vance Owen, whose grandparents were from Wales, is considered \\"The True Founder of Chicago\\". He became the first president of the town of Chicago in 1833, and is responsible for sub-dividing the city into sections and towns. In fact, in early Chicago history, some of the city's mayors were of close Welsh heritage, including: *Buckner Stith Morris 1838–39 *Alexander Loyd 1840–41 *John P.

A former farm converted into a landscaped park and open-space area. This park is set on 114 hectares () of converted farm land, on the North Downs, near Walderslade. It is within the Kent Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. History The park is set within Capstone valley, between Hempstead and Walderslade. The valley has been used by human use since the Neolithic period, according to the various archaeological finds in the area. There were originally four large farms in the Walderslade and surrounding areas, including Walderslade Farm, Settingdon Farm, Shawstead Farm and Gibraltar Farm (the last two farms still exist). Shawstead Farm (and probably others nearby) were associated with the clearance of local woodland, in 1765 to help supply Chatham Dockyard with oak for the building of wooden sailing ships, launched at Chatham. Most of the larger and more valuable oak trees would have existed in the richer soil of the valley bottoms (Walderslade, Shawstead etc.) where the farms were typically located. Ruins of Upper Shawstead Farm Much of the current park boundaries used to belong to the farm of Shawstead Manor. The ruins of Upper Shawstead Farm are still within the boundary of the park. In 1376, Robert Belknapp was forced to give the manor to the Prior and Convent of Rochester to King Edward III, in atonement for certain misdemeanours. The land then remained in the ownership of the church, latterly the Church Commissioners in Canterbury, until 1928. During this time the land was rented out to local farmers, including the Crittendens, but the woodlands were managed by the Church Commissioners. In the 16th century, a Beacon was erected on the site for military warning and use for cavalry manoeuvres. In 1928, Chatham Council bought the land but it continued to be leased to a local farmer until 1984 when it was opened as a Country Park for Medway Council. Part of the site continues to be farmed by the Wills family (local farmers) who took on the agricultural tenancy in 1951. In 1985, the council stopped using the Shawstead landfill site (which has been in use since 1937), this has made more land for the country park, to the west of the park, mainly newly planted woodlands. In 1984, a section of land (covering an area of 7.8 hectares () ) was sold to create the riding school. Matthews Riding School occupies severals paddocks and equine livery buildings. The Visitor Centre Facilities It is owned and maintained by Medway Council. Visitors to the park, near Gillingham, can experience ancient woodlands, including: *Drow Hill Wood – which is the largest woodland block at 1.4 hectares () of mainly sweet chestnut coppice; * Maze Wood (also known as Capstone Wood) covers 1.9 hectares() of sweet chestnut coppice; * Round Glade Wood – which covers an area of 1.2 hectares () of chestnuts and oak; * Orchid Wood – an area of 1.5 hectares ()of ancient oak and ash (Fraxinus) woodland; * Millenium Wood – which covers an area of 0.6 hectares(). This woodland block was planted in two phases in 1997 and 2000 and contains mixed native species including ash (Fraxinus) silver birch, blackthorn, spindle and beech; * Tangle Wood 0.5 hectares() of hazel woodland; * Boundary Wood a narrow woodland belt of 0.5 hectares() dominated by ash (Fraxinus) coppices on the park's southern boundary. The woodlands are managed in the traditional way, by coppicing by the park rangers. The park also has large green meadows (including the Events Field) and the freshwater lake. At Capstone, a number of rarely sighted species of wildlife can be seen around the site, including great spotted woodpeckers, blackcaps, and willow warblers, within the woods. Yellowhammers in the hedges and in the meadows, skylarks. Many butterfly species can also be found in the park, including speckled wood, gatekeeper and brimstone, seen around the orchard and meadows. Over the lake, many species of dragonflies and damselflies can be seen. The Orchard Other facilities at Capstone include a children's play area, public and disabled toilets, refreshments (from a cafe overlooking the lake), picnic area, cycling paths, a visitor centre, fishing (a day ticket is required), an education room, a horse riding trail and a reptile garden (mainly a rock and scrub area). The Events Field is used for various outdoor acitivies including kite flying \\"Kites over Capstone\\", Cancer Research Race for Life The park has a very active volunteer group, who coppice within the woods, maintain the trails and complete many other essential works along with the park rangers. The park also is accredited with a Green Flag Award by Natural England.

He was recently a Director for Multilateral Organizations (2015–16) and before he was World Bank Country Director for the Russian Federation and a Resident Representative in Moscow (2012–15). He is a former Director for human development (education, health and social protection) in the South Asia region of the World Bank. He is the highest- ranked Polish official at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC, and also a former Director of the Office for Social Security Reform in the Government of Poland (1996–97), as well as a co-author of the design of the new Polish pension system. A graduate of the Warsaw School of Economics (MSc 1982, PhD 1987), with post-graduate studies at the London School of Economics (1989–90) and Harvard Business School (1999). Before joining the World Bank in 1990 Rutkowski was an assistant professor at the Warsaw School of Economics and did research work in the area of labor economics, macroeconomics, education, business development and productivity in the Centre for Labour Economics and the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. As a member of the secretariat of the Consultative Economic Council to the Polish government he also advised on early issues of economic and social transition to a market economy in Poland. He was also involved in interdisciplinary development endeavors as a member of the Polish Association for the Club of Rome and the British Association for the Club of Rome. In the World Bank in the period 1990–96, he initially worked on public finance issues in Tanzania and economic and social consequences of mass migration in China. From 1992 onwards he focused, however, on economic and social transition to a market economy in Central and Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union, with a particular emphasis on labor market adjustments and social security system reforms. Before joining the Polish government on leave from the World Bank in 1996, he was closely associated with early work on pension reforms in the Baltic States, Ukraine and Bulgaria, as well as with the reforms of the fiscal federalism in the Russian Federation (see \\"Federal Transfers in Russia and their Impact on Regional Revenues and Incomes\\", with Ph. Le Houerou, Comparative Economic Studies, 1996 (vol. XXXVIII), No. 2/3 (Summer/Fall), pp. 21–44). In the period 1996–97, Rutkowski led the team of Polish reformers (i.a. Marek Góra, Wojciech Misiąg, Aleksandra Wiktorow, Andrzej Bratkowski, Krzysztof Pater, Agnieszka Chłoń-Domińczak, Ryszard Petru) that prepared a path-breaking pension reform package in Poland. The reform entailed a move away from a traditional pay-as-you-go defined-benefit pension system towards a modern and self-sustainable system based on principles of defined contributions and partial pre-funding. With strong support of the Plenipotentiaries for Pension Reform (Andrzej Bączkowski and Jerzy Hausner) and ministers of finance (Grzegorz Kołodko and Marek Belka) the first laws of the reform package were passed in 1997, and the second batch in 1998 (with Ewa Lewicka as the Plenipotentiary, Leszek Balcerowicz as the minister of finance, and Marek Góra as Rutkowski's successor as director of the Office for Social Security Reform) to clear the way for the new pension reform to start on January 1, 1999.See Mitchell A. Orenstein, \\"Privatizing Pensions: The Transnational Campaign for Social Security Reform\\", Princeton University Press 2008 From 1998 to 2004, back in the World Bank, as sector manager for social protection, Rutkowski led a team of professionals working on pensions, labor markets and social assistance reforms in 28 countries of Central and Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union, as well as in Turkey. During this period a wave of social security reforms swept Central and Eastern Europe, including reforms in Latvia, Estonia, Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Croatia, Rumunia and Turkey. In the period 2004–08 Rutkowski was director for human development in the Middle East and North Africa region of the World Bank with his team focusing closely on education reforms, strengthening health systems and expanding and modernizing social security coverage in a volatile region. Rutkowski has edited and authored books and articles on subjects of social security and labor markets, including a first comprehensive review of labor markets in transition economies \\"Labor Markets: Wages and Employment\\" (with R. Jackman) [in:] \\"Labor Market and Social Policy in Central and Eastern Europe\\", Oxford University Press 1994, as well as e.g. World Development Report 1995 on labor markets (member of the core writing team), \\"Pension Reform in Europe: Progress and Process\\" (with R. Holzmann and M. Orenstein), World Bank 2003, and \\"Pensions\\" (with N. Barr) [in:] \\"Labor Market and Social Policy in Central and Eastern Europe\\", World Bank 2005. His current public policy reform interests include social security coverage, political economy of social reforms and managing public policy change. Rutkowski is a son of Jerzy Rutkowski (1914–89), an officer of Polish Home Army and a manager of the largest covert printing house (TWZW) during Nazi occupation and Warsaw Uprising, 1940–44.

Tragically, Daniel died in February 2008 from sudden infant death syndrome.

Hilary tried to work out their problems but Laurel asked her to leave. Hilary and Doug went home but visited again several weeks later. Laurel and Hilary reconciled and Hilary and Doug moved in with Laurel and her husband Ashley (John Middleton). The family began to move on from the tragedy of Daniel's death, but Daniel's postmortem revealed that he had been a carrier for cystic fibrosis. Ashley, Laurel and her parents were puzzled as neither family knew of any relative with that condition. Hilary became concerned when she learned Melanie Doland (Caroline Strong), whose son, Arthur (Alfie Clarke), who was born the same day as Daniel, said her sister had died of cystic fibrosis. A few weeks later, Greg Doland (Shaun Prendergast) told Hilary that Arthur was allergic to seafood. This was common in Hilary's family. Hilary became convinced that Daniel was not Laurel and Ashley's son, and despite Douglas, Ashley and Laurel thinking what Hilary was saying was due to her grief, she convinced the doctor to check the blood types again.

History The line was opened by the East and West Junction Railway between and in 1873. It was not very successful and in 1877 the two trains a day in each direction were discontinued. However, in 1899 the London extension of the Great Central Railway was opened through which brought extra traffic. Great Central services reached Byfield via Woodford South Curve which was built at the same time. Bradshaw's timetable for August 1899 shows the 5.20pm from terminating at Byfield, where it arrived at 7.36pm, 11 minutes after calling at . The curve was officially closed on 22 October 1900, but the rails remained in-situ for many years afterwards although the points were disconnected. The line was also helped by a partial reorganisation in 1908 and its merger into the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway The group of lines carried on unsteadily until grouping in 1923 when they became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway By 1905 there were four trains off the Great Central line and two Woodford to Stratford services. However demand reduced until in 1946 there was one morning through train each way, and one each way between Towcester and Byfield. The station closed on 5 April 1952, with freight finishing on 1 March 1965, The design of the station buildings was virtually the same as all the others on the line, with two platforms serving a passing loop in the otherwise single line. There was a single line siding with a goods shed and a timber signal box. To avoid having a crossing, the station was built close to an overbridge carrying the A361 road.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations. Vol. 1 Oxford Publishing The signal box's main function was to operate the ETS token system, although there was a facility to switch Byfield box out and operate a long block. Today, virtually all trace of the line and the station has disappeared Remains A single platform which is partly buried, and the foundations for the old goods shed which are in a severe state of decay, are all that remains of the railway station.byfield railway station platforms Routes A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Byfield See also * Beeching Axe  References External links * Byfield station on navigable 1946 O.

This film was inspired by the story Panch Parmeshwar, written by the famous writer Premchand. The film was produced by Tarachand Barjatya. The film stars Arun Govil, Om Shivpuri and Urmila Bhatt, and also marked the debut of actress Madhu Kapoor. Plot Manoharlal Agarwal (played by Om Shivpuri) and Satyaprakash Agarwal (played by Arvind Deshpande) are wealthy businessmen and close friends. Manoharlal enters into a dispute with Hariram and to solve this he asks his friend Satyaprakash to be the sole arbitrator. To bond their friendship more, Manoharlal proposes to wed his daughter Nirmala (played by Madhu Kapoor) with Satyaprakash's son Ajay (played by Arun Govil). He also proposes this in order to get favour from Satyaprakash in his case. Given the acceptances from both the families, Nirmala and Ajay keep meeting each other and soon fall in love. They are also engaged. But as the events in the case turn out, Satyaprakash gives his decision in favour of Hariram. This agitates Manoharlal and in vengeance he decides to break off the wedding. With his power of money he also gets himself appointed as a sole arbitrator in one of the cases involving Satyaprakash. He then decides to rule against Satyaprakash and ruin him financially. Nirmala is also made to marry another man, Murli. But just before the wedding, she decides to elope with Ajay. Seeing that her daughter has departed, Nirmala's mother goes in shock and falls critically ill. Hence Ajay brings back Nirmala so that her mother can feel better. In the case, Manoharlal sees how Satyaprakash is really innocent. Hence, with all the truth in front of him, he is unable to give a false verdict just for the sake of his vengeance. He thus realises in what situation Satyaprakash had been when he ruled and realises how the truth needs no support and always wins.

Special appearances are by Nadira as Sudha's mother, Iftekhar as Prosecution lawyer, Achyut Potdar as Judge and Simi Garewal as Defence attorney. The music is composed by Manas Mukherjee and the songs have been written by Vitthalbhai Patel, Nida Fazli and late Dushyant Kumar Tyagi. The six songs in the film have been sung by Mohd Rafi, Manna Dey, Asha Bhosle, Usha Mangeshkar, Nitin Mukesh, Preeti Sagar, Sudhakar Athale and baby Sagarika Mukherjee (daughter of music director Manas Mukherjee). Plot The story begins with Dr Rakesh (Vijayendra Ghatge) joining the Maharaja Yeshwantrao Chikitsalaya. He goes to meet his ex-flame Sudha (Neeta Mehta) at her place where she stays with her husband Saroj Kumar (Naseeruddin Shah) and daughter Aastha (Manisha Munshi). Saroj and Rakesh become good friends but Rakesh is sad to meet his ex-flame Sudha as someone else's wife. He goes in flashback mode and recalls the days when they were romancing and planning to marry. When Rakesh asks Sudha's hand from her mother (Nadira), she mentions that she had been a prostitute all her life and would his parents accept Sudha, being the daughter of a prostitute as their bahu. If they accept Sudha then she has no problem. Rakesh assures her that there will be no hassles in that but later when Rakesh meets Sudha, he informs her that his parents refused to accept her as his bride but he is willing to marry her. She spurns his offer saying that without his parents blessings, they cannot marry each other. Rakesh visits Sudha and Saroj frequently and finds that Saroj, who is a chain-smoker and a writer by profession, has coughing bouts very often. He advises Saroj to get admitted for 3 days in his hospital so that he can carry out various tests to ascertain his ailment. Saroj gets admitted though not willingly and finds the hospital confinement, injections and medicines very disgusting. The test reports confirm that he has lung cancer and that too in an advanced stage. When Rakesh breaks this news to Sudha and Saroj, they are shattered. Rakesh assures them that he will do his best to treat Saroj. Sister Mazy (Farida Jalal) is very popular and active in the hospital but has to leave daily at 6 in the evening to meet her boy- friend. One day, she is admitted in the same hospital due to gangrene in her knee. Her leg has to be amputated. One of the patients, Nandlal (Om Puri) is a chain beedi-smoker and is always up to mischief along with fellow patients. He keeps moving around the hospital asking beedis and matches from others. He befriends Saroj and borrows magazines from him for reading. In between, a hooch tragedy occurs and several victims are brought for admission in the hospital. There is a sudden spurt of serious patients and their kith and kin. Several die during treatment and the atmosphere in the hospital is one of grief, trauma and doom. Among the victims is Saroj's close friend Aatish Indori (Bharat Kapoor). Saroj is aggrieved to see his friend die in his arms. As time passes, Saroj's condition worsens and he repeatedly asks Rakesh to poison him to death as he cannot suffer the pain. Rakesh is shocked and gives solace to Saroj to endure and live on. Sudha gives full mental support to Saroj so that he finds reason to live. She beseeches Rakesh to do his best as a doctor. However, Saroj keeps requesting Rakesh to kill him and relieve him from the pain. Rakesh imagines the pain Saroj is undergoing and ponders over mercy-killing. He discusses the matter with his colleagues, who feel shocked at Rakesh's thinking. Saroj asks Sudha to marry someone after his demise and asks her to come to him attired as a bride. She does so and they share very happy moments in each other's arms. Rakesh sees her outside in the corridor coming out of the hospital room in her bridal dress and feels drawn to her and beseeches her to marry him after Saroj's death as he still loves her. She admonishes him for such thinking and goes off in disgust. Next day, she finds Rakesh standing gloomily in the corridor outside Saroj's room. She gets panicky and rushes in to find Saroj's lifeless body in the bed. She suspects Rakesh for killing Saroj. Police come to arrest Rakesh as post-mortem report mentioned that death was due to excessive morphine. The morphine injection ampules issued to Rakesh also seemed to be missing and unaccounted. The scene moves to the court where the Prosecution lawyer (Iftekhar) and Defence attorney (Simi Garewal) examine and cross-examine various witnesses before the judge (Achyut Potdar). The accused Rakesh seems to be sure to get convicted. One day, Nandlal discovers a suicide not written by Saroj to his wife Sudha in the magazine he quietly borrowed from Saroj from under his pillow, when he was asleep. He quickly rushes to the court and hands it over to the Defence attorney. She produces the note before the judge who acquits Rakesh by dismissing the criminal case after going through the note. The film ends with Rakesh, Sudha and her daughter Aastha shown together.

The Rokushō-ji were \\"sacred vow temples\\" (gogan-ji) built by imperial command following a precedent established by Emperor Shirakawa's Hosshō-ji.

Clearly the temples were not built simply as acts of piety but as ways of protecting estate income and a certain style of life. Evidently the building of new temples could serve as a coercive device to extract support from other kuge families and to justify the use of public taxes for the benefit of members of the imperial-house, the religious intent giving support to the political interest.Hall, John et al.

Lindblom is operated by the Chicago Public School system. The school originally constructed in 1919 is named for Robert Lindblom, a nineteenth-century Swedish–born trader on the Chicago Board of Trade. Designated for students intended to enter vocations in industrial and skilled trades, in the later 20th century, it developed curricula to prepare students for college and was known as Lindblom College Prep High School. The Chicago City Council approved the designation of the Lindblom Building as a Chicago landmark by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks on June 9, 2010. History Originally named the Robert Lindblom Technical High School, the three-story building was designed by architect Arthur Hussander and completed in 1919. Lindblom was designed in a Beaux-Arts style and has a neo-classical façade with Roman columns. The building contains a 2,000-seat auditorium (with two balconies), two gymnasiums, a large study hall/ballroom on the third floor with a barrel-vaulted ceiling and large skylights, a swimming pool, and a greenhouse. It first served a population with a high number of European immigrants and emphasized the importance of education in assimilation and advancement. As the number of industrial jobs declined following World War II and the job market changed, the school curricula were changed to emphasize preparation for college, to enable students to obtain degrees needed for the changing market. The school was renamed as Lindblom College Prep High School and has served the increasingly diverse student population. Architect's rendering of Lindblom, c. 1919. In 2003, Lindblom underwent a two-year, $42 million renovation to upgrade systems and prepare the school as a site for concentration in math and science, as planned by the Chicago Public Schools. BauerLatoza Studio was hired to develop the entire project, which modernized the architecture, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. BauerLatoza Studio also designed new computer and science labs that were installed throughout the building., BauerLatoza Studio The grand reopening was held by the Lindblom Alumni Association and the Board of Education on October 14, 2005. The occasion featured alumna Cheryl Burton, a prominent TV journalist in Chicago, as the mistress of ceremonies. The school reopened in the fall of 2005 as Lindblom Math & Science Academy. It welcomed its first class of freshmen and the final class of Lindblom College Prep High School graduated in the spring of 2006. Because of the poor reputation of the surrounding neighborhood, initially Lindblom Math & Science only had 25 prospective freshmen enrolled as of March 30, 2005, prior to its opening. In December 2008, Lindblom received preliminary landmark status from the Commission on Chicago Landmarks.City of Chicago, \\"Lindblom High School proposed for landmark status\\", December 4, 2008 In June 2010, the Chicago City Council's Landmarks Committee approved the designation of the school as a city landmark, citing it as a \\"distinctive and exceptional example\\" of the Beaux Arts Style of architecture \\"with its monumental classical façade, light- colored masonry and symmetry.\\" CurriculumSchedule= Lindblom Math & Science Academy is on a block schedule. Students have four classes per day: Three that last 100 minutes; one that lasts 50, and one 50-minute lunch period. This allows students to focus on depth over breadth. 100-minute classes meet two days a week, and 50 minute classes meet four days a week. The school offers Advanced Placement (AP) courses, by which students can earn college credit after successful completion of the course and an AP exam at the end of the school year. Lindblom was the first high school in Chicago Public Schools to adopt a year round balanced schedule =Academics= Lindblom is one of the ten selective enrollment schools in the city of Chicago. The school as a selective enrollment school offers only Honors and Advanced Placement level courses. Lindblom added their academic center middle school in 2008. Being one of only several other high schools in the city that offer an academic center in the high school building. The academic center students are commonly called as Ackies. The first graduating Ackie class will be in 2014, having spent five or six years at Lindblom. =Baxter International= In October 2008, Lindblom became partners with Baxter International as part of its SCIENCE@WORK initiative.Baxter International, \\"Chicago Public Schools Receive Major Corporate Donation for Science Education\\", Available on-line at http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/press_room/press_releases/2008/10_23_08_science_at_work.html, cited September 15, 2009 Baxter donated money to the schools for science education. The objective of the Baxter Initiative is twofold. First, Baxter provides support for Lindblom's biotechnology courses. It also has contributed to the creation of the teacher professional development program, the Biotechnology Center of Excellence. Teachers from other Chicago high schools can attend professional development at Lindblom in order to create their own biotechnology programs. The initiative also provides support for Chicago's Renaissance 2010 program and the Illinois Institute of Technology's (IIT) Instructional Development System. Activities and athletics Lindblom competes in the Chicago Public League (CPL) and also is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). Lindblom offers a wide variety of sports and extra curricular activities for its students to participate in including football, basketball, baseball, softball, soccer, water polo, wrestling, volleyball, cross country/track, swimming, golf, and bowling.

Its release was delayed until after production of Thank You, Mr. Moto and Mr Moto's Gamble. The film is based on the character of Mr. Moto created by John P. Marquand, and an original story by Norman Foster and Willis Cooper. Plot Over the ruins of Angkor Wat in Cambodia flies the airplane of aviatrix Victoria Mason, supposedly circumnavigating the world. Her actual destination is the kingdom of Tong Moi in French Indochina. Already in Tong Moi, Mr. Moto is posing as an archeologist, and newsreel cameramen Marty Weston and Chick Davis are traveling up the river. Once she is overhead, Mason lights a flare and bails out of her smoking plane which crashes nearby. Rescued by Moto, Mason goes into the village with Bokor the head priest of Shiva. As Weston and Davis arrive at the crash site, Moto has discovered the flare that “caused” the accident. While trying to film Mason and Tong Moi's ruler, the Rajah Ali, Keema, the Rajah's favorite wife mysteriously dies. Bokor claims that the foreigners and their camera caused her death and they are taken away for a trial. Meanwhile, Moto finds the true cause of Keema's death, a poison dart. At the temple of Shiva, Weston and Davis are pronounced guilty and are about to be thrown into a pit when an elderly guru appears. The guru impresses Bokor with his ability to charm a snake and to not be burned by a flaming poker. Bokor releases the foreigners at the orders of the guru. The following day Moto offers to pay the cameramen for images of the interior of the temple. They agree, and return to the temple with Mason. The three are confronted by the elderly guru who tosses their camera down the well. Bokor, seeing this, asks the guru to kill the foreigner, Moto. The guru agrees and returns to the temple, there discovering a concealed ammunition cache. After disposing of a guard, the guru disappears into a secret passageway. There he reveals himself to be Mr. Moto, in disguise. Moto writes a note saying that he discovered the ammunition and that Bokor is the leader of the revolt. He sends the message off by carrier pigeon but the Rajah kills the bird and intercepts the message. Later at a feast held in honor of the visitors, Moto is served the cooked bird on his plate and the Rajah reveals that he got the message. In his cabin, Moto is marking the secret ammunition cache on a map of the temple when one of Bokor's men comes in to kill him. After killing the intruder, Moto disguises himself as the assassin and sneaks into the night. Bokor begins searching Moto's cabin but is interrupted by Mason, who finds the hidden map. Bokor and his men follow Mason to the temple and capture her. The guru appears and pretends to hypnotize the captive. Meanwhile, Weston followed Mason to the temple and tries unsuccessfully to rescue her. Bonfire signals are made and Capt. Zimmerman the gun-runner arrives with Davis, who is taken captive as well. Zimmerman has been selling weapons to Bokor so that Bokor can start a revolution and depose the Rajah Ali. Zimmerman is killed by Yao in “payment” for his services. When Mason reveals Moto's identity, a fight ensues. Yao is killed and Bokor escapes and rounds up Zimmerman's men. The four inside the temple hold off the men with the weapons that were just delivered. Mason reveals that she is a British Secret Service agent and Moto reveals that he is also a spy. Rajah Ali arrives with his army and rounds up Bokor and his men. The Rajah's plan is to use the weapons Bokor purchased to revolt against the French. As the Rajah prepares to have Moto and the two cameramen executed, Mason distracts him so Moto can threaten to blow up the ammunition cache. The Rajah falls into the cache and the four heroes escape down the secret passage as the temple explodes. All ends well with Mason and Weston beginning a romance and Davis planning on becoming Moto's assistant. Davis faints when Moto tells him that his next assignment is to capture a murderer living on a volcanic island as the guest of headhunters.

Background The Nazi regime in Norway implemented its part of the Holocaust through a series of steps, starting with registration, then confiscation, internment and concentration, and ultimately deportation of Jews, primarily to Auschwitz. Some Jews had fled Norway to Sweden earlier in the war, but most had stayed in their homes until October 26, 1942. At that point, most men were arrested and detained in prison camps, while women and children were ordered to report to the nearest police station on a daily basis. The escape operation Although the Norwegian resistance movement had maintained a network of escape routes to Sweden, they were unprepared to deal with the urgent plight of Jews who faced deportation. In addition, simultaneously with the arrest and deportation of Jews in 1942, the Gestapo launched an offensive to identify and apprehend members of the Norwegian resistance. This put pressure both on the viability and capacity of existing escape routes. Carl Fredriksens Transport (named after Norway's King Haakon VII whose real name was Christian Frederik Carl Georg Valdemar Axel) came into being when four Jewish Norwegians appeared on the doorstep of nursery owner Rolf A. Syversen, asking for help. Through one of the leaders of Milorg, Ole Berg, Syversen contacted Alf Tollef Pettersen, who had been fired from the Norwegian police force for refusing to pledge loyalty to the Quisling regime. Pettersen had been hired to manage transportation and was intimately familiar with the roads from Oslo to the border to Sweden through Østfold. What started with a few nighttime drives turned into a large-scale operation. The group accepted all refugees, but charged those who could afford it 180 kroner. In time, the Norwegian resistance group Sivorg put its clandestine network and financial resources behind it. Pettersen, his wife Gerd, Syversen, and the resistance leader Reidar Larsen managed the operation. Altogether about 1,000 refugees were moved to safety, of whom approximately 500 were Jewish. The name Carl Fredriksens Transport was based on the original name of the exiled Norwegian king Haakon VII, who was Carl, son of Fredrik, but also sounded like a common Norwegian name. After having found their way to Syversen's nursery near Carl Berners plass in Oslo,The nursery has since been demolished, but the location is at refugees were loaded on the backs of trucks, and covered by a tarp. Children were often sedated. Gerd Pettersen forged bills of lading and other necessary documents. Sivorg's network along the route would monitor German or border police patrols. The last leg of the route followed this road the last few hundred meters to the borderThe route varied somewhat, but would typically end up near Orderudseter, just a few hundred yards short of the Swedish border. The refugees would walk this last distance. The operation started in late November 1942. About ten truckloads a week went to the border and back in the dark of night, mostly with headlights off. By mid-January, the network had been infiltrated by Norwegian collaborators and had to be shut down. The Pettersens made a successful dash for the border in a sedan, breaking the axle just as they crossed into Sweden. Rolf Syversen stayed in Oslo, but was arrested for an unrelated matter in June. He was executed at Trandumskogen in November 1944. Commemoration Although this was the largest rescue operation in Norway during World War II, it was virtually unknown for decades. In order to maintain operational security, the refugees were not aware that they were part of a larger scheme, and their rescuers' identities were kept secret in any event. Ragnar Ulstein, a historian who specialized in the stream of refugees from Norway to Sweden, uncovered the most important features during an interview with Alf Tollef Pettersen. Oslo Jewish Museum has continued the research started by Ulstein and interviewed Gerd Pettersen before she died. In September 2010, a commemorative plaque and cast-iron truck were unveiled at the turn-off to the private road that went to the Swedish border. Filmmaker Robert Murphree is working to create a movie about the operation, historian Mats Tangestuen at Oslo Jewish Museum is writing a book, and artist Victor Lind is creating a public space at the site of Syversen's nursery he is calling \\"This is a Good Place\\" (Dette er et fint sted). A bicycle ride, named after the operation, takes place in mid-August from Fetsund, along the original route and to the border crossing to Sweden. The Pettersen's granddaughter Ane Munkeby arranges the ride.

The history of science and technology in Mexico spans many years. Ancient Mexican civilizations developed mathematics, astronomy, and calendrics, and solved technological problems of water management for agriculture and flood control in Central Mexico. Following the Spanish conquest in 1521, New Spain (colonial Mexico) was brought into the European sphere of science and technology. The Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, established in 1551, was a hub of intellectual and religious development in colonial Mexico for over a century. During the Spanish American Enlightenment in Mexico, the colony made considerable progress in science, but following the war of independence and political instability in the early nineteenth century, progress stalled. During late 19th century under the regime of Porfirio Díaz, the process of industrialization began in Mexico. Following the Mexican Revolution, a ten-year civil war, Mexico made significant progress in science and technology. During the 20th century, new universities, such as the National Polytecnical Institute, Monterrey Institute of Technology and research institutes, such as those at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, were established in Mexico. According to the World Bank, Mexico is Latin America's largest exporter of high-technology goods (High-technology exports are manufactured goods that involve high R&D; intensity, such as in aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, and electrical machinery) with $40.7 billion worth of high- technology goods exports in 2012. Mexican high-technology exports accounted for 17% of all manufactured goods in the country in 2012 according to the World Bank. Early history of science in Mexico The Caracol, Maya, Chichen Itza, Mexico, ca. 800-900 CE. El Caracol means \\"snail shell,\\" and this unusual round northern Maya structure encloses a circular staircase. The building may have been atemple to Kukulkan with an astronomical observatory at the summit. The Olmec, a Pre-Columbian civilization living in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, calendar system required an advanced understanding of mathematics. The Olmec number system was based on 20 instead of decimal and used three symbols- a dot for one, a bar for five, and a shell-like symbol for zero. The concept of zero is one of the Olmecs' greatest achievements. It permitted numbers to be written by position and allowed for complex calculations. Although the invention of zero is often attributed to the Mayans, it was originally conceived by the Olmecs. Mayans symbol for zero To predict planting and harvesting times, early peoples studied movements of the sun, stars, and planets. They used this information to make calendars. The Aztecs created two calendars one for farming and one for religion. The farming calendar let them know when to plant and to harvest crops. An Aztec calendar stone dug up in Mexico City in 1790 includes information about the months of the year and pictures the sun god at the center. Sun Stone, also called the Aztec Calendar Stone, on display at the National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City. After the Viceroyalty of New Spain was founded, the Spanish brought the scientific culture that dominated Spain to the Viceroyalty of New Spain.Fortes & Lomnitz (1990), p. 13 The Franciscan order founded the first school of higher learning in the Americas, the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco in 1536, at the site of an Aztec school.Where Is the Oldest University in the New World? Donald D. Brand. New Mexico Anthropologist Vol. 4, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1940), pp. 61-63 The municipal government (cabildo) of Mexico City formally requested the Spanish crown to establish a university in 1539.Levy (1986), p. 116 The Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico (Real y Pontificia Universidad de México) was established in 1551. The university was administered by the clergy and it was the official university of the empire. It provided quality education for the people, and it was a hub of intellectual and religious development in the region. It taught subjects such as physics and mathematics from the perspective of Aristotelian philosophy. Augustinian philosopher Alonso Gutiérrez in 1553 he became the first professor of the University of Mexico. He wrote Physica speculatio, the first scientific text in the Americas, in 1557. By the late 18th century, the university had trained 1,162 doctors, 29,882 bachelors, and many lawyers. Educated by the Jesuits in Mexico Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora displayed an astonishing proficiency in science and mathematics. During the late 17th century he won the chair of mathematics and astronomy at the University of Mexico. Sigüenza challenged the official doctrine that comets were divine portents of disaster and argued for their natural origin. He is considered the first scientist of colonial Mexico to question the scholasticism that permeated the university and most of society. Science during the Mexican Enlightenment Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora Andrés Manuel del Río was the first person to isolate vanadium. During the Mexican Enlightenment, science can be divided into the four periods: the early period (from 1735 to 1767), the Creole period (from 1768 to 1788), the official or Spanish period (from 1789 to 1803) and the period of synthesis (from 1804 to the beginning of the Mexican independence movement in 1810). During the 16th and 17th centuries, modern science developed in Europe but it lagged behind in Mexico. The new ideas developed in science in Europe were not important in Mexico.Fortes & Lomnitz (1990), pp. 13-4 The 1767 expulsion of Jesuits, who had introduced the new ideas in Mexico, helped to antagonize the Creoles and also promoted national feelings among Mexicans.Fortes & Lomnitz (1990), p. 15Fortes & Lomnitz (1990), p. 14 After the expulsion, self-taught Creoles were the first scientists in Mexico. Later on, they were joined by the Spanish scientists, and they did research, teaching, publishing, and translating texts. The ideas of Francis Bacon and René Descartes were freely discussed at seminars, which caused scholasticism to lose strength. During the Mexican Enlightenment, Mexico made progress in science. Progress were made in subjects such as astronomy, engineering, etc. In 1792 the Seminary of Mining was established. Later it became College of Mining, in which the first modern physics laboratory in Mexico was established. Famous scientists of the Enlightenment included José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez and Andrés Manuel del Río. Río discovered the chemical element vanadium in 1801. Science after the Mexican War of Independence Manuel Mondragón The Mexican War of Independence brought an end to Mexico's scientific progress. The Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico closed in 1833. For many years, there were no scientific activities in Mexico. The Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico was definitively shut down in 1865.Summerfield, Devine & Levi (1998), p. 285 During the end of the nineteenth century, the process of industrialization began in Mexico. Under the influence of positivists and scientific thinkers, the government assisted in public education. In 1867 Gabino Barreda, a student of Auguste Comte, was charged with the commission aimed at reforming education. Subjects such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics were included into the secondary school curriculum. National Preparatory School was established. The influence of positivists led to a renaissance of scientific activity in Mexico.Fortes & Lomnitz (1990), p. 16 General Manuel Mondragon invented the Mondragón rifle during this time. These designs include the straight-pull bolt-action M1893 and M1894 rifles, and Mexico's first self- loading rifle, the M1908 - the first of the designs to see combat use.

During the 20th century, Mexico made significant progress in science and technology. New universities and research institutes were established. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, UNAM) was officially established in 1910,Coerver, Pasztor & Buffington (2004), p. 161 and the university become one of the most important institutes of higher learning in Mexico. UNAM provides world class education in science, medicine, and engineering.Summerfield, Devine & Levi (1998), p. 286 Many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning, such as National Polytechnic Institute (founded in 1936),Forest & Altbach (2006), p. 882 were established during the first half of the 20th century. Most of the new research institutes were created within UNAM. Twelve institutes were integrated into UNAM from 1929 to 1973.Fortes & Lomnitz (1990), p. 18 Mexican scientists, physicians, and intellectuals were involved in the movement to shape Mexico's population through eugenics. The Sociedad Mexicana de Eugenesia was founded in 1931, and was concerned with mental retardation, prison reform, tuberculosis, syphilis, alcoholism, sexual education, mestizaje, prostitution, puericulture, (scientific child-rearing), and single mothers. The society advocated for maternal assistance, eradication of juvenile delinquency, and incorporation of its ideas into the functioning of schools, prisons, and public health administration.

Luis Barragán won the Pritzker Prize, the highest award in architecture, in 1980 In the 1930s Manuel Sandoval Vallartaa Mexican physicist worked on Cosmic ray research and by the 1943 to 1946, he divided his time between MIT and UNAM as a full-time professor. Antonio Lazcano served as president of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life. On August 31, 1946, Guillermo González Camarena sent his first color transmission from his lab in the offices of The Mexican League of Radio Experiments, at Lucerna St. #1, in Mexico City. The video signal was transmitted at a frequency of 115 MHz. and the audio in the 40 meter band. González Camarena was a Mexican engineer who was the inventor of a color-wheel type of color television, and who also introduced color television to Mexico. Mexico was in the forefront of the Green Revolution, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and developed by Norman Borlaug, who later won the Nobel Prize for his work. The aim was to increase the productivity of Mexican agriculture through the development of new strains of seeds. Mexico founded the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center to further this scientific work.Joseph Cotter, Troubled Harvest: Agronomy and Revolution in Mexico, 1880–2002, Westport, CT: Praeger.

In 1959, the Mexican Academy of Sciences (Academia Mexicana de Ciencias) was established as a non-governmental, non-profit organization of distinguished scientists. The Academy has grown in membership and influence, and it represents a strong voice of scientists from different fields, mainly in science policy. By 1960, science was institutionalized in Mexico. It was viewed as a legitimate endeavor by the Mexican society. In 1961, the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute was established as a center for graduate studies in subjects such as biology, mathematics, and physics. In 1961, the institute began its graduate programs in physics and mathematics and schools of science were established in Mexican states of Puebla, San Luis Potosí, Monterrey, Veracruz, and Michoacán. The Academy for Scientific Research was established in 1968 and the National Council of Science and Technology was established in 1971. In 1995 Mario J. Molina became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science. Ricardo Miledi, one of the ten most quoted neuro-biologists of all time, was born in Mexico, D.F. in 1927. His career in science began in 1955 when, just before graduating in Medicine at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico (UNAM), he joined one of the most active research groups in his country, part of the Instituto Nacional de Cardiología (the National Institute of Cardiology). Many of Professor Miledi's studies and breakthroughs in Neurobiology, especially those related to the mechanisms of synaptic and neuromuscular transmission, are considered to be classic throughout the world. Over 450 publications are the tangible product of forty years of research devoted in the main to the primary functions of the nervous system: the transmission of information between cells. He has been a member of the Royal Society of London since 1980, and entered the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986. In 1999 Miledi was awarded with the Prince of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research. He has been Professor of Biophysics at the University of London and distinguished professor of the University of California since 1984. He also leads a neurobiology laboratory in UNAM in Querétaro, México. In 1985 Rodolfo Neri Vela became the first Mexican citizen to enter space as part of the STS-61-B mission. Tessy María López Goerne nominated for the Nobel Prize in chemistry. In 1995 Mexican chemist Mario J. Molina shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen, and F. Sherwood Rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone. Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science. The Large Millimeter Telescope was inaugurated on 22 November 2006. It is the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range, built for observing radio waves in the wavelengths from approximately 0.85 to 4 mm. Located on top of the Sierra Negra. It is a binational Mexican (70%) - American (30%) joint project. In 1962, the National Commission of Outer Space (Comisión Nacional del Espacio Exterior, CONNE) was established, but was dismantled in 1977. On July 30, 2010 the law to create the Agencia Espacial Mexicana (AEM) was published. It is now in the process of defining the National Space Policy and its program of activities. Robotics is a new area under development in Mexico, the Mexone Robot is one of the most advanced robot designs in the world.

Desktop and tablet PC made in Guadalajara by local company Meebox Based on the information managed by Scopus, a bibliographic database for science, the Spanish web portal SCImago places Mexico at 28th in country scientific ranking with 82,792 publications, and 34th considering its value of 134 for the h-index. Both positions are computed for the period 1996–2007. The electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. In 2007 Mexico surpassed South Korea as the second largest manufacturer of televisions, and in 2008 Mexico surpassed China, South Korea and Taiwan to become the largest producer of smartphones in the world. There are almost half a million (451,000) students enrolled in electronics engineering programs. Chicxulub crater The Chicxulub crater is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. The Alvarez hypothesis posits that the mass extinction of the dinosaurs and many other living things during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event was caused by the impact of a large asteroid on the Earth. Evidence indicates that the asteroid fell in the Yucatán Peninsula, at Chicxulub, Mexico. The hypothesis is named after the father-and-son team of scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez, who first suggested it in 1980.

At 98 kilometres it is the longest branch line in Bavaria. Construction The line was built in two stages. After construction started in 1878 the 63 km long Neumarkt-Sankt Veit–Pocking section was opened on 1 September 1879 as a Sekundärbahn (secondary line). On 4 October 1883 it was given a junction at Landshut. Following the approval of its extension eastwards in 1884, the second, 35 km long, section from Pocking to Passau was completed in the years 1887 and 1888. From 6 October 1888 the route was fully operational from end to end. At 9.15 am on that day a trial train departed from Passau with seven coaches hauled by a D VII. At 2.30 pm it set off from Pocking on the return journey. The second section was built as a Lokalbahn; it was markedly slower and the trackbed was clearly of lighter and cheaper construction. On 15 October 1888 the Lokalbahn section was opened in both directions with two mixed trains. Once the route from Pocking to Kößlarn was opened on 1 December 1914 it offered a direct linkt to Simbach am Inn. Operation On 8 January 1916 at 19.30 passenger train no. 81 crashed down an embankment between Pfenningbach and Neustift due to a landslide. The engine driver died, the fireman was seriously injured, four officials and eight passengers were lightly injured. In the spring of 1933, the only 3 examples of the Class VT 133 railbus from Passau Hauptbahnhof were taken out of service. The 1934 timetable shows that, at that time, of the four passenger trains running daily, three of them were railbuses. The latter took 159 minutes to complete the journey, by contrast the steam train needed 240 minutes, of which 12 to and 15 minutes were required for water stops in Pocking and Pfarrkirchen. As early as 1977 there were moves to close the line. But tourist traffic to the Lower Bavarian \\"spa triangle\\" (Niederbayerisches Bäderdreieck increased its importance again despite the unfavourable routing of the line. There were even through coaches from northern and western Germany to Pocking. On 1 September 1979 the line's centenary was remembered in Pfarrkirchen with special celebrations, not least as a protest against possible plans for closure. Uerdingen railbuses were usually used for scheduled passenger services in the second half of the 20th century. Current operation Since the opening of the Mühldorf star network (Liniensterns Mühldorf) in 1994 the route has been worked almost every two hours (from 2001 by the SüdostBayernBahn) with Class 628 multiples on the Passau−Mühldorf route. Certain services offer a direct connexion to other termini on the network. Scheduled train crossings take place in Eggenfelden, Pfarrkirchen, Pocking, Sulzbach/Inn and Fürstenzell. In addition on Saturdays there are through services between Hamburg and Mühldorf, which are especially intended for spa guests staying in the spa triangle of the Rottal-Inn district. From the timetable change in December 2009 it is intended to run hourly fixed-interval services on this route. To achieve that the halt at Massing will be upgraded to a crossing station. These train services will initially continue to be provided by the SOB until December 2016.http://www.eurailpress.com/news/news.php3?id=19596 Bavaria: Additional public transport awarded to DB Regio. To realise this project 10 million euros have been spent on upgrading the railway since 2002. Stundentakt für the Rottalbahn As well as investment in the track, the halts have also had money spent on them. The halt at Eggenfelden Mitte was rebuilt nearer the centre of the town, those at Bad Höhenstadt, Neukirchen am Inn and Passau-Neustift were modernised. Fürstenzell station was also renovated for 115,000 euros. Moreover, Sulzbach am Inn, Ruhstorf an der Rott and Engertsham will also be refurbished, for which a further 100,000 euros has been set aside. Fares Between Passau and Karpfham the line is integrated into the Passau District Transport Union, between Bayerbach and Massing fares are set by the Rottal-Inn Transport Union. Special services Historic railbus sets of the DB Class 798/998 type belonging to the Passau Railway Society make regular appearances on the Rott Valley Railway. No. 798 706-8 was the last VT 798 that worked the route in 1994 as a scheduled passenger train. In addition steam locomotive nos. 638.1301 and 657.2770 with twin-axled Spantenwagen often grace the line.  Accidents Accidents and near-misses occur frequently at the 100 or so level crossings without barriers. The SüdostBayernBahn is therefore seeking to protect the unsupervised road crossings increasingly with flashing lights and barriers. On 14 August 2008 two motor scooter riders were struck by trains at different places on the line and killed.

Life After graduating from UCLA in 1976 with a B.A. in music composition and violin, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he quickly established his reputation as a talented young improvising violinist, appearing on many recordings and making guest appearances with the David Grisman Quartet and jazz violin legend Stephane Grappelli. In 1981 he undertook a master's degree program in music composition at Antioch University West, where his groundbreaking work integrating stylistic elements of jazz, European classical, American folk and Indian classical music led to the creation of the Turtle Island Quartet in the fall of 1985. His tenure with TIQ has included several recordings on labels such as Windham Hill, Chandos, Koch and Telarc, which released their most recent CD, 2008 Grammy winning “A Love Supreme: The Legacy Of John Coltrane.” Their previous Telarc release, “4+Four,” in collaboration with the Ying Quartet, also won a Grammy in the same category, Classical Crossover, in 2006. Balakrishnan has also himself received two GRAMMY nominations in the category of best instrumental arrangement, the first for his arrangement of Dizzy Gillespie's \\"A Night In Tunisia\\" from TIQ's first recording, and the second for his arrangement of “You’ve Changed,” from their 2002 release Danzón, featuring clarinetist Paquito D’Rivera. Other TIQ credits include soundtracks for major motion pictures, TV and radio credits such as the Today Show and All Things Considered, feature articles in People and Newsweek magazines, and collaborations with famed artists such as The Manhattan Transfer, pianists Billy Taylor and Kenny Barron, the Ying Quartet and the Parsons Dance Company. Balakrishnan has been awarded numerous composing grants, both from private sources such as conductor Marin Alsop, who commissioned his piece for violin and orchestra, “Little Mouse Jumps,” as well as national service organizations such as the National Endowment for the Arts and Meet The Composer foundations. In 2005 he received a MTC/ASOL “Music Alive” three year extended residency with the Nashville Chamber Orchestra, for which he is composing six orchestral works. The NCO also commissioned Balakrishnan’s composition “Darkness Dreaming,” which premiered in April 2004 with guitarists Sharon Isbin and John Jorgenson. His piece, “Spider Dreams” (1992), has been widely performed and recorded throughout the world by a diverse array of musical organizations, including a live recording by Turtle Island with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra conducted by Neeme Järvi on Chandos Records. A 2002 commission awarded by a consortium of presenters headed by the Lied Center of Kansas City resulted in a string octet entitled “Mara’s Garden Of False Delights,” which is featured on Turtle Island Quartet’s Grammy winning Telarc release, “4 plus Four.” His most recent commission is again from the Lied Center, who received a Creative Campus grant from the Duke foundation, for which Balakrishnan is composing a full-length work involving theatre, dance, video, and Turtle Island with the KU wind ensemble that is an artistic response to the social issues concerning the various theories of evolution, both scientific and cultural, entitled “The Tree Of Life.”http://www.baylinartists.com/userfiles/TI%20Individual%20bios%281%29.pdf Compositions and Performances Trishula, for violin and symphony orchestra :premiered June 2007 at Schermerhorn Symphony Hall in Nashville by violinist Gilles Apap and the Nashville Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Paul Gambill.

He began his career as an opera singer in Italy before moving to the United States to pursue an acting career in films. He appeared in several Hollywood movies during the 1930s and 1940s while simultaneously working as a leading tenor at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Martini possessed a warm lyric tenor voice that had a wide range and considerable amount of coloratura facility. He sang mostly within the Italian repertoire that encompassed the bel canto literature of Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini, the grand operas of Giuseppe Verdi, and the verismo operas of Giacomo Puccini. Biography Martini studied singing under Giovanni Zenatello and Maria Gay who were married and both well known opera singers. In 1925 he made his professional opera debut in Milan as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's Rigoletto. Shortly thereafter he toured Europe as a concert artist appearing in many of the continent's major music centers. While in Paris he was discovered by the film producer Jesse Louis Lasky who engaged him for several Italian language speaking roles in short films. In 1929, under the influence of Lasky, Martini immigrated to the United States to pursue a film career. His first appearance was in the Paramount Pictures all-star revue film Paramount on Parade (1930), in which he sang the song \\"Come Back to Sorrento\\" in one of the film's Technicolor sequences. This film has been restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Metropolitan Opera House At Lincoln Center 2 Further forays into film were postponed, however, as Martini decided to continue to pursue an opera career. He made his U.S. opera debut in 1931 in Philadelphia. This was followed by several broadcasts of opera for radio. In 1933 Martini joined the roster at the Metropolitan Opera, making his debut on December 28 as the Duke of Mantua. He appeared in several more productions at the Met over the next thirteen years, singing the roles of Alfredo in La Traviata, Carlo in Linda di Chamounix, Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, Ernesto in Don Pasquale, Rinuccio in Gianni Schicchi, Rodolfo in La Bohème, and Ruggero in La Rondine. His last performance at the Met was as Count Almaviva in Il Barbiere di Siviglia on April 20, 1946. While performing at the Met, Martini occasionally returned to Hollywood to appear in films, mostly appearing in pictures produced by Lasky. His film credits include Here's to Romance (1935), Music for Madame (1937), and The Gay Desperado (1936). The latter film featured Ida Lupino as his co-star, was directed by Rouben Mamoulian, produced by Jesse Lasky and Mary Pickford, and released by United Artists. His last film appearance was in One Night With You in 1948. In 1945 Martini portrayed Rodolfo to Grace Moore's Mimi for the inaugural performance of the San Antonio Grand Opera Festival. In the late 1940s and 1950s Martini continued to perform as a singer mostly on the radio. He eventually returned to Italy where he lived in Verona until his death in 1976. Recordings Martini made a few recordings of opera arias for Columbia Records who also produced the soundtracks to several of the films that he appeared in. He also recorded some music with RCA Victor and recorded the entire role of Ernesto in Don Paquale with the Metropolitan Opera in 1940 opposie Bidu Sayão in the title role.

It seeks to be the authoritative source for information on the built environment and to be the credible voice of the profession.http://www.aiacolumbus.org/index.php/home/about-us/our-mission AIA Columbus Mission Statement The Chapter is headquartered in the capital city of Columbus, currently in the Center for Architecture and Design at 50 West Town Street, Suite 110, in the historic Lazarus Building.  History  The Chapter was preceded by an organization called the Columbus Society of Architects, begun circa 1909, with Frank L. Packard, FAIA, as its president. The organization had 45 members, developed a sketch club among the city's draftsmen, and formed a committee for the purpose of establishing a connection with the Institute.The Western Architect, Volume 13; 1909; The Western Architect (Incorporated), Minneapolis, Minnesota; page 2 The location of the Chapter's Charter is currently unknown, therefore no verifiable evidence of the names of Charter Members exists. However, the 1914 Annuary, or directory of AIA Members, lists as a Fellow: Frank L. Packard, and as Members: C. W. Bellows, G. H. Bulford, A. A. Dole, F. W. Elliott, O. D. Howard, Carl Eugene Howell, Charles L. Inscho, C. E. Howell (duplicate), J. E. McCarty, Roy J. Merriam, C. E. Richards (né Clarence Earl Richards; 1864–1921), and J. W. Thomas, Jr. In addition to the Institute Members, there were 18 Non-Institute or Chapter Members. Early Chapter Members on the Annual Reports to the Institute included Ralph Snyder and Otto C. Darst. This category of membership was abolished by Institute Convention in 1916. The Chapter was originally organized as a For-Profit Corporation (prior to the establishment of Ohio's non-profit corporate laws) on May 7, 1913.http://www2.sos.state.oh.us/pls/bsqry/f?p=100:7:0::NO:7:P7_CHARTER_NUM:31399 The Chapter was chartered by the American Institute of Architects on May 21, 1913.Letter from Edward. C. Kemper, Institute Executive Secretary dated March 14, 1938, addressed to Kyle W. Armstrong, President of AIA Columbus On April 23, 1959, the chapter filed articles of incorporation as a Not For Profit Corporation with the Ohio secretary of state. = Foundation = In 1974, the Chapter established a 501(c)(3) organization to encourage knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the built environment of the Columbus, Ohio, metropolitan area; to produce a guide to its architectural heritage; to establish and maintain an archive for collecting and disseminating information relative to its development; and to receive and maintain funds relative to its exempt purposes. The original name was \\"Foundation of The Columbus Chapter of The American Institute of Architects\\" according to the original Articles of Incorporation accepted by the Secretary of State on December 4, 1974. The name was changed to \\"Columbus Architecture Foundation\\" on October 9, 1978. On August 1, 2011, the foundation begin operating under the name \\"Center for Architecture and Design\\". The first tangible project produced by the foundation was a coffee table book titled Architecture: Columbus, self- published in 1976.Architecture: Columbus; 1976; Robert E. Samuelson, Pasquale C. Grado, Judith L. Kitchen, and Jeffrey T. Darbee; The Foundation of The Columbus Chapter of The American Institute of Architects, Columbus, Ohio In 2008, a second publication titled The AIA Guide to Columbus was published by Ohio University Press.  Organization  The location of the Chapter has changed but a few times over the years. The address listed on the Chapter's original Articles of Incorporation is 50 West Broad Street, Suite 2440, Columbus 15, Ohio. The building at this address is a 44-story structure built 1924–27, and was originally known as the American Insurance Union Citadel. Designed by C. Howard Crane of Detroit in the Art Moderne style, it is currently known as the LeVeque-Lincoln Tower. At the time of its construction, it was the tallest building in the state, and was known as the \\"first aerial lighthouse\\" in the country, as it served as a guide to aviators.Architecture: Columbus; 1976; Robert E. Samuelson, Pasquale C. Grado, Judith L. Kitchen, Jeffrey T. Darbee; The Foundation of The Columbus Chapter of The American Institute of Architects, Columbus, Ohio; page 77 The original Statutory Agent for the Chapter was listed as Hugh Wait. In 1976, when the book Architecture: Columbus was published, the Chapter's offices were located at 1631 Northwest Professional Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43220.Architecture: Columbus; 1976; Robert E. Samuelson, Pasquale C. Grado, Judith L. Kitchen, Jeffrey T. Darbee; The Foundation of the Columbus Chapter of The American Institute of Architects; credits page (preceding page i) These quarters were a more modest suburban style office complex. The Statutory Agent and Executive Director of the Chapter was Inez L. Kirby, Honorary AIA. For a period of time, Ms. Kirby served concurrently as Executive Director of the Columbus Chapter and the Architect's Society of Ohio, currently known as AIA Ohio, A Society of the American Institute of Architects. In 1999, the Chapter relocated back into the downtown area, directly across West Broad Street from its original quarters. On the Subsequent Appointment of Agent form naming Amy M. Kobe, Honorary AIA,[Executive Director 1997–2004] as the Chapter's Statutory Agent, accepted by the Secretary of State on September 23, 1999, the address is listed as 21 West Broad Street, Suite 200, Columbus, Ohio 43215. The structure at this address is known as the Wyandotte Building, and was built 1894–97. Designed by Daniel Hudson Burnham, FAIA, the eleven story \\"Chicago School\\" Commercial Style structure is identified in Architecture: Columbus as the city's first steel-framed skyscraper.Architecture: Columbus; 1976; Robert E. Samuelson, Pasquale C. Grado, Judith L. Kitchen, Jeffrey T. Darbee; The Foundation of The Columbus Chapter of The American Institute of Architects, Columbus, Ohio; page 75 The Chapter initially occupied the smaller eastern half of the second floor, shared with two elevator shafts. A few years later, the office moved to the larger suite on the western side of the two-story atrium and elevator lobby, with Diane Deane [Executive Director 2004–2008] serving as Executive Director. A decade later, on December 30, 2009, the chapter moved its offices to much larger quarters at 380 East Broad Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215. This building is a former automobile dealership (Byers Chrysler-Plymouth), and housed the first home of the Center for Architecture and Design. A juried design competition for the facility was administered by the Columbus Neighborhood Design Assistance Center in early 2009. The competition winner was Lincoln Street Studio. This space proved too ambitious for the capital campaign effort. In December 2012, after a foundation-led capital campaign and four months of construction, the chapter and foundation moved into new quarters in the Lazarus Government Center operated by the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC) at 50 West Town Street, Suite 110, Columbus Ohio. The foundation holds the lease with CDDC and subleases a pro-rated portion of the space to the chapter. The two organizations have a management agreement in place that structures the relationship and use of staff resources. The Chapter's current Executive Director and Statutory Agent is Elizabeth Krile [Executive Director 2017 to present]. = State component = In 1891, there was an Ohio Chapter of the AIA that reported 45 members, including 30 Fellows of the Institute, and described problems with competing with local chapters for membership. The chapter reported that it held one meeting a year. Included in the Fellows were J.M. Freese, H.A. Linthwaite, and J.W. Yost of Columbus. The report also indicated that G.H. Maetzel of Columbus died in the previous year.Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Annual Convention of the American Institute of Architects; 1892; Dankmar Adler, Editor; Inland Architect Press, Chicago, Illinois; page 97 At the Annual Convention in 1892, J. W. Yost of Columbus offered a resolution requesting the Board of Directors to suggest to the local chapters that they endeavor to form state organizations that might advance the interests of architects in the various state legislatures. Mr. Yost's motion was seconded and referred to the Board of Directors.Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Annual Convention of the American Institute of Architects; 1892; Dankmar Adler, Editor; Inland Architect Press, Chicago, Illinois; pages 38-39 The Chapter is affiliated with a state component currently known as AIA Ohio, A Society of the American Institute of Architects. It was previously called the Architect's Society of Ohio (ASO). The state component was formed shortly after the Chapter, and an item in The Ohio Architect Engineer and Builder identifies January 18 and 19 of 1916 at the Virginia Hotel in Columbus as the first annual meeting of the Ohio Association of Architects, originally organized as the Ohio Association of Chapters of the Institute. Officers included George M. Anderson of Cincinnati, president; C.W. Bellows of Columbus, vice president; and Herbert B. Briggs of Cleveland, secretary-treasurer. The first item of business for the new organization was to advise the Office Building Commission on engaging an advisor for a building proposed for the statehouse grounds.\\"Ohio State Association of Architects\\" and \\"Ohio's New Office Building\\", The Ohio Architect Engineer and Builder; February, 1916; The Ohio News Bureau Co., Cleveland, Ohio; page 21 The state component describes itself as a federation of the seven AIA chapters in the state and continues to focus on legislative advocacy issues.

The long line extends from Frankfurt Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) to Eschhofen, a borough of Limburg an der Lahn. From Frankfurt to Niedernhausen, it operates as Rhine- Main S-Bahn S-2 and carries Deutsche Bahn route number 645.2. From Frankfurt Central Station to Frankfurt-Höchst, it also carries S-Bahn S-1 (which then follows the Taunus railway to Wiesbaden). From Niedernhausen to Eschhofen, it takes over Route number 627 from the Ländches Railway (Ländchesbahn). From Eschhofen, the line leads into the Lahn Valley Railway (Lahntalbahn). History A middle route through the Taunus between the Main and Lahn River valleys had been considered since 1850. However, construction was only begun under Prussian rule on 25 March 1872. The concession was awarded to the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn, or HLB). The construction began from Eschhofen and each finished section initially served mainly to transport material to the construction further forward. The first section between Eschhofen and Niederselters was opened to traffic on 1 February 1875. The entire track was completed on 15 October 1877. The line from Niedernhausen to Wiesbaden Central Station, called the Ländchesbahn Railway, was launched on 1 July 1879. Between 1911 and 1913, the single-track line was converted to double track. In 1971, the track was electrified between Frankfurt-Höchst and Niedernhausen, and in 1986 between Niedernhausen and Limburg. Eastern portal of the old Eppstein tunnel Starting in 2009 the tunnel in Eppstein was replaced with a new tunnel because the old tunnel needed to be restored urgently and doing this with full operation of services would have led to years of disruption of rail services. In addition, a new tunnel would be cheaper in the long run, as a new concrete lining inside the tunnel would reduce the cross-section to the extent that it could no longer be operated as two tracks, and therefore a new tunnel would have to be built for traffic in the opposite direction anyway. The line was rerouted through the new tunnel during the Easter of 2013 and the old tunnel was subsequently filled. In this context, Eppstein station is being rebuilt. The old station, which is a heritage-listed building, is no longer used by the railway. It was refurbished in 2007 and is now used as a government shopfront and a restaurant. The freight hall, which was also a heritage-listed building, has been demolished. Operations The operation of steam locomotives ended in 1972. In 1978, S-Bahn line S 2 opened between Frankfurt Hbf and Niedernhausen. The S-Bahn line is operated with class 423 electric multiple units. Regionalbahn RB 22 (hourly) and Regional-Express RE 20 (every two hours on weekdays) services have been operated mainly by DB Regio with class 143 locomotives since early 2006 and modern double-deck carriages since 2008. In addition RB 21 services run every two hours (less on the weekend) on the section from Limburg to Niedernhausen are operated with Siemens Desiro Classic sets by Hessische Landesbahn, continuing over the Ländches Railway to Wiesbaden.

Casseus was a frequent collaborator with Harry Belafonte who recorded his song \\"Merci Bon Dieu\\".https://www.marcribot.com/frantz-casseus Between 1953 and 1969, Casseus recorded three albums for Smithsonian Folkways. Casseus wrote music until the last years of his life, but from the 1970s tendonitis in his left hand curtailed his performance and recording career. Casseus was an early guitar teacher to the American musician Marc Ribot (b. 1954), whose aunt and uncle were friends of Casseus. Ribot has played a significant role in preserving Casseus' musical legacy.Ribot, Marc. \\"Frantz Casseus\\", BOMB Magazine, Winter, 2003. As part of these efforts, Ribot edited a collection of Casseus' solo guitar compositions,Ribot, Marc (2003). The Complete Works of Frantz Casseus, Tuscany Publications. and performed those same pieces on a CD issued in 1993.Ribot, Marc (1993). Marc Ribot Plays Solo Guitar Works of Frantz Casseus [CD].

Design The bomb was designed for aerial bombardment and maximum efficiency after being dropped. Therefore, the bomb had a very thin metal sheet as its only cover, as little as . The bomb is approximately in diameter, with a nose the shape of a hemisphere. The M107 bomb fuse at the nose of the bomb detonated the weapon, allowing for the release of the contents inside. The bomb is designed to carry either white phosphorus (WP) or a mustard agent (H). However, the H bomb filler was found to leak from the bomb when loaded, and the M47 and its variant M47A1 were not allowed to be loaded. This was due to the thin steel walls on the weapon. In storage and handling, both corrosion and rough handling were found to cause the bomb to leak. When the bomb is loaded with the chemical filler H, it weighs approximately , of which are from H. The M47 bomb can also be used as an incendiary device as well.Morgan, Stephen L. Chemical Warfare: History and Chemistry\\", University of South Carolina, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, accessed January 3, 2009.McArthur, Charles W. Operations Analysis in the U.S. Army Eighth Air Force in World War II, (Google Books), American Mathematical Society, 1990, p. 65, (). A mixture of rubber and gasoline can be used in the field to produce a crude incendiary bomb. A mixture of white phosphorus and jelled gasoline also produces a flammable mixture. Other mixtures include: LA-60 in which crude latex is combined with caustic soda, coconut oil, and water, crepe rubber (CR) in which crude latex reduced to a solid by precipitation and kneading, LA-100 in which crude latex is dried until it is 100% solid, smoked rubber sheets (SR) in which crude latex that has been dried over a fire until it is 100% solid. When used with these fillers, the bomb uses a black powder charge to ignite and scatter the incendiary materials. The bomb typically weighs about when the incendiary fillers are used. Variants The M47A1 was designed to replace the M47. It has a thicker steel cover that is about thick and an acid resistant corrosion cover inside. The M47A2 was designed to fix the leaking problems of the M47 when the agent H was carried. On the inside it was coated with a special oil that protected against corrosion from the agent H.

It currently offers a purse of $100,000. History From its inaugural running in 1977 to 1986, the event was run on the dirt course, but was moved to the turf course beginning in 1987. The race is named for the Mint Julep, a popular drink with racing fans at Churchill Downs, particularly seen on Kentucky Derby day. The event was split into divisions in 1987 and 1990. Between 1983 and 2004 the conditions of the event were for fillies and mares that were four year olds and older. In 2001 the event was upgraded to a Grade III. From 2001 to 2014 the event was known as the Early Time Mint Julep Handicap.

The four-room house is so named because its floor plan is divided into four sections, although not all four are proper rooms, one often being an unroofed courtyard. It is also sometimes called a pillared house because two—or all three—of the parallel ground-level \\"rooms\\" are separated by one—or two, respectively—rows of wooden pillars. The pillars, however, are not the defining feature of the four-room house, and this error of terminology leads to the confusion of four-room houses with other buildings, such as storehouses and stables, where pillars were widely used, but which were not constructed under the four-room house layout. When an upper floor was included, the inhabitants used it as living quarters, while the ground floor was used as a stable for livestock and for storage. There were multiple variations on the basic four-room house. Some had a five-, three-, or two-room layout, and sometimes the rooms were divided by additional walls into smaller areas. Acknowledging these sub-types of the four-room house, the popularity of the structure started at the beginning of Iron Age I (end of the eleventh century BCE) and dominated the architecture of Israel through Iron Age II until the Babylonian Exile. After the destruction of Judah (of the seventh and sixth centuries BCE) the architecture type was no longer utilized. Analysis There have been multiple theories on why the four-room house construction was so popular. Architectural analysis can be made of the residential units by the way they are grouped, the relationship between structures, their size, internal divisions, and the size and structure of the families that inhabited them. Various points can be made about the four-room house pertaining to the culture of their inhabitants. Disparity in house sizes and build quality within towns seem to be a result of socio- economic stratification within cities. Four-roomed houses are found in isolation or built in clusters of grouped units. It can be observed that smaller urban houses, that shared walls between them, were most likely inhabited by nuclear families, while the larger stand-alone houses belonged to extended and wealthy families such as the urban elite. Through the analysis of space syntax within the four-room house, it can be said that the four-room house reflects an egalitarian ideology. The typical four-room house had a layout where all the inner rooms were directly accessible from the house's central space, suggesting that all rooms were equal and there was no hierarchy to the space. The four-room house was unlike the typical Canaanite-Phoenician dwelling, which had a layout where some rooms could be entered only by passing through other rooms, hence showing a hierarchy of access. Although sometimes considered particularly Israelite, this idea has been challenged. Ziony Zevit writes that although \\"[t]he Iron Age pillared houses, the \\"four-room house,\\" are not uniquely Israelite\\", listing up several Iron Age non-Israelite sites where such houses were found, he nevertheless states that they are unlike the older, \\"Late Bronze II pillared house discovered at Tel Batash\\", and finally concludes that, all considered, \\"they are characteristic of Israelite sites.\\" Their origins are uncertain.Ji, Chang-Ho C. \\"A Note on the Iron Age Four-Room House in Palestine.\\" Orientalia, vol. 66, no. 4, 1997, pp. 387–413. NOVA SERIES, www.jstor.org/stable/43078144. Building patterns and materials Through archaeological excavations and anthropological studies, it is possible to report on building materials and possible methods used in the construction of the Israelite four-room houses. The Iron I four-room houses typically measured ten to twelve meters long and eight to ten meters wide. The floor plan consists of three axial rooms, connected by one “broadroom\\" at the rear of the building. Although a majority of houses were not found standing, through analysis it can be concluded that some houses stood two stories tall. Not all four-room houses were stand-alone houses in the typical American sense. While some houses were found in isolation, other houses were found with shared walls, and even shared the back broadroom wall with a thicker, outer, defensive city wall. The houses could be constructed in a circular pattern, where the outer city wall connected all back broadroom walls, such as in a combination of the casemate wall and the residential wall. The normal walls were around one meter thick, and were constructed of fieldstones. The exterior defensive walls were thicker. The surfaces of exterior walls were likely plastered to prevent erosion from rainfall, which could be heavy and intense in the winter and spring of the region. The plastering would have demanded a significant quantity of lime to be manufactured, which required a kiln. The floors were composed of beaten earth and flagstone pavement. Finely layered ash and clay helped keep the floors smooth and level. As seen by the sheer volume and weight of all of the stones, wooden pillars, and mudbrick walls used in the construction of the four-room house, it can be said that construction was a team effort that took a lot of energy.

He is also Emeritus Professorial Fellow at Mansfield College, Oxford. Between 2013 and 2015, he was Professor of Political Theory in the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Nottingham.https://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff109102.php He is a leading theorist of ideology and the founding editor of the Journal of Political Ideologies. Study of ideologies Freeden has been noted for his analysis of contemporary ideologies. He has rejected the traditional definition of ideologies, which sees the latter as static \\"belief systems\\" and instead bases his analysis on modern semantics. Just like languages, ideologies consist of certain concepts whose meaning may change and evolve over time. The specific relations between ideological concepts may be analyzed by being set in their respective semantic fields. Each ideology may be seen as having both \\"core\\" concepts (that is, those of the highest importance, e.g. class conflict in Marxism or freedom in liberalism) and \\"peripheral\\" (or secondary) concepts. Concepts may gain or lose importance over time, just as new concepts may emerge (or be borrowed from other ideologies) or fall out of use entirely. Different ideologies may give different meanings to the same term (a concept such as equality will have a material definition in Marxism while in liberalism it will rather have a legal and political importance). In this sense, concepts are defined by their relation to other concepts. According to Freeden, it is precisely these conceptual relations that should attract our attention as they will be likely to evolve in the long term. By studying the conceptual evolution of ideologies, Freeden observes that the relative \\"political success\\" of an ideology depends on its ability to impose the belief that its own conceptual definitions are the \\"correct ones\\". This gives rise to a form of \\"conceptual competition\\", in which each ideology performs a continuous \\"decontestation\\" of its concepts; that is, it tries to eliminate all possible contestation of its own conceptual definitions, thereby rejecting competing definitions (Marxism will thus reject private property as a product of the exploitative nature of capitalism, just as liberalism may view state intervention as an infringement of individual freedoms). This decontestation is not only the product of an inter-ideological competition (between ideologies), but it is also the product of an intra-ideological competition (within ideologies): hence the success of Friedrich Hayek's form of neoliberalism during the 1980s, or of the Marxist–Leninist trend in the 1920s.

He made his professional debut in 1999 and broke into the top makuuchi division nine years later in 2008. His highest rank was maegashira 6. He wrestled for Kokonoe stable. After admitting his involvement in match-fixing, he retired from the sport in 2011 following an investigation by the Japan Sumo Association. Career At high school he preferred judo, and had little sumo experience, but his judo teacher was a friend of Kokonoe-oyakata, the 58th yokozuna Chiyonofuji. After being introduced he joined Kokonoe stable, making his professional debut in March 1999. His stablemate, Chiyotaikai, made his debut at the rank of ōzeki in the same tournament. He initially fought under his own surname, before adopting the shikona of Chiyohakuhō in November 1999. (He has no connection to the better known wrestler Hakuhō, who did not make his debut until March 2001.) He was first promoted to the third highest makushita division in November 2001. Chiyohakuhō slowly climbed the makushita division and upon taking his first tournament championship in January 2005 with a perfect 7-0 record from the rank of makushita 4 he earned automatic promotion to the elite sekitori ranks. However, he had to pull out of his debut tournament in the second highest jūryō division with an injury and fell back to makushita. He did not re- establish himself as a sekitori wrestler until May 2007. After six unremarkable tournaments he took the jūryō division championship with a 13-2 record in May 2008, and this was just enough to earn him promotion to the top makuuchi division at the lowest rank of maegashira 16. Chiyohakuhō in May 2009 Chiyohakuhō came through with a bare majority of eight wins against seven losses in his top division debut in July 2008. He could only manage six wins in the next tournament but remained in the division, and a score of 9-6 in November pushed him up to maegashira 9 for the January 2009 tournament. He recorded six wins against nine losses there. Falling to maegashira 13, he produced a strong 10-5 record in March, which sent him up to what was to be his highest rank of maegashira 6. He made a good start to the May 2009 tournament but was forced to pull out after damaging knee ligaments in his Day 4 defeat to Kisenosato. He was demoted back to the jūryō division for July 2009 as a result. He was unable to secure an immediate return to the top division, scoring only 7-8 in the July tournament. In September 2009 he withdrew once again after winning only three bouts in the first ten days, and he remained in jūryō after that. Controversy In September 2008 Chiyohakuhō was the only wrestler who did not take part in the surprise drug tests of the seventy sekitori that led to the dismissals of Rohō and Hakurozan. In June 2009, along with other members of the Kokonoe stable and four other sables, he was tested, and he expressed his relief at finally having done so. He was suspended along with over a dozen other wrestlers from the July 2010 tournament after admitting involvement in illegal betting on baseball. As a result, he fell to the makushita division in September. This also left Kokonoe stable without any sekitori. However, he scored 6-1 from the rank of makushita 5 , enough for an immediate return to jūryō. In February 2011, Chiyohakuhō reportedly admitted to fixing or throwing bouts in which he was involved in advance, after police investigating the baseball affair found text messages on his mobile phone apparently arranging the outcome of matches and discussing payments.Hongo, Jun, and Natsuko Fukue, \\"Three admit to throwing sumo bouts\\", Japan Times, 4 February 2011, p.1. On February 4, he tendered his resignation to the Japan Sumo Association. However, no decision on his future was made until an investigation into the affair by an independent panel concluded on April 1, when the Sumo Association announced the \\"advised retirements\\" of 21 wrestlers and two coaches. Because he admitted his involvement Chiyohakuhō was given a two-year suspension instead, along with coach Takenawa (former maegashira Kasuganishiki) and suspected go-between Enatsukasa. However, his letter of resignation was accepted. Chiyohakuho gave a public apology, saying \\"I'm very sorry for causing trouble to the JSA and sumo fans.\\" Fighting style Like his stablemate Chiyotaikai, Chiyohakuhō favoured pushing and thrusting techniques, as opposed to grabbing the opponent's mawashi. His most common winning techniques were oshidashi, the push-out, hatakikomi, the slap down, and tsukiotoshi, the thrust over.

Quinn spent almost 30 years in senior front office positions in Major League Baseball and worked as the general manager of three clubs: the New York Yankees (from June 8, 1988, through October 12, 1989), Cincinnati Reds (from October 13, 1989, through the end of the season) and San Francisco Giants (from December 1, 1992, through September 30, 1996). He was the general manager of the World Series champion Cincinnati Reds. Family Quinn is a third-generation member of a family involved in baseball management since the turn of the 20th century. His grandfather J.A. Robert Quinn at one time was an owner of the Boston Red Sox and Boston Braves and general manager of the St. Louis Browns and Brooklyn Dodgers. His father, John J. Quinn, was GM of the Braves in Boston and Milwaukee and the Philadelphia Phillies between 1945 and 1972. A brother-in- law, Roland Hemond, is also a longtime baseball executive and the former general manager of the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles. And Quinn's son, also named Bob, served from 2003 until early 2018 as the Milwaukee Brewers' executive vice president, finance and administration,Milwaukee Brewers official web site the fourth generation of the Quinn family to work in senior management positions in professional baseball. Robert E. Quinn grew up in Newton, Massachusetts, and was 17 when he moved with his family to Milwaukee with the Braves in 1953. He graduated from Marquette University in 1958Marquette University and began his baseball career in the Braves' and Phillies' minor league organizations. In 1967, he helped establish the Reading Phillies as Philadelphia's Eastern League farm team, winning The Sporting News' Minor League Executive of the Year Award as a first-year general manager there. Reading celebrated its 50th straight year as the Phillies' Double-A affiliate in 2016. Quinn then helped to re-establish a minor league franchise in Omaha in 1969–70 as the first front-office boss of the Omaha Royals of the Triple-A American Association. That franchise celebrated its 50th consecutive season as the Kansas City Royals' top affiliate in 2018. Quinn joined Milwaukee's current Major League team, the Brewers, as their farm system director in 1971. In 1973, he accepted a similar post with the Cleveland Indians, and spent over a dozen years working as the Indians' scouting and player development boss. He was promoted to vice president in 1981. Career as general managerNew York Yankees= In 1987, Quinn joined the Yankees as vice president, baseball administration. In May 1988, the Bombers' incumbent GM, Lou Piniella, turned in his resignation; on June 8, Quinn was named his successor. Not even two weeks into his tenure, Quinn faced a mutiny from the manager he inherited, Billy Martin. Quinn had activated a catcher, Don Slaught, from the disabled list based on input from the Yankees' medical staff. Martin disagreed vehemently with the Slaught decision and announced he would boycott the team's management meetings. Owner George Steinbrenner did not intercede on Martin's behalf, and Martin was replaced by Piniella as manager on June 23 with the Yankees 40–28 and 2½ games behind the Detroit Tigers in the American League East Division. They went only 45–48 under Piniella to finish fifth in , then posted a 74–87 mark in , their first losing season since , and Quinn resigned October 12. =Cincinnati Reds= Quinn immediately succeeded Murray Cook as general manager of the Cincinnati Reds, and he proceeded to hire Piniella as his field manager. The 1989 Cincinnati season had been a disaster on and off the field: the Reds finished 75–87 and in fifth place in a year marred by the gambling allegations against and the suspension and disbarment of manager Pete Rose. During that offseason, Quinn acquired fireballing relief pitcher Randy Myers and rookie first baseman Hal Morris. In 1990, Morris posted a .340 batting average and finished third in the National League Rookie of the Year balloting. Myers teamed with Rob Dibble and Norm Charlton to form The Nasty Boys, a formidable bullpen trio. The 1990 Reds won 91 games and the National League West Division championship, defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in six games in the NLCS (with Morris hitting .417), and then swept the favored Oakland Athletics in the World Series behind The Nasty Boys' dominant relief work. Quinn was named \\"Executive of the Year\\" by The Sporting News in recognition of Cincinnati's 1990 turnaround. The Reds suffered a down season in , falling to fifth place, but recovered to win 90 games in , although they finished eight games behind the division champion Atlanta Braves. But there was turbulence in the Cincinnati front office. Owner Marge Schott cut Quinn's scouting and farm system budget, then fired him at the end of the 1992 season. =San Francisco Giants= Two months later, Quinn became general manager of the Giants at one of the turning points in their history in the San Francisco Bay Area. The 1992 Giants finished 72–90, 26 games behind the Braves (and 18 games in arrears of Quinn's Reds) and had drawn 1.56 million fans to Candlestick Park—next to last in the National League. For much of the season, it appeared that the Giants were about to move to Tampa–Saint Petersburg after owner Bob Lurie agreed to sell them to Florida businessman Vince Naimoli. But in November, the National League rejected the Tampa deal, and Lurie instead sold the Giants to a Bay Area investment group headed by Peter Magowan. The new owners announced the team was staying in San Francisco, hired Quinn as general manager on December 1, 1992, signed free agent superstar left fielder Barry Bonds on December 9, and promoted Dusty Baker to manager on December 16. The 1993 Giants proceeded to improve by 31 games, going 103–59, Bonds won the NL Most Valuable Player Award, and attendance jumped to 2.6 million. However, the Giants finished a game behind the Braves in the NL West and did not qualify for the postseason in the last pre-wild card full season in Major League Baseball. Three sub-.500 seasons followed the Giants' 1993 breakout year, and at the close of , Quinn stepped down as general manager. His successor was assistant general manager/director of player personnel Brian Sabean, the former director of scouting of the Yankees who had followed Quinn to the Giants' organization in 1993. Under Sabean, GM from 1997 through 2014, the Giants would win three World Series championships and four National League pennants. Under Magowan they moved into AT&T; Park in and solidified their popularity in the Bay Area. Quinn remained with the Giants as a vice president and senior adviser through 1997. He currently resides in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Known locally as \\"Peter Brown,\\" he was a candidate for the 2009 Houston mayoral race, to succeed then Mayor Bill White, who vacated the position due to term limits. Although an independent poll conducted by 11 News/ KUHF Houston Public Radio poll in late October 2009 showed Brown holding the lead in the mayor's race with a nine-point lead over his nearest opponent, he was eliminated in the November 3, 2009, election. Education and professional career Brown grew up in Riverside Terrace in Houston, just north of Brays Bayou, in the North McGregor part of town, and attended St. John's School. He graduated with a Bachelors from the University of Houston, and went on to earn a master's degree in Languages from University of California, Berkeley. Upon graduation, Brown enlisted in the U.S. Army. After a year of active service, Brown entered the active reserves while attending the University of Pennsylvania. There, he earned master's degrees in architecture and urban planning. Today, he is the only city council member in Houston to have served in the U.S. military. Brown began his career as an architect and urban planner in 1966, working on major projects in the northeast United States. In 1982 he moved back to Houston, and became a partner in an architecture and planning firm. A year later, he would found his own firm, which he grew into a successful national business. In 2003, Brown was elevated to Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, the profession’s highest distinction. As an architect, has designed many municipal facilities, including affordable housing and traditional neighborhoods, fire and police stations, parks and recreation centers, jails and courthouses, libraries and health clinics, transit stations, and theaters. Brown also served as an adjunct professor in the Department of Urban Planning & Environmental Policy graduate program at Texas Southern University. Brown direced the Better Houston membership organization focused on improvements to local neighborhoods, transit, and urbanism. Political career Brown first ran for an at-large seat on Houston City Council in 2003 against incumbent Council Woman Shelley Sekula-Gibbs. Brown narrowly lost to Sekula-Gibbs, receiving 48.5% of the vote, and raising more money than any previous city council candidate. In 2005, Brown ran again and won his seat, at-large position 1. In 2007, he was re-elected to his second term. thumbleft220px Brown chats with Mayor White moments before a press conference to announce a new single-stream recycling pilot program. Starting when he took office in 2006, Brown was a neighborhood advocate, working for better street standards, making the city pedestrian-friendly, and instrumental in the creation of the Houston General Plan and the Houston Mobility Plan, and was involved in the creation of the Old Sixth Ward historic district. Brown publicly supported a decentralized form of municipal government, and recently unveiled plans to decentralize the city government, and bring city services closer to neighborhoods. \\"We're a big, spread-out city and trying to run everything from a central, one central source, say downtown is not very cost-effective. To decentralize neighborhood services is something I think we need to take a close look at.\\" Brown also supported a decentralized, restructured police department, saying that with centralized systems, “there is no accountability.” Brown has called this situation a “leadership opportunity for the next mayor to plow new ground.” He also promoted and worked for more \\"green\\" initiatives including recycling, urban gardens and farming, and air quality standards. In January 2008, Mayor Bill White appointed Brown to Chair the newly created Council Committee on Sustainable Growth. The committee considers strategies to promote environmental health, energy efficiency, and conservation of natural resources in the city of Houston. In October 2008, the Sustainable Growth Committee successfully initiated a program to recycle heavy organic yard waste which is expected to salvage annually, enough to fill the Chase Tower, the city's tallest structure. This, plus a new program to recycle scrap tires, will save Houston taxpayers over $1 million annually. Brown appeared live on several news channels to speak on the city’s hurricane recovery efforts. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ike, Brown advocated for the importance of retrofitting the city’s electrical infrastructure. The hurricane cut electric power to millions of customers in the Houston area for weeks. Brown called for the largest energy provider in Houston, CenterPoint Energy, to bury their overhead power lines and harden the city’s electrical grid to prevent similar mass power outages from occurring in the future. =Houston mayoral race= In January 2008, Brown announced the creation of his mayoral exploratory committee.http://www.hcnonline.com/articles/2009/02/15/west_university_examiner/news/wu_houston_mayors.txt Since that announcement, Brown has received the public support and endorsement of several organizations and community leaders. On February 26, 2009, Brown officially announced his candidacy for Mayor of Houston, and succeed current term limited Mayor White, before supporters at Hermann Park in Houston. Other candidates include former City Attorney Gene Locke, Roy Morales, and City Controller Annise Parker. Brown has focused much of his campaign around his experience as a businessman, architect and urban planner, and his \\"Blueprint for An Even Better Houston,\\" which his campaign says \\"offers real solutions and real ideas for combatting traffic, crime, flooding and other challenges.\\" The blueprint details policy agendas pertaining to the economy, public safety, transportation, flooding, energy, government efficiency and reform, and the environment. Although his opponents are generally acknowledged to be more polished public speakers than he is, and some of them been politicians for much longer - building high name identification - observers have acknowledged that Brown seems to have outworked his opponents. The Chronicle's Rick Casey praised Brown's \\"energy\\" and wrote \\"Brown has campaigned harder and longer than any other candidate.\\" Brown's mayoral campaign reported raising over $477,000 in the first half of 2009, bringing his cash on hand amount at the time to $1.7 million, more than three times what his opponents reported. An independent poll conducted by the Houston Chronicle in late September showed Brown ahead of all of his opponents. A secondary independent poll conducted by 11 News/ KUHF Houston Public Radio poll in late October 2009, still showed Brown with a nine-point lead over his nearest opponent. Although many independent polls showed Brown holding the lead in the mayor's race, he was eliminated in the November 3, 2009 election. The next week Brown publicly endorsed his former opponent, Annise Parker, in the mayor's race, an endorsement that was heavily sought after by both remaining candidates. Parker went on to win the mayor's race and was sworn in as mayor on January 4, 2010. =Mayoral results=Electoral history200320052007=External links * Peter Brown's website at the City of Houston * Peter Brown for Mayor Campaign Website * Peter Brown for Mayor Facebook * Peter Brown for Mayor Twitter * * Mayoral candidate Peter Brown to strengthen neighborhood council * Defender News: Councilman Peter Brown prepares to run for mayor * Race for Houston mayor starts early * Intown Magazine: Meet Council Member Peter Brown * PERSPECTIVE: Peter Brown  Houston City Councilman * Change Magazine: Peter Brown's Recycling Competition Heats Up References Category:University of Houston alumni Category:Houston City Council members Category:2017 deaths Category:1936 births Category:Texas Democrats ","title":"Peter Hoyt Brown"},{"id":"20905657","text":"The Perry Lumber Company was an early 20th-century company which owned timberland in Perry County, Pennsylvania. The company was organized by Harrisburg businessmen about 1900.Kohler & Weinschenker, p. 38 By December 1901, they had acquired eleven tracts of forested land near the border with Franklin County. They planned to produce various types of sawn lumber products, as well as extract wood for a tannery in Newport. The owners of the lumber company originally hoped to have the Newport and Shermans Valley Railroad converted to standard gauge to facilitate shipment,Kohler & Weinschenker, p. 40 but they were unable to come to terms with the N&SV;'s owner, David Gring. As a result, when Perry Lumber began constructing a railroad into their timberlands, they built it to the narrow gauge of the N&SV.;Kohler & Weinschenker, p. 42 The Perry Lumber Railroad used part of a roadbed originally cleared and graded by the Path Valley Railroad. Beginning at New Germantown, where it connected with the N&SV;, it followed the Path Valley grade to Bryner's farm. There it turned between Trostle and Skinner Ridges and climbed up behind and around Trostle Ridge, along what is now Bowman Trail. It then made another sharp turn and dropped down between Rising Mountain and Buck Ridge on a 5.5% grade, now the Perry Lumber Road. At the base of the descent, a branch ran southwest about down Fowler Hollow Run along the present Perry Lumber Road. The main line turned and ran up Fowler Hollow Run to Shultz Run, where a company sawmill was located. It continued up the run and climbed between Amberson Ridge and Shultz Ridge alongside the present Couch Road. Running southwest along the south side of Amberson Ridge, it ended at Couch Camp, near Shaeffer Run.Kohler & Weinschenker, p. 44 The entire railroad was about in length. The company owned one Class B 25-ton Climax locomotive,Kline, p. 195 Alfarata, which was housed in a crude enginehouse at New Germantown. The N&SV; shops built thirty lumber cars for the lumber company.Kohler & Weinschenker, p. 43 Portable sawmills were moved along the right-of-way as necessary to saw the timber.Kline, p. 172 The principal trees logged by the company were white pine, white oak, chestnut, and hemlock. While lumber was the principal product of the company, chestnut, hemlock, and oak bark were also shipped as extract wood to Newport. The timber was logged out in 1905, and the company closed up, selling the lumber cars to the N&SV; and the engine to the East Waterford Lumber Company. In April 1907, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought its land, establishing the McClure Division of Tuscarora State Forest.Kohler & Weinschenker, p. 45 Part of the grade also lies within Fowlers Hollow State Park.

Wone, who was 32 years old at the time, was a lawyer living in suburban Oakton, Virginia, but had been working as general counsel at Radio Free Asia in downtown Washington, D.C. He had stayed the night at the home of friends located about one mile from his office. According to police affidavits, Wone was believed to have been \\"restrained, incapacitated, and sexually assaulted\\" before his death. The residents of the home Joe Price, Victor Zaborsky, and Dylan Ward contended that the murder was committed by an intruder unknown to them; the trial judge found this unbelievable. Within days of the murder, D.C. police alleged that the crime scene had been tampered with, but no charges were filed for over two years. In late 2008, police charged Price, Zaborsky, and Ward with obstruction of justice and conspiracy related to alleged tampering with the crime scene. The men were acquitted of the charges in June 2010. No one has been charged with Wone's killing. In November 2008, Wone's widow, Katherine Wone, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Price, Zaborsky, and Ward; the suit was settled on August 3, 2011, for an undisclosed sum and agreement.  Crime  Late on August 2, 2006, Robert Eric Wone was fatally stabbed while staying overnight at a Swann Street, NW rowhouse in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C., owned by Joseph Price (aka Joseph Anderson) and his domestic partner Victor Zaborsky, where they lived with Dylan Ward (aka Dylan Thomas) in a polyamourous BDSM relationship as a family. Wone had gone to Price's residence at approximately 10:30 PM after working late, as had been arranged days before. Neighbors reported hearing a scream, later identified as Zaborsky's, during the 11:00 PM newscast (i.e., before 11:35 PM). Zaborsky made a 9-1-1 call at 11:49 PM, and paramedics arrived five minutes later, followed by the police. Price phoned Wone's wife, and Wone was pronounced dead at George Washington University Hospital at 12:24 AM on August 3. Price, Zaborsky, and Ward all initially spoke with the police without attorneys, and video recordings of those interviews were shown at the subsequent conspiracy trial. They denied any involvement in the death and speculated that an intruder had killed Wone. The three also denied any sexual relationship with Wone, and Wone's family have described him as both \\"straight and happily married\\". All three men attended Wone's funeral, where Price served as a pallbearer. Eric Holder, who at that time worked at Covington & Burling, called Wone \\"a kind and gentle man\\" who was \\"killed in the most horrible of ways\\".  Investigation  The house where Wone was murdered at 1509 Swann St NW Paramedics responding to the emergency call \\"found the three residents’ calm behavior unusual; none were screaming or even helping direct the paramedics\\". According to Ward's attorney, detectives who interrogated the three housemates on the night of the murder informed them that they were the main suspects in the case, and asked many sexually charged, accusatory questions. Three days after the murder, the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit of the D.C. police were called in, but unit head Sgt. Brett Parson declined to discuss the unit's involvement. Within two weeks of the murder, police publicly alleged that the crime scene had been tampered with. (Registration required) Investigators spent more than three weeks examining the townhouse in detail, \\"removing flooring, pieces of walls, a chunk of staircase, the washing machine, even sink traps\\". Allegations that the area around Wone's body had been cleaned were revealed in an affidavit in support of a search warrant for homeowner Joseph Price's offices at the D.C. law firm of Arent Fox. = Burglary = Three months after Wone's death, Price's brother and an accomplice burgled the Swann Street residence; they took more than $7,000 of electronic equipment. Two individuals, including Price's brother, were charged with the burglary, but those charges were later dropped. In 2007, D.C. police revealed that they had been preparing to make an arrest in the Wone murder case in 2006, but that the burglary had derailed those plans. Police have not revealed the name of the arrest target, nor the charge(s) that would have been filed. = Lack of progress = In August 2007, The Washington Post reported the frustration of Wone's widow, Katherine Wone, with the FBI crime lab: \\"It has been trying at times as we continue to wait for the FBI to complete their analysis of all the samples that were taken.\\" Over one year, the case had been transferred to three separate prosecutors, earning it \\"vagabond status\\" in the U.S. Attorneys' office. On the one-year anniversary of Wone's death, Katherine Wone held a press conference to appeal for public assistance in finding the killer, her first public comment on the case. During the press conference, Holder publicly pleaded with the three residents to provide additional information, saying \\"You need to ask yourself, 'Have I provided police with all the information I know?'\\" Interested parties, such as the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA), used the first anniversary of Wone's death to criticize what they deemed police inaction in the investigation. In contrast to the first anniversary of Wone's murder, there was no press conference on the second anniversary, and neither the Wone family nor police made any statements to the press. = Arrests and charges = An obstruction of justice charge was filed in October 2008 against housemate Dylan Ward, who had since moved to Miami- Dade County, Florida, and was living in a home owned by Price. In November 2008, Price and Zaborsky were arrested and also charged with obstruction of justice. All three men were later released pending trial, but subject to electronic monitoring and curfews. On December 19, 2008, additional charges of conspiracy were filed against all three men. During the same hearing, the electronic monitoring and curfew restrictions for the three defendants were ended and prosecutors announced the possibility that charges related to tampering with evidence could be filed in the future. The affidavit filed by authorities supporting the arrest warrant for Ward showed that investigators had concluded the men were not telling the truth about what happened. The report states \\"The evidence demonstrates that Robert Wone was restrained, incapacitated, sexually assaulted, and murdered inside 1509 Swann Street\\", and there exists \\"overwhelming evidence, far in excess of probable cause\\" that Price, Zaborsky, and Ward \\"obstructed justice by altering and orchestrating the crime scene, planting evidence, delaying the reporting of the murder to the authorities, and lying to the police about the true circumstances of the murder\\". Lawyers for the three accused men have called the affidavit \\"speculation, innuendo, assumptions, and irrelevant inflammatory comments\\" and maintain their clients' innocence. Price and Zaborsky were domestic partners, and the affidavit alleges that Price had previously had a sexual relationship with Ward. Washington attorney Dale Sanders opined that the release of the extensively detailed affidavit was intended to turn one of the housemates, presumably Ward, against the others, and hypothesized that it indicated prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to charge any of the housemates with additional crimes without the cooperation of a witness. Officials believe that a knife from the kitchen had been smeared with blood and placed near the body, while a duplicate of the knife that was missing from a set found in Ward's bedroom would have been more consistent with the wounds to Wone's body. The autopsy revealed evidence of some degree of suffocation, perhaps by a pillow, and puncture marks on his neck, chest, foot, and hand. Though no toxins were found in his blood, a lack of evidence of struggle led investigators to suspect Wone had been injected with a paralytic agent. Cadaver dogs found a blood residue in a dryer lint trap and the patio drain, which detectives believe may be evidence that someone washed themselves in the back patio area, and dried wet clothes in the dryer. Washington City Paper columnist Jason Cherkis reported unattributed criticism of the medical examiner's failure to test for exotic drugs and to keep a sample of Wone's blood for later testing, as well as detectives' failure to follow up on a lint trap that had attracted a cadaver dog's attention. Price's lawyer has challenged the timing of the indictments, has said that the civil suit \\"looked unseemly\\", and questioned whether the prosecutors and Wone family attorneys were acting in concert. In April 2009, prosecutors disclosed that two emails had been drafted on Wone's BlackBerry \\"at a time when prosecutors believed Wone dead\\". An independent criminal law attorney noted, \\"The defense will argue that this is consistent with their claim that the murder happened quickly by an intruder and it was not a long, drawn-out effort to sexually assault Wone before he was killed, as the government is alleging.\\" Previously, a court filing indicated that the government intended to release a personal profile that Price allegedly used on ALT.com, \\"a sexually oriented web site specializing in S&M; practices\\". Formal defense in the conspiracy case began on June 17, 2010, and concluded without any of the defendants testifying. Judge Lynn Leibovitz found each of the three men not guilty of charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and tampering with evidence on June 29, 2010. Leibovitz, in explaining her ruling for almost an hour from the bench, stated that she personally believed that the men knew who killed Wone, but was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that they committed the offenses with which they were charged. = Civil lawsuit = On November 25, 2008, Wone's widow Katherine filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the three men, largely based on the police affidavit. The lawsuit alleged \\"defendants' negligent failure to rescue Robert Wone after he was injured, defendants' destruction of evidence of Robert Wone's murder, and defendants' conspiracy to destroy evidence and obstruct the police investigation into Robert Wone's murder\\". The suit was settled August 3, 2011, for an undisclosed sum and agreement. Prior to his nomination as United States Attorney General, Eric Holder advised Wone's widow on a pro bono basis. (Section 26, near end of document)  Aftermath  Wone's death has proven to be one of Washington, D.C.'s most mysterious homicide cases. Washington Examiner listed the Wone case, in light of the arrests, as one of eight top crime stories in D.C. for 2008. Washington Blade stated that the case \\"has captured the interest of the gay community because it occurred inside the home of a prominent gay male couple\\". In March 2009, a MyFoxDC.com story on the crime highlighted a website cataloging the investigative efforts of \\"four amateur sleuths who live in the neighborhood\\". Since Wone's death, multiple organizations have established scholarships and other memorials in his name, including the Virginia Department of Social Services \\"Robert E. Wone Award for Exemplary Service;\\" the annual \\"Robert E. Wone Judicial Clerkship & Internship Conference,\\" which rotates among the D.C. area law schools, including Georgetown University Law Center, American University Washington College of Law, and Howard University School of Law; a workroom at OCA headquarters; the \\"Robert E. Wone Fellowship\\" of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association Educational Fund; the \\"Robert E. Wone Scholarship\\" of OCA's New Jersey Chapter; the \\"Robert E. Wone Memorial Trust,\\" administered by the Community Foundation of the National Capital Region; and the \\"Robert E. Wone Clinical Fellowship\\" at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, including a room in the law school's Civil Practice Clinic. On October 22, 2011, family and friends gathered at Barksdale Field at the College of William & Mary to dedicate two benches and two Chinese pistache trees in Wone's memory. The plaques on the benches read \\"Rest awhile and enjoy the wonderful world around you,\\" a reference to one of Wone's favorite songs by Louis Armstrong, \\"What a Wonderful World.\\"  Victim  Robert Eric Wone (June 1, 1974 August 3, 2006) was 32 years old when he was killed. He was a fourth generation Chinese American, born in Manhattan and raised in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from Xaverian High School as Valedictorian of his class, he attended the College of William & Mary as a James Monroe Scholar. There, Wone met Joseph Price, then a senior, in the 199293 academic year. Wone and Price shared several activities, including an honor society and student government leadership positions, before Price graduated in 1993. In September 1993, the Richmond Times-Dispatch published an opinion piece co-written by Wone, criticizing a prior Times-Dispatch article on William & Mary faculty. (Registration required) Wone graduated from the College of William & Mary in 1996, and then received his law degree with honors from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1999. He subsequently served as law clerk to Judge Raymond A. Jackson of the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Wone later worked in commercial real estate law for six years as an attorney with the Washington, D.C. law firm of Covington & Burling. As part of his public service responsibilities with the law firm, Wone served as general counsel for the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA). On June 7, 2003, Wone married Katherine Ellen Yu, and the couple lived in Fairfax County. On June 30, 2006, about two months before he was killed, Wone left Covington & Burling and was hired as general counsel for Radio Free Asia. (Registration required) Wone was very active within the Asian American community, supporting organizations such as OCA and the Museum of Chinese in America. At the time of his death, he was president-elect of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association.

Powerlifting career By the time Clark was 13, he was lifting 110-pound cement weights. In 1986, Clark became the first teenager to bench press 600 pounds, and was notable for using a reverse grip on the bar. In 1992, he was the first lifter to bench press 700 using the reverse grip. On September 25, 1993, at the U.S. Powerlifting Federation (USPF) Northwest Open, Clark broke his own world record with a 735 lb lift. In May 1993 he had pressed 725 lb. After his record-breaking lift, Clark often referred to himself as the World's Strongest Man, and toured for a time performing feats of strength. On one occasion he pushed a 6,000–lb. elephant, in a heavy-duty wheelbarrow, across the floor in a strongman competition in Japan. In addition to that, Clark gave motivational speeches, seminars, and one-on-one counseling to motivate kids and prison inmates to improve their lives. Clark also claimed that he stopped using steroids at the age of 22, stating that all they did was to increase his blood pressure. He called his best friend Big Mike.

He was born in India, the son of a Scottish- born Customs and Excise inspector and an Indian woman. He wrestled in England under the name of The Mighty Chang. Film career As an actor, Reid was known for playing thugs, henchmen and brutes, typified by his role as Yen in the film Ferry to Hong Kong (1959) that starred Curd Jürgens and Orson Welles. He played the big pirate in Swiss Family Robinson (1960) and had a memorable role as the mute Mulatto in the Hammer film Captain Clegg (1962). Reid appeared in three James Bond films: as Dr. No's Guard in Dr. No (1962), as a temple guard in Casino Royale (1967), and as Sandor, Roger Moore's opponent in a roof top fight in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Reid also appeared as a henchman in the 1967 Bulldog Drummond film Deadlier Than the Male and as Eye Patch in the 1977 Bond spoof No. 1 of the Secret Service. Reid attempted to secure the role of Oddjob in Goldfinger (1964). He challenged fellow professional wrestler Harold \\"Tosh Togo\\" Sakata to a wrestling match; the outcome of which would determine who would get the role. As Reid had already appeared in Dr. No, the producers decided to go with Sakata, and the wrestling match did not take place. He appeared briefly as a circus strongman in The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, which was filmed in 1968 but delayed for release until 1996. In the early 1970s he appeared as a bodyguard in a TV commercial for St Bruno pipe tobacco, a role which he reprised in a spoof advert for \\"Butch\\" tobacco in Kitten Kong, an episode of the BBC series The Goodies. Reid also appeared in a handful of cult horror movies including Dr. Phibes Rises Again and Terror, fantasy/adventure films such as The People That Time Forgot and Arabian Adventure, and several British sex films such as Come Play with Me and Adventures of a Private Eye. Additionally Reid accepted non- sexual roles in a couple of hardcore porn films including Arabian Knights, shot in London in 1979 and released by Color Climax. Reid appeared in over 53 films and television programs from 1953 to 1979. He travelled back to India where his mother and sister resided, and he supposedly died of a heart attack in 1987, and his son was still receiving written correspondence from him in 1986. His death is something of a mystery due to the conflicting dates of death and also because he died in relative obscurity in India.

Lucraft was a public advocate of Chartism and a founder member, and sometime chairman, of the \\"General Council of First International\\" of the International Workingmen's Association. He was the only working-class man elected to the first London School Board in 1870 where he campaigned for free education for all, among other issues. He was a member, or officer, in a wide number of radical political movements of the 19th century. In 1874 he stood for election in Finsbury and in 1880 for Tower Hamlets; in both elections he was unsuccessful but was one of the forerunners of the Lib- Lab candidates who had their first electoral success in 1874. He died in 1897. Early life Benjamin Lucraft's family had settled in Broadclyst, Devon, in 1781 when his grandfather William Lucraft married Esther Newton in the parish church on 10 December 1781. Esther was the daughter of William Newton and Esther Leight, both Broadclyst families and Esther's grave still stands in the churchyard after her death in 1831, aged 71. The family had moved from the South Hams area of Devon in the 17th century. Lucraft was born on 28 November 1809, in Exeter, the second son of Lucraft and his wife Mary. His father Benjamin came from Broadclyst where he been a wood worker and possibly a chair-carver. Lucraft was baptised at St. Paul church Exeter on 16 December 1809. In 1819 around the age of 10 Lucraft was apprenticed in husbandry to his grandfather William according to his apprentice indenture. Some sources suggest that he was a ploughboy and was apprenticed in cabinet making at 14 years. The only story from this time is that he was later in life described as a boy reading the newspaper to his adult working colleagues on the farms where they worked. =Taunton to London= By 1830 Lucraft was living with his parents in Taunton in a house on North Street, and later on East Leech Street. Either his father or he himself worked as a cabinet maker at a workshop on the east side of High Street where he paid a rate of £7.10s 0d, qualifying for a vote. Lucraft and his family were cabinet makers and were also listed at High Street in 1830. While they were there the Poor relief gave his father 1s 1d in January 1830 and 1s 7d in February 1830 from the Poor Rate for buying stock. Lucraft married Mary Pearce, whose family also lived on East Leech, in St. Mary Magdalene Parish Church, Taunton, on 24 December 1830. When Mary and Lucraft had their first child they named him George Seely (sic) Lucraft. He was baptised at St. Mary's on 3 November 1831. Their second child died in 1832 and in January 1834 Lucraft, Mary and their son moved to Shoreditch in London, with Lucraft as a chair-carver, bringing with them his mother Mary who is recorded in the London census of 1841 as employing a man and a boy. Lucraft lived with his mother at Mill Row, off Kingsland Road, as he raised his family and began to make a reputation as a draughtsman and carver. In the 1850s Lucraft’s wife Mary died aged about 52. On 27 June 1858 Lucraft married again at the Register Office in the Strand. He married Mary Ann Adelaide Hitchin, spinster daughter of William and Mary Hitchin. She was living at 5 Lyons Inn and she said her father was a jeweller. Chairmaker Lucraft became one of the most famous chair-carvers of his generation and stayed at this trade until well past retiring age, turning out chairs which were admired at many exhibitions. His son, George Seely Lucraft, set up the company G S Lucraft and Co Ltd. on City Road in London and employed his father as a chair-carver. This arrangement gave Lucraft the freedom to follow his political career. George Seely Lucraft followed his father in the furniture trade and was also active in radical politics, among other things being the chairman of the committee to promote the Labour candidate for the London School Board in succession to his father in 1890. George later was active in Liberal-Labour politics, being the agent for a London borough. The company designed and sold a range of furniture and supplied the well-known retailers such as Maples, Robert Gillow and Heals (department store). It was not the English custom to always sign work and so it is not possible to find many identifiable examples of his work. On one occasion Queen Victoria attended an exhibition and admired one of his chairs, commenting to him in person about their excellence. There is one domestic chair known to have been made by him in the possession of a descendant. A chair was made by Lucraft at the request of the Liberal Party (UK) when they wished to honour William Ewart Gladstone. It was presented to Gladstone by the liberals of the Borough of Greenwich and the Liberal Club of the neighbourhood on 17 August 1881. After some years research the chair was found again in a corner of the library at Hawarden Castle (18th century): the North Wales home of Gladstone. One of Lucraft's great great grandsons, Jack Edmonds Lucraft, arranged for it to be restored as it was in a very bedraggled condition. The irony is that the cabinet-maker made a chair for the Prime Minister who gave working men the vote after a time when the cabinet-maker had himself been called in parliament a \\"cabinet-breaker\\". Temperance Lucraft's obituary in the Hackney Gazette records him as a total abstainer from alcohol after 1846. Abstinence, Teetotalism or Temperance, was a religious and political movement in the 19th century as working men and women organised into support groups and movements to promote abstinence and to support each other after they had \\"taken the pledge\\". George Howell, the political activist and commentator, remembered that he worked closely with Lucraft in temperance work in 1856 and 1857. The members of local temperance groups formed themselves into Circuits, along the lines of Methodism, and speakers travelled from one group to another speaking and promoting the issues. Soon after becoming a teetotaler in 1846 Lucraft also signed the declaration of the London Temperance Charter Association. This declared that the signatories would not drink any intoxicating drinks until the People's Charter, the foundation tenets of Chartism, became the law of the land. From the late 1840s to the late 1850s the Temperance Movement seems to have been one of Lucraft's main political activities and he is reported in 1858 as being the treasurer of the London Temperance Charter Association. He is also noted at a meeting he arranged of this group on Sunday 10 January in the Star Coffee House at 33 Polden Lane, Barbican, and he is noted as also arranging the meeting for the next week. After his election to the London School Board in 1870 Lucraft was one of the working men selected to meet Lord Kimberley to express their support for the government's proposed legislation on the sale of alcohol which was then being debated. The next flurry of reported temperance actions comes when Lucraft is standing for election to parliament for the constituency of Tower Hamlets in 1879. He and his agents, including Mr Dyer, are drumming up support for Lucraft, and the temperance movement is one network they lobby hard to gain votes. Much of the evidence for this is recorded in the National League Journal, which is the publication of Josephine Butler's movement for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. In April 1879 he is reported as being the President of a \\"flourishing\\" branch of the Band of Hope Union in London. In one letter to the electors he says: > ..with respect to the important question of temperance, and the licensing > laws, I would support the placing of a legal power of restraining the issue > or renewal of licences, in the hands of the inhabitants themselves, by some > efficient measure of local option. One report of his election platform in 1879 says that he stands \\"as a temperance, repeal, and working men's candidate.\\" In March 1880 the Friends Association Report (the Quakers) reports that Lucraft was well supported among non-conformist and temperance voters. Then towards the end of his life he was still active in the movement. In 1896 he was at a well-reported and famous meeting of Octogenarian Teetotallers in St Martin's Hall, London. There were over forty 80-year-olds present and around 200 had actually been traced with 152 providing questionnaire answers about their lifestyle. A few months later in November 1896 Lucraft celebrated 50 years as a total abstainer, at a party where he was surrounded by his children, grandchildren and great grand children. This significant achievement in his life was reported in the Hackney Gazette. At his funeral just under a year later in 1897 the minister reported that as well as from every other walk of his life, there were representatives of the temperance movement at his grave-side. Lucraft's report on the Paris Universal Exhibition Lucraft's prowess with the chisel, and his campaigning for the improvement of the education of apprentices, led him to be asked by the Royal Society of Arts to attend the Paris Universal Exhibition Exposition Universelle (1878), and report on his findings in respect of the training of workers in the furniture trade. He found matters far better arranged in France for the production of quality furniture and proposed wholesale changes to the apprentice system, many of which were later adopted. He was anxious that draughtsmanship should be a part of the training, as he himself always drew out his own work, and felt men were disadvantaged in their skills if they could not do the whole piece as a craftsman. He proposed the idea of a school or college for the furniture trade apprentices and this idea eventually became the London School of Furniture, now part of London Metrolitan University. He proposed and worked towards the establishment of a museum in East London of craft work, skills and tools that would enable the working man to see how trades were worked in other times and places. A copy of the report sits in the bookcase which was presented to him on his re-election to the London School Board in 1873. The inscription on the bookcase reads: > This bookcase and books were presented to Mr Benjamin Lucraft, the only > workman member of the first School Board for London, on his re-election in > 1873, by his Committee and Supporters, as a mark of their esteem, and in > recognition of services rendered by him to the cause of popular education. Working men’s exhibitions Lucraft worked with others to bring into being the working men's exhibitions he sought, perhaps as a counterbalance to the grandeur and exclusivity of the Great Exhibition which he had witnessed. The First Working Men's Exhibition in the Agricultural Hall was in 1865 and George Howell records that Benjamin was one of the promoters. Benjamin was on the Management Committee for the first exhibition where he donated £10 and exhibited some furniture – perhaps a chair of his or some work from the company. At the second he was on the Council of the Exhibition which secured substantial contributions. Political life Lucraft had taken an interest in political reform which would benefit the situation of the working classes. Through the middle years of the 19th century there were myriad organisations which campaigned across a whole range of issues. Lucraft was active in a large number of these organisations, often taking office in them and representing their interests, both in London and abroad. During these years it is often possible from newspaper records to say where he was speaking at or chairing meetings on three, four or five evenings a month and probably more besides those reported in the press. One document says Lucraft joined Attwood's Political Union in 1829, before he came to London. Lucraft became the secretary and most prominent member of the North London Political Union, a Chartist group which met in Islington and which George Howell attended. He was a speaker on the circuit of the Wheatsheaf Yard Temperance Society organised, by Howell on the Wesleyan model, which lectured all over London. Dyer also records Lucraft's active membership, from 1850, of Richard Cobden's Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association. In the spring of 1848 Feargus O'Connor decided on a new strategy that would combine several different tactics: a large public meeting, a procession and the presentation of a petition to the House of Commons. O'Connor organised the meeting to take place at Kennington Common on Monday, 10 April 1848. Lucraft was reported to have been at the great demonstration, which was the strongest meeting of supporters of the Chartist Movement. Lucraft ended his life close to James Bronterre O'Brien, the leader of the Chartists, as they are both buried in Abney Park Cemetery north of Kingsland Road where Benjamin spent his working life. George Howell wrote a handwritten note about Lucraft's life and activities which survived in the papers of the Bishopsgate Institute and is re-produced here: > \\"Mr Lucraft may be described as almost the last surviving link between the > old Chartist movements prior to 1850, and the newer political movements > which grew out of the Chartist agitation towards the end of the fifties and > onward until the Reform Act of 1884. Lucraft was one of the earliest I heard > speak after coming to London, Mr Ernest Jones being the first as already > stated. Often and often have I stood by Lucraft in what was then known as > the Copenhagen Fields, and also in a meeting place in Chapel Street > Islington. I became more closely associated with Mr Lucraft in Temperance > work in 1856 and 1857, from which dates we have been old friends and close > associates. He was among the first members of the Reform League and was a > member of the Council and the Executive from the first. He was never a very > effective speaker, but he was able always to put his points forcibly, > because he knew what he wanted and could see tolerably clearly the way in > which it could be obtained. In his earlier days he was thought to be an > implacable Chartist, and nothing else; but he was not the man to oppose > reform because all that he desired was not granted. Lucraft was sternly > devoted to \\"principles\\", but he acknowledged the value of compromise when it > was a question of something or nothing.

The outcome was the formation of the Political Reform League (or Union) with a programme of: *manhood suffrage *the ballot *triennial parliaments *equal electoral districts *abolish property qualifications The league was active throughout 1859 and its work encouraged the establishment of Manhood Suffrage Associations throughout the country, of which the North London Union was one. Lucraft came to prominence in London working-class politics with former Chartists like himself – Robert Hartwell and J.B. Leno among them – he was an important bridge figure between the radical movements of the Chartist period and the Reform League of the eighteen sixties. One political commentator says that \\"as much as anyone in these early years of the revival of the political reform movement, Benjamin helped to impress upon the craft unions the recognition of the desirability of political initiatives and change\\". His attitude was summarised in a letter he wrote to Reynold's Newspaper on 28 July 1861 about a prolonged strike of builders: \\"I should hope that the operative builders are by this time convinced that political power has something to do with the social conditions of the people.\\" Lucraft joined the Land and Labour League as the most advanced radical organisation in England and served on the Council. He was a founder member of John Stuart Mill's Land Tenure Reform Association, urging the state control of land and served on the General Council of the Association. The International Working Men's Association Lucraft was at the inaugural meeting of what became the First International, the International Workingmen's Association, described by Karl Marx in a famous letter to Friedrich Engels dated 4 November 1864. The founding meeting took place on 28 September in St. Martin's Hall. It had been convened by George Odger and William Randal Cremer, and the meeting was chaired by Edward Spencer Beesly. Lucraft was elected to the provisional committee. Lucraft was a member of the General Council of the IWMA from its foundation in 1864 to 1871 and he played an active and committed part in its political work. He was a signatory to the 'Address to the People of America' on 29 November 1864 congratulating them on Abraham Lincoln's re-election to the presidency. He proposed a resolution on 10 January 1865 pledging continued support to the Polish people in the struggle against Tsarism, was a delegate to the Brussels Congress of 1868 and the Basle Congress of 1869. Marx drafted most of the important documents and statements from the International. His career to that point, as an author and journalist, made him a natural in this service. The only other \\"intellectual\\" worker on the General Council (known early on as the Central Council) was Peter Fox (another journalist). The other members were: *Tailor–Johann Eccarius, Lessner, Maurice, Milner, Stainsby *Carpenter–Applegarth, Cremer, Lochner, Weston *Weaver—Bradnick, J. Hales, Mottershead *Shoemaker—Morgan, George Odger, Serraillier *Furniture Maker—Dell, Lucraft *Watchmaker—Jung *Mason—Howell *Musical-instrument maker Dupont *Hairdresser—Lassassie The minutes of the meetings show Lucraft as often chairing the First International and at one such meeting in 1869 a letter of the IWMA was approved to be sent to the National Labour Union of the United States. Lucraft preferred Marx's use of the word \\"vermin\\" to describe those who profited from the American Civil War. In September 1866 Lucraft was a representative of the London Trades Council at the First Conference of the International in Geneva. Parliamentary reform The reform of voting rights for Parliamentary elections had long been an issue. An Act of Parliament in 1809 made the purchase of votes illegal and was one of a series of Parliamentary Acts which dealt with minor abuses of the electoral process during the first part of the 19th century. The Great Reform Act of 1832 had made some steps to change the way Parliament was elected with the old system of rotten boroughs with just a handful of voters, literally less than 10 people in some cases, was swept away. The underlying problem of the representation of the people, by which was meant a wider franchise than just the county set or the propertied land-owners, was not addressed. By the 1860s Lucraft was active as a representative of the Furniture Workers and as such sat on the General Council of the International Working Men's Association, The First International. The years in which Lucraft was involved in the agitation for the extension of the franchise into the later sixties was the most influential period of his career. At this stage he ranked as an ultra-radical in terms of British politics. He understood the crucial importance of the craft unions in any viable working-class political movement and accepted a need for militant action to achieve defined aims and goals. After Garibaldi's visit to London the English members of the General Council, including Lucraft, had taken a prominent part in the founding of the Reform League in 1865 which led to the agitation culminating in the Reform Act 1867. Lucraft was a member of the Council and the Executive of the Reform League. The Trades Unions had been unenthusiastic about political, as opposed to industrial, reform and after the failure of the mildly reformist Liberal bill of 1866 the Reform League was in danger of going under. Lucraft was the key figure in deliberately soliciting the participation of the Trades Unions and in breaking down their reservations, paving the way for the demonstrations of 1866–1867. The modest programme that Edward Beales and George Howell, leaders of the League, were promoting began to be challenged by Lucraft in April 1866 when he started weekly outdoor meetings on Monday nights on Clerkenwell Green – thereby reached out to working-class groups hitherto unresponsive to more traditional political agitation. They had a wagon for a platform, a band to lead the singing, and a banner for the men from Clerkenwell. Once Lucraft had taken the initiative the executive felt obliged to vote to subsidise the Clerkenwell Green events. William Ewart Gladstone's inability to carry through even a minimal reform and the reactionary and insulting speeches of the anti- reformers all combined to lead the Reform League down a more militant path. The first manifestation of the new temperament among the League membership came, not unexpectedly, from Lucraft. His response to the defeat of the Liberal bill was to escalate his open air demonstrations by moving them from Clerkenwell Green to Trafalgar Square. Early in 1867 the militant elements in the leadership of the Reform League again decided that more vigorous action was required, this time against the Derby-Disraeli ministry, and weekly demonstrations began in Trafalgar Square. Charles Bradlaugh and Lucraft were among those pushing for escalation and Lucraft was one of five proponents appointed to organise a rally in Hyde Park on 6 May. This was first banned by the Home Secretary Spencer Walpole and then, because of the very large numbers that gathered round the ten platforms, allowed to proceed in spite of thousands of police and troops. On the evening of 27 June 1866 he led a thousand demonstrators to the West End where an estimated 10,000 had already assembled. Unwilling to allow Lucraft to outface them the Executive decided to hold its own Trafalgar Square meeting on 2 July and Howell was appointed to supervise the arrangements. This was the League's first real popular success, with estimates up to 80,000 for the attendance, and it was further decided to hold a rally in Hyde Park on 23 July. The authorities became frightened by the spectre of revolution and Sir Richard Mayne, Metropolitan Police Commissioner, banned the meeting although a majority of the Executive resolved to ignore the prohibition. Unlike July 1866 the League showed its capacity for organising a working-class agitation in defiance of parliamentary authority while keeping good order despite some small local violence. The workers forced their way through the police cordons, past flailing truncheons, to a noisy rally where a short section of the park railings were pushed over. The League regarded the sixth of May as a 'great moral triumph'. The Home Secretary resigned, on what were said to be health grounds, and the Prime Minister admitted that the government had 'subjected themselves to some slight humiliation in the public mind'. While Benjamin Disraeli denied he was yielding to pressure he accepted the lodger franchise proposals, removed the distinction between personal and compound ratepayers, allowed it to be a household suffrage measure and stripped most of the guarantees which the Conservatives had been promised. Fenianism Lucraft took an active part in the debates on the much more sensitive issue of Fenianism during the latter part of 1867 within the Council of the Reform League. Beales, the President, had written a letter approving the aims of the Fenians, but condemning their tactics, and for this he was strongly attacked by those members of the League's Council who were also members of the General Council of the IWMA: notably Lucraft, Odger and Weston. Lucraft argued that the Irish \\"were fully justified in using physical force to redress their wrongs\\" and he tried to prevent the letter being published. The British Press vigorously condemned the Reform League in general and Lucraft and Odger in particular. Basle Congress 1869 At the Basle Congress of the First International in 1869 Lucraft not only advocated land nationalisation (along with Robert Applegarth) but he further argued for the large-scale cultivation of the land by the state on behalf of the people, as against peasant proprietorship. He explained that as he had travelled by train through France he saw the fragmentation of the land into tiny plots that had followed the French Revolution; a fragmentation which made profitability for the people so difficult. He recommended that land should be owned by the state on behalf of the people so that the French problems with fragmentation should not be repeated in England. Rather, large farms operated by the state with the full consent and labour of the people should be developed. The proposals sound uncannily like the later soviet collectives and would surely have suffered the same consequences had they been implemented. These opinions, when reported in the British press, were described as \\"scandalous\\". Resignation from the IWMA In 1871 Lucraft resigned from the IWMA after vacillating on the question of the Paris Commune. It was a radical touchstone and the IWMA press reports led to a pressure on its members. After a dispute about his signature being on the document written by Marx for the Council 'The Civil War in France', when it was clear he had had the chance to remove it if he chose to do so, Lucraft resigned admitting he had formed his views on the article from the press reports. After his resignation, with Odger, Lucraft made no more publicly recorded references to his association with the IWMA, or the part he had played in its history. Education for all After the passing of the 1867 Reform Act the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Robert Lowe, remarked that the government would now \\"have to educate our masters\\". As a result of this view the government passed the 1870 Education Act. The act was drafted by William Edward Forster and stated: *The country would be divided into about 2500 school districts. *School Boards were to be elected by ratepayers in each district. *The School Boards were to examine the provision of elementary education in their district, provided then by Voluntary Societies, and if there were not enough school places they could build and maintain schools out of the rates. *The school Boards could make their own by-laws which would allow them to charge fees or, if they wanted, to let children in free. Boards provided an education for the five to ten age group. In some areas school boards pioneered new educational ideas. For example the London School Board introduced separate classrooms for each age group, a central hall for whole- school activities and specialist rooms for practical activities. In Bradford Fred Jowett and Margaret McMillan pioneered the idea of free school meals for working-class children and, in Brighton, Catherine Ricketts developed the idea of increasing attendance rates by hiring women to visit mothers in their homes to explain the benefits of education. The 1870 Education Act allowed women to vote for the School Boards and women were also granted the right to be candidates to serve on the School Boards. Several feminists saw this as an opportunity to show they were capable of public administration. In 1870 four women, Flora Stevenson, Lydia Becker, Emily Davies and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson were elected to local School Boards. Elizabeth Garrett, a popular local doctor, obtained more votes in Marylebone than any other candidate in the country. On 1 December 1870 Lucraft was the only one of nine working men's candidates to be elected to the London School Board and he continued to be elected every three years until he retired in 1890, at which date he was the longest serving member. London Democrats held a celebration for Lucraft's election on 2 January 1871 at the Hole in the Wall in Hatton Garden with \\"feasting, speech-making, and other joyous observances\\". Lucraft was never an outstanding figure on the board, but he pursued useful aims of a moderately radical kind. He opposed the office of paid chairman, opposed the use of the cane, always argued for free education, was vigorous against military drill in Board schools and was chairman of the committee which investigated and reported on the historical misappropriation of charitable funds and establishments – originally intended for the education of the children of the poor, but which had been taken over for the children of the wealthy. Dulwich College was one of a number of examples Lucraft quoted when the \\"City Parochial Charities\\" report came out in 1879. He was early in demanding compulsory education for all and the removal of all fees. Peace and other issues In 1872 Lucraft was part of a deputation of working men to Lord Kimberley on 1 June, in favour of the Government Licensing Bill. In 1873 his grateful constituents presented Ben with a bookcase and 105 books of relevant titles, in appreciation for his work on behalf of the 'working man'. In 1874 Lucraft was added to the Council of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union as a sixth working man's representative. The Peace Congress was held in Paris in September 1878, peace between France and Germany being the issue, with the political involvement of Russia and England on the agenda. Lucraft represented the Workmen's Peace Association in Paris of which he was one of the first members, and for nine years its chairman. He went to other foreign conferences on their behalf. Contagious diseases More unorthodox was Lucraft's support, from 1877 onwards, for the Working Men's National League for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. He spoke nearly every week for four years and became one of the honorary secretaries of the organisation, working very closely with Josephine Butler. He went with her and others to Liege in 1879 and they brought pressure on the Liberal Party to include Repeal of the Contagious diseases Acts in the Liberal manifesto. He described the Contagious diseases Acts as 'the very worst class of party legislation' saying to working men who mostly were too embarrassed to discuss sexually transmitted diseases that \\"It is YOUR sisters, YOUR daughters that these acts are to entrap – to make use of. Not only for the army, not only for the common soldiers, but for the 'officers and gentlemen'\\". Standing for Parliament Lucraft was asked by activists to stand again for Parliament in 1880, this time in Tower Hamlets, whereas in 1874 he had stood in Finsbury. He failed on both occasions though his position and candidature put him amongst the first Liberal-Labour and pre-Labour men. Death Lucraft died at his home at 18 Green Lanes at Newington Green on 25 September 1897 leaving an estate of £334. The funeral took place in Abney Park Cemetery and was conducted by Rev J. Ellis of Barnsbury Chapel who gave a full address of the life and achievements of a man who \\"while working for the generations through which he lived had brought benefits that future generations would enjoy.\\" There were a large number of relatives, friends and former colleagues present – including a representative from Broadclyst in Devon. Natural flowers were placed on the coffin and Mr Ellis quoted the \\"Psalm of Life\\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: > The lives of all great men remind us, We should make our lives sublime, And > departing leave behind us, Footprints on the sands of time.

Protection includes soft armor coupled with hard ballistic inserts. Cargo retention capabilities include various pouches and pockets attached via standard PALS webbing. The entire FSBE kit includes the vest body, a throat protector, a groin protector and an assortment of load bearing pouches. A fully loaded vest with armor plates can prove quite heavy, and is typically used only in high-risk direct action (DA) missions. The Combat Integrated Releasable Armor System (CIRAS) suite of equipment manufactured by Eagle Industries is currently the new FSBE II system, and has replaced the FSBE AAVs. Prior to this, the FSBE series replaced the older Close Quarters Battle Equipment Assault Vest (CQBE AV) that had been used by Force Recon since 1996. This kit is available to civilians, with prices for the FSBE vest body starting at US$500. This price does not include any ancillary pouches or soft armor or hard ballistic armor inserts. This vest was unique in its quick release system, allowing the Marine to ditch the entire vest very quickly in case of emergency. This quick release feature, also used with newer modular plate carriers such as the Paraclete Releasable Assault Vest, was developed in response to a 9 December 1999 CH-46E Sea Knight helicopter crash over the Pacific. Several members of 5th Platoon, 1st Force Reconnaissance Company drowned because they could not eject their heavy armor in time to swim away. Only one Marine was able to successfully ditch his equipment and survive.

It was developed by Eclipse Design and published by Electronic Zoo in 1991, although it was originally published by Electronic Zoo. The game features a spaceship as it flies through various levels of varying graphic styles. Each level has a boss at the end, and each level is separated by a sub-level of avoiding asteroids while the next level loads from the floppy disk. Cardiaxx was developed by David Mariner and Jon Mitchell of Eclipse Design, with Joe Karthouser later joining them. The game's original publisher, Electronic Zoo, failed to release funds owed to Eclipse Design for its development shortly after its public release in 1991. As a result, the Atari ST version was never released, and legal action followed. However, Electronic Zoo closed down during the legal proceedings. The game was later released by Team17, but again no funds beyond the initial signing fee were ever released. Therefore, Mariner and Mitchell still retain all rights to Cardiaxx to this day.

Internet media, namely dedicated websites and Internet forums, are in fact platforms that enable the broadcast of request and action plans concerning human flesh search and that allow the sharing of online and offline search results. Human flesh search has two eminent characteristics. First, it involves strong offline elements including information acquisition through offline channels and other types of offline activism. Second, it always relies on voluntary crowd sourcing: Web users gather together to share information, conduct investigations, and perform other actions concerning people or events of common interest. Human flesh search engine is similar to the concept of \\"doxing\\", a practice often associated with the social activist group Anonymous. Both human flesh search engine and doxing have generally been stigmatized as being for the purpose of identifying and exposing individuals to public humiliation, sometimes out of vigilantism, nationalist or patriotic sentiments, or to break the Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China. More recent analyses, however, have shown that it is also used for a number of other reasons, including exposing government corruption, identifying hit and run drivers, and exposing scientific fraud, as well as for more \\"entertainment\\"-related items such as identifying people seen in pictures. A categorization of hundreds of Human flesh search (HFS) episodes can be found in the 2010 IEEE Computer Society paper A Study of the Human Flesh Search Engine: Crowd-Powered Expansion of Online Knowledge. The system is based on massive human collaboration. The name refers both to the use of knowledge contributed by human beings through social networking, and to the fact that the searches are usually dedicated to finding the identity of a human being who has committed some sort of offense or social breach online. People conducting such research are commonly referred to collectively as \\"Human Flesh Search Engines\\". Because of the convenient and efficient nature of information sharing in cyberspace, the Human Flesh Search is often used to acquire information usually difficult or impossible to find by other conventional means (such as a library or web search engines). Such information, once available, can be rapidly distributed to hundreds of websites, making it an extremely powerful mass medium. The purposes of human flesh search vary from providing technical/professional Q&A; support, to revealing private/classified information about specific individuals or organizations (therefore breaching the internet confidentiality and anonymity). Because personal knowledge or unofficial (sometimes illegal) access are frequently depended upon to acquire this information, the reliability and accuracy of such searches often vary.  Etymology  The term originated on the Mop forums in 2001, coined by Mop to describe \\"a search that was human-powered rather than computer-driven\\". The original human flesh search engine was a subforum on Mop similar to a question-and-answer (Q&A;) site, focusing on entertainment-related questions. Gradually, the definition of the term evolved from not just a search by humans, but also a search of humans.  History  An early human flesh search dated back to March 2006, when netizens on Tianya Club collaborated to identify an Internet celebrity named \\"Poison\\" (). The man was found out to be a high-level government official. However, Fei-Yue Wang et al. state that the earliest HFS search was in 2001, \\"when a user posted a photo of a young woman on a Chinese online forum..., and claimed she was his girlfriend.\\" She was eventually identified as a minor celebrity and the initial claim was discredited. Over the years, the human flesh search was repeatedly deployed, sometimes fueling moral crusades against socially unacceptable behaviors, such as political corruption, extramarital affairs, animal cruelties or perceived betrayal/hostilities towards the Chinese nation. Individuals on the receiving end often have their real-life identities or private information made public, and can be subjected to harassment such as hate mails/calls, death threats, graffiti and social humiliation. Organizations can be subjected to coordinated cyber-attacks. The human flesh search engine has also been deployed for amusement. Johan Lagerkvist, author of After the Internet, Before Democracy: Competing Norms in Chinese Media and Society, said that the Little Fatty meme, in which pictures of a teenager were photoshopped on film posters without the boy's permission, demonstrated that the human flesh search engine \\"can also be directed against society's subaltern and the powerless\\" and that \\"[t]his raises important issues of the legitimate right to privacy, defamation, and slander.\\"Lagerkvist, p. 60-61. The Baojia system of community rule-of-law in ancient China bears strong similarities with human flesh search. Both are based on some form of vigilantism.  Stance of the People's Republic of China  In December 2008, The People's Court in Beijing called it an alarming phenomenon because of its implications in \\"cyberviolence\\" and violations of privacy law. On the one hand, human flesh search by netizens is a manifestation of freedom of speech. It is also the supervisory right given by Article 41 of the Chinese Constitution. On the other hand, human flesh search leads to the disclosure of ordinary people's names, identities, family addresses and other personal data. The Chinese government has an official stance on it – human flesh search engines violate privacy laws. Some local governments have made human flesh search engines illegal by stating that posting the private information of another will result in a fine of 5000RMB. But all in all, the Chinese government does little to punish such cases; some might even say the government encourages it by allowing such widespread behavior to go unchecked. In film and television *Caught in the Web is a 2012 film by Chen Kaige which explores fictional instances of use of the human flesh search engine. *In the television series Mr. Robot, the mysterious group known as The Dark Army has elements based on the phenomenon. *Season 20 episode 6 of Law and Order was titled \\"Human Flesh Search Engine\\". * A web- based platform designed to pool the knowledge efforts of Internet sleuths is the premise of the CBS program Wisdom of the Crowd. * Searching is a 2018 American thriller film about human flesh search. * The Snow White Murder Case presents a tragedy of human flesh search. * The 2009 Chinese film Invisible Killer is related to human flesh search. * Human Flesh Search Engine is a Chinese documentary released on 18 July 2009.  Notable examples  *South China Tiger photograph claims: In 2007, a hunter in Shaanxi Province, China, claimed to have encountered a live wild South China Tiger, which has long been considered extinct in natural environments. The photos he had taken were later published in a Science magazine (“Rare-Tiger Photo Flap Makes Fur Fly in China”). The wide circulation of these photos triggered a wave of authentication among Web users. who leveraged expertise in diverse domains ranging from zoology, botany, to photography and geometry. Finally, a participant successfully identified the origin of the images: a calendar cover painting, from which the hunter had used to forge the claimed South China Tiger pictures. Human flesh search ended up proving that the photos were fake and the 'exciting' discovery was a scam. *Zhang Ya's Earthquake Video: In May 2008, an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 swept through Sichuan, China, killing approximately 87,587 people. In response to the quake, a video insulting the victims was published on YouTube by an anonymous female user. After nationwide outrage, The Human Flesh Search Engine identified the girl as Zhang Ya, doxing her and uploading her personal information online. *Li Gang incident: On October 16, 2010, a drunk-driving student hit a pair of university students while driving inside Hebei University, with one fatality, and was reported to have shouted “Sue me if you dare, my dad is Li Gang!” when apprehended. Following the spread of the news on Chinese internet forums, the driver's identity was revealed as Li Qiming, the son of the deputy director of the local public security bureau. *Doxed driver in the west of China: On 21 March 2013, a driver in Ürümqi, China rolled down his window to spit on an elderly homeless person lying on the street. Witnesses recorded the first few digits of the license plate. A brief broadcast by a local radio quickly caused a stir on the Internet and the furious netizens doxxed Yin Feng, a part-time taxi driver in Ürümqi, only several hours later with harassing calls and blackmails.

Compared to younger magazines, it was known for its stability, genuine quality and as somewhat culturally conservative. History and profile Artes was started in 1975 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts and the Swedish Academy. Official representative was Horace Engdahl, as permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy. Östen Sjöstrand was the editor. He opened it for advanced essays and held popular essay competitions. He did not avoid the esoteric and the magazine became of favourite of culturally interested readers. Sjöstrand also became a member of the Swedish Academy in 1975. According to critic Curt Bladh, this gave him insight into the discussions preceding the Nobel Prize in Literature and several prize winners were previously featured in Artes. Samfundet De Nio joined the magazine soon after its start. In 1989 Bengt Jangfeldt and Gunnar Harding took over the magazine and turned it into more of \\"an educational institution\\" according to Horace Engdahl. Anna Brodow and Jan Arnald took over as editors in 2001 and tried to increase the subscriptions and renew the content with more contemporary material. Anna Brodow commented that many of the magazines traditional readers were becoming too old for such heavy material. She also said that it was difficult to cover art, music and literature at the same time. The magazine produced about 600 pages per year in its four issues. The circulation was about 1500 copies at the end. There was also an English-language periodical, Artes International. Artes was financed by subscriptions and subsidies. The academies of music and arts stood for 90,000 Swedish krona each per year, while Swedish Academy contributed the main part with 600,000 per year (about 55,000 EUR, US$76,000). In April 2005 it was announced that the magazine would be closed at the end of the year. Then Artes was closed down in 2005 for economic reasons. The circulation of the magazine was 1,500 before its demise. It cost too much and had too few readers according to Beate Sydhoff, permanent secretary of the Academy of Arts. It had lost its government funding a few years earlier because the owners were deemed too economically strong to get subsidies.

He was better known as \\"Kralle\\".  Life  Krawinkel's father was a sailor in his hometown of Wilhelmshaven, Lower Saxony. Krawinkel's music career started in the mid-1960s in nearby Bremerhaven, where he played the guitar in a band called \\"The Vampyr\\". He then teamed up with vocalist Stephan Remmler in a Rolling Stones-influenced band called MacBeats (later renamed Just Us). The band was successful in Northern Germany, during its existence, Just Us played a two-week engagement at Star-Club in Hamburg. In 1969, Just Us disbanded, and Krawinkel started a new band called Cravinkel with some of its former members, including Remmler. Cravinkel's folk and progressive rock influences did not break them into the mainstream, despite the release of two studio albums. In 1972, after only three years, Cravinkel disbanded. Krawinkel subsequently got a teaching job, but still played guitar in several bands, including the Emsland Hillbillies and George Meyer & Company. In 1979, he teamed up with his former bandmate Stephan Remmler in an attempt to get back into the commercial music business. After intensive rehearsals, they formed the band Trio with drummer Peter Behrens. In early 1980 they went on to become one of the best known bands of German new wave. While Remmler contributed most of the lyrics, Krawinkel came up with the music for about half of the songs. When Trio was on a creative break in 1984, he collaborated with Marius Müller- Westernhagen, playing lead guitar in his band. He was featured on his album \\"Die Sonne so rot\\" (The sun so red) and went on his \\"Westernhagen\\" album tour in Germany. In 1986, Trio broke up for good. In 1989 Krawinkel moved from Großenkneten to Berlin. In 1993, he worked with a friend Wilfried Szyslo who was a musician, on a solo album called Kralle. Krawinkel had written the lyrics for the album entirely in English, but allowed another friend Rio Reiser to translate them into German. He sang a duet with Nena on the single 'N Zentimeter Liebe. In 1998 Krawinkel got an entry in the Guinness Book of Records by riding the longest distance from Seville to Hamburg by horse. Krawinkel later operated a private music studio in his adopted home near Seville, and also maintained a home in Berlin. He was largely withdrawn from the public. His widow is television producer Monika Kölling, with whom he had a son. They met in 1985 during the shooting of the Trio feature film Drei gegen Drei (Three Against Three). Kölling was responsible for handling the extras.  Death  Krawinkel was a heavy smoker and was diagnosed with lung cancer in late 2013. He died in Cuxhaven on 16 February 2014 at the age of 66 years, and was buried at sea.

He was one of the first factory-backed motorcycle racers of the early 20th Century. He rode for Indian and then Excelsior, and was the fastest rider in the United States in the early 1900s.Jacob DeRosier at The Motorcycle Hall of Fame  Early years  Jake DeRosier was born in Quebec, Canada in 1880 and came to the United States at the age of four. DeRosier started his career in bicycle racing as a teenager. French auto racing driver Henri Fournier introduced DeRosier to motorcycles in 1898 while visiting the United States. Motorcycles like Fournier's were used to pace bicycle racers, drafting them in order to attain higher speeds. After acquiring skills with the motorbike, DeRosier was among the first to enter the new sport of motorcycle racing in 1901. DeRosier earned a strong reputation as a daring rider not only by winning races, but bouncing back from numerous injuries. His diminutive physique, once described as, \\"a slight, slender fellow that a strong Christmas breath might blow over,\\" was actually an advantage. His light weight helped the primitive, low power motors of the time achieve greater speed.  Factory rider for Indian  After winning top rider honors at the Federation of American Motorcyclists national championship in 1908 at Patterson, New Jersey, he attracted the attention of the Indian Company.Jacob DeRosier at Indian Motorcycles.com He was signed to a contract and began racing every week, amassing hundreds of victories over time. Like the bicycles, the motorcycles raced on wooden velodromes, quarter to half mile saucer shaped board track speedways. This was dangerous as riders would crashed into the boards, breaking bones and driving splinters deep under their skin. DeRosier's reputation grew and by the time he entered the first motorized competition at the new Indianapolis Motor Speedway for their August 1909 Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM) meet, newspapers called him \\"world champion.\\" An injury on the Speedway's unpaved gravel surface nearly proved deadly. Severely injured in a match race with a top California rider named Ed Lingenfelder, DeRosier hemorrhaged for a week. Against doctors's advice, DeRosier entered a Lowell, New Jersey race just a few weeks later on September 10, 1909. In 1910 he set the FAM speed record at 79.6 mph. On February 7, 1911 he ran 90 consecutive miles to claim every FAM speed record from 1 to 100 miles. In June 1911 DeRosier tackled the 1911 Isle of Man TT race. While he set fast time in practice, he crashed out of competition after leading early.Charles Collier at iomtt.com Redeeming himself, he defeated English Champion Charles Collier at the famous Brooklands oval speedway in a match race just a few days later. At the Brooklands (England) races of July 8 he was recorded at 87 mph (The MotorCycle July 13, 1911). At Brooklands on August 5, 1911 he broke the outright speed record (held by Henri Cissac since July 1905) when he covered a flying kilo in 25.2 seconds equal to 88.77 mph. He was riding his well known 7 hp Indian racer \\"No 21\\". (The MotorCycle August 10, 1911).  Move to Excelsior  After DeRosier returned from England in 1911, he had an argument with company founder George Hendee and was fired from Indian. He was immediately hired by Excelsior Motorcycles. He then set a kilometer speed record for Excelsior at 94 mph.  Injuries and death  While Jake DeRosier was widely respected for his skills at the wheel of a motorcycle, he spent much of his career injured in spectacular accidents. He broke his left leg three times, his left forearm once, had one rib removed, fractured his skull, severed an artery and suffered serious leg burns from flaming engines. He suffered the most serious injuries of his career on March 12, 1912. Injuries to his left leg and thigh were extensive. He endured three corrective surgeries, losing his life to complications from the final operation on February 25, 1913.

On September 20, 2004, the President signed an Executive Order to terminate the national emergency with respect to Libya and to end IEEPA- based economic sanctions on Libya. On September 30, 2006, the Act was renamed the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA). The Act was originally limited to five years, and has been extended several times. On December 1, 2016, ISA was extended for a further ten years. The Act empowers the President to waive sanctions on a case-by-case basis, which is subject to renewal every six months. As at March 2008, ISA sanctions had not been enforced against any non-US company. Despite the restrictions on American investment in Iran, FIPPA provisions apply to all foreign investors, and many Iranian expatriates based in the US continue to make substantial investments in Iran. Background In 1995, in response to the Iranian nuclear program and Iranian support for Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestine Islamic Jihad, that are considered terrorist organizations by the US, President Bill Clinton had issued several executive orders with respect to Iran, including Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, banning U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995, which banned U.S. trade with and investment in Iran. Provisions The Act targets both U.S. and non-U.S. business making certain investments in Iran. Under ISA, unless exempted by the president, all foreign companies that provide investments over $20 million for the development of petroleum resources in Iran will be imposed two out of seven possible sanctions, by the U.S.:Wright, Steven. The United States and Persian Gulf Security: The Foundations of the War on Terror, Ithaca Press, 2007 * denial of Export- Import Bank of the United States assistance * denial of export licenses for exports to the violating company * prohibition on loans or credits from U.S. financial institutions of over $10 million in any 12-month period * prohibition on designation as a primary dealer for U.S. government debt instruments * prohibition on serving as an agent of the United States or as a repository for U.S. government funds * denial of U.S. government procurement opportunities (consistent with World Trade Organization obligations), and * a ban on all or some imports of the violating company. Renewal and expiration ILSA included a five-year sunset clause and was to expire on August 5, 2001. In the debate in the U.S. Congress on whether ILSA should expire, some legislators argued sanctions hindered bilateral relations, and others argued they would be seen as a concession on an effective program. ILSA was renewed by the Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. ILSA was renewed for another five years,Public Law 107-24 until August 2006. In 2005, the Iran Freedom Support bill was introduced in both houses to extend the provisions of ILSA indefinitely and to impose a time limit for the administration to determine whether an investment violates ILSA. The House of Representatives legislation, H.R. 282 was introduced on January 6, 2005, was reported by committee on March 15, 2006, and passed the House on April 26, 2006, by a vote of 397–21, with 14 not voting. The companion Senate legislation, S. 333 was introduced on February 9, 2005 was referred to the Foreign Relations Committee. The bill was not reported by the committee and died. On July 25, 2006, bill H.R. 5877, to extend ILSA until September 29, 2006, was introduced in the House, and passed the next day by voice vote. It was passed by the Senate by unanimous consent on July 31, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on August 4, 2006. On September 30, 2006, ILSA was renamed the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), as it no longer applied to Libya, and extended until December 31, 2011. The Iran Freedom and Support Act passed later that year. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 amended the Iran Sanctions Act to expand the president's ability to punish companies aiding Iran's petroleum sector.

Hayley Turner's success has seen an enormous increase in the number of female apprentice jockeys riding in the UK in the second decade of the 21st century. She became the first woman to ride 100 UK Flat race winners during a calendar year, when winning on 'Mullitovermaurice' at Wolverhampton on 30 December 2008. In that year Turner rode in over 900 races in the UK - one of only five riders to achieve the milestone that year. On 31 August 2015 Turner announced that she would retire from riding at the end of the season. She came out of retirement in 2018. In between she was a regular contributor to ITV racing. Racing career Turner was born two miles from Nottingham Racecourse in north Nottinghamshire, daughter of Kate and Richard Turner. Her first ride in public was on Markellis at Southwell on 27 March 2000. Turner never finished the race; the horse broke a leg and died. Her first winning ride was her eighth, on Generate at Pontefract on 4 June 2000. She rode her first Group winner on Lady Deauville in the Lando-Trophy in Germany on 16 November 2008. Initially, she rode out for Mark Polglase at Southwell and then attended the Northern Racing College. Early support came from trainers such as Jeff King, but she is best known for her ongoing and successful association with Newmarket based Derby winning trainer Michael Bell, with whom she was apprenticed in 2005 when winning the Champion Apprentice title. She was joint Champion Apprentice with Saleem Golam with 44 winners in 2005. She rode her 95th winner in September of that year, thereby \\"riding out her claim\\", only the fourth woman to do so since Alex Greaves in 1991. Bell sent her to Tom Amoss, in New Orleans for three months of training. She also spent the winter of 2004 riding out for Godolphin in Dubai. High-profile handicap wins in 2008 on Furnace at Chester and Ascot raised Turner into the higher echelons of the weighing room, as did wins on The Betchworth Kid. She was voted as Channel 4's Racing Personality for 2008. In March 2009, Turner was badly injured in an accident putting a horse through starting stalls on the Newmarket gallops, which initially threatened to sideline her for the rest of the year. She made some guest appearances as a pundit on Channel 4 Racing during this time. However, when fresh medical evidence allowed her to return to race-riding in mid-summer she was instantly back to riding successfully. Turner ended the year on 60 winners, her second highest figure despite missing much of the season. The 2010 flat racing year continued to be successful for Turner; highlights included a first Group 1 ride on Barshiba in the Nassau Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, and winning the Group 2 Lancashire Oaks on the same horse at Haydock a month earlier; and a successful partnership with classy two-year-old Margot Did, which included two winners and second places in two Group 3s and a Group 2. In January 2011, Turner had her first race-rides at the Meydan racecourse in Dubai, as part of the annual Dubai Racing Carnival. In July 2011 Turner rode her first Group 1 winner, Dream Ahead, in the July Cup at Newmarket, and repeated the trick the following month winning the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes on Margot Did during York racecourse's Ebor Meeting. 2012 saw Turner ride 92 winners, her second-best season, at a strike rate of 12%, also a career second-best. She ended the year early to have surgery on an ankle. On 31 May 2012 she became the first female jockey in history to ride on the Dubai World Cup night. She rode Margot Did in the Al Quoz Sprint where she finished well back in the field. On 2 June 2012 she became the second female jockey in history to ride in the Epsom Derby. She rode Cavaliero where she came last of the nine horses running. Most significantly in 2012, Turner won the Beverly D. Stakes in America, becoming the first UK-based girl to ride an international Grade One winner. At the end of the 2015 season Turner retired but raced at some invitation events. Suspension In 2017 Hayley Turner was suspended for three months after she breached BHA rules when she bet on races after she reapplied for her racing licence. Return from suspension In 2018 Turner came out of retirement after her suspension. Turner rode in France due to the female jockey weight allowance. Honours Turner was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to horse racing. Personal life Turner, like many UK Flat jockeys is based in Newmarket, Suffolk. In 2011, she became a member of the Jaguar Academy of Sport and received the 'Most Inspirational Sportswoman' Award at the 2011 Jaguar Academy of Sport Annual Awards. Turner was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours. In 2020, Turner became a racing brand ambassador.

The park, which covers , was a nature reserve until 1923. It is considered one of the most beautiful gardens in Europe, and in 2005 the park was awarded Notable Garden status. On 9 November 1994 the park was classified as a Historic Monument. In 1999 a winter storm heavily damaged the park's forests. As of late 2008, restoration efforts were still underway. The park is operated as a domaine national under the French Ministry of Culture. History The park is located on the site of the Château de Saint-Cloud, a residence of royal and imperial families from the 16th century. After Napoleon III declared war on the Prussians, the site was occupied by a Prussian force which used the high outcropping to shell Paris. Counter-fire from the French caused the building to burn on 13 October 1870. The structure was completely razed in August 1892. Only a few outbuildings remain from the original structure.

Only one species has been named, Jibeinia luanhera. It is known from one holotype fossil found in the Hebei province, People's Republic of China. This fossil is now lost.Zhang, Fucheng., Ericson, Per G.P., Zhou, Zhonghe. (2004) \\"Description of a new enantiornithine bird from the Early Cretaceous of Hebei, northern China\\" Canadian Journal of Earth Science 41: 1097 - 1107 The holotype was, however, described and figured in detail by Hou (1997). In the summer of 1993, the holotype was presented to engineer Li Pai of the Hebei Provincial Office of Geology by a local farmer. Li, along with Hou Linhai and Zhou Zhonghe, investigated the quarry from which it came, at the locality of the Dongtuyao brick factory, Northern Hebei Province, Linjituxiang Village. They determined that it was collected from the Yixian Formation. However, later research into the geology of the area showed that it actually came from similarly-aged beds of the Huajiying Formation.Jin, F., Zhang, F.C., Li, Z.H., Zhang, J.Y., Li, C. and Zhou, Z.H. (2008). \\"On the horizon of Protopteryx and the early vertebrate fossil assemblages of the Jehol Biota.\\" Chinese Science Bulletin, 53(18): 2820-2827. J. luanhera was described from a nearly complete fossil. The fossil seems not to have ever received a catalogue number, nor to have been accessioned by a museum.Hou, Lianhai (1997) \\"Mesozoic Birds of China\\" Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing, China. Published by the Phoenix Valley Provincial Aviary of Taiwan. In Chinese, translated by Will Downs, Bilby Research Center, Northern Arizona University, January, 2001. Possible synonyms Zhang et al. described a new enantiornithean named Vescornis in 2004. They noted that it was nearly exactly the same size as Jibeinia, and collected from the same locality. They noted several morphological similarities to Jibeinia, but that it also differed in some characters from the written description. They sought to compare the two specimens but learned from Dr. Hou in 2001 that the holotype Jibeinia had been lost, and existing casts were of too poor a quality to be decisive. Thus they conclude that it will be impossible to rule out the possibility that the two are the same species, and that Vescornis is a junior synonym, unless the holotype of Jibeinia is rediscovered. Etymology The genus name comes from a Latinized form of the Jíbei region and the character Jí, which refers to one of the nine geographical divisions of ancient China. The specific name is after the Luanhe River.

The garden was established in 1906 by Marie-Louise Cognac-Jaÿ, a native of Samoëns and founder of La Samaritaine department store in Paris, to designs by Louis-Jules Allemand. It opened in 1909. Since 1936 it has been directed by the Scientific Division of Botany from the National Museum of Natural History. The garden now contains about 8,000 plants from around the world, representing some 4,500 types of alpine flowers (including the rare Iris perrieri,) and 500 varieties of trees and shrubs. It is established at an altitude of 700–800 meters above sea level on a steep, south-facing limestone slope overlooking the old village, with garden features that include ruins of the Tornalta castle (12th century), a chapel (1687), and fountains and cascades. The Maison de la Jaÿsinia is at the garden's entrance, with a reception area providing information about the garden and the history of its founder.

It takes its title from a song by Georges Brassens. Agnès Jaoui said in an interview that one day she was on her way to a writing session with Jean-Pierre and had in her ears the song 'L'orage' by Georges Brassens which opens with the lines 'parlez-moi de la pluie, et non pas du beau temps.' Plot The film is a comedy of middle-class French life ' examining culture clashes, puncturing smugness, exposing fault lines, finding strength in romantic and familial relationships and discovering an underlying sadness that stops some way short of tragedy.'The Observer, 9 November 2008 The film is set in a small town in Provence during a rainy August. Following the death of her widowed mother Agathe Villanova comes from Paris to deal with the sale of the home where she and her younger sister Florence were brought up, and to announce her entry into politics. She is the author of a feminist best-seller and a divorced film-maker Michel wants to make a TV documentary about her. Michel is having an affair with Agathe's sister. His collaborator is a young Algerian hotel clerk Karim, whose elderly mother has worked for most of her life as a servant with the Villanova family. Agathe's prejudice is put under the microscope when she records a series of interviews with Karim. 'The characters weave around each other for a week or so, occasionally colliding...everyone comes to have a better knowledge of themselves..the dialogue rings true..the ensemble acting is perfect..The film compares favourably with the best of Éric Rohmer.'

It was in service for about 100 years in a Geneva pump station, where energy in the form of pressurized water was produced for the local industry. Over pressure in the network was released through the world-famous Jet d'Eau. In total, 17 such turbines were operating in the pump station.The explanation table, attached to the Jonval turbine in Schiffbau, Giessereistrasse 5, 8005, Zurich, Switzerland The Jonval turbine is a water turbine design invented in France in 1837 and introduced to the United States around 1850 and were widely used. The Jonval turbine is a \\"mixed-flow\\" turbine design. Mixed-flow designs were well suited for the low-head applications common in the eastern United States. The smaller size, higher speed, higher power, lower cost, and ability to operate efficiently with variable water levels caused these and other types of hyrdaulic turbines to replace the vertical waterwheel as the primary source of power in American industries. The Jonval turbine is a horizontal waterwheel. The water descends through fixed curved guide vanes which direct the flow sideways onto curved vanes on the runner.Jonval Water Turbine. English heritage thesaurus . It is named after Feu Jonval, who invented it. The Jonval incorporated ideas from European mathematicians and engineers, including the use of curved blades.Huge Gears, Silent 94 Years, Get New Duties: Telling the Tale of How Humans Affect Nature This new turbine failed to satisfy the public interest in seeing the water wheels in action, which was likely accepted as a minor drawback at that time. This type is efficient at full gate, but at partial gate some Francis turbine designs are more efficient. The usual orientation of the wheel was horizontal and the first devices were even alternatively named as \\"horizontal water wheels\\". However, some sources mention turbines with both vertical and horizontal shafts. N.F. Burnham, an American turbine manufacturer, patented numerous improved designs in the second half of 19th century. His turbines had greater efficiency than the Jonval, especially at partial gate, and fewer maintenance problems.

Unusually for a bus route entirely in Greater London, it is tendered and subsidised by Islington London Borough Council rather than Transport for London, and is operated under a London Service permit. For this reason, buses used on this route are in a yellow livery, rather than the usual red, and it does not charge standard London fares. Oyster Cards are not accepted anywhere on the route (other than freedom passes). It is currently operated by HCT Group. Despite the name, the route is not part of the Plusbus scheme. History The 812 was introduced by CT Plus in 2007. Together with similar route 816, it replaced a group of routes which previously ran under the Plus Bus name.HCT group - PlusBus Funding for the route was withdrawn at the end of 2007, leading to fears of cancellation, but local councillors stepped in to fund the route. The route now carries 27,000 passengers per year.Canonbury Liberal Democrats - Lib Dems keep the PlusBus on the road The route was increased in frequency from two buses per hour to three in 2009.

The system, composed of the interconnected Whigpistle, Martin Ridge, and Jackpot Caves, has been mapped to over , and is currently the United States' thirteenth-longest cave. Discovery The original entrance to the system, Whigpistle Cave, was discovered by Rick Schwartz in 1976.Taylor 1979 Mapping was initiated by the National Park Service under the supervision of park hydrologist Jim Quinlan in an effort to better understand the hydrology of Mammoth Cave's watershed.Groves 1998 Significance Surveyed so far to over , the Martin Ridge Cave System is ranked as third- longest in Kentucky, 11th-longest in the United States, and 47th-longest in the world. The cave also contains what is likely the largest cave chamber in Kentucky, the Big Womb. The Big Womb measures long, wide, and high. The cave possesses an intimate hydrologic connection with nearby Mammoth Cave. Groundwater dye tracing has shown that water flowing from Mammoth Cave's Hawkins River emerges downstream at a river within Martin Ridge Cave. The unexplored section between Mammoth Cave and the Martin Ridge Cave System is underwater and will require cave diving to determine whether a traversable physical connection is possible. Connections In 1994, explorers from the James Cave Project discovered Jackpot Cave to the east of the Whigpistle entrance. Their efforts mapped over three miles (5 km) of new cave.Glennon 2001 In 1996, Western Kentucky University graduate students Alan Glennon and Jon Jasper discovered a new entrance and eight miles (12.5 km) of cave passage. Their exploration revealed connections to Jackpot in June 1996 and Whigpistle in August 1996. Current exploration Efforts continue to explore and map the cave. The Martin Ridge Cave System is separated from Mammoth Cave by a deep valley, though a human connection may be possible at the caves' lowest elevation passageways. Currently, at least a one-kilometer (3,300-foot) gap exists between the two caves' closest known reaches. See also * List of caves in the United States FootnotesReferences * Glennon, J.A.

It produced six named tropical cyclones. The season officially started on June 1, 1992, and finished on November 30; however, Subtropical Storm One formed outside the official timeline on April 21. Subtropical Storm One was the first recorded subtropical cyclone to form in April since the recording of subtropical cyclones began in 1968. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations during the season. During the year, three tropical depressions, one subtropical storm, two tropical storms, and four hurricanes formed. It produced seven storms, less than the average of ten usually formed throughout an Atlantic hurricane season, while four of the storms went on to become hurricanes. The first cyclone to form inside the official season was Tropical Depression One, which formed on June 25. Of the four hurricanes, Hurricane Andrew was the most intense, reaching Category 5 status. In late June, Tropical Depression One caused severe flooding in southwestern Florida and Cuba; heavy rainfall was recorded in Pinar del Río, Matanzas, and Havana. When Andrew struck Florida and Louisiana in August, it became the second- costliest hurricane to hit the United States. Damages were estimated to be about $26.5 billion and 68 people were killed. Tropical Storm Danielle made landfall at the Delmarva Peninsula on the Virginian coast on September 25, causing minimal flooding. There was one recorded death recorded due to Danielle; a ship east of New Jersey was sunk due to rough seas. The season finished on October 30 when Hurricane Frances became an extratropical gale before dissipating.

When initiated in 1983, the goal of the project was to create a two-seat light aircraft that could be sold for less than $US 20,000. Additionally, it was hoped that the Sunbird operating costs would be half that of a conventional two-seat aircraft.\\"De Vore aims for spin-proof Sunbird\\" 1986, p. 18 Funding for the project became available in 1985, and the Verilite subsidiary was created to develop the concept. The design was unconventional: a high-wing, strut-braced monoplane with the single engine fitted in pusher configuration at the rear of the wing, and the empennage carried on an aluminum boom. The pilot and a single passenger sat side by side in a fully enclosed cockpit, and fixed, tricycle undercarriage was fitted. Originally simply dubbed the \\"Affordable Airplane\\", the name \\"Sundancer\\" was chosen as the winner of a public competition, and later changed to \\"Sunbird\\". Verilite worked together with NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center to correct a serious flaw in the design when tests with a radio-controlled model saw the aircraft enter a spin following a stall.Chambers 2003, p. 147 Adding droops to the outboard halves of the leading edges eliminated the problem and rendered the Sunbird \\"unspinnable\\". The first flight was originally anticipated in May 1986 and type certification by mid 1987.\\"De Vore Sunbird advances\\" 1985, p. 44 However, taxiing trials did not commence until February 1987 and the first attempt to fly the aircraft, on 18 April, resulted in a crash immediately after take-off. The NTSB report on the accident noted that the aircraft was unable to maintain altitude after leaving ground effect, and that although the engine was rated at 60 hp, it could only deliver 40 hp.NTSB 1987 The aircraft was rebuilt, in the process losing 150 lb (68 kg) of structural weight, and the engine was modified to deliver 70 hp.\\"Second Sunbird flies\\" 1987, p. 15 In this form, the Sunbird flew successfully on 5 October 1987. The projected cost of the aircraft had increased to $22,000 by 1985 and to $24,000 by 1987. Certification was now expected by mid-1989. Financing the project had proved difficult, however, with Gilbert De Vore personally contributing 75% of the $1 million spent on the project by the end of 1986.\\"De Vore Sunbird approaches first flight\\" 1986, p. 22 De Vore had plans to make a public offering to raise between $1 million and $25 million to fund the rest of the development and certification program, and would need further finance to establish production. In the event, however, development was cancelled, and no further Sunbirds were built.

He became a mayor of Amsterdam and a powerful Amsterdam regent after the death of his older brother Cornelis de Graeff. Like him and their father Jacob Dircksz de Graeff he opposed the house of Orange. In the mid-17th century he controlled the finances and politics.Andries Bickers Biography at the DBNL (dutch) Andries de Graeff followed in his father's and brother's footsteps and, between 1657 and 1672, was appointed mayor some seven times. De Graeff was a member of a family of regents who belonged to the republican political movement also referred to as the ‘state oriented’, as opposed to the Royalists. Andries was called the last regent and mayor from the dynastie of the \\"Graven\\", who was powerful and able enough to ruled the city of Amsterdam. De Graeff was a Free Imperial Knight of the Holy Roman Empire,Nederlands adelsboek 1914, p 15 an Ambachtsheer (Lord of the manor) from Urk en Emmeloord, during the late 1650s chiefcouncillor of the Admiralty of Amsterdam,Andries de Graeffs Biography at digitale bibliothek voor de nederlandse letteren, part II (dutch) chieflandholder of the Watergraafsmeer and dijkgraaf van Nieuwer-Amstel. Together with his brother Cornelis De Graeff he became an illustrious Patron and Art collector. Family De Graeff Andries de Graeff was born in Amsterdam, the third son of Jacob Dircksz de Graeff and Aaltje Boelens Loen. His older sister Agneta who married Jan Bicker, was the mother of Johan de Witts wife Wendela Bicker. After he has been finished his study in Poitiers he was married to his niece Elisabeth Bicker van Swieten, daughter of the Amsterdam Mayor Cornelis Bicker van Swieten. Both his brother Cornelis and Andries were very critical of the Orange family’s influence. Together with the Republican political leader Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt, the De Graeff brothers strived for the abolition of stadtholdership. They desired the full sovereignty of the individual regions in a form in which the Republic of the United Seven Netherlands was not ruled by a single person. Instead of a sovereign (or stadtholder) the political and military power was lodged with the States General and with the regents of the cities in Holland. During the two decades the De Graeff family had a leading role in the Amsterdam administration, the city was at the peak of its political power. This period was also referred to by Republicans as the ‘Ware Vrijheid’ (True Freedom). It was the First Stadtholderless Period which lasted from 1650 to 1672. During these twenty years, the regents from Holland and in particular those of Amsterdam, controlled the republic. The city was flush with self-confidence and liked to compare itself to the famous Republic of Rome. Even without a stadtholder, things seemed to be going well for the Republic and its regents both politically and economically. Political career Andries de Graeff was from 1646 a member of the vroedschap and from 1657-71 mayor seven times in the difficult times of the First Stadtholderless Period. Between 1650 and 1657 he was advisor of finances and finance minister of Holland at Den Haag. Like his brother Cornelis, their cousin Andries Bicker and Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen De Graeff became one of the main figures behind the building of a new city hall on the Dam, which was inaugurated in 1655. In 1650 he started his career as advisor in the ministerium of finances in Den Haag. After he became a minister he went back to Amsterdam, and took place as a sort of chairing mayor of this city. After the death of his brother Cornelis, De Graeff became the strong leader of the republicans. He held this position until the rampjaar. He also became an advisor of the Admiralty of Amsterdam and in 1661 he was made an advisor of the States of Holland and West Friesland. Andries de Graeff in 1639, painted by Rembrandt van Rijn =The Dutch Gift= In 1660 the Dutch Gift was organized by the regents, especially Andries and his brother Cornelis. The sculptures for the gift were selected by the pre-eminent sculptor in the Netherlands, Artus Quellinus, and Gerrit van Uylenburgh, the son of Rembrandt's dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh, advised the States-General on the purchase. The Dutch Gift was a collection of 28 mostly Italian Renaissance paintings and 12 classical sculptures, along with a yacht, the Mary, and furniture, which was presented to King Charles II of England by the States-General of the Netherlands in 1660.Whittaker and Clayton: pp. 31-2 for the art, Gleissner for the furniture and yacht. The yacht was the gift of the Dutch East India Company, according to Liverpool Museums (with model) , or the City of Amsterdam according to other sources. Most of the paintings and all the Roman sculptures were from the Reynst collection, the most important seventeenth-century Dutch collection of paintings of the Italian sixteenth century, formed in Venice by Jan Reynst (1601-1646) and extended by his brother, Gerrit Reynst (1599-1658). The collection was given to Charles II to mark his return to power in the English Restoration, before which Charles had spent many years in exile in the Dutch Republic during the rule of the English Commonwealth. It was intended to strengthen diplomatic relations between England and the Republic, but only a few years after the gift the two nations would be at war again in the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665–67. =Perpetual Edict (1667) and the Rampjaar 1672= Palace op de Dam - Seat of the Amsterdam Regent, by Gerrit Berckheyde In 1667 De Graeff was one of the \\"sponsors\\" (the other signers where De Witt, Gillis Valckenier and Gaspar Fagel) of the Perpetual Edict, that was a resolution of the States of Holland in which they abolished the office of Stadtholder in the province of Holland. At approximately the same time a majority of provinces in the States-General of the Netherlands agreed to declare the office of stadtholder (in any of the provinces) incompatible with the office of Captain general of the Dutch Republic. The Republic was in a dangerous position and war with France and England seemed imminent. The call for the return of a strong military leader from the Orange family was gaining momentum, particularly among commoners. A number of Amsterdam regents had started to realise that they needed to seek rapprochement with the Orangists. This put increasing pressure on Grand Pensionary Johan de Witts position. In 1670, the Amsterdamse Vroedschap (Amsterdam City Council) led by Mayors Valckenier and Coenraad van Beuningen decided to enter into an alliance with the Orangists and to offer the young prince William III of Orange a seat on the Council of State. This caused a definitive split between De Witt and the Orangist Amsterdam Group of regents around Mayor Valckenier. However, De Witt managed to push the turncoats into the Amsterdam city administration and they were sidelined during the vroedschap elections of February 1671. Andries de Graeff was once again put forward as mayor and managed to gain control with his Republican faction. During the winter of 1671 it seemed as if – at least in Amsterdam – the Republicans were winning. It was an exceptionally opportune moment to commission a monumental ceiling painting on Amsterdam’s independent position for the ‘Sael’ of his mayor’s residence. De Graeff had a clear message in mind for the ceiling painting: the ‘Ware Vrijheid’ of the Republic was only protected by the Republican regents of Amsterdam. The paintings by Gerard de Lairesse glorify the de Graeff family’s role as the protector of the Republican state, defender of ‘Freedom’. The work of art can be viewed as a visual statement opposing the return of House of Orange. In 1672, when the Orangists took power again, de Graeff lost his position as one of the key States party figure together with his nephews Pieter and Jacob de Graeff and his brother-in-law Lambert Reynst. In that year, De Graeff was also attacked by the Amsterdam mob crowd at the Haarlemmerpoort.Andries de Graeffs Biography at digitale bibliothek voor de nederlandse letteren, part VII (dutch) Andries de Graeffs City Palace in the Gouden Bocht, Herengracht 446 Coat of Arms as knights of the Holy Roman Empire Coat of arms family De Graeff  Marriage and children  He was married to Elisabeth Bicker van Swieten, and the couple had four children: * Cornelis de Graeff (1650–1678) m.

It is a herbaceous perennial growing to tall and wide, with leaves divided into 9 leaflets, and bowl-shaped deep pink or deep red flowers, in diameter, in late spring (May in the Northern Hemisphere). Paeonia officinalis was first used for medicinal purposes, then grown as an ornamental. Many selections are now used in horticulture, though the typical species is uncommon. Paeonia officinalis is still found wild in Europe. The cultivar 'Rubra Plena' (deep crimson double flowered) has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Founded in 1969 as \\"Cuggi\\" in Toorak, Australia, the label was renamed in 1987. In addition to clothing, the company's 1992 international trademark filing registered the brand for cosmetics and toiletries, leather goods, furniture, textiles, and toys. History Founded in 1969 as \\"Cuggi\\" in Toorak, Melbourne, Australia, the label was renamed in 1987 to sound more like an indigenous Australian name. The label was purchased in 2002 by Coogi Partners LLC, a joint venture in New York City; the brand subsequently grew from its core sweater line to a full apparel line, featuring patterns and designs reflective of the signature sweaters. The line expanded to women and children, including T-shirts, jeans, dress shirts, dresses, sweatshirts and matching sweat pants, footwear, handbags, outerwear, bathing suits, and underwear. Relaunch Coogi relaunched in 2014 with a focus on the authentic sweater for men, introducing new products and color treatments. According to The New York Times, the label is experiencing a resurgence. Fashion brands such as Rag & Bone, Pigalle, Burton and Supreme have been paying homage to Coogi. In popular culture The brand is first mentioned by The Notorious B.I.G. in the song \\"One More Chance / Stay With Me (Remix)\\". \\"Heart throb never, black and ugly as ever, however, I stay Coogi down to the socks, rings and watch filled with rocks\\". The rapper also mentions the brand in the 1996 song \\"Hypnotize\\" in which he raps: \\"Every cutie wit a booty bought a Coogi\\". Kicking off a new trend and causing clothing articles to fly off the shelves with consumers rushing to make a purchase. The brand is then mentioned in the lyrics of the 2005 Kanye West song \\"Gone,\\" in which he raps: \\"You sweat her and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi,\\" as well as in his 2010 song \\"Devil in a New Dress,\\" where Rick Ross raps: \\"Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice- roller.\\" Kanye West also goes on to mention the brand in his lyrics of the 2017 song \\"Feel Me\\" with G.O.O.D Music counterpart Tyga: \\"Coogi, Coogi, Coogi, Coogi on, feels like I'm in the movie holmes, texted my consigliere, tell the maid leave the jacuzzi on.\\" The brand is mentioned in the lyrics of the Hilltop Hoods song \\"Cosby Sweater,\\" in which MC Suffa raps: \\"When I'm dressed like Theo's Dad, In a Coogi listening to Kool G Rap.\\" The song makes reference to Biggie Smalls who was famously photographed wearing a Coogi sweater. The Australian musician explained in an August 2014 interview that he owns a collection of Coogi sweaters. The brand is mentioned in the lyrics of the 2013 ASAP Ferg song \\"Work (Remix)\\" in which he raps: \\"Coogi down to the socks, like I'm Biggie Poppa\\", in reference to The Notorious B.I.G. being known for wearing Coogi.

The type species of Eoconfuciusornis, Eoconfuciusornis zhengi, was named and described by Zhang Fucheng, Zhou Zhonghe and Michael Benton in 2008. The generic name combines a Greek ἠώς, eos, \\"dawn\\", with the name of the related genus Confuciusornis. The specific name honours Zheng Guangmei. The holotype, specimen IVPP V11977, was found near Sichakou in Fengning in Hebei province. Its provenance the Sichakou Beds are part of the Dabeigou Formation which was seen by the describers as dating to the Hauterivian, and were thought to be about 131 million years old. The specimen consists of a compressed skeleton that is relatively complete and shows well conserved remains of most of the feathering. Eoconfuciusornis was somewhat smaller than Confuciusornis, but otherwise very similar with a pointed toothless beak. Compared to the latter it had longer legs and lacked a pierced deltopectoral crest on the humerus. Eoconfuciusornis was assigned to the Confuciusornithidae. It would have been the most basal species known of that group, as reflected by the generic name and in conformation to the age ascribed to it, about six million years older than the specimens of Confuciusornis.

It was in operation between 1170 and 1555 and was located in Slangerup, Denmark. There are no visible remains of the former Slangerup abbe..  History  Slangerup was a royal residence dating from perhaps as early as 1000. It was part residence, part farm, and enclosed so it could serve as a small fort. About 1095 King Erik Ejegod, who was born here, replaced the wooden stave church with a limestone church dedicated to Saint Nicholas. Its final dimensions were 60 meters long and 13 meters wide. The church was later enlarged to comprise a nave with two side aisles and an apse added onto the choir. It also had twin towers about 30 meters in height. In 1170 King Valdemar den Store gave the farm and church of Slangerup to a community of Benedictine nuns, to establish ab abbey. status indicated by, e.g., Esrum klosters brevbog, Bent Christensen, p. 124, Museum Tusculanum Press, 2002, , , online at google.books.co.uk It was dedicated to Our Lady and Saint Nicholas at the suggestion of Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde. Valdemar moved his unmarried daughters to the abbey where they could be watched over and educated. The church became one wing of the cloister, in which the nuns were separated from the world. They had their own private entry to the choir of the church which was gated off from the rest of the congregation, who usually attended the church only on holy days. In 1187 a letter was written to Bishop Absalon, complaining that not all the nuns were \\"virtuous\\". This complaint led to the replacement of the Benedictine nuns with the new and strict Cistercian Order, which was seen as a reform. The original nuns either left or conformed to the new observance. Throughout the 13th-14th centuries, the abbey received many rental properties and gifts of money from noble families for services rendered by the nuns for recently departed family members or for burial inside the Church. They also received donations and allowances from families who sent unmarried women to live a quasi-religious life in the abbey until they married or took the vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. By 1344, Princess Agnes Birgersdotter, the daughter of King Birger Magnusson and Queen Märta of Denmark , and her retinue were sent to live at Slangerup by King Erik VII. To ensure the abbey's continued existence it was given the town of Slangerup and several other large properties. =Dissolution= The Protestant Reformation in Denmark brought an end to the abbey at Slangerup. In 1529 the estate was given to Martin Bussert, who lost it during the Count's Feud. All religious houses were closed and became Crown property in 1536 when Denmark accepted the Smalcald Articles and officially became a Lutheran realm. Monasteries including Slangerup Abbey were secularized, with the nuns allowed to live in the former monasteries under the supervision of a secular prioress. Nobles were given the use and income of the estate with the condition that they assume responsibility for the remaining nuns. At Slangerup this arrangement lasted until 1555 when Arild Ubbe was given the estate by King Christian III. In 1559 the valuable estate and its rent properties were broken up and divided between Copenhagen Castle, the University of Copenhagen, and the town of Slangerup. St. Nicholas' church was adjudged superfluous and demolished in 1572; the materials were used to construct St. Michael's Church (Slangerup kirke Skt. Mikaels) in Slangerup. Part of the altarpiece at St. Michael's includes the wooden altarpiece from Slangerup Abbey Church. By 1600 the entire monastic complex was completely demolished. The building materials were sold to Frederik II to be used in the construction of Frederiksborg Castle at Hillerød.

Ida is made up of 16 civil parishes containing 191 townlands, it is one of 12 baronies in the County. The barony is in size, with highest point at Tory Hill. The chief town is Slieveroe. The N25 crosses the barony. Ida lies at the south-east of the county, with the barony of Gowran to the north (whose chief town is Gowran), Iverk and Knocktopher to the west (whose chief towns are Piltown and Knocktopher), and the barony of Kilculliheen to the south. County Waterford is located to the east of the barony.  Etymology  The earliest reference to \\"Ida\\" as the barony was is 1587 where it was described as the barony of \\"Igrinn and Ida\\". The name Ida is derived the name of the ancient sept, \\"Ui Deaghaigh\\" now O'Dea in English. It has had many spellings including \\"Odawe Odaw\\", \\"Odaygh\\", \\"Hidaa\\", \\"Oda\\", \\"Odda\\", \\"Idagh\\", \\"Idea\\", and by 1839, the \\"Barony of Ida\\". Ida was recorded in the Down Survey (1656) as \\"Ida Igrin Ibercon\\" and on Griffith's Valuation (1864) as \\"Ida\\".  History  The area was in the south-east of the ancient kingdom of Osraige (Ossory), referred to as \\"Comor na tri uisge\\", \\"the district of the three waters\\", possibly referring to the area where the rivers Barrow and Suir meet. Before the arrival of the Normans the three Osraige tribal lands were Ida, Igrinn and Iberchon. The Ossorian clans included \\"Ua nDeaghaidh\\" (O'Dea) of \\"Uí Dheaghaidh\\" (Ida), \\"Ua Braonáin\\" (O'Brennan) of \\"Uí Duach\\" (Idough), and \\"Ua Caollaidhe\\" (O'Kealy, O'Coely, Quealy) of \\"Uí Bercháin\\" (Ibercon). Previously known as the barony of Iberchon, and in ancient taxation it was known as the Deanery of Obargon or O'Bercon. The early Anglo-Norman records of \\"Overk in Ossory\\" included the present day baronies of Iverk and Ida, and the southern extremity of the barony of Knocktopher. This was probably was the same area as \\"Desceart Osraige\\" (\\"South Osraige\\"). In the early 1170's Richard de Clare (Strongbow) granted the cantred, or barony, of Overk (Iverk) to Milo fitz David (or fitz Bishop), (the son of David FitzGerald, Archdeacon of Cardigan and Bishop of St David's). Milo's descendants were barons of Overk for nearly the next 150 years. In the 18th century the county contained the baronies of Ida, Igrin, and Ibercon. By the 19th century these were restructured into the barony of Ida. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed under \\"Administrative units\\".Irish Statute Book, Statutory Instruments: 2003 Nos 520, 521, 522, 523, 525; 2004 No 872; 2005 No 847  Geography  Map of County Kilkenny.

Description A55 links many of the main arterial routes within the city as well as creating a bypass of the often congested city centre and problematic A12 Westlink. Large sections of the route in east Belfast have been upgraded to dual carriageway standard with at-grade traffic light controlled junctions, together with off-road cycle paths alongside. However many sections (e.g. through Knock and from the Shaw's Bridge (Belvoir) to the M1) remain single carriageway, with four lanes of traffic. (Though the section through Knock has a proposed upgrade going through the final designs stages as of January 2009.) Despite this, all of the route in the west and north of the city (with the notable exception of the Monagh Bypass near Andersonstown) is nothing more than a single carriageway two-lane road based on local city streets and arterial routes. = Crossing The Lagan = The A55 crosses the River Lagan at Lagan Valley Regional Park, where the Malone Road becomes the Milltown Road. The single-span, 70m-long arched concrete bridge runs parallel to the more historic Shaw's Bridge, which it replaced in 1977. Proposed upgrades The lack of investment directed towards an upgrade for these sections of the city's ring road can be explained by a lack of demand, relatively lower traffic levels and few industrial sites in comparison to those of the south and east. However, in an attempt to attract inwards investment into the area the West Belfast & Greater Shankill Task Force has laid out a plan (publicised in late 2008) which proposes to extend and improve the route; extending from the Monagh Bypass as far north as the A52 Crumlin Road in the northwest of the city.

John White (1575 – 21 July 1648) was the rector of a parish in Dorchester, Dorset, England. He was instrumental in obtaining charters for the New England Company, and the Massachusetts Bay Company. He took a close personal interest in the settlement of New England. Life He was son of John White, yeoman, and his wife Isabel, daughter of John Bawle of Lichfield. He was born in the manor house at Stanton St. John, Oxfordshire, where his father held a lease from New College, Oxford, and was baptized there on 6 January 1575. His elder brother, Josias, was rector of Hornchurch, Essex, 1614–23, and father of James White, a merchant of Boston, Massachusetts. In 1587 he entered Winchester School, and then was elected a fellow of New College in 1595. He graduated B.A. on 12 April 1597 and M.A. on 16 January 1601. He was appointed rector of Holy Trinity, Dorchester, in 1606, and for the rest of his life was identified with that place. He was a moderate conforming Puritan, concerned with reforming his parish. John married Ann Burges, daughter of John Burges of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. They had three known children: John; Samuel (who married first Sarah Cuttance, daughter of shipmaster Edward Cuttance); and Josiah, who married first Mary Hallett. Massachusetts Bay Company White himself never sailed to America. About 1623 he interested himself in sending out a colony of Dorset men to settle in Massachusetts, allowing nonconformists to enjoy liberty of conscience. The attempt by the Dorchester Company to plant a colony at Cape Ann with Thomas Gardner as Overseer, at what would become Gloucester, Massachusetts, did not prove at first successful; in the previous decade, only about 500 English colonists had established a foothold, and this Company was wound up by 1625. White then recruited emigrants from the western counties of Dorset, Somerset and Devon, who set sail a few years later as a better-supported expedition and organized church aboard the ship Mary and John.Revd. John White White made many trips to London from Dorchester, working to obtain a patent in 1628 for lands between the parallel lines south of the Charles River to north of the Merrimack River. He obtained the sponsorship of London merchants for a new colony in the New World. Concerned about conflicting claims to land given to several companies active in the north-east of the New World, the New England Company sought and was granted a Royal Charter on 4 March 1629, becoming the Massachusetts Bay Company. The Massachusetts Company had Richard Saltonstall as a chief shareholder. White was a member of the company, and on 30 Nov. he was nominated one of the committee to value the joint stock. John Endecott was sent out as governor. Francis Higginson and Samuel Skelton were chosen and approved by White as ministers, and sailed for the Dorchester colony on 4 May 1629 aboard the George Bonaventura. The charter enabled John Winthrop to hire a fleet of what would eventually comprise eleven ships, later called the Winthrop Fleet, to bring a new wave of emigrants across the Atlantic. John Winthrop sailed in the \\"Arbella\\", White holding a service on board before she sailed. The Mary and John was the first, carrying 140 people recruited by White. In June 1630 they landed and founded the settlement of Dorchester, Massachusetts. The eleven ships eventually transported about 700 colonists to the New World,. Second publication of the original text of John Winthrop's journal. In 1632 and 1636 White was corresponding with John Winthrop (who urged White to visit the colony) about cod-lines and hooks to be sent, as well as flax of a suitable growth for Rhode Island. From 1630 to 1640 ships carried about 10,000 English colonist to the New World in what has been called the Great Migration. Later in the 1630s White was under suspicion for his financial dealings. About 1635 or 1636 White was examined before Sir John Lambe about some papers seized in his study, and relating to a considerable sum of money sent by White to Dr. John Stoughton. This eventually turned out to be in part a legacy from one Philippa Pitt, bequeathed to White for good causes, and in part disbursements for the colonists in New England. White produced particulars of these in his note-books, and after six months' attendance before the court of high commission, he was discharged and the informant against him reprimanded. Westminster Assembly When the First English Civil War broke out in 1642, Dorchester declared itself on the side of Parliament. A party of Prince Rupert's horse burst into White's house, plundered it, and carried off his books. He took refuge in London at the Savoy Hospital, where he ministered until, after the ejection of Daniel Featley, he was appointed rector of Lambeth on 30 September 1643, and given the use of Featley's library until his own could be recovered. He was chosen one of the Westminster Assembly, and at their opening service in St. Margaret's, Westminster (25 September 1643) prayed a full hour to prepare them for taking the Solemn League and Covenant. He regularly attended the sittings of the assembly, and signed the petition for the right to refuse the sacrament to scandalous persons, presented to the House of Lords, 12 August, was one of the assessors, and in 1645 was chosen on the committee of accommodation. White brought William Benn to Lambeth with him, whom he had called in 1629 to be the incumbent of All Saints, Dorchester. On the death of Robert Pinck in November 1647, White was made warden of New College, but he declined to go to Oxford because of bad health (1648). His death took place on 21 July 1648, and he was buried in the porch of St. Peter's Chapel (belonging to Trinity).

He was capped eleven times for Wales and captained the team on two occasions. In 1888, Thomas was chosen to tour New Zealand and Australia as part of the first British Isles team. This unofficial tour did not play any international opposition and no caps were awarded. Thomas was born in Fishguard in 1866 to E.B. Thomas of Pembrokeshire. He was educated at Llandovery College before graduating to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1885. Rugby career In 1885, while still a schoolboy at Llandovery College,Godwin (1984), pg 10. Thomas was selected for the final Welsh game of the Home Nations Championship. Captained by Newport's Charlie Newman, Wales engineered a draw through unsporting tactics, mainly by killing the ball whenever possible by lying on it. Thomas was reselected for both Welsh games of the 1886 Home Nations Championship, still representing Llandovery for the opening game against England at Blackheath, but having progressed to the Cambridge University team by the time Wales hosted Scotland a week later. Wales lost both matches, but in the second game at the Cardiff Arms Park against Scotland, Thomas was part of the first Welsh team to trial the four three-quarter system. In 1886 and 1887, Thomas was on the winning Cambridge team in the Varsity match against Oxford, collecting two sporting Blues. Thomas played twice in the 1887 Championship, in the losses to England and Scotland, but missed the win over Ireland when he was replaced by William Towers. Thomas was back for both games of the 1888 Championship, but by now was representing London based exiles, London Welsh. The opening game saw the first Welsh win over Scotland, thanks to a debut try from Thomas Pryce- Jenkins. This was also the first winning international game Thomas had been part of, though the team could not capitalise on their success when they were beaten by Ireland in the second and final game of the tournament. Thomas missed the next four games for Wales, including the historic match against the New Zealand Natives, but returned for the second game of the 1890 Championship. After having lost to Scotland in the tournament opener, Thomas was back in the pack to face England. Now captained by Wales rugby legend Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales won an historic victory over the English, after some clever line-out play by William Stadden. This was the first time Wales had beaten England and the result gave Wales a chance of taking the tournament title when they face Ireland two weeks later. The Welsh were unable to take advantage of their England win, when they drew, with a goal apiece, at Lansdowne Road. Wales were heading towards defeat before a late Charlie Thomas try gave Wales an equaliser. More notable was the fight between the two sides at the after-match dinner, in which nine players found themselves in Dublin Court the next day. The press did not release the names of the culprits, so it is not known if Thomas was among them.Godwin (1984), pg 25. Thomas represented Wales twice more, when he was given the captaincy in the final two games of the 1891 Championship. Thomas was now playing for Llanelli, and his final match was to lead his country out in a win over Ireland at Stradey Park.

It contains only two genera, each with a single species: Lepidobotrys staudtii and Ruptiliocarpon caracolito.Klaus Kubitzky. \\"Lepidobotryaceae\\" In: Klaus Kubitzki (ed.). The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants vol.VI. Springer-Verlag: Berlin,Heidelberg, Germany (2004).  Description  The Lepidobotryaceae are dioecious trees. The leaves are alternate and arranged in two rows along the stems. The blade is elliptical in shape and the margin is entire. The leaves appear simple, but are actually unifoliate. A unifoliate leaf is a type of compound leaf that consists of a single leaflet mounted on the end of a rachis. A joint occurs where the leaflet is attached to the rachis.Glossary In: Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. In: Missouri Botanical Garden Website. (see External links below). In Lepidobotryaceae, this joint bears a single, elongate stipel and a pair of small stipules where the petiole attaches to the stem. After the emergence of the leaf, the stipel and stipules soon fall away. The flowers are produced in small inflorescences opposite the leaves.Barry E. Hammel, and Nelson A. Zamora (1993). \\"Ruptiliocarpon (Lepidobotryaceae): A New Arborescent Genus and Tropical American Link to Africa, with a Reconsideration of the Family\\". Novon 3(4):408-417. They are small and greenish with five sepals and five petals. The sepals and petals are similar in size and appearance, free from each other, or very shortly united at the base. In the flower bud, the sepals are arranged quincuncially. This means that two are inside, two are outside, and one of them has one margin exposed and the other covered.Benjamin D. Jackson. A Glossary of Botanic Terms. Duckworth: London (1928). The nectary disk is fleshy in Lepidobotrys, but extended into a tube in Ruptiliocarpon. The stamens are in two whorls of five, one whorl opposite the sepals and the other opposite the petals. Those in the outer whorl, opposite the sepals, are longer. The filaments are fused at the base, shortly in Lepidobotrys, but forming an extension of the tubular nectary in Ruptiliocarpon. The pollen is produced in four thecae on each anther. The stigmas are elongated, appearing as false styles, known as stylodia. The ovary is located inside the flower, rather than below. It has two or three locules, with two ovules per locule. The ovules are attached to the partition that separates the locules, near its summit. The fruit is a capsule with one, or rarely, two seeds. The seeds are black and partly covered with an orange aril. In 2000, a DNA analysis of the eudicots based on the rbcL gene showed that the families Lepidobotryaceae, Parnassiaceae, and Celastraceae form a strongly supported clade.Vincent Savolainen, Michael F. Fay, Dirk C. Albach, Anders Backlund, Michelle van der Bank, Kenneth M. Cameron, S.A. Johnson, M. Dolores Lledo, Jean-Christophe Pintaud, Martyn P. Powell, Mary Clare Sheahan, Douglas E.

Chase (2000). \\"Phylogeny of the eudicots: a nearly complete familial analysis based on rbcL gene sequences\\". Kew Bulletin 55(2):257-309. The authors of this study recommended that these three families constitute the order Celastrales. This result was strongly supported by later studies.Li-Bing Zhang and Mark P. Simmons (2006). \\"Phylogeny and Delimitation of the Celastrales Inferred from Nuclear and Plastid Genes\\". Systematic Botany 31(1):122-137.Hengchang Wang, Michael J. Moore, Pamela S.

The families into which Lepidobotrys had usually been placed, Linaceae and Oxalidaceae, are now placed in the orders Malpighiales and Oxalidales, respectively, which are closely related to Celastrales. The orders Celastrales, Oxalidales, and Malpighiales, along with the unplaced family Huaceae form a group known as the COM clade of the rosids.

The name Murdostoun was derived from the words Murthock and Toun which meant dwelling of Murthock. Murdostoun can refer to the ancient barony of the Scott and then the Inglis clan, the castle built by the Scotts or a bridge over the South Calder Water. The Estate The Murdostoun Estate contained many farms. The main ones were: Foulburn, Castlehill, Easthouse, Westhouse, Penty, Muimailing, Easterhill, Westerhill and Shapenknowe. Other near the Murdostoun Castle were Eastwood, Westwood, Rosebank and Heughbank. The estate was reported to consist of 1,760 acres in 1872.Inland Revenue. Owners of Lands and Heritages, 1872. The former Allanton Estate lay just to the east. =Murdostoun Castle= Murdostoun Castle lies 1100 meters west- northwest of the village of Bonkle. Murdostoun Castle was built by the Scott family in the 15th Century and was constructed as a keep or fortified residence. It stands on a good position high above the South Calder Water and was one of many built as a defensive measure across the Forth and Clyde Valley. The typical design of these houses was of a tall square block of three storeys, set within a courtyard, with thick walls and battlements. For security, no access from the ground floor to the two floors above, could be made. The main hall on the first floor was reached by a removable staircase from the Courtyard and access to the top floor, where the sleeping quarters were located, was by a narrow stair within the walls. Other rooms were also created within the walls. The roofs were made of stone for protection against fire attacks and parapets and fighting platforms were provided around the wall tops. =Murdostoun Bridge= Murdostoun Bridge, dated to 1817, is a single-span segmental-arch bridge constructed predominantly of yellow ashlar sandstone, with chamfered wing wall, hoodmoulded arch ring and low ashlar parapets. Murdostoun Bridge crosses the South Calder Water which divided the Murdostoun Estate from the Allanton estate. The river is also the parish boundary. Equidistant between the Allanton estate village of Bonkle and Murdostoun Castle. The bridge was probably built by the Stewarts of Allanton, stylistically it is similar to the triple span Allanton House bridge. The date of 1817 matches many of the cottages in Bonkle, the Allanton estate village whereas the Murdostoun estate was unoccupied at this time. History The Barony of Murdostoun once included the lands of Hartwood and extended east as far as Hilhouserig and Hartwood Burn. =The Murthock Family (1241-1296)= The Family Murthock can be traced back as far as the reign of Alexander III of Scotland. =The Scott Family (1296-1466)= In 1296 Sir Richard Scott married the daughter and heiress of Murdostoun and became the owner of the properties of Murdostoun and Hardwood, and as feudal lord swore fealty to Edward I of England. Sir Richard died in 1320. His descendent, Sir David Scott, sat in the Parliament held in Edinburgh in 1487 as 'Dominus de Baccleuch.' His son, Sir Michael Scott, heir of Murdostoun, distinguished himself at the Battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. He was slain at the Battle of Durham, 17 October 1346. He was succeeded by his elder son Robert, who died in 1389 who in turn was succeeded by his son Walter Scott of Murdostoun and Rankelburn. On 7 December 1389 he obtained a charter from Robert II of the superiorities of Kirkurd, and was honoured by a knighthood. On 23 July 1446 by a charter of Excambion the Scotts' lands of Murdostoun and Hartwood were exchanged with Thomas Inglis for his half of the Barony of Branxholm in Roxburghshire. =The Inglis Family (1466-1719)= Their earliest home was at Branxholm on the River Teviot in Roxburghshire. Their founder was Sir William Inglis, who at a Border foray in 1395 answered the challenge of an English champion, Sir Thomas Struthers, and killed him in single combat. As a reward for his prowess King Robert III made Sir William Inglis, a grant of the barony of Manor, RoxburghshireManor, which seems to have included the whole Manor Valley, a glen running south from the River Tweed about three miles west of Peebles, and known to readers of Sir Walter Scott as the scene of The Black Dwarf. Not long after the affair of Rulehaugh the Inglises seized opportunities of getting rid of Branxholm. On January 31, 1420 John Inglis of Manor, son of Sir William Inglis, granted a charter conveying half of Branxholm to Sir Robert Scott of Murdostoun in Lanarkshire, who already owned an extensive domain in Ettrick Forest and Teviotdale. Thomas Inglis, John's eldest son, found the frequent incursions of the English cattle-raiders a source of annoyance; accordingly he arranged with Sir Walter Scott, Sir Robert's successor, to exchange the rest of Branxholm with the Scott lands in Lanarkshire, and on July 23, 1446 the bargain was embodied in a charter of excambion. The Scotts settled at Branxholm, which forms part of the Buccleuch estates to this day; while Thomas Inglis removed to Lanarkshire. On his death, Murdostoun went to his eldest son, Thomas, and his heirs, who also held for a time the superiority of Manor. The property of Manor went to John, the second son, but in time it became restricted to Manorhead, a farm at the top of the glen, which remained in the younger branch of the family till 1709, when it was sold. The Inglis family remained in residence at Murdostoun for about the next 300 years. The old stock of Inglises ended with Thomas Inglis of Murdostoun, who succeeded about 1696, and sold the estate to Alexander Inglis, merchant in Edinburgh, second son of David Inglis of Fingask, and a descendant of the Inglises of Inglistarvit, Fife. The death of Alexander Inglis in 1719 signalled the end of the connection of this part of the Inglis family with the Barony of Murdostoun. Alexander Inglis, having no heirs, bequeathed the Estate to his nephew Alexander Hamilton, with the proviso that he took the Inglis name. =The Inglis-Hamiltons (1719-1850)= Alexander Inglis Hamilton's three sons succeeded in turn. The eldest, Alexander Inglis Hamilton, died on April 27, 1783; the second, Gavin Inglis Hamilton (1730–97), was the historical painter and archeologist at Rome; the youngest, Major- General James Inglis Hamilton, distinguished himself in the American Revolutionary War, and died on July 27, 1803. He adopted, James Anderson, the son of a sergeant-major at Saratoga, New York. He re-entailed Murdostoun on his adopted son, James Anderson, who took the surname Inglis-Hamilton. Colonel James Inglis Hamilton, Laird of Murdostoun, died at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. =The Stewarts (1850-1979)=History of the Stewart family Stewart trained in accountancy before acquiring his father's iron and coal business at Cleland. Discovery of a seam of blackband ironstone led to considerable wealth. He joined the Glasgow Town Council in 1842 and took up a series of posts: as river bailie in 1843, ordinary magistrate in 1845 and senior bailie or acting chief magistrate in 1847. He was active, on horseback and in his office, in suppressing civil disturbances in 1848. He period as Lord Provost, which ended in 1854, coincided with the question of a water supply for Glasgow. He retired from the council at the end of 1855 and died on 12 September 1866. He had married Isabella King in 1852 and she, along with a daughter and two sons, survived him. MR. STEWART, like several of his predecessors in the office of Lord Provost, was a native of Glasgow. He was born in 1810. His father was a native of Ayrshire, a circumstance which awakened in the breast of his son, while he was still a mere boy, a longing to connect himself with that county by the purchase of an estate as soon as fortune should enable him to do so - a desire, however, which, in as far as Ayrshire was concerned, was not destined to be fulfilled. At a very early age he was placed in the counting-house of Mr. Dixon of Govanhill, father of the late Mr. Dixon of Belleisle, and there he acquired a thorough knowledge of finance and accounts, and also a practical knowledge of the coal and iron businesses. On the death of his father, who for several years had carried on the business of an iron and coal master at Omoa on the estate of Cleland, belonging to the family of Stair, Mr. Stewart reconstructed the works, and having acquired in lease an extensive mineral field, which was found to contain an excellent seam of blackband ironstone, he in the course of a few years acquired a considerable fortune, to which after years of great success were to make great additions. Notwithstanding the claims which his business had upon him, he found that he had sufficient time to devote to municipal affairs, and accordingly he became a member of the Town Council in 1842 as one of the representatives of what was then known as the second ward, the ward in which his own Mansion House of Parson's Green was situated. In 1843, and when he had been only one year in the Town Council, he was appointed to the office of River Bailie, in immediate succession to the late Mr. Alexander Baird, of Gartsherrie fame. In 1845 he was elected as one of the ordinary magistrates; and in 1847 he attained the office of senior bailie, or acting chief magistrate. In the autumn of that year Mr. Hastie, the then Lord Provost, was elected as one of the two representatives of the city in Parliament, one result of which was that he was resident chiefly in London, and another, that the duties which, had he been resident in Glasgow, he would have required to discharge personally, were devolved upon, and had to be performed by Mr. Stewart, as acting chief magistrate. In the early part of 1848 trade was, in consequence of the mercantile depression which began in the course of the previous year, in a wretchedly bad condition, and many of the population were out of employment, and consequently in a state bordering upon starvation. Moreover, a few weeks previously another revolution had overthrown the Government of Louis Philippe; and the whole of Europe was in a state of excitement and discontent. It is not to be wondered at that in such circumstances there was in this populous district a strong tendency to disturbances, and, indeed, disturbances did ensue, not, it is to be added, without some loss of life and also some destruction of property. Of course Mr. Stewart had to play a prominent part as the actual head of the magistracy, and that he performed his part well was universally admitted. When the Colonel of the regiment of cavalry which had been called out to assist in the suppression of the disturbances appeared on the scene with a squadron, Mr. Stewart, who by the way was an excellent horseman, mounted the horse of an orderly dragoon, rode with the Colonel and his men into the very thick of the fray, and acted with great decision and promptitude; and the disturbances were speedily suppressed. Indeed, under a man of less courage, less judgment, and less force of character the loss of life would have been very serious and the injury to property immense, to say nothing of the effect which a successful riot would have had on the working population of all the adjacent mining and manufacturing districts. In 1851, on the expiration of Sir James Anderson's term of office, Mr. Stewart was elected as his successor - many of his supporters thus seeking to recognize the very valuable services rendered by him in the trying scenes of 1848. In 1852 Mr. Stewart was married to Miss Isabella King, one of the daughters of a well-known and highly esteemed citizen, the late Mr. King of Levernholm Campsie. Shortly after his elevation to the office of Lord Provost, Mr. Stewart applied himself to the important question of a water supply for Glasgow, a task in which he had the valuable support of his esteemed friend the late Bailie James Gourlay, in the memoir of whom will be found a very full and most interesting account of the violent opposition which the scheme encountered. Suffice it to say here that the opposition only tended to increase the perseverance and the energy of Mr. Stewart; and ultimately - and, as is well known, to a great extent through the influence which he had with the Prime Minister of the day, Lord Palmerston, of whom two or three years previously he had become a personal friend - the Water Bill was carried, the benefit which it conferred being beyond all question one of the greatest boons ever conferred upon the city. When we think of the obloquy which was heaped upon Mr. Stewart, on the virulence with which he was assailed, on the worry to which from first to last he was subjected, and on the weeks, nay the months of anxiety which he had to pass through, all in his endeavours to procure for his fellow-citizens a bountiful supply of pure water, we do not feel surprised that his health became affected and that the seeds were laid of the disease which was destined not many years afterwards to terminate a career of so much worth and so much usefulness to the community at large.(1) In 1856 Mr. Stewart acquired from Mr. Baillie Cochrane, now Lord Lamington, at a cost of £55,000, the estate of Murdostoun, situated in the parish of Shotts, Lanarkshire, and immediately began to improve it upon an extensive scale and with great taste.(2) We should mention that, although his Provostship terminated in 1854, Mr. Stewart remained in the Town Council until the end of 1855, in order that, as Chairman of the Water Scheme, he might give the town the benefit of his services in carrying through the Bill. On retiring from the Council he ceased to take any interest in municipal affairs; but as a county proprietor he took an active part in all county matters. Mr. Stewart died suddenly, of heart disease, on 12 September 1866, survived by his wife, by a daughter, and by two sons, the elder of whom, Mr. Robert King Stewart, B.A., is proprietor of Murdostoun and Langbyres, and the younger, Mr. William Lindsay Stewart, is proprietor of the lands of Stanmore, situate in the upper ward of Lanarkshire. (1) To commemorate Provost Stewart's services to the community a Memorial Fountain has been erected in the West-End Park at the expense of the City. (2) This property belonged down to the middle of the 15th century to the Scotts of Buccleuch, and was then exchanged by them for part of the lands of Branxholme in Roxburghshire, belonging to a family of the name of Inglis. In later times Murdostoun belonged to James Inglis Hamilton, who commanded the Scots Greys at Waterloo, and who was killed at the head of his regiment in the somewhat reckless charge which our heavy cavalry made on Marshal Ney's \\"grand battery.\\" It then passed to Admiral the Hon. Sir Alexander Inglis Cochrane, captor of the Danish West India Islands, and next, in 1832, to his son the late Admiral Sir Thomas Inglis Cochrane, the father of Lord Lamington. This estate Mr. Stewart added to in 1865 by the purchase of the lands of Langbyres, situate in the vicinity of Murdostoun. Robert Stewart Murdostoun Castle was acquired by Robert Stewart (b. 1811), son of Robert Stewart and Mary Herbert of Stair, East Ayrshire, in 1850 from Lord Lamington for £55,000.MacLehose, James.

Major Stewart died suddenly in a nursing home in Edinburgh on 8 February 1927, following an operation. Funeral services were held at Blairingone Church on Friday, February 11.The Scotsman, Edinburgh, February 2, 1927. He was survived by his wife, a daughter, and a son, who continued to reside at the Arndean estate. Mr. John Christie, Lady Stewart's father, died in 1902. Lady Stewart received title to the 3,000 acre Ardean Estate near Blairingone as her portion of the estate. The Stewarts usually wintered abroad to escape the worst of the Scottish winter. Murdostoun was the first house in Scotland to receive electric lighting in September 1882. The electricity was generated by a steam powered generator. They acquired a motorcar in 1908 and the telephone was installed in 1910. The Stewarts were active in World War I. John Christie Stewart served as staff captain. Alexander Caldwell Stewart joined the Cameronians. He was wounded at the Battle of Festubert in 1915 for which he received the Military Cross. Alice ran three hospitals. Robert served as convenor of the County Council, director of the Red Cross, and served with the Territorial Army for which he was honoured as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). Major Alexander Caldwell Stewart was wounded again and received a bar to the Military Cross. Alice was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her work. Sir Robert King Stewart, KBE, died in December 1930 at the age of 78. Lady Alice then removed to Cleghorn House, about eight miles from Murdostoun, in what is now South Lanarkshire to allow her son to have full use of Murdostoun Castle. Lady Alice Christie King Stewart, O.B.E., J. P., died at Cleghorn House on September 5, 1940 after catching a chill in her garden.

Sir Robert King Stewart and his son, Captain John Christie Stewart each served as Grand Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, the latter serving 1942 to 1945. The Stewarts were related to the famous Victorian lady traveller and author, Miss Isabella (Ella) Robertson Christie (b. 1861, d. 1949), sister of Lady Alice Margaret Christie Stewart (b. about 1863, d. September 1940), and to the family of John Hill of Homestead Plantation, West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, whose mother, Isabella Christie (sister to Alexander Christie of Milnwood, Lanarkshire), married George Hill (b. 1785, d. 1852) of Old Monkland, Lanarkshire, where he had an ironworks.

Mrs Averil Stewart published a book of poetry, Mercury in the Garden, in 1946. Mrs. Stewart also wrote a memoir of her mother-in-law, Lady Alice Christie King Stewart, and the sister of the mother-in-law, Miss Ella Christie, entitled Alicella, which was published in 1955 by John Murray of London. The Stewarts remodeled Murdostoun Castle into a very comfortable residence. They were fond of their dogs and created a pet cemetery in which their dogs were buried. Mrs. Averil Stewart died in April 1975 and Captain John Stewart died in May 1978. They are interred in a family mausoleum in Cambusnethan Church cemetery in Cambusnethan, a large suburb on the eastern side of Wishaw. Captain and Mrs. Stewart had no children. After their deaths, the Murdostoun estate passed to a great nephew and the property was sold in 1979. The National Library of Scotland has an inventory of family papers from Murdostoun Castle, which are stored in boxes at the library. Murdostoun Castle today Murdostoun Castle was recently used as an alcohol-related brain damage care unit. This facility was managed by Four Seasons Health Care, Ltd. Murdostoun Castle has three main buildings set in of mixed park and woodland. The Frank Jamieson wing was a modern purpose built facility, providing nursing and social care in a selection of differing rooms for single occupancy. As well as bright airy rooms, a large conservatory and enclosed garden area are available. The two care facilities closed down for refurbishment in 2010 leaving just the 20-bed brain injury rehabilitation centre. Recent refurbishment by the Huntercombe Group saw the newer buildings on the site managed as rehabilitation and care centres from a variety of neurological conditions while the castle is home to the Abbeycare Foundation, a private addiction centre.

Rector: Adam Mickiewicz University - Poznań, Poland (1945–1946). Biography Stefan Tytus Zygmunt Dąbrowski of Radwan coat of arms was born on January 31, 1877, in Warsaw, Poland, into an intelligentsia family (Żądło-Dąbrowski z Dąbrówki h. Radwan). Dąbrowski's szlachta (noble) family was a fundamental influence on his life, which included growing up in an atmosphere of patriotism in the environs of Warsaw at the end of the nineteenth century. In January 1919, Poland's Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, made Dąbrowski Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs. On May 11, 1939, the Senate of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań chose Dąbrowski, a professor, for the position of rector; however, the explosion of war beginning with Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, made the accession of Dąbrowski's rectorial duties impossible. Dąbrowski had foreknowledge of events in 1939, and spent the duration of the war in many localities hiding from the Gestapo, Nazi Germany's secret police. Under the Nazi's Generalplan Ost, more than 61,000 Polish activists, intelligentsia, nobles (szlachta), actors, former officers, etc. (all those deemed capable of rousing the Polish people to defense and patriotic action), were to be interned or shot. (See: Operation Tannenberg, Operation Sonderaktion Krakau, and Massacre of Lwów professors.) Nazi racist ideology dictated the Polish elite were largely Nordic, and thus capable of dynamic leadership, therefore their liquidation or internment would deprive the Slavonic masses of Poland of any effective resistance.

History Weybosset in the Narragansett language meant, crossing place, at a narrow place that Indians used to walk from one side of the bay to the other, presumably during low to mid-tides. Weybosset is just south of the convergence of two rivers, Woonasquatucket and Moshassuck, flowing south into the Providence River, at the upper end of Narragansett Bay. Weybosset was also where three important native Indian trails met, one coming down from the north, the second up from the southeast Mount Hope region called the Wampanoag Trail, and the third up from Connecticut in the southwest called the Pequot Trail. Later the Weybosset name was given to a wooden colonial toll bridge built by the early settlers across the Providence River at the entrance to the Cove. Roger Williams (1603–1683), founder of Providence and the Rhode Island Colony, served for a time as the toll taker at Weybosset in his elderly years. Gradually the Cove was filled in and built upon in what is now called Downtown Providence. The old wood bridge was replaced several times with steel and concrete bridges. Once referred to at the world's widest bridge, the Weybosset Street Bridge is part of the Waterplace Park and Riverwalk, built in 1994, where popular WaterFire celebrations are held during some summer evenings. Weybosset Street currently begins at the north end of Broad Street at the intersection of Empire Street, and continues northeast joining Westminster Street to cross the river at the foot of College Street, in Providence, Rhode Island.

He retired in 2013 as Inspector General of Police (IGP), Jammu and head of the Sher-I-Kashmir Police Academy at Udhampur. Khan is known for the creation of the Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP) Special Task Force (STF) as well as being its first head in 1995; STF would later go on to be renamed as the Special Operations Group (SOG). He joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014 and was appointed the national secretary of the party in June 2015. He also served as the 32nd Administrator of Lakshadweep till July 2019. Following this he was advisor to governor Satya Pal Malik, after which he was an advisor to the first Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir and currently holds the position.  Background  Farooq is a Dogri-speaking Punjabi Muslim of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Farooq comes from a police background, his father, Sardar Mohammed Sarwar Khan, was also a police officer, who retired as a Superintendent of Police. His mother is Khalida Begum; and he has one brother and two sisters. His grandfather, Colonel Peer Mohammad, was the first state president of the Jammu and Kashmir Bharatiya Jana Sangh. As part of Hari Singh's Dogra army, Colonel Peer Mohammad also had a major role in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948.  Life  Career in police = Creation of JKP Special Operations Group  Khan was first part of the Kashmir Police Service in 1984, and went on to get his first field posting as Sub-Divisional Police Officer in Bhaderwah in 1986. In the 1990s, militancy in Kashmir was at a peak. State institutions including those for law and order enforcement barely functioned. In mid-1993, the force saw indiscipline in the form of a strike in PCR Srinagar. Farooq Khan, a junior Superintendent of Police at the time, was one of the officers responsible for building up the police force again. It was only in November 1993 when the police started taking an effective part in counter-insurgency operations in the region along with the other security forces. It was at this time when the JKP felt the need for creating an elite unit with commando like capabilities that could perform counter-terrorism operations. The concept was of \\"involving the passive Jammu and Kashmir Police in anti-terrorist activities and giving a local face to these operations\\". This group would be called the JKP anti-militancy Task Force or Special Task Force. The STF would later be renamed the Special Operations Group. Khan was the first head of STF in 1994. Khan had the backing of the Director-General of Police at the time, M.N. Sabharwal. The first time the STF tasted success was in a joint operation with the 26 Punjab Regiment in which three Al-Fatah militants were killed in October 1994. In 1995, the STF had only one Srinagar based unit headed by Farooq Khan but the concept was soon expanded following its \\"spectacular successes\\" in the valley. In 1994, Khan had shifted to the Indian Police Service. As an IPS officer in-charge of the STF he had an important part in the clearing of the Hazratbal Shrine in March 1996. Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) militants had laid siege to the shrine and had taken hostages. After a three-day standoff, nine militants and two policemen were killed while 20 militants surrendered. Some time later, Indian security forces went on to kill 22 militants who were holed up in the shrine. Under Farooq Khan's STF, with the support of other security agencies including the Army, the counter- insurgent pro-government militia Ikhwanul Muslimoon (Ikhwan), started by Kuka Parray, was strengthened and together they killed more than 2000 militants. Khan's STF and the Army have been given credit for making possible the first elections in the 1990s in the region - the 1996 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election and the 1996 Indian general election in Jammu and Kashmir. Khan was also part of operations against militants who had attacked the Raghunath Temple, Jammu and Panjbakhtar Temple, Jammu in late 2002.  Chattisinghpora, Pathribal, and Barakpora case  When Farooq Khan was a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Anantnag, he was suspended for two years in 2003 for his alleged role in Pathribal fake encounter on 25 March 2000. In the encounter, the Indian Army claimed to have killed 5 militants responsible for the killing of 36 Sikhs in Chattisinghpora village, Anantnag, on 20 March 2000. In a related incident on 3 April 2000, 8 demonstrators were killed by SOG men in Brakpora, Anantnag. Farooq Abdullah set up a commission to look into the incidents. The Kuchai Commission, under retired Justice GA Kuchai of Jammu and Kashmir High Court, found SSP Farooq Khan responsible for falsifying the DNA reports of the victims. The commission submitted its report in December 2002. Following this another commission, the Justice SR Pandian commission, a retired Supreme Court judge, looked into the case, and while it again found multiple people guilty, it found that Farooq was not involved in the killings or in fudging of DNA. After more public outrage, the case was handed to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which started its investigation on 14 February 2003. In 2006 the CBI filed its chargesheet holding seven soldiers of Rashtriya Rifles 7th battalion responsible for the Pathribal fake encounter. Now that Farooq Khan was absolved by charges by both the Pandian commission and the CBI investigation, he was reinstated into the police force. Khan had also approached the Central Administrative Tribunal as well as the Jammu and Kashmir High Court for justice, after which the Ministry of Home Affairs cleared his name. In the end no one was found guilty for the three incidents after the Army fought the case in the Supreme Court of India. Khan retired as IGP Jammu and as the head of the Sher-e-Kashmir Police Academy, Udhampur. = Joined Bharatiya Janata Party = Khan joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on 26 March 2014, before the 2014 Indian general elections, during a political rally in Hiranagar, Kathua district in the presence of Narendra Modi. In June 2015 he was appointed national secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Farooq, apart from being a BJP spokesperson, has also been in-charge of BJP Minority Morcha and BJP's affairs in farthest North-Eastern state of Nagaland. Khan has also commented on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), calling RSS \\"leaders disciplined and dedicated\\" and justifies his support by saying \\"What’s wrong in standing for Hindutva? Are there not organisations that stand for Islam, Christianity? Just because Hindus are majority, you cannot say standing for them is a crime.\\" = Administrator of Lakshadweep = Khan was the 32nd Administrator of the Union Territory of Lakshadweep between September 2016 and July 2019. He arrived in Lakshadweep on 12 September 2016. As Lakshadweep Administrator, he was in- charge of relief work after cyclones hit the islands in 2017. He inaugurated the \\"Lakshadweep District Panchayat Bhavan\\" as well as the \\"Annual Academic Conference of Principal and Headmasters.\\" As part of other routine functions of the Administrator, he also hurled the flag on the formation day of Lakshadweep on 1 November.

The foundation stone of the \\"world’s first ever Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Powered Desalination Project\\" was laid in Kavaratti by Union Minister Harsh Vardhan in the presence of Farooq Khan. = Advisor to JK Governor/ Lieutenant Governor = On 13 July 2019, Farooq Khan was appointed as the fifth advisor to the then Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Satya Pal Malik. Farooq Khan was the first advisor to Governor Satya Pal Malik to request withdrawal of his security convoy. Following this he was adviser to Lieutenant Governor G. C. Murmu, and then Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha. As advisor, his official role is related to \\"food civil supplies and consumer affairs, social welfare, tribal affairs, labour and employment, youth services and sports, election and Haj and Auqaf\\" among other things.

While at the club, Gloves has a drink with Leda that is interrupted by her piano player, Pepi (Peter Lorre), who takes her away to a back room, where he shoots Marty's partner, Joe Denning (Edward Brophy). Leda and Pepi then disappear in a taxi as Gloves stumbles upon Joe. Before dying, Joe raises up five fingers to indicate who took Leda. Gloves quickly leaves to search for Leda, inadvertently leaving one of his gloves at the murder scene. While being suspected of Joe's murder by Marty and the police, Gloves traces the taxi to an antiques/auction house operated by Hall Ebbing (Conrad Veidt) and his assistant, Madame (Judith Anderson). While posing as a bidder, Gloves is recognized by Pepi. He subsequently gets knocked out by Leda, tied up, and left in a storage room with one of his boys, Sunshine (William Demarest), who was earlier captured. Later, Leda visits them, enabling them to break free from their ropes before they are packed up in crates and shipped out. Before escaping, Gloves and Sunshine walk into a room with maps, charts, a short-wave radio, and a portrait of Adolf Hitler. They realize that their captors are \\"fivers\\" or Nazi fifth columnists, which is what Joe was indicating before he died. Gloves finds a notebook and reads Miller's name in it as well as that of \\"Leda Hamilton\\", her Jewish name \\"Uda Hammel\\", and the death of her father in Dachau concentration camp. With Leda in tow, they escape. They are chased by Ebbing and his cronies into Central Park. Here, Leda explains that she is working with Ebbing only to save her father's life. While Gloves fights with a Nazi, Leda reads the torn-out page that states her father is already dead. Gloves and Leda go to the police, who search the antique house, but find it empty. Not believing Gloves's story, they attempt to arrest him, but he escapes by diving into the East River. He arrives at his lawyer's (Wallace Ford) apartment, only to have Marty and his mob break in, eager to avenge Joe's murder. After Gloves convinces them of his innocence, the two gangs join forces against the Nazi spies. Gloves, Sunshine, and Barney (Frank McHugh) go to the police station where Leda is being held. Ebbing, however, has bailed her out, and they arrive as she is being forced into a car. They chase the car to a shop where an underground Nazi meeting is being held. Gloves and Sunshine pose as Nazis they capture to get into the meeting. When the explosives expert Gloves is impersonating is called on the brief the members on his sabotage efforts Gloves and Sunshine stall using a double talk ruse until the meeting gets broken up by the combined gangs. Ebbing escapes, shooting Pepi to death, as he refused to take part in a two-man suicide mission. Ebbing intends to proceed with the plan to blow up a battleship in New York harbor. Gloves follows him to the docks, where Ebbing surprises him and forces him into a motorboat containing high explosives. At gunpoint, Ebbing forces Gloves to steer the boat toward the battleship. Gloves suddenly steers the boat off course and jumps into the water, while the boat with Ebbing still on board crashes into a barge and explodes. Back at the police station, Gloves and Leda find out that all charges have been dropped and that the mayor is going to honor him at city hall. Ma Donahue enters complaining that the milkman has disappeared, and she is afraid something has happened to him. Gloves asks: \\"What makes you think that?\\" Ma states, \\"Well, son, I've got a feeling\\".

Warner, who personally phoned director Vincent Sherman to ensure that they would be added to the cast. * Kaaren Verne and Peter Lorre married in 1945, and divorced in 1950. Production Production was completed in early October 1941, two months before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The film was released in New York on January 23, 1942. Producer Hal B. Wallis made All Through the Night as a \\"companion piece\\" to his earlier anti-Nazi melodrama, Underground, despite the poor box office of the prior film. Humphrey Bogart was not the first person considered for the lead in the film: it was originally supposed to be played by Walter Winchell, the gossip columnist who would later be the narrator for the TV series The Untouchables. When Winchell could not get the time off to make the film, Wallis offered it to George Raft, and then, when Raft turned it down, to Bogart. It was one of several parts Bogart played which had originally been offered to Raft. Olivia De Havilland and Marlene Dietrich were considered for the female lead.\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com On TCM.com, Mark Frankel reports that the scene in which Bogart and William Demarest confuse a room full of Nazi sympathizers with doubletalk was not part of the original script, “Sherman thought the idea up himself and presented it to producer Hal Wallis. Wallis hated the idea, but Sherman was so convinced that the film needed it, that he shot it anyway. When Wallis saw the scene in the rough cut, he angrily told Sherman to take it out. Sherman, however, left a bit of it in and when the film had a sneak preview, the audience ‘exploded with laughter' at the double-talk. Wallis told Sherman to put it all back in.” Reception Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 100% fresh rating based on ten contemporary reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. Leonard Maltin gives it 3 out of 4 stars: “Interesting blend of spy, gangster, and comedy genres, with memorable double-talk and auction scenes.” Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review, writing: \\"In spite of its slap-bang construction and its hour-and-three- quarters length, the picture does move with precision and steadily maintained suspense ... All Through the Night is not exactly a melodrama out of the top drawer, but it is a super-duper action picture — mostly duper, when you stop to think.\\" On Dec. 3, 1941, before the attack on Pear Harbor, a reviewer for Variety wrote: \\"Somewhat on the lurid side and with the Nazi menace motif of familiar timber, shortcomings are compensated for by fast-moving continuity which smartly builds suspense and hold (sic) attention.\\" By December 31, Variety had changed its tune: “Chase and gunbattle in Central Park, scraps in the warehouse district, the mystery girl in distress, emphasis on danger to American institutions from foreign conspirators add up to elementary but surefire audience appeal.” Film Daily called it a \\"fast-moving and exciting melodrama.\\" Russell Maloney of The New Yorker panned the film, writing that \\"Hitchcock himself couldn't have asked for a better plot,\\" but claiming that it was brought down by \\"the feebleness of invention, the wordiness of the dialogue, [and] the sluggishly paced direction.\\" =Box office= According to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,009,000 domestically and $959,000 foreign during its initial run. Variety estimated the film had earned $1.1 million domestically by the end of 1942.\\"101 Pix Gross in Millions\\" Variety 6 Jan 1943 p. 58 See also *America First Committee ReferencesExternal links  * * Category:1940s spy thriller films Category:1942 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American spy thriller films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Adolph Deutsch Category:Films directed by Vincent Sherman Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set on the home front during World War II Category:American gangster films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:World War II films made in wartime Category:World War II spy films ","title":"All Through the Night (film)"},{"id":"20907180","text":"\\"Joan of Arc\\" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen. It was released as a single in March 1971 from his third album, Songs of Love and Hate. The song lasts almost six-and-a-half minutes, and is composed of four stanzas of eight lines each with a \\"la-la\\" refrain.  Theme of the song  The song is constructed mainly as a dialogue between Joan of Arc and the fire which is consuming her as she burns at the stake, after having been found guilty of heresy (in 1431). In the song, Joan says that she is \\"tired of the war\\" and tells how she would rather be wearing a white wedding dress (one of the charges against her was that she dressed as a man). Joan's surrender to the fire, as its bride, may also be seen as a symbol of her religious fervor and commitment.  Background  This song was apparently inspired by Cohen's love for the German model Nico. It has also been noted that the structure in which the song is both sung and recited on parallel tracks (most obvious in the first and last four lines) was inspired by Medieval palimpsests.  Covers and translations  Judy Collins performed the song during her 1970 concert tour, and a live version from that tour appeared on her 1971 album Living; Collins continued to perform the song in her concerts into the 2010s. Jennifer Warnes covers the song on her album Famous Blue Raincoat as a duet with Cohen; a bonus live version was added to the 20th anniversary re-issue of the same album. Italian singer-songwriter Fabrizio de André wrote \\"Giovanna d'Arco\\", an Italian translation of \\"Joan of Arc\\", and included it on his 1974 album Canzoni. The Canadian singer Patricia O'Callaghan performs the song on her 2001 album Real Emotional Girl and on her 2012 album Matador: The Songs of Leonard Cohen. Irish singer, Pauline Scanlon covers it on her 2016 album Gossamer.

Early life and career  Corbett was a San Francisco native. He was an 1895 graduate of the engineering program at the University of California, Berkeley and then was educated at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. After his graduation in 1900, he started work in the firm of Cass Gilbert.Corbett, Harvey Wiley on artnet.com One of Corbett's early commissions during the 1910s was for the landmark Springfield Municipal Group, two large municipal buildings with a tower in Springfield, Massachusetts  Middle and later years  Bush Tower As part of the firm of Helmle & Corbett, Harvey Wiley Corbett designed Bush Tower, a 30-story Neo-Gothic skyscraper built for the Bush Terminal Company on 42nd St. near Times Square, Manhattan. The tower, \\"with its prominent position and slight setbacks in buff, white and black brick, marked his début as an influential skyscraper designer.\\" Corbett's next major commission was in London, where again working for Irving T. Bush and the Bush Terminal Co., he was the architect for Bush House, a massive and essentially American-style office building built within the limits of strict London building codes.Saint, Andrew (1984). \\"Americans in London: Raymond Hood and the National Radiator Building.\\" AA Files 7, 37–38.\\"The Bush House of London\\" (February 23, 1923). The New York Times, p. SM6-8 Later in the 1920s, Harvey Wiley Corbett was part of one of the three firms that designed Rockefeller Center in New York. Corbett, however, left the Rockefeller Center project in 1928, so he could work on plans for the Metropolitan Life North Building, designed as a 100-story skyscraper and the world's tallest building,\\"Madison Sq. Tower To Rise 100 Stories; Metropolitan Life Will Erect the Tallest Office Structure for Own Use on Whole Block (November 3, 1929), The New York Times, p. N1 but eventually built as a 32-story tower during the Great Depression. Corbett, continued to design some structures during the Great Depression, notably the massive New York City Criminal Courts Building in downtown Manhattan, the northern tower of which is the Manhattan Detention Center (The Tombs). The complex was designed with Charles B. Meyers and completed in 1941.Wolfe, Gerard R. (2003) New York, 15 Walking Tours: An Architectural Guide to the Metropolis. (New York: McGraw-Hill Professional ( ), p.102  Views and writings  According to his obituary in the New York Times, Corbett was a longtime and ardent champion of skyscrapers and modernism. In 1922, Corbett commissioned delineator and architect Hugh Ferriss to draw a series of four step-by-step perspectives demonstrating the architectural consequences of New York's \\"setback\\" zoning law. These four drawings would later be used in Ferriss's 1929 book The Metropolis of Tomorrow.Ferriss, Hugh. The Metropolis of Tomorrow (with essay by Carol Willis). New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1986. Reprint of 1929 edition. By demonstrating how architecture might evolve, Corbett's commission and Ferriss's book continue to influence popular culture; the Gotham City of Batman and the cities seen in the 2004 movie Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow both were influenced by Corbett and Ferriss. In the late 1920s, the impact of skyscrapers on cities and downtowns was still hotly debated. Harvey Corbett defended the benefits of tall buildings against skyscraper detractors in articles published in the New York Times Magazine and the National Municipal Journal in 1927.Fogelson Robert M., Downtown: Its Rise and Fall, 1880–1950 (2003). New London, CT: Yale University Press () p. 174 In 1930, Corbett described modernism in architecture as a \\"freeing of the shackles of style that for years have forced architects to erect duplicates of Grecian temples for bank buildings, regardless of modern requirements for light, air, and utility.\\"\\"Harvey Wiley Corbett, Architect, Dead\\" (April 22, 1954). The New York Times, p. 22 H.W. Corbett lectured at the Columbia School of Architecture at Columbia University in New York from 1907 to the 1930s, further influencing a generation of architects.  Legacy  George Washington Masonic National Memorial In addition to his work on skyscrapers, office buildings, and municipal buildings, Harvey Wiley Corbett designed monuments such as the Peace Arch (1921) on the Canada–US border and the George Washington Masonic National Memorial in Virginia (cornerstone laid in 1923). Later, Corbett shaped the course of architecture by heading the architectural committee of the 1933 World's Fair (the \\"Century of Progress\\" exhibition) in Chicago. He was also chairman of the advisory committee of architects that created the theme for the modernistic 1939 New York World's Fair. Both fairs were influential examples of modern architecture. Because of his work in America and England, Harvey Corbett was simultaneously a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and the Royal Institute of British Architects. One month before his death, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects granted him their annual award for career achievement.In 1926, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and became a full Academician in 1930.

Indonesia had been a Dutch colony since 1800 as a part of the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch were expelled in March 1942 by the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Sukarno declared independence on August 17, 1945. However, the Netherlands attempted to reestablish their colony during a prolonged war that lasted for four and a half years. Ultimately the struggle was unsuccessful for the Netherlands, and in December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesian sovereignty. The United States immediately recognized the independence of Indonesia and moved to establish diplomatic relations. A U.S. embassy was established in Jakarta on December 27, 1949, under the informal direction of a consul general. President Truman appointed H. Merle Cochran as ambassador the following day.

Bayles was killed in the crash of the Model Z during an attempt at the landplane speed record when the plane crashed at over mph. Early life Bayles was born in Mason, Illinois on January 24, 1900, the oldest child of Hattie and Rayford E. Bayles. He graduated from Newton, Illinois High School and attended the University of Illinois in mining engineering, but was forced to leave due to eye trouble. He was working as an electrician in various mines around Illinois when he began taking flying lessons. Flying Bayles began taking flying lessons from a former World War I instructor pilot. He eventually bought a surplus Curtiss JN-4 Jenny The Jenny was lost when he stopped over in Herrin, Illinois during a gang war between Charlie Birger and the Shelton Brothers Gang. Birger had been bombed from the air and he mistook Bayles' plane for the bomber and had the plane dynamited. After a stint back in the mines, Bayles began barnstorming around the country. In 1928 he partnered with H. Roscoe Brinton starting a flying service in Springfield, Massachusetts. Due to the Great Depression, orders for aircraft had stopped and the Granville Brothers Aircraft Company saw the air racing circuit as a way to stay in business. To raise seed money for the air racing operation, the \\"Springfield Air Racing Association\\" (SARA) was formed. A group of local Springfield merchants and businessmen who sought to promote Springfield bought shares to fund creation of the racing planes. Bayles added $500 of his own money to be the pilot in the venture. Bayles flew the Gee Bee Model X in the Cirrus Derby in 1930, coming in second and sharing the $7000 purse with the Granvilles. In 1931, Bayles piloted a Gee Bee Model E Sportster in the Ford National Reliability Air Tour, coming in fourth in the point standing and winning the Great Lakes Trophy for a total of $2000 in prize money. At the 1931 National Air Races, Bayles and the Gee Bee Model Z, christened the \\"City of Springfield,\\" cleaned up, first winning the $7500 Thompson Trophy prize with an average speed of , then the Shell Speed dash with an average of , breaking the speed record for the course, then won the Goodyear Trophy race with an average of .

On December 5, Bayles tried again, diving into the course from and leveling off at as rules allowed. Travelling over , from the ground, the Model Z suddenly pitched up, the right wing folded beyond the flying wire attachment point, most likely due to aileron flutter stressing the wing spar and causing it to fail. The plane crashed alongside a railroad track in a huge ball of flame and smoke. Lowell Bayles' body was thrown from the disintegrated plane. Analysis of the crash, based on motion picture film of the event examined frame-by-frame, showed that the aircraft's fuel cap had come loose and crashed through the Gee Bee Z's windscreen. It struck the pilot and incapacitated him, causing a sudden upset in pitch that led to the structural failure of the wing.Gee Bee Z. Air Racing History. Accessed 2010-05-26. In addition, tests of a reproduction aircraft have shown that the Gee Bee Z was susceptible to aerodynamic flutter at high speed.

The order of books is unusual: Acts, Pauline epistles, Catholic epistles and Gospels (as in codex 234). It contains three lacunae (2 Peter 3:2-17; Matthew 18:12-35; Mark 2:8-3:4). The text is divided according to the (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their (titles of chapters) at the top of the pages.

In 1636 William Laud presented the manuscript to the Bodleian Library. Mill pointed resemblance to the Complutensian text. It was examined by Mill (as Laud. 2), Bentley, and Griesbach. Bentley used it as codex γ. C. R. Gregory saw it in 1883. Formerly it was labelled by 51e for the Gospels, 32a for the Acts, and 38p for the Pauline epistles. Gregory in 1908 gave for it number 51.

The person performing the supplemental role is commonly called the Double. The task of the Double is to provide a link between the patient's internal reality and the external environment.Hudgins, M.

Thereby, the doubling can help provoke abreactive and mental catharsis, insight, and transformation. However, newer forms of Doubling focus less on an abreactive catharsis and more on an integrative catharsis since psychodrama has learned that too much emotion can be re-traumatizing to the client.

It's mandatory to gain approval from the vzw/asbl Atomium and the SABAM, before copying or broadcasting the image of the Atomium. It is also necessary to mention \\"copyright vzw/asbl Atomium\\".\\" SABAM is one of the Belgian associations of authors, composers and publishers. The bilingual acronym stands for \\"Société d'Auteurs Belge – Belgische Auteurs Maatschappij\\". Their headquarters is located at 75–77 rue d'Arlon in Brussels. SABAM was founded in 1922 at the instigation of the composer under the name NAVEA. In 1945 it changed to its current name. The SABAM is a Civil Co-operative Society (CVBA) with Belgian authors, composers and publishers as members. They represent the interests of its members in the field of intellectual property rights and collect all the royalties due to its members in Belgium, and sister organizations in other countries (such as Buma/Stemra in the Netherlands), and then distributes these royalties to the copyright holders. Unlike Buma/Stemra, which is limited to music copyright, SABAM is active in all disciplines where copyrights are involved. The members of SABAM are not only composers, poets and musicians, but also writers, artists, publishers, visual artists, architects, designers, choreographers, photographers, film and television directors, etc. SABAM also monitors the Internet to check the illegal supply of art. In 2004 SABAM filed a complaint against ISP Tiscali because of the illegal distribution of music over the Internet. A restaurant owner from Brussels was fined because he had a picture of the Atomium on his website. In October 2007, the SABAM was investigated by a Brussels court on suspicion of falsifying financial statements, the abuse of the confidence of its members and the laundering of misappropriated funds. The investigation, which was started by a complaint by the Walloon composer Philippe Delhaye, is ongoing. In August 2009 Google removed several music videos for Belgian artists from its video web site YouTube because of complaints made by SABAM.  Criticism  SABAM has received a lot of criticism from festival organisations for claiming money unjustifiably and having very unclear conditions; from artists for late payments (SABAM had a debt of 200 million EUR towards artists in 2010); and from many other people for demanding money in the strangest places, such as libraries for reading stories to toddlers or playing music in a taxi. SABAM has been criticised publicly in newspapers and TV shows. For example, in 2011, one of the episodes of the TV show Basta was dedicated to SABAM. As one of the actions, the people from comedy group Neveneffecten, makers of the show, organised a concert with imaginary artists, and sent the playlist to SABAM. SABAM charged as if all imaginary artists were a member of their organisation. SABAM however refunded the money after the episode was shown on the national television. Other ridiculing actions included organising a party on less than 1 m² (since the fees depended on the area of the party, and started only from 1 m²), or calling to SABAM to ask if they had to pay SABAM because their phone rang on a public place with a protected tune. SABAM has also been ridiculed in other shows.

Thompson (March 24, 1870 - July 3, 1949) was an American preacher, Christian Socialist, and Social Democratic politician. A Congregationalist minister early in his life, Thompson is best remembered as a lecturer and political organizer for the Socialist Party of America. Thompson left the Socialist Party owing to its opposition to World War I and thereafter participated in other liberal political organizations, including the Committee of 48 and his own group, the National Public Ownership League. Biography Early years = Carl D. Thompson was born on March 24, 1870, in Berlin, Michigan, a small town on the shore of Lake Erie in the southeastern corner of the state. He graduated from Gates College in Nebraska in 1895, from the Chicago Theological Seminary in 1898; and earned an MA degree from Chicago University in 1900. From 1891 through 1900, Thompson was employed as a minister of various Congregationalist churches. In 1900 he was minister of the Prospect Street Congregational Church in Elgin, Illinois, and in regular contact with Christian Socialist J. Stitt Wilson.Social Crusader, May 1900, 2 On January 1, 1901 he resigned from the pastorate of the Prospect Street Church and established a new Church of the Social Conscience.Social Crusader, February 1901, 5 – 6 =Political career= Cover of Thompson's first pamphlet, published in 1900. In September 1901 Thompson moved west to join J. Stitt Wilson's new \\"Social Crusade\\", a group of five ministers and former ministers who evangelized for socialism throughout California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado.The Challenge (Wilshire's Magazine) July 31, 1901; Los Angeles Herald, November 3, 1901 The socially-aware Thompson was a convert to Christian Socialism and a devotee of Victor L. Berger's Social Democratic Party of America. He worked as a State Organizer for the SDP of Wisconsin from 1898 until the merger of that organization at the 1901 Unity Convention which established the Socialist Party of America. Thompson was elected, to the Wisconsin State Assembly, as a Social Democrat (Socialist) in 1906 for the 12th Milwaukee County district, with 1,648 votes against 1,545 for the incumbent, Republican August Dietrich and 1010 for Democratic nominees Adam Muth. He was assigned to the standing committees on transportation and on third readings.Beck, J. D., ed. The blue book of the state of Wisconsin Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1907; pp. 628, 645, 646 In 1908, he was unseated in turn by Republican Carl Busacker, with 2,047 votes for Busacker, 1,956 for Thompson, 1,839 for Democrat George Schaefer, and 100 for Prohibitionist Benjamin C. Hughes.Beck, J. D., ed. The blue book of the state of Wisconsin Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1909; p. 553 During the 1908 United States presidential election he was nominated by Victor L. Berger for the Socialist presidential nomination, but it was given to Eugene V. Debs again. Thompson was a member of the Socialist Party's National Committee, representing Wisconsin. On June 19, 1912, Thompson was given the nomination of the Social Democratic Party, the Wisconsin state Socialist Party retained its historic name, for Governor of Wisconsin, coming in third in a five-way race with 8.74% of the vote, far more than the 3.05% margin of victory of Republican victor Francis E. McGovern.The Wisconsin blue book Madison: Democrat Printing Co., State Printer, 1913; p. 271 In 1914, Thompson moved to Illinois to work for the Socialist Party National Office as head of its Information Department, a post which he retained until the abolition of the position by the National Committee in 1915. Thompson also ran as the SPA's candidate for US Congress from Illinois's 7th congressional district against incumbent Democrat Frank Buchanan in 1914. Buchanan won with only 39.3% of the vote, to 35.4% for Republican Niels Juul (who would unseat Buchanan in 1916), 13.5% for Thompson, and 11.8% for Bull Moose Progressive Charles S. Stewart.\\"United States > Illinois > IL - District 07 11/3/1914\\" ourcampaigns.com Upon termination of the SPA's Information Department, he remained in Illinois and went to work as head of the party's National Lecture Bureau. In 1916, Thompson ran a tightly fought campaign against former United Mine Workers Union official Adolph Germer for the position of National Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party. Germer was regarded as the more radical of the two candidates and the result was close, with bloc voting by the various branches of the party's foreign language federations largely credited for providing the German-born Germer's margin of victory. During the 1916 United States elections he was the campaign managers of the Socialist Party's national campaign. =Post-World War I activity= After American entry into World War I in the spring of 1917, Thompson lent his support to Wilson's war effort. Along with other pro-war Socialists like John Spargo, Allan L. Benson, and William Ghent, Thompson worked throughout 1918 to attempt to cause the Socialist Party to annul what he described as the \\"illegal and impossible phraseology\\" of the party's 1917 St. Louis platform. Instead, Thompson urged that the party restate its position on the war, giving full support to Woodrow Wilson's purported \\"war to save the world for democracy\\" and explicitly recognizing that only force of arms was a sufficient means to defeat German militarism.Carl D. Thompson, \\"Here Are the Reasons Why There Is Urgent Need for Early Restatement on War Issue,\\" in The New Appeal (Girard, KS), no. 1,175 (June 8, 1918), pg. 2. Although Thompson indicated his belief that an \\"overwhelming majority\\" of the SPA's rank and file supported such a change, the Illinois state convention held May 3–4, 1918, seems to have demonstrated otherwise, with the defiantly antimilitarist St. Louis platform being upheld by \\"something like two to one\\" after \\"vigorous debate\\" — in Thompson's own estimation. As this political situation became clear in the summer of 1918, Thompson and his co-thinkers on the Socialist Party's right wing admitted defeat and left the ranks of the organization. After leaving the SPA, Thompson became involved in the activities of the liberal organization known as the Committee of 48, signing the call for the founding conference to organize the group.The Committee of Forty-Eight: For a Conference of Americans Who are Equally Opposed to Reaction and Violent Revolution: Its Purposes — And the Reasons for It. New York: The Committee of Forty-Eight, n.d. [1919]; pg. 7. After that organization fizzled in 1920 Thompson went on to establish an organization of his own, the National Public Ownership League, for which he served as National Secretary. This rather obscure organization seems to have continued at least through the middle-1930s. =Death and legacy= Shortly after moving to Lincoln, Nebraska Thompson died on July 3, 1949 at age 79.Death certificate for Carl Dean Thompson, Nebraska Department of Health, file #007073 FootnotesWorks * The Principles and Program of Socialism.

Stone is an American author, philosopher, and theologian. He is best known for helping to develop the religious movement of Religious Naturalism. Stone is on the Adjunct Faculty of Meadville Lombard Theological School; is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at William Rainey Harper College; is in Preliminary Fellowship with the Unitarian Universalist Association; and is a member of the Highlands Institute of American Religious and Philosophical Thought (HIARPT) and the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science (IRAS). Biography Stone grew up in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the son of a Protestant pastor. Though his family was of modest means he had access to a broad range of books. His father taught him respect for other religions early on. He was educated in the aesthetic and moral dimensions of church life. Instead of oppressive moralism, he was given a vision of moral integrity, service and a sense of the numinous. At the age of sixteen he left home, an early entrant to the University of Chicago. After a year of graduate studies, he transferred to Andover Newton Theological School outside of Boston, MA. His Mdiv thesis was done there on Paul Tillich’s Concept of God as the Ground of Being. He then continued his graduate training at the University of Chicago Divinity School, completing his doctorate there in 1973. His doctorate thesis was done on The Secular Experiences OF Transcendence: The Contributions of Bernard Meland, H. Richard Niebuhr and Paul Tillich. During this time he served as pastor at three Congregational and United Church of Christ churches. He helped organize the Danville Council on Human Relations which is said to have become the seed bed for the first Head Start program to receive funding. He went on to teach religion, philosophy, ethics and racism in America at Kendall College, William Rainey Harper College and later at the Meadville Theological School. Over these years he developed a strong environmentalism. In 2002, Stone wrote: :Lets get religious for a minute. What if the earth and its creatures were sacred? The sacred we treat with overriding care. What if the earth and our sibling creatures were sacred, either inherently sacred, or because they have a derivative sacredness as creatures of God... I would say that my enlightenment involves finding out that I am of the earth, earthly. The continuing task is to find out what this means and to live by it. Stone has moved from liberal Protestantism through a flirtation with neo-orthodoxy to a more serious wrestling with Paul Tillich and finally to a Religious Naturalism shaped by Henry Nelson Wieman, Bernard Meland and John Dewey. Religious Naturalism Stone's latest work,Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative, looks at the history and revival of Religious Naturalism, a 1940s option in religious thinking. It seeks to explore, develop and encourage spiritual ways of responding to the world on a completely naturalistic basis without a supreme supernatural being. Stone traces its history and analyzes some of the issues dividing Religious Naturalists. He includes analysis of nearly fifty distinguished philosophers, theologians, scientists, and figures in art and literature, both living and dead. They range from Ursula Goodenough, Gordon D. Kaufman, William Dean, Thomas Berry and Gary Snyder to Jan Christiaan Smuts, William Bernhardt, Gregory Bateson and Sharon Welch. His history includes its birth from George Santayana to modern contributors such as Henry Nelson Wieman, Loyal Rue and Chet Raymo. He briefly explores Religious Naturalism in literature and art. Contested issues are discussed including whether Nature's power or goodness is the focus of attention and also on the appropriateness of using the term God. Mary Doak, author of Reclaiming Narrative for Public Theology says of it: > This is a timely contribution to contemporary theology. I know of no other > book that provides such a clear yet nuanced account of the origins, > development, and contemporary forms of religious naturalism. Stone's > achievement ensures that religious naturalism will again be a major > contender in theological debates The individual perspectives on Religious Naturalism of Loyal Rue, Donald A. Crosby, Ursula Goodenough and Stone are discussed by Michael Hogue in his 2010 book The Promise of Religious Naturalism.The Promise of Religious Naturalism - Michael Hogue, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., Sept.16, 2010, WorksMajor publications= * Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative, State University of New York Press, December 2008 * The Chicago School of Theology, 2 Vols, The Edwin Mellen Press, 1996, co- edited and wrote Preface. * The Minimalist Vision of Transcendence: A Naturalist Philosophy of Religion, SUNY Press, 1992. * =Major articles=  * ReferencesExternal links * The Journal of Liberal Religion * What is Religious Naturalism? * Best of UU *Report on Religious Naturalism Today Category:American academics Category:Religious naturalists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jerome A. Stone"},{"id":"20907646","text":" Pre 1970s: Beginnings  The Padres adopted their name from the Pacific Coast League team which arrived in San Diego in 1936. That minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by then-18-year-old San Diegan Ted Williams. The team's name, Spanish for \\"fathers\\", refers to the Spanish Franciscan friars who founded San Diego in 1769. Prior to moving to the new stadium in another part of Mission Valley, the Padres played at Westgate Park, located where Fashion Valley currently is located. In 1969, the San Diego Padres joined the ranks of Major League Baseball as one of four new expansion teams, along with the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals), the Kansas City Royals and the Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers). Their original owner was C. Arnholt Smith, a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the PCL Padres whose interests included banking, tuna fishing, hotels, real estate and an airline. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman, Doc Mattei, and Buzzie Bavasi as well as a new playing field, the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the NL West, losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger Nate Colbert, an expansion draftee from the Houston Astros and still (as of 2015) the Padres' career leader in home runs. =Washington Stars= Before the 1974 season began, the Padres were on the verge of being sold to Joseph Danzansky, who was planning to move the franchise to Washington, D.C. in time for the upcoming season. New uniforms were designed for the team, which was planning to be renamed to the Washington Stars. Given the uncertain status of the Padres, Topps printed two sets of baseball cards for the team, splitting production between one set with \\"San Diego\\" and \\"Padres\\" as banners, and another with \\"Washington\\" and \\"Nat'l Lea\\" (National League). However, the sale to Danzansky became tied up in lawsuits, and Smith instead sold the team to McDonald's co-founder Ray Kroc for $12 million, saving baseball in San Diego.  1970s: Winfield, Jones, Fingers and Ozzie  San Diego Padres Cap (1974–1984) Ray Kroc owned the team from 1974 until his death in 1984 In his first home game as the Padres' new owner in 1974, Ray Kroc grabbed the public address system microphone and apologized to fans for the poor performance of the team, saying, \\"I have never seen such stupid ballplaying in my life.\\" At the same time, a streaker raced across the field, eluding security personnel. Kroc shouted, \\"Throw him in jail!\\" The following season, 1975, would be the first season that the Padres would not finish in the National League West cellar (finishing fourth), and brought the promise of an owner who would make the necessary changes to the organization. Nate Colbert is one of two major-league baseball players (Stan Musial is the other) to have hit five home runs in a doubleheader, a feat he accomplished as a Padre. He collected 13 RBIs in that doubleheader, still a major league record. Although the Padres continued to struggle after Colbert's departure via trade to the Detroit Tigers in 1974, they did feature star outfielder Dave Winfield, who came to the Padres in 1973 from the University of Minnesota without having played a single game in the minor leagues. Winfield was also drafted by the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association and the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association. Winfield took over where Colbert left off, starring in the Padres outfield from 1973 until 1980, when he joined the New York Yankees. In seven seasons, Winfield played in 1,117 games for San Diego and collected 1,134 hits, 154 home runs and drove in 626 runs. But most importantly, he helped the team out of the National League West basement for the first time in 1975, under the guidance of manager John McNamara, who took over the club at the start of the 1974 season. Winfield's emergence as a legitimate star coincided with the turnaround of a promising young left-handed pitcher named Randy Jones, who had suffered through 22 losses in 1974. Jones became the first San Diego pitcher to win 20 games in 1975, going 20–12 in 37 outings as the Padres finished in fourth place with a 71–91 record, 37 games behind the Cincinnati Reds. Jones won 22 games in 1976, winning the Cy Young Award in the process, another franchise first. The club set a new high with 73 wins, but fell to fifth place. Jones slipped to 6–12 in 1977, and not even the acquisition of Rollie Fingers could help the Padres escape the bottom half of the division. Only Winfield and fellow outfielder George Hendrick cracked the 20-homer barrier, and the pitching staff was filled with a group of unknowns and youngsters, few of whom would enjoy much success at the major league level. The 1978 season brought hope to baseball fans in San Diego, thanks to the arrival a young shortstop named Ozzie Smith, who arrived on the scene and turned the baseball world on its ears with an acrobatic style that redefined how the position should be played in the field. The Padres hosted the All-Star Game that summer. The National League won the contest 7–3 thanks to an MVP performance by Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Steve Garvey, who would play a crucial role for San Diego in the not-too-distant future. Winfield and Fingers represented the team at the game, but conspicuously absent was starting pitcher Gaylord Perry, who joined the Padres after spending three years with the Texas Rangers. At 39 years of age and coming off a 15–14 season with Texas, little was expected of him. All Perry did that summer was post a 21–6 record and a 2.73 earned run average, edging Montreal's Ross Grimsley to earn the Padres' second Cy Young Award in three seasons. San Diego also picked up another first that summer, compiling an 84–78 mark for manager Roger Craig, the only time in 10 seasons the team finished a season with a winning percentage above .500. The good times did not last, as the Padres closed out the decade with another losing season in 1979, a 68–93 record that cost Craig his job. Winfield was the lone bright spot, leading the National League with 118 RBIs. The good times continued to fade out as Winfield signed a 10-year contract with the New York Yankees after the 1980 season.  1984: The first pennant  The 1984 season began with a shock: Ray Kroc died of heart disease on January 14. Ownership of the team passed to his third wife, Joan Kroc. The team would wear Ray's initials, \\"RAK\\" on their jersey's left sleeve during the entire season, as well as the 1985 and 1986 seasons. Fortunately, happier times were ahead for the team. The Padres finished at 92–70 in 1984 and won the National League West championship, despite having no players with 100-RBI and only two batters with 20-HR. They were managed by Dick Williams and had an offense that featured veterans Steve Garvey, Garry Templeton, Graig Nettles, Alan Wiggins as well as Hall-of-Famer Tony Gwynn, who captured his first of what would be eight National League batting championships that year (he would also win in 1987–89 and from 1994–97; Gwynn shares the National League record with Honus Wagner). Gwynn, who also would win five National League Gold Gloves during his career, joined the Padres in 1982 following starring roles in both baseball and basketball at San Diego State University (he still holds the school record for career basketball assists), and after having been selected in the previous year by both the Padres in the baseball draft and by the then San Diego Clippers in the National Basketball Association draft. The Padres pitching staff in 1984 featured Eric Show (15–9), Ed Whitson (14–8), Mark Thurmond (14–8), Tim Lollar (11–13), and Rich \\"Goose\\" Gossage as their closer (10–6, 2.90 ERA and 25 saves).San Diego Padres 1984 Baseball-Reference.com Cub-Busters T-shirts were popular with Padres fans in 1984 postseason. In the 1984 NLCS, the Padres faced the NL East champion Chicago Cubs, who were making their first post-season appearance since 1945 and featured NL Most Valuable Player Ryne Sandberg and Cy Young Award winner Rick Sutcliffe. The Cubs would win the first two games at Wrigley Field, and were less than two innings away from a series sweep when their luck changed. The Padres swept the final three games at then San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium (the highlight arguably being Steve Garvey's dramatic, game-winning home run off of Lee Smith in Game 4) to win the 1984 National League pennant.Baseball-Reference.com 1984 NLCS Gossage, a former New York Yankee, said the San Diego crowd at Game 3 was \\"the loudest crowd I've ever heard anywhere.\\" Gwynn agreed as well. Jack Murphy Stadium played \\"Cub-Busters\\", a parody of the theme song from the 1984 movie Ghostbusters. Cub-Busters T-shirts inspired from the movie were popular attire for Padres fans. In the 1984 World Series, the Padres faced the powerful Detroit Tigers, who steamrolled through the regular season with 104 victories (and had started out with a 35–5 record, the best ever through the first 40 games). The Tigers were managed by Sparky Anderson and featured shortstop and native San Diegan Alan Trammell and outfielder Kirk Gibson, along with Lance Parrish and DH Darrell Evans. The pitching staff was bolstered by ace Jack Morris (19–11, 3.60 ERA), Dan Petry (18–8), Milt Wilcox (17–8), and closer Willie Hernández (9–3, 1.92 ERA with 32 saves).Detroit Tigers 1984 season Baseball-Reference.com Jack Morris would win games 1 and 4 and the Tigers would go on to win the Series 4-games-to-1.1984 World Series stats Baseball- Reference.com Reporter Barry Bloom of MLB.com wrote in 2011 that \\"the postseason in ’84 is still the most exciting week of Major League Baseball ever played in San Diego.\\"  1985–95: Tough times following a pennant  After the Padres won the pennant in 1984, they had some tough times. Tony Gwynn continued to win batting titles (including batting .394 in 1994). The Padres would come close in 1985. They would field eight All-Stars (manager Dick Williams, Tony Gwynn, Graig Nettles, Rich Gossage, Terry Kennedy, Garry Templeton, Steve Garvey, and LaMarr Hoyt) at the 1985 All-Star Game in Minnesota. However, they collapsed at the end of the season, finishing tied for third with the Houston Astros behind the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds. Williams was let go as manager just before 1986 spring training. His record with the Padres was 337–311 over four seasons. As of 2011, he was the only manager in the team's history without a losing season. His difficulties with the Padres stemmed from a power struggle with team president Ballard Smith and general manager Jack McKeon. Late in the 1986 season, Gossage was suspended and then reinstated with a $25,000 fine for behavior not in the best interest of the team. Gossage said that Smith \\"wants choirboys and not winning players\\" and that Smith \\"just listens to what Mom says\\", a reference to Padres owner Kroc, Smith's mother-in-law. Gossage also said Kroc was \\"poisoning the world with her cheeseburgers.\\" He later apologized to McDonald's, which Gossage said his family would continue to frequent. Jack Murphy Stadium in 1990; the Padres played there from 1969 through 2003. In 1987, rookie catcher Benito Santiago hit in 34 straight games, earning him the NL Rookie of the Year Award. However, the Padres finished dead last in 1987, thanks to the managing of the tempestuous Larry Bowa. The next season, rookie second baseman Roberto Alomar would make his debut, forming a double play combination with veteran shortstop Garry Templeton. During the 1988 season, Bowa was replaced by Jack McKeon and the Padres won 83 games, finishing in third place. Team president Chub Feeney resigned after giving the finger to fans carrying a sign reading \\"SCRUB CHUB\\" on Fan Appreciation Night. In 1989, the Padres finished 89–73 thanks to Cy Young Award-winning closer Mark Davis. Between 1989 and 1990, friction dominated the Padres' clubhouse as Tony Gwynn had constant shouting matches with slugger Jack Clark. But as the franchise player, Gwynn prevailed as Clark finished his career with the Red Sox. Midway through the 1990 season, Joan Kroc wanted to sell the team, but she wanted a commitment to San Diego. So, Kroc sold the team to television producer Tom Werner. Just under six weeks into his new ownership role, Werner attempted to cross-promote the team with one of his television series in between games of a twi-night doubleheader versus the Cincinnati Reds at Jack Murphy Stadium on July 25, 1990. On an evening billed as Working Women's Night at the ballpark, he had invited Roseanne Barr, the eponymous star of one of his sitcoms, to perform The Star- Spangled Banner. She comically sang the national anthem with a loud, screechy voice. After finishing her rendition, she grabbed her crotch and spat at the ground in an attempt to parody baseball players. The publicity stunt was met with condemnation from baseball fans, sportswriters, and even the President, some of whom called it either the \\"Barr-Mangled Banner\\" or the \\"Barr-Strangled Banner.\\"Center, Bill. \\"The ballpark chronicles: 35 seasons with the Padres–Chapter 5: 'Barr-Strangled Banner,'\\" The San Diego Union-Tribune, Thursday, September 25, 2003.Distel, Dave. \\"Padres' Werner to Blame for Roseanne's 'Barr-Mangled Banner,'\\" Los Angeles Times, Saturday, July 28, 1990. Under Werner, the old brown that remained in Padres uniforms since their inception were supplanted by navy blue, a nod to the vintage 1940s PCL franchise colors. A trade was also made with the Toronto Blue Jays where Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar were traded for Fred McGriff and Tony Fernández. In 1992, the Padres lineup featured the \\"Four Tops\\": Gary Sheffield, Fred McGriff, Tony Fernández, and Tony Gwynn. However, Fernandez would go to the New York Mets, McGriff went to the division-winning Atlanta Braves, and Sheffield would go to the expansion Florida Marlins. Although extremely unpopular at the time, it was the Sheffield trade that brought in pitcher Trevor Hoffman, who was virtually unknown to Padres fans. While Sheffield led Florida to a World Championship in 1997, Hoffman would be the next franchise player behind Dave Winfield and Tony Gwynn. The Padres would finish dead last in the strike-shortened 1994 season, but Gwynn hit .394 that year (the most since Ted Williams hit over .400 in 1941) and pitcher Andy Benes led the NL in strikeouts. After that season, the Padres made a mega-trade with Houston reeling in Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley, and others. In November 1995, Kevin Towers was promoted from scouting director to general manager. 1996–97: Building a winner In 1996, under new owner John Moores (a software tycoon who purchased controlling ownership in the team in 1994 from Tom Werner, who subsequently formed a syndicate that purchased the Boston Red Sox) and team president Larry Lucchino, and with a team managed by former Padres catcher Bruce Bochy (a member of the 1984 NL championship squad), the team won the NL West in an exciting race, sweeping the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium in the final series of the regular season. The '96 team featured Gwynn, who won his seventh National League batting championship, National League MVP Ken Caminiti, premier leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson, pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, first baseman Wally Joyner and outfielder Steve Finley. The Padres had led the NL West early in the season only to falter in June, but came back in July and battled the Dodgers the rest of the way. However, they were defeated in the National League Division Series by the Tony La Russa-led St. Louis Cardinals, 3 games to 0. The Padres suffered an off-year in 1997, plagued by a pitching slump. The one silver lining was Tony Gwynn's eighth and final National League batting title, won in the final days of the season after a down-to-the wire duel with the Colorado Rockies' Larry Walker. Walker barely missed becoming the first Triple Crown winner in baseball since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.  1998: The second pennant  Padres cap logo (1998–2003) In 1998, Henderson and Valenzuela were gone, but newly acquired (from the 1997 World Series champion Florida Marlins) pitcher Kevin Brown had a sensational year (his only one with the Padres) and outfielder/slugger Greg Vaughn hit 50 home runs (overlooked in that season of the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa race). Managed by Bruce Bochy and aided by the talents of players such as Tony Gwynn, Ken Caminiti, Wally Joyner, Steve Finley, pitcher Andy Ashby and premier closer Trevor Hoffman (4–2, 1.48 ERA and 53 saves), the Padres had their best year in history, finishing 98–64 and winning the NL West division crown.San Diego Padres 1998 season stats Baseball-Reference.com In the next year, the team owners would make a bid to have the city of San Diego construct a new stadium for the Padres. To guarantee that the city fathers would vote in the affirmative, the Padres recruited a record number of players for the 1998 season, most of whom would become free agents in 1999. Therefore, they would have the best incentive to have a successful season, to get the best contracts possible (potentially with other teams), in 1999. This gambit was completely successful: the Padres had a record season, the new ballpark was approved, most of the stars of 1998 left, and the team would have a lackluster year in 1999. The Padres defeated the Houston Astros in the 1998 NLDS, 3 games to 1, behind solid pitching by Brown and Hoffman, and home runs by Greg Vaughn, Wally Joyner and Jim Leyritz (who homered in 3 of the 4 games).1998 NLDS stats Baseball-Reference.com In the 1998 NLCS, the Padres faced the Atlanta Braves, who had won the National League East with an astonishing 106–56 record. The offense was paced by talent such as Andrés Galarraga, Chipper Jones, Andruw Jones and Javy López. Their pitching staff had the perennial big-3 of Greg Maddux (18–9, 2.22 ERA), Tom Glavine (20–6, 2.47 ERA), and John Smoltz (17–3, 2.90 ERA), as well as Kevin Millwood (17–8, 4.08 ERA) and Denny Neagle (16–11, 3.55 ERA). However, it was the Padres that would prevail, 4 games to 2, with ace Kevin Brown pitching a shutout in game 2 (winning 3–0).1998 NLDS Baseball- Reference.com Steve Finley caught a pop fly for the final out, as the Padres clinched the series. In the 1998 World Series the Padres faced the powerhouse New York Yankees, who had steamrolled through the season with a 114–48 record and drew acclaim as one their greatest teams of all time. There was no offensive player with more than 30 home runs, in contrast to the teams of the 1920s, or 1950s, but they had four players with 24+ and eight with 17+. Yankee pitching had been paced by David Cone (20–7, 3.55), Andy Pettitte (16–11, 4.24), David Wells (18–4, 3.49), Hideki Irabu (13–9, 4.06) and Orlando Hernández (12–4, 3.13). Mariano Rivera, their closer, was excellent once again (3–0, 1.91 ERA with 36 saves).New York Yankees 1998 season stats Baseball- Reference.com The Yankees swept the Padres in four games. Mariano Rivera closed out 3 of the 4 games. One of the few bright spots of the series for the Padres was a home run by Tony Gwynn, in Game 1, that hit the facing of the right-field upper deck at Yankee Stadium and put the Padres ahead briefly, 5–2. But the Yankees would score 7 runs in the 7th inning en route to a 9–6 victory.1998 World Series Baseball-Reference.com This World Series loss by the Padres was the only time during the Yankees' dynasty of the 1990s that did not revive the rivalry between the New York Mets and the Atlanta Braves. Three of the four Yankees championships during their dynasty came against either team ( and against Atlanta, against New York). 1999–2003: Tough times following a pennant, again Entering the 1999 season, some instrumental players to the 1998 World Series team were gone. Brown, a free agent, signed the biggest contract in baseball history with the Dodgers. Finley, a free agent, signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Caminiti, a free agent went to the Houston Astros. Vaughn and utilityman Mark Sweeney were traded to the Cincinnati Reds for left fielder Reggie Sanders, infielder Damian Jackson and pitching prospect Josh Harris. Starting pitcher Joey Hamilton was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitchers Woody Williams and Carlos Almanzar. The Padres opened their 1999 season in Monterrey, Mexico versus the Colorado Rockies. On August 6, 1999, Tony Gwynn got his 3,000th hit (a single) against the Montreal Expos at Olympic Stadium. On October 7, 2001, in a post-game ceremony at Qualcomm Stadium, Tony Gwynn made an emotional farewell to the team that had been his only major-league home. In the game played that day, Rickey Henderson, who in the meantime had rejoined the Padres, collected his 3,000th major-league base hit, a double. Gwynn struck his final major-league hit, also a double, in the previous game. He was the head coach of the San Diego State University Aztecs, his alma mater from 2003 to 2014. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on July 29, 2007. Gwynn died on June 16, 2014 of salivary gland cancer. Also in 2001, Dave Winfield became the first player to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a Padre. 2004–present: Petco Park and a new era 2004: Petco Park opens = After five straight losing seasons in Qualcomm Stadium (1999–2003), the Padres moved into newly built Petco Park. Petco Park is situated in downtown near San Diego's Gaslamp District, the main entrance located just two blocks from the downtown terminal of the San Diego Trolley light-rail system. With new amenities and a revitalization of the downtown neighborhood, fan interest renewed. Modeled after recent successes in downtown ballpark building (such as San Francisco's Oracle Park), and incorporating San Diego history in the form of the preservation of the facade of the historic Western Metals Company building (now the left-field corner, the corner of the building substituting for the left field foul pole), the new Petco Park is a sharp contrast to their previous home at Qualcomm (Jack Murphy) Stadium which was a cookie-cutter type football-baseball facility located in an outer, mostly commercial-industrial, area of the city near an interstate interchange. With the ocean air prevalent and a sharp, clean park to play in, the Padres began to win again. The new stadium also acquired a reputation as a pitchers' park, with notable complaints from some of the Padres batters themselves (deep center field and evenings with dense foggy air). The Padres finished the 2004 season with an 87–75 record, good enough for 3rd in the NL West. The team somewhat rebranded itself going into the 2004 season, with new colors (navy blue and sand brown), new uniforms and a new advertising slogan, \\"Play Downtown\\", referring to the near-downtown location of the new ballpark. One of the bricks at the center plaza of Petco Park was secretly purchased by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights organization that has protested the breeding and purchasing of the animals sold at Petco stores. The brick reads, \\"Break out your cold ones. Toast the Padres. Enjoy this champion organization.\\" The first letter of each word is really an acrostic urging people to boycott the stores. =2005: The worst division winner ever= In 2005, the Western Division Champion Padres finished with the lowest-ever winning percentage for a division champion (or for that matter, a postseason qualifier) in a non-strike season, 82–80. Three teams in the Eastern Division finished with better records than San Diego but failed to qualify for the playoffs, including second-place Philadelphia, which won 88 games and all six of its contests with the Padres. There had been some speculation that the Padres would be the first team in history to win a division and finish below .500, but their victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 30 gave them their 81st victory. In the 2005 NLDS, the reigning National League champion St. Louis Cardinals, who finished the season with the majors' best record, swept the Padres in three consecutive games. Thus the Padres finished the season with an overall regular-and-post-season record of 82–83, the first post-season qualifier in a normal-length season to lose more games than it won overall. The 2005 Padres featured bright spots, however, including ace pitcher Jake Peavy, the NL strikeout leader, and closer Trevor Hoffman, who claimed his 400th save. = 2006: Another division title = The Padres started April 2006 with a 9–15 record and were stuck in the cellar of the NL West. However, after going 19–10 in May, the club moved into first place in the division. Closer Trevor Hoffman was elected to the 2006 MLB All- Star Game in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, threw one inning in that game and got the loss. On September 24 (the last home game of the regular season), Hoffman became the all-time saves leader when he recorded his 479th career save, breaking Lee Smith's record of 478 (Hoffman's career total as of the end of the season was 482). Hoffman's 2006 campaign (2.14 ERA, 46 saves in 51 opportunities through 65 games pitched) was one of his best. The 2006 Padres would attribute their success largely to the team's pitching staff. Their ERA was 3.87, first in the NL and trailing only the Detroit Tigers in all of MLB. On September 30, 2006, the Padres clinched a playoff berth with a 3–1 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. In the final game of the season, the Padres defeated the Diamondbacks 7–6 to win back to back division titles for the first time in team history (they were tied with the Dodgers for the division title, but because of winning the season series against them, the division title went to them and the wild card went to the Dodgers). The final out of the final game of the 2006 regular season — confirming the Padres as Division champions — was a highly unusual play. With Trevor Hoffman pitching the 9th, 2 out, Diamondback Chris Young was on first. Alberto Callaspo hit a grounder past first. Second baseman Josh Barfield fielded and threw wildly to first, forcing Gonzalez to come off the bag. However, Gonzalez then threw to Khalil Greene at second, beating but not tagging Young. Second base umpire Larry Poncino initially called safe because of the no-tag, but Padres manager Bruce Bochy successfully argued that the force play at second did not need a tag to be declared out. The game, and the season, ended with a changed call. TV replay, however, clearly showed that Greene was off the bag as well, so the original call may have been correct. This call, understandably, was greeted by a long and loud chorus of boos by the Diamondbacks fans who packed Chase Field to bid farewell to Luis Gonzalez. Only 53 teams in the modern era have posted sub-.500 records in April and survived to make the postseason. The San Diego Padres achieved the feat in both 2005 and 2006. The Padres opened the 2006 National League Division Series at home against the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday, October 3, 2006. After losing the first two games at home (5–1 and 2–0 respectively), they won game 3 at Busch Stadium 3–1, but were eliminated with a 6–2 loss in Game 4, when the Cardinals, who trailed 2–0 before their first at-bat, scored six unanswered runs (two in the first, and four in the sixth) for the win. After the end of the 2006 season, the Padres had an overall post-season record of 12–22, losing 10 of their last 11 games since winning the National League pennant in 1998. One key offseason trade between the San Diego Padres' General Manager, Kevin Towers, and the Texas Rangers' General Manager, Jon Daniels, would prove to have a dramatic impact on their 2006 season. The Padres dealt starting pitcher Adam Eaton, middle reliever Akinori Otsuka, and minor-league catcher Billy Killian in exchange for starting pitcher Chris Young, left fielder Terrmel Sledge, and first baseman Adrián González. González would take over the everyday duties at first base, batting .304 with a club-leading 24 home runs and 82 RBI in his first year as a full-time starter. Sledge would hit .229 in limited major league action. Chris Young proved to be the real story, however, as he would go 11–5 with a 3.46 ERA (6th best in the National League) and allowed just 6.72 hits per 9 innings pitched – best in the majors. 2006 also ended up being the last year of Bruce Bochy's tenure as the manager of the Padres, taking the managerial position for their divisional rivals, the San Francisco Giants. He was replaced by Bud Black, a San Diego State University alumni and former pitching coach of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. = 2007: Falling short = On Sunday, April 1, 2007, Major League Baseball's 2007 Opening Night, the Padres announced that they had agreed to terms on a four-year contract with 1B Adrián González, keeping him in San Diego until 2010 with a club option for 2011. Prior to this contract agreement the Padres had offered to renew González's contract during the offseason at $380,500, only $500 over the league minimum for the 2007 season. The Padres' 2007 season began April 3 in an away game against the San Francisco Giants, winning it 7–0 in front of a capacity crowd of 42,773 at AT&T; Park, defeating $126 million staff-ace Barry Zito in his Giants debut. The Padres bullpen continued to be the team's strength as in recent years, opening the season with 28 scoreless innings, a Major League record to start a season. At the start of the season the Padres starting rotation order was as follows: Jake Peavy, Chris Young, Clay Hensley (injured, replaced by Justin Germano), Greg Maddux, David Wells. On June 4, 2007, Jake Peavy was named NL Pitcher of the Month after going 4–0 with a 0.79 ERA in May. The next day, Trevor Hoffman was named the \\"DHL Presents the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Month Award\\" for May 2007. The award recognizes the most outstanding relief pitcher during each month of the regular season. On June 6, 2007, Trevor Hoffman became the first pitcher in major league history to record 500 saves, 498 of them coming as a Padre (the first 2 were as a Florida Marlin). On September 23, 2007, Milton Bradley tore his right ACL while being restrained by Padres manager Bud Black during an altercation with first base umpire Mike Winters. Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters said that Bradley had tossed his bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After Bradley reached first base, he questioned Winters about the alleged bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley and Padres first base coach Bobby Meacham, Winters used a profanity towards Bradley. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground resulting in the injury. He missed the last week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres relinquished their wild card lead, ultimately losing to the eventual N.L. Champion Colorado Rockies in a one-game playoff.YouTube – Milton Bradley Suicide Bombs His Teams The Padres ended the regular season in an 89–73 tie for the NL wild card with the Colorado Rockies. In a cruel piece of irony, on September 29, 2007, the Padres were within one out and one strike of clinching the National League Wild Card berth, but Tony Gwynn, Jr., son of the longtime Padres legend, tripled against Hoffman to tie the game. The Padres went on to lose that game, and the one that followed, even though the Milwaukee Brewers had been eliminated from the pennant race and had nothing left to play for. The Padres then met the Rockies on October 1, 2007 in Denver for a one-game playoff to decide the wild card winner. Despite having Jake Peavy start the game and bringing in Trevor Hoffman in the bottom of the 13th inning to try to hold an 8–6 lead, the Padres' season ended when the Rockies rallied to win 9–8. It ended on a controversial call on a sacrifice fly where many questioned whether Matt Holliday ever touched home plate, leaving Padre fans saying \\"Holliday never touched home!\\" The umpire of that game claimed that the catcher, Michael Barrett, was blocking the plate before he had possession of the ball. Therefore, Holiday was ruled safe. On November 15, Jake Peavy won the National League Cy Young Award by unanimous ballot. He was the fourth Padre to capture the pitching award. The Padres entered the 2007–08 offseason with a number of questions, including the ability of Trevor Hoffman to close games past his 40th birthday, the ongoing inability to hold runners on base (the Padres' caught-stealing ratio in 2007 was one of the worst in baseball history), two holes in the back of the starting rotation, and the possible departure of Mike Cameron to free agency. The two holes in the rotation were filled by former Dodger Randy Wolf and Mark Prior and the club dealt for Jim Edmonds to replace Cameron. Additionally, Milton Bradley was signed by the Texas Rangers. The Padres signed Mark Prior to a one-year deal in the off- season. Prior, a University of San Diego HS graduate (now Cathedral HS), joined a team that consisted of players that were also local prep stars, Brian Giles (Granite Hills HS), Adrián González (Eastlake HS), and Óscar Robles (Montgomery HS). Recent Padres teams had also included Dave Roberts (Rancho Buena Vista HS), David Wells (Point Loma HS), and Marcus Giles (Granite Hills HS). = 2008–2009: Struggles = The Padres started the 2008 campaign March 31, in San Diego against the Houston Astros, and won the series 3–1. 2007 All- Star Chris Young pitched in the second game of the season, a 2–1 win, and Trevor Hoffman, the game's all-time saves leader, wrapped up the ninth for the save. The Los Angeles Dodgers came into town and took two of three. 2007 Cy Young winner Jake Peavy picked up the only win during the Dodgers' series. At the end of the opening homestand, the Padres were 3–3. The Padres traveled to San Francisco, hoping to fatten up on former manager Bruce Bochy's Giants, but the now-Bondsless bay dwellers took two of three. In Los Angeles, the Padres won two of three, pushing their record back to .500. On April 17, 2008, during the series against the Colorado Rockies at Petco Park, the Padres played the longest game in team history, in terms of innings (22), losing 2–1. The game was the second longest in team history, in terms of time, played in 6 hours, 16 minutes; the game was a minute shorter than the longest game, in terms of time, played against the Houston Astros in 1980. Following that game, which sapped the team's bullpen strength, the Padres stumbled, dropping games at home, where they struggled to score runs, and on the road, where they committed uncharacteristic errors and failed to hold leads. Returning home after a humbling three-game sweep in Atlanta in early May, the Padres cut Jim Edmonds, the Cardinals castoff who had been brought in after the Padres failed to sign Mike Cameron to a new deal in the off-season. With former Indian Jody Gerut now in center, the Padres won the three-game weekend home series with the Rockies and motored to Chicago with the hopes of winning three of four to get the season back on track. Instead, the Cubs, with Jim Edmonds in center, won three of four and booted the Padres from the Windy City into an interleague series with the Mariners, their Peoria, Ariz. spring training neighbors. The Mariners used speed—and a late-inning burst of power from Adrián Beltré in one game—to win the series and shove the Padres deeper into their early-season hole. After sweeping the New York Mets in a four-game series that ended on June 8, the Padres climbed to 7 games back of first-place Arizona. The sweep put the Mets 7.5 games behind the first-place Philadelphia Phillies, sending the Padres and the Mets, expansion teams in the 1960s, in different directions. The Padres won two of three games in a series against the Dodgers at Petco Park. There was talk in San Diego that the Padres had a serious chance to get back in the race in a weak NL West. A road trip sent the Padres to play the Indians in Cleveland, where they lost two of the three games. During their final trip to Yankee Stadium, the site of Tony Gwynn's upperdeck World Series blast, the Padres were swept by the Yankees. They returned to Petco and dropped two of three to the Tigers. They were then swept by the Twins and Mariners. Returning to National League competition did not help much, as Padres lost two of three in Colorado to the Rockies. Powered by former Diamondbacks outfielder Scott Hairston, the Padres won two of three in Arizona. The team could not sustain the momentum however and they lost two of three to the Marlins at Petco Park. In the last series before the All-Star break, the Padres lost two of three to the Braves. Adrián González represented the Padres at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, going 1–3 with an RBI. González made a nice scoop on a throw from catcher Russell Martin during a tense moment late in the game but he struck out with a chance to drive in the go-ahead run late in the game. According to media reports, González was asked during an All-Star game media session what it would take for the Padres to make the playoffs. He said 30 wins. When the interviewer asked if he thought that was possible, González glared at the interviewer and did not answer the question. On July 17, the Padres traded former San Diego State player Tony Clark to the Diamondbacks for minor league pitcher Evan Scribner. Following the All-Star break, the Padres continued to struggle, getting swept in a four- game series in St. Louis and losing two of three in Cincinnati. A trip to Pittsburgh proved to be the tonic the team needed. The Padres won three of four in the Steel City and during the series the Pirates traded former Padre underachiever Xavier Nady to the Yankees for prospects. Back home, the Padres won the first game of the series against the division-leading Diamondbacks. The win gave Greg Maddux 351 career wins and he tipped his hat to the crowd when he left with a lead. Late in August, the team parted ways with Greg Maddux by trading him to the Los Angeles Dodgers. As this disastrous season started to come to a close, questions about the coaching staff started swirling like crazy. In mid-September, Hitting Coach Wally Joyner resigned due to the team's lackluster offense and a difference in philosophy with upper management (most notably, CEO Sandy Alderson). It seems that Joyner beat the Padres to the punch, as he was likely to be replaced at the end of the season. The team finished off a 63–99 season on September 28 with a 10–6 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, finishing 5th in the NL West, 21 games behind the division leader Los Angeles Dodgers. On September 29, the team renewed the contracts of Manager Bud Black, Pitching Coach Darren Balsley, Bullpen Coach Darrell Akerfelds, 3rd Base Coach Glenn Hoffman (brother of closer Trevor Hoffman) and 1st Base Coach Rick Renteria. Only Bench Coach Craig Colbert was not renewed and because of Wally Joyner's earlier resignation the team had no Hitting Coach to bring back. On October 10, the Padres offered Trevor Hoffman a $4 million salary for 2009 plus a $4 million club option in 2010 then on November 11 the Padres withdrew the $4 million offer to the all-time saves leader, making him a free agent. The Padres opened 2009 April 6 versus the rival Dodgers at home, losing 4–1 and splitting the four-game series. They then swept the Giants, also at home in three games. Then they took 2 of 3 from the Mets to ruin the first series at Citi Field. In that series, Jody Gerut became the first player in major league history to open a new ballpark with a leadoff home run. After the first three series, the Padres were tied with the Dodgers for first place at 7–3. After the hot start however, the Padres stumbled and were 25–25 as of May 31. Early in the season, the Padres acquired Tony Gwynn, Jr., son of franchise great Tony Gwynn, from the Milwaukee Brewers. San Diego finished 75–87, fourth in the NL West, only ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks. =2010–11: The Jed Hoyer era= Many preseason predictions picked the Padres in 2010 to finish the season in last place in the NL West. On August 25, however, the Padres were 76–49 and in first place with a game lead. A 10–game losing streak immediately followed. With a 3–0 loss on October 3, the final game of the season, the Padres were officially eliminated from playoff contention and the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants won the division. The Padres led the NL West for 148 days in 2010. Adrián González would have been in the last year of his contract in 2011, but the Padres were not going to meet González's open market value especially with Jeff Moorad's purchase of the Padres from John Moores not completing until around 2013. On December 6, 2010, González was traded to the Boston Red Sox for a package of right-handed pitcher Casey Kelly, first baseman Anthony Rizzo, outfielder Reymond Fuentes, and a player to be named later, later determined to be Eric Patterson.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101206&content;_id=16260572&vkey;=news_mlb&c;_id=mlbhttp://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101216&content;_id=16332932&vkey;=news_bos&c;_id=bos After the 2011 season, general manager Jed Hoyer left the Padres to join the Chicago Cubs.

He stepped down as CEO of the Padres later that month, but remained with the team as Vice-Chairman. Media outlets including U-T San Diego, Fox Sports, and Associated Press speculated that Moorad was short of the needed support of 22 MLB team owners to complete the purchase of the Padres. Moores declared that the entire team was up for sale again in April, citing the good opportunity in the market after the record $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers. In August, MLB approved Moores' $800 million sale of the Padres to a group led by beer distributor Ron Fowler that included four heirs to the O’Malley family, who owned the Dodgers for five decades. The sale completed on or before August 28, 2012. As much as $200 million of the sale price includes the team's 20-percent stake in Fox Sports San Diego. Members of the O'Malley family include Kevin and Brian O'Malley, who are the sons of former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley and grandsons of Walter O'Malley, the owner who moved the Dodgers west from Brooklyn after the 1957 season. Peter and Tom Seidler are the nephews of Peter O’Malley. Fowler was named the ownership group's executive chairman and was named the Padres representative in all league meetings. He was the first locally based control person of the team since founding owner C. Arnholdt Smith. The team would not post a winning record for the remainder of the decade. Bud Black was fired in the middle of the 2015 season and was replaced by Andy Green after the season. On February 21, 2019, the Padres signed Manny Machado to a record-breaking 10-year, $300 million contract. However, Machado was unable to prevent San Diego from finishing last in their division in 2019 as they finished with a 70–92 record. The Padres were one of four teams to never reach the postseason during the 2010s, the others being the White Sox, the Mariners, and the Marlins.

After decades of turbulent politics, in 1992 Congo completed a transition to multi-party democracy. Ending a long history of one- party Marxist rule, a specific agenda for this transition was laid out during Congo's national conference of 1991 and culminated in August 1992 with multi- party presidential elections. Sassou-Nguesso conceded defeat and Congo's new president, Professor Pascal Lissouba, was inaugurated on August 31, 1992. Congolese democracy experienced severe trials in 1993 and early 1994. The President dissolved the National Assembly in November 1992, calling for new elections in May 1993. The results of those elections sparked violent civil unrest in June and again in November. In February 1994 the decisions of an international board of arbiters were accepted by all parties, and the risk of large-scale insurrection subsided. However, Congo's democratic progress derailed in 1997. As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached, tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou camps mounted. The Congolese army, loyal to President Lissouba, attacked Sassou's compound in Brazzaville on June 5. While the Army said the operation was to search for arms, Sassou used the incident as a casus belli for armed insurrection, igniting a 4-month conflict that destroyed or damaged much of Brazzaville. Lissouba traveled throughout southern and central Africa in September, asking the governments of Rwanda, Uganda, and Namibia for assistance. Laurent Kabila, the new-President of the DRC, sent hundreds of troops into Brazzaville to fight on Lissouba's behalf. About 1,000 Angolan tanks, troops, and MiG fighter jets and arms donated by the French-government bolstered Sassou's rebels. Together these forces took Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire in the morning of 16 October. Lissouba fled the capital while his soldiers surrendered and citizens began looting. France had put its 600 citizens in Brazzaville, mostly oil workers, on alert for evacuation, but ultimately decided against the measure.Rebels, Backed by Angola, Take Brazzaville and Oil Port The New York Times. Soon thereafter, Sassou declared himself president and named a 33-member government. In January 1998 the Sassou regime held a National Forum for Reconciliation to determine the nature and duration of the transition period. The Forum, tightly controlled by the government, decided elections should be held in about 3 years, elected a transition advisory legislature, and announced that a constitutional convention would finalize a draft constitution. However, the eruption in late 1998 of fighting between Sassou's government forces and an armed opposition disrupted the transitional return to democracy. This new violence also closed the economically vital Brazzaville- Pointe-Noire railroad; caused great destruction and loss of life in southern Brazzaville and in the Pool, Bouenza, and Niari regions; and displaced hundreds of thousands of persons. However, in November and December 1999, the government signed agreements with representatives of many, though not all, of the rebel groups. The December accord, mediated by President Omar Bongo of Gabon, called for follow-on, inclusive political negotiations between the government and the opposition.

The same complex houses the Anavryta Experimental Gymnasium (students aged 13–15) as well. It was established in 1940, shortly before the beginning of the World War II, as the Anavryta Classical Lyceum.Syngros' Mansion is very close to the school (which would be just behind the building in the centre of the picture) History The former Anavryta Classical Lyceum was an elite Greek lyceum (originally a boys-only boarding school) that was established in 1940, shortly before Greece's entry into World War II, in order to provide education to the members of the Greek royal family and notable Athenian families. It was reestablished after the war in 1949. In 1957, Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, widow of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, died in Greece, having bequeathed her personal library to the Anavryta Lyceum. In 1971, the school was named a Lykeion Aristouhon which only admitted students who had distinguished themselves in other schools. After several educational reforms in Greece, the school lost its elitist character in 1976, but continued to have higher admissions standards until the end of the 1980s. The Anavryta Classical Lyceum was originally based on the educational principles of Kurt Hahn, and modelled on Hahn’s own creations: the Schule Schloss Salem and Gordonstoun. The effort to create an elite high school in Athens inspired by Hahn’s principles had originated from King George II of Greece following the tradition of the Greek royal family attending Hahn schools. The effort was supported by the Greek academic society mainly because of the strong relationship of Hahn’s theories with ancient Greek philosophy. The main goal of the lyceum was to focus on the pursuit of the Hahnian ideals and the study of Greek classics. The fate of the lyceum was closely tied with the Greek royal family, but the only king of Greece who actually graduated from the lyceum was Constantine II, in the class of 1958. The abolition of the monarchy in 1974, following a seven-year military junta, removed that association. Under circumstances that followed in the next years and especially in the 1980s it was increasingly difficult for a public school to maintain an elitist approach in Greece. Anavryta lost its exclusive character, but remained a school with a solid reputation for academic excellence. Eventually at the end of 1991-1992 the school was prohibited from setting absolutely any kind of admission standards and requirements. Thus the lyceum completely lost its original characteristics. The Anavryta experiment ended mainly because of the hostility that the democratic Greek governments have shown to what was considered to be the reminder of the previous regime and the complete transformation of Greek society in the decades that followed. Nevertheless, the importance of the lyceum and its educational role cannot be underestimated. The impressive alumni of the Classical lyceum shows distinguished members since generations of spiritual leaders, academics, spokesmen, businessmen, and other prominent members of the Greek society had graduated from the Classical lyceum in the decades following 1940. The Anavryta experiment did not end, however, because the merit-based approach was restored in 2013, when the Greek Government made it mandatory for students to pass written examinations. The students who performed best in this exam were selected to attend the school. The first examination in 2013 had nearly 250 students competing for a place. Buildings and facilities The complex is located in the Syngros forest. The building of the lyceum, though old, has a computers classroom, a Physics laboratory, a Chemistry and Biology laboratory, and a theatre. Outside the lyceum stands the billionaire Andreas Syngros' mansion (which is currently under repair), a theatre, the gymnasium, and many courts, used by both the gymnasium and the lyceum. The lyceum students have expressed their disapproval of the building, as it is old and needs repairing. In 2001-02 the gymnasium was repaired and this year (2008–09) the Sygros mansion is being repaired, something that implies that the lyceum is to be repaired too. Students The complex (the lyceum and the gymnasium put- together) has a number of 630 students approximately. The school now gets 3/4 of its students from graduates of the gymnasium, and the other 1/4 is selected with written examinations before the beginning of the school year. The school belongs to a group of schools, in which the Ministry of National Education chooses the teachers according to special standards, such as Doctorates, long- term experience in teaching and published papers or books.Criteria for teachers(greek) Lessons Most of the subjects are taught in Greek. There are some differences that the school has from other public lyceums in Greece. Students are free to choose from a variety of programmes (\\"subject groups of interest\\"), most of which carry out an excursion to another E.U. country. Students from abroad also visit the school. English is taught in levels ranging from 3 to 4, 4 being CPE level and 3 being CAE level.

In 1849 he produced an irreverent print called Dōke musha: Miyo no wakamochi (\\"Funny Warriors—Our Ruler's New Year's Rice Cakes\\"), which depicts Oda Nobunaga, Akechi Mitsuhide, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi making mochi rice cakes for the shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu. A poem by Sawaya Kōkichi accompanies it, reading \\"Kimi ga yo wo tsuki katametari haru no mochi\\" (\\"Tamping down the reign firm and solid like spring rice cakes\\"). Censors interpreted the print as a criticism of authority and had Yoshitora manacles for fifty days. Soon after Yoshitora was expelled from Kuniyoshi's studio, possibly due to the print, but he continued to produce illustrations prolifically. From the 1860s Yoshitora produced Yokohama-e pictures of foreigners amid rapid modernization that came to Japan after the country was opened to trade. He collaborated on a number of landscape series, and in the Meiji period that began in 1868 he also worked in newspapers. The last of his known works appeared in 1882.

He is best known for his extensive catalogue of dark folk-and-country-influenced solo work, including his 2019 Top 40 single, \\"Keep Me In Your Heart.\\" The 2019 Top 40 single has been successfully covered by many other artists and features in the 2019 film, Fisherman's Friends. He is also known for his brief tenure as the frontman of The Mercurymen. A musician from an early age, Jinder began a lifelong career in songwriting in his early teen years. Solo work and Candlefire Jinder was born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England. In the late 1990s, Jinder worked sporadically as a solo artist, before forming Candlefire with Daniel Minshull, Rick Porter and Mark McComish. The band are best remembered for their UK chart single \\"Sorrow Spreads Its Wings\\", released by One Little Indian Records in 2002. The single entered the UK Indie Chart at No. 17, and the mainstream chart at No. 97, dropping out of the top 100 the week after. Following the band's departure from the label in 2003, Jinder left Candlefire to pursue other musical directions. During Jinder's time with Candlefire, he also continued his sporadic solo work, appearing live on a short solo tour and releasing solo recording The Dusty Roads EP. Memorable Candlefire appearances under the management of David Duggan's Mostly Music Management include several UK tours and Candlefire's by-request performance at Coldplay's aftershow party following their Madison Square Garden show in New York City. Olas and Jinder and The Best Of Days Ahead In the summer of 2003, Jinder joined forces with fellow singer-songwriter Nick Cull, aka Olas, touring extensively together and releasing the album, The Best Of Days Ahead. as Olas & Jinder on the independent record label FrontSide Records in April 2004. Return to solo work and the release of Willow Park In 2004, Jinder amicably parted company with Cull and entered the studio to begin recording his debut solo album Willow Park. During this time, Jinder also toured in support of Martin Grech, recording and releasing Road:Live EP, a five-track EP culled from various tapings of shows made during the tour. After nine months of recording, Willow Park, Jinder's first solo album, was released on Folkwit Records in June 2005, drawing critical comparisons with The Blue Nile, Townes Van Zandt and Ryan Adams. The album posted excellent reviews and sales figures considerably higher than expected for a release on a small independent label. 2005 also saw Jinder touring throughout the UK, making 23 festival appearances in the course of over 200 live dates played in support of the album. I'm Alive In 2006, Jinder kept up his live schedule, and also recorded sophomore solo album, I'm Alive, produced by former Candlefire collaborator Stephen Darrell Smith. Released in May 2006, Willow Park, the album showcased Jinder's understanding of Americana, and displayed a more bluegrass and country/folk influenced direction. I'm Alive garnered even more critical plaudits than its predecessor, also finding extensive support and playlisting at regional radio stations around the UK. The album turned out to be the last that Jinder would record for Folkwit Records, with Jinder amicably parting company with the label in late 2006 to begin establishing Din Of Ecstasy, his own record label. Twenty Four Hours In early 2007, whilst still in the process of setting up his record label, Jinder reacted to his new freedom to record and release whatever and however he wished. His own challenge was to write, record, package, press and release an entire new album within a day. Twenty Four Hours was soon pressed in greater number, and remains a popular part of Jinder's back catalogue following its Deluxe Edition remastered re-release in 2015 on Din Of Ecstasy. The Three EPs 2007 saw the limited-edition release of The Three EPs, a compilation of Jinder's first three EP releases – The Dusty Roads EP from 2001, Road:Live EP from 2004, and the street-team-only The Years Of Winter EP from 2005. Also included as a bonus track was Jinder's cover of \\"Always on My Mind\\", originally taken from a various artists compilation, Eccentric Elvis, released in support of children's hospice charity Julia's House in 2005. The Mercurymen and Postcards From Valonia In 2006, following the sessions for I'm Alive, Jinder joined forces with Gavin Wyatt and Simon Johnson to form The Mercurymen. Stylistically influenced by such as Crosby, Stills & Nash, Richard Thompson and John Martyn, but driven by a folk- pop sensibility, the band recorded debut release The Keep Me in Your Heart EP in 2007, which was given a soft release by Flying Sparks Records in October of that year. In early 2008, The Mercurymen were signed by Sony BMG to their Arista/RCA imprint, and began work on their debut album Postcards From Valonia, which would be Jinder's sixth album, and was scheduled to be released in 2009, but the release never came about, following the band's departure from Sony BMG in November 2008. The band toured extensively in 2008, playing just under 150 shows, including touring with Deacon Blue, Melody Gardot, Level 42, Sinéad O'Connor, along with several festival appearances, including a show at The Tartan Heart Festival at Belladrum, Scotland, and a headline tour of small venues during that summer. The Mercurymen parted company amicably in July 2009, due in equal part to time constrictions placed upon the group by individual commitments, and the parting of ways from Sony BMG the previous November. Nine Cents From Benelux In January 2009, Jinder returned to the studio to complete new album, Nine Cents From Benelux, which was released through Din Of Ecstasy Records on 29 June 2009. On completion of the record, Jinder embarked upon a solo UK tour, sharing a bill with fellow singer- songwriters, Marcus Bonfanti and Lotte Mullan, which saw the three artists playing various venues on the UK roots music circuit. Following the release of Nine Cents From Benelux, Jinder continued to tour extensively, promoting the album with a UK headline tour and radio broadcasts. Until the release of Crumbs of Comfort in 2012, Nine Cents From Benelux stood as Jinder's best selling solo album, outselling his entire back catalogue 2:1. Crumbs of Comfort Following an extended period of seclusion in 2010 and 2011 spent writing the followup to Nine Cents From Benelux and starting a family, Jinder announced in March 2012 that his eighth album was completed, and would be released as a limited edition digipak CD via his website on 2 April 2012, before seeing a major international release via Mighty Village/Universal on 11 June. However, Crumbs Of Comfort, whilst a resounding success on an artistic and critical level, sold poorly upon release and proved to be Jinder's last release for Universal, with 2012 becoming the first year in 12 years without a major Jinder tour, the artist opting to take a six-month sabbatical to regroup, get well and focus on his young family following the disappointment of Crumbs Of Comfort. Subsequently, however, the album gained momentum through word of mouth and, in the four years following its release, overtook Nine Cents From Benelux in sales to become Jinder's best selling solo release. Crumbs of Comfort contains Jinder's best known song, \\"Keep Me In Your Heart\\", Elysium III (2010) and The Kondoors in 2015) and 'Let My Love Be Your Shelter', a cover of which featured on TV star Nick Knowles' UK Top 20 album 'Every Kind Of People' in 2018. Mercurymen reunion In January 2013, a press release claimed that The Mercurymen were to return to live and studio work following a four-year hiatus. A short six-date reunion tour was booked and the band played to sold out audiences across the UK, debuting new material and playing the highlights of their previous releases Postcards From Valonia and The Keep Me in Your Heart EP. The band are currently on hiatus once more but remain \\"open minded\\" to future collaborations. Traditional Dark In late 2014, it was announced via Jinder's social media platforms that a new album was in the final stages of mixing and is scheduled for release in the new year. The first Jinder album recorded to tape, Traditional Dark was released in February 2015 through Din Of Ecstasy Records, the first self- produced Jinder album since Willow Park, with Jinder recording all vocals and instruments on the album himself, with the exception of the drums, provided by Ryan Halsey. The songs from the album display a far darker and more intense aspect than those from the relatively pastoral Crumbs Of Comfort, with songs such as the minimal \\"Stations In The Valley\\" offering a harrowing oblique narrative on the Syrian refugee crisis, and the visceral rock of single \\"Boil The World\\" marrying ancient Hopi Indian prophecies with 21st Century apocalyptica. Deluxe edition reissue campaign In October 2015, Din Of Ecstasy digitally re-released Jinder's entire back catalogue in deluxe edition format. All records were digitally remastered and feature over 50 previously unheard bonus tracks. The biggest scoop of the reissues campaign was the release of the \\"lost\\" album Brother Flower-Jinder Sings The Songs Of Townes Van Zandt. Recorded in 2006 but never released, the album has attained almost mythical status amongst Jinder's following. The masters were found during the archiving process for the reissue campaign, and a decision to release the album was taken to put an end to the circulation of several poor quality bootleg versions of the LP. The albums reissued were: Jinder Presents...KINGSIZE BLACKFOOT In December 2016, Jinder announced the release of a Christmas single (a stark reworking of Bill Fay's \\"Pictures Of Adolf Again\\", a standalone release which was not featured on the subsequent album) and the impending arrival of a new album in mid-2017. The title of the new album was announced as 'Jinder Presents...KINGSIZE BLACKFOOT', via Jinder's social media outlets in April 2017, with the album release date slated as 17 July 2017, following the release of the first single from the album, 'Brother Can You Spare A Dime' on 22 May 2017. The album received extensive support at radio, with the A.B.B.A making it album of the month in September 2017, and over 150 radio stations worldwide playlisting tracks from the record. Traditional Dark:The Director's Cut During early sessions for forthcoming eleventh album The Silver Age, Jinder took the decision to remix and remaster 2015's album, Traditional Dark. Restoring the analogue warmth and sparkle from the original tapes that was lost during a troubled mastering process for the original release, Jinder added subtle instrumental flourishes, reinstated the track \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" that was left off the first release of the album, and oversaw the mastering process to ensure that the album sounded as originally intended. The new version of the album was released digitally on 8 March 2019. Fisherman's Friends In late 2018, it was announced that a new version of Jinder's best known song \\"Keep Me In Your Heart\\", re-recorded by Jinder in collaboration with producer The Atlas, was to be featured in the film, Fisherman's Friends, which was released in March 2019. The film peaked at No.2 on the UK Box Office Chart and, subsequently, at No.1 on the UK DVD Chart. The new version of \\"Keep Me In Your Heart\\", taken from the film, was released by Mighty Village/Universal in March 2019, peaking at No. 30 in the UK Singles Chart. The Silver Age In Summer of 2019, Jinder announced via Social Media that he was midway through recording a new album, titled 'The Silver Age', with producer Pete Millson. After a highly successful crowdfunding campaign to raise the required funds to complete the album, the first single from the record, 'Overthinkers Anonymous', was released to universal acclaim in Summer 2019. Peaking at No.14 in the UK download charts for iTunes, 'Overthinkers...' was a bold departure from Jinder's folk and roots stylings, and presented a new direction of muscular, '80s style synth- driven pop/rock. Following the success of 'Overthinkers...', followup single 'The Train to the Sky', an uptempo Stax-influenced romp with a deceptively melancholy edge, met a more muted response, eventually reaching No.62 with some regional radio support. Third single from the album, the moving orchestral ballad 'I Still Believe', fared much better, peaking at No.42 and selling consistently well, dipping in and out of the charts for six weeks. Garnering comparisons to The Blue Nile and Harry Nilsson, 'I Still Believe' has become widely regarded amongst fans as a masterpiece, and Jinder's very best work. The album, 'The Silver Age', was released in February 2020, and has, to date, been Jinder's best received solo record, selling respectably despite the entire UK and European tour for the album being cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. Almanac for the Failing Days In July 2020, Jinder announced via social media that a brand new album, titled ‘Almanac for the Failing Days’, would be released via Din Of Ecstasy on 7 August. Arriving less than six months after ‘The Silver Age’, with just a twenty second teaser video of the track ‘Peace is Here’ leaked prior to release, the album remains something of a mysterious entity. In the press release, Jinder stated \\"producer Pete Millson and I doubled down during the Covid-19 crisis, and created a musical document of the world disintegrating around us\\". Some of the ten songs from the album were premiered during Jinder's livestream concerts during lockdown in Spring 2020, including ‘Settle Down’, ‘Kamloops, BC’ and ‘Shawcross’, a chilling character portrait of prolific serial killer Arthur Shawcross .

The theatre is today mainly devoted to zarzuela (the Spanish traditional musical theatre genre), as well as operetta and recitals.A theatre for a genre... History of the Teatro de la ZarzuelaTeatro de la Zarzuela - Timeout Madrid History The theatre was designed by architect Jerónimo de la Gándara and built by José María Sánchez Guallart on the initiative of the Spanish Lyrical Company to provide a space for performances of operettas in the Spanish capital. It was modelled on the La Scala theatre in Milan with its three-level horseshoe form and opened to the public on 10 October 1856, the birthday of Queen Isabella II. The name refers to zarzuela, a theatre form that alternates spoken and sung scenes. Its promoters were established masters of the genre such as Francisco Asenjo Barbieri, Rafael Calleja Gómez, Joaquín Gaztambide, Rafael Hernando, José Inzenga, baritono Francisco de Salas, librettist Luis de Olona and composer Cristóbal Oudrid, under Francisco de las Rivas, an important banker. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Teatro de la Zarzuela became Madrid's leading opera house, staging many of the great masterworks. On November 9, 1909 the building was virtually destroyed by fire. The rebuild by Cesareo Iradier reduced the amount of wood and metal, and in 1914 Maestro Luna raised the curtain with his orchestra to reopen the theatre. With the Teatro Real opera house closed from 1925 to 1997, Teatro de la Zarzuela remained Madrid's leading venue throughout the period and hosted most major opera events. The theatre's resident ensemble is the Community of Madrid Orchestra. The ceiling originally featured magnificent works by the painters Francisco Hernández Tomé and Manuel Castellanos, but these were destroyed in renovations and structural changes that were made in 1956. The theatre then was acquired by the Sociedad General de Autores de España, although much of the facade and interior ornamentation was lost. Later it became the property of the state. In 1984 the Ministry of Culture, with Madrid still lacking an opera house, expanded the range of activities beyond zarzuela and opera to encompass flamenco and other dance. The building was given heritage status in 1994, and in 1998 was again remodelled, restoring much of the original structure and form.

The CBE offers programs in architecture, construction management, landscape architecture, real estate, and urban planning. From 1957 to 2009, it was known as the College of Architecture and Urban Planning (CAUP). Today, the College of Built Environments is made up of five core units: Architecture/Architectural Design, Construction Management, Landscape Architecture, Real Estate, and Urban Design & Planning. It also houses two interdisciplinary Ph.D. degrees, as well as several other interdisciplinary centers and institutes. The 2009 name change reflects an integrated approach to planning, design, and construction that will be necessary to take on the 21st-century global challenges of urbanization and climate change. History The College of Built Environments traces its history to 1914, when the Department of Architecture was founded (initially as a subdivision in a College of Fine Arts). The department grew slowly and focused strictly on architecture until the early 1940s, when a city planning curriculum was inaugurated. After the Second World War, the architecture and planning programs grew rapidly. The College of Architecture and Urban Planning was established in 1957; Arthur Herrman was the first dean. Architecture and Urban Planning (now Urban Design and Planning) were established as separate departments within the CAUP by 1961; Landscape Architecture and Building Construction (now Construction Management) were established as departments later in the 1960s. In 2017 the program in Real Estate, initially housed in the Department of Urban Design & Planning, became the Runstad Department of Real Estate. Other degrees and programs were added in the last fifty years, for example the Ph.D. in the Built Environment in 2003. In 2007 the faculty of the college began searching for a new name. The Regents of the University of Washington approved the name in fall 2008. The College of Built Environments name became official in January 2009. Facilities The College is housed in Gould Hall (named after Carl F. Gould, founder and first head of the Department of Architecture), Architecture Hall (constructed 1907–9 to serve as a chemistry building, but used during the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition as the Fine Arts Palace), and several smaller structures. Architecture Hall in 1909 The College has multiple facilities for supporting the work of students, faculty, and staff, including the Fabrications Labs (a 6000 square foot facility with tools and equipment for wood and metal fabrication as well as CNC tools and equipment for digital fabrication), the Digital Commons (which houses Computing Services for the College), and the Visual Resources Collection.Visual Resources Collection The Built Environments Library, a unit of the University of Washington Libraries is housed on the third floor of Gould Hall. Departments, Programs, and Administration The five CBE departments offer degrees in architecture, landscape architecture, construction management, urban planning and real estate. The College offers a college-wide Ph.D. in the Built Environment, and participates in an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Planning. Two interdisciplinary certificate programs are shared by multiple departments across the college: Urban Design and Historic Preservation. The CBE is led by Dean Renée Cheng who is advised by several Associate Deans. The Dean heads the CBE Executive Committee which includes the Associate Deans, the Department Chairs, and other administrative and staff leaders in the college. The Dean is also advised by the College Council, the elected faculty council (similar to the elected faculty councils found in all University of Washington schools and colleges). The College Council provides a structure for direct faculty input at the highest level of college administration. The CBE also has a college-wide Staff Council and a college-wide Student Council, vehicles for staff and student participation in college governance.
