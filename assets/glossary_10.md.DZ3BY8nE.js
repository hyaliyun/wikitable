Biography Giacomo Puteo was born in Majorca on February 13, 1495, the son of noble Antoni del Pozzo (from Nice, native of Alessandria, Piedmont) and Praxedis Berard i Caulelles.Entry from Biographical Dictionary of the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church He was educated at the University of Bologna, becoming a doctor of both laws. After university, he went to Rome and became auditor of Cardinal Pietro Accolti. During the pontificate of Pope Paul III, he became an auditor of the Roman Rota, a post he held for fifteen years, ultimately becoming Dean of the Roman Rota. On April 18, 1550, he was elected Archbishop of Bari. He never visited his archdiocese. Pope Julius III made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of November 20, 1551. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Simeon in Posterula on December 4, 1551. He was a participant in both the papal conclave of April 1555 that elected Pope Marcellus II and the papal conclave of May 1555 that elected Pope Paul IV. On May 29, 1555, he opted for the titular church of Santa Maria in Via Lata. During the pontificate of Pope Paul IV, he was Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura; a member of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office; and was cardinal protector of both the Kingdom of Poland and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Together with Cardinal Giovanni Battista Cicala, he was charged with examining abolishing the alienation of ecclesiastical patrimony done against the constitution of Pope Paul II. He participated in the papal conclave of 1559 that elected Pope Pius IV. He participated in the planning of the Council of Trent and was an active proponent of the Counter- Reformation. In 1561, he was named a papal legate to the Council of Trent, though his health did not permit him to attend the council. On December 16, 1562, he resigned the government of Bari in favor of his nephew Antonio del Pozzo. He died in Rome on April 26, 1563. He was buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

Its native range includes much of east Asia, including Japan, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Introduced to Hawaii in 1929 as a means of insect control, it has since become a common bird on the Hawaiian islands, and has become a vector for avian parasites that are now known to adversely affect populations of native birds such as Hawaiian honeycreepers, as well as spreading invasive plant species through discarded seeds. Effects on native Hawaiian birds The Japanese white-eye's successful invasion of the Hawaiian Islands can be partially attributed to the lack of coevolution between endemic species and the white-eye.Mountainspring S & Scott JM. (1985) Interspecific Competition Among Hawaiian Forest Birds. Ecological Monographs, 55(2): 219-239. The occurrence of coevolution is driven by species interactions that directly impact physical development. In many cases coevolution is derived from competition in which both species vie for an edge or advantage to maximize their dietary or \\"resource\\" acquirement. Because the white-eye did not coevolve with avian species native to Hawaii, the white-eye has certain advantageous characteristics, such as the resistance to avian malaria, that the native species do not possess.Woodworth BL, Atkinson CT, LaPointe DA, Hart PJ, Spiegel CS, Tweed EJ, et al. (2005) Host population persistence in the face of introduced vector-borne diseases: Hawaii amakihi and avian malaria. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 102: 1531–1536. The native species never had a chance to change in response to evolutionary changes in the white-eye. White- eye range expansion has also been cited as a negative effect on native bird species.Lammers TG, Weller SG, & Sakai AK. (1987) Japanese White-eye, an Introduced Passerine, Visits the Flowers of Clermontia arhorescens, an Endemic Hawaiian Lobelioid. Pacific Science, 41: 1-4. White-eye expansion is arguably characteristic of what E.O Wilson called a \\"Taxon Cycle\\".Ricklef RE & Cox GW. (1972) Taxon Cycles in the West Indian Avifauna. The American Naturalist, 106(948): 195-219. The cycle attempts to model the interactions between endemic species and newly immigrated non-native populations through the use of \\"Stages\\" –each with defined characteristics with respect to overall population behavior. A newly immigrated species (Stage 1) is expected to experience rapid growth through the new habitat largely due to the lack of effective endemic (Stage 3) persistence – the ability of the community to repel outside forces that may cause changes in its species composition. This prediction matches much of the current data indicating the white-eye has become highly common on most, if not all, of the Hawaiian Islands. The force of natural selection has promoted the dietary or \\"resource\\" specialization of many of the later stage endemic species – a prime example being the honeycreeper. This particular species has become especially affected by the white-eye presence due to honeycreeper dependence on nectar as a primary resource.Freed LA & Cann RL. (2009) Negative Effects of an Introduced Bird Species on Growth and Survival in a Native Bird Community. Current Biology, 19: 1736-1740. In contrast, the white-eye maintains a highly diverse selection of dietary options (including nectar) and is able to take full advantage of numerous habitats on the islands. The differences in resource limitations between the two species has resulted in the drastic decline of the honeycreeper population, as they are outcompeted by the invasive white-eye. This occurrence is best explained by the competitive exclusion principle, which dictates that two complete competitors cannot co-exist. Increases in the Japanese white-eye population in Hawaii have negative effects on the growth and survival of native birds in the community. In one study, the bill length, tarsus length, and mass of native Hawaiian passerine birds were measured during 1987-2006 using the technique of mark and recapture. In 2000, juveniles of every native species showed lower mass and shorter bills than before. These changes led to decreased survival of both juveniles and second year individuals/older adults. These birds also showed shorter tarsi, the group of bones in the hind feet of some vertebrates, although this change was less drastic than that seen with the bills. Birds with original bill lengths closest to that of the white-eye suffered the most, undergoing changes that lowered their foraging efficiency. For example, the endangered Hawaiian akepa was viable during 1987–1999, but not during 2000–2006, in association with an abrupt increase in white-eyes. These facts document strong community-wide exploitative competition for food between the Japanese white-eye and passerine birds native to Hawaii, meaning the white-eye depletes the availability of food for other bird species. They also compete for space; the white-eye has expanded its range into remote areas within the two decades 1980–2000.Gibson L. (2000) Rules and Regulations. Federal Register, 65(75): 20760-20769. The distribution of the Japanese white-eye has been shown to negatively correlate with the distributions of native birds, meaning as the white-eye becomes more highly distributed, native birds become less distributed. Many Hawaiian birds are endangered or already extinct; this occurrence is believed to be related to the invasion of the white-eye. Effects on Hawaiian plants Nest located in Kauai Because many of the Hawaiian birds that have gone extinct acted as pollinators, there is a concern about the survival of certain plant species, such as the Hawaiian Lobelioideae. The Japanese white-eye has been pinned as a possible replacement pollinator. Lobelioids that were pollinated by native birds that are now extinct may benefit from the presence of the white-eye, but more detailed studies are needed to determine the degree of pollen transfer affected by white-eyes. Also, this replacement could lead to differing levels of outcrossing compared to those resulting from visits by the native species of birds. Outcrossing is the introduction of unrelated genetic material into a breeding line. Therefore, white-eye pollination may prove to be beneficial, as outcrossing increases genetic diversity, thus reducing the probability of all individuals being subject to disease; increasing genetic diversity also reduces genetic abnormalities. Again, a more detailed study is needed to determine the potential benefits of white-eye pollination. A similar trend to that of Hawaii's was seen when the bird was introduced to the Bonin Islands of Japan; while native to the country, the white-eye was not originally present on these islands. As in Hawaii, the study conducted in the Bonin Islands suggests the Japanese white-eye may be taking over the actions of native birds in relation to plants present on the islands. Unlike Hawaii (in which this action was pollination), the action taken over by the white-eye in the Bonin Islands is seed dispersal; this dispersal was previously carried out by native birds – whether still present or already extinct.Kawakami K, Mizusawa L, & Higuchi H. (2008) Re-established Mutualism in a Seed-Dispersal System Consisting of Native and Introduced Birds and Plants on the Bonin Islands, Japan. Ecological Research, 24(4): 741-748. The white-eye has not been cited as taking over seed dispersal in Hawaii because they rarely ingest the seeds of Hawaiian plants, such as the firetree.Larosa AM, Smith CW, & Gardner DE. (1985) Role of Alien and Native Birds in the Dissemination of Firetree (Myricafaya Ait.-Myricaceae) and Associated Plants in Hawaii. Pacific Science, 39(4): 372-378. For this reason, they cannot disperse the seeds over great distances, making them poor seed dispersers. While the actions of the white- eye on the Hawaiian and Bonin Islands are indeed different, they are both significant, because islands themselves are particularly vulnerable to the drastic effects of introduced competitors, predators, and diseases when these communities have evolved in their absence.

It is 14 meters wide and 23 meters deep, and the deepest earth erosion in Europe. left Formation The evolution of the Devil’s Nest can be explained in three stages: during the Tertiary period, the Ice Age and the present time. Clearly, it took over million years to turn into the way it is now. During Tertiary the area was very dry and vulnerable to erosion. The surface of the mountain was eroded many meters, forming an erosion layer. At the same time, a vertical cut was formed in the surface which was filled with eroded material. This was the first stage of the Devil’s Nest. During the Ice Age period (about 2 million years ago) there have been 4 glacial events and between them, interglacial periods that were comparable to the present climate. These glaciers overrode the area several times, removing the eroded surface layer down to the bottom. The next glaciers have influenced the cavity and left different layers of granite and between them; sand and silt were accumulated during these periods. It was not until the end of last century when, through hard labor and much financial support, workers were able to remove all of the eroded materials. The hole was opened to the public by 1997. right =Mythology= The name of the Devil's Nest is derived from the tales of those believed that the Devil had lived in the cavity.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is dedicated to the Anglo-Saxon Saint Wystan (or Wigstan), who was formerly buried within the church's crypt. Description The Anglo-Saxon abbey church was cruciform and may have had a tower over its central crossing. The nave of the current church has Medieval Gothic north and south aisles that were rebuilt in the 13th century and widened early in the 14th century.Pevsner & Williamson, 1978, p. 305 The west tower and recessed spire were added in 1340. The top of the spire is above ground level. In the 15th century the nave clerestory with its timber roof and the two-storey porch were built and the tower windows were altered. Monuments inside the church include an alabaster effigy of a knight from about 1400 and monuments to members of the Thacker family from 1563 and 1710. The tower has a ring of eight bells, the oldest of which was cast at Leicester in about 1500. The church was restored between 1885 and 1886 by Arthur Blomfield.Derby Mercury, 28 July 1886 Crypt and royal burials The crypt, formerly part of Repton Abbey The crypt was constructed in the early 8th century; it was built over a spring and is thought to have originally been a baptistery. It was converted into a mausoleum for King Æthelbald of Mercia, during his lifetime. King Wiglaf and his grandson Saint Wigstan (after whom the later church is named), were also buried in the crypt. It is thought that the royal bodies were first buried in the ground to decompose before their bones were interred in the crypt. Following Saint Wigstan's burial, the crypt became a place of pilgrimage. However, following the Danish (Viking) invasion, St Wigstan's body was removed and taken with the fleeing monks. It was later returned but King Cnut had St Wigstan's remains removed again in the 10th century; having them reburied at Evesham Abbey in Worcestershire. Nikolaus Pevsner described the Anglo-Saxon parts of St. Wystan's parish church as \\"one of the most precious survivals of Anglo-Saxon architecture in England\\".Pevsner & Williamson, 1978, page 303 In addition to the crypt they include the chancel, the northeast and southeast parts of the crossing and part of the north transept. The crypt is a square chamber with a roof of three rows of three domical vaults supported by two pilasters on each wall and four free-standing pillars at the four corners of the central vault. =Royal burials= *King Æthelbald of Mercia – died 757 *King Wiglaf of Mercia – died 839 *Prince/Saint Wigstan – died 849 (remains moved by King Cnut to Evesham Abbey) =Archaeological sites= In the 1980s, a mass grave thought to be associated with the Great Danish Army was found in a mound, constructed over the remains of a Saxon chapel, to the west of St Wystan's Church in Repton by archaeologists Martin Biddle and Birthe Kjølbye- Biddle and their team.Biddle, M. & Kyolbe-Biddle, B., 1992, Antiquity, Vol. 66, 1992, pp. 36–51 and 2001, \\"Repton and the 'great heathen army', 873–4\\" in Graham-Campbell (ed.)

The remaining 80% were from men aged 18 to 45. Many of them showed signs of violent injury, and a variety of Viking artifacts, such as a Thor pendant, were found among the bones. Although initial radiocarbon dating suggested that the bodies had accumulated there over several centuries, in February 2018, a team from the University of Bristol announced that the remains could indeed all be dated to the late 800s AD, consistent with the time the army wintered in Derbyshire. They attributed the initial discrepancies to the high consumption of seafood by the Vikings. Because the carbon in the Earth's oceans is older than much of the carbon found by organisms on land, radiocarbon dating must be adjusted. This is called the marine reservoir effect.

The project began with a simple idea to create a landmark artwork and visitor centre that would act as a beacon for the Yorkshire region and a catalyst for change: The 32-metre-high stainless steel sculpture will be built in Sheffield, a town steeped in the history of steel production for generations. The Steel Man will honour the people and places that forged this heritage of Steel and it will highlight the new technologies and specialised manufacturing that is helping to generate the northern powerhouse. Schools, Universities and other educational facilities have embraced the project which will stand as a totemic symbol of British manufacturing and innovation. The sculpture and visitor centre project is widely supported by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council and a coalition of local companies and other organisations. It will stand on land provided by FCC Environment, (one of the world's largest waste services companies) next to the M1 motorway at Kimberworth in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. A 99-year lease has been generously provided by the landowners and work is expected to begin in 2017. The figure will be made from stainless steel, recognising the important development of stainless steel by Harry Brearley in Sheffield more than 100 years ago. It will sit on a coal-black column, which will honour the region's huge coal seams. The column will include an observation deck accessible by a lift and stairs. The sculpture will be widely visible to passing traffic travelling on the M1 across the Tinsley Viaduct and visitors to Meadowhall with a combined potential audience of many millions of people a year. The sculpture will overlook the site of the former Tinsley Towers (Blackburn Meadows) and provide a landmark as well as a catalyst for tourism and inward investment.The Steel Man gateway sculpture, Steve Mehdi Heritage Lottery Fund: The Steel Man was awarded Heritage Lottery Funding support in April 2016. The award helped fund an important education strategy and scoping research for sustainable income in the future. The award also enabled the design stage for an eco-friendly Interpretation Hub, which will include an exhibition space, café and a shop. Heart of Steel Appeal: The 'Heart of Steel' appeal was launched in July 2014 and has become an important part of The Steel Man: a 2.5 metre 1.5 tonne Heart of Steel will sit inside the figure, with up to 150,000 names of people from across the region engraved on it. Thousands of people with local connections and personal recollections have already donated to support the project. The Rotherham Heart of Steel is a full-size replica of the 'Heart of Steel' and was unveiled in the Minster Gardens in Rotherham town centre on 4 July 2015.

During the reign of King Nang Klao, a rich old woman named Faeng (แฟง)—Madam Faeng to the public—was a faithful Buddhist, despite being the owner of a brothel, called \\"Madam Faeng's Station\\", on Yaowarat Road. She raised funds from the prostitutes in her brothel to build the temple in 1833. To celebrate the temple's opening, Madam Faeng invited Father To, a monk who later obtained the ecclesiastical title of Somdet Phra Phutthachan (To Phrommarangsi), to deliver a sermon, hoping that the monk would praise her contribution. Father To's address noted that the merits made for displaying one's own virtue, however great, would result in low goodness. The monk said that the monies gained from prostitution spent in building the temple were considered the \\"sinful money\\", and that, for one pound of contribution, Madam Faeng would gain only one shilling of merit. Originally, there was no official name for the temple. The public called it \\"Madam Faeng's Temple\\" (วัดใหม่ยายแฟง, literally 'New Temple by Madam Faeng'). As from its establishment, the temple has been opened to the public and a site of public religious activities. When King Chulalongkorn ascended to the throne, Madam Faeng's descendants renovated the temple and petitioned the king for an official name. King Chulalongkorn named the temple Khanikaphon, from Pāḷi, Gaṇikābala, meaning 'the temple which was the result of the prostitutes' contributions'. The temple retains many items existing since its establishment, including the presiding Buddha image, the central hall, the image halls, a small pagoda, the cloisters, the masonic bell tower, and the ancient file cabinet. There is a model of Father To in front of the temple, and a half figure of Madam Faeng covered with gold leaves placed inside the wall. On the base of the Madam Faeng figure, there is an inscription: \\"This Wat Khanikaphon was established in 1833 by Madam Faeng, ascendant of the Paorohit Family\\".

Omar Faig Nemanzadeh was a Meskhetian Turk and was born in 1872, in Akhaltsikhe, Georgia. When he was 10, his family decided to send him to Gori gymnasium where prominent people of the Caucasus such as Chavchavadze and Stalin studied. However his mother was a devout Muslim and she was against his education in a Christian school. That is why he was sent to Istanbul and studied at the Fatih Madrasah. Omar Faig treated religious education skeptically and after two years, he transferred to secular Dar ush-Shafak seminary, where sciences and languages were taught and which had a reputation as breeder of liberal ideas in Turkey. In the last year of education at this school, Omar Faig began to work at a post office in Galata, and all magazines and newspapers published in Europe passed through his hands. Namely this acquaintance with liberal European ideas had a great significance in his formation. Approximately then Nemanzadeh connected with secret circles, with “revolutionary elements” of Istanbul, who contemplated Sultan’s dethronement. Most likely, the young worker inspired by liberalism ideas provided them with newspapers and soft news. In any case, one fine day police dispersed these circles. Omar Faig Nemanzadeh escaped from arrest barely being in time for a steamship to Batumi. Activity Returning to the Caucasus, Omar Faig began to act according to his ideals. He thought that enlightenment is the only way to change the situation – stagnation of the Turkic nation. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"  width=\\"50%\\" style=\\"background:#f6f6f6;\\"  “A long social, revolutionary and scientific preparation is necessary in order to destroy principles which are occurred from old traditions and to follow a new road. It’s very hard to achieve such changes in the sphere of culture and education without this preparation and to achieve any success… Development level of the nation can be identified by development level of teachers. Teachers’ issue – is the matter of life and death for the nation.” } Omar Faig began to teach. Beginning from 1893, he established schools in Shamakhi, Shaki, Ganja and Tiflis for ten years. “We consider the opening of schools in native language the most important task of today”, - he wrote in one of the declarations of his comrades – Azerbaijani democrats, whom he joined in 1892. Being always on move throughout the Caucasus and finally settling in Baku, Omar Faig became an outstanding person in socio-political life also due to his publications – particularly, in the only Turkish-language newspaper in Russia “Terjuman” (“Translator”). His article, dedicated to the first Muslim female school in Baku – he called it “an incomprehensible miracle” – was saved in archives of “Serveti Fuunun” magazine of Istanbul. That article drew a wide respond in the Muslim world – few people concurred Omar Faig’s thoughts that Muslim girls also need education. Nemanzadeh (second from the right) with other Azerbaijani writers of the 19th century (Jalil Mammadguluzadeh, Sultan Majid Ganizade etc.) In 1906, Nemanzadeh decided to publish his own publication. He had an extraordinary idea: to publish a grotesque magazine of caricatures with sharp satires, which could be understood by grassroots and illiterate people. He devised an appropriate name for it – “Molla Nasraddin”, in honor of a famous and favourite thinker and scoffer of the Turkic world, who chaffed greed people and supported the poor and honest. He couldn’t register the magazine himself – because Omar Faig was a “problem” person, and authorities were rather afraid of him. He invited Jalil Mammadguluzadeh to work as editor-in- chief. Two Tbilisi Germans: Schmerling and Rotter, who created absolutely new style for the magazine, became its illustrators; besides that their illustrations were understandable that they didn’t need any signature. Omar Faig and Mammadguluzade devised plots for the caricatures – problems existing in the Caucasus at that times could be seen in these caricatures: illiteracy, closed situation of women, arrogance of clerks and police’s outrage. In due course other poets and prose writers also began to write feuilletons in “Molla Nasraddin” magazine. Almost the first numbers of the magazine caused furor. Nobody expected such a success – soon the weekly magazine began to be published in 5000 number of copies and spread throughout the Turkic world. Despite its sharpness, the magazine wasn’t prohibited, although it was censored: there can be seen crossed out empty pages in archives. Omar Faig financed the magazine himself, but becoming the publisher he didn’t become rich. There also were problems with means. But from 1906 to 1909, the magazine was published without any restrictions. Then he was renewed in 1912, and later in 1917 again. And later the revolution began. Hard times Initially, Bolsheviks gave indulgences to people who were against tsarism – they even gave a great house with garden to Omar Faig in Akhaltsike. In 1920, when the republic in Baku collapsed and the Soviet regime was established there, the authorities gave an initiative: to continue publishing of popular “Molla Nasraddin” magazine by every possible means. And they promised to create all good conditions for it. But Omar Faig refused to participate in this project. He was engaged in other activities, which were closely connected to his nation. Soon he left Baku after the revolution and returned to Georgia – initially he led independent Gars Republic and then entered revolution committee of Georgian Republic as a representative of Muslim population. He always was a respected public figure. In 1937, he was arrested and shot.

In his 20s, Pan Mei worked as an usher (典謁) at his hometown of Daming (in modern Hebei) during the Later Han (947–951), and often told his close friend Wang Mi (王密) about his ambitions in taking advantage of the turbulent times for fame and riches. Career under Later Zhou After the establishment of Later Zhou in 951, Pan Mei served Chai Rong, the prefect (府尹) of Kaifeng. When Chai became the emperor in 954, Pan was named a court official. He followed Chai on campaigns against the Northern Han kingdom, and after playing a part in the victory at Gaoping, served in the palace commissions. Later he became the military inspector of an expeditionary army preparing to invade the Later Shu kingdom. Pacifying Yuan Yan In 960, general Zhao Kuangyin overthrew Later Zhou to found the Song Dynasty. As a former friend, Pan was given important tasks by the new emperor and he did not disappoint. First, Pan persuaded military governor Yuan Yan to submit to Song, then supervised the armies in quelling Li Chongjin's revolt in Huainan. Staying behind in Yangzhou after the victory, he was later sent to Qinzhou (秦州, in today's Qin'an County, Gansu) where he became the imperial commissioner of the local militia. Conquest of Southern Han In 963, Pan Mei was named the imperial defense commissioner of Tanzhou (today's Changsha) and sent to Hunan to help control the newly conquered province, which borders the Southern Han kingdom to the south. During the next 7 years, Pan pacified rebellious tribes in the southern half of the province and fought off Southern Han incursions in Guiyang and Jianghua. In 970, Pan was named the commander of the expeditionary force to invade Southern Han. In Fuchuan, he defeated the 10,000-men strong Southern Han army and subsequently took Hezhou. Quickly the Song army conquered Zhaozhou (昭州, in today's Pingle County), Guizhou (桂州, today's Guilin) and Lianzhou, resulting in the surrender of other prefecture leaders along the Xi River. Pan Mei's forces killed more than 10,000 enemy soldiers in Shaozhou (韶州, today's Shaoguan) to advance to 120 li north of Guangzhou, Southern Han's capital. Around 150,000 Southern Han soldiers were stationed on a hill for a last battle. Pan Mei rested his soldiers and mentioned to his subordinate generals that the enemy's bamboo fences could best be attacked by fire. On a windy night, he dispatched a few thousand brave men to the enemy's gate, each with 2 torches in hands. Soon great flames engulfed the camps, and as the Song forces attacked from both sides, tens of thousands of Southern Han soldiers perished. The Southern Han ruler Liu Chang was captured in Guangzhou, and the invasion ended 5 months after it began. Pan would remain to pacify the Lingnan territory for three years as the joint prefect of Guangzhou and commissioner of foreign trade. Conquest of Southern Tang In 974, Pan Mei led his troops north to Jiangling during the fresh campaign against the Southern Tang kingdom. One month later, he was named the military inspector of the troops under the overall command of Cao Bin and ordered to advance to Qinhuai. Reaching the Yangtze River, Pan Mei did not want to wait for boats to be built. Instead he motivated his troops by saying, \\"His majesty gave me tens of thousands of brave men, expecting victories. Are we going to let this narrow water deter us?\\" His men swam across the river and destroyed the enemy. After this victory, Pan Mei was rewarded and became a commissioner of palace attendants (宣徽北院使). Death of Yang Ye In 986, Emperor Taizong of Song ordered a new invasion to retake the Sixteen Prefectures from Liao Dynasty. The campaign was known as \\"Yongxi Campaign\\" under the era name of Taizong. Three armies participate the campaign, led by Pan Mei, Yang Ye and Cao Bin. Pan Mei command one of the three armies sent northward. During the first few advance, major victories over Liao forces were scored. However, from time to time, miscommunications, misunderstanding between the generals and the failure of Cao Bin had led Pan Mei and Yang Ye into disastrous situations. In a failed attempt to thwart an attack from Liao troops, without reinforcement from Pan Mei , Yang Ye was surrounded. His sons died one by one but his sixth son, Yang Yanzhao. As a result, Yang Ye was captured and died three days later. Following the death of Yang Ye, advantages now fell into Liao's hand. Song forces were pursued all the way to Bianjing, only with firm defenses held by Taizong emperor. Angered and furious by the death of Yang Ye, a few of Song's military officials were executed, others being thrown into exile. Pan Mei on his own was relegated and demoted to three ranks.

Early life  In May 1935, Wedderburn was born in Edinburgh. Wedderburn's father was Alexander Archibald Innes Wedderburn, a lawyer and auditor to the Court of Session. Wedderburn's mother was Ellen Innes Jeans.  Education  Wedderburn graduated from Exeter College, Oxford in 1959 and was awarded a Ph.D. by Heriot-Watt in 1992.  Career  Between 1968 and 2000, Wedderburn lectured at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. After his retirement, Wedderburn founded publishing company Fledgling Press. Wedderburn taught occupational psychology in the School of Management at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, for 32 years, and was a Professor Emeritus there. Most of his teaching was in the area of making occupational psychology available to business students and engineers, and in his final three years he established a part-time M.Sc. in Occupational Psychology taught jointly with Strathclyde University. His main research impact was on hours of work and shiftwork, where he became an internationally known authority, building on a British Steel Corporation Fellowship in 1970-72. His particular interest was in the interface between research and practice, with several measured practical interventions, a ten-year stint as editor of the Bulletin of European Shiftwork Topics, and founding editor of the Shiftwork International Newsletter. He was President of the British Psychological Society in 2003/2004, only the third occupational psychologist to achieve this in the past fifty years. He was a Fellow Member of the Working Time Society.  Personal life  In 1960, Wedderburn married Bridget Johnstone. They have four children and eight grandchildren.

At the beginning of 1474 the whole region around Shkodra, including the abandoned Baleč, came under Ottoman rule. According to some sources the Ottoman sultan had intentions to rebuild Podgorica and Baleč in 1474 and to settle them with 5,000 Turkish families in order to establish an additional obstacle for cooperation of Crnojević's Zeta and besieged Venetian Shkodra. During their 1474 campaign Ottomans damaged Alessio and razed Dagnum castle. Triadan Gritti was appointed as Venetian captain general instead of Pietro Mocenigo. Gritti led the Venetian fleet of six galleys which sailed early in May 1474 to protect the coast of Albania Veneta and especially the mouths of river Bojana. When the Venetian fleet entered Bojana the Ottoman forces attempted to block it by clogging the mouth of Bojana with cut tree trunks, just like Serbian voivode Mazarek did during Second Scutari War. Gritti returned his fleet down the river and destroyed Ottoman forces on 15 June 1474. Despite all of his efforts, Gritti was not able to deliver to Scutari all goods his fleet carried because many of his ships were trapped in the shallow waters of Bojana near Sveti Srđ. When Gritti joined Mocenigo in Shkodra and they both ordered to Leonardo Boldu to find Ivan Crnojević and to urge him to mobilize as many of his men as possible to help Venetians during the Siege of Shkodra. Boldu was also ordered to transport Crnojević's cavalry and infantry over the Skadar Lake. Ivan Crnojević had an important role in the defense of the Shkodra because he provided connection with Kotor and supplied the city through Žabljak or Skadar Lake, fighting simultaneously against strong Ottoman forces. He transported men and woods from Kotor over the hills into Žabljak where he built fustas which surprised Ottomans at Skadar Lake. During the whole summer Ivan Crnojević participated in military actions. He controlled Skadar Lake with three fustas and 15 smaller ships, which was very important because the Venetian fleet (composed of 34 larger and about 100 smaller ships) was unable to sail further than Sveti Srđ. Boldu was able to reach the besieged city from Žabljak thanks to the ships of Ivan Crnojević. The crew of Venetian ships together with stratioti from Greece joined the defenders in the besieged city and, according to some Venetian reports, their total number reached 25,000. After the discovery of the treason committed by Andreas Humoj, a member of Humoj family, during the siege, Gritti sentenced him to death and had him executed by a man from Tuzi. Between 7,000 and 20,000 Ottoman soldiers are reported to have been killed, and approximately 3,000 civilians from Scutari died of thirst and hunger.Merula, George. “The War of Shkodra” (1474). An English translation by Robert Elsie at www.albanianhistory.net/texts15/AH1474.html In the siege, the outer walls were damaged significantly. The citizens rebuilt the walls in anticipation of a stronger Ottoman attack later. The Ottomans did return in 1478 to conquer Shkodra.  References   Sources  =Primary= * Barletius, Marinus.

He broke away from the Ki Society in 1987 and founded the Shin-Budo Kai style of aikido. Early Aikido Career Imaizumi sensei first started training in aikido in April 1959 during his days as a student at Waseda University in Tokyo. He went to training sessions at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo which was located near the Waseda Campus. It was there he first met Morihei Ueshiba, (Ōsensei), during one of his aikido demonstrations. In 1965, Imaizumi became an apprentice to the teaching staff, shidoin, at the Hombu Dojo. He would often serve as uke, for Ueshiba during his early morning classes. First visit to the United States During his time at the Hombu Dojo he frequently trained under Koichi Tohei and became one of his supporters. This was a time of increasing tensions between several high-ranking instructors of the Hombo Dojo and the head instructor Koichi Tohei, starting with the death of Morihei Ueshiba in 1969 and culminating in Tohei's departure from the Aikikai in 1974. During that time in spring of 1972 he was instructed by Tohei, who was still serving as head instructor at the Hombu Dojo, to travel to Los Angeles in the United States to teach aikido and ki-principles under Roderick T. Kobayashi Sensei, who was the chief Instructor of the Western States Aikido Federation at this time. During his stay there he would tour the immediate Western Area of the US, teaching regular classes and spread Tohei's ki-principles. Ki no Kenkyukai Imaizumi returned to Japan after three months in California and served as an instructor at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo until 1974, when he joined Koichi Tohei in his breakaway from the Aikikai and the creation of Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido (Ki-aikido). Imaizumi and Tohei spent 1974 and early 1975 with the consolidation of the new Ki-aikido organisation and its new holdings. Second visit to the United States In June 1975, he was once again instructed by Tohei to travel to the United States as an ambassador of Ki- aikido, this time to New York, to help organise and run the dojos which had earlier joined Toheis new organisation. Before this, however, he would first accompany Tohei on a tour of the US new Ki-aikido dojos, more specifically in the Honolulu, Chicago, Philadelphia (and finally) New York regions. Tohei would later continue on to Boston alone to hold seminars while Imaizumi remained in New York to get things in order. Shiuzo held his first Ki-aikido class on the evening of July 22. New York Ki Society This new organisation was composed of Ki-aikido dojos in New York and was named New York Ki Society with Imaizumi becoming the Chief Instructor. On June 1, 1980 he was officially assigned the post of Chief Instructor for the Ki Society in the United States for a period of three years. After the three years had expired he nominated Koichi Kashiwaya, then the Chief Instructor of the Boulder Ki Society in Colorado, for the position of Chief Instructor for the United States. Imaizumi retained his title of main instructor for the New York Ki Society. Resignation and later return to aikido In September 1987, Imaizumi resigned from the Ki no Kenkyukai and martial arts in general, in order help with the management of the family business. During his time away from aikido he kept in touch with several of his former students of the ki-dojos in the US. Many of these students, scattered around the US in New Mexico, New York and Texas, had by now left the Ki no Kenkyukai and founded their own independent dojos throughout the US. They were unanimous in their wish for the return of Imaizumi. Since the situation was stable with his family business, Imaizumi was able to return to the US and resume his aikido career in April 1988. He did not return to his old position in New York, but assembled a group of independent ki-aikido dojos under a new organisation called Shin-Budo Kai. The organisation was officially created on October 1, 1988. Shin-Budo Kai is independent of both the Aikikai and Ki no Kenkyukai with Imaizumi serving as Chief Instructor. Shin-Budo Kai's emphasis is on knowledge provided not only by aikido, but on other martial arts and in Genkido; ki-exercises with the aim of teaching the student to fully understand the \\"True Martial Way\\" and the \\"way of cultivating one's body\\". Shin Budo Kai is headquartered in New York City, NY.

As with its predecessor, the goal of the game is to create efficient public transport systems in different major cities of the world. In this edition, there are several new features that the developers introduced based on community feedback about the previous game, including day/night cycles, rush hours and the ability to create timetables. The additions also include dynamic cities where players' decisions have a notable impact on city growth, and the inclusion of cooperative and competitive multi-player.  Gameplay  Gameplay of Cities in Motion 2 is similar to that of its previous game Cities In Motion. The player is required to place depots around the map of which routes will run out of and end in. Routes can either be circular or run in an A-B fashion but they must always start and end at a depot. Depots have a maximum number of vehicles held inside before another vehicle has to wait in a queue until another vehicle leaves the depot and makes space for it. More vehicles can be stored in a single depot and vehicles can hold more people and be cheaper through the use of a user created ruleset which can be created or modified in an in-game ruleset editor. The game has an extensive scenario with many missions spanning all in-game maps and custom scenarios can be created or modified using the in-game Scenario Editor. The game also has a built-in Map Editor. All custom Rulesets, Scenarios and maps can be shared via the Steam Workshop. Development Cities in Motion 2 was announced for Linux on 3 January 2014.

It usually has a drawstring, and is made of a stronger material (e.g., canvas) than mail sacks (e.g., plastic) and is designed to lock at the top with a mechanism system consisting of special closely spaced eyelets and a strong strap to secure the top where access into the bag is closed off and locked, where a mail sack does not have these features.Melius p. 40  Etymology and word origins  *According to the Online Etymology Dictionary mail is 12th century for letters or post. The meaning was further extended to \\"letters and parcels\\" in the 18th century by way of \\"bag full of letters\\" (1650s) or \\"person or vehicle who carries postal matter\\" (1650s). The Online Etymology Dictionary says that in 19th century England, \\"mail\\" was interpreted as letters going abroad and local communications was defined as \\"post\\". *According to the Online Etymology Dictionary pouch is late 14th century for \\"small bag in which money is carried\\", from Anglo-French puche, of 13th century Old French pouche and poche. It has a root Germanic basis and Old English pocca meaning \\"bag\\", which is a derivative from cavities in animal bodies. *According to The Free Dictionary by Farlex the word term \\"mail pouch\\" or \\"mailpouch\\" means pouch used in the shipment of mail. It has basically the same meaning as \\"mailbag\\" - which originated 1805–1815. U.S. Postal Service = First-class mail = In U.S. Postal Service (USPS) usage, first-class mail that would be carried in a mail pouch is mail sealed against postal inspection. An example of first- class mail is a typed letter or one written by hand. It must weigh less than 13 ounces.Division of the Federal Register, United States. Federal Register Division, United States. Office of the Federal Register, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1984, pp. 312-339. (Google eBook) =Registered mail= Registered mail that would be carried in a mail pouch is mail that is within a certain length and width, regardless of thickness. Registered mail can be insured up to $25,000 for a certain premium fee. There is no limit on the value of an item sent in by registered mail. Registered mail is closely guarded and given maximum security like in handling with a locked mail pouch. tossing a military mail pouch at sea = Military mail = Military mail that would be carried in a mail pouch is mail ultimately handled by the Military Postal Service (MPS), which is an extension of the United States Postal Service. Many times it is mail provided outside of the contiguous United States. = Domestic mail = Guam mail stamps Domestic mail that would be carried in a mail pouch is mail that would be ultimately delivered to United States territories and possessions (e.g., Army Post Offices (APOs), fleet Post Offices (FPOs), and the United Nations, NY). The United States Postal Service defines \\"territories and possessions\\" in its Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) as being American Samoa, Manua Island, Swains Island, Tutuila Island, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Commonwealth of the Rota Island, Saipan Island, Tinian Island, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Croix Island, St. John Island, St. Thomas Island, Wake Atoll, and Wake Island. Mail originating in the United States and going to or coming from the Freely Associated States is treated as domestic mail. These are the Marshall Islands, Ebeye Island, Kwajalein Island, Micronesia, Kosrae Island, Pohnpei Island, Yap Island, Palau, and Koror Island. =Diplomatic pouches= Diplomatic pouches are outside the control of the U.S. Mail. Thus, once a package is delivered to the U.S. State Department for inclusion in a Diplomatic pouch, the Postal Service considers it to have been delivered to the addressee, who then has the risks and responsibilities for its care and contents.  U.S. traveling postal service  = Closed-pouch and express-pouch service = According to a 1903 U.S. government report there was also a closed-pouch and express-pouch service associated with the U.S. traveling mail service. The report says that the number of clerks traveling in cars and boats was 10,555 and they traveled 235,114,604 miles. When added the closed-pouch and express-pouch service, the total number of miles traveled by clerks was 344,892,127. Owney on mail pouch = Through-registered pouches = \\"Through-registered pouches\\" are used in \\"through-registered service\\" of registered mail between post offices where hand-to-hand receipts can be obtained through the entire mail route of a Railway Post Office. Only certain Post Offices are designated \\"through- registered-pouch-offices\\". These pouches handle registered mail and have locked inner sacks within them. \\"Through-registered pouches\\" were not only made of canvas, but had several thick staples at the top where a long leather strap passed through and locked for extra security. These pouches that transported registered mail between large cities were made with leather bottoms for extra strength. Other mail pouch systems = Private mailbag = Some countries use a so-called Private Mail Bag (also known as a \\"locked bag\\") which addresses a worldwide need for specialized mail delivery to single location, and are used for delivery to particular customers, such as corporations or governmental agencies. This is in lieu of a Post Office Box. Some locked bag customers have individualized corporate postal codes.For example, the Washington Post has the unique ZIP code 20071. Like PO Box addresses, Private Mail Bag addresses omit the name of the building and street, and include only the number allocated to the user. Private Mail Bag addresses are often used in countries in Africa where there may be no street delivery service. In Europe and North America, where street delivery is more commonplace, large users may be allocated their own postal codes, and consequently need only use their physical address in correspondence; the postal code implies that the recipient receives mail by caller service. See M-bags, also called \\"Direct Sacks\\", which are large bags used for surface based shipment of large or heavy items to a single address. Mailbags are considered to be part of the postal system and are protected by law; interference with them can be the subject of criminal prosecution. Mail pouches in popular culture The form of the bag inspired the form and container of the West Virginia Mail Pouch Tobacco, which was featured on the ubiquitous Mail Pouch Tobacco Barn. This barn advertisement was created for the Block Brothers Tobacco Company. About 20,000 Mail Pouch barns spread across 22 states in the 1960s. The advertisements were popular enough to have fostered spin off mementos and memorabilia, including a Mail Pouch thermometer.

Its use was limited to exchanges onto moving trains. The specially constructed catcher pouch was grabbed by the catcher mechanism in the passing railway carMelius p. 40 and the catcher pouch would release from the holding rings on the mail crane. This technique was known as \\"mail on the fly\\". Starting in the 1870s the use of this technique of the Railway Mail Service was an important issue in the United States. It was a popular technique and the backbone of the United States Postal Service through the 1930s.As the United States Postal Service undergoes its fiscal crisis in the second decade of the 21st century, it is well to note that these are not entirely new problems. A national pickup and delivery system to remote and small locales is a fiscally challenging model. \\"A Congressional Investigation of the United States Post Office Department in 1900 disclosed that postal expenditures were not and, in some cases, could not be apportioned to revenues. A remarkable anomaly in Maine, at the intersection of mail bags and a printing press, provided, at the time, a basis for costing questions of policy and regulation and, for us now, an understanding of the postal commons in its Golden Age.\\"  Mail on-the-fly technique  When the mail clerk of the Railway Post Office car grabbed the catcher pouch on the mail crane he would at the same time kick out the outgoing mail for delivery to that village. The idea behind the catcher pouch was that there could be an exchange of mail to villages too small to justify the train stopping. The complete transfer technique (tossing out the outgoing mail a second before grabbing the catcher pouch) required much skill and potentially could cause harm or even death for those not trained properly. Another reason why the catcher pouch and mail crane were developed is so the train did not have to slow down just for the exchange of mail (Old School method). The mail on-the-fly was not a smooth operating technique. One problem with the technique was that the postal clerk had to pay close attention when he raised the train's catcher arm. If it was raised too early there was a chance of hitting and destroying switch targets, telegraph poles, and railway semaphore signals, as well as the train's mail catcher arm. If the clerk was too late in raising the train's catcher arm, he might miss the catcher pouch altogether. In the United Kingdom as early as 1855 an apparatus for snatching mailbags on-the-fly and delivering mail without stopping a train was in use at Slough, England. It continued in service until 1939.EARLY PUBLIC SERVICES Mail hook A mail hook is an installation alongside a railroad where a catcher pouch can be hung, to be picked up by a passing train without the train having to stop.  Nineteenth- century regulations  Catcher pouches could not be used for any other purpose. The catcher pouch was to be used only for letters (sometimes newspapers were an exception). The maximum weight of a filled catcher pouch was to be 50 pounds. The catcher pouch was to be locked and placed upside down on the mail crane no sooner than 10 minutes before the scheduled arrival of the Mail Train. The catcher pouch was to be tied in the middle before it was to be transferred. If a small amount of mail, it should be put in the lower half below the tie strap. If a large amount of mail, it should be divided equally between the upper half and the lower half of the catcher pouch.The Postal laws and regulations (Google eBook), United States. Post Office Department, G.P.O. 1893, pp. 239-240  Construction  The catcher pouch is a specialized form of sack made of an extra tough canvas material and had metal rings on each end so they could attach to the arm of a railway mail bag crane. The body of the pouch was strengthened by leather bindings both at the top and bottom. A Registered Mail pouch came also with a leather bottom and had a special postal lock to secure the contents. A leather strap was secured around the center of the canvas body of the catcher pouch when it was readied to be snatched by a passing train's mail hook.

A mail bag or mailbag is a generic term for a type of bag used for collecting, carrying, categorizing, and classifying different types of postal material, depending on its priority, destination, and method of transport. It is oftentimes used by a post office system in transporting these different grades of mail.However, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, a second definition is \\"the letters received by a person, especially a public figure.\\" Thus, for example, the \\"Mailbag special\\" featuring letter requests from viewers is a recurrent event on MythBusters. The mailbag is carried by some means of transporting like a mail carrier, animal (e.g., mule, horse), or a mobile post office. Letters and printed material delivered by mail in the seventeen-hundreds were carried by horse in a saddle bag. There are several different types of mailbags for different purposes (e.g., transporting mail to and from post offices, delivering mail to businesses and homes. These different styles of mailbags depend on its size and purpose. It can range from \\"a large bag used for transporting mail on a truck, plane, etc.\\" to a simple \\"postbag\\" used by a mail carrier to deliver mail. The idea of having mail bags on board ships traveling between Jamaica and Great Britain was established as early as 1780. The name of the ship carrying a letter was put on the corner of the letter so that it would be put into the proper mail bag for the destination intended. A mailbag throughout the United States history has been called various names depending on its form and function at the time, some of which are now obsolete.

Mailbag in popular culture Mailing children is forbidden, photo courtesy of Smithsonian Institution * With the advent of Parcel Post in 1913, after some adults sent their children in the mails with postage affixed to clothing the U.S. Postmaster General issued regulations barring such shipment. The theory was that children were under the 50 lb. weight limit, and that it was a lot cheaper to mail them than to pay rail fares. In part, the regulation followed a letter inquiring as to whether parcel post would be appropriate, and the Postmaster General was of the opinion that children were not within the definition of \\"bees and bugs\\", which were the only fauna permitted to be mailed. Nevertheless, several children were actually mailed. On 13 June 1920, sending children by Parcel Post was officially forbidden. Thereafter, a mail bag stuffed with a child was prominently featured in a humorous photograph to illustrate the prohibition. *The form of this sack is so evocative and iconic that it inspired the \\"counterfeit mail bag\\" in The J.

An example would be library books transferred through the interlibrary loan system. = M-bags, also called \\"Direct Sacks\\" = A special type of mail sack is one that is used to transport bulk mail, particularly printed matter, to a single recipient at a single foreign address. There is no minimum weight, and the maximum is a tare weight of 66 lbs. An M-bag is 4 feet tall and 36 inches in diameter. Every piece of mail in an \\"M-bag must be marked 'Postage Paid - M-bag.'\\" This type of shipping is especially prized by book stores and peace corps volunteers. It is an economical and secure way to move a lot of mail over a great distance on the surface (not air mail). Plans to discontinue this service originating in the USA in 2007 met with opposition. In August, 2007, subsidized rates were drastically curtailed. This gave rise to \\"complaints from everyone from scholars to record-album collectors - all of whom bemoan the loss of subsidized rates for research and educational (which includes entertainment) materials.\\" See Private Mail Bag. = Foreign mail sack = A mailbag used to transfer mail to a country other than the United States is defined as a \\"foreign mail sack\\". The normal design is that the top is closed with a drawstring like a leather strap. It is sealed using a lead seal (not a lock as in a mail pouch).

Etymology and word origins  *According to the Online Etymology Dictionary mail is 12th century for letters or post. The meaning was further extended to \\"letters and parcels\\" in the 18th century by way of \\"bag full of letters\\" (1650s) or \\"person or vehicle who carries postal matter\\" (1650s). The Online Etymology Dictionary says that in 19th century England, \\"mail\\" was interpreted as letters going abroad and local communications was defined as \\"post\\".mail (n.1) *According to Online Etymology Dictionary the etymology of \\"satchel\\" is mid 14th century from Old French sachel from Latin of saccellum (money bag, purse) and sacculus or saccus (bag or sack). * French: avec poignées means carrier bag with handles and sometimes refers to a postal mail sack. *According to an online dictionary \\"mail bag\\" originated 1805–1815.mail pouch definitionmailbag definition  History  Commonly referred to as \\"satchels\\", letter carriers used leather-over-the shoulder type mail bags on their delivery and collection rounds. This form of satchel was most popular in city delivery service and city collection service. It has been used from about the 1860s in the United States and from the late 19th century in other countries worldwide. The city collector's satchels have two handles off the top of the leather bag itself. Formerly made of leather, such satchels were later made in lighter, but less durable, canvas, today a variety of materials may be encountered including hard wearing synthetics.  Postal service by letter carriers  In August 1971, the United States Postal Service declared that when the existing stock of leather satchels was depleted, they would be replaced with canvas. The cited reason was the high price of \\"scarce\\" leather. The new canvas satchels also had a weight advantage, about 2 pounds, compared to the old leather mail bag's 4 pounds. The disadvantage of the new canvas satchels was durability, lasting about eighteen months before they had to be replaced, compared to a six-year lifespan for the old leather satchel. Beginning in 1978, the new U.S. canvas style satchel mailbag bore an escutcheon on the middle outward facing panel: the U.S. Postal service's left- facing eagle logo starting in 1978. In 1986, the left-facing eagle logo was changed to a right-facing eagle logo. The old style of a left-facing eagle logo was still in use through 1989. In August, 1996, the satchel was again modified: the old style logo of a normal winged eagle was replaced with a futuristic \\"sonic eagle\\" logo. Reflective glow in the dark stripes added in December 1996. In October 1997, a new double satchel was added to the tools used by U.S. letter carriers. Its advantage was that it would more equal weight distribution to prevent shoulder, back and neck strain. Its disadvantage was that it was a hindrance to defense from charging dogs. The preference to many letter carriers is the traditional single satchel where they are free to fend off dogs (e.g. pepper spray usage). As one might expect, the form and structure of mail satchels has implications for fatigue and industrial injuries to mail carriers.

United Kingdom \\"mail trolley\\" (postman's cart) or the European / Asian \\"mail bike\\" is an accessory tool for letter carriers of cities to assist their normal everyday over-the-shoulder heavy mail satchel. This type of accessory is used to cut down on return trips to the postal vehicle to collect or drop off mail. In Britain, mail trolleys are controversial, and viewed as a threat by some to the viability of bicycles, which use a form of satchel bag.\\"It is nonsense to suggest that we are phasing out the bike. We have 30,000 nationally and the bicycle is a key part of our equipment and will remain so.\\" A \\"mail trolley\\" is used in the United Kingdom in addition to bikes for the \\"postmen\\". Meanwhile, hundreds of surplus British postal bikes are recycled to African villages to provide basic transportation. It is also an employee safety feature because the cart is carrying the load, which could be up to 70 pounds, where a hand over-the-shoulder mail satchel for letter carriers carries up to 35 pounds of mail. Postmasters authorize the use of satchel carts on certain the routes that would justify its use. Satchel carts carry two \\"mail satchels\\" that each would carry 35 pounds. Postmasters consider the following factors in assigning satchel carts: :* Relieves the letter carriers from carrying heavy loads of mail all the time (safety feature). :* Letter carriers with physical impairments get first priority. :* If the satchel cart is a detriment and slows down the letter carrier on his route, then the push cart is taken away from that letter carrier and given to another or put in storage. :* When a letter carrier uses a push cart, the normal 35-pound mail load limit does not apply. The two satchels on the cart are filled to capacity on each use, which could be as much as twice the normal 35-pound over-the-shoulder satchel mail load limit. :* Due to the greater carrying capacity of the 4 wheeled push cart the relay mail pick-up points are adjusted to be less often. The typical \\"satchel cart\\" used by United States Postal Service is a four-wheeled cart with its mailbags that has a collapsible handle and front wheel brakes. It was used by the letter carriers in the late twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. The future for mail carrying in some parts of the world may be represented by the Indian Postal Service's attempt to develop and deploy electric cargo tricycles. It has been suggested as a way to replace bicycles in India with vehicles that will enable carriers to travel farther and carry more at a lower cost. The \\"Soleckshaw\\" is \\"specifically suitable as a light delivery vehicle, for delivery of post, parcels and other postal services both in urban and rural areas\\". It has been observed that the general trend in mail deliveries is a decrease in letter volume and an increase in the number and size of packages; bulk and weight increased so mail delivery methods had to be changed as a result. In one intracampus mail system, it was found that the use of Segways decreased emissions. \\"Increasingly heavier trays were leading to workplace accidents, exhaustion and dissatisfaction.\\" Segway PTs fitted with custom mail bags, a derivative of the over-the-shoulder personal mail satchels, were seen as a cure for the postmen for many of these problems. Letter carriers in the United Kingdom are instructed to use mail \\"trolleys\\" to prevent injuries from heavy shoulder satchels, and to not use bicycles.

Meigs, Jr. (1764–1825) A portmanteau (, ; plural portmanteaux or portmanteaus) was a traveling bag (suitcase style) used as a mailbag. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, both newspapers and letters were transported in these leather mailbags that opened into two sections.  Etymology  The etymology of the word is the Middle French porte-manteau, from porter, \\"to carry\\", and manteau, \\"coat, mantle\\". A court official carried the robes of a king in a portmanteau (traveling bag). The portmanteau had two hinged compartments and hence this idea of \\"two\\" carried over into early America.See Portmanteau (words).  History  English merchant Thomas Witherings established mail routes throughout Europe in the 1620s. He drew up a proposition in 1635 for an English mail system based in London in which portmanteaux (containing 2 leather bags lined with cotton) could travel to European towns with sealed bags of mail for protection against spies. The system was put into motion and some 26,000 letters mailed safely unopened between London and European towns each week. In the nineteenth century the official portmanteau was used to carry the mail (two items: letters and newspapers) on New England stagecoaches that traveled the post roads.John, p. 32Encyclopedia.com / The Post Office Before 1789 newspapers were mostly excluded from the mail and the official portmanteau. After the 1st United States Congress (1789–1791) the postmaster general allowed printers free postage to communicate reports and articles of newspapers with other publishers in other towns and cities to distribute Congressional information. This came about because of complaints to Thomas Jefferson. Congressmen then mailed issues of Congressional newspapers to their home districts. The congressional privilege was expedited using a special signature or marking called franking which allowed this free postage for their newspapers and other mailings. These Congressional newspapers allowed for a great number of newspapers accessible to local newspapers about news from Congress. The post rider's dependable official portmanteau delivery system could be used then which gave the newspapers a good chance of arriving. Before this the newspapers were carried outside the official portmanteau by the post riders and had a small chance of completing their journey. The Postal Service Act of 1792 legally allowed Congressional newspapers into the mail system postage free: Despite this, postal officers often still did not allow newspapers to be carried in the official portmanteau with the regular mail.John, p. 295, Note 47 Where the mail was carried by post riders at the time, then the newspapers had to be light and able to fit in the saddlebag or else they were likely to be left behind because they would be too much of a load for the rider. Post riders carried official portmanteau horse leather saddlebags that carried the mail, that contained Congressional newspapers, on their horse's backside, which were locked and could only be opened by an authorized postal person. This procedure came about because of constant complaints of personal mail being previously opened before arrival. The letters and newspapers were divided into two separate canvas or linen bags and placed inside portmanteaux for distribution. In the nineteenth century the portmanteau mailbag (French term: grand sac des malles) was used on the postal route from Fredericton, New Brunswick, to Amherstburg in Canada. The portmanteau mailbags were made of waterproof material such as a heavy leather. In some cases, the portmanteau mailbags were covered with tarpaulin cloth, India rubber and oilcloth to prevent water from entering. The post office system was quite primitive in the beginning and had little organization. The mail was often carried from post office to post office in large portmanteau mailbags. The official portmanteau went from post office to post office and opened by the local postal official at his stop. The postal official then took out the mail that pertained to his local people (who came to the post office to collect their mail) and then passed it onto its next destination point, who's postal official did the same, until the end of the route. When the mail arrived at a local post office, the postal official would take the mail meant for his post office and pass on the rest of the mail without much care in handling. The portmanteau mailbag was then clumsily closed and sent to its next post office on route. In this haphazard handling of the portmanteau, mail would often get mutilated to the point where it was no longer readable. Sometimes mail was even lost on route. Due to the roads of the time being in less than desirable travel condition, mail was often delayed. The contractors and carriers took little care in handling the mail. On July 1 of 1836 the Postal Act of 1836 went into effect to improve mail delivery with the portmanteau mailbags.National Archive's microfilms: The Post office Department Reports of Site Locations, 1837–1950; M1126, roll 453, and the Record of Appointment of Postmasters, 1832 – September 30, 1971; M841, roll 99.

This was the country's eighth appearance in a Summer Paralympic Games. The Maltese delegation consisted of a single short-distance swimmer: Matthew Sultana. In his three events, the men's 50 metres freestyle S10, the men's 100 metre butterfly S10 and the men's 100 metre breaststroke SB9, he failed to qualify beyond the first round. Background Malta debuted in the Paralympic movement at the 1960 Summer Paralympics. Excepting the period between 1988 and 2004, the island country had participated in eight Summer Paralympic Games and medalled a total of seven times in athletics, lawn bowls, snooker and table tennis. The 2012 Summer Paralympics were held from 29 August to 9 September 2012 with a total of 4,237 athletes representing 164 National Paralympic Committees. Matthew Sultana, a short-distance swimmer, was the sole athlete to represent Malta at the London Summer Paralympics; he was chosen as the country's flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony. He and his coach Ebi Mohammadpour travelled to London on 30 August. Marathon runner Derren Fenech met the minimum qualifying standards for his event; a number of athletes who had times lower than three hours created an upper limit on participants and forced him to withdraw. Disability classification Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories: amputation, which may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, though there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; and Les autres, which is any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, like dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities. Other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. Swimming At the time of the London Paralympics Matthew Sultana was 15 years old and was the only athlete to compete for Malta. He attained qualification to the Games by winning three age-group medals at an international meet in Berlin. Sultana has an upper limb deformity, and is classified S10 by the International Paralympic Committee. He trained with the non-government organisation Inspire for two and a half years and entered a classification race on 28 August to enable his participation. Sultana said his young age was unimportant and he entered the Paralympics to improve his personal best, \\"I want to shave off one second to 29 seconds in the 50m freestyle and possibly finish the 100m butterfly race in 1.20 or 1.19 instead of the present 1.24. I am here and it’s more than enough. I want to continue training to be ready for the next Paralympics in four years’ time.\\" On 31 August, he competed in the men's 50 metres freestyle S10 competition and was assigned to take part in heat two. Sultana completed the heat in seventh place in a new personal best time of 31.12 seconds. This put him 21st (and last) overall and he did not qualify for the final—the eight overall fastest swimmers made that stage of the competition. Sultana took part in the men's 100 metre butterfly S10 event the following day, being drawn into heat three. He finished the race in a time of 1 minute and 16.94 seconds and placed eighth in his heat. As only the top eight overall finishers could advance to the final, Sultana was eliminated from the competition. On 8 September, he participated in the men's 100 metre breaststroke SB9 contest. Sultana was drawn into heat two and completed the race in sixth position in a time of 1 minute and 36.89 seconds. His competition ended since he was slowest overall and only the top eight swimmers progressed to the final. =Men= {class=wikitable - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athletes !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Heat !colspan=\\"2\\"Final - !Time !Rank !Time !Rank - align=center align=left rowspan=3Matthew Sultana align=left50m freestyle S10 31.12 PB 20 colspan=2Did not advance - align=center align=left100m breaststroke SB9 1:36.89 16 colspan=2Did not advance - align=center align=left100m butterfly S10 1:16.94 21 colspan=2Did not advance } See also *Malta at the 2012 Summer Olympics References Category:Nations at the 2012 Summer Paralympics 2012 Paralympics ","title":"Malta at the 2012 Summer Paralympics"},{"id":"36736173","text":"Pony Express mochila exhibit Mochila leather cover over saddle Pony Express reenactment demonstrating the mochila Pony Express \\"mochila\\" closeup. Each of the riders signed the bag as it moved through the states. Statue of Pony Express rider on a mochila A mochila (Spanish,mochila, Diccionario de la Real Academia Española, 22ª edición. pronounced [mo-chee-lah], for \\"knapsack\\", \\"pack\\", \\"pouch\\") is a removable lightweight leather cover put over a horse's saddle. In the 19th century, it was used as a mail bag by the Pony Express. Slits were cut through the eighth-inch leather to allow access to the saddle horn and cantle.Tucker, p. 18 Riders of the Pony Express made quick exchanges to new fresh horses, usually within a few minutes, at each remount station on their route across the United States. The mochila was removed from the exhausted horse and swiftly placed over the saddle of the fresh waiting horse. Etymology Linguist Joan Corominas derived the Spanish mochila from mochil (\\"delivery boy\\"), itself from Basque mutil (\\"boy\\").mochila in Diccionario crítico etimológico de la lengua castellana, volume III, page 392, Joan Corominas, Francke Verlag-Bern, 1954 The word \\"mochila\\" connotes the soft sheepskin leather.  History and usage  Saddle bag mail pouches were never in use on the Pony Express system because of their unwieldiness. The normal large saddle bags could not be attached to a saddle efficiently and would cause much delay when switching from an exhausted horse to a fresh horse at a Pony Express station. In 1860, the Pony Express developed a fast mail delivery system using a special saddle mail bag cover called a mochila that made the Pony Express unique. The cover, which had four hard leather boxes to carry the mail, was transferred quickly and efficiently, usually in less than two minutes. If a horse was injured on the way from one station to another and not capable of further traveling, a rider would simply remove the cover with its mail from the injured horse and walk to the next station, where he would throw the cover on a new horse. The leather blanket cover was designed by Pony Express rider Jay G. Kelley.Van der Linde, p. 23Israel LandisPony Express saddle The mochila also had four pockets, called cantinas, that were lockable with a type of small padlock and could only be unlocked by authorized people. Two cantinas were in front of the rider's legs and two were behind the rider's thighs. Documents to be transported in the cantinas would first be covered with oiled silk to protect them from water and sweat. This mail service was very expensive (between one and five dollars per half-ounce, an astronomical amount that only businesses could afford). Most Pony Express saddles and mochilas were made by Israel Landis' shop in St. Joseph, Missouri. Israel made the entire saddle about one-third the weight of the ordinary Western saddle. The specially designed saddle with its mochila weighed less than 13 pounds. The saddles and mochilas were standardized so they would work from one horse to another. When full of mail and telegrams, the mochila weighed about 20 pounds. The rider would also carry a canteen of water, a gun and a small Bible that included the solemn Pony Express loyalty oath.. The saddles for the horses that traveled over the Overland Pony Express route were special and standardized, built by a saddlery firm owned and franchised by Landis. No authentic Pony Express mochilas have survived. Replicas have been made for demonstrations such as Wild West performances and modern-day reenactments.

His father William Jackson Bean was a botanist, author, and curator of Kew Gardens. Bean was educated at St Paul's School, London from 1916-1921. He attended Pembroke College, Cambridge and won the Schoolbred Scholarship and the John Stewart of Rannoch Scholarship for Classics.  Career  Bean returned to St Paul's School to teach ancient Greek in 1926. He took his M.A. from Cambridge in 1930. In the 1930s, he organized summer school trips to the Aegean coast of Turkey. In 1943, in the middle of World War II, he was recruited by the British Council to teach English in Izmir. Several years later, he helped to set up the archaeology department at the University of Istanbul. He stayed on in Istanbul, teaching classics at the university for 24 years. Between 1943 and 1971, Bean travelled extensively in rural Turkey in order to discover and record its classical remains. Over the years, he became a well-known and respected figure in the countryside. The publisher Ernest Benn commissioned him to write a series of archaeological guidebooks on the region. The result was a series of four books describing the classical archaeology of Turkey. These are: * Aegean Turkey * Turkey beyond the Maeander * Turkey's Southern Shore * Lycian Turkey He was a friend of the Oxford-educated classicist Terence Mitford, and together they undertook numerous journeys into the Turkish interior. They also wrote two books together, titled Journeys in Rough Cilicia.G.E. Bean/T.B. Mitford: Journeys in Rough Cilicia, two volumes, Vienna 1965 and 1970. Bean was a physically imposing man, six foot six in height. He was an avid player of badminton and tennis, and once reached the third round at Wimbledon.

Glencripesdale was a grand house built for, and uniquely designed by, the Newton brothers in 1874 and featured 28 bedrooms. Twenty of these bedrooms were large and for the use of family and guests, with the remaining eight for servants quarters with multiple beds, some in dormitory style rooms. The house is believed to be the first in Scotland to be built of the as then state of the art material, Concrete. Materials had to be floated along the loch due to the lack of access to the site from nearby roads, mainly by steam ship. The cement was mixed with pebbles off the shore Because the house was largely served by sea, due to the remote nature, the house featured its own private Dock for steam ships of up to 100 tonnes, such as the SY Kelpie, the Newtons 100 ft Steam Launch. The Factors house, or Land Agent as he would be known in England, situated a few miles East up the coast at Laudale, still exists and is a substantial dwelling in its own right having been built with 9 bedrooms, and has been enlarged further over the years. Architectural style and location Glencripesdale House featured a very distinct and unusual blend of architectural styles including, among other things, white harled walls, Gothic windows and a large tower which resembled a lift-shaft crowned with crowstep gables. The house was a blend of new building methods, “traditional” Scottish Baronial elements and a general appearance suggestive, perhaps, of a monastery in parts. Whilst unconventional in style, the result was considered pleasing. With two of the three Newton brothers being clergymen, some have remarked that the ecclesiastical flavour of much of the building is perhaps attributable to their career choice. There is a suggestion that they actually designed the house themselves using a church plan as a basis. Another suggestion is that the architect Temple Lushington Moore may have helped design the property, having already designed a large country house Holmwood, Redditch for Canon Horace Newton. A guest of the family Elizabeth Inglis noted on a visit to Glencripesdale approximately ten years after the house was built that the approach route from the loch was suitably atmospheric: “To reach Glencripesdale house our track up the hill led past an ancient burying ground, impressive in it s loneliness, its ancient trees standing in reverent bending lines, keeping silent guard over the grey recumbent tombs”.Michael C. Davies, The Lost Mansions of Argyll. Published privately, 1983 Post-1920s domestic and military use The house was occupied by the British military during World War II, specifically the Commando units, who needed extreme countryside to practice manoeuvres on. The Newtons returned at the end of the war to find large amounts of their belongings had been stolen, and the property and outbuildings severely damaged by the troops, requiring large sums to repair, which was not uncommon at the time. This, combined with the fact that like many large houses who relied on large numbers of staff to run, meant that the house was not occupied again, and slowly fell into disrepair. Destruction Following World War II, a new owner Mr Epps bought the House in 1954 and stripped its lead off the roof, leaving the buildings shell exposed. He was apparently able to sell the lead for more than he had bought the property for. The estate with the shell of the house was sold to the Forestry Commission, who slowly planted up the woodland with conifers and then sold off the estate in chunks throughout the 1990s. In 1966 the house was blown up by the Army as part of an exercise with consent of the Forestry Commission,Army Website on Glencripesdale during Wartime occupation demolition later and due to the unique construction, being built of reinforced concrete, required two attempts to blow up. The first time the Army used a normal amount of explosive for the size of the building, however once the dust had cleared the building still stood. The ruins still remain on the original site, however the land has become very overgrown.

She was expelled from Kathmandu by the government for her religious activities. Page 47. Dharmachari was a progressive and fought social mores and government repression to become a nun. She acquired an education and traveled out of the country to study Buddhism and receive ordination. Page 223. Dharmachari also established the first nunnery in Nepal. Page 23. Early life Laxmi Nani was born at Dhyākwachhen, Asan, a historical neighborhood in central Kathmandu. She was the fourth among seven siblings. Her father was Man Kaji and mother Ratna Maya Tuladhar. During Laxmi Nani's early years, it was difficult to receive an education, and for girls even more so. However, encouraged by a neighbourhood shopkeeper and her mother, she taught herself to read and write. In 1909, Laxmi Nani was married to Sete Kaji Bania of Itum Bahal who belonged to a family of hereditary herbalists. A son was born to her in 1916 who died in infancy. In 1919, her husband died when she was seven-months pregnant with their daughter. In 1927, her daughter died too. The loss of her entire family in a few years made her become more deeply involved in religious activities.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005). Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal. Harvard University Press. , 9780674019089. Page 46. Dharma teacher As Laxmi Nani (alternative names: Laxmi Nāni Upāsikā, Laxmi Nāni Baniā) was literate and skilled in mixing herbal medicines, she was a respected member of the household. She fulfilled her responsibilities in the extended family even as she studied Buddhist books. She taught what she learned to a group of women students who met at Kindo Baha, a 17th-century monastic courtyard at the foot of Swayambhu. The dilapidated monastery had been restored in 1926 by the efforts of Buddhist scholar Dharmaditya Dharmacharya and benefactor Dharma Man Tuladhar. Page 103. The gatherings at Kindo Baha attracted the attention of a suspicious government, and the women were hauled before the prime minister. He told them that studying religious books and speaking in front of a crowd was not for women, and that they should go home and look after their families. However, they continued to study in secret. Laxmi Nani also composed hymns in the Newar language. Her composition was first printed in 1929 in the magazine Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa published from Kolkata. The songs urged women to acquire an education and exposed social evils of the day.Tuladhar, Lochan Tara (2007). Dharmachari Guruma. Kathmandu: Nirvana Murti Vihara. . Page 14. Ordination in Burma In 1930, the return to Nepal of Pragyananda Mahasthavir, the first yellow-robed monk in the country since the 14th century, propelled the Theravada Buddhist movement further. Laxmi Nani and five of her companions decided to renounce lay life and be ordained as nuns. In 1934, she led her friends to Kushinagar, India and then to a nunnery in Arakan, Burma where they received ordination. Laxmi Nani was given the dharma name Dharmachari. They returned to Kathmandu and continued their work at Kindo Baha.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005). Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal. Harvard University Press. , 9780674019089. Page 47. Into exile Kindo Baha was turned into a center of Theravada Buddhism by the monks and nuns who were trained abroad. They conducted regular prayer meets, and the number of devotees coming to listen to their sermons kept increasing. As the crowds became larger, an intolerant government turned hostile. Spies hovered around Kindo Baha, and devotees had to face repeated police harassment. In 1944, the government took the extreme step of expelling all the monks in Kathmandu. A year later, the nuns were also banished. While the monks had to leave Nepal, the women were sent to Trishuli, a day's journey to the north of Kathmandu on the way to Tibet. Here too, the nuns gave sermons and taught the Dharma. Their activities were reported to the prime minister; and barely a month after their arrival in Trishuli, the police came and marched them back to Kathmandu. They were kept at the police station at Durbar Square where they were questioned. They were freed the next day.Tuladhar, Lochan Tara (2007). Dharmachari Guruma. Kathmandu: Nirvana Murti Vihara. . Pages 35-36. In 1946, a Sri Lankan goodwill mission visited Nepal and pleaded with the government on behalf of the banished monks. They were thus allowed to return and continue their activities unhindered. Page 224-225. Nirvana Murti Vihara Considering the crowded conditions at Kindo Baha, Dharmachari began work to establish a separate nunnery. She bought a piece of land nearby and raised funds to build a prayer hall and living quarters. In 1952, the nunnery with its centerpiece, a great statue of the reclining Buddha, was inaugurated. It is now known as Nirvana Murti Vihara. Page 225.

The episode also saw the return of UNIT and introduced their new scientific advisor, Kate Stewart (Jemma Redgrave), daughter of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.

Plot Amy and Rory adjust to normal life without travelling with the Eleventh Doctor. One day, billions of small black cubes appear across the globe. The Doctor arrives and he, Amy and Rory are taken to UNIT headquarters, where UNIT's head, Kate Stewart, explains that they have not been able to analyse the cubes' function. The Doctor waits with Amy and Rory for several days to monitor the situation, and gets to know Rory's father, Brian. The Doctor deems the cubes harmless and departs, but instructs Brian to keep watch. A year passes, with Amy and Rory periodically travelling with the Doctor. Brian, after observing Amy and Rory returning from one trip, asks the Doctor what has happened to his past companions. The Doctor tells some had met a sad fate but he will not let that happen to Amy or Rory. Humanity forgets about the cubes, using them as paperweights or other functions. A year after their arrival, the cubes start to activate, scanning information networks and act in self-defence. The Doctor fears this was a \\"slow invasion\\", and goes with Amy to UNIT while Rory and Brian help at the hospital. All the cubes are now showing the same countdown timer. When they reach zero, the cubes open, but appear empty; however, massive numbers of cardiac arrest cases are reported, killing about a third of humanity. Kate finds the boxes emitted a signal traced to seven sites across the globe, including the hospital Rory works at. At the hospital, Brian has been taken to a service lift by two orderlies. Rory follows them and discovers the back of it masks a portal to a ship in Earth's orbit. The Doctor and Amy arrive, discover the portal, and join Rory as he frees Brian. The Doctor is confronted by a hologram of a Shakri, who, according to Gallifreyan legend, were self- appointed \\"pest controllers\\" in the universe. The Shakri released the cubes to Earth to wipe out humanity and prepare to send out more, but the Doctor reverses the cubes' function, sending a signal that brings those harmed back to life. Feedback from this causes the ship to explode, though the four escape safely. As Earth recovers, the Doctor prepares to leave alone, but Brian insists he take Amy and Rory on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, asking \\"just bring them back safe\\". =Continuity= The Doctor tells Brian that a few of his previous companions have died; this is a reference to Sara Kingdom, Katarina, and Adric. At one point, the Doctor, Amy, and Rory relax and eat fish fingers and custard, a reference to \\"The Eleventh Hour\\". While this leads Brian to tell the Doctor to \\"just bring them back safe\\" at the end of this episode, the Doctor (and therefore Brian) will lose contact with Amy and Rory forever in the next episode. Amy and Rory's meal at the newly-opened Savoy hotel is ruined by \\"a Zygon spaceship parked under the Savoy\\"; the Zygons previously featured in the Fourth Doctor serial Terror of the Zygons (1975) and would appear again in the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013). The Tower of London had previously served as a UNIT base in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" and was mentioned as such in \\"The Sontaran Stratagem\\". The Doctor also mentions having a metallic dog that could hover; this refers to K-9, the robotic dog of the Fourth Doctor. Production The episode featured a cameo by Lord Sugar, filmed on the set of his show The Apprentice. The episode's title was originally reported as \\"Cubed\\", but was later announced as \\"The Power of Three\\". Chris Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episodes \\"42\\" (2007), \\"The Hungry Earth\\"/\\"Cold Blood\\" (2010), and the second episode of the seventh series, \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\". He was also a major contributor to the spinoff series Torchwood. \\"The Power of Three\\" is his second contribution to Doctor Who's seventh series, after \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\". Chibnall described \\"The Power of Three\\" as \\"a lovely big Earth invasion story\\" but different from the ones done before, as it focused on Amy and Rory's time with the Doctor and the impact of him on their lives. He stated it is told more from Amy and Rory's point of view than ever before, and is about celebrating them before they leave in the following episode. Chibnall's brief from showrunner Steven Moffat was to \\"live with the Doctor — The Man Who Came to Dinner, Doctor Who style.\\" Chibnall was also inspired by the story of the MSC Napoli. Matt Smith put disgust into the Doctor's remark concerning Twitter in the episode, reflecting his real-life decision to stay off the social network. Physicist Brian Cox also made a cameo appearance, theorising on the origin of the cubes. At Chibnall's request, \\"The Power of Three\\" sees the return of UNIT, which first appeared in The Invasion (1968) and became a regular feature during the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) era. The episode reveals that Kate Stewart is now running UNIT; she is the daughter of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and previously appeared in the Reeltime Pictures direct-to-video films Downtime and Dæmos Rising played by Beverley Cressman. Following the death of actor Nicholas Courtney in early 2011, the Doctor learned of the Brigadier's death in the sixth series finale \\"The Wedding of River Song\\". Matt Smith enjoyed working with Jemma Redgrave, describing her as \\"graceful, funny and charming and an absolute delight\\". The read-through of \\"The Power of Three\\" took place at Roath Lock, Cardiff on 27 April 2012. It was filmed by itself in the series' third production block. Because of this schedule, it was the final episode Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill filmed as Amy and Rory. Their last scene filmed together was getting into the TARDIS with the Doctor after saying farewell to Brian; when the doors closed Gillan, Darvill, and Smith hugged and started crying. Some exterior scenes at Amy and Rory's house were re-shot in June and July 2012, with Darvill briefly returning for the June re-shoot. Producer Marcus Wilson stated that a \\"hundred\\" individual cube props were made, with \\"many more\\" added with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Amy and the Doctor's conversation outside the Tower of London could not be filmed at the genuine location due to the London Olympics, so it was shot on studio in Cardiff and the live action was combined with other footage to create the illusion. The episode also features cameos from physicist Brian Cox and Lord Sugar, both of whom were long-time fans of the program. Sugar's cameo was in fact filmed on the set of The Apprentice, with director Douglas Mackinnon standing in for the person who was fired. Broadcast and reception \\"The Power of Three\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One and BBC One HD on 22 September 2012. Overnight ratings showed that it was watched by an audience of 5.49 million live. The final consolidated rating rose to 7.67 million viewers, making it the thirteenth most-watched programme of the week on British television, and the fifth highest rated on BBC One. The episode also received 1.3 million requests on BBC's online iPlayer, placing it fourth for the month on the site behind the first three episodes of the series. It also received an Appreciation Index of 87, considered \\"excellent\\". =Critical reception= \\"The Power of Three\\" received generally positive reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian stated he \\"bloody loved\\" the episode, calling it \\"a nostalgic run through all the best bits of the Russell T Davies era\\". However, he noted that it \\"also had the weaknesses of some of [Davies'] adventures – the ending was so underdeveloped that even a magic button couldn't explain it – but 'The Power of Three' was, in every sense, completely gorgeous\\". Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, praised the way the episode showed the companion's life outside the TARDIS and celebrated Amy and Rory, as well as the introduction of Kate Stewart and her connection with the Brigadier. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern described it as \\"beautifully made television\\" and welcomed Kate as a \\"wonderful addition\\". However, he stated that he did not \\"entirely buy the Doctor's solution\\". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded the episode as a B+. Despite noting the plot was \\"fairly standard\\" and \\"easily foiled\\", he wrote that the concept of the cubes and \\"slow invasion\\" was \\"a cleverly executed bit of business\\". IGN's Matt Risley rated \\"The Power of Three\\" a score of 8 out of 10, writing that the first three quarters were \\"simply brilliant\\" because of the emotion and humour. However, he criticised the \\"rushed resolution\\" and the lack of explanation for the aliens at the hospital. Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery gave the episode four out of five stars, describing it as \\"an emotional, fun and involving Doctor Who episode\\" despite the disappointing resolution. Russell Lewin of SFX gave the episode three and a half out of five stars, naming it as Chibnall's best Doctor Who episode. While he noted that \\"the ending was potentially always going to be a let down...And it is\\", there was \\"much to enjoy beforehand\\" such as UNIT and the humour. The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller gave it a score of two and a half out of five stars, feeling that it was \\"treading water\\" as a lead-in to the following finale. He described the first twenty minutes as \\"overpadded\\" and \\"heavy on exposition but little else\\", and pointed out the unexplained action at Rory's hospital. However, he enjoyed Amy and the Doctor's conversation and the \\"countdown element and the mystery of the cubes\\", but found the explanation unoriginal and the conclusion too easy.

It is the last in the first block of episodes in the seventh series, followed by the 2012 Christmas special \\"The Snowmen\\". The episode was written by head writer Steven Moffat and directed by Nick Hurran. In the episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) takes his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and her husband Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) to Central Park. While Rory goes to get coffee, recurring monsters the Weeping Angels send Rory back to 1938, where he is reunited with River Song (Alex Kingston), Amy and Rory's daughter. Amy and the Doctor attempt to rescue Rory, but the Doctor realises along the way that this adventure will be his last with Amy and Rory. Actors Gillan and Darvill both departed the series during this episode. Amy's departure from the series was a compromise between Gillan and Moffat. Moffat wrote several endings and situations for the couple, eventually deciding to incorporate the Weeping Angels. Despite being Amy and Rory's last episode, it was not the last episode Gillan and Darvill filmed. Production took place in April 2012, with location filming in Wales and a small crew filming in the United States in Central Park. \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" was watched by 7.82 million viewers in the UK and received positive reviews, though critics noted some plot holes and other logical issues. Plot In 2012, the Eleventh Doctor, Amy, and Rory enjoy a picnic in Central Park. The Doctor reads a novel about a 1930s detective named Melody Malone. Rory is sent to 1938 by a cherub Weeping Angel and meets River Song, who wrote Melody Malone. The Doctor and Amy find Rory written into the Melody Malone novel and attempt to take the TARDIS to 1938, but the TARDIS struggles to get there. Cherub angels as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience. The Weeping Angel collector Grayle captures River and Rory. He locks Rory in the cellar with several cherub Weeping Angels, while he has a Weeping Angel grab River by the wrist while he interrogates her. River is able to use her vortex manipulator to allow the TARDIS to arrive. Amy, knowing River wrote the book to help them, uses it to look for Rory. River breaks her wrist to free herself. Amy finds the cellar empty and the Doctor locates Rory at an apartment building nearby. Rory enters an apartment with an elderly version of himself in bed, who dies without having seen Amy for many years. The Doctor deduces that the Weeping Angels have been using the building as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate and flee to the roof. Amy and Rory jump off the roof, creating a paradox that destroys the building and the Weeping Angels. The Doctor, River, Amy and Rory find themselves near the TARDIS in a graveyard in 2012. Rory catches sight of a gravestone with his name on it. He is then sent into the past by a Weeping Angel who had survived the paradox. The Doctor is unable to go back to get him, due to the paradox. Despite the Doctor urging her not to do so, Amy allows herself to be touched by the Weeping Angel in the hope of being with Rory. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the gravestone. River declines to travel with the Doctor, but insists he should not travel alone. Unsuccessfully motivating him, River tells the Doctor she will ask Amy to write an afterword in the novel. The Doctor recovers the last page of the book he had torn out earlier, where Amy wrote to him, encouraging him to not travel alone. As a final request from Amy, the Doctor goes back to her garden in 1996, the morning after young Amelia Pond had waited for him (\\"The Eleventh Hour\\"), to tell her about her future adventures. =Continuity= Images from \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" of a young Amelia Pond going to the garden and awaiting the Doctor are shown at the episode's conclusion. Amy's afterword contains several references to her adventures with the Doctor: fighting pirates (\\"The Curse of the Black Spot\\"); falling in love with \\"a man who will wait two thousand years to keep her safe\\" (\\"The Big Bang\\"); giving hope to \\"the greatest painter who ever lived\\" (\\"Vincent and the Doctor\\"); and saving \\"a whale in outer space.\\" (\\"The Beast Below\\") Production Matt Smith during filming of the episode in Central Park, New York, part of the final scene where the Doctor reads Amy Pond's afterword. In December 2011, Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat announced that Amy and Rory would leave in the seventh series in \\"heartbreaking\\" circumstances. Amy's exit was a mutual decision between Moffat and Amy's actor Karen Gillan. Gillan stated that she wanted to go \\"on a high when the character was at her prime\\" and to \\"go with everything that she wants\\". She wanted her character to have a final ending, and ruled out returning to the show in the future as she felt it would take away from the impact of her final scene. Moffat stated he felt \\"tremendous pressure\\" writing Amy and Rory's ending. He later revealed that he \\"completely changed\\" the ending as he was writing it, feeling the emphasis was wrong. During rewrites Moffat went back and forth deciding whether or not Amy and Rory should live or die. He eventually decided that death would complement the storyline involving the \\"old, sentimental\\" and \\"dangerous\\" characterisation of the Doctor. At one point he considered making the story that involved the Daleks, but felt the Weeping Angels were a \\"better fit\\". Moffat was also interested in coming up with a new form for the Angels, and so he introduced the cherubs. He also said that since the Angels had debuted in \\"Blink\\", fans had suggested that the Statue of Liberty could be a Weeping Angel. Gillan refused to read the script for a few weeks after she received it because she \\"didn't want to make it real\\". She said in an interview, \\"I literally couldn't read it without crying. It was the most highly-charged read-through I've ever experienced. But I couldn't have asked for a better exit. I don't think it'll be what people expect.\\" A scene written by Chris Chibnall showing how Rory's father Brian (Mark Williams) became aware of Amy and Rory's fate did not make it into production. However, on 12 October 2012, the BBC released an animated storyboard entitled \\"P.S.\\" that depicted the scene with narration by Arthur Darvill. It takes place one week later in Brian's timeline after \\"The Power of Three\\" when a man named Anthony delivers him a letter from Rory, telling him that they will never return and that Anthony is the son they adopted in 1946. The scene was written to be a DVD extra, and was not filmed due to time constraints. The read-through for \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" took place in the Upper Boat Studios on 23 March 2012, alongside that for the episode \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\". The final episode Gillan and Darvill shot as Amy and Rory was actually the previous episode, \\"The Power of Three\\". Nevertheless, Gillan and Matt Smith got very emotional filming the final graveyard scene. Amy and Rory's scene on the rooftop was filmed in a car park in Cardiff, with a greenscreen standing in for the New York skyline. To create the effect of the two plunging down, Gillan and Darvill were suspended upside-down by wires and raised and lowered. Much of the episode was filmed in Central Park in New York City in April 2012. The filming was attended by thousands of American fans, which surprised the cast and crew. Other scenes were shot at night in the city, as well as by the East River in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the Tudor City apartment complex. Moffat was in New York City when he came up with the story, and thought it was appropriate for the Weeping Angels. He described the city as \\"a different backdrop\\" to shoot a Doctor Who story in, and made use of its architecture. Fellow executive producer Caroline Skinner felt that the location \\"has such scale and romance\\" which \\"[gave] the episode a real atmosphere and a very different tone for Doctor Who\\". The week spent filming in the city was done by a \\"small unit by American standards\\" according to producer Marcus Wilson. They did not take any props of Angels or the TARDIS, which were instead added in post-production. Filming for the episode also occurred at a cemetery in Llanelli. During post-production, the New York skyline was inserted into the cemetery scenes. Gillan insisted on reading Amy's afterword in the Melody Malone book to Smith when his reaction was filmed. They were not expecting it to be in front of a crowd in Central Park, and Smith said he had to \\"treat this like a play\\". Because the content was so secret, Gillan had to read very quietly and Smith could not hold the real page because a spectator might take a picture of it. Gillan found that she only had one page of the script, and had to improvise the rest. The Doctor Who logo in the title sequence featured a texture showing the Statue of Liberty's crown, in keeping with the varied \\"blockbuster\\" themes for each of the opening five episodes of the series. The beginning of the episode features the song \\"Englishman in New York\\" by Sting. On 4 October 2012, BBC Books released the ebook The Angel's Kiss: A Melody Malone Mystery, a prequel to the story that the Doctor was reading in the episode. Broadcast and reception \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2012 on BBC One, and on the same date in the United States on BBC America. Overnight ratings showed that it was watched by 5.9 million viewers live, an increase of 400,000 from the previous week. The final consolidated rating rose to 7.82 million viewers, making it the thirteenth most-watched programme of the week on British television. The episode also received 0.92 million requests on BBC's online iPlayer, placing it seventh for the month on the site despite only being available for a few days. It also received an Appreciation Index of 88, the second highest of the series behind \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" (89). =Critical reception= The episode received positive reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian gave a positive review, writing, \\"This was a fitting end to a golden era, and bravo to Steven Moffat for telling such an involving, emotional story with such style\\". He also praised the concept of the cherubs and the Angels in New York. However, he noted that he was \\"flummoxed\\" as to where in River's timeline the episode took place. The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller gave it five out of five stars, concluding \\"'The Angels Take Manhattan' brought this mini-run of the series to a close with easily the best episode of the five: a powerful, taut, compelling, filmic, emotionally punchy affair which re-established the Angels as one of the standout monsters of the series and gave Amy Pond a fine send off\\". While he praised the four actors he felt Gillan was the star, and noted that Rory did not \\"get any sort of send- off\\". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" a grade of A, attributing its success to \\"the way it does double duty as a twist adventure and a highly emotional story of farewells\\". Sam Wollaston, also writing for The Guardian, wrote positively of the scare factor in the episode, as well as the sadness. Neela Debnath of The Independent described it as a \\"wonderful swansong to the duo\\" and particularly praised the \\"stylish\\" cinematography and sense of danger. However, she considered the \\"only flaw\\" to be \\"the rule that time cannot be changed if one knows what is going to happen ... though it is probably best not to question the timey wimey side of things and just accept it and enjoy the adventure\\". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10, writing that it \\"stood strong as a heartfelt, emotional end for the TARDIS' longest serving companions (since the show's noughties' return at least), and the best episode of the season thus far\\". Risley also praised the three leads, though he said that the episode \\"left a few nitpicky questions\\". Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery gave \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" five out of five stars, despite noting \\"plotholes ... and slightly- too-convenient plot contrivances\\" and that Rory did not get a heroic exit. Jeffery particularly praised the build-up to Amy and Rory's departure as well as the \\"superb production design\\". Dave Golder of SFX awarded the episode four out of five stars, believing that the \\"bittersweet exit\\" of the Ponds distracted the viewer from various narrative problems, such as the Statue of Liberty.

The Huffington Post writer Maureen Ryan was more critical of the episode, worrying that the BBC's international promotion of the show was to the detriment of the quality of the writing. She felt that Amy deserved a better exit and \\"was crowded out by the distracting presence of River Song and by the fact that Rory was the one to make the essential choices first\\". She also personally disliked the \\"timey-wimey\\" devices, and commented that the \\"big and operatic tone the director was clearly going for clashed with the mood of film noir\\" and that the Angels \\"felt less menacing\\" and the \\"pace was a little too frantic\\".

(usually denominated as Piacenza Calcio) has covered 93 years of the football from the club based in Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna. It was an Italian association football club founded in 1919. In 2012 the club was declared bankrupt and the team was disbanded. A successor, Piacenza Calcio 1919, former known as Lupa Piacenza and A.C.D. LibertaSpes, had licensed to the brand of the club since 2012. The club won the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1986. The highest they have ever finished in their home league is 12th in Serie A, which they have achieved twice in 1997/1998 and 2001/2002. They spent much of their history in the lower divisions, suffering relegation in four of their first six Serie B seasons. They first reaching Serie A in the early nineties, and have been relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione. Piacenza has been known in the past for its strong reluctance to use foreign players, using a team made up exclusively of Italians for most of its Serie A seasons. From 1919 to 2012 = Foundation = From the late 19th century football had begun gain popularity in Piacenza and was introduced into the college system along with cycling, gymnastics, archery and other sports. The spark that helped ignite football in the city was a student tournament in 1908. The football competition was played out between teams from various cities, and the team from Collegio Morigi from Piacenza were the victors. The early football played in the city was limited to \\"friendlies\\" until Piacenza Calcio was founded in 1919 with the first club president as Giovanni Dosi. Dosi was an ambitious manager, taking control of every social, technical and administrative aspect of the club, with the sole focus at bringing the club into the national championship under the FIGC. In their first season, the club played 12 games. Their opponents included; Parma, Reggiana, Spal, and prominent local side Bologna. The season was a great start for Piacenza, who only lost one game (1–0 to Bologna) gaining promotion to Prima Categoria. The first championship winning squad included the players Fontana, Armani, Meani, Sala I, Marelli, Paleari, Cella, Galimberti, Bossola, Giiumanini, Boselli, Ronchetti, Ventura, Sala II, Raina, Ziliani I, Ziliani II, Avogadri, Sala III and Antonini. After spending much of the club's early life in the regional leagues, they entered into Serie C for the 1935–36 season, coming close to gaining promotion into Serie B during 1938 but lost out to Fanfulla. =Post-World War= After World War II, Piacenza competed in Serie B for the first time, competing there for two seasons before falling back down to Serie C in 1948. During 1952 for the second time the club was close to promotion but lost out again, this time to Cagliari. The club were punished for illicit sportsmanship in 1956 and were relegated to Serie D. This proved to be quite a heavy blow for the club as they would continue to yo-yo between Serie C and D until 1964. Piacenza finally returned to Serie B in 1969, under coach Tino Molina and president Vincenzo Romagnoli. =1970s and 1980s= Piacenza's history until recent times was mostly undistinguished, with brief spells in Serie B in the 1940s and further spells in 1969–70, 1975–76 and 1987–88 to 1988–89. =Between Serie A and Serie B= Promotion in 1991 saw a rise in the side's fortunes under coach Gigi Cagni with the club promoted to Serie A for the first time in 1993. The 1993 side contained players such as midfielder Daniele Moretti, winger Francesco Turrini and forward Giampietro Piovani. They spent 1993–94 holding their own in mid-table and were on the fringes of a place in the UEFA Cup, but were unfortunate to be relegated on the final day. The club wisely chose to retain Cagni and most of his squad, and they would achieve promotion as Serie B champions in 1995. The following five years saw the club win many supporters with its all-Italian lineup and successful battles against relegation. In 1997 the club acquired legendary hard man defender Pietro Vierchowod. Despite his advancing years, Vierchowod proved an outstanding purchase, more than holding his own in defence and even scoring decisive goals in the relegation battle. Relegation in 2000 was followed by an instant return to Serie A for two years with outstanding form shown by players like midfielder Enzo Maresca. The club has since remained in Serie B without threatening to mount a promotion challenge. On the final day of the 2006–07 Serie B season, the team needed a victory to force a Serie B promotion playoff, but were held to a draw, and thus the top 3 gained automatic promotion. The club profited in the player sale by selling Daniele Cacia (50% €4.5 million), Hugo Campagnaro in summer 2007, and again in summer 2008 from Houssine Kharja and re-selling Cacia (€0.2 million net) =2010-11: Relegation to Prima Divisione= However following a poor 2010-11 Serie B season, Piacenza found themselves in a relegation playoff against Albinoleffe which they lost due to Albinoleffe's higher league position. The club also had to finance the club with financial trick, which Matteo Colombi and Andrea Lussardi were sold to Internazionale but in swap deal, the time gap between receiving (booking) profit and amortize transfer fee made 2009–10 accounts was boosted for €3 million and the bought back action made true amortization cost in 2010–11 season was unchanged, however in 2011–12 accounts the club had to book around €750,000 (€3M divided by 4-year contract )amortization cost on Colombi and Lussardi. = 2012: Final bankruptcy after relegation = On 22 March 2012 Piacenza Calcio in strong financial difficulty was declared bankrupt by the court of Piacenza. In this season it was ranked 15th and relegated from Lega Pro Prima Divisione to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione after play-out. On 19 June 2012 the club was finally declared bankrupt and the team was disbanded. = Colors and badge = The team's colors were red and white, prompting one of the team's nicknames, the Biancorossi.

His mother worked for women's suffrage and served as president of the Women's Christian Temperance Union.

The first parent trigger law was passed by the California legislature in January 2010. Similar laws have been adopted subsequently by Louisiana, Mississippi, Connecticut, Texas, Indiana and Ohio. The law has been invoked by parents in the Compton, Adelanto, Anaheim, and LAUSD school districts of California. Most recently in California, parents in 20th Street Elementary School and Palm Lane Elementary School have used the parent trigger law. As a result of the parent trigger campaign, 20th Street Elementary School is now one of the most improved schools in all of LAUSD. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa wrote about the success of the 20th Street parent trigger in the Wall Street Journal.  History  Parent trigger laws were first introduced by the Los Angeles Parents Union (LAPU), founded in 2006 by Green Dot Public Schools, a charter school organization. Green Dot, led by Steve Barr, also conducted campaigns in Watts—using a pre- existing law for school transformation based on petitions from teachers—to transform public schools into charter schools. In May 2009, Green Dot formed Parent Revolution, led by Ben Austin who was a former Clinton White House Staffer and Los Angeles Deputy Mayor. Austin formulated the idea for the parent trigger law and worked with Parent Revolutions staffer Shirley Ford to lobby for its passage. The laws envisioned would allow 51% of parents to form a Parent Union with control over their school and the ability to transform it using one of President Obama's four school turnaround options. Speaking at a meeting organized by Green Dot, LA mayor Antonio Villaraigosa expressed support for the proposed laws, arguing that if teachers can have a union parents should also be able to organize and unionize. United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) criticized Green Dot and the mayor for attempted union busting, and the state teachers union president referred to parent trigger as a \\"Lynch mob\\" provision. In November 2009, the Los Angeles Unified School District passed parent trigger rules stating that a majority of parents or future parents could transfer a school to outside management. The decision won praise from Parents Revolution and criticism from UTLA. However, some charter operators objected to rules that required charter schools to include neighborhood students and to employ custodial services from the district. Parent Revolution, Mayor Villaraigosa, and others urged the state to pass similar laws. In January 2010, the California legislature passed by one vote in both houses a \\"Parent Empowerment\\" law (Article 3 of SBX54, introduced by Senator Gloria J. Romero and Senator Bob Huff and signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger), becoming the only state in the nation with a parent trigger law. The law's passage, just before a federal deadline on January 19, allowed California to compete for $700 million in President Obama's Race to the Top initiative (which it did not ultimately receive) by complying with a Race to the Top requirement that test scores be used to evaluate teachers. SBX54 also includes an \\"open enrollment\\" provision, allowing students in underperforming schools to apply for admission at any other school. Parent Revolution—with a $1 million annual budget funded by the Gates Foundation, the Walton Family Foundation, the Wasserman Foundation, the Broad Foundation, and the Hewlett Foundation—announced intentions to seek parent trigger actions across California. Two efforts have been conducted thus far. Similar parent trigger laws have been proposed in more than 20 states, and been enacted in Mississippi, Texas, Indiana, and Louisiana. A variation on the law, which uses parents' councils, was passed in Connecticut. Ohio has established a pilot version of the law which applies only to the Columbus City Schools. One parent trigger law was defeated in Florida. Public advocates for parent trigger laws, besides Parent Revolution, include The US Conference of Mayors, Stand for Children, and Michelle Rhee. The New York Times reported in 2010 that Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel support parent trigger laws. Mitt Romney supports it.  Provisions  California's trigger law applies to schools with an Academic Performance Index score of below 800. Parents of children attending these schools may petition for one or more of four options:Patrick Range McDonald, \\"California's Parent Trigger: How McKinley in Compton became the first school taken over by parents under a radical new law ,\\" L.A. Weekly, December 9, 2010. * Convert the school into a charter * Replace the old staff and make budget decisions * Dismiss the principal * Dissolve the school and relocate the students to other schools. *Collect the signatures and use them as leverage to bargain. If at least half of the school's parents sign a petition, the school district must implement the policy they choose. The aggregate group of parents whose children are likely to attend a school in the future have, independently, the same power.  Implementation  As of May 2013, at least three school districts have been petitioned to implement a trigger: Compton Unified School District, Adelanto School District, and the Los Angeles Unified School District. =McKinley Elementary School, Compton, CA= In Compton, Parent Revolution collected parent signatures to transfer administration of McKinley Elementary School to Celerity Education Group, a charter operator. Paid staffers were joined by 15 parent volunteers who formed a group called McKinley Parents for Change. The drive yielded signatures representing 61% of McKinley families. Compton Unified School District, along with some unsatisfied parents, challenged the petition, arguing that Parent Revolution had given parents no choice in how to change the school (deciding beforehand on a charter school managed by Celerity) and questioning the validity of the signatures produced by the group. Parents criticized Parents Revolution, McKinley Elementary, and teachers for harassing them and pushing their own agendas during the conflict. Between 50 and 60 parents revoked their signatures after discovering what the petition was for, stating that Parent Revolution had misled them about its effects. Even though the parent trigger law allowed undocumented parents to sign the petition, the school district demanded photographic identification to back up the parent signatures on the petition; Parent Revolution sued claiming Compton was attempting to intimidate undocumented parents and won an injunction preventing them from requiring official identification to verify a parent trigger petition. Ultimately, the parent trigger at McKinley was not enacted. Celerity opened a charter school at the Church of the Redeemer two blocks away. Predictions that the new charter school would undermine McKinley were disproven when most of the new school's students came from elsewhere. =Desert Trails Elementary, Adelanto, CA= Parent Revolution's second attempt at a parent trigger occurred in Adelanto, CA, at Desert Trails Elementary, then of the Adelanto Elementary School District. With the assistance of twelve parent volunteers, the group collected signatures for a petition to transform their failing school, Desert Trails Elementary. Similar disputes arose, with blame assigned to both sides—the core issue being the validity of the signatures on the petition. These signatures represented 70% of the school's 666 students. However, support for the parent trigger action dropped below the required 50% when the district claimed that 90 parents rescinded their signatures. The Adelanto school board initially rejected the petition, calling too many of the signatures invalid. In July 2012, a California Superior Court decision overruled the board in favor of the petition, stating that the state law did not allow parents to revoke their signatures. The school board rejected this plan also, saying there was not time to create a new school before September 2012, and instead creating an advisory committee called the Alternative Governance Board. This body would consist of three parents, three teachers, two representatives of the superintendent, and a community member. According to many, this action constituted open defiance of the court's decision. The parents challenged the decision again in court,California 'Parent-Trigger' Effort Thrown Back Into Turmoil, Education Week. raising the legal question of whether the law gives the school or the parents the final authority over implementing reforms.As school starts, new questions in Adelanto charter fight, LA Times. As litigation continued into the 2012 school year, the pro-trigger parents (who formed a group called the Desert Trails Parents Union) have solicited proposals for new schools from several charter operators. In July 2013, the courts ordered Desert Trails Elementary School to be replaced with Desert Trails Preparatory Academy, operated by the same Charter School administration that runs the LaVerne Preparatory Academy in Hesperia, CA. Adelanto Elementary School District continued to maintain some control over the school, as the courts ordered a provisional charter agreement at the school's beginning due to the Parent Trigger Law. In December 2015, AESD revoked the school's charter for failing to address the concerns that the Board of Trustees had for the campus. DTPA denied the allegations and responded to the decision that the District is making retaliatory inquiries and accusations that have nothing to do with student progress. In March 2016 the San Bernardino County Board of Education voted to hand authority over the charter school to the county government in a 3-2 vote.Yarbrough, Beau. \\"Parent Trigger charter school switches from Adelanto to county school.\\" San Bernardino Sun.

Although continuing litigation concerning ownership of the property is unresolved, this decision ended AESD's involvement with the campus beginning with the 2016-17 School Year. Beau Yarbrough of the San Bernardino Sun wrote that it became \\"difficult to compare apples to apples between Desert Trails Elementary and how Desert Trails Prep is doing today\\" because around the time Desert Trails was converted, the State of California changed its standardized testing to meet the Common Core requirements.Yarbrough, Beau. \\"Adelanto will not renew charter for Desert Trails parent trigger school.\\" San Bernardino Sun.

Retrieved on May 8, 2016. =West Athens Elementary School, Los Angeles, CA= Unhappy about the school’s culture of low expectations, student safety, and low academic outputs, parents at West Athens Elementary School formed their own parent chapter and began to organize around the Parent Empowerment Act. Leveraging the law, the parents eventually suspended their parent petition process when the District agreed to hold negotiations with the parent chapter. Eventually, the parents and the LA Unified School District struck a deal to spend an additional $300,000 on personnel at the school, including hiring a full-time school psychiatrist and several aides. The agreement calls on the district to do a better job including parents in the school’s day-to-day operations, make the school safer and cleaner, create better lines of communication between teachers and parents and provide additional training for teachers and staff, all to create a school culture of high expectations for the campus. =Lennox Middle School, Los Angeles, CA= Parents organized to discuss ways to improve the school for their students, and held stakeholder meetings with teachers and district leaders. Because of the threat of the Parent Empowerment Act, parents were able to transform their campus without gathering a petition. The District agreed to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment process. As a result of the needs assessment, the District implemented a turnaround plan that has community support, to include a new principal, more electives for ELL students, more freedom for teachers to teach creatively, and a strong college-going culture. Parents maintained support of the Superintendent and the school leadership and work in partnership with the school.https://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/23/local/la-me-0823-lennox- parents-20130823 =Padres Revolucionarios de Haddon= Parents organized because students did not feel safe, motivated or inspired at the school. Despite their efforts to solicit change before forming a parent union, they were met with resistance by the District. After obtaining a majority of parent signatures, the parents began to see progress within the school and district toward reform, which led the parent union to pause their effort and await the results of a new teacher-led effort. The parent union eventually ended their petition campaign after the teachers formally adopted a school transformation plan that allows teachers to have more control over their school and allows them to better meet the needs of their students. The parents continue to collaborate with school officials and teachers to make the reform plan a success. =Weigand Parents United= Following 15 years of low-performing academic results, and one unsuccessful effort to collaborate with teachers to gather petitions calling for key improvements for the school and for the principal to be replaced before the enactment of the Parent Empowerment Act, parents organized under the new law. The parents actively supported the teachers, but wanted to see a new leader to lead the students to academic success. The strong majority of parents successfully brought in a new principal. The parents and the community now work collaboratively with the District. =24th Street Elementary= Parents had tried for years to organize change with the District. They eventually organized into a Parent Union and gathered signatures from 69% of parents, empowering them to solicit proposals from both District and charter applications to transform the school. The parents union negotiated a historic partnership between the district and a charter school where they would run the campus collaboratively, with the district running the K-4 program (with a reform union contract) and a charter school that was co-located on the campus operates the new 5-8 program. The parents also negotiated a new pre-K program, run by the District, as well as a presence on the principal and teacher hiring committees. A strong District- charter collaboration now shapes the school and new leadership has created a new culture.  Criticism  Groups such as the Center for Teacher Quality and Fund Education Now have described the campaign for parent trigger laws as astroturfing—a fake popular movement which is actually originated by a wealthy elite. Other groups also focused on reforming public school education, such as the Center for Education Reform, point out that teachers' unions regularly spend substantial sums of money defeating Parental Choice, charter schools, tuition vouchers and other education reforms—and that \\"astroturfing\\" isn't limited to any one side in education debates. In the case of Parent Revolution, critics point to sponsorship by the Green Dot charter company. Related arguments have been directed at the 2012 film Won't Back Down, which promotes parent trigger laws. Won't Back Down was created by Philip Anschutz's Walden Media and supported by Walmart and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). The documentary We the Parents is a non-fiction version for comparison. Critics have echoed union claims that a primary goal of the campaign is to circumvent union protections for public school teachers. Some parents and community leaders in Compton criticized Parent Revolution for misleading petitioners about the nature of parent trigger laws. They also cited Parent Revolution's lack of transparency and apparently top-down organization. A speech from Mayor Villaraigosa in favor of a parent trigger for McKinley Elementary triggered demonstrations, with signs reading \\"Our Kids Are Not for Sale\\" and chants of \\"No charter school!\\" Others noted that McKinley's test scores were already improving and suggested that Parent Revolution chose the school cynically in order to capture its positive results. Caroline Grannan of Parents Across America argues that the petitions have been divisive among parents in the districts where they were attempted.

He studied in the University of Bologna and achieved a doctorate in law. Paul returned to Hungary with a library worthing 1,000 marks, but his books were annihilated in the course of a civil war in 1276. His superiors, including King Ladislaus IV of Hungary often sent him to Rome in order to represent their interests at the Holy See. Although he administered the vacant see of Pécs from 1287, he was only consecrated bishop in 1293. Initially, he supported King Andrew III of Hungary, but after the king's death he joined Prince Charles of Naples, the claimant supported by Pope Benedict VIII to the Hungarian throne. Life Paul was born in a family whose ancestral lands were located in Gömör County. His two uncles, Paul and Benedict were employed in the retinue of Maria Laskarina, wife of Béla IV of Hungary. His namesake uncle seems to have paved the way for Paul to the royal court. It was also his uncle (then bishop of Veszprém) who introduced Paul to the cathedral chapter of his see by appointing him archdeacon of Somogy County. The income of this prebend enabled Paul to finance his studies in the University of Bologna from 1269 to 1273. He was later styled legum doctor, suggesting that he did not restricted his studies to canon law, but also got a degree in Roman law. gens Balog Although Paul only returned to Hungary a year after his uncle's death, he was appointed the provost of the cathedral chapter of Veszprém in 1275 at the latest. However, Veszprém was taken and pillaged by the troops of Palatine Peter Csák, enemy of Bishop Peter Kőszegi of Veszprém in 1276. According to Paul's account, his own damages amounted to around 4,000 marks, including the loss of his books. In short time Paul received a prebend in the cathedral chapter of Esztergom. However, at that time the canons of Esztergom were divided among the partisans of Peter Kőszegi and his opponent, Nicholas Kán, thus both prelates were elected archbishop. Peter Kőszegi sent Paul to Rome in order to receive papal support for his case, but the pope declared the see of Esztergom vacant and ordered a new election in June 1278. A royal charter of 1286 reveals that King Ladislaus IV also sent Paul several times to Rome. In addition, Paul served Elizabeth of Sicily, wife of Ladislaus IV, as her chancellor at least from 1281. Lodomer, archbishop of Esztergom promoted Paul to the provostship of the cathedral chapter of his see in 1287, and also entrusted him with the administration of the vacant bishopric of Pécs. Although he governed the diocese from Esztergom, the cathedral chapter of Pécs started again issuing official documents after a break of nearly 20 years. Paul was consecrated bishop of Pécs in the first half of 1293. He soon assisted Tomasina Morosini, mother of King Andrew III in taking Dunaszekcső, a fortress held by the king's enemy, Mizse, the former Palatine. The queen mother also employed Bishop Paul as her chancellor from 1295 at the latest. Paul was present in Vienna at the engagement of King Andrew III's daughter, Elizabeth, to Wenceslaus, the heir apparent to the crown of Bohemia in 1298, which proves that he remained faithful to King Andrew III in that chaotic period. Pécs was taken and pillaged around 1300 by Heyze, the brother of the monarch's one-time opponent, Mizse. Bishop Paul joined the party of Charles, the Neapolitan claimant to the throne of Hungary against the Czech Wenceslaus after the death of King Andrew III in 1301. His choice was in line with the policy adopted by the Holy See in the conflict for the Holy Crown of Hungary. Paul participated at the synod of the Hungarian prelates convoked by the papal legate, Cardinal Nicholas Boccasini. Additionally, he often advised the papal legate on legal issues concerning customary law in the Kingdom of Hungary. He also took part in the unsuccessful siege of Buda in September 1302 by Charles of Naples. Paul seems to have been the bishop of Pécs who set up the bishop's chapel consisting of the clerics directly serving him. He appointed the provost of Pécs to the head of this new diocesan body, suggesting that he maintained a good relationship with the cathedral chapter at his see. He organized for the first time a procession in Pécs against tempest and thunderbolt on the day following the Feast of Corpus Christi. Bishop Paul was last mentioned in August 1304, but he died in the first half of 1306 according to the records on his successor's election. References * Koszta, László (2009).

His dissertation entitled \\"The Boatbuilding Sequence in the Gilgamesh Epic and the Sewn Boat Relation\\" examines and reinterprets the construction of the Ark of the Deluge in light of archaeological and ethnographic evidence in Arabia, Africa, and India. The focus of this work is that the ark as depicted in the epic was of sewn construction, a determination that pushes back the technology to the 13th century B.C. A popular article on this was the cover feature for Biblical Archaeology Review in 2005. Pedersen is currently the principal investigator for nautical archaeology projects in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. He has been a team member of the excavation of the Bronze Age shipwreck at Uluburun, Turkey; served as daily field director for the 1991 excavation of a 17th-century wreck at Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic under USD Anthropology Associate Professor Jerome Lynn Hall; surveyed underwater in Bahrain in 1993; excavated a 1500-year-old shipwreck at Black Assarca Island, Eritrea; surveyed shipwrecks off New York's Long Island, and served as an Associate Director of India's Kadakkarapally Boat Project, which involved a thousand-year-old ship found under a coconut grove in Kerala. In 2004 he conducted an underwater survey at Tell el-Burak in Lebanon, and in 2007 in the waters off the early Bronze Age tell at Fadous-Kfarabida for the American University of Beirut. Pedersen has been a research associate with the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, based at Texas A&M; University, since 1992. In 2012, Pedersen along with colleagues from Philipps-Universität Marburg in Germany began a multi-year archaeological survey Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast to locate and document shipwrecks and ancient harbors. Also in the same year he conducted a re-assessment of the archaeological site in Beirut, Lebanon known as the \\"Venus Towers Site,\\" which was claimed by a local activist group to be a Phoenician port. Pedersen’s study refuted that determination as no evidence was found to support the maritime interpretation of the site, and that specific features within the site demonstrated the impossibility of the use of the place for ships. In 2014, Pedersen founded the Red Sea Institute for Anthropological Research. http://www.redseainstitute.org/ In addition to his doctorate, Pedersen holds a BA in Anthropology and Linguistics from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and an MA in Anthropology/Nautical Archaeology from Texas A&M; University. = References = The Red Sea Institute for Anthropological Research. http://www.redseainstitute.org/ Interview: by Carsten Bergmann of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.

Arranged around a central courtyard, the individual buildings have been built to a homogeneous design, all with yellow-washed facades, green doors and gates, white window frames and red tile roofs, but they have in fact been accumulated over an extended period of time, mainly between 1740 and 1925. They also integrate visually and physically with the adjacent Civiletatens Materialgård, a storage facility associated with the royal palaces, and the Royal Horse Guards Barracks, together forming an area of low, yellow buildings surrounded on three sides by Frederiksholm Canal, Bryghusgade and Vester Voldgade. The International Federation for Housing and Planning maintains an office at 30 Frederiksholms Kanal. History Frederiksholm Canal was dug in 1681 and a new military storage facility, Fæstningens Materialgård, was established as a replacement of its predecessor in Rigensgade. None of these original buildings exist today. Layout and architecture Magnolia trees in the courtyard The complex consists of four building volumes and two small sheds, interconnected by walls and surrounding a large courtyard. The main entrance to the area is through a gate on the corner of Frederiksholms Kanal and Bryghusgade. The courtyard contains a small garden with Magnolia trees and roses. The buildings were listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1952 and the listing was extended to also include the courtyard environment with its original paving. =The Storage Keeper's House= The Storage Keeper's House seen from the courtyard The oldest building which still exists today is the Storage Keeper's House (Materialforvalterboligen) from 1740, located immediately to the right of the main gate and facing the canal. The architect is not known but may have been Johan Cornelius Krieger. The building is nine bays wide and has a red mansard roof with a large wall dormer both on its front and rear sides. The interiors combine elements from the Baroque, Empire and Neoclassicism. The ground floor originally served representative purposes and is richly decorated. The first floor served as a residence and is built to a more simple design. The building still has its original window frames, doors, shutters and panelling. =Bryghusgade Wing= On the other side of the main entrance, along Bryghusgade, lies a building known as the Storage Building (Magasinbygningen). It was originally built in 1768 but has later been extended twice and the interiors have been altered. The storage building along Vester Voldgade seen from the courtyard =Vester Voldgade Wing= The 45-bay long half-timbered building on the rear side of the complex was built in 1748 along the city's West Rampart, now Vester Voldgade. The main facade of the building faces the courtyard where two dormers, originally with hoists, break up the monotony of the large tile roof. It was originally used for storage of materials and also contained stables in its eastern end. =Overhang Building= Originally two individual structures, separated by a pit for production of slaked lime, the Overhang Buildings (Halvtagsbygningen) were constructed in 1819 along the boundary to Civiletatens Materialgård, the name referring to the large overhang of their skillion roofs. The building to the south was a storage shed and the building to the north contained a workshop. In 1925 they were connected to form one large building. A dormer window almost the full length of the building was added in the 1970s. Realdania renovation Fæstningens Materialgård was acquired by the Realdania foundation in 2007. The complex has subsequently been subject to a demonstration project targeted at investigating possibilities of carrying out and optimizing energy-saving renovations of listed buildings without compromising their architectural and historical qualities. The renovation was completed in 2012 when the buildings were converted into office space. It required large technical installations which have been placed in a disused underground bunker beneath the couthyard. IFHP Copenhagen office The International Federation for Housing and Planning which collaborates with Realdania opened an office at 30 Frederiksholms Kanal in 2012. It is headed by CEO Anette Galskjøt.http://www.ifhp.org/news/ifhp- appoints-new-ceo Literature * Kleis, Birgitte and Christian Varming, Jens: Fæstningens Materialgård.

He was High Hofmeister of Bohemia from 1514 to 1523Hofmeister and from 1526, he was governor of Bohemia. He was considered one of the richest magnates in Bohemia.  Life  Wall decoration in Pardubice Castle His parents were William II of Pernstein and Johanna of Liblitz (). Little is known about his childhood. In 1497, at the age of seven, he and his elder brother John III were knighted at Pardubice Castle by Ling Vladislav II of Bohemia and Hungary, who was on his way from Prague to Hungary. In 1507, he married Margaret of Kostka of Postupic. His brother John III married Margaret's sister Anna later that year. Vojtěch and Margaret initially resided at Lanškroun Castle. His father held the office of High Hofmeister of Bohemia until 1514, when it was transferred to Vojtěch, with permission of the King. However, the Estates objected, pointing out that Vojtěch was only 24 years old and did not have any relevant experience. William, Vojtěch's father argued that he had received the office for life in 1490, so that the transfer only meant that Vojtěch would inherit the office when William died. William felt that Lanškroun Castle was unsuitable for Hluboká, now that he held high office and therefore gave him Hluboká Castle, which he had purchased in 1490 from the Bohemian Chamber. Consequently, Vojtěch styled himself after 1515, or in German Adalbert von Perstein and Frauenberg. When his father died in 1521, Vojtěch inherited his Bohemian possessions, while his brother John III inherited the Moravian possessions. Vojtěch moved to Pardubice Castle, which he rebuilt in Renaissance style, and began styling himself \\"Vojtěch of Pernštejn and Pardubice\\" (). In the same year, he inherited Chlumec nad Cidlinou from William Kostka of Postupic, the father of his first wife, even though he had since remarried. He also rebuilt the castle in Chlumec nad Cidlinou in Renaissance style. Shortly after his father's death, Vojtěch and his brother John sided with the Utraquists. This may have been the reason why he lost the post of High Hofmeister, which King Louis II of Bohemia and Hungary temporarily gave to Charles I, Duke of Münsterberg-Oels. Nevertheless, the King confirmed Vojtěch later that year as pledge holder of several possessions in eastern Bohemia, including Kunětice Mountain Castle, and assured him he would only lose those possessions if the original owners redeemed their loans. In this case, the original owner had been Opatovice Monastery, which had been destroyed during the Hussite wars, this confirmation virtually assured that Vojtěch would be allowed to keep these possessions. Although Vojtěch had lost he post of High Hofmeister, he still exerted considerable influence until King Louis II died in 1526. Vojtěch was considered a candidate to succeed him, along with Charles I of Münsterberg-Oels, Frederick II of Legnica and Zdeňek Lev of Rožmitál. Among the foreign candidates, Vojtěch supported the Wittelsbach candidate, Louis X. When the Habsburg candidate, Ferdinand I was elected, Vojtěch changed sides and supported him. Ferdinand then appointed Vojtěch Landeshauptmann of Bohemia.Governor from 1526 In 1527, Vojtěch acquired more possessions in eastern Bohemia, including Náchod and Nové Město nad Metují, where a beautiful Renaissance castle built by Vojtěch still stands. In 1531, he acquired the pledge over Kolín, also in eastern Bohemia. Vojtěch was a notable art lover. He built castles in Renaissance style and furnished them and decorated them with precious wall paintings. He died in 1534 in Prague and was buried in a marble Sarcophagus in the St. Bartholomew's Church in Pardubice. Since he had no male heir, his brother John III inherited his entire estate, except for a small share for Vojtěch's daughters. Vojtěch's widow, Johanna of Wartenberg, received Nové Město nad Metují as her widow seat, however, she died two years later.  Marriages and issue  Vojtěch married Margaret Kostka of Postupic in 1507; she died in 1515. They had one son: * Louis (after 1508 - 1526) Vojtěch then remarried to Johanna of Wartenberg (; d. 1536).

He currently serves in the Wisconsin State Assembly. Riemer defeated incumbent Assembly member Peggy Krusick in the August 14, 2012 Democratic primary for the 7th Assembly district. Riemer was the presumptive winner in the November general election, as there were no other candidates in the race; but Krusick filed as an official write-in candidate against Riemer. In the end, Riemer won easily.  Background  Krusick had been in the Assembly since before Riemer was born. Riemer, son of Democratic policy adviser David Riemer (budget director for former governor Jim Doyle), returned to University of Wisconsin Law School on a part-time basis in Fall 2012. He graduated in December 2013 and was admitted to the Wisconsin Bar in April 2014. The district, which includes parts of Milwaukee's south side, West Allis, West Milwaukee and Greenfield, had been drastically redrawn in the 2011 redistricting. He attended Rufus King High School.  Write-in campaign by Krusick  In September 2012 it was reported that Krusick was considering running a write-in campaign against Riemer in the November general election, and it was confirmed that she had contacted staff of the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board about the mechanics of such an effort, but had not yet filed registration documents for such a run. On October 2, it was officially confirmed that she was running as a registered write-in candidate (under Wisconsin law, write-in candidates must register with the state to have their votes be individually counted, rather than lumped in with other write-in votes). She set up a new website and began a direct mail campaign boasting about her \\"independent track record.\\" She did not return press calls, and it was unclear who was funding her campaign against her party's nominee. Riemer won easily in the end, with 16,664 votes (85.4%) to Krusick's 2499 (12.8%) and 361 scattered votes (1.8%).  Personal life  Riemer is married to Paula Phillips, a member of the Milwaukee Board of School Directors. Phillips won the seat while she and Riemer were engaged, in April 2017.

Biography Nikolai Berg was born in Moscow. His father came from an old noble Livonian family. Nikolai studied first at the Tomsk regional college, then (in 1834-1838) at the Tambov and Moscow gymnasiums. In 1844 he enrolled into the Philological faculty of Moscow University but left an after a year. In the early 1850s he joined the 'young faction' of Moskvityanin and, along with Boris Almazov, Evgeny Edelson, Lev Mei, Terty Filippov, and Apollon Grigoriev, became a member of what came to be known as the Ostrovsky circle. In 1853 he went to Sevastopol as a correspondent, and stayed there until the end of the siege, working as a translator at the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief. He later published Notes on the Siege of Sevastopol (Moscow, 1858) and the Sevastopol Album, a collection of 37 drawings. After the Crimean War ended, Berg went to the Caucasus where he witnessed the capture and arrest of Imam Shamil. He then travelled to Italy as a correspondent of The Russian Messenger to report on the progress of Giuseppe Garibaldi's army. Berg spent 1860-1862 travelling through Syria, Palestine and Egypt. As the January Uprising in Poland began he went to Warsaw as a correspondent for the Saint Petersburg magazine Vedomosti and stayed there for the rest of his life, teaching Russian language and literature at Warsaw University beginning in 1868, then editing the newspaper The Warsaw Diary (Varshavsky Dnevnik) from 1874 to 1877.

The shareholders appoint a Supervisory Board, composed of actors of the European energy sector, which elects the Management Board and approves the strategy of the company. The Supervisory Board supports EPEX SPOT's work on the integration of the European power market and takes into account the increasing number of collaborations of European and international scale., Supervisory Board An Exchange Council composed of market participants has been put in place as an independent body in order to ensure state of the art governance rules. 22 members and 4 permanent guests meeting up quarterly represent adequately the diversity of economic and corporate profiles that exists among the Exchange Members from various sectors., Exchange Council EPEX SPOT holds 100% subsidiaries in Switzerland, EPEX SPOT Schweiz AG, and in Belgium, EPEX SPOT Belgium SA.  Trading  In 2016 the volume of traded electricity on the markets of EPEX SPOT amounted to 529 terawatt hours (TWh)., Press release 11.01.2017 = Day- ahead markets = EPEX SPOT operates day-ahead power markets for Germany/Austria/Luxembourg, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. These day-ahead markets are organized by an auction process, matching once a day supply and demand curves and thus fixing prices in an anonymous, yet transparent and secured manner. Members of the Exchange enter their orders for hourly quantities of power into the order book which is closed on 11 am for Switzerland and on 12 pm for all other markets. EPEX SPOT calculates the offer and demand curves and their intersection for each hour of the following day. Results are published from 11.10 am (Switzerland) and 12.55 pm (all other markets). The price index for the German/Austrian/Luxembourg market is called the Physical Electricity Index, or PHELIX, and is a reference for power wholesale prices in Europe by virtue of its underlying liquidity. = Market Coupling = The Belgian, Dutch, German/Austrian/Luxembourg, French and British day-ahead auctions are part of the Multi-Regional Coupling. It links the markets of Austria, Benelux, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, the Nordic and the Baltic countries by a price coupling solution in order to optimize the use of cross-border capacities between these countries, increasing the gains in social welfare on all markets. = Intraday markets = EPEX SPOT also operates intraday power markets for Germany/Luxembourg, France, The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland. The intraday markets are organized by continuous trading – orders of the members are entered perpetually into the order book. As soon as two orders are compatible, the trade is executed. Contracts for hourly quantities of power can be traded up to 30 minutes before physical fulfillment, and even up to five minutes within the respective German control zones, within Belgium and within the Netherlands. In Switzerland and across borders, trade is possible until 60 minutes before delivery. Since 14 December 2010, members can conclude cross-border trades between the intraday markets of Germany/Luxembourg and France. The intraday trading system used by EPEX SPOT, M7 (ComXerv), allows simultaneous cross-border trades on the Exchange and via OTC. With the launch of the Austrian intraday market in October 2012, cross-border transactions were expanded to Austria. Switzerland followed in June 2013. The intraday trading systems of Belgium and the Netherlands were connected in 2016. Flexibility contracts In December 2011, EPEX SPOT introduced 15-minute contracts on the continuous intraday market in Germany. These contracts facilitate trading with intermittent power sources and help dealing with intra-hour variations in production and consumption. With the launch of the intraday market in Switzerland, 15-minute contracts were extended to this market, including cross-border trading. In December 2014, EPEX SPOT launched a call auction for 15-minute contracts on the German intraday market in order to provide a reliable price signal on a quarter-hour basis. This auction at 3 pm provides at tool for balance responsible parties to fine-tune their portfolios on a 15-minute basis during production ramps and forecast deviations. In so doing, the price signal of 15-minute contracts contributes to the added value of flexibility and provides at the same time incentives for system stabilization., Call auction for 15-minute contracts, Bundesnetzagentur/Bundeskartellamt (2014): Monitoringbericht 2014. Page 19. In 2017, EPEX SPOT introduced 30-minute contracts on the French, German and Swiss continuous intraday market, enabling local and implicit cross-border trades on the respective borders. These contracts are designed to manage emerging flexibility challenges of power markets more efficiently and help market participants to fulfil their balance requirements towards the French transmission system operator.  Integration with APX Group  In April 2015, EPEX SPOT and former APX Group announced the integration of their businesses in order to form a Power Exchange for Central Western Europe (CWE, encompassing Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland) and the UK. The integration of EPEX SPOT and APX Group reduced barriers in power trading in the CWE and UK region. Market participants benefit from harmonized trading systems, one single rulebook and one admission process for the entire region, therefore reducing trading costs and lowering entry barriers for new participants. Moreover, they have access to a wider range of products and benefit from best-of-both standards and reliable customer support. Overall, the integration led to a more effective governance and further facilitated the creation of a single European power market fully in line with the objectives of the European electricity regulatory framework., Press release 17.04.2015 Since 31 December 2016, all former APX Group entities act under the EPEX SPOT name.

He was an ancestor of many kings of Maui and is believed that he never had any control over any significant portion of Maui. He was a descendant of Hemā of the Ulu line. It is mentioned by Abraham Fornander“And from Pili the ruling Hawaiian chiefs, down to the Kamehameha family, claimed their descent; and, as if conscious of their usurpation or intrusion up the domestic line, their genealogists and bards in subsequent ages were always trying to connect Pili with the indigenous chiefs on the Maui line from Paumakua and Haho.” that Paumakua probably did not arrive on Maui earlier than the time of his father.Abraham Fornander, An Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origin and Migrations, Rutland, VT: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1969 He is also mentioned by physician Nathaniel B. Emerson.Paumakua of Maui  Family  Father of Paumakua was Chief Huanuiekalaiaʻilaʻikai (otherwise known as Huanuiʻikalaʻilaʻi), who was born on Oahu as a son of Chief Paunuikaikeanaina and his wife Kapohaʻakia. Mother of Paumakua was called Kapoea or Kapola, and she was born c. 1010. Of Paumakua himself little is to tell. Of his brother Kuheailani, nothing remarkable has been retain upon Hawaiian traditions. Kuheailaniʻs son Hakalanilea appear to have become the lord of some lands in the Hilo district of Hawaiʻi.

MicroRNAs are usually derived from precursors known as pre-miRNAs, these pre-miRNAs are recognised and cleaved from a pri-miRNA precursor by the Pasha and Drosha proteins. However some microRNAs, mirtrons, are known to be derived from introns via a different pathway which bypasses Pasha and Drosha. Some microRNAs are also known to be derived from small nucleolar RNA. Discovery Small nucleolar RNA derived microRNA was first described in 2008. The protozoal intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia lacks the Drosha protein involved in pre-miRNA cleavage from pri-miRNA. However the miRNA processing protein dicer is found in Giardia. A 26 nucleotide RNA, miR2, is processed from the Giardia lamblia snoRNA GlsR17 by dicer. MiR2 is a microRNA which may regulate the expression of variant surface proteins. Also in 2008, a small RNA was found to be cleaved from SCARNA15, a Human small Cajal body-specific RNA, by Dicer. This small RNA was found to function as a microRNA. Potential microRNAs were also identified in several other Human snoRNAs. Giardia snoRNA-derived miRNAs Giardia lamblia produces at least 20 snoRNAs. SnoRNAs guide the modification of rRNA, and contain a region of 10–21 nucleotides which is complementary to the target RNA. Five of the Giardia lamblia snoRNAs have no complementarities to rRNA, implying that they may have a different function.

The film is produced by Yleisradio in cooperation with Savane Productions and Filmistuudio Kalevipojad. It is directed by a Kenyan Gilbert Lukalia. The film's world premiere was on The Helsinki International Love & Anarchy Film Festival on September 28, 2012.  Plot  The story of the film focuses on Mannerheim's private life from 1905-1918\\\\. It tells about a failed marriage with Anastasia Arapova, and love affair with Kitty Linder after the Finnish Civil War. According to Gilbert Lukalian, \\"It's an universal story about a man who has difficulty reconciling family life and career.\\"  Cast  * Telley Savalas Otieno as Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim * Beatrice Wangui as Anastasia Arapova  Production  In winter 2012 Yle reported on a forthcoming Mannerheim film, which would be an international production. Information of the film being filmed in a foreign country became to public, before Yle had time to organize a press conference on August 16, 2012. Erkko Lyytinen got the idea for the film in Kenya from an Estonian producer Ken Saan. Saan had asked from Lyytinen if he had any project that could be filmed at Kenya. According to Lyytinen, Saan's aspect at the production was a major success of the movie filming. The screenplay was written by a Kenyan work group. Yle gave to scriptwriters the necessary facts, but the group created the portrait of Mannerheim themselves. Originally the film was going to be a war film, but turned out to be a biographical film, because it was too hard to shoot the war scenes at the bad circumstances. The film was shot around Nairobi in May and June. Gilbert Lukalia was chosen to be a director of the film in just 12 hours before the start of filming. They also made a six-part documentary of making the film called Operation Mannerheim, which cost about 100,000–150,000 €, even though the movie itself cost only 20,000 €.  Reception  = Stir before the premiere = The film sparked a debate even before it was published. The Finnish media raised a stir about a black actor performing Mannerheim. Producer Markus Selin said that the film is a \\"spoofing\\", and director Matti Kassila wondered why Yle had given a license for the description. Jörn Donner believes that the film is \\"a bluff\\", and said that Yle is trying to cash in on the Marshal's reputation.

The first cast in the series, Kamehameha I statue (original cast), is located in North Kohala on the island of Hawaii. The second cast stands outside the Aliiōlani Hale government building in Honolulu, located on the island of Oahu. Made of cast brass, it depicts Kamehameha I and has become a recognizable cultural symbol for the Hawaiian Islands. Description The statue is an oversized brass cast of King Kamehameha I, the ruler credited with unifying the Hawaiian Islands in the early nineteenth century and establishing the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1810. The surface is two-toned, finished with a dark brown chemical patina with gilded (See gilding) garments. Erected in 1883, it was commissioned as a replacement for Kamehameha the Great (original cast), which had been commissioned to celebrate the centennial of Captain James Cook’s arrival to the Hawaiian Islands. It was placed in front of the Aliiōlani Hale government building in Honolulu, the spot intended for the original cast, and remains there to this day. Historical information =Commission and delivery to Hawaii= The history of the Kamehameha I statue (second cast) is closely tied to the history of the first cast. The idea behind both works originated in 1878, when Walter M. Gibson, a member of the Hawaiian legislature, decided to commission a sculpture to commemorate the centennial of the arrival of Captain James Cook to the Hawaiian Islands. Government money was allocated to fund the project, and Gibson was put in charge of the committee overseeing its production.Wharton, Glenn. 2012. The Painted King: Art, Activism, and Authenticity in Hawaii. University of Hawai Press: 20. Gibson selected American artist Thomas Ridgeway Gould to create the statue, who finished the full-size plaster model for the work in 1880.Wharton, 20. The model was sent to the Barbedienne Foundry in Paris, France to be cast in brass, and the finished product was shipped to Hawaii in August; however, the ship delivering the statue encountered a storm and sank near the Falkland Islands. To replace it, the second cast was commissioned by Hawaii officials using the approximately $12,000 insurance settlement collected from the loss of the original. The replacement statue arrived in Honolulu in January, 1883, but the original cast had already been recovered from the sea and finally completed its journey to Hawaii in March, 1882. Because the second cast was in better condition, it was decided that it, not the original, would be placed outside the Aliiolani Hale government building in Honolulu. Having arrived too late to be used in the celebration of Cook’s arrival to the Islands, its unveiling was instead incorporated into the coronation ceremonies of King David Kalākaua in February, 1883.Wharton, 39. =Features= See Features of Kamehameha I statue (original cast). After the shipwreck and loss of the original statue, Gibson and Gould worked together to provide the replacement cast with one additional feature: four partial-gilt bas-relief panels to decorate the sides of the statue’s plinth, paid for with an additional $4,000 from the insurance settlement. Each panel depicted a scene from Kamehameha’s life, though Gibson wanted the panels to serve as a kind of propaganda, much like Trajan’s Column and other representations of heroic battles in classical monuments. As such, the historical accuracy of the events depicted in the reliefs is questionable; debate exists as to whether or not Kamehameha was even present at some of the events.Wharton, 33-35. Gould returned to his studio in Florence to begin work on the reliefs, but died of a heart attack on November 26, 1881, after only managing to complete the maquette for the first relief. His son, Marshall S. Gould, completed the remaining three maquettes.Wharton, 33-34. The scenes depicted on the panels include: * Kamehameha’s first encounter with Captain James Cook, on board the Resolution (See HMS Resolution (1771)) off the coast of Lahaina in 1778. * Kamehameha as a warrior, fending off a barrage of spears. * Kamehameha as he reviews a war fleet off the coast of Kohala, Hawaii. * A group of travelers resting alongside a road, meant to illustrate Kamehameha’s Kānāwai Māmalahoe, his guarantee of free and safe access to roadways. Artist See Thomas Ridgeway Gould. Cultural significance The Kamehameha I statue (second cast) has become an important political symbol for the Hawaiian Islands. It is featured on the official Hawaiian state seal (See Seal of Hawaii), and in the logo of the Kamehameha Schools, which has campuses located throughout the Islands. In 1959, a third Kamehameha I statue was cast using models from second cast, and placed in Sanctuary Hall inside the U.S. Capitol Building (See United States Capitol) in Washington, D.C. to honor Hawaii becoming the fiftieth state. Various businesses, especially those working in the tourist trade, have capitalized on the resulting popularity of the sculpture; its image has been used to decorate brochures, postcards, T-shirts, folk-art, etc., and small reproductions of the sculpture are popular souvenirs in many shops.Wharton, 92. The statue also features a prominent role in Kamehameha Day celebrations, the annual Hawaiian holiday celebrating the Kingdom of Hawaii’s first monarch. During the festivities, the statue is ceremoniously draped in long lei, meant to honor Kamehameha I and his accomplishments. Additional casts and reproductions Several additional casts and reproductions of Kamehameha I exist throughout Hawaii and the continental United States, including: # Kamehameha I (original cast), located in Kapaau, North Kohala, on the Island of Hawaii. # Kamehameha I (third cast), located in National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. # Kamehameha I (Hilo reproduction), located in Hilo, Hawaii.

W.)H.W. is used here as most external references to Hiram use those initials instead of the full name. was educated at Brattleboro, Vermont. H.W. attended Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1836 and graduated in 1840. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He taught school in Tuskegee, Alabama, from June 1840 to December 1841. He was appointed Principal of the New London Female Academy in New London, Connecticut, a position he held until March 1855. On March 17, 1842 H.W. married Deborah (Della) Torrey Lerow in Boston. She was born on July 5, 1815 in Orange, Massachusetts. She was a teacher of French and Botany at the New London academy. They had three children one of whom died thirteen months after his birth. Della died on June 5, 1850. He also served as the railroad agent at New London for one year for the Northern Railroad. On December 3, 1855 H.W. married his second wife, Harriet Ann Stoddard (born May 28, 1822). In the 1850s H.W. participated in the public discussions of the era concerning slavery. H.W. was a Congregationalist and abolitionist. As the political turmoil increased he decided on a course of action inspired by the New England Emigrant Aid Company of Boston. This company was formed to facilitate overland treks to Kansas of Free-Stater families to help throw pre- statehood Kansas into the abolitionists camp. The New England Emigrant Aid Company was formed to help fund resettlement of abolitionist sympathizers in Kansas prior to referendums to determine if Kansas would be a slave state. Three groups sponsored by the Society set out for Kansas – the first in March 1855. H.W. didn't leave New England until March 4, 1856 with his new wife who was pregnant and with his two small daughters from his first marriage. It took six weeks to trek by wagon to Kansas.  Kansas Pioneer  On May 9, 1856, H.W. and his family arrived in Lawrence in the Kansas Territory which was quickly seen to be unsuitable even though Lawrence had been founded by the New England Emigrant Aid Company. The family moved on to Topeka, Kansas arriving May 16, 1856. Topeka was laid out in 1854 as a Free-State town. Pioneer H.W.'s first act in Topeka was the purchase of a farm and then the start-up of the Topeka Mill Co., a saw, grist and flouring mill, in association with A. Merrill and S. T. Walkley. On July 14, 1856, H.W. helped found and became one of the first deacons of \\"The First Free Congregational Church of Topeka\\". H.W. was then elected on December 6, 1859 to the first Territorial Senate of Kansas prior to statehood. He was a Republican representative of Shawnee County. The following year he was elected as the fourth mayor of Topeka. After much turmoil, Kansas was admitted to the union as a free state on January 29, 1861. H.W. resigned from the Kansas Senate May 1, 1861, in order to accept an Indian Agency appointment in Morris County at Council Grove, Kansas and in June 1861 President Abraham Lincoln appointed him as agent to the Kaw Indians.Four Kaw Indian families took the name of Farnsworth in the 1860s when they were obliged to adopt surnames for the census. Joseph James (Joe Jim), a mixed- blood Kaw Indian, was an interpreter for H.W. H.W. became an Indian Commissioner June 24, 1864 by order of Abraham Lincoln who appointed \\"Hiram W. Farnsworth, Indian Agent a commissioner on the part of the United States and the chiefs and headmen of the Kansas Tribe of Indians.\\" H.W. was still living with his family at the Council Grove Indian Agency June 3, 1868. On that date a skirmish of the Cheyenne with the Kaw Indians occurred. This battle was full of sound and fury but had no casualties and this was the last Indian battle in the state of Kansas. It was conducted at the Council Grove Indian Agency and other locations with some arrows even landing in the grounds of the agency — the Farnsworth family members were spectators.It is probably in this time period that his courtesy title as Major was established, since he never held military rank. During his tenure there, H.W. was appointed on March 13, 1862 for six months to be Commissioner on the part of the United States to negotiate treaties with the Kansas Indian tribes. Treaties concluded at the Kansas Agency with about one hundred tribes were signed by H.W. with his signature and seal. Due to his prominence in the Topeka area, H.W. became one of the first directors for the Atchison & Topeka Railroad on March 3, 1863.In 1920, the town of Farnsworth, Texas, was named for H.W. as an early director of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Similarly, due to his background in education, H.W. was a founder of Washburn College, incorporated February 6, 1865 from Lincoln College. H.W. served on the board of trustees of that college for twenty years. In October 1866 he was replaced as Indian Agent by President Andrew Johnson and then in December appointed by the president to be one of three commissioners to visit and inspect Indian schools. In 1867 he accompanied the Indian tribal leaders to Washington, D.C. to sign treaties along with his Kaw Indian interpreter, Joe Jim. It was customary at the time that Indian chiefs visiting Washington be photographed in full tribal regalia with their Indian Agent. H.W. declined that honor because he felt the Indians were being cheated of their lands and hence he did not wish to be associated with such an endeavor. This trip to Washington, D.C. was the occasion for the photograph made of his Kaw Indian interpreter Joe Jim. H.W.'s interpreter, Joe Jim, is credited for giving the name of Topeka to that town.Connelley, William E. \\"Origin of the Name of Topeka.\\" Collections of the Kansas State Historical Society, Vol. 27, pp.589-593  Later Years in Topeka  In May 1867 H.W. moved his family back to Topeka to live in the home he had built at 401 Topeka Ave. By now his family included seven children. On May 21, 1867 citizens of Topeka voted to form the Topeka Board of Education and elected H.W. to that first board. On September 25, 1867 H.W. signed a petition to the state of Kansas which supported voting rights for women and blacks. He was one of forty-five Kansas signers. In March 1869 H.W. was appointed postmaster of Topeka which position he held until 1873. In 1870 H.W. joined the Pilgrim Society. 1870 was the 250th anniversary year of the Pilgrim's landing at Plymouth, Mass.H.W. was a descendant of Matthias Farnsworth who arrived in the Plymouth area in 1635. H.W. was appointed police judge of Topeka in 1874. In 1876 he was elected Secretary (clerk) of the Board of Education of Topeka which office he held until his death. In 1876 he was elected secretary of the Topeka Masonic Lodge, a position he filled for the rest of his life. The Free Public Library of Topeka was founded November 12, 1878 with H.W. as one of the founders. H.W. was a member of the Association of Old Settlers of Topeka because of his early arrival in 1856. On January 6, 1894, Harriet died. On July 26, 1899 H.W. died at his home in Topeka and was buried in the Topeka Cemetery sharing a tombstone with his wife Harriet.

A campus of Purdue University, Purdue Fort Wayne was founded on July 1, 2018, when its predecessor university, Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne formally split into two separate institutions: Purdue University Fort Wayne and Indiana University Fort Wayne. About two weeks before the split took effect, the athletic program, inherited solely by Purdue Fort Wayne, changed its branding from Fort Wayne Mastodons to Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons. The university's 14 men's and women's athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA Horizon League.

Twenty-four years earlier, Indiana University also began offering courses in Fort Wayne.The Creation Years: Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne, John Ankenbruck, Evangel Press, 1983. From 1958–1964, both universities began the process of combining the two extension centers into one joint university, known as Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW). IPFW opened on September 17, 1964, following nearly two years of construction on a site northeast of downtown Fort Wayne. It awarded its first four-year degree in 1968. Eight years later, in 1976, IPFW absorbed the Fort Wayne Art Institute, an art school that had served the Fort Wayne community since 1897. In 1998, this academic unit was renamed the School of Fine and Performing Arts, later becoming the College of Visual and Performing Arts. After several years of talks between IPFW, Purdue, and IU, IPFW was divided into two universities on July 1, 2018: Purdue University Fort Wayne, and Indiana University Fort Wayne.

Jeliński is a recognized authority in bee diseases and an active member of the Kashubian community. He is involved in a range of activities focusing on the preservation of the Kashubian language and culture. Jeliński is also known for his support of Kashubian embroidery and building bridges between Kashubian communities in Poland and Canada. He and his wife, Alicja, have two sons and currently live in Żukowo, near Gdańsk, Poland. Education In 1968, Jeliński enrolled at the Agricultural and Technical University of Olsztyn, to study veterinary medicine, broadening his prospective at the Tierärztliche Hochschule in Hannover, Germany. In 1974, he completed his graduate studies and became a veterinarian, accepting employment from the National Veterinary Research Institute at the Department of Diseases of Useful Insects in Swarzędz, near Poznań. In 1978, Jeliński received a scholarship to study at the Free University of (West) Berlin. During the three months he spent there, he demonstrated how a strain of Bacillus possesses mycolytic properties against Ascosphaera mycelia. In 1980, Jeliński submitted his Ph.D. in veterinary sciences at the National Veterinary Research Institute of Puławy, Poland. His dissertation contributed to a greater understanding of the biochemical activities of Paenibacillus larvae subsp. larvae (formerly classified as Bacillus larvae) - i.e., American foulbrood is caused by this bacterium. Professional life A 1976 visit to Bulgaria had a profound impact on his career. Here, for the first time Jeliński witnessed the deadly parasitic mite, Varroa destructor. While at the Bulgarian Department of Microbiology, Jeliński (along with Dr. M. Shabanov) published an article in the Polish magazine Pszczelarstwo (The Beekeeping) about this deadly parasite that affects honey bees. Later, he published the V. destructor (formerly classified as Varroa jacobsoni) article in Austria and France. When, in 1980, the mite Varroa destructor was detected in Poland, and later causing death of many bee colonies and no satisfactory treatment had yet been found, Jeliński vastly contributed to the testing of Apiwarol AS – amitraz and Warrosekt – malation as an effective alternativetreatment. Applied as smoke, these agents helped to control Varroa infestation. As a subject matter expert, Jeliński’s research on bee diseases results were in broad use in Poland for the next couple of decades. In 1988, Jeliński found for the first time Varroa destructor on Vespula vulgaris. Jeliński was actively involved in providing training to Ghanaian and Iraqi beekeepers. Jeliński is a member of the New York Academy of Sciences, the Scientific Association of Gdańsk (Poland) and the Foundation of Beekeeping Open-Air Museum in Żukowo (Poland). Jeliński has written or co-written more than 200 articles, published in Polish, English, German and Bulgarian. He is a recognized name in the beekeeping community, thanks to his publications in such professional journals as Pszczelarstwo (Beekeeping), Pszczelarz Polski (The Polish Beekeeper), Medycyna Weterynaryjna (Veterinary Medicine) and Apidologie (Apidology). =Conferences= Jeliński regularly participates in professional workshops and conferences. *1987 - Warsaw, Poland.

The City of Boca Raton, incorporated in 1925, is one of the largest and the southernmost city in Palm Beach County, Florida.  History  The Woman's Club of Boca Raton started the community library in January, 1923. The library was managed by a group of volunteers and the collection was developed from donations. It closed in 1926 and the collection was donated to a local elementary school. In January, 1946, the community library reopened and its collection was housed in a building located on the Boca Raton Army Air Field. Severe damage from a hurricane forced the library to close again in 1947. Another community library opened inside the city's town hall in 1948. With the help of funding from the city, the library moved to the administration building of the Garden Apartments on West Palmetto Road in 1957. A new library building was completed in 1961 on NW 2nd Avenue, the location of the current Downtown Library. In 1966 this building was dedicated to the city and named the Boca Raton Public Library. The building subsequently underwent several renovations. In 2003 Boca Raton voters approved a $19.8 million bond issue for the building of two new library buildings. The first building, located at 1501 Spanish River Boulevard, opened on January 26, 2008 and is known as the Spanish River Library and Community Center. The second building was constructed on Boca Raton Boulevard, a block north of the original Boca Raton Downtown Library, and opened in June 2013.  Facilities  The Boca Raton Library has two locations to serve the residents of incorporated Boca Raton. The New Boca Raton Downtown Library (41,932 square feet) is at 400 N.W. Boca Raton Boulevard. The Spanish River Library and Community Center (40,940 square feet) is located at 1501 N.W. Spanish River Boulevard. The Spanish River Library, built in the Addison Mizner (1872-1933) style, additionally provides public space for meetings, gatherings, and events. The hours of the library are posted on the library web site. The Old Downtown Library (21,400 square feet) was located at 200 N.W. Boca Raton Boulevard. Groundbreaking for the new 41,932 square foot Boca Raton Downtown Library took place on April 24, 2012. The new library was designed by PGAL of Boca Raton in the Mediterranean architectural style of Addison Mizner (1872-1933). The library is built to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification requirements. The new Boca Raton Downtown Library was officially opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony and celebration on June 22, 2013. The 42,000 square foot building features 70 public access computers, study rooms, and events space. The Boca Raton Public Library opened the Discover Studio within the Downtown location in September 2015. The Studio was funded by the Friends of the Boca Raton Public Library. The Discover Studio utilizes a pop-up space model to teach emerging technologies, including 3D printing, photo and film editing, music production and audio podcasting. Classes are taught by qualified librarian instructors and outside expert instructors. The Discover Studio is a part of the library's involvement in community education. All classes are free with a valid library card.

The political positions of Paul Ryan, the U.S. Representative from Wisconsin's 1st congressional district from 1999 to 2019 and the 54th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 2015 to 2019, were generally conservative, with a focus on fiscal policy. Ryan was Chairman of the House Budget Committee from 2011 to 2015 and of Ways and Means in 2015. Ryan was the Republican nominee for Vice President as the running mate of Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. Ryan supports eliminating the capital gains tax, the corporate income tax, the estate tax, and the Alternative Minimum Tax. In 1999, Ryan supported the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During the economic recovery from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other financial institutions, and the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation. Ryan believes federal poverty reduction programs are ineffective and supports cuts to welfare, child care, Pell Grants, food stamps, and other federal assistance programs. Ryan supports block granting Medicaid to the states and the privatization of social security and Medicare. Ryan supported the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit and opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \\"Obamacare.\\" Ryan supported the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), the House Republican plan to repeal and replace the ACA, which passed the House on May 4, 2017. Ryan is pro-life and opposes abortion rights. Ryan opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which bolstered women's rights to equal pay for equal work. Ryan supports civil unions and opposes same-sex marriage. Ryan supports school vouchers, and supported the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 and its repeal in 2015. Ryan is unsure, and believes climate scientists are unsure, of the impact of human activity on climate change. Ryan supports tax incentives for the petroleum industry and opposes them for renewable energy. Ryan supports gun rights and opposes stricter gun control. Ryan supported the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Conservatism and partisanship Ryan speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, D.C. in March 2014 Ryan is \\"proudly, conservatively ideological\\" and \\"religiously conservative,\\" according to The New York Times in 2012. In 2009, he was rated the 39th most conservative member of the House. The 2011 National Journal Vote Ratings rated him 68.2 on the conservative scale, being more conservative than 68% of the full House, and he ranked as the 150th most conservative member based on roll-call votes. Ryan has a lifetime American Conservative Union rating of 91/100. In the 111th Congress, Ryan has sided with a majority of Republicans in 93% of House votes in which he has participated, and has sided with the overall majority vote of all House votes 95% of the time. Ryan chaired the 2016 Republican National Convention. Asked on June 19, 2016, on Meet the Press about his support for Donald Trump, Ryan said \\"The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House.\\" He denied the characterization of his position by interviewer Chuck Todd as \\"party over country.\\" Fiscal policy In 1995, as the top legislative aide for freshman representative Sam Brownback of Kansas, Ryan helped lead the policy team for a group of conservative freshman representatives who called themselves the New Federalists. The New Federalists advocated shrinking the federal government by eliminating federal government departments, spending cuts, and restructuring entitlement spending. Ryan has an interest in political economics and has been a thought leader in Congress on issues of budget reform. He helped bring the issues of the national debt and the national deficit into the national policy debate. Ryan subscribes to supply-side economics. His positions on fiscal policy have included tax cuts, cuts to entitlement programs, freezes on discretionary spending, the elimination of automatic inflation increases in calculating budget baselines, deregulation, and the privatization of social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and education. =Budget proposals and budgetary process reform proposals= In his sixth term in 2008, Ryan began introducing budget proposals as a member of the House, distinct from his contributions to budget proposals in his capacity as a member and later ranking member and chair of the House Budget Committee. His budget proposals were embraced by many of the Tea Party movement freshman Representatives elected to Congress in the 2010 midterm elections. Ryan supports a line-item veto. Roadmaps In early 2007, Ryan briefed members of the House Ways and Means Committee on his plans to draft a \\"Roadmap for America's Future.\\" On May 21, 2008, Ryan introduced H.R. 6110, the Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2008, commonly referred to as the \\"Ryan budget\\". This proposed legislation outlined changes to entitlement spending, including a controversial proposal to replace Medicare with a voucher program for those under the age of 55. The Roadmap found only eight sponsors and did not move past committee. On April 1, 2009, he introduced his alternative to the 2010 United States federal budget. It would have eliminated the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and imposed a five-year spending freeze on all discretionary spending. It would have also phased out Medicare's traditional fee-for-service model; instead it would have offered fixed sums in the form of vouchers for those under the age of 55, with which Medicare beneficiaries could buy private insurance. Ryan's proposed budget would also have allowed taxpayers to opt out of the federal income taxation system with itemized deductions, and instead pay a marginal tax rate 10 percent of adjusted gross income up to $100,000 for couples ($50,000 for singles) and 25 percent on any remaining income. It was ultimately rejected in the Democratic controlled House by a vote of 293–137, with 38 Republicans opposed. Obama during a bipartisan meeting on health insurance reform, February 25, 2010 On January 27, 2010, the day of President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Ryan reintroduced a modified version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010. The modified plan would have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid. Obama initially viewed Ryan as a Republican who could help cut the federal deficit. In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a \\"serious proposal\\" finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying \\"some ideas in there ... that I would agree with, but there are some ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them\\". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's \\"Roadmap\\" with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had \\"some potential\\" to make healthcare prices \\"more sustainable,\\" he was more \\"confident\\" in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a \\"fraud\\" saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and \\"dismantling Medicare as we know it\\" by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that \\"Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate.\\" The 2010 version of the Roadmap found only 14 cosponsors. On August 31, 2010, the National Republican Congressional Committee requested members not to defend the Roadmap, noting its proposal to privatize social security. Paths to prosperity In the 2010 midterm elections, Ryan advised and endorsed Republican candidates in the primaries and general elections, and his budget proposals were embraced by many of the Tea Party movement-inspired freshman Representatives. On April 11, 2011, Ryan introduced H.Con.Res. 34, a federal budget for fiscal year 2012, known as \\"The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise.\\" The plan included repealing the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \\"Obamacare\\", the privatization of Medicare by issuing vouchers for private insurance, and block granting Medicaid funding to the states. Income tax rates would be lowered. Increases in defense spending, and decreases in federal funding for Medicaid and for health insurance for children, were proposed. On April 5, 2011, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted that The Path to Prosperity was \\"a path to poverty for America's seniors and children\\". On April 13, 2011, speaking of Ryan's budget proposal, Obama said: \\"I don't think there's anything courageous about asking for sacrifice from those who can least afford it. There's nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.\\" The House passed the Ryan plan on April 15, 2011, by a vote of 235–193. Four Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting against it. On an April 27, 2011, conference call with reporters Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that passage of the Ryan plan \\"would be one of the worst things to happen to this country\\". On May 25, 2011, the Ryan budget plan was defeated in the Senate. On March 23, 2012, Ryan introduced a version of his federal budget for the fiscal year 2013, known as \\"The Path to Prosperity: A Blueprint for American Renewal.\\" It proposed reducing all discretionary spending in the budget from 12.5% of GDP in 2011 to 3.75% of GDP in 2050. On March 29, 2012, the House of Representatives passed the resolution along partisan lines, 228 yeas to 191 nays; ten Republicans voted against the bill, along with all the House Democrats. The bill was defeated in the Democratic-controlled Senate. An analysis by the CBO showed that the Ryan plan would not balance the budget for at least 28 years, partly because the changes in Medicare would not affect anyone older than 55. Former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker and Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, praised the budget for making tough choices. Walker believed it needed to go even further, tackling Social Security and defense spending. In contrast, David Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, has declared that Ryan's budget \\"is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices\\" and would \\"do nothing to reverse the nation's economic decline and arrest its fiscal collapse\\". Ezra Klein also criticized the budget for making \\"unrealistic assumptions\\". The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities was highly critical of Ryan's budget proposal, stating that it would shift income to the wealthy while increasing poverty and inequality. Parts of the 2012 Ryan budget were criticized by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for its proposed cuts to housing and food stamp programs. Faculty and administrators of Georgetown University challenged what they described as Ryan's misapplication of Catholic social teaching in defending his plan. Most of the proposed policies in Ryan's agenda were unpopular with the majority of Americans, and Democrats took issue with them in the 2012 election. The 113th Congress (2013) and the fiscal year 2014 budget Ryan supported a group of three budget reform bills that were considered by the House during the 113th United States Congress. He supported H.R. 1874, the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013, which would have required the Congressional Budget Office to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect. He also supported H.R. 1872, the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014, which would have modified the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, including requiring the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. He also supported H.R. 1871, the Baseline Reform Act of 2013, which would have discontinued the practice of automatic increases for inflation in projecting discretionary appropriations in CBO's baseline budgeting. Arguing in favor of H.R. 1871, Ryan said that \\"families don't get automatic raises every year. Neither should Washington\\". He said that these three budget reform bills \\"are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington\\". Ryan claimed that \\"by improving the budget process, we can get a better handle on our spending problem\\". The three budget reform bills passed the House and died in the Senate budget committee. Ryan submitted a new budget plan for Fiscal Year 2014 to the House in March 2013. It claimed to balance the budget by 2023 by repealing Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \\"Obamacare\\", and would have instituted federal vouchers into Medicare, and cut Medicare benefits and spending on education, research, food safety and other domestic programs. This budget, House Concurrent Resolution 25, was voted on by the House on March 21, 2013, and passed 221-207. Ryan was chairman of the House Budget committee during the 2013 budget sequestration, debt-ceiling crisis, and federal government shutdown. He suggested using discussions about raising the federal debt ceiling as \\"leverage\\" to reduce federal spending. In January 2013, he said that sequestration would likely occur because the Democrats offered no alternative. Ryan voted against the Senate compromise continuing resolution that ended the shutdown, which included raising the debt ceiling and funding for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. On December 10, 2013, Ryan announced that he and Democratic Senator Patty Murray, his counterpart as chairperson of the Senate Budget Committee, had reached a compromise agreement on a two-year, bipartisan budget bill, called the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. The deal would cap the federal government's spending for Fiscal Year 2014 at $1.012 trillion and for Fiscal Year 2015 at $1.014. The proposed deal would eliminate some spending cuts required by the sequester. $45 billion of the cuts were scheduled to happen in January 2014, and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to occur in 2015. The deal offset the spending increases by raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers. Overall the fee increases and spending reductions totalled about $85 billion over a decade. The budget became law. Ryan said that he was \\"proud\\" of the agreement because \\"it reduces the deficit – without raising taxes\\". Some conservative Republicans objected to his budget proposal. Republican Raul Labrador criticized the \\"terrible plan,\\" saying that \\"it makes promises to the American people that are false. Today the Democrats realized they were right all along, that we would never hold the line on the sequester.\\" Other conservatives were more positive: \\"It achieves most of the things we would like to see when we have divided government,\\" said Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.). In 2014, Ryan released a refresh of his budget plan which would cut spending by 5.1 trillion over a decade and claimed to balance the budget by 2024. his proposed budget for fiscal year 2015 included deep cuts to domestic spending to reduce projected federal deficits by about $5 trillion over the next decade. In releasing the budget, Ryan stated: \\"We have to stop spending money we don't have.\\" According to the White House, Ryan's 2014 budget proposal would increase taxes on middle-class families by an average of $2000, while cutting taxes for the richest Americans. Spending Some commentators have criticized Ryan's votes for what they believe were deficit-increasing policies during the George W. Bush administration as being inconsistent with fiscal conservatism. While he voted for the two Bush tax cuts (in 2001 and 2003), he also voted for the 2003 bill that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and the $700 billion bank bailout, and Ryan was one of 32 Republicans in the House to vote for the auto industry bailout. In 2011 President Barack Obama criticized Ryan as \\"not [being] on the level\\" by describing himself as a fiscal conservative while voting for these policies, as well as two \\"unpaid for\\" wars. Columnist Ezra Klein wrote in 2012: \\"If you know about Paul Ryan at all, you probably know him as a deficit hawk. But, Ryan has voted to increase deficits and expand government spending too many times for that to be his north star.\\" Ryan have advocated for spending cuts to help finance the Trump tax cuts, while the President Trump's 2018 budget includes $2.1trillion in spending cuts over ten years to Medicaid, Affordable Care Act subsidies, food stamps, Social Security disability insurance, Supplemental security income, and cash welfare (TANF). =Regulation= In 1999, Ryan voted in favor of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some of the financial regulation of banking from the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act. He sponsored a 2008 bill that would repeal the requirement that the Federal Reserve System work to reduce unemployment. Ryan voted against the Credit CARD Act of 2009 which expanded consumer credit card protection plans. He opposed the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation, characterizing it as \\"class warfare\\". Social, environmental, and science issues Ryan \\"played a central role in nearly all\\" the policy debates of the period 2010-2012. Ryan's non-fiscal policy positions were subject to additional national attention with his 2012 race for Vice President. =Health care, Social Security, and unemployment insurance= Ryan does not believe government subsidized health care is a right or privilege. In 2012, The New York Times said Ryan was \\"his party's most forceful spokesman for cutting entitlement spending.\\" On March 17, 2017, Ryan said \\"Medicaid, sending it back to the states, capping its growth rate\\" was a long-time dream of his. Though he voted for the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, nearly a decade later Ryan said Medicare is on an \\"unsustainable path\\". Ryan voted against the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \\"Obamacare\\", and voted to repeal it in 2012. The Obama and Ryan health care reform plans capped Medicare spending at 0.5% of gross domestic product; while the ACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board to control costs, which Ryan characterized as \\"15 un-elected, unaccountable bureaucrats,\\" Ryan proposed that Congress set reimbursement levels. Ryan supported the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), the House Republican plan to repeal and replace the ACA; after withdrawing the AHCA on the eve of a scheduled March 24, 2017 House vote, the House passed the AHCA on May 4, 2017. Ryan's budget plans proposed privatizing Medicare for those under the age of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on the number of people who qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan's budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021. Ryan voted to extend unemployment insurance in 2002, 2008, and 2009, but has since voted against further extensions. In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose the privatization of Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain the support of the then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a portion of their Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a private account which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals. In 2010 Ryan served on the joint, bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission. He voted with the majority of the Commission not to advance its final report to Congress. Ryan justified his vote claiming that the Commission's recommendations did not do enough to reduce health care costs. Reaction to 2017 AHCA vote Ryan was heavily condemned for his \\"Yes\\" vote on the AHCA, and many of his fundraisers were picketed by ACA supporters. A fundraiser organized by Ryan in Oregon and Representatives Greg Walden (R-OR) and Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA) faced intense protests and chants denouncing Ryan and Walden, though not Herrera Beutler as she had voted against the AHCA. The New York Times wrote that Ryan's vocal support of the bill dealt major damage to his standing with the public, writing \\"Mr. Ryan has emerged from the defeat of the health care bill [AHCA] badly damaged, retaining a job but left to confront the realities of his failure — imperiling the odd-couple partnership that was supposed to sustain a new era of conservative government under unified Republican rule.\\" ThinkProgress called Ryan's support of the AHCA \\"cruel\\" and accused Ryan of having grudges against low-income Americans, stating \\"Ryan has spent his career actively making it harder for low-income parents to do just this — asking them to work more so they can move off public programs.\\" Ryan defended the bill amidst the severe criticism, saying in an interview with George Stephanopoulos that \\"under this bill, no matter what, you cannot be denied coverage if you have a preexisting condition,\\" though Stephanopoulos pointed out several loopholes in the bill that would effectively allow health insurance corporations to charge higher rates for protection of preexisting conditions. Stephanopoulos also identified the major tax cuts within the AHCA that would remove taxes on high-income Americans that were used to fund the ACA. Ryan further defended the AHCA by indicating the provision of the AHCA that would provide block grants to states to fund Medicaid, stating his view that states are more fit for the management of Medicaid rather than the federal government, \\"so by giving states the ability to customize their Medicaid population, their program to work for them.\\" In 2018, actor and comedian Seth Rogen garnered widespread attention following a discussion of an encounter between Rogen and Ryan with Stephen Colbert at a convention about Alzheimer's disease hosted by Mitt Romney. Rogen stated that Ryan's children had asked him for a photo, and he had agreed to take one with them before Ryan appeared and asked him for the same, to which Rogen responded by refusing and openly lambasting Ryan in front of his children, saying \\"I said, 'No way, man!'\\", also telling Ryan \\"Furthermore, I hate what you're doing to the country at this moment and I'm counting the days until you no longer have one iota of the power that you currently have.\\" Rogen stated that he felt \\"conflicted\\" about publicly condemning Ryan in front of his children. Rogen and Colbert also discussed the Trump administration family separation policy and the legalization of marijuana in Rogen's home country of Canada. Though Ryan's \\"Yes\\" vote on the AHCA was not mentioned in the conversation between Rogen and Colbert, the conversation took place in the backdrop of Ryan's declining popularity which had continued following the vote on the AHCA. =Education= Ryan voted for the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001. Ryan is a supporter of for-profit colleges and opposed the gainful employment rule, which would have ensured that vocational schools whose students were unable to obtain employment would stop receiving federal aid. Ryan is a supporter of private school vouchers and voted to extend the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program in 2011. In 2012, Rick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute stated that on \\"education, training, employment, and social services, the Ryan budget would spend 33% less\\" than Obama's budget plan over the next decade. In particular, the Ryan plan tightened eligibility requirements for Pell Grants and froze the maximum Pell Grant award at the then-current level. According to an analysis by the Education Trust, this would have resulted in more than 1 million students losing Pell Grants over the next 10 years. Additionally, under Ryan's plan, student loans would have begun to accrue interest while students were still in school. Ryan stated that his education policy is to \\"allocate our limited financial resources effectively and efficiently to improve education\\". Jordan Weissmann of The Atlantic said that Ryan's vision on education policy is to \\"cut and privatize\\". National Education Association President Dennis Van Roekel criticized Ryan's positions on education in 2012 saying: \\"By selecting Ryan, Romney has doubled down on his view that opportunity is only for those who can afford it or are willing to game the system. He's shown yet again that he is more willing to help the rich get richer than ensuring middle class families get ahead.\\" In December 2015, Ryan led the bipartisan effort to pass the Every Student Succeeds Act, which, among other things, fully repealed No Child Left Behind and severely limited the federal government's ability to impose and enforce national education standards such as Common Core. =Abortion rights and pay equity for women= In 1998, Ryan said he opposed all abortions and favored overturning Roe v. Wade; he believes all abortions should be illegal, including those resulting from rape or incest, and only makes an exception for cases where the woman's life is at risk. During Ryan's 1998 campaign for Congress, he \\"expressed his willingness to let states criminally prosecute women who have abortions,\\" telling the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he \\"would let states decide what criminal penalties would be attached to abortions\\", and while not stating that he supports jailing women who have an abortion, stated: \\"if it's illegal, it's illegal\\". In 2009, he cosponsored the Sanctity of Life Act, which would have extended personhood rights to zygotes. In 2010, Ryan described himself as being \\"as pro-life as a person gets\\" and has been described as an \\"ardent, unwavering foe of abortion rights\\". As of 2012, Ryan had co-sponsored 38 measures in the U.S. Congress that restrict abortion, according to Bloomberg. Ryan has also supported legislation that would impose criminal penalties for certain doctors who perform \\"partial-birth abortions\\". He voted against federal funding for Planned Parenthood and Title X family planning programs. He also opposed giving over-the-counter status for emergency contraceptive pills. Ryan was one of 227 House co-sponsors of the 2011 No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act bill that would have limited funding for federally funded abortions to victims of \\"forcible rape\\". \\"Forcible rape\\" was not defined in the bill, which critics said would result in excluding date rape, statutory rape, or other situations where the victim had diminished mental capacity. The language was removed from the bill before the House passed it; the Senate did not vote on the bill. The National Right to Life Committee has consistently given Ryan a \\"100 percent pro-life voting record\\" since he took office in 1999. In 2012 NARAL Pro-Choice America said that Ryan had \\"cast 59 votes\\" (including procedural motions and amendments which did not have co-sponsors) \\"on reproductive rights while in Congress and not one has been pro-choice\\". Ryan has been rated 0% on the Planned Parenthood Action Fund Scorecard. Ryan voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which would have bolstered women's rights to bring suit to achieve equal pay for equal work, saying \\"[W]e've got to champion small businesses.\\" Ryan has voted multiple times against the House version of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would have helped to address the gender pay gap in the United States. =Same- sex marriage= Ryan opposes same-sex marriage, had previously supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opposed the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against same-sex couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against a bill that would expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation. Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non- Discrimination Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights organization, has frequently given Ryan a 0/100 rating on its legislative scorecard. During Paul Ryan's 2012 vice presidential bid, he was endorsed by two gay conservative organizations, GOProud and the Log Cabin Republicans. On April 30, 2013, Ryan came out in favor of same-sex couples adopting children. Ryan said he had always supported civil unions, and that if the US Supreme Court declares the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, then he believes it will become a federalist issue for states to decide same- sex marriage. =Gun control= Ryan has supported the rights of gun owners and opposed stricter gun control measures. He voted against a bill for stronger background check requirements for purchases at gun shows and supports federal concealed-carry reciprocity legislation, which would allow a person with a permit to carry a concealed firearm in one state to carry a firearm in every other state, a top National Rifle Association (NRA) priority. Ryan is a member of the NRA who owns a rifle and a shotgun, and has received an \\"A\\" rating from the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action and has been endorsed by the Institute every cycle he has been in Congress. =Immigration= In the past, Ryan supported legislation that would have allowed some illegal immigrants to apply for temporary guest-worker status, including one bill that would have provided a pathway to permanent residence status (a Green Card) for such immigrants. However, more recently Ryan \\"has adopted a firm anti-amnesty, enforcement-first stance\\" on illegal immigration. He voted against the DREAM Act, a bill that would have provided conditional permanent residency to illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children provided they attend college or serve in the military, and met other criteria. He also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Ryan has said \\"we must first secure the border and stem the flow of illegal immigration, and then work to increase legal immigration through an enforceable guest worker program\\" before pursuing a \\"piecemeal\\" reform such as the DREAM Act. =Environment= In 2009 Ryan wrote in an op ed that the hacked e-mails from a server at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, also known as \\"Climategate\\", made clear that climatologists \\"use statistical tricks to distort their findings and intentionally mislead the public on the issue of climate change.\\" He opposes cap and trade and opposed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. He criticized the Environmental Protection Agency's classification of carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Ryan is skeptical of the scientific consensus on climate change. On July 30, 2014, at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor in Washington, D. C., he said \\"Climate change occurs no matter what. The question is, can and should the federal government do something about it.(sic) And I would argue the federal government, with all its tax and regulatory schemes, can't.\\" On October 13, 2014, during a debate against Democratic challenger Rob Zerban in Kenosha, Wisconsin both candidates were asked if human activity was to blame for climate change, and Ryan answered: \\"I don't know the answer to that question. I don't think science does, either.\\" Ryan supports a 10-year, $40 billion tax break for the petroleum industry, and has proposed cutting funding for renewable energy research and subsidies. As a legislative and policy aide to Rep. Sam Brownback of Kansas, Ryan opposed subsidies for ethanol fuel production. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV), the Sierra Club, and other environmentalists have criticized Ryan's record on environmental issues, with Ryan earning 3 percent on the LCV 2011 National Environmental Scorecard. =Other= Ryan opposed the Stop Online Piracy Act, stating that \\"it creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse.\\" Ryan favors a constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning. He also voted to withdraw federal funding of NPR. War on Poverty report In February 2013, Ryan began touring low-income neighborhoods and speaking on efforts to reform federal anti-poverty programs. On March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Ryan released a report titled The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later, asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended and that there is little evidence that these efforts have been successful. In the report, Ryan advances the argument that federal antipoverty programs suffer from defects that \\"penalize families for getting ahead\\" and that \\"the complex web of federal programs and sudden drop-off in benefits create extraordinarily high effective marginal tax rates,\\" both of which \\"reduce the incentive to work\\". At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs. In an appendix titled \\"Measures of Poverty\\", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements \\"[have] implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones.\\" According to an article in the Fiscal Times, several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research. Ryan has spoken out against a \\"tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning to value the culture of work.\\" He made the comment during a radio interview with Bill Bennett and initiated it by citing Charles Murray, someone who is famous for propagating claims of black intellectual inferiority compared to other peoples. Foreign and military policy In 2001 and 2004 Ryan voted to end the embargo on Cuba, but later reversed his positions, and, since 2007, has voted for maintaining it. In 2008, he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \\"If we're going to have free trade with China, why not Cuba?\\" In 2009, Ryan termed the Obama administrations' \\"reset\\" of relations with Russia as \\"appeasement\\". Daniel Larison of The American Conservative wrote that Ryan \\"seems to conceive of U.S. power abroad mostly in terms of military strength\\" and \\"truly is a product of the era of George W. Bush\\". Ryan has been described by Larry Sabato as \\"just a generic Republican on foreign policy\\". Ryan is a supporter of Israel.https://twitter.com/speakerryan/status/846370827788541952?lang=en Ryan supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and supported granting fast track authority to President Obama to negotiate the TPP. Ryan was a \\"reliable supporter of the [George W. Bush] administration's foreign policy priorities\\". Ryan voted for the 2002 Iraq Resolution, authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force in Iraq.Jamie Crawford, Ryan's foreign policy views shaped by his budget battles (August 13, 2012). CNN. Ryan also voted for the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. In May 2012, he voted for H.R. 4310, which increased defense spending by $8 billion, including spending for the War in Afghanistan and for weapon systems. In 2012, Ryan explained his support for defense spending sequestration in the hope that this would open common ground with the Democrats on deficit reduction. His comments led defense industry leaders to pin their final hopes on the chance that Congress would at least allow the Pentagon to direct the coming cuts. Ryan supports the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, but opposes the appointment of an independent commission or a special prosecutor.

Its origins can be traced to 1835 when it was founded by Manuel María González Angel, who was subsequently joined by his English agent, Robert Blake Byass. The business was further expanded by the second generation of the González family, amongst them Manuel Críspulo González y Soto. The González family assumed sole control of the business in 1988. The firm produces the fino sherry Tío Pepe. Not only was the González family at the forefront of sherry winemaking, they have also participated in the introduction of the polo game in Spain, the first grass tennis court, the installation of the first electric lighting and running water in the plant, the first train project in Spain as well as numerous other industrial and cultural innovations. In 1862, when Queen Isabel II visited the firm, the construction of a new bodega called La Concha was commissioned from the engineer Gustav Eiffel. In 1963 they constructed the great Tío Pepe bodega, holding 28,000 butts and built on 3 floors. Another bodega was built in 1972, Las Copas, with a capacity of around 80,000 butts. In 1998 the Byass family withdrew from the company. The company is now owned and run by the 4th and 5th generation of the González family, such as Mauricio González-Gordon y Díez. In 2004, González Byass joined forces with Grupo Vips and opened 8 Tio Pepe restaurants in Madrid, but they were closed in 2011 due to the crisis. In 2008 the company acquired the well-known Viñas del Vero wineries. The famous sombrero-wearing, guitar-toting bottle became the classic image of the Tio Pepe brand in 1935. The famous neon sign in Puerta del Sol in Madrid caused a bit of a stir when Apple bought the building and decided that the sign should be removed from the roof (probably to replace it with the Apple logo). The bodega has found another rooftop in the same Puerta del Sol once again and the sign has been reinstalled after renovations. The used barrels from this renowned sherry producer are used by Scotch Whisky producers during the maturation of the premium spirits. Dalmore distillery use 30-year-old barrels in their 18-year-old single malt.

Its aim was to find out what might have happened had Nazi Germany launched Operation Sea Lion, their planned invasion of southeast England during World War II, in September 1940. The wargame was organised by the Daily Telegraph and Dr Paddy Griffith from the Department of War Studies at Sandhurst. The British umpires were Air Chief Marshal Christopher Foxley- Norris, Rear Admiral Teddy Gueritz and Major General Glyn Gilbert. The German umpires were General Adolf Galland (air), Admiral Friedrich Ruge (naval) and General Heinrich Trettner (land). After the game's conclusion, the umpires unanimously concluded that the invasion was a devastating defeat for the German invasion force. Players There were two teams of four players each (Land, Sea, Air, Political): German: Rudolf Rothenfelder, President of the Fighter Pilots Association in Munich and ex-Luftwaffe officer played Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering; Professor Rohwer, Director of the Military Institute in Stuttgart, played Adm. Erich Raeder; and Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch was played by Colonel Wachasmuth, the Bundeswehr liaison officer at the Staff College. The German players were supported by their Defence Attaché in London, Admiral Schuenemann.Griffith, 2009, p. 203 British: British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was played by Brigadier Page, Assistant Commandant of the RMA Sandhurst. The people who played the British Home Forces Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Alan Brooke, and the First Lord of the Admiralty, Dudley Pound, are not recorded. The game had a total of 30 participants. Game preparation and methodology There was \\"a computerised 'Battle of Britain' phase \\"(the computer filled a whole large room...)\\" prior to the start of the game, simulating a continuation of the Luftwaffe assault against RAF airbases in Kent and Sussex; and predicting both the actual extent of British and German aircraft losses, and the (vastly inflated) claimed air victories being reported by German pilots in intelligence reports to the German commanders. Consequently, the German side started with the erroneous intelligence that continued RAF resistance over the South East had only been achieved through stripping fighter units from the rest of the country, and hence that achieving German air superiority was a realistic prospect, sufficient to justify seizing the opportunity offered by likely last fair weather of autumn 1940. By this device, the Game designers were able to justify the counterfactual of Sea Lion being launched, even though actual air superiority had not been achieved. The computerised \\"Battle of Britain\\" preliminaries (programmed by Ivan Collier) lasted several days before the main event. Umpires were allowed to make decisions based on their own intuition (like game masters in a role-playing game) and not in the way wargames are usually played. Preparation involved giving each player a written brief telling them what was known, what was expected of them and how they should behave in the game. Paddy Griffith was the \\"Grand High Umpire.\\" There were six other 'umpires of first recourse': two for land, and one each for railways, sea, air and political. These were: Andy Callan, John Davis, Michael Orr, Dennis Barr, Nigel de Lee and Tony Thomas. They \\"took 'orders' from the playing teams, and usually fed back routine 'reports' locally, without referring them upwards for higher adjudication by the prestigious team of eight international generals and admirals. That happened only when contentious or controversial issues arose that the 'prestigious team' could constructively debate.\\"Griffith, 2009, p. 210 Scenario The game was played using a scale model of southeast England, the English Channel, and northern France. Available troops and resources were based on known plans from both sides, and weather conditions were based on contemporary British Admiralty records that had, until then, never been published. The two actual days of the Game were scheduled to cover up to a week of ‘war’, long enough for the outcome to be evident. The game started on September 19, 1940. It ran for 16 hours straight, over a weekend. Assumptions The scenario assumed: * The German military had taken until September to assemble the shipping necessary for a Channel crossing. * The Luftwaffe continued to attack British airfields after September 7, 1940 instead of bombing London during the day, but despite continuous attacks up to September 19 had not yet established air supremacy; albeit that their intelligence assessments proposed that the RAF was at breaking point.Griffith, 2009, p. 210, note (e) * The Luftwaffe bombed London at night. * The Germans had only converted river barges available as transport ships for the first wave. Not a great deal was known about the invasion fleet at the time of the wargame. This represented a gross simplification relative to shipping plans discovered later, which involved nearly 4,000 vessels, including 150 merchant ships and 237 light or auxiliary close escorts, in four invasion fleets. In the actual shipping plans, the second and third echelons of the first wave; consisting of artillery, vehicles, heavy equipment, stores, horses and reserves of personnel, would have crossed the Channel at the same time as the first echelon. In the Game these follow-up forces were held back to cross on the night of S plus one; and were intercepted at dawn on S plus two by a large force of Royal Navy cruisers and destroyers. * The only ships available to defend the invasion fleet were some U-boats, E-boats and destroyers. * The invasion fleet was largely unmolested in the crossing, as the Royal Navy ships had to steam south from their bases as far away as Scotland to reach the invasion beaches. * The bombing of London would destroy railways between East Anglia and the invasion beaches in Kent and Sussex, so that British troops could not be redeployed quickly. This actually happened on September 7, 1940, when all the railways running south from London were cut and took a long time to repair due to the use (for the first time) of delayed action time bombs. * Operation Herbstreise was enlarged to make 10,000 men available for a landing in East Anglia, northern England, Scotland, or Iceland (in real life there were three divisions of infantry involved). * The Channel Guns had no effect. * The Home Fleet would send its capital ships south. The first two days The game started on September 19, 1940 but the Germans decided that the sea was too rough to attempt a landing. The same happened the next day. The first two days of game time, therefore, consisted of air battles, movement of British units to the south coast, the launching of Operation Herbstreise, and embarkation of German units at the French Channel ports. The Luftwaffe bombed Britain's south coast and laid mines in the Harwich, Humber and Thames estuary waters. The Germans landed their Herbstreise diversion force in Iceland and laid protective minefields in the Channel. The British took full advantage of their intelligence coup (the huge map only showed SE England) and the two day delay by moving four more divisions to Saffron Walden, Newbury, Crowborough and Royal Tunbridge Wells to bolster the nine already in East Anglia, Kent and Sussex. \\"Churchill\\" refused to divert any troops in response to the Iceland invasion. Paddy Griffith was very disappointed with the map, which he says was unnecessary and on which he wasn't consulted. \\"On the day of the game its mere existence had the instant, deeply unfortunate effect of revealing to the British team that the invasion would certainly land in Kent, rather than in East Anglia, or wherever else the umpire team had been trying hard the German's deception plan sound convincing.\\" Griffith, 2009 p. 210, note (b) The map only included the English coast between Portsmouth and Ipswich, and should have at least included East Anglia, as that is where the real British high command expected the invasion. On the afternoon of September 21, the wind dropped, and the forecast for the next day improved. The German protective minefields were finished, stretching out from the North Foreland. The first wave invasion fleets began to form up at dusk, and begin to cross. They were spotted by a British armed trawler at 11pm, The Cromwell warning was issued half an hour later (and the church bells rung), and at midnight the Home Fleet was ordered south. Invasion The German first echelon attack was launched at dawn on 22 September 1940 and consisted of 8,000 airborne troops and 80,000 infantry landed in amphibious operations. The invasion fleet suffered only minor losses to Motor Torpedo Boats, however the Germans lost about 25% of the barges used for the first echlon when these were destroyed on the beaches. During this 24-hour period the Royal Air Force lost 237 aircraft (about 23% of its fighting strength); the Luftwaffe losses amounted to 333, also about 23% of its aircraft. Naval engagements were indecisive at this stage as the Royal Navy was still assembling its main destroyer fleet to attack; but a small force of destroyers, supported by the cruiser HMS Manchester, attempted to reach the invasion beaches from Portsmouth, and were easily sunk by the German destroyer and S-boat escorts. The larger ships of the Royal Navy Home Fleet (including battleships, heavy cruisers and aircraft carriers) were not to be committed due to their vulnerability to air attack and U-boats. The Germans managed to advance a dozen or so miles inland and even captured the ports of Folkestone and Newhaven but the docks at Folkestone had been thoroughly demolished by the British rendering them more or less unusable. British and Commonwealth forces were moved to fully engage in the battle with the first counterattack on 23 September, halting the advance of the Germans towards Hastings and recapturing the western bank of Newhaven. German paratroops were also pinned down by long-range artillery directed onto the captured aerodrome at Lympne by stay-behind forces. At this stage the Germans had few tanks (including amphibious tanks) and only light artillery ashore. An increasing shortage of ammunition was slowly forcing them back towards the sea. The Germans asked \\"Hitler\\" if the nighttime bombing of London could stop and the aircraft used to support the invasion. The request was denied. By dusk on 23 September the Germans had the assault troops 10 divisions ashore, but most were halted by counterattacks, and were awaiting the remainder of their equipment, stores and personnel on the second and third echelons. The second and third echelon barges of the German invasion arrived off the English coast on the morning of 24 September, but only across from Calais and Dunkirk to the beaches in Kent; there would be no follow-up support to the forces ashore in Sussex as there was insufficient aircover and naval defence. At dawn on 24 September the follow-up echelons of German invasion barges were intercepted still 9 miles short of their beach objectives by a Royal Navy fleet of 17 cruisers and 57 destroyers plus Motor Torpedo Boats. 65% of the German barges, three German destroyers and seven E-boats were sunk for the loss of only two British destroyers (sunk by U-boats) plus two cruisers and four destroyers damaged. Some of the accompanying transport ships broke away and headed for Folkestone, but the port was so badly damaged they could only unload two at a time. With the Royal Navy suffering only minor losses, the Home Fleet was ordered to stand by to sail for the English Channel. The German divisions ashore only had enough ammunition for two to seven more days of fighting. Fast steamers and ferries were pressed into service to start an evacuation of German troops from Folkestone and Rye. \\"Hitler\\" ordered the remaining reserves to stand down and prepare for redeployment to Poland. Further British air and sea attacks disrupted the German evacuation over the subsequent four days. The remaining German troops in England finally surrendered on 28 September. Conclusion Although the first echelon landings were more successful than had been anticipated, the German navy's relative weakness, combined with the Luftwaffe's lack of air supremacy, meant they were not able to prevent the Royal Navy from intercepting the second and third echelon Channel crossings. The Navy's destruction of the follow-up echelon forces prevented resupply and reinforcement of the landed troops. This made the position of the initially successful invasion force untenable; it suffered further casualties during the attempted evacuation. Of the 90,000 German troops who landed only 15,400 returned to France. 33,000 were taken prisoner, 26,000 were killed in the fighting and 15,000 drowned in the English Channel. All six umpires deemed the invasion a resounding failure.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kendal, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of six local churches to form the Kirkby Lonsdale Team Ministry. The church contains Norman architecture and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The oldest parts of the church are Norman. Three doorways and the inner north arcades date from the early 12th century, and the base of the tower and the south arcade are from the later part of that century. In the 14th century (or possibly about 1400) the north and south walls of the church were demolished and were rebuilt further outwards, the new south wall incorporating the earlier south doorway. A chantry chapel was added to the northeast of the church in 1486. In the 16th century a new clerestory, pinnacles and battlements were added, and in 1574 an additional aisle was built further north of the existing north aisle. The top of the tower was rebuilt in 1705, and the chantry chapel was demolished at that time. In 1807 the clerestory, battlements and pinnacles were removed by Francis Webster, who added an overall roof. The church was restored in 1866 by E. G. Paley. He raised the roof, giving the outer north aisle a separate roof, reseated the church, re-floored the chancel, added a south porch and installed a screen and a font. Architecture =Exterior= St Mary's is constructed in stone with slate roofs. It is a wide church with a rectangular plan, apart from the south porch. It has a nave and a chancel, one south and two north aisles, a south porch and a west tower embraced by the aisles. There are three Norman doorways, one at the base of the tower, the other two on the south side of the church. The tower is in four stages; the parapets of the tower and the body of the church are embattled. The top stages of the tower are perpendicular. The tower features an oddly-placed clock, which notably wrecks the symmetry of the tower, and is presumed to be a 19th-century addition. The 19th century south porch is in Neo-Norman style. The windows along the side of the church are square-headed and contain differing numbers of lights. The east window consists of three lancets with a vesica above. =Interior= The west part of the arcade between the nave and the inner north aisle is early Norman with round arches; some of its piers have incised decoration similar to that on the piers in Durham Cathedral. The south arcade is later and simpler. To the east ends of the arcades, the arches are pointed. The easternmost pier of the south arcade contains a piscina. The outer north arcade is in Perpendicular style. The pulpit is dated 1619, but has been reduced in size since. The font has been moved from a 14th-century chapel at Killington and is set on a 19th-century base. The reredos is in alabaster with mosaic decoration. Most of the stained glass is by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake, but there are also windows by Heaton, Butler and Bayne (designed by Henry Holiday), by Shrigley and Hunt and by William Wailes. The oldest monument is a tomb chest with an alabaster effigy dating from the 15th century. The two- manual pipe organ was built in the 1860s by Forster and Andrews and rebuilt and enlarged in 1925 by Jardine and Company. It was extensively rebuilt in 1972 by Laycock and Bannister. There is a ring of six bells, all cast in 1825 by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. External features In the churchyard are ten monuments that have been listed at Grade II. To the east of the church is a monument to the Burrow family, dating from the middle of the 18th century. To the south of this is a table tomb from the early 18th century. Also to the east of the church is a monument to John Dent dated 1709, and a table tomb to Rowland Tarham dated 1716. To the south of the church is a monument to two members of the Preston family, the table tomb dated 1775 of Thomas Newby, and a table tomb to members of the Turner family dated in the 1790s. To the west of the church is the table tomb of Thomas Tiffin dated 1787, and a table tomb dated 1818 to Edward Theobalds. Also to the west of the church is a memorial to five women who died in a fire in the Rose and Crown Inn in 1820. To the north of the church is a gazebo, which was formerly in the garden of the vicarage. It is a two-storey octagonal stone structure with round-headed doors and windows, but has lost its former roof.

Malchiel Gruenwald, commonly known as the Kastner trial, was a libel case in Jerusalem, Israel. Hearings were held from 1 January to October 1954 in the District Court of Jerusalem before Judge Benjamin Halevi (1910–1996), who published his decision on 22 June 1955.Maoz (2000) Summary The defendant, Malchiel Gruenwald (1881–1958), a hotelier who lost 52 relatives in the Auschwitz concentration camp, had accused Rudolf Kastner (1906–1957), a Hungarian lawyer and journalist who became a civil servant in Israel in 1947, of collaborating with the Nazis in Hungary during the Holocaust. The allegations were made in a self-published newsletter, Letter to Friends in the Mizrachi, in August 1952. The Israeli government sued on Kastner's behalf, calling him as one of 59 witnesses. Gruenwald was represented by Shmuel Tamir (1923–1987), a former Irgun commander, who turned the case into one that examined the actions of the governing Zionist Mapai party during the Holocaust, and what had been done to help Europe's Jews. One of the key issues was whether Kastner, who in Hungary had helped to found the Budapest Aid and Rescue Committee, had in effect collaborated with Adolf Eichmann (1906–1962) and Kurt Becher (1909–1995), two SS officers, in his efforts to secure safe passage from Budapest to Switzerland in July 1944 of 1,684 Jews, on what became known as the Kastner train. Gruenwald and Tamir accused Kastner of having failed to warn the Hungarian Jewish community that they were to be loaded onto trains and taken to the gas chambers in Auschwitz, in occupied Poland. They alleged that he had known about the gas chambers since at least the end of April 1944 – when he had received a copy of the Vrba-Wetzler report – but had neglected to inform the wider community that they were not being deported from Hungary to be \\"resettled,\\" as the Nazis had said. His motive, they said, was to safeguard the release of a smaller number, which included his family and friends.Linn (2004), p. 41ff. In failing to alert the wider community to the danger, they alleged that he had helped the SS avoid the spread of panic among the Jewish community, which would have slowed down the transports. The judge ruled in Gruenwald's favour, accusing Kastner of having \\"sold his soul to the devil.\\" Kastner was assassinated outside his home in Tel Aviv in March 1957 as a result of the decision and the subsequent publicity.Weitz (1996), pp. 5–7 Appeal Most of the decision was overturned by the Supreme Court of Israel in January 1958. The five judges, Chief Justice Yitzhak Olshan, Shimon Agranat, Moshe Silberg, Shneur Zalman Cheshin, and David Goitein, upheld the appeal on the charge that Kastner was guilty of the indirect murder of Hungarian Jews. Cheshin wrote: \\"On the basis of the extensive and diverse material which was compiled in the course of the hearing, it is easy to describe Kastner as blacker than black and place the mark of Cain on his forehead, but it is also possible to describe him as purer than the driven snow and regard him as 'the righteous of our generation.' A man who exposed himself to mortal danger in order to save others.\\" Four of the judges, with Silberg dissenting, also upheld the appeal on the charge that Kastner was guilty of collaboration. According to Asher Maoz, Silberg agreed with the trial judge that Kastner had \\"knowingly and in bad faith, fulfilled the wishes ... of the Nazis, and thereby made it easier for them to perform the work of mass destruction.\\" All five judges dismissed the appeal related to the charge that Kastner had helped Kurt Becher escape punishment after the war by writing him a letter of recommendation.

Metabolic syndrome (also known as the cardiometabolic syndrome) refers to a cluster of related risk factors for cardiovascular disease that includes abdominal obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol.

Both overweight and obesity are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, specifically heart disease and stroke, and diabetes.

Background  Different definitions of the cardiometabolic syndrome have been proposed by different public health organizations, but recently the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the American Heart Association (AHA), and others proposed a definition for diagnosing the cardiometabolic syndrome that includes the presence of 3 out of the following 5 risk factors: *Fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL, or undergoing drug treatment for elevated glucose *HDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL in men or less than 50 mg/dL in women, or undergoing drug treatment for reduced HDL cholesterol *Triglycerides greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL, or undergoing drug treatment for elevated triglycerides *Waist circumference greater than or equal to 102 cm in men or 88 cm in women (in the United States) *Blood pressure greater than or equal to 130 mm Hg systolic or 85 mm Hg diastolic, or undergoing drug treatment for hypertension Approximately 40 – 46 percent of the world’s adult population has the cluster of risk factors that is metabolic syndrome.Alberti, George, Paul Zimmet, and Johnathan Shaw.

N.p., 28 Nov. 2012. Web. 28 Nov. 2012. . In countries where there are food crises, “much of the foods donated from the international community are calorie-dense foods”, according to Project Hope’s Senior Advisor, Paul Madden. Nutrition education is essential to prevent type 2 diabetes from consuming the continent. The NGO also suggests that in some villages, 70 to 80 percent of the people may not even be aware that they are living with the disease. Studies published in the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism focused on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components in different African populations using various criteria. Reports from Lagos, Nigeria, for instance, showed the prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome as high as over 80% among diabetic patients. The current trend of rising metabolic syndrome in African populations is largely and generally attributed to “adoption of western lifestyle which is characterized by reduced physical activity, substitution of the traditional African diet rich in fruits, and vegetables for the more energy-laden foods”. Europe  Currently, more than 55 million people in Europe have been diagnosed with diabetes, according to the IDF; by 2030 this total will rise to 64 million people.\\"Diabetes at a Glance, 2012 Europe.\\" IDF Europe - Diabetes Update Fact Sheet. International Diabetes Federation - IDF Europe, n.d. Web. 30 Nov. 2012. . Roughly 8.4% of adults are suffering from the effects of this disease, which caused 622,114 deaths in the region this year.33 IDF studies have also concluded that Europe has the highest number of children with type 1 diabetes. The European Global Cardiometabolic Risk Profile in Patients with Hypertension Disease (GOOD) survey investigated the cardiometabolic risk profile in adult patients with hypertension across 289 locations in four European regions. Across the Northwest, Mediterranean, Atlantic European Mainland and Central Europe zones, demographic, lifestyle, clinical and laboratory data were collected from eligible patients during one clinic visit. In Central Europe 44% of the participants had type 2 diabetes compared with 33% in the Atlantic European Mainland, and 26% in the Northwest and the Mediterranean regions. The study revealed a prevalence of metabolic syndrome affected 68% of Central Europe, 60% of the Atlantic European Mainland, 52% of the Mediterranean regions and 50% of Northwest Europe. Fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were all highest in Central Europe compared with the other three regions. Roughly 80% of the Atlantic European Mainland patients had uncontrolled blood pressure, whereas the other three regions tallied approximately 70-71%. Compared to the Northwest, Mediterranean, and Central Europe regions, declared alcohol consumption was also recorded the highest in the Atlantic European Mainland; exercise was lowest in Central Europe. The GOOD survey recorded cases of congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery disease and stable/unstable angina were highest in Central Europe compared with the other regions. Family history of premature stroke or myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization and transient ischaemic attacks had the highest prevalence in the Atlantic European Mainland. Statistical conclusions indicate that hypertensive patients across Europe exhibit multiple cardiometabolic risk factors, with greater predominance in Central Europe and the Atlantic European Mainland compared with Northwest and Mediterranean regions. Middle East and North Africa  The International Diabetes Federation reports more than 34.2 million people in the Middle East and North Africa have diabetes; this number will rise to 59.7 million by the year 2030 unless counteractive measures are introduced.\\"Diabetes at a Glance, 2012 Middle East and North Africa.\\" IDF MENA - Diabetes Update Fact Sheet. International Diabetes Federation - IDF MENA, n.d. Web. 30 Nov. 2012. . In 2012, diabetes caused 356,586 deaths in this region, a zone with the highest prevalence of diabetes in adults (11%) in the world. Turkey reported a prevalence of 33.9% for metabolic syndrome (MS), with a higher prevalence in women (39.6%) than in men (28%). The survey included random samples from both urban and rural populations in seven geographical regions of Turkey. More than one-third (35.08%) of the participants were obese. Of those tested, 13.66% had hypertension, while those with diabetes mellitus (DM) and MS were 4.16% and 17.91%, respectively. The frequency of hypertension, MS and obesity were higher in females than males; however, DM was higher in males than females. According to the IDF, metabolic syndrome was prevalent in 16.1% of the Saudi Arabian population. In Tunisia, metabolic syndrome incidence was 45.5% based on the IDF criteria. 37.4% of Iranians aging from 25-64, living in both urban and rural areas of all 30 provinces in Iran, had MS (based on the IDF definition); results based on the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII)/American Heart Association (AHA)/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) standards suggest 41.6% of the same group of Iranians suffer from metabolic syndrome. The affliction of the MS is estimated to affect more than 11 million Iranians. North America and the Caribbean  Current IDF data proposes more than 38.4 million people in North American and the Caribbean have diabetes and projects this number will increase to 51.2 million by 2030.\\"Diabetes at a Glance, 2012 North America and Caribbean.\\" IDF NAC - Diabetes Update Fact Sheet. International Diabetes Federation - IDF NAC, n.d. Web. 30 Nov. 2012. . In 2012, 11% of (or approximately 4.2 million) adults in the NAC Region endured the disease; this year, diabetes was responsible for 287,020 deaths in North America. The National Center for Biotechnological Information notes the incidence of the metabolic syndrome among Caribbean-born persons in the U. S. Virgin Islands is comparable to that among the population on the mainland of the United States. The groups involved in the study were Hispanic white, Hispanic black, non-Hispanic black born in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and non-Hispanic black born elsewhere in the Caribbean. Hispanic ethnicity was independently associated with an increased risk of having the metabolic syndrome, high triglycerides, and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Among Caribbean-born persons living in the U.S. Virgin Islands, those who are Hispanic blacks may have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease than do other groups. =United States = Approximately 27 million Americans, or nearly 11% of the population, have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National diabetes fact sheet, 2011. Available at https://www.cdc.gov. Accessed November 9, 2012. By 2050, the prevalence of diabetes could increase to as much as 33% of the population, largely due to the aging of the population and to people with diabetes living longer.Boyle JP et al. Projection of the year 2050 burden of diabetes in the U.S. adult population: dynamic modeling of incidence, mortality, and prediabetes prevalence. Popul Health Metr. 2010; 8:1-12. Approximately 1.9 million new cases of diabetes are diagnosed each year. The disease was the seventh leading cause of death in 2007, directly claiming more than 71,000 lives and contributing to approximately 160,000 additional deaths. Patients with diabetes are two to four times more likely than those without it to die from cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is an important cause of blindness, kidney disease, and lower-extremity amputations.

Obesity and overweight. Available at http://www.who.int. Accessed November 9, 2012.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overweight and obesity. Available at https://www.cdc.gov. Accessed November 9, 2012. Obese individuals are at twice the risk of dying from any cause than normal-weight individuals. The prevalence of obesity and overweight have risen to epidemic proportions in the United States, where 67% of adults are overweight and, of these, approximately half are obese. The prevalence of hypertension, another cardiometabolic syndrome component, has been increasing for the last decade. In 1994, 24% of U.S. adults had hypertension. Today, that figure has risen to 29%, according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.Yoon SS et al. Hypertension among adults in the United States, 2009-2010. NCHS Data Brief. 2012;82:1-8. In addition, nearly 30% of U.S. adults have prehypertension. Hypertension increases one’s risk of suffering a stroke, developing end-stage renal disease, and dying from cardiovascular disease. In recent years, hypertension has directly claimed more than 61,000 U.S. lives and has contributed to approximately 347,000 deaths each year. Of the components of the cardiometabolic syndrome, only the prevalence of dyslipidemia has declined in the United States. Between 1999 and 2010, the percentage of U.S. adults with high total cholesterol declined from approximately 18% to 13%.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cholesterol: facts and statistics. Available at https://www.cdc.gov. Accessed November 9, 2012. However, according to the American Heart Association, nearly half of U.S. adults today (44%) are still at increased risk for atherosclerotic disease because their levels of total cholesterol are elevated (200 mg/dL or higher). Of these 98.8 million individuals with elevated cholesterol, 33.6 million have high cholesterol (240 mg/dL or above), and 71.3 million have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 130 mg/dL or higher. In addition, approximately 19% of U.S. adults have low levels of high- density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and one-third have elevated triglycerides. Finally, dyslipidemia affects the vast majority (up to 97%) of individuals with diabetes and contributes to their elevated risk for cardiovascular disease.American Diabetes Association. Diabetic dyslipidemia. Diabetes & Cardiovascular Disease Review. 2006;3:1-4. =United states children= According to estimates from the American Heart Association, more than 9% of U.S. children and adolescents aged 12–19, or nearly three million individuals, have the metabolic syndrome. Among overweight and obese adolescents, this prevalence rate rises to 44%. Two-thirds of adolescents have at least one metabolic abnormality. Preliminary prospective studies report that children and adolescents with the metabolic syndrome are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes as adults. One 25-year prospective study found that, compared with children without the syndrome, those with the metabolic syndrome are 14 times more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease and 11 times more likely to develop diabetes when they reach adulthood.Schubert CM et al. Predictive ability of childhood metabolic components for adult metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. J Pediatr. 2009; 155(Suppl):S1-S7. Cardiometabolic risk among children and adolescents is fueled by the rising prevalence of obesity in this age group. From 1980 to 2008, rates of obesity have increased from 5% to 10% among preschool children aged 2–5. During the same time period, obesity increased from 6.5% to nearly 20% among 6-11year-olds and from 5% to 18% among adolescents aged 12–19.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents: United States, trends 1963-1965 through 2007-2008. Available at https://www.cdc.gov. Accessed November 9, 2012. Hypertension among children and adolescents has increased by 1% since 1999 and is estimated to affect 3.6% of those aged 3–18. This increase is attributed to the rising number of overweight and obese children. The prevalence of lipid abnormalities among children and adolescents is also tied to obesity and overweight. Approximately 14% of normal-weight youths aged 12–19 have lipid abnormalities. That figure rises to 22% of overweight youths and nearly 43% of obese youths. Obesity is also tied to the rise of type 2 diabetes among U.S. children. Until recently, diabetes in children was typically assumed to be type 1, formerly known as juvenile-onset diabetes.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children and diabetes: SEARCH for diabetes in youth. Available at https://www.cdc.gov. Accessed November 9, 2012. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recent clinical evidence indicates that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is increasing among American children and adolescents. This increase is most notable among Blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and American Indians. Children who develop type 2 diabetes are typically overweight or obese. “Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents already appears to be a sizable and growing problem,” the CDC says. “Better physician awareness and monitoring of the disease’s magnitude will be necessary.” = Native Americans (American Indians) = The National Cholesterol Education Program compiled and presented data from the Indian Health Service that indicates increasing mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease vary among American Indian communities. The significant independent predictors of CVD in Native American women were diabetes, age, obesity, LDL, albuminuria, triglycerides, and hypertension.Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) Final Report. Rep. N.p.: NIH, 2002. 02-5215. National Cholesterol Education Program, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Sept. 2002. Web. 29 Nov. 2012. <>. In men the significant predictors of CVD were diabetes, age, LDL, albuminuria, and hypertension. Unlike other ethnic groups, Native Americans appear to have an increasing frequency of coronary heart disease, possibly related to the high and increasing prevalence of diabetes in these communities. Although total and LDL-cholesterol levels are lower than the U.S. average, importance of LDL cholesterol as a contributor to CHD in this group should not be underestimated. Moreover, because of the high frequency of type 2 diabetes, many Native Americans will have an even lower LDL goal. The evidence for differences in baseline risk between Native American and white populations is not strong enough to justify separate guidelines for Native American populations. South and Central America  The IDF reports 9.2% of adults in the South and Central America have diabetes and 12.3% of deaths in adults in the SACA Region can be attributed to the disease.\\"Diabetes at a Glance, 2012 South and Central America.\\" IDF SACA - Diabetes Update Fact Sheet. International Diabetes Federation - IDF SACA, n.d. Web. 30 Nov. 2012. < http://www.idf.org/sites/default/files/IDF_SACA_5E_Update_FactSheet.pdf >. More than 26.4 million people in the SACA Region have diabetes; by 2030 this will rise to 39.9 million. Approximately 236,328 disease related fatalities occurred in the SACA Region in 2012. The Latin American populations exhibit a high prevalence of abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome, similar or even higher than developed countries. It is attributed to changes in their lifestyle, migration from rural to urban areas and a higher susceptibility to accumulate abdominal fat and develop more insulin resistance compared to other ethnically different populations. Some genetic factors and metabolic adaptations during fetal life can be claimed as etiological factors of this condition. Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the majority of the countries in Latin America, few data about regional differences on this topic has emerged. Developing countries have scarce epidemiological data on cardiovascular (CV) risk factor prevalence, which only allows for limited control and treatment options.\\"Diabetes at a Glance, 2012 South-East Asia.\\" IDF SEA - Diabetes Update Fact Sheet. International Diabetes Federation - IDF SEA, n.d. Web. 30 Nov. 2012. . The load of the CV risk factors, especially hypertension, remains uncertain. South-East Asia  A 2012 IDF South-East Asia report states one fifth of all adults living with diabetes live in South East Asia and 8.7% of adults in the region endure the disease, according to the International Diabetes Federation. As of this 2012, 70.3 million people in the SEA Region have diabetes; by 2030 this will rise to 120.9 million diagnoses. There has been special interest in South Asians because they have been reported to have very high frequency rates of coronary heart disease at younger ages in the absence of traditional risk factors. The higher CHD risk in this population may be related in part to a higher prevalence of insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Lipoprotein levels have also been reported to be elevated, elevating the importance of initiating remedies to reduce cholesterol and other CHD risk factors in this group with South Asian Indian ancestry. A growing body of evidence indicates that South Asians are at high baseline risk for CHD, compared to American whites; they are particularly at risk for the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Also, increased emphasis should be given to life habit changes to mitigate the metabolic syndrome in this population. All other data reflects cholesterol management guidelines should remain the same for the SEA population as well as for other population groups. Western Pacific  The IDF Western pacific reports more people with diabetes live in the Western Pacific than any other region in the world.\\"Diabetes at a Glance, 2012 Western Pacific.\\" IDF WP - Diabetes Update Fact Sheet. International Diabetes Federation - IDF WP, n.d. Web. 30 Nov. 2012. . Approximately 132.2 million people in the WP Region have diabetes; if proper precautions are not utilized, this number is projected to escalate to 187.9 million people by 2030. 44 8% of all Western Pacific adults have diabetes and in 2012, the illness caused 1.7 million deaths in the Western Pacific. There is limited information on the risks and benefits of lipid management for reduction of coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this population. In the Honolulu Heart Program report, CHD and CVD mortality rates are lower than in the general U.S. population. However, the evidence for differences between Pacific Islander and general U.S. Populations is not strong enough to justify the creating of separate guidelines.

Its seat and largest settlement is Tolmin. History In ancient times the area was inhabited by the Illyrians and then by the Romans. In the 6th century the Slavs, ancestors of present-day Slovenes, settled the area. Until 1420 it belonged to the Patriarchate of Aquileia, when it was acquired by the Republic of Venice. In 1514 it became a possession of the Habsburgs, who gave it as fief to the Coronini-Cronberg family. Medieval documents testify to a long series of uprisings, culminating in the Tolmin peasant revolt of 1713. That particular insurgence spread from Tolmin County to the Vipava Valley, Karst, and Brda, and further on to northern Istria. The uprising was mercilessly crushed by the imperial army and its eleven leaders were beheaded. In the 16th century, the area became part of the County of Gorizia and Gradisca. During the World War I, Tolmin served as a base for the victorious breach of the Soča/Isonzo Front. Occupied by Italian troops at the end of 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Italy between 1918 and 1943 (nominally to 1947) as a commune of the Province of Gorizia (as Tolmino), except during the period between 1924 and 1927, when the Province of Gorizia was abolished and annexed to the Province of Udine. Tolmin was during Italian Rule and between 1943 and 1945 of the Nazi German Operational Zone Adriatic Coast. In 1945 it was liberated by the Yugoslav Partisans and in 1947 it was officially annexed to Yugoslavia. Since then, it has been an integral part of Slovenia. Geography The Tolmin area includes the Tolminka and Zadlaščica basins at the entrance to Triglav National Park, which are also its lowest point (). A special feature of the Tolminka Basins is a thermal spring at the end of the path. The region also boasts several record-holding waterfalls (Brinta Falls, and Gregorčič Falls, ) and several other smaller waterfalls hidden in the ravines of Cold Creek (), Godiča Creek, Pščak Creek, and Sopotnica Creek. =Settlements= In addition to the municipal seat of Tolmin, the municipality also includes the following settlements: *Bača pri Modreju *Bača pri Podbrdu *Bukovski Vrh *Čadrg *Čiginj *Daber *Dolenja Trebuša *Dolgi Laz *Dolje *Drobočnik *Gabrje *Gorenja Trebuša *Gorenji Log *Gorski Vrh *Grahovo ob Bači *Grant *Grudnica *Hudajužna *Idrija pri Bači *Kal *Kamno *Kanalski Lom *Klavže *Kneške Ravne *Kneža *Koritnica *Kozaršče *Kozmerice *Kuk *Lisec *Ljubinj *Logaršče *Loje *Modrej *Modrejce *Most na Soči *Obloke *Pečine *Petrovo Brdo *Podbrdo *Podmelec *Polje *Poljubinj *Ponikve *Porezen *Postaja *Prapetno *Prapetno Brdo *Roče *Rut *Sela nad Podmelcem *Sela pri Volčah *Selce *Selišče *Šentviška Gora *Slap ob Idrijci *Stopnik *Stržišče *Temljine *Tolminske Ravne *Tolminski Lom *Trtnik *Volarje *Volčanski Ruti *Volče *Žabče *Zadlaz–Čadrg *Zadlaz–Žabče *Zakraj *Zatolmin *Znojile Culture Tolmin has been the venue for the Metaldays heavy metal festival, Punk Rock Holiday, and Soča Reggae Riversplash festival. Politics The Municipality of Tolmin is governed by a mayor elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council of 22 members. The local political scene is relatively diversified, with no prevalence of a particular party, although the conservative New Slovenia and Slovenian People's Party tend to receive a higher proportion of votes than their national average. Traditionally, the left-wing and liberal parties have been stronger in the town center, whereas the countryside tends to favor conservative parties. In national politics, the Tolmin electoral district has highly favored the conservative Slovenian Democratic Party, but this is largely due to the prevalence of this party in the other two municipalities forming the district, (Bovec and Kobarid).

Written by Ryan Murphy and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, it aired on Fox in the United States on October 4, 2012, and features the end of several long-established romantic relationships on the show: the couples Finn and Rachel, Kurt and Blaine, Santana and Brittany all break up. Plot In New York City, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) reunites with her former fiancé, Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), who has been discharged from the Army, and gives him a tour through the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA), causing Finn to feel out of place. Meanwhile, in Lima, Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), feeling neglected by his boyfriend, Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), who is busy with his work at Vogue.com, cheats on him. Finn and Blaine sing Duncan Sheik's \\"Barely Breathing\\" and Blaine, feeling guilty, decides to surprise Kurt by visiting him in New York City. Finn, Rachel, Kurt and Blaine attend a local bar where NYADA students meet, and where Finn runs into Brody Weston (Dean Geyer). Suspicious of his and Rachel's relationship, Finn encourages them to sing Demi Lovato's \\"Give Your Heart a Break\\" together. They are followed by Blaine, who performs a heartfelt acoustic version of Katy Perry's \\"Teenage Dream.\\" Outside, Finn and Kurt confront Rachel and Blaine, and Rachel admits to kissing Brody, while Blaine admits to cheating on Kurt, leading to them singing No Doubt's \\"Don't Speak\\" as they return to Rachel and Kurt's apartment. The following day, Finn leaves without telling Rachel and returns to Lima, where he visits glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and breaks down in his arms. Finn is introduced to the new members of New Directions and suggests that they perform Grease for the school musical, which impresses Will. Will later tells Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), that he has been accepted to the blue ribbon government panel to improve arts education nationwide, but that it requires him to move to Washington, D.C. for six months. Emma is reluctant to leave Lima for such a long time to accompany Will, and they argue, but do not break up. Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) visits her girlfriend, Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), and learns that she joined a club created by cheerleader Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) to prepare for the rapture. Kitty's boyfriend, Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), invites Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) to one of the meetings, but becomes disappointed when Kitty uses it to play a harmful prank on one of the members. Jake eventually decides to break up with Kitty after she mistreats Marley, but also ignores Marley's romantic advances. Santana serenades Brittany with Taylor Swift's \\"Mine\\" and confides with Brittany that their relationship isn't working due to the long distance and her new priorities. She and Brittany break up, which leaves Brittany devastated. Blaine continuously attempts to contact Kurt, but Kurt won't communicate with him, and he becomes uncertain of where they're standing. Rachel, having flown all the way to Lima, confronts Finn at the McKinley auditorium, where she calls him immature and a coward for hiding from her for months. She says she loves him, but states that she can't keep their current relationship up, and she breaks up with him despite Finn's claims that he was giving her freedom. She gives him a last kiss, and leaves. After she leaves, Finn performs Coldplay's \\"The Scientist\\" alone, and imagines that Rachel, Kurt, Blaine, Santana, Brittany, Will and Emma are there performing with him. Production In a July 2012 interview with E! News, Colfer elaborated in regard to the progression of the Kurt-Blaine relationship in the show's fourth season. Colfer said, \\"I would like to do something besides say 'I love you,' and I think Darren [Criss] and I agree on that. We're ready for the next step. They've been together for a while. Let's throw some spice and drama into that.\\" Colfer quipped that he did not know what was in store for the couple, \\"I hear mixed things. I hear they're still together but then maybe they're breaking up.\\" In a September 2012 interview with the same publication, on whether the couple would break up or not in the show's fourth season, Criss stated, \\"I don't know. We still have episodes to shoot.\\" Criss ultimately echoed Colfer's sentiment, \\"We're like an old married couple now. Let's shake it up!\\" Prior to the episode's debut, series co-creator Ryan Murphy dubbed it \\"the best episode we have ever done\\". Scenes from the episode were filmed on location in New York City the weekend of August 11 and 12, 2012, including the walk through the park for the song \\"Don't Speak\\". Recurring characters in this episode include McKinley guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Mays), glee club members Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen), Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell), Marley Rose (Benoist) and Jake Puckerman (Artist), cheerleader Kitty (Tobin), NYADA junior Brody Weston (Geyer) and Vogue.com employee Chase Madison (Dan Domenech). Six songs are being released as singles, including Duncan Sheik's \\"Barely Breathing\\" performed by Criss and Monteith, No Doubt's \\"Don't Speak\\" performed by Colfer, Criss, Monteith and Michele, Coldplay's \\"The Scientist\\" performed by Monteith, Michele, Colfer, Criss, Rivera, Morris, Morrison and Mays, Demi Lovato's \\"Give Your Heart a Break\\" performed by Michele and Geyer, Taylor Swift's \\"Mine\\" performed by Rivera, and an acoustic version of Katy Perry's \\"Teenage Dream\\" performed by Criss.

It posits that all and only sentient beings have intrinsic value and moral standing, thus they are regarded as moral patients, while the rest of the natural world only has instrumental value. Both humans and other sentient individuals have rights and/or interests that must be considered. Sentiocentrists consider discrimination between sentient beings of different species to be speciesism, an arbitrary discrimination. Coherent sentiocentrist belief respects all sentient beings. Many self-described humanists see themselves as \\"sentientists\\" where the term humanism contrasts with theism and does not describe the sole focus of humanist concerns.  History of concept  Utilitarianism accepts sentiocentrism, thus granting all sentient beings moral concern, where sentient beings are those that have the capacity for experiencing positive or negative conscious states. The 18th-century utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham was among the first to argue for sentiocentrism in his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, where he made a comparison between slavery and sadism toward humans and non-human animals: The late 19th- and early 20th-century American philosopher J. Howard Moore, in Better World Philosophy (1899), described every sentient being as existing in a constant state of struggle. He argued that what aids them in their struggle can be called good and what opposes them can be called bad. Moore believed that only sentient beings can make such moral judgements because they are the only parts of the universe which can experience pleasure and suffering. As a result, he argued that sentience and ethics are inseparable and therefore every sentient piece of the universe has an intrinsic ethical relationship to every other sentient part, but not the insentient parts. Moore used the term \\"zoocentricism\\" to describe the belief that universal consideration and care should be given to all sentient beings; he believed that this was too difficult for humans to comprehend in their current stage of development. Other prominent philosophers discussing or defending sentiocentrism include Peter Singer, Tom Regan, and Mary Anne Warren. Sentiocentrism is a term contained in the Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare, edited by Marc Bekoff and Carron A. Meaney.  Justification  Peter Singer provides the following justification of sentiocentrism: In line with the above, Utilitarian philosophers such as Singer not only care about the wellbeing of humans, but also about the wellbeing of sentient non-human animals. Utilitarians reject speciesism, the discrimination of individuals on the basis of their species membership. Drawing an analogy between speciesism and other forms of arbitrary discrimination, Peter Singer writes that  Gradualism  In the animal kingdom, there is a gradation in the nervous complexity,List of animals by number of neurons taking examples from the marine sponges that lack neurons, intestinal worms with ~ 300 neurons or humans with ~ 86 billion. While the existence of neurons is not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of sentience in an animal, it is a necessary condition. Without neurons, there is no place where it can happen (and the fewer the neurons, the lower the maximum capacity for intelligence in an organism). Gradualist sentiocentrism states that more complex interests deserve more consideration than less complex moral interests. One implication of this premise is that the best interests of a simple organism do not deserve consideration before the non-best interest in a complex organism (e.g., a dog with intestinal worms should be healed even though this results in the death of the parasites). Note that this does not lead to the rejection of interests of complex animals (such as pigs) versus the human desire to feed on them. This is a vision that expands to areas that are not only relevant to other species, but to uniquely human issues, as is the case on the legalization of abortion. Gradualism poses a greater consideration of the mother against the fetus in question, given that the latter does not have the ability for complex interests in the early stages of gestation. An emblematic case in this debate is the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who says that \\"a human embryo in early-stage, without nervous system and presumably lacking pain and fear, could justifiably be afforded less moral protection than an adult pig, which it is clearly well equipped to suffer\\". As a fetus progresses they gain sentience until \\"the majority of neurons are already present in our brains by the time we are born\\". Since a 9-month fetus is nearing the mother's level of sentience, a sentiocentrist may, therefore, believe that greater rights should be afforded to a 9-month fetus than a 1-month fetus (if any). Late-term abortions should then require much greater justification under the law than a 6-week abortion, which may not require any justification under the law. For example, \\"psycho-social\\" justifications are often viewed as valid reasons for aborting a fetus with little-to-no sentience, but it may take \\"medical necessity\\" to justify killing a fetus with a level of sentience approaching that of their mother.

Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division, 358 U.S. 103 (1958), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court interpreted the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) as allowing a gas supply company to unilaterally modify a rate in a natural gas supply contract if the contract specified that the rate was that of the rate schedule filed with the Federal Power Commission (FPC) and the gas company filed a new rate schedule.. This case clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine established by United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp. (1956). and its companion case Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co. (1956),. which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be \\"just and reasonable\\" and thus acceptable under the NGA or Federal Power Act (FPA). Background The NGA was enacted in 1938 to regulate the interstate natural gas industry, including gas pipeline companies. The NGA regulated the rates charged by gas companies to their customers, which included local gas distribution companies and industrial users, through the filing by gas companies of rate schedules and contracts with customers. The NGA required gas companies to file tariffs of their new rates with the FPC, a federal administrative agency, at least thirty days prior to their becoming effective, and authorized the FPC to investigate rates to determine if they were in the public interest. The FPC could also suspend rates except for those involving gas supplied to industrial users while the investigating the rates. The United Gas Pipe Line Co., a natural gas pipeline company that operated in several states and was subject to regulation under the NGA, provided gas under long term contracts to distribution companies such as the Texas Gas Transportation Corp., Southern Natural Gas Co., and the Mississippi Valley Gas Co. The Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division (MLGW), a distribution system in Memphis, Tennessee, purchased gas from Texas Gas under a contract in which MLGW was required to reimburse Texas Gas for any increases in the cost of gas provided by United Gas. Each of these contracts had a clause which specified that the rate for the gas was that on the United Gas rate schedule on file with the FPC or any effective rate schedule. On September 30, 1955, United Gas filed a new rate schedule with the FPC which proposed to increase the contract rates. The FPC suspended the rates as provided in the NGA and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the lawfulness of the new rate schedule. The distribution companies and MLG&W; intervened in the proceeding. After the Supreme Court issued its Mobile Gas decision which held that the unilateral filing of a new rate schedule could not abrogate a gas contract with a specified rate on February 27, 1956, the distribution companies and MLGW moved to dismiss the new rate schedule. The FPC upheld the new rate schedule on the basis that the distribution companies had contracted to essentially pay the \\"going\\" rate on the effective United Gas rate schedule, and distinguished Mobile Gas as applying to gas contracts with a fixed rate. The distribution companies and MLGW appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which then reversed the FPC in an opinion which held that Mobile Gas had established that the FPC could review the new rate schedule only if the customers of a gas company consented to the filing of the schedule. The Supreme Court granted certiorari based on a claim that the Court of Appeals misunderstood the Memphis Gas decision. Opinion In a majority opinion by Justice Harlan, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, stating that it \\"misconceived\\" the Mobile Gas decision. Mobile Gas involved contracts to supply gas at a specific price, and the NGA did not permit a gas pipeline company to abrogate the contract by filing a new rate schedule. In Memphis, United Gas and the distribution companies had agreed in the contract that the price would be the current \\"going\\" rate, which left United Gas able to revise the rate by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC subject only to review for lawfulness under the NGA. The Court explained that in allowing gas companies and customers to determine gas rates through contracts in the NGA, Congress was indicating that the public interest not only required protection of customers from excessive gas costs, but also recognized the legitimate interest of natural gas companies. The opinion staed that natural gas companies, in order to protect their ability to access financial markets, must be able to raise rates in order to fund the maintenance of gas systems and its expansion through debt and securities. This was a proper concern of Congress in enacting the NGA as noted in Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co. (1944).. Lastly, the opinion noted that \\"going\\" rate contracts were common, and the ability of gas companies to revise the \\"going\\" rate by filing new rate schedules had not previously been considered to be an issue. Justice Douglas in his dissenting opinion stated that it had been his understanding that Mobile Gas required that rates in gas contracts could only be revised under the NGA with the agreement of the parties, which would include the customers. In Memphis, the oral argument before the Supreme Court on behalf of the FPC was made by U.S. Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin. Subsequent events A motion for rehearing of the decision was denied by the Supreme Court in 1959.. Although the dissenting opinion in Memphis suggested that the decision would \\"make a shambles\\" of the administration of the NGA as far as customer interests were concerned, the Supreme Court did not find it necessary to rule on issues involving the Mobile-Sierra doctrine for another fifty years. In Morgan Stanley Capital Group v. Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County, Washington (2008),. the Court held that the restrictions against the modification of contracts also applied to customers with unfavorable rates. One reference describes the Mobile Gas, Sierra Power, and Memphis cases as the first chapter of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, with Morgan Stanley as the second chapter and NRG Power Marketing, LLC v. Maine Public Utilities Commission (2010). as the third. On October 1, 1977, the FPC was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission..

Barnbow was Britain's top shell factory between 1914 and 1918, and by the end of the war on 11 November 1918, a total of 566,000 tons of ammunition had been shipped overseas.  Second World War  =Conversion to an Engineering ROF= In the late 1930s, war was seen as a possibility, if not likely, and a sizeable rearmament programme began, probably also activated by the concern that a large proportion of the arsenal was becoming obsolete.

The site also built lighter vehicles with aluminium armour, such as the Fox armoured reconnaissance vehicle and the FV180 Combat Engineer Tractor. The Challenger was built by the Royal Ordnance Factories (ROF). In 1986, ROF Leeds (and the Challenger production line) was acquired by Vickers Defence Systems (later Alvis Vickers). Privatisation of Royal Ordnance On 2 January 1985, Vesting day, the twelve ROFs that still remained open, plus the Waltham Abbey South site, RSAF Enfield and three Agency Factories, became a UK Government-owned company: Royal Ordnance plc. Its headquarters was moved to ROF Chorley, Lancashire; with its registered office located in central London. The intention of the government at this stage was to privatise Royal Ordnance as soon as possible through a stock market flotation. In mid-1985 a target date of July 1986 was set; however, by June 1986 the government announced that flotation would not be possible and that it intended to sell the company privately. The following problems were identified as barriers to a flotation: *The future of ROF Leeds, notably the uncertain future due to over-capacity in UK main battle tank production. *The future relationship between the MOD and the company. *The financial position of the company. *Liabilities regarding a contract with British Aerospace The problems associated with ROF Leeds were solved when Royal Ordnance agreed the sale of the factory and intellectual property rights of the Challenger tanks to Vickers plc on 4 October 1986, the final agreement was signed on 31 March 1987 valuing ROF Leeds at £15.2 million. Vickers became Alvis Vickers and, in 2004, became part of BAE Systems, and the Leeds factory was closed. The relationship with the MOD was resolved by certain guarantees given to the company by the MOD regarding future procurement strategies. The financial position of the company was resolved by a Treasury cash injection and the proceeds of the ROF Leeds sale. The liabilities were with regard to a sub- contract for a missile systems between British Aerospace (BAe) and an MOD research establishment transferred to Royal Ordnance on Incorporation; BAe and the MOD reached agreement in February 1987. Bids for Royal Ordnance Plc were invited in October 1986, resulting in six offers. These were eventually reduced to two; one from British Aerospace and one from Guest, Keen & Nettlefolds (GKN).

The program is best known for a previous offering of unlimited travel on American Airlines and unlimited access to Admirals Club locations. Pass holders were offered terms of five years or lifetime. Today the program no longer offers lifetime or unlimited travel focusing instead on pre-paid fares at a discounted, fixed price for frequent travelers. A minimum commitment of $10,000 per traveler, per year is required. Existing unlimited AAirpasses remain valid. Program The program (now re-branded as AirPass) initially enabled passholders unlimited first class travel on any of the airline's flights worldwide. Lifetime membership was priced at $250,000, with the option to purchase a companion pass for an additional $150,000. A total of 66 AAirpasses are reported to have been sold under the unlimited travel conditions, with businessman Michael Dell, baseball player Willie Mays, and America's Cup- winner Dennis Conner among those who purchased the passes. The program was launched at a time when the airline was struggling financially and in need of a quick infusion of cash. The cost of the pass was $250,000 when launched in 1981 (), this increased to $600,000 in 1990 (), and $1.01 million in 1993 (equivalent to $ million in ). The airline ended sales of the unlimited passes in 1994 except for a one-time offer in the 2004 Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog at a price of $3 million for the pass and $2 million for a companion pass; none were sold. Profitability investigations In 2007, during a period of financial instability for the airline, American Airlines assigned a \\"revenue integrity unit\\" to investigate AAirpass holders. The airline's investigators concluded that two AAirpass holders, Steven Rothstein and Jacques Vroom, were costing the airline more than $1 million annually. The airline points to accumulation of air miles for flights which they received for free under the AAirpass, allowing some passengers to accumulate tens of millions of miles as well as taxes and airport fees paid for by the airline. The program has been called \\"a huge disaster\\" for the company. The two AAirpass holders including their companion passes were terminated from the program when the airline accused them of fraudulent activity. Pass terminations Steve Rothstein, a financier then from Chicago, upgraded to a lifetime AAirpass for $233,509.93 on October 1, 1987, after a discount of $16,490.07 for the value of mileage on a previous AAirpass. He added a $150,000 companion pass 2 years later. Rothstein negotiated additions to the contract, including a provision for his companion to fly on flights immediately before or after his flight. During the more than 10 years Rothstein owned the pass, he traveled more than 10 million miles, accumulated over 40 million frequent flier miles (all of which he gave away), made more than 500 trips to England alone and cost the airline more than $21 million according to them. On December 13, 2008, Rothstein checked in at Chicago O'Hare International Airport with a friend for a flight to Bosnia. A letter from the airline was hand-delivered to him at the airport informing him that the pass had been terminated due to fraudulent behavior, specifically his history of approaching passengers at the gate and offering them travel on his companion seat and for using the companion program to purchase an adjacent empty seat under a fake name to keep them vacant, which was often used for privacy or extra carry-on luggage. Rothstein sued American Airlines in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, arguing that \\"American waived its rights to enforce the contract by not cracking down on Rothstein sooner\\" according to District Court Judge Virginia Mary Kendall who denied Rothstein's motion in 2011. Litigation was delayed due to the airline's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. By the end of 2012, the two parties appear to have settled their case out of court, with Rothstein's appeal dismissed and the airline's counterclaims dismissed with prejudice. Jacques E. Vroom Jr., a Dallas-based marketing executive, paid $356,000 for his unlimited AAirpass and companion pass on December 28, 1989, traveling nearly 38 million miles. A letter was hand-delivered to Vroom by airline security personnel on July 30, 2008, during check-in at London Heathrow Airport informing him that his passes had been terminated for fraudulent activity. The airline sued Vroom in 2011, accusing him of selling his companion seat, a violation of the American Airlines 1994 Tariff Rule 744. Vroom countersued, arguing that the rule went into effect after purchase of the lifetime pass and accusing the airline of slander; ultimately Vroom's motion failed and his AAirpass was revoked.

All but a tiny tip at the south end of the lake, the crux of the \\"L\\", is in the Township of Greater Madawaska, Renfrew County. The major inflow, at Camel Chute at the northwest, is the Madawaska River. A second primary inflow is Mackie Creek at the south, controlled by a weir dam. The major outflow is also the Madawaska River, which flows directly into Black Donald Lake at the northeast. The Madawaska River then flows via the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River and thence to the Atlantic Ocean. Renfrew County Road 65 crosses the northwest arm of the lake over a long, low, concrete bridge. History Centennial Lake, and Black Donald Lake adjacent downstream, were created by the construction of the Mountain Chute Generating Station and dam and an associated embankment dam in 1965–1966. Black Donald Lake subsumed the previous White Fish Lake and drowned the former mining community of Black Donald Mines, whose graphite mine by then had been exhausted.

A previous fort near the site (Fort Reno) had been abandoned and burned after the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868.WyoHistory.org, A project of the Wyoming State Historical Society, Section on \\"Cantonment Reno\\" Cantonment Reno was re- established in late 1876, just upstream of the site of old Fort Reno. Cantonment Reno started as a temporary base of operations for General George Crooks' 1876 Big Horn Expedition,.Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office, National Register of Historic Places, Fort McKinney Crook's Expedition was part of the intensive campaign against the Sioux and Cheyenne in late 1876, following Custer's defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Construction The construction of the cantonment began on October 14, 1876, and work was completed on December 19, 1876. The total cost of materials (doors, windows, hardware and lumber) was $931.91. US Army troops did most of the work, but civilian employees received an additional $170.00 in wages. The structures included a storehouse, two storage cellars, barracks (19 huts), a hospital, a mess room and kitchen, nine officers huts, a shed, a corral, teamster's hut, a blacksmith's shop, and a bakery for a total of forty-two structures. A wooden bridge was built across the river in March and April 1877. One of the cantonment's surgeons left a description of the hospital: \\"The hospital at this station is one log hut, 14 x 16 feet, occupied as a ward and dispensary, having a dirt floor and covered with dirt. The height of the roof from the floor inside is 9 feet on one side and 10 feet on the other, giving one foot slope to it; this room has five small windows and one door, and is heated when necessary by one stove.\\" Fort McKinney 1 On November 25, 1876, part of Crook's command, under the leadership of Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie, attacked a village of Cheyenne (\\"Dull Knife's village\\") on the nearby Red Fork of the Powder River. The army surprised and scattered the Cheyennes driving men, women and children out of their village into subzero temperatures and snow on the open prairie. The battle is known as the Dull Knife Fight or the Battle of Bates Creek. Cantonment Reno provided logistic support for the attack, and rudimentary care for the army wounded from the battle. Lieutenant John A. McKinney was one of the 25 American soldiers killed in the Dull Knife Fight. In May 1877, elements of the Fifth Cavalry established a camp on Clear Creek, near present-day Buffalo, Wyoming. On June 16, 1877, the officer in charge of the camp named it \\"Camp McKinney\\", in honor of the officer who was killed in the Dull Knife Fight. However, since this was only a temporary camp, no one at headquarters recognized the name. However, this camp developed into Fort McKinney (Wyoming) also known as Fort McKinney 2, the fort near Buffalo. At about the same time, the commander of Cantonment Reno asked his superiors that his Cantonment be renamed \\"Cantonment or Camp McKinney.\\" This was because mail for Cantonment Reno was being mixed up with mail directed to Fort Reno (Oklahoma). On August 30, 1877, the War Department officially renamed Cantonment Reno as Fort McKinney. This duplication of names has led to endless confusion over the years between Fort McKinney 1 (Cantonment Reno) and Fort McKinney 2, Fort McKinney (Wyoming). Abandonment By 1878, Cantonment Reno was experiencing lumber, forage and water shortages. After considerable study a decision was made to relocate the post to the new Fort McKinney, 45 miles northwest, to a site on the Clear Fork of the Powder River. The new site of Fort McKinney was on benchlands just north of the Clear Fork, about two miles west of present-day Buffalo, Wyoming. By the end of 1878, the Army had vacated Cantonment Reno/Fort McKinney 1. Only a small detail of soldiers remained to take care of the depot and repair the telegraph line. Doors, window sashes, and hardware were stripped from the cantonment to supply the new post on Clear Fork, leaving the hulls of post buildings. On December 10, 1878 Major Verling K. Hart, commander at the new Fort McKinney, recommended that a section of land at the old post be retained as a campground, so the land at Cantonment Reno remains publicly owned. Powder River Crossing On May 13, 1879, the commander of Fort McKinney allowed a \\"Mr. Freron\\" to open a store and eating house (but not a bar) in the abandoned sutler's store at Cantonment Reno. \\"Mr. Freron\\" was Moreton Frewen, an English rancher in the Powder River country. The three-man caretaker detail at the cantonment was withdrawn in late 1879, and civilians took over the telegraph operation. In January 1880, the Rock River Stage Company received permission to move one of the log stables across the Powder River. This was the beginning of the settlement known as Powder River Crossing. Current Status The Cantonment Reno site is one square mile in size. Its boundary lines are the historic boundary lines of the McKinney Military Reservation, which coincides to some extent with Section 17, T44N, R78W. The site is located on County Road 76, five miles north of the intersection with Wyoming Highway 192, about twenty miles east of Kaycee, Wyoming. Today no structures remain of the cantonment, but shallow depressions in the ground are evidence of their former existence. Removal of structures and artifacts is a part of the history of Cantonment Reno. Scattered widely throughout the site are fragments of metal, wood and glass, reminders of what once could be found at the depot. An instance of wholesale removal of artifacts from this historic site occurred as late as 1962. The site is administered by the Bureau of Land Management.

The company sells a range of single origin chocolate bars and vanilla products, sourced from the island of Madagascar and introduced a new line of Uganda chocolate bars in early 2020.https://www.globenewswire.com/news- release/2020/01/16/1971713/0/en/Beyond-Good-Sweetens-its-Offering-with-Three- New-Chocolate-Bars.html All of the cocoa is certified Direct Trade and is sourced directly from Malagasy and Ugandan cocoa farmers. For several years, Beyond Good worked with a local chocolate producer based in Antananarivo, and is currently producing chocolate in its own facility in Madagascar as well as in Europe. History Founders Brett Beach and Tim McCollum met while serving as Peace Corps volunteers in Madagascar. After spending a combined eight years on the island, McCollum and Beach felt that they wanted to have more of an impact and that “business was needed for real (social and environmental) change.”Dugan, Owen \\"Made in Madagascar\\", Wine Spectator, Los Angeles, 31 May 2010. Cocoa had always been a major export of Madagascar but very little chocolate had been produced on the island, much like in the rest of Africa. Even though the continent grows over 65% of the world's cocoa, less than 1% of the world's chocolate is made there.Watkins, Tate \\"Cuckoo for Cocoa Processing: Making Chocolate—Not Just Picking It—Helps Madagascar Develop\\", Good Business 7 February 2012. The two were determined to have a significant impact on the island they had come to love, and formulated an innovative business model for a chocolate business. They would produce chocolate on the island, and the majority of the economic benefit would stay within the country.Follmer, Max \\"Madecasse Takes Bitter out of Chocolate Sweetness\\" , Take Part March 1, 2011 The two reunited back in the United States and started the company at Beach's residence in Lawrence, Kansas. Beyond Good partnered with the cocoa farmers of the Ezaka Cooperative, from a remote area of Madagascar.\\"Creating Change through Chocolate\\" PCC Natural Markets The company initially had trouble meeting the quality standards of the United States, as the cocoa beans needed more fermentation and drying. McCollum said, “You have farmers farming cocoa who have never eaten chocolate.” Beyond Good trained the farmers, invested in equipment, and developed a bonus program for the cooperative. Since the company established a consistent process for producing high quality cocoa, it has achieved critical acclaim for its chocolates. Beyond Good partnered with a factory on the island that has steadily increased their production outcome, according to Malagasy-born Michaël Chauveau, director of operations in Madagascar. As Beyond Good expanded, it ventured out and partnered with more farming cooperatives in order to meet demand. There was room for growth in other markets besides chocolate, as Madagascar provided 60% of the world's vanilla beans.\\"Fair Trade Vanilla: Anything but Plain\\" Good Business 31 May 2011 Beyond Good exports vanilla beans and extract from Madagascar to replicate the effect that they have with their chocolate bars in the vanilla sector. Now, Beyond Good has offices in Brooklyn, managed by McCollum, and Madagascar.

Fascinated by mathematics, biology and crystals, Smith designed Tau with geometry at its root. Description American artist Tony Smith created Tau (1/3) in 1961–62.\\"Tony Smith: Architect, Painter, Sculptor\\" Robert Storr, p162(The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1998) Its title refers to the Greek letter 'T', which also describes the shape of the sculpture.\\"Tony Smith\\" NJN State of the Arts www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCg3_p46QaA Intended as one of three limited editions, its sister, Tau (AP), was fabricated at Lippincott Foundry, and installed in 2006 at Meadowlands Park, in his hometown of South Orange. Many of Smith's sculptures were made up of a space lattice: groupings of simple platonic solids, in Tau's case two such solids, octahedrons and tetrahedrons. The original model for the sculpture was created by Smith in 1961-62 using his signature process of joining small cardboard tetrahedrons, a process he began while recuperating after a severe automobile accident in the spring of 1961.\\"Tony Smith: Architect, Painter, Sculptor\\" Robert Storr, p185 (The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1998) During this period, Smith was transitioning from his 20-year career in architecture to focus on painting and making sculptures. Smith had also started teaching at Hunter College, New York, in 1962. It took over 20 years for the piece to be installed outside the upper east side college at the 6 train's 68th Street entrance in 1984. In 2004, Hunter College held an exhibition, \\"Tracing Tau\\", curated by William C. Agee that offered an insight into the sculpture and its beginnings through paper models, drawings and plans of the work.http://www.johntoth.net/Hunter/Activities/TauActivity.htm Historical information Tau forms part of Smith's series of cast bronze and painted steel sculptures including Amaryllis (1965) and The Snake Is Out (1962), all evolution of his first titled sculpture, Throne (1956–57).\\"Tony Smith: Architect, Painter, Sculptor\\" Robert Storr, p30(The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1998) Though Tau is one of Smith's less publicized works, it is part of a body of work inspired by his oft-cited, revelatory road trip to the unfinished New Jersey Turnpike in the early 1950s. \\"When I was teaching at Cooper Union in the first year or two of the '50s, someone told me how I could get on to the unfinished New Jersey Turnpike. I took three students and drove from somewhere in the Meadows to New Brunswick. It was a dark night and there were no lights or shoulder markers, lines, railings or anything at all except the dark pavement moving through the landscape of the flats, rimmed by hills in the distance, but punctuated by stacks, towers, fumes and colored lights. This drive was a revealing experience. The road and much of the landscape was artificial, and yet it couldn't be called a work of art. On the other hand, it did something for me that art had never done. At first I didn't know what it was, but its effect was to liberate me from many of the views I had had about art. It seemed that there had been a reality there which had not had any expression in art.\\" \\"The experience on the road was something mapped out but not socially recognized. I thought to myself, it ought to be clear that's the end of art. Most paintings look pretty pictorial after that. There is no way you can frame it, you just have to experience it. Later I discovered some abandoned airstrips in Europe -- abandoned works, Surrealist landscapes, something that had nothing to do with any function, created worlds without tradition. Artificial landscape without cultural precedent began to dawn on me. This is a drill ground in Nuremberg, large enough to accommodate two million men. The entire field is enclosed with high embankments and towers. The concrete approach is three 16-inch steps, one above the other, stretching for a mile or so.\\"\\"Talking with Tony\\" Interview with Tony Smith by Samuel J.

SLED provides manpower and technical assistance to other law enforcement agencies and conducts investigations on behalf of the state as directed by the Governor and Attorney General. SLED Headquarters is located in the state capital, Columbia, with offices in the Midlands, Piedmont, Pee Dee, and Low Country regions. History The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division was created in 1935 by Act 232 of the South Carolina General Assembly \\"for the purpose of enforcing the state liquor law [...] and to assist any law enforcement officer in the detection of crime and the enforcement of any criminal laws of the state of South Carolina.\\"South Carolina Legislative Manual, 1944. SLED replaced the old state constabulary which had been created in 1893 and then disbanded in 1932 due to the financial constraints of the Great Depression.The State Newspaper, February 22, 1932. The 1935 law provided $70,000.00 to fund the new organization. Governor Olin D. Johnston appointed J. Henry Jeanes, a veteran law enforcement officer and Chief of the Pelzer Police Department, as the first Chief of SLED. He in turn hired twenty-one constables from around the state.Florence Morning News, May 23, 1935. Although SLED initially focused on enforcement of the liquor laws, within a short period of time the Division was also investigating cases of all sorts, including murder, lynching, and labor violence. In 1947 the State Identification Bureau, a unit of the South Carolina Highway Patrol, was transferred to SLED by a Concurrent Resolution of the General Assembly. The head of the I. D. Bureau, Lt. Joel Townsend, was appointed Chief of SLED. In 1961, under the administration of Governor Ernest F. Hollings, Chief J. P. Strom appointed the first female SLED Agents, Ebby B. Long and Gladys A. Toney. That same year he also appointed the first African- American Agents, Joseph Wong and Cambridge Jenkins, Jr. In 1974, Act 1240 of the General Assembly formally established SLED as an independent state agency. Mission SLED has exclusive jurisdiction over a wide variety of law enforcement functions in South Carolina, including the operation of a statewide criminal justice information system, coordination of counter- terrorism efforts, and the investigation of arson and explosive devices. SLED is also responsible for investigating child fatalities, crimes against vulnerable adults, and the interdiction of narcotics. The agency operates the state’s forensics laboratory and maintains specialized tactical response units. In addition, SLED regulates the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in the state. It also licenses security guards, private investigators and polygraph examiners. SLED also oversees Governor appointed and Commissioned State Constables. Organization SLED is made up of civilian employees and law enforcement officers that have many different specialties and areas of expertise. The major bureaus within SLED include Criminal Justice Information Services, Investigative Services, Forensic Services, Counter-terrorism/Tactical Services, and Regulatory Services. SLED's Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) is the hub of law enforcement information for the state. Databases of fingerprints, criminal records, sex offenders and investigative matters are linked to other states through connections with the FBI's National Crime Information Center. SLED CJIS publishes Crime in South Carolina on an annual basis in order to provide crime statistics to the public and policy makers. SLED CJIS also assists citizens who need background checks conducted for employment, adoption, and other reasons. The history of CJIS dates back to the 1930s, when the South Carolina Highway Patrol established the first state level Identification Bureau under the leadership of Wallace Leo Jenkins. Agents assigned to Investigative Services work cases involving all types of offenses, including crimes of violence, computer crimes, vehicle theft, child fatalities, and crimes against vulnerable adults. SLED Agents also investigate officer-involved shootings, public corruption, insurance fraud, as well as narcotics and alcoholic beverage violations. SLED's Forensic Laboratory processes and analyzes physical evidence in support of criminal investigations. Units within the lab specialize in DNA, toxicology, drug identification, latent fingerprints, questioned documents, firearms, and trace evidence. Agents assigned to the lab process crime scenes throughout the state to document and collect evidence. Counterterrorism and Tactical Services includes units that specialize in explosive devices, arson, and Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT). SLED also maintains a kennel of tracking bloodhounds, helicopters, and a fleet of specialized response vehicles. Regulatory Services serves as a licensing bureau for security guards, private investigators, and citizens with concealed weapons permits. The Alcohol Licensing Unit works in conjunction with the S.C. Department of Revenue Alcohol Beverage Licensing Department in the processing of certain types of alcohol license applications for the state of South Carolina. SLED Regulatory also oversees Governor appointed State Constables per SC Statute 23-1-60 for training, policies and procedures and receives quarterly reports of their actions taken as law enforcement officers.

(1752January 15, 1815) was an English Catholic priest and Jesuit missionary to the United States who became the first president of Georgetown College. Born in England, he was educated at the Colleges of St Omer and Bruges, as well as at the English College at Douai. There, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1769, but left four years later, just before learning of the papal order suppressing the Society. Therefore, he was ordained a secular priest at the English College, and became the chaplain to a monastery of English Benedictine nuns in exile in Brussels. Plunkett petitioned to be sent to the United States as a missionary in 1789. Shortly after his arrival in 1790, Bishop John Carroll persuaded him to become the president of the newly established Georgetown College. Plunkett oversaw construction of the college's first building, the appointment of the first professor, and admission of the first student, William Gaston. However, he was more interested in pastoral work than education, and resigned the office two years later. Plunkett spent the remainder of his life ministering in rural Maryland, though continued to remain involved in the college's affairs.  Early life  Robert Plunkett was born in 1752, in England. He was educated at the Colleges of St Omer and Bruges from 1763 to 1768, before attending the English College at Douai. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1769, but left the order on August 21, 1773, after the promulgation of a papal brief suppressing the Jesuits worldwide, but before news of this brief reached him in the Low Countries. Therefore, he continued his studies at Douai as a secular seminarian, and was ordained a priest there. After his ordination, Plunkett became the chaplain to the Monastery of Our Lady of the Assumption in Brussels, in the Austrian Netherlands, which housed a community of Benedictine nuns who had been exiled from England. Chapel of the Jesuit college in alt=Facade of the Jesuit college's chapel On April 20, 1789, Plunkett formally requested permission from the Vicar Apostolic of the London District to go to the United States as a missionary. As a result of the Jesuits' fourth vow concerning missionary work, the permission of the Holy See was required as well, and Plunkett's request was forwarded to the Sacred Congregation de Propaganda Fide. The prefect of the congregation, Cardinal Leonardo Antonelli, approved the request and informed John Carroll, the Prefect Apostolic of the United States, who had been recruiting Jesuits in Europe to run the newly established Georgetown College in Maryland. On May 1, 1790, Plunkett set sail for America from Texel, aboard a ship called The Brothers, along with Charles Neale, a group of four Discalced Carmelite sisters from Hoogstraten who were going to found a convent in the United States. The cost of his voyage, £50 (), was defrayed by the Corporation of Roman Catholic Clergymen of Maryland. The journey was prolonged because the captain had taken aboard goods to be delivered to Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Plunkett frequently went ashore while the ship was in port in Santa Cruz. He laid to rest the concerns of the local ecclesiastical authorities, who learned of a rumor that the Carmelite sisters were nuns fleeing their monastery with the aid of the two priests. The vessel arrived in New York City on July 2, 1790. Plunkett then departed Neale and the Carmelites and continued his journey to Maryland by land. His first assignment was at the Jesuit plantation in White Marsh, Maryland.  Georgetown College  Old North (right) and Old South (left) at Georgetown Collegealt=Georgetown University campus Though Bishop Carroll was aware Plunkett had traveled to the United States seeking of pastoral, rather than educational work, he persuaded the reluctant Plunkett to become the first president of Georgetown College. Carroll concluded that the few other former Jesuits in the United States either could not be removed from important ministries or were not suited to teaching. He had initially sought to name a distinguished English ex-Jesuit as the head of the college, such as Charles Plowden or Robert Molyneux, but they were unwilling to assume the position. Construction of the college was nearly completed in late 1791. A French Sulpician seminarian, Jean-Edouard de Mondésir, became the first professor at the college in October of that year, while still learning English from Plunkett. As funds for the school were meager, Carroll preferred seminarians or Jesuit scholastics over full-time professors, as he was able to pay them only 75 Maryland pounds plus room and board, substantially below the average £150-200 salary for professors in the country. The first student, William Gaston, arrived at Georgetown from New Bern, North Carolina in early 1791, to find the college not yet open. He returned again in November, and lived at the City Tavern, as the college building was not complete. Eventually, Gaston began classes on January 2, 1792, along with Charles Philemon Wederstrandt, from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. During Plunkett's term, the number of students rose steadily, totaling 40 by July 1792, and hailing from as far away as New York City and the West Indies. As a result of Carroll's letters to Catholic families across the country, Georgetown had a significantly more geographically diverse student body than other American colleges at the time. To accommodate this increase, the college building was extended by and a third story was added. Plunkett oversaw the division of the school into three parts: elementary, preparatory, and college. Plunkett increasingly preferred the plantation life of the former Jesuits in rural Maryland, and became dissatisfied with administering the college. In December 1792, he submitted his resignation to Carroll, but agreed to remain until a replacement could be found. In June 1793, Carroll named Molyneux to succeed Plunkett as president.  Later missionary years  Following the end of his tenure at Georgetown, Plunkett took up missionary work. Though living in Georgetown, he traveled regularly on horseback throughout Montgomery County, Maryland, where he was given charge of the congregations in Rock Creek, Rockville, Seneca, Barnesville, and Holland's River. He was later stationed in Prince George's County, Maryland, including for a time as pastor of the church in Bladensburg. He was also in charge of Queen's Chapel, a Catholic chapel built on the Queen family estate in Prince George's County. Despite his preference for rural ministry, Plunkett continued to remain involved in Georgetown College's affairs. When the school was at a deficit of funds for the completion of the Old North Building in 1797, Plunkett donated a sum to aid its opening. He was also named as one of five original members of Georgetown's board of directors, upon its creation in 1797; he would remain a director until 1808. These directors took measures to reduce the influence of the Sulpicians at the college, one of whom, Louis William Valentine Dubourg, became president of the school. Plunkett died on January 15, 1815, at Notley Hall in St. Mary's County, Maryland, near the settlement of Chaptico. He was interred in the crypt of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery.

To operate the facility and to provide training and operational evaluation in the missile program, ADC established the 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) (4751st ADW) on 15 January 1958. The first launch from Santa Rosa took place on 15 January 1959.Gibson, James N. Nuclear Weapons of the United States: An Illustrated History . Atglen, Pennsylvania: Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 1996. . The training program used technicians acting as instructors and was established for a four-month duration. Training included missile maintenance; SAGE operations and launch procedures, including the launch of an unarmed missile at Eglin. The last Bomarc missile squadron inactivated on 31 October 1972.

Robson was a left-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He was born at Perkinsville, County Durham. Robson qualified to play for Northumberland through his residence in the county, making his debut for it against Durham in the 1932 Minor Counties Championship. Before World War II, Robson made 65 appearances for the county in the Minor Counties Championship. Playing minor counties cricket for Northumberland allowed Robson to be selected to play for a representative Minor Counties cricket team, making a single first-class appearance for the team against the touring West Indians at Lord's in 1939. The West Indians won the toss and elected to bat first, making 370 all out, with Robson taking the wickets of Vic Stollmeyer, Jeff Stollmeyer, Gerry Gomez and Foffie Williams, to finish with figures of 4/80 from sixteen overs, which were also the best bowling figures in the innings. The Minor Counties then made 306 all out in their first-innings, with Robson the last man out when he was dismissed for 3 runs by Rolph Grant. The West Indians then reached 138/4 in their second-innings, in which Robson bowled nine wicketless overs for the cost of 44 runs, with the match declared a draw at this point. After World War II, Robson returned to playing minor counties cricket for Northumberland, making an additional 24 appearances in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against the Yorkshire Second XI in 1949. Described by Wisden as \\"one of the best spin bowlers ever produced by the North East of England\\", he took over 300 wickets for Northumberland, with his most successful season coming in 1939 when he took 48 wickets at an average of 19.31. He also played cricket in the Lancashire League for Haslingden. Outside of cricket, he worked as a plumber. He died at Chester-le- Street, County Durham, on 31 August 1968.

Though he occasionally works in other mediums, he is best known for his wooden sculptures which explore various dimensions of Arawak Amerindian culture and tradition. Hussein first achieved national recognition when he won first prize in Guyana's National Exhibition of the Visual Arts in 1989, and since that time he has gone on to become one of Guyana's most celebrated artists and a leading figure in Guyanese sculpture. Along with his half-brother, George Simon, he is one of the most prominent members of the Lokono Artists Group. His work has been displayed in numerous exhibitions in Guyana, Barbados, and the United Kingdom. Life Oswald Hussein was born in St. Cuthbert's Mission (Arawak: Pakuri) in British Guiana (now Guyana) in 1954. Hussein first started working in wood carving and sculpture in the 1960s. In 1988, he joined an art and design workshop in St. Cuthbert's that was founded and led by his half- brother George Simon when the latter returned to Guyana after studying art in the UK. The workshop in St. Cuthbert's enabled a number of local artists, including Hussein, to develop their skills; and as the national reputation of these artists grew, they came to be known as the Lokono Artists' group. Hussein's involvement in the Lokono Artists Group and the St. Cuthbert's workshop marked the beginning of his rise to national, and later international success. In 1989 he won first prize in Guyana's National Exhibition of the Visual Arts with his sculpture Massasekeree; and in 1993 he repeated this achievement when he won first prize again for this sculpture Wepelly. In 1991, Hussein's work was displayed at the Hadfield foundation as part of an exhibition called Contemporary Amerindian Art, which showcased the work of nine members of the Lokono Artists Group. After another group exhibition in 1998 entitled Six Lokono Artists, the Venezuelan Cultural Centre in Georgetown hosted the first solo exhibition of Hussein's work in 1999, entitled Sunset Birds. This was closely followed by Sunset Birds II - an exhibition dedicated to Hussein and fellow Lokono artist Roaland Taylor, at the National Art Gallery in Castellani House in 2000. In 2006, Hussein was offered the position of artist-in-residence at the Horniman Museum in London. The residency was initially planned to begin in August of that year, but Hussein had to delay his journey after he was badly injured in a motorbike accident shortly before he was due to leave the UK. During his residency at the Horniman Museum, Hussein took part in an art exhibition called Amazon to Caribbean: Early Peoples of the Rainforest, which was curated by Hassan Arero. Art As a sculptor, Hussein's artistic method and style have varied and developed over the years. His sculptures always begin from a section of tree-trunk, and can take anything from one day to four months to complete. Critics have remarked upon substantial stylistic differences between his early and later works. While his early sculptures are predominantly large-scale pieces that are balanced between horizontal and vertical planes, his later works are noticeably smaller and most often vertically oriented. Conceptually, Hussein draws inspiration from his native Arawak cultural traditions. In an interview from 2006, he explained that a number of his sculptures were based upon stories that his mother told him when he was young, about \\"animals, humming birds or fish [...] and the sun and rain gods which mark events in our lives\\". =Notable works= Oriyu Banka (1995) Oriyu Banka is a wooden sculpture that was created by Hussein in 1995. The sculpture is made of saman wood, and measures approximately 70 by 25.5 centimetres. It is a long, rounded sculpture that is covered with bold, geometric patterns, the most prominent of which are the circular, eye-like designs in the centre of the piece and the 12 sharp, curved \\"teeth\\" that protrude from its sides. The Arawakan title of the work translates as \\"Bench of the Water Spirit\\", with \\"Oriyu\\" being the name of a well-known female water-spirit in Arawak and other Amerindian mythologies. Critics Anne Walmsley and Stanley Greaves note that while the sculpture's shape and title are suggestive of a traditional bench, its sharp teeth and caiman-like appearance \\"would defy any human to sit on it\\".

In a racing career which lasted from April to August 2005 the filly ran five times and won three races. Unraced as a two-year-old, Eswarah won her first three races as a three-year- old culminating with a win in the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom. In her two subsequent appearances she finished eighth in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and fourth in the Yorkshire Oaks. Background Eswarah is a bay mare with a white star and a white sock on her left hind leg, bred by her owner Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Estate. Her sire, Unfuwain was a high-class middle-distance runner who won four Group races before siring the winners of more than five hundred winners at stud. He was particularly successful with fillies: his daughters included Lahan (1,000 Guineas Stakes), Petrushka (Irish Oaks, Yorkshire Oaks, Prix de l'Opéra), Lailani (Irish Oaks, Nassau Stakes, Flower Bowl Invitational Handicap), Zahrat Dubai (Nassau Stakes) and Bolas (Irish Oaks). Eswarah's dam Midway Lady was a successful racemare, winning the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks in 1986 before producing several winners at stud. Eswarah was originally sent to be trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by Ben Hanbury, who had trained Midway Lady, but when Hanbury retired at the end of 2004, the filly, who had yet to race, was moved to the stables of Michael Jarvis. Eswarah, whose name is Arabic for \\"bracelet\\" was ridden in all of her races by Richard Hills. Racing career Eswarah made her first appearance in a ten furlong maiden race at Newbury in April 2005. Starting the 5/2 favourite against fifteen other fillies, Eswarah took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by two and a half lengths from Alumni. Four weeks later, Eswarah was moved up to Listed class for the Fillies' Trial Stakes over the same course and distance. Starting at odds of 1/2, Eswarah went clear of the field in the straight and won very easily by two lengths. On 3 June Eswarah started 11/4 joint favourite for the Oaks at Epsom, level in the betting with the 1000 Guineas winner Virginia Waters, despite being the least experienced and \\"about the smallest\\". Richard Hills settled the filly on the outside of the field of twelve runners and turned into the straight in fifth place. Hills explained that he kept the inexperienced filly well away from the inside rail to avoid and bumping or interference. Eswarah moved into the lead two furlongs from the finish and was driven out by Hills to win by one and a half lengths from the David Elsworth- trained Something Exciting. There was a gap of three lengths to Pictavia, who beat Virginia Waters by a length for third. The win was a second classic of Michael Jarvis's long career following Ameerat's success in the 2001 1000 Guineas. After the race he described Eswarah as an exceptional filly and named the Irish Oaks and the Yorkshire Oaks as likely future targets. Eswarah was then given a break of seven weeks before returning in Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Her connections cited the filly's improving form and the generous weight-for-age concessions she would receive from her opponents as the main reasons for decision to run. As Ascot Racecourse was being redeveloped, the 2005 King George was run at Newbury Racecourse and Eswarah was the only three-year-old in the twelve runner field starting at odds of 9/1. After looking to be going well early in the straight, Eswarah weakened in the closing stages and finished eighth behind Azamour, beaten eighteen lengths. In the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse in August, Eswarah led briefly a furlong from the finish but faded into fourth place behind the four-year-old Punctilious. After this disappointing performance x-ray examinations revealed a bone chip in the filly's knee and her retirement from racing was announced in September. Jarvis commented that despite Eswarah's win in the Oaks, which he described as \\"the highlight of my career\\", the filly had never been suited by the firm ground which had prevailed that summer. Assessment and honours In the 2005 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Eswarah was given a rating of 115, making her the equal sixth best three-year-old filly in the world seven pounds below Divine Proportions. The filly received an unusual honour when property developers named a new housing estate in Epsom Eswarah House. Stud record Eswarah was retired to become a broodmare for the Shadwell Stud.

These laws are supported by the National Domestic Workers Alliance, a labor advocacy group founded in 2007. The first such law took effect in New York state on November 29, 2010. Among other rights, this law gave domestic workers the right to overtime pay, a day of rest every seven days, three paid days of rest each year (after one year of work for the same employer), protection under the state human rights law, and a special cause of action for domestic workers who suffer sexual or racial harassment. In July 2013, Hawaii became the second state to implement basic labor protections for domestic workers. In January 2014, similar legislation took effect in California; by 2019, nine states had enacted legislation granting labor rights to domestic workers.  Background  In the United States, it is estimated that over two million women can be considered a domestic worker. Domestic Workers fulfill various roles from nannies, housekeepers, and caregivers. Domestic Workers may work as a caregiver of a person, place, or thing outside the home performing domesticated responsibilities. Domestic Workers can also work in environments outside of a personal residential home such as a nursing home, childcare center or home, as an employee of a caregiving agency, or as an independent direct-pay employee.Kim, E Tammy and Poo, Ai-jen (March–April 2011). \\"Organizing to Transform Ourselves and Our Laws: The New York Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Campaign\\" (PDF). Journal of Poverty Law and Policy. 44: 11–12. Most of domestic workers are foreign born and the primary income earners in their families. Of these foreign born, most are women of color. In the 20th century, domestic workers were majority African Americans, whose exploitation was deliberate as the history of them was related to slavery in the United States. The result was that Southern members of Congress, states where slavery was an valuable asset, prevented domestic workers to be included under federal labor laws during the New Deal era. No protections or laws for workplace standards covered domestic workers. Privately employed domestic workers are the most isolated and exploited members of the workforce. Domestic workers frequently face issues such as long work hours for low pay, sudden terminations, no specific sick or personal or vacations days, and physical or verbal abuse. Even if domestic workers seek support when their rights are violated, there were none available as they are not covered under civil rights laws, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). The structure of the domestic labor industry contributed to the difficulty of formally establishing legal rights, as it is difficult to organize domestic workers and enforce a labor standard that will be followed by all employers. Workplaces are private homes that vary in the treatment of workers.  Statewide initiatives  =New York= A Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights campaign started in 2003. It was pushed by the Domestic Workers United (DWU) and the NY Domestic Workers Justice Coalition. After a six-year grassroots campaign, the Governor of New York signed the Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights. Under the New York Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights, a domestic worker is defined as someone who works in another person's home who is not related to them and is not a part-time job. This bill gives domestic workers an eight-hour work day and overtime (time and a half) for working over 40 hours a week (or 44 hours if the employee resides in the home of their employer). This law also establishes that workers must be granted one day (24 hours) off every seven days of work or be paid overtime pay if the employee agrees to work on this day. Also, after one year of work with the same employer, domestic workers are granted three paid days off every year. Although domestic workers were already covered by the minimum wage law, this bill ensures that domestic workers receive $7.25 per hour. Employers must pay their workers weekly and cannot deduct money from the employee's paycheck without written permission. Employers must now keep a payroll and provide workers with written notifications regarding sick days, vacation days, and work schedules. Domestic workers who work at least 40 hours a week are now entitled to Workers' Compensation Insurance and Disability Benefits. This law also gives domestic workers coverage under the New York State Human Rights Law if they have been harassed due to gender, race, sex, religion, or origin. The employer cannot make any unwanted sexual advances including both physical and verbal sexual actions. If the worker files a complaint, the employer cannot retaliate. This law covers all full-time workers, including immigrants. This law does not cover people who are related to the person they care for, or if they are a part-time worker, such as a baby-sitter. =Hawaii= Hawaii governor Neil Abercrombie signed a domestic workers bill of rights in July 2013, making Hawaii the second U.S. state to give nannies, housekeepers and others protections on wages and other labor issues.https://www.wsj.com/articles/AP6c537efafd864377bd2c59b966de8969 The domestic workers bill in Hawaii makes it illegal to discriminate against domestic workers based on several factors, including race, gender and sexual orientation. It also establishes protections, overtime, rest breaks, and protection from abuse and harassment for them. It covers cooks, waiters, butlers and others, including some baby sitters; it went into effect immediately. =California= California had a years-long debate about passing a Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. A 2012 California bill, which was inspired by the New York Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, would have entitled domestic workers to overtime pay, eased eligibility requirements for workers' compensation, and provided them with meal and rest breaks, the right to eight hours of sleep, and the right to use their employers’ kitchens to cook their own food. That bill passed the state Senate and the concurrence vote in the Assembly, but California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed it on September 30, 2012.Michelle Chen, \\"Workers and Activists Look Ahead after Gov. Brown Vetoes Pro-Immigrant Bills\\" , In These Times, October 3, 2012. However, the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights (AB 241) was signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown on September 26, 2013, and went into effect on January 1, 2014. The law makes nannies, private healthcare aides and other domestic workers in California eligible for overtime pay if they work more than nine hours a day or 45 hours a week. = Washington = The city of Seattle is the first to add a minimum wage, set break times, and political representation to all domestic workers. It was unanimously passed July 23, 2018 and will be enforced starting July 1, 2019. The legislation classifies domestic workers as independent contractors, whose pay must be the equivalent to minimum wage, and prohibits employers from keeping workers' personal documents like passports. Future regulations will be made by a newly established 13-member board.

It was responsible for the air defense of the United States, and was last stationed at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. It was last assigned to Tactical Air Command, and was inactivated on 6 December 1985. ADTAC was established when the Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) was inactivated as a Major Command on 1 October 1979. Aerospace Defense Command's atmospheric defense resources (interceptors, warning radars, and associated bases and personnel) were subsequently transferred to ADTAC. The command was, essentially, a transition organization between the Aerospace Defense Command, and the transfer of the air defense mission from the USAF to the Air National Guard in 1990. It consisted of over 25,000 military and civilian personnel performing duty at radar sites, missile warning stations, fighter interceptor bases, satellite tracking centers, and command and control centers throughout the world.Major Maurice C. Eldredge (1985), A Brief history of ADTAC, the first five years. The command had the responsibility to provide operationally ready interceptor aircraft and aircrews for air defense alert 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. These assets had to be capable of scrambling to identify and assist or engage unidentified or hostile airborne objects approaching or entering United States airspace without proper approval. These scrambles were initiated from the respective region headquarters based on information derived from radar site data and previously known or expected airborne traffic. During increased states of readiness, these same ADTAC assets would provide additional air defense forces to CINCNORAD to provide early warning information, attack assessment, and air defense of North America. During peacetime operations, the mission of ADTAC was to command, train, manage, and evaluate forces required for the above-mentioned air defense contingencies. In doing so, the tasks of preparing budget proposals, acquiring equipment, and providing support requirements, were essential to providing ready air defense forces. Components * Subordinate to the ADTAC headquarters element were six air defense air divisions (20th, 21st, 23d, 24th, 25th and 26th), Air Forces Iceland, the Distant Early Warning Line, and the Air Defense Weapons Center The six air division commanders also functioned as the NORAD region commanders for their particular regions during wartime operations. Each air division had responsibility for a specific area of the country. * Each air division was commanded from a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) blockhouse, which housed the division's command and control center, plus associated air defense radar and computer hardware. There were 80 Long Range Radars (LRRs) and 21 radar squadrons in the SAGE radar site system. * Subordinate to each air division were assigned fighter interceptor squadrons. The fighter units allocated to ADTAC consisted of seven Air Force and 10 Air National Guard units. The Air Force fighter squadrons were equipped with F-4 Phantom II and F-106 Delta Dart aircraft. The Air National Guard units had the F-101 Voodoo, F-4 Phantom II, and the F-106 Delta Dart. * The Distant Early Warning Line provided early warning of attack from a system of 31 radar sites stretching from Alaska to Greenland. * The Air Defense Weapons Center was the primary location for training air defense forces. F-106 and T-33 pilot and instructor pilot training, as well as weapons controller training, was conducted here. Tactics research and development and weapons system evaluation were important aspects of the Weapons Center's mission. * ADTAC also acquired two Martin EB-57 Canberra electronic faker aircraft units, one Air Force and one Air National Guard, each with the mission of providing electronic countermeasure training. By flying simulated target missions to test radar sites, command and control facilities, as well as interceptor aircrew performance, these units provided additional valuable training for strategic air defense forces. Realignments HQ ADTAC remained at Peterson AFB, Colorado to direct the transition into TAC, which was eventually moved to Langley AFB in July 1981. In essence, Tactical Air Command became the old Continental Air Command (ConAC), of which, TAC and Air Defense Command were part of during the postwar years. In 1979 there were fewer than 100 long-range aircraft detection radars covering the United States, Alaska, Canada, and Iceland, The old SAGE (Semi Automatic Ground Environment) System with its 1950 vintage computers and radar sites, was being replaced by the JSS (Joint Surveillance System) in 1983 using modern technology computer technology and joint-use (Federal Aviation Agency and Air Force) radar sites. The Joint Surveillance System would consist of radars, Regional Operations Control Centers (ROCCs), and communications and support facilities. The ROCCs would be phased in to replace the SAGE blockhouses as command and control centers. The old SAGE system was designed for both peacetime and wartime functions. The JSS/ROCC system was designed primarily for peacetime, or until the tactical situation required transfer of control to an E-3A Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) designated for air defense. The six continental U.S. SAGE centers were to be replaced by four ROCCs. Two additional ROCCs were planned, one by the Canadians for the defense of Canada, and one for Alaska. The 552d Airborne Warning and Control Wing, located at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, was part of Tactical Air Command and supplied E-3A AWACS aircraft for strategic air defense purposes. Interceptor aircraft transferred to ADTAC during the reorganization consisted of F-101 Voodoo, F-106 Delta Dart, and F-4 Phantom II fighters. The F-101 was the oldest and was possessed by three Air National Guard units, plus the Air Defense Weapons Center at Tyndall AFB. The F-101s at Tyndall were used mainly as simulated target aircraft employing electronic counter measures (ECM) and for towing targets for testing and training. Due to its age and problems in supporting the F-101, it was soon deleted from the inventory. By the fall of 1982, all F-101s, including those at Tyndall, had been retired; and, except for those at Tyndall, had been replaced by the F-4 Phantom II. The F-4 and F-106 remained in the interceptor inventory. The F-4 was possessed by Air National Guard squadrons and the 57th Fighter Interceptor Squadron in Iceland. The F-106 was possessed by Air Force and Air Guard squadrons. Modification of the F-106 through the years had improved its fire control system in an attempt to keep it up-to-date, but did not update its armament except for the addition of a gun. TAC planned the eventual conversion of all the Air Force F-106 squadrons to the F-15 Eagle and F-4 units to the F-16 Fighting Falcon Air Defense Fighter (ADF) variant. The two squadrons of EB-57 Canberra aircraft transferred to ADTAC were retired from the inventory by 1983. These aircraft were previously used for target training missions and electronic countermeasure training. Both active-duty and Air National Guard squadrons under state control were administratively assigned to TAC though their state ANG control for the air defense mission. On 9 December 1985 these ADTAC Air Division units were placed under the newly activated First Air Force at Langley AFB, VA, which later moved to Tyndall AFB, FL in 1991. This arrangement remained in effect until the last F-106 was retired by the 177th FIG of the New Jersey Air National Guard and all Regular Air Force and ANG F-101 and F-106 units had transitioned to either the F-4, the F-15 or the F-16. The Air Defense Weapons Center at Tyndall AFB, Florida was reorganized and a new organization was activated, the 325th Fighter Weapons Wing (FWW). The 325th FWW, through its subordinate units, conducted an extensive training program for air defense aircrews and weapons controllers; the USAF Interceptor Weapons School (IWS) trained instructors in all phases of interceptor weapons systems and employment. F-106 training was conducted by the 2d Fighter Interceptor Training Squadron (FITS). This unit was re-designated the 2d Fighter Weapons Squadron (FWS) on 1 February 1982. The 2nd FWS's mission continued to be F-106 training with plans to convert to the F-15 Eagle starting in the fall of 1983. All continental USAF sub-scale and full-scale drone aerial target operations were consolidated in the 82d Tactical Aerial Targets Squadron (TATS). The Weapons Center's drone facilities, proximity to the Gulf of Mexico air-to-air gunnery ranges, and experienced personnel, made it compatible with many of TAC's training programs. Transfer to Air National Guard  The 20th and 21st Air Divisions were inactivated on 1 March and 23 September 1983 and their assets merged into other Air Divisions. On 6 December 1985 First Air Force was re-activated by TAC and assumed the assets of ADTAC, which was inactivated. * Air Forces Iceland was transferred to First Air Force on 6 December 1985 Table of Organization  : see: Distant Early Warning Line for information on the DEW chain of early warning radar stations in Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Iceland. * Headquarters, Air Defense, Tactical Air Command : Langley AFB, Virginia * 20th Air Division/NORAD Region : Fort Lee AFS, Virginia :: Interceptor Squadrons: ::: 48th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (Inactivated 1991), Langley AFB, VA ::: 119th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, NJ ANG, Atlantic City, NJ ::: 159th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, FL ANG, Jacksonville, FL :: Radar Squadrons: ::: 660th Radar Squadron (Inactivated 1980), MacDill AFB, FL ::: 671st Radar Squadron (Inactivated 1980), NAS Key West, FL ::: 679th Radar Squadron (Inactivated 1981), NAS Jacksonville, FL ::: 701st Radar Squadron (Inactivated 1988), Fort Fisher AFS, NC ::: 770th Radar Squadron (Inactivated 1980), Fort George G.

Written as a criticism of America's allies, the song depicts the fall of Captain America as a symbol of the United States' dire circumstances at the time. The song features multiple solos on different instruments as well as a riff similar to \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash.\\" The song saw single release in the United States and in the Netherlands. In the U.S. it had 'Low Budget' on the B-side, while in the Netherlands the B-side was 'In a Space'. The song has since made appearances on compilations and live albums. Background Like many of the other tracks on \\"Low Budget\\", \\"Catch Me Now I'm Falling\\" addresses then-current events. In this case the song shows lead singer Ray Davies portraying America in its time of need, with the lyrics criticizing both the U.S. and its allies that refuse to help it. Author Nick Hasted describes it as sounding as if \\"it could be a distress call from the last embattled radio station in an occupied land.\\" Hasted also notes that it invoked memories of the United States' aid to Europe via the Marshall Plan to criticize countries that were not helping the country in its time of need. While another song on Low Budget invokes DC Comics hero Superman, \\"Catch Me Now I'm Falling\\" calls to Marvel Comics hero Captain America. The riff is similar to those on The Rolling Stones' \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash.\\" The song includes a saxophone solo that Billboard Magazine described as \\"hot,\\" as well as a guitar solo by Dave Davies. Release and reception The song was one of two U.S. only singles taken from Low Budget (the other being \\"A Gallon of Gas\\") to be released. Despite being an FM radio hit, the song failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. It also appeared on the compilation album Come Dancing with The Kinks and in live form on the album One for the Road. Hasted praises \\"Catch Me Now I'm Falling\\" for perfectly summing up the mood in the United States at the time \\"with a brilliant broad stroke.\\" Music producer Clive Davis described the song as tapping \\"the malaise at the tail end of the decade.\\" Music critic Johnny Rogan described the song as being \\"perfect\\" for live stadium shows. Billboard Magazine described the song as \\"sweeping\\" and \\"destined to become a favorite with fans\\" and rated it one of the top tracks from Low Budget. It also described the song as a \\"standout,\\" praising its \\"strong vocals and lyrics\\" and \\"neat saxophone work\\" while describing the guitar riff as being influenced by the Rolling Stones. Author Bob Cianci described it as an \\"FM radio hit.\\" But music critic Robert Christgau criticizes the song for lacking irony.

It is situated in the Toros Mountains at . It is away from Anamur. The population of Kılıç is only 50 as of 2011.  History  Kılıç corresponds to the ancient city of Binda in the Roman province of Pisidia. It was the seat of a bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Antioch of Pisidia, the capital of the province. The episcopal see is not mentioned in the Notitiae Episcopatuum of Pseudo-Epiphanius, which can be dated to 640, but appears in that attributed to Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Isaurian.Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte und ungenügend veröffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum, in: Abhandlungen der philosophisch-historische classe der bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1901, p. 556, nº 452. Three bishops of the see are known through their participation in church councils. Theodorus was at the Trullan Council of 692. At the Council of Constantinople (879) there were two bishops of Binda, Stephanus and Paulus, perhaps, as in other cases, one ordained by Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople, the other by Photius. No longer a residential bishopric, Binda is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 850 References Category:Villages in Anamur District ","title":"Kılıç, Anamur"},{"id":"36739700","text":"\\"'State of Confusion\\" is a song written by Ray Davies and first released by The Kinks as the title track of their 1983 album State of Confusion. Although it was not released as a single in the United States, it reached #26 on Billboards Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It was released as a single in Continental Europe. Lyrics and music The lyrics of \\"State of Confusion\\" depict numerous of sources of frustration to the singer. Among these are technological failures, such as a television that's \\"on the blink,\\" a clothes dryer that doesn't work and a video machine that breaks down. In addition, there are more domestic problems as the basement is flooded, the attic has woodworm and the ceiling has collapsed. To make matters worse, when the video machine breaks, the singer's girlfriend gets bored and leaves him. Later in the song, the singer is frustrated by trying to cross the street amidst traffic. The song ends with the singer unable to sleep due to financial worries and concluding that there is \\"no escape\\" from the world's \\"state of confusion.\\" If anything, things get worse as you age. Musically, the music opens with Dave Davies playing guitar chords, onto which Ian Gibbons layers on keyboard part which Ray Davies's biographer Thomas Kitts describes as \\"thin\\" and \\"haunting.\\" Dave Davies then starts playing the guitar riff, described by Kitts as \\"belligerent,\\" after which Ray Davies lets out a \\"tormented\\" scream, before beginning to sing the lyrics of the song. The song's guitar riff is an extension of the riffs played by Dave Davies back to the earliest Kinks' hits, \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"All Day and All of the Night.\\" One theme of the song is the way technology can overwhelm human emotion. Kitts suggests that the word \\"state\\" in the song and in the title represents multiple meanings - a psychic state of confusion, as well as the state as the government promoting consumer consumption, as well as the state of popular music which traps the singer, particularly in the video. Music critic Johnny Rogan finds the song a continuation of Davies' \\"misfit persona\\" from earlier songs. Recording \\"State of Confusion\\" was recorded at Konk Studios in Hornsey in March 1983, late in the recording process for the album. The song replaced the original intended title track of the album, \\"Entertainment.\\" Music video The Kinks shot a music video for MTV to support the song. The video depicts Ray Davies facing sources of frustration both at home and in the recording studio. Some of the sources of frustration in the video are different than those depicted in the song lyrics, such as difficulty using a computer and a razor at home, and difficulties with cue cards and a guitar strap in the studio. The video does not depict the girlfriend who moves out, but does show Davies struggling to cross the street. The video ends on a more triumphant note than the song lyrics: after Davies emerges from his dressing room for a performance, he leaps on stage with legs outstretched and the video ends with a freeze frame at the top of the leap. The energetic ending suggests transcending the earlier frustrations, perhaps as a result of the creative act of artistic performance. Critical reception Music critic Johnny Rogan considers \\"State of Confusion\\" a \\"fist-thrusting anthem,\\" finding the singer's mishaps and the chaos he faces \\"amusing.\\" Music critic Pete Bishop considers the song \\"solid rock with some dance beat.\\" Author Rob Jovanic claims that it \\"dashes along with the best pop-rockers of the era, such as \\"Footloose.\\" Other appearances After its initial release on State of Confusion, \\"State of Confusion\\" has appeared on a few Kinks compilation albums. It appeared on the 1996 US version of To the Bone, but not on the 1994 UK version.

The painting depicts three young ladies, from the Vickers family, in their estate in Bolsover Hill, Sheffield, England. Background The Misses Vickers, painted in 1884 by John Singer Sargent, is a portrait of three sisters, Florence Evelyn Vickers, Mabel Frances Vickers, and Clara Mildred Vickers. The portrait was commissioned by their father, Colonel Thomas Vickers, a wealthy industrialist.Ratcliff, \\"John Singer Sargent,\\" 89. Following its completion, The Misses Vickers was first exhibited at the Salon of 1885 alongside a portrait of Mrs. Albert Vickers, completed by Sargent in June 1884. Sargent later exhibited The Misses Vickers with Mrs. Albert Vickers and Portrait of Mrs. Robert Harrison at the Royal Academy in 1886.ibid Despite Colonel Vickers being pleased with the portrait, art critics at the Salon of 1885 overlooked it. The general opinion was less than enthusiastic, but one anonymous critic from The Spectator felt that the portrait was \\"in its way probably the cleverest thing in the exhibition. It is the ne plus ultra of French painting, or rather, of the French method as learned by a foreigner.\\"ibid Inspiration Sargent was an admirer of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, an art movement founded by Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1848. Rossetti's own portraits of women served as aesthetic inspiration to Sargent.Fairbrother, \\"John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist,\\" 153 It has been noted that grouping of the three sisters in The Misses Vickers is very similar to The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit, a portrait painted by Sargent in 1882. There are also formal similarities to Hearts Are Trumps, a group portrait of the Misses Armstrong painted by Sir John Everett Millais in 1872.ibid Execution and aftermath Sargent was commissioned to paint the Vickers sisters just before his 1884 exhibition of Portrait of Madame X, a painting which was met with controversy and negativity from critics and the general public, who felt that the painting was overly-sexual. Though Sargent left Paris soon after the negative critiques of his portrait of Madame Gautreau and feared that he would lose the business of those who had already commissioned him for portraits, Colonel Vickers did not withdraw his request. In July, Sargent travelled to the Vickers’ estate in Sheffield to begin the portrait.Fairbrother, 189 Following the competition of the portrait of his daughters, Colonel Vickers commissioned portraits of his wife and sons, and eventually Sargent was commissioned to paint the portraits of thirteen members of the extended Vickers family. In addition to being their portraitist, Sargent knew the Vickers family on a personal level, and became a regular guest at family dinners and parties.Fairbrother, 190 Following the wealthy, glamorous, and often-flashy clientele of Paris, Sargent viewed the commission from Colonel Vickers, a businessman and head of a well-respected family, as a regression from what his career had been. He described his subjects as \\"three ugly women\\" who \\"lived in a dingy hole\\",Fairbrother, 153 though the disdain he seems to have felt for his subjects is not readily apparent in the portrait itself. Sargent painted the sisters in fine day dresses with yards of material draping across their laps and spilling out of the sofa and chair they are seated upon. The presence of everyday objects, such as two cups of tea, a small pitcher of milk, and a piano, give the painting a casual tone. Although the scene is quiet, still, and contemplative, Sargent includes one detail of implied movement in the form of a book. The two sisters seated on the couch are flipping through a book, and though Sargent has painted all other elements in this scene with clarity, the pages of the book are blurred. Because of the objects within the scene and the positioning of the sisters, the scene manages to be both still and active at the same time, and the three Vickers sisters appear humble, despite their wealth.

It was also released on several compilation albums and as the B-side of the \\"Sweet Lady Genevieve\\" single. It is one of Davies' more introspective songs, musing about the cost of fame and stardom, and thus contributes to the album's theme of the difficulties of life on the road. Lyrics and music The theme of \\"Sitting in My Hotel\\" is the loneliness produced by stardom. According to Davies, the key line in the song is the oft-repeated line \\"if my friends could see me now.\\" Davies wonders in the song what his old friends would think of him and his life now that he is wealthy and famous. The lyrics suggest that now that he is wealthy and famous, he has lost some of his identity, particularly his link to his working-class roots. Davies comments on his outlandish stage costumes and performance style, referring to himself as an \\"outrageous poove,\\" and notes his attempts to avoid responsibility. He also questions whether his work is meaningful, from both a cultural and personal perspective. The cultural perspective is referred to in the line about \\"writing songs for old time vaudeville revues,\\" which has a particularly personal resonance given the criticism Davies and the Kinks received for performing music hall songs instead of the rock songs fans and critics expected. The personal perspective is reflected in the question which ends the song, asking \\"what's it all leading to?\\" Davies has stated about the song that \\"We had all the trappings of that success around us, but there I was, in the middle of it all, asking the question 'Who am I?' I was really concerned about who I was. So the hotel was just a symbol for my isolation. The song ought to be subtitled 'Who am I trying to kid?'\\" The song doesn't only reflect Ray Davies' feelings, but those of the other band members as well. Kinks guitarist Dave Davies has stated that \\"it doesn't matter how luxurious your surroundings are, you go back to your hotel room and it is like a prison. We used to do 11, 12, 13 month tours of America and leave our families at home because we couldn't afford to bring them over. It was hell.\\" The primary instrumentation is John Gosling's piano. Gosling also plays Hammond organ. Other instruments include Ray Davies on acoustic guitar, Dave Davies on electric guitar, John Dalton on bass guitar, Mick Avory on drums and Mike Cotton on trumpet. Ray Davies sings the lead vocal with Dave Davies providing backup vocals. Music critic Johnny Rogan describes the melody as \\"charming,\\" and Rolling Stone critic Bob Palmer describes it as \\"beautiful.\\" Reception Music critic Johnny Rogan regards \\"Sitting in My Hotel\\" one of the two or three indispensable songs on Everybody's in Show-Biz, describing the lyrics as \\"thoughtful,\\" \\"self- deprecating\\" and \\"self-analytical.\\" Rolling Stone critic Bob Palmer calls the song \\"a bona fide Kinks Klassic, dreamily wistful with a beautiful melody and featuring 'the exquisite Mr. John Gosling at the pianoforte.'\\" Ole Jacob Hoel of Adresseavisen described it and \\"Celluloid Heroes,\\" also from Everybody's in Show-Biz as \\"two of history's finest pop songs.\\" However, music critic John Mendelsohn finds a note of self-pity in Davies singing about \\"how used he feels.\\" Kinks' pianist Gosling considers \\"Sitting in My Hotel\\" to be \\"really good,\\" despite not being as impressed with most of the songs on Everybody's in Show-Biz. Other appearances Subsequent to its initial appearance on Everybody's in Show-Biz, \\"Sitting in My Hotel\\" was included on several Kinks' compilation albums, including The Kinks' Greatest: Celluloid Heroes and Picture Book. In 1973 it was released as the B-side of the Kinks' single \\"Sweet Lady Genevieve\\" in Europe.

Written by Ray Davies, the song appeared on the band's 1983 album State of Confusion. Background \\"Heart of Gold\\" is an acoustic ballad in half-time. Music critic John Mendelsohn describes it as being country music-ish. Musician magazine finds the guitar work reminiscent of the Kinks earlier album Muswell Hillbillies. It was, according to Ray Davies, written about the birth of his and Pretenders front woman Chrissie Hynde's daughter, Natalie, in 1983. According to Davies, it was also inspired by a comment by Anne, Princess Royal in which she told intrusive photographers to \\"naff off.\\" Davies has stated that \\"I wrote about it imagining I was a photographer, but really it was about Chrissie having her first baby. Both she and Princess Anne seem to be quite anonymous people at times.\\" However, Mendelsohn does not find the claim that the song was inspired by Princess Anne to be very credible. Musician describes the song's protagonist as being \\"tough but tender.\\" Mendelsohn describes her as having \\"an abrasive exterior and a new baby daughter.\\" The song was recorded in early 1983, at the same time as \\"Young Conservatives\\" (which precedes the song in State of Confusion's running order).

In the years 1997-2010 according to another local government plan, with the name Kapodistrias, the village used to belong to the former Municipality of Lampeia, as the capital of the former municipal unit of Astras. Near the village in a lower altitude there is a settlement named Kaluvia of Astras. A mountain road which goes through a forest with breathtaking landscapes connects Astras with the capital of the municipal unit of Lampeia, the village of Lampeia or Divri. Population According to the census of 2001 the former municipal unit of Astras had 407 inhabitants whilst the village itself had 196. The first recorded census was held in 1700 by Francisco Grimani from Venice. The village had 174 inhabitants and in detail 34 families (92 men and 82 women). History The region of Astras is inhabited from the ancient years as a few kilometers away in the nearby village of Tripotama there was the ancient city of Psophis which is mentioned even in Iliad. In particular Astras in ancient time was a part of Ancient Psofis, a big city-state of Western Peloponnese, and actually some sculptures and other things of daily use of this time were found in the modern settlement of Kaluvia of Astras. Astras history though begins mostly in the Byzantine years. A significant fact happened in the proto Byzantine years when Alaric the Great destroyed Ancient Psofis in 398 A.C. In fact the historian Zosimus who wrote about the area 50 years after the destruction of the city of Psofis informs us that few of the citizens returned to the destroyed cities and that the signs of the destruction were significant. The most significant fact though of the village itself is the “Asketerion of Nousa” (Nousa is the old name of Astras). After the fall of the Byzantine Empire the village became part of the Republic of Venice. Astras or Nousa (the name of the village that time) belonged to the teritorium of Kalavryta and in 1700 the census of Grimani took place. According to this census the 174 inhabitants of the village place Nousa in the high populated villages of the region. During the Ottoman Occupation the villagers suffered a lot from Ottoman rule and especially from the Bay of Lala, a close big city in the Ottoman times .Thus The Nousaites, that is how are called even today the villagers, became klephts, fighters who use to spend their life in the mountain seeking for freedom. Many heroes of the Greek revolution were from Nousa. According to the National Library of Greece some of the Nousa’s characters in the Greek struggle for freedom were Nikolaos Koulis, Chrysanthos Koulis, Demetrius Karachioutis, Konstantinos Stathopoulos, Vasileios Makris, Aggellis Makris and the weelknown Panagiotes Makris (Makropanagos). The last was a relative of the famous Giannias who became the terror of the Turkalbanians of a big region containing villages of Patrai .After the liberation and the constitution of the first free Greek state, Nousa became part of Municipality of Lampeia. Today Today the village of Astras still claims to be a living village despite the fact of being surrounded by big mountains. The village retains the traditional character of the whole region. There is a fest in the village for Saint George who is considered to be the protector of the village. The majority of the villagers of Astras is activated in the domain of agriculture. The village in the summer time has some ecotourists who visit for the natural environment - including the forest and the river that goes through the village. It is the river of Erymanthos where Hercules is said to have captured the Erymanthian boar. The Asketerion The Asketerion of Astras is a two floor building which was built inside the mountain in a big rock. In the left of the entrance there is a ladder made of the rock which leads to the upper floor where there is a small chapel which nice with the most significant picture being the one with Virgin Mary (Platytera). Near the Asketerion there is the ruins of the old church of Saint John. The building of Asketerion was made by Osios Meletios in the 9th century, who had established many Monasteries in the region of Astras and in other neighboring regions. Astras, the poem In 1930 Theodoros Ksudis from Elia wrote a poem with the name Astras: Greek: > Αστρά, περήφανε Αστρά, βαθιά θεμελιωμένε, που καμαρώνεις άσειστος, ωραίε κι > αγριεμένε, Κρύβεις απέθαντες ψυχές μέσ’ στα πυκνά σου ελάτια και δείχνεσαι > στον ουρανό σαν ουρανός με μάτια...

Drane Burdick currently resides in Orlando, Florida and has one daughter.  Career  Linda Drane Burdick began work at the State Attorney's Office on October 10, 1989. She has prosecuted numerous high-profile felony cases. In 2001, she won a conviction over Theodore Rodgers Jr., who on Valentine’s Day shot and killed his wife at a day care center because, he said, he believed she was having an affair with her ex-husband. Rodgers was sentenced to death. She successfully convicted Franklin Lee Reed in 2003 for the 1986 rape and murder of 13-year- old Mollie Pittman, a Lockhart Junior High school student. Pittman's body was found in a Needles Drive home on May 11, 1986—stabbed 12 times with an ice pick.

Anthony was acquitted of the murder charges on July 5, 2011. Those who have worked with Drane Burdick describe her as resilient, meticulous, driven, dogged and even a bit aloof. But, they add, a certain amount of emotional distance is to be expected from anyone who has remained sane after 23 years prosecuting alleged child abusers, sexual predators, murderers and rapists. Drane Burdick was one of 23 candidates being considered to fill a vacant judicial seat in the Ninth Circuit Judicial Court in February 2012.http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-02-13/news/os-casey-prosecutor- wants-to-be-judge-20120213_1_casey-anthony-prosecutor-linda-drane-burdick- judge-job Ultimately, she was not appointed to the position.http://www.ninthcircuit.org/judges/circuit_judges/In August 2012, State Attorney Elect, Jeff Ashton, named Drane Burdick as his Chief Assistant State Attorney. Drane Burdick returned to the courtroom in November 2013 as lead prosecutor in the State of Florida vs. Jason Rodriguez. Rodriguez was accused of a mass shooting in an office complex in downtown Orlando, FL that left five people injured and one dead in November 2009.After days of complex testimony delving into the mind of a killer, prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick told jurors that the case against the Gateway Center shooter boiled down to one question alone: \\"Did Jason Rodriguez know it was wrong to kill people?\\" Less than 3 1/2 hours later, a 12-member jury returned its verdict: Rodriguez was guilty of first-degree murder in the shooting death of 26-year-old Otis Beckford,http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/os-orlando- shooting-otis-beckford-pictures,0,3739298.photogallery and five counts of attempted first-degree murder for wounding five other people Nov. 6, 2009.

Casey Anthony Trial  The trial began on May 24, 2011, at the Orange County Courthouse, with Judge Belvin Perry presiding. Linda Drane Burdick was the lead attorney for the state of Florida while Jeffrey Ashton and Frank George served as co-counsel. In the opening statements of the widely publicized trial, Linda Drane Burdick described the story of the disappearance of Caylee Anthony day-by-day. The state alleged an intentional murder and sought the death penalty against Casey Anthony. Prosecutors stated that Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious before putting duct tape over her nose and mouth to suffocate her, and left Caylee's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. They painted Anthony as a party girl who killed her daughter to free herself from parental responsibility and enjoy her personal life. Caylee Marie Anthony had been missing for 31 days before police were called. Four hundred pieces of evidence were presented and the trial lasted 33 days, concluding on July 4, 2011. On July 5, 2011, after deliberating 11 hours over the course of 2 days, the Pinellas County, Florida jury acquitted Casey Anthony of first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter of a child, or aggravated child abuse. She was convicted on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer.

It contains a synaxarion, a short collection of saints' lives, compiled at Constantinople for liturgical use, and around 430 miniature paintings by eight different artists. It was unusual for a menologion from that era to be so richly painted. It currently resides in the Vatican Library (Ms. Vat. gr. 1613). A full facsimile was produced in 1907.Codices e Vaticanis selecti phototypice expressi ivssv Pii. PP. X consilio et opera cvratorvm Bibliothecae vaticanae. [Series maior] no. 8, Fratelli Bocca, Turin, Italy, 1907.  Description  The manuscript is not technically a menologion, but a synaxarion: a liturgical book containing a list of the saints and their feast days with a short description of sixteen lines of text and a painting of a saint or grouping of saints. The more than 430 images are important examples of hagiography, the veneration of saints, in Byzantine illumination. Text and images cover only half of the religious calendar of the Byzantine liturgical year (September to February), so it is assumed that there was a second volume to the work, but this was probably never produced, since some pages within the manuscript were left unfinished. The miniatures themselves have no liturgical role—it's possible that their purpose was to act as protectors of the Emperor. The manuscript inspired the illustration of a number of subsequent menologia.The glory of Byzantium, The work glorifies Emperor Basil II showing him as a warrior defending Orthodox Christendom against the attacks of the Bulgarian Empire, whose attacks on Byzantium are graphically illustrated. Even figures like the archangels were depicted in military guise by the painters.  History  The manuscript was copied and painted at Constantinople at the command of, or as a gift for, the Emperor Basil II. It was completed between 979 and the early years of the 11th century. In the course of the 14th century it came into the possession of a Genoese doctor who resided in Constantinople. In the 15th century it was acquired by Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. At the beginning of the 17th century the cardinal Paolo Emilio Sfondrati gave it to Pope Paul V and the manuscript now resides in the Vatican library.The glory of Byzantium, p.100  Artists  Bulgar soldiers slaughter Christians, from the Menologion of Basil II, 10th century. The artists who produced the images for the Menologion employed perspective and moved away from the flat depictions common up to that time. The figures' gestures and drapery are depicted in a lifelike manner, with architecture and backgrounds well-rendered. Facial expressions are painted in a naturalistic style. The work thus demonstrates the painting style of the period which is often referred to as the Macedonian Renaissance in which painters returned to ancient models with gusto. Unusual for a Byzantine manuscript, the name of the painter of each illustration is recorded by a scribe at the edge of each image. A total of eight names can be recognised. One painter, by the name of Pantoleon, who may be referred to in other documents of the time, seems to have been in charge of the group. They likely worked together in a workshop connected to the Imperial court. The other painters are Georgios, Michael the Younger, Michael of Blachernai, Simeon, Simeon of Blachernai, Manas, and Nestor. The names are not the signatures of the artists themselves, since they are all recorded in the same handwriting. It is very rare for artistic works from the Middle Ages to record the name of the artist, since it was not the individual artist so much as the meaning of the image which was most important. The reason for the recording of the names of the painters below their works in the Menologion of Basil II is not clear. Gallery Further reading * Il Menologio di Basilio II (cod.

It was written by the Australian anthropologist Lynne Hume and first published in 1997 by Melbourne University Press. Hume first encountered the Pagan movement in Canada, before beginning to explore Pagan groups in her native Australia. Background =Academic fieldwork into Paganism= Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of Pagan studies had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practising Wiccan, journalist and political activist Margot Adler in her Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today, which was first published by Viking Press in 1979.Adler 1979. A second study was produced by the anthropologist Tanya M. Luhrmann in her Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.Luhrmann 1989. This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest. =Hume and her research= Lynne Hume had been born and raised into the Christian faith but maintained an interest in non-Christian beliefs and societies, becoming a religious pluralist and leading her to study the discipline of anthropology.Hume 1997. p. xi. Hume was introduced to the Pagan movement while in Canada during the early 1990s. Attending a Unitarian church in Calgary, it was here that a group of Wiccans had been invited to give a talk on their magico-religious practices during a Sunday morning service. Intrigued, she joined two separate Wiccan covens; one, known as the Daughters of the Moon, was exclusively for women, while the other was a mixed gender group. She remained in these groups for a year before returning to Australia in 1992.Hume 1997. pp. 2-3. Back in her homeland, she began looking for Pagan groups here as well, encountering several Pagan individuals in Queensland before attending the second annual Pagan Summer Gathering (PSG), which was organised by the Church of All Worlds and held in the rural outskirts of Canberra. Although knowing nobody at the festival, she took part in the rituals which took place over the next five days, including a neoshamanic meditation, an runic women's rite, a tree planting ceremony and a Vodou-inspired ritual devoted to the goddess Oya.Hume 1997. pp. 3-6. In preparation for Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia, Hume spent five years among the Pagan community in both Canada and Australia, attending both private and public events including Sabbat festivals, workshops and conferences. She visited Wiccan covens in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, interviewing people both informally and formally. Immersing herself in the movement, she made many Pagan friends, noting that it became \\"not only a research project, but a highly enjoyable pastime.\\" Alongside her active participation, Hume also made a study of most of the available literature on the subject, subscribing to Pagan newsletters and researching in the archives of the Canberra Occult Reference Centre, Murdoch University and at the Theosophical Society in Brisbane. She also sent out questionnaires through various Pagan newsletters and gatherings, attaining responses through a snowball sampling method.Hume 1997. pp. 14-15. Synopsis Chapter one, entitled \\"Doing is Knowing: Introduction and Approach\\", begins with an introduction to the new religious movement of contemporary Paganism. This is followed by Hume's discussion of how she first encountered and came to study the Pagan movement, while the chapter is then rounded off with a discussion of the anthropological methodology that she adopted in her investigation. The second chapter offers a brief historical outline of the Pagan and Wiccan movements, and their arrival in Australia. The third looks at commonly held beliefs in the Pagan community, such as their moral values, their respect for nature, and their cosmological views, while the fourth examines the organisation and structure of the movement, looking at how individuals and embrace and convert to it, and how Wiccan covens operate. Chapter five offers an examination of rites of passage and the process of ritual in Paganism and Wicca, while the sixth looks at Pagan belief in magic. The following chapter discusses Pagan experiental and emotional experiences and beliefs regarding other realms, and the eighth looks at morality and ethics in the movement alongside its relation with legality. In her conclusion, Hume discusses the movement's attraction for those with feminist and environmentalist attitudes. Reviews Emma Tomalin of Lancaster University reviewed the work for Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions. Tomalin notes that Hume did not look specifically at the uniquely Australian features of contemporary Paganism, and tends toward being \\"descriptive rather than discursive\\", thereby appealing more to those \\"interested in an overview of contemporary Pagan belief and practice than those who wish to explore its wider political or social implications.\\" See also * Paganism in Australia References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= : : : : : Category:1997 non-fiction books Category:Academic studies of ritual and magic Category:Anthropology books Category:Religious studies books Category:Neopaganism in Australia Category:Pagan studies books Category:Religion in Australia ","title":"Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia"},{"id":"36739888","text":"Christopher Francis Evans (7 November 1909 – 30 July 2012) was an English Anglican priest and theologian who became known as an authority on the New Testament. He also served as lecturer in theology at Corpus Christi College at the University of Oxford from 1948 to 1958 and was later made an Emeritus Fellow. Early life and education Born in Small Heath, Birmingham, on 7 November 1909, to businessman Frank Evans and his wife Beatrice, Evans attended King Edward's School, renowned for its track record of producing theologians and Christian leaders, such as Edward Benson, once Archbishop of Canterbury. His classmates at the school at the time included the future Conservative MP Enoch Powell. After gaining a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, he became influenced by Sir Edwyn Clement Hoskyns who encouraged emphasis on literary forms used in the Bible, including songs, proverbs and stories. He graduated in 1932 with first-class honours. He later spent a year being taught by Michael Ramsey at Lincoln Theological College before serving four years in parochial ministry in Southampton. Career in theology Evans returned to the college in Lincoln in 1938 as a member of the teaching staff. The institute struggled during the Second World War, with a reduction of pupil intakes, as well as interference of bombers in the nearby airspace. After six years at the college, he was offered a role by the Bishop of Lincoln at a teacher-training college in the chaplaincy, a role which he would fill for a term of four years. In 1948, he was elected as both a fellow and tutor of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he would soon become renowned for his tutoring in teachings of the New Testament beside the likes of J. R. Porter and Dennis Nineham. On 16 February 1956 he spoke at the Oxford Socratic Club along with the philosopher Basil Mitchell on \\"Mythology in the New Testament\\". After a decade at Corpus, he was appointed to Lightfoot Professorship of Divinity at Durham, but upon failing to settle in the city, he moved back south in 1962. For 15 years he taught as professor of New Testament studies at King's College London before retiring in 1977 to the village of Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire. Personal life In 1941, Evans married Elna Pasco. The couple remained together until Elna's death in 1980. They had one son, Jonathan, who later followed his father into holy orders. Evans struggled to come to terms with the death of his wife, despite living for a further 32 years. At the age of 98, Evans was asked about his age over a pub lunch, where he was quoted to have responded \\"Part of you feels that you shouldn't be here.\\" He celebrated his 100th birthday at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 2009. Evans died in Solihull on 30 July 2012, at the age of 102 and was survived by his son.

History of Parliament Online Life His mother was a sister of Alexander Nowell. He was baptised at Whalley, Lancashire, in 1542, and was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he became fellow, and in 1561 proceeded LL.B. Hammond addressed Queen Elizabeth in a short Latin speech when she visited his college on 9 August 1564. In 1569 he was created LL.D. and admitted a member of the College of Civilians. On 6 February 1570 he became commissary of the deaneries of the Arches, Shoreham, and Croydon; in 1573 commissary to the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral; a master of chancery in 1574; and chancellor of the diocese of London in 1575. Hammond acted on two commissions in 1577, one with reference to the restitution of goods belonging to Portuguese merchants, and the other concerning complaints of piracy preferred by Scots. In 1578 he attended the diet of Schmalkalden as a delegate from the English government, and in August 1580 went to Guernsey to investigate charges brought by the inhabitants against Sir Thomas Leighton, the governor. In the period March 1580 – 1581 Hammond took part in the examination by torture of Thomas Myagh, a prisoner in the Tower, charged with treasonable correspondence with Irish rebels. From 1572 onwards he was an active member of the ecclesiastical court of high commission.

Modern releases use this name, Have You Herd? or Superfarmer. Sales of the game were a way for Borsuk to support his family after he lost his job following the closure by the German occupation authorities of Warsaw University. The original sets were produced by hand by Borsuk's wife, Zofia. The author of the drawings of animals was Janina Borsuk née Śliwicka. The game was one of the first in the world to feature 12-sided dice. The game achieved great popularity, first among friends of the family and then among wider circles of friends and strangers. However, for decades, all copies were thought to have been lost during the Warsaw uprising and the aftermath of post-war chaos in Poland. But in the 1990s, a surviving set was found intact – and with the permission of the Borsuk family, and on the occasion of Borsuk's 90th birthday and the 15th anniversary of his death it was re-introduced into the Polish market under the title Superfarmer by the publisher GRANNA sp. In 2010 the original game was re-issued under the original title and with original graphics for the Warsaw Rising Museum and is available in its gift shop. The new edition was one of the items featured at the 1 Euro Design exhibition at Warsaw's Institute of Industrial Design.  Modern releases  In subsequent years the game has been released in various languages, including English, German and Italian. * In 2007, GRANNA released another Polish-language edition with a new graphic design by Peter Socha. * Winning Moves Games USA released the game in the English market under the title Have You Herd? in 2008. * A March, 2012 German-language release by Heidelberger Spielverlag also features Socha's design. * In Finland it won the title for Best Family Board Game in 2013.  Gameplay  In the modern release, Have You Herd?, the goal is to get one of each of the farm animals: rabbit, sheep, pig, cow, and horse. Each player begins the game with a single rabbit (though, it is suggested by Winning Moves to start with a rabbit and sheep for a faster game). On their turn, a player performs three steps. First, they see if they can trade by consulting a chart. They can turn in sets of animals to get a tile of a different animal (for example, 5 rabbits can be traded for 1 sheep tile). After trading, the player rolls the two 12-sided dice. If they roll an animal that matches a tile they have, they get another tile of that type (for example, a player has a rabbit and rolls one. That player would get a rabbit tile). If the player rolls doubles, they get to roll again. There are a number of special events on the dice as well, such as the wolf (causes you to be unable to multiply and causes the player to roll the two dice and lose the animals shown unless they have a guard dog), the fox (cannot multiply animals, eats all but one rabbit unless you have the guard dog), the guard dog (protects you from a future wolf and foxes), the skunk (allows you to cause another player to miss their next turn), and the trade \\"T\\" (allows you to only trade with opponents instead of the bank). The game ends once one player has a rabbit, sheep, pig, cow, and horse.

It was last active with the Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command, based at Eglin Field, Florida, where it was disbanded on 1 April 1944. The unit's personnel/equipment/mission was taken over by the 610th Army Air Forces Base Unit (AAF Base Unit) and 611th AAF Base Unit. The group was originally established as the 23d Composite Group and was part of the Air Corps Tactical School with a mission that focused on developing and demonstrating tactics and doctrine. After moving to Eglin it also conducted testing of experimental weapons.

The impracticability of scheduling a recently trained unit with modern aircraft for these demonstrations led the school to recommend the formation of a composite unit permanently stationed with the school as early as 1932. The recommendation was disapproved because of the lack of personnel or equipment that could be dedicated to this mission. The establishment of the group was finally approved in August 1939, with the understanding that the group would also assume the demonstration and exhibition function that was being carried out by combat units of Air Force Combat Command., pp. 18-19 The group was also assigned the mission of performing tactical service tests of aircraft and other equipment; developing and testing new air tactics; and demonstrating these new tactics to the service schools of the other branches of the Army, to General Headquarters, and at Air Corps stations. However, because the Tactical School suspended classes in June 1940, because experienced officers were required for the expansion of the Air Corps in response to the war in Europe and could not be spared for a nine-month-long school, the group was only able to support the school for a short time. In September 1940, the group moved to Orlando Army Air Base, Florida, which would become the base for the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics.Finney, pp. 41-42 The group transferred from Orlando for assignment to Eglin Field to conduct flight testing activities in July 1941. At Eglin it was redesignated as the Air Corps Proving Ground Detachment, then the Air Corps Proving Ground Group. On 1 May 1942, the group's three original squadrons were disbanded as it focused on weapons development rather than tactics.

Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.

Early life Ángel D'Meza Hernández was born January 1,1877, in Havana, Cuba, to Ramón D'Meza and Agustina Hernández. His wife was Dorotea Delgado. A Spanish–American War veteran, fought under rules of Theodore Roosevelt in the Battle of San Juan Hill on July 1, 1898 near Santiago de Cuba with the rank of Private. Events The Almendares nicknamed the team \\"Los Alacranes\\" (The Scorpions) by pitcher Angel D'Meza during his tenure with the club (1903, 1905–1907) creating the slogan of the franchise. In 1952, the Almendares club honored D'Meza in a ceremony at Havana's baseball stadium for having given the team its nickname and mascot. He was presented with a silver scorpion paperweight and a gold scorpion lapel pin, along with a commemorative scroll. He died on October 8, 1954 at the age of 77. He is buried at the Christopher Columbus Cemetery inside the American Veteran's Pantheon in Havana. Statistical history Angel D'Meza began his career as a baseball player in 1898 with team \\"Fe\\" at the age of 21, but due to the Independence War baseball games were suspended. In 1901 at the age of 24 he returned to the pages of the Cuban League with the team Cuba, or \\"Cubano\\". It was reported that he lost 9 games as a pitcher that year.

Sutherland-Caithness feud Map showing the territory of the Clan Mackay that was known as Strathnaver in relation to Sutherland and Caithness. The boundary is marked with a dashed line. (click to enlarge) In the later half of the 16th century in the far north of Scotland Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland (chief of Clan Sutherland) and George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness (chief of Clan Sinclair) were at deadly feud with each other. Alexander Gordon, Earl of Sutherland was supported by his relative George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly (chief of Clan Gordon), whose sister the Earl of Sutherland married. Between the two sides was Huistean Mackay who supported both but was in a weak position, being at the head of a divided clan. The dispute among the Clan Mackay was over who was the rightful chief. Some believed that John Beg Mackay and Donald Balloch Mackay who were born from Iye Du Mackay's first marriage were rightful chiefs.Mackay, Angus. Page 108. However, this marriage was an irregular one under canon law as it was a marriage of first cousins. Others supported Huistean Mackay. When Huistean obtained legal possession of his lands he gave Scourie to Donald Balloch Mackay, only surviving son from the first marriage. This served as a settlement but the two families remained disunited. Huistean Mackay and his younger brother William Mackay, 1st of Bighouse were initially supporters of George Sinclair, Earl of Caithness. Huistean had even resided at Castle Sinclair Girnigoe until he was old enough to lead his own clan. In the meantime John Beg Mackay had been in control of the Mackay lands of Strathnaver; however the Earl of Caithness had instigated the Mackays of Aberach, a powerful and very much independent branch of the Mackays to attack him on a plea of alleged unfaithfulness to Huistean Mackay. The Mackays of Aberach did this along with the MacLeods of Assynt, killing John Beg Mackay, William Gunn (chieftain of the Robson Gunns) and others at Balnakeil in the parish of Durness in 1579, and the chieftain of Clan Matheson barely escaped with his life. This left Huistean Mackay's followers divided. On the one side were the Robson Gunns and Mathesons and on the other side were the MacLeods of Assynt and the Mackays of Aberach. Huistean Mackay chose to oppose the Aberachs.Mackay, Angus. Page 100. The Aberach Mackays then rushed to the open arms of the Earl of Sutherland. Historian Angus Mackay states that as long as Huistean Mackay and Sinclair, Earl of Caithness stood together they were more than a match for the Earl of Sutherland, notwithstanding the defection of some Mackay clansman (the Aberachs).Mackay, Angus. Page 110. By 1585 Gordon, Earl of Sutherland and Gordon, Earl of Huntly stood together with the support of the Aberach Mackays and the MacLeods of Assynt.Mackay, Angus. Page 111.

In 1585 Gordon, Earl of Sutherland and Gordon, Earl of Huntly held a meeting at Elgin along with Sinclair, Earl of Caithness in an attempt to break up Sinclair's confederacy with Huistean Mackay and the Gunns. Sinclair was offered Huntly's sister in marriage if he destroyed the Gunns. A second meeting was called at Dunrobin Castle in which Huistean Mackay also attended. Mackay refused the Gordon's proposals but Sinclair, Earl of Caithness agreed with the Gordons that the Gunns should be destroyed. In 1586 the forces of the Earl of Caithness and the Earl of Sutherland pursued the Gunns from Caithness and into the hills of Strathnaver. At this time a strange coincidence took place: William Mackay of Bighouse (younger brother of Huistean) had raided the MacLeods taking much cattle.Mackay, Angus. Page 111 – 112. As William Mackay was returning home he came across the Earl of Sutherland's men who were searching for the Gunns and a fight took place over the cattle. William Mackay's men fought a rear guard action and the following morning stumbled across the Gunns who were retiring from the Sinclairs of Caithness.Mackay, Angus. Page 112. Together the Mackays and Gunns attacked the Sinclairs of Caithness defeating them and killing their leader Henry Sinclair, cousin of the Earl of Caithenss. This was known as the Battle of Allt Camhna. Castle Sinclair Girnigoe, as painted in 1821 Huistean Du Mackay at this time had been residing at Castle Sinclair Girnigoe and had to flee for his life back to Strathnaver and the Gunns, realizing the Mackays could not protect them retired to Ross-shire only to be defeated at the Battle of Leckmelm by the Mackays of Aberach, MacLeods and Sutherlands. The new alliance between Gordon, Earl of Sutherland and Sinclair, Earl of Caithness did not last long and soon they were feuding again. In February 1587 the Sinclairs killed Gordon of Marle and made preparations to invade Sutherland.Mackay, Angus. Page 113. In March the Earl of Caithness, supported by Huistean Du Mackay advanced on Sutherland where they found the Earl supported by Mackintosh, Mackenzie of Redcastle and Munro of Contullich Castle, who were posted on the west bank of the river.Mackay, Angus. Page 114. For some days there was skirmishing between the two armies on both sides of the water. The Earl of Sutherland sent Mackintosh across to try and persuade Huistean Mackay to desert the Earl of Caithness. The Earl of Sutherland himself also met with the Earl of Caithness who agreed terms that excluded Mackay. On hearing of this Mackay marched his men back to Strathnaver, thus ending the alliance between Mackay and Caithness. In December 1589 Huistean Mackay married Lady Jane Gordon, daughter of the Earl of Sutherland.Mackay, Angus. Page 115. The Earl of Sutherland having gained the support of Mackay swept into Caithness accompanied by Mackay, Mackintosh and Munro. They swept the county to the walls of Castle Sinclair Girnigoe. The castle was too strong to take without artillery and so they sacked the town of Wick. The family of Sinclair never again held the same commanding position in northern politics.Mackay, Angus. Pages 115 - 116. That same year McHamish Gunn, chief of the Clan Gunn again wasted Caithness with great ferocity.Mackay, Angus. Page 116. In 1590 the Earl of Caithness invaded Sutherland in person fighting stubbornly and advancing as far as Brora. In the meantime Mackay slipped into Caithness and spoiled it to the gates of Thurso. The feud continued for many years after. In 1601 the Earl of Caithness's army lined up in front of the Earl of Sutherland's which included Huistean Mackay, Munro of Contullich and MacLeod of Assynt. The Caithness men retreated without a fight.Mackay, Angus. Page 119. A contemporary historian Sir Robert Gordon writes of Huistean Du Mackay in one of the battles against the forces of Sinclair, Earl of Caithness:Mackay, Angus. Page 116. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert. Page 199. Later life and family Huistean Du Mackay's first marriage was to Lady Elizabeth Sinclair, daughter of George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness, whom he divorced but had had one daughter with, Christina who married John Mackintish of Davell, son the chief of Clan Mackintosh.Mackay, Angus. Page 123. He married secondly (as mentioned above) Lady Jane Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, and had the following two sons and two daughters: #Donald Mackay, 1st Lord Reay, heir and successor as chief of the Clan Mackay. #John Mackay, 1st of Strathy, also progenitor of the Mackays of Skerray. #Annas Mackay, who married John Sinclair of Brims. #Mary Mackay, who married Sir Hector Munro, 1st Baronet, chief of the Clan Munro.

He bears responsibility for part of the mine and the people subordinated to him. The name is derived from the former role of a Steiger, who continually had to climb into and out of the pit.Heinrich Veith: Deutsches Bergwörterbuch mit Belegen. Verlag von Wilhelm Gottlieb Korn, Breslau 1871 The Steiger is celebrated in a very popular German mining song the so-called Steigerlied (Glückauf, Glückauf; der Steiger kommt …).  Historical role  In medieval and early modern times, the state mining regulations obliged mining companies to employ pit officials for the supervision of their mines. Until the mid-19th century, these officials were civil servants. The term Steiger for these pit officials became established very early on in the mining regulations. The hiring and firing of pit officials was the responsibility of the mining authority or Bergamt; at best the mine owners had a say and could impress their wishes on the Bergmeister in this regard. With the reform of mining law in the years from 1851 to 1865, there was a change in the official status of the Steiger. The Steiger was no longer a state official, but a private officer.Helmuth Trischler: Steiger im deutschen Bergbau - Zur Sozialgeschichte der technischen Angestellten 1815-1945. Beck, Munich, 1986, Despite this change, Steigers continued to be employed by the mining authority.Otto Hue.

Thomas's mother Elizabeth was living at Newenden.) However Slaney died in 1617, before he could inherit, and therefore John the second son became the heir of Wigsell. John, the future John Colepeper, 1st Baron Colepeper of Thoresway (1600-1660), in time became a leading royalist politician during the 1640s and 1650s.Attree and Booker, 'The Sussex Colepepers', at pp. 64-67 (Internet Archive).

It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.06. With an annual parallax shift of 39.62 mas as seen from Earth, this star is located 82.3 light years from the Sun. Based upon the motion of this system through space, it is a potential member of the Castor Moving Group. The primary, component A, is a white-hued A-type main sequence star of apparent visual magnitude 4.08 with a stellar classification of A9 V. The star has an estimated 1.81 times the mass of the Sun and around 1.3 times the Sun's radius. It is about 757 million years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 144 km/s. The primary is radiating 18.8 times the solar luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 8,020 K. Based upon the detection of an infrared excess, the star may host an orbiting debris disk. However, this finding remains in doubt. The companion, component B, is a magnitude 9.6 star with an estimated mass 75% that of the Sun. As of 2010, the companion was located at an angular separation of 4.98 arc seconds along a position angle of 93.1° relative to the primary. This is equivalent to a projected separation of 125.6 AU. This star may be the source of the X-ray emission detected coming from this system.

It introduced the single-arm pantograph in 1955. The company has subsidiaries in more than 24 countries. The majority of Faiveley Transport's outstanding stock is owned by Wabtec Corporation, which acquired majority stock ownership from the Faiveley family in 2016. History =First years= In 1919, Louis Faiveley founded in Saint Ouen, France, the Établissments Louis Faiveley, a small assembly shop centered on electromechanical parts. It soon grew and became one of the French railway system's leading suppliers. It introduced in 1923 its first pantograph. In 1930, it also ventured in the manufacture of door systems for trains. By the 30s, it was already one of France's leading companies in all its fields of activity. In 1935, the company became a Societé Anonyme, although the shares' majority stayed in hands of the Faiveley family. After the Second World War, the company quickly recovered. In 1946, it introduced electric heating systems. In 1955, it helped set a new high-speed train record, as a Faiveley-equipped train exceeded 331 kilometres per hour. That year, Faiveley also introduced the first single-arm pantograph. This innovation helped the company to ensure its position as world leader in railway pantograph systems. =Internationalisation= In 1961, the company created a research and development division with the aim of adapting electronic applications to the railroad industry, included automatic door systems. It also begun to equipe the new rubber-wheeled Paris Metro cars. In 1965, the company started to produce automatic doors for buildings, creating in 1968 a subsidiary specifically for this area: Faiveley Automatismes. The company continued its expansion. In 1966, it opened a subsidiary in Spain. In 1976, one in Brazil (Equipfer). In 1979, was created the Italian branch. Attempts to enter into the American and Canadian markets, however, were not as successful. Only in the late 90s it could settle in those countries. France remained as Faiveley's core market. During the 70s, the company introduced new corail coaches for the SNCF and provided equipment for a new generation of subway trains, the MF77. In 1972, Faiveley presented its first very-high-speed pantograph. Soon after, it introduced its first electric automated road system. In 1984, Faiveley purchased Saint-Gobain subsidiary Air-Industrie's transport division, giving it operations in passenger train air conditioning systems. That year, it acquired from the Matra's subsidiary Interlec its tachometry activities. Together with the company's other transportation- related activities, these subsidiary operations were gathered into a newly created subsidiary: Faiveley Transport. The company was one of the suppliers of the new SNCF's TGV trains. In 1990, its pantographs were key to achieve a new 513.3 kilometres per hour record by TGV Atlantique. In 1991, the company moved its headquarters to Saint-Pierre-des-Corps. =Diversification= Faiveley supplied the pantographs of the 1981, 1990 and 2007 TGV's record trains. With competition becoming more intense in its field of activity, Faiveley decided it was time to expand their operations. In 1992, the company acquired plastics product maker Grand-Perret. In 1993, Faiveley moved to concentrate its activities around its historic core of railroad and transportation equipment and its brand new plastics division, selling its Faiveley Automatismes subsidiary. It also made an aggressive move to increase its business in the Japanese market, one of the most important at the time, forming a joint venture with Nabco called Nabco-Faiveley Ltd which became one of leading providers of Japan's railroad. Later, Faiveley partnered also with Mitsui. That year Faivaley created a British subsidiary, to take a part of the business in the recently privatised rail system. In 1994, Faiveley was listed on the Paris Bourse. In 1995, it acquired VPI-Verchère Plastiques Industriels, a thermo-injected plastic company. The following year, Faiveley added the operations of Rhône Moulage and Sepal Ltd, two companies also centered in plastics. By the end of the decade, that material had risen to nearly 20 percent of Faiveley's total sales. In 1995. Faiveley purchased the German railroad air conditioning company Hagenuk Fahrzeugklima from its parent company Siemens. The purchase was a key step into the German market as well as the Asian through is Chinese subsidiary Shanghai Hagenuk Refrigerating Machine, but also brought losses to the company during the following years. This led to a reorganisation that included staff reductions in Germany and France and changes in the Board of Directors. In December 2002, Faiveley purchased a 75 percent stake in the Czech pantograph and electro-mechanical equipment supplier Lekov. In 2004, it acquired the train brakes manufacturer Sab Wabco and the air conditioning manufacturer Neu Systèmes. In early 2007, it purchased the electronic systems and rolling stock manufacturer ESPAS group. Faiveley CX pantographs were fitted in the V150 TGV's record-breaking attempt of 2007, which set a new world railway speed record of 574.8 kilometres per hour. In April 2008, the company acquired from Carbone Lorraine its sintered brake material manufacturing and design department. In July of that year, it purchased the American freight wagon components' manufacturer Ellcon-National. In September 2009 Faiveley SA and its subsidiary Faiveley Transport merged into a sole company, called Faiveley Transport SA. In March 2011, the company purchased an 80 percent stake in the rolling stock heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment manufacturer Urs Dolder AG and the remaining stake of Lekov. On 3 February 2012, Faiveley Transport completed the purchase of Graham-White, an American designer and manufacturer of compressed air drying and brake systems for rail transport. In February 2013, the company won a trial against Wabtec for the acts of unfair competition and secrets violation. On 30 November 2016, the 51% stake of the company controlled by the Faiveley family was purchased by Wabtec, giving Wabtec controlling interest in Faiveley Transport. Current activities The pantographs of the SNCB Class 13 were manufactured by Faiveley. Faiveley Transport offers a wide range of products related to the train equipment, such as cabin heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); HVAC system room, air distribution ducts, exhaust, urs dolder heaters; pantographs and high voltage switches, energy meters, auxiliary power converters, master controllers and driver awareness system. The company also provides access and information systems, such as platform screen doors and automatic platform gates, portal platform, door systems, passenger information systems and CCTV vigilance. In addition, it provides checks and security products, including couplers, odometry/tachometry systems and event recorders, brake control units, oil-free air generator BURAN, Nowe sanding, axle mounted disc, magnetictrack brake, disc brakes controllers, air generation and air treatment, and pantograph compressor. The company provides renovation, maintenance, installation and consultancy services, including torque and engineering maintenance and spare parts and logistics. It serves tram, metro, high speed locomotives, and regional market segments trains. =Acquisition by Wabtec Corporation= In December 2016, Wabtec Corporation acquired majority stock ownership of Faiveley Transport from the Faiveley family, who had owned about 51% of the outstanding shares, for €1.6 billion and 6.3 million shares of Wabtec's common stock. After tender offers for the remaining outstanding shares, Wabtec owned 98.53% of Faiveley stock, with 97.66% of the voting rights. Wabtec plans to complete the acquisition with a mandatory squeeze-out of the shares which were not tendered.

Written by Brad Falchuk and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, it aired on Fox in the United States on September 20, 2012, and features Glee second episode dedicated to the music of Britney Spears. This episode features the New Directions attempting to cheer up a depressed Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) with Britney Spears songs. Special guest star Kate Hudson returns as Rachel's dance instructor, Cassandra July. The episode was watched by 7.46 million viewers, making it the most watched episode of the fourth season. Plot In New York City, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) rent a small apartment and move in together. At the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA), Rachel continues to be pressured by her dance instructor, Cassandra July (Kate Hudson), who refuses to teach Rachel tango because she thinks she lacks sex appeal. Kurt reveals that Cassandra used to be a promising star on Broadway but wrecked her first performance so dramatically due to pressure that no one wanted to hire her again. Meanwhile, in Lima, Ohio, Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) once again finds her true identity as she performs Britney Spears's \\"Hold It Against Me\\" during cheerleading practice before being interrupted by coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), who kicks her off the Cheerios due to her bad grades and replaces her with Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin). This, in addition to the busy schedule of her girlfriend, Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), who is attending University of Louisville, causes Brittany to become depressed. Hoping to cheer her up, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) convinces glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to have New Directions perform Britney Spears' songs. Subsequently, Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) perform a mash- up of \\"Boys\\" and Justin Bieber's \\"Boyfriend\\", for Brittany, and she is once more inspired by Spears. New member Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) confides to Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) that she is interested in troublemaker Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), leading to a performance of \\"Womanizer\\", during which Jake invites Marley to \\"hang out\\". At the bleachers, Marley meets up with Jake and they perform a mash-up of \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" and Aerosmith's \\"Crazy\\", as they share a romantic moment. Jake later hears two students mocking Marley and her mother (Trisha Rae Stahl) and confronts them, leading to a fight. Will interrupts the altercation and sends Jake to the choir room, where he's surprised to find his half-brother Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman (Mark Salling), who now lives in Los Angeles. Puck introduces himself to Jake and convinces him to join New Directions, so that the experience can help Jake just as it helped him. In New York City, Rachel enlists the help of her friend, NYADA upperclassman Brody Weston (Dean Geyer), to prove to Cassandra that she can be sexy by performing a sultry rendition of \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\"; however, the number fails to impress Cassandra. Rachel accuses her of hating her students because they may have a future in show business, while Cassandra has none, leading an infuriated Cassandra to kick her out of her class. Brody later comforts Rachel and tries to kiss her, but she refuses, as she is still in love with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith). Brody agrees to respect Rachel's relationship, but admits he has feelings for her. Rachel apologizes to Cassandra and Cassandra allows her to come back to class. Cassandra then explains that show business is a world with a lot of harsh realities and she wants Rachel and her other students to be prepared for it and that is the reason why she is hard on her students. In Lima, Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) performs an acoustic version of \\"3\\" with Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) and Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen). Brittany attempts to shave her head and is stopped by Will, after which she walks into the hallway, only to be provoked by Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), who she beats up with an umbrella in front of the student body. To cheer Brittany up, New Directions members suggest she should lead the school assembly. Brittany objects that her voice is not up to par, and suggests they lip sync, an idea they rebuke at first, but she manages to convince them. New Directions performs \\"Gimme More\\" at the school assembly, but the performance is a disaster due to Brittany's lack of motivation, leading the student body to discover that Brittany was lip- synching to the song. They are booed off of the stage and reprimanded by Will in the choir room. Brittany resigns from the club and marches out of the room. Sam later invites Brittany to meet him at the auditorium, where she admits she staged her breakdown in order to have a more effective comeback, and tells him that she misses Santana. Sam tells Brittany that he will be her friend. Brittany later asks Sue to reinstate her on the Cheerios, and shows some marginal improvements on her grades. Sue agrees on the condition that Brittany's grades continue to improve so she can graduate. The following day, Jake tells Marley he is going to join New Directions, and learns that he is now dating Kitty. Jake joins New Directions, and an upset Marley performs \\"Everytime\\" in the choir room. As this plays, Brittany pines alone in her bedroom for Santana who is offline on iChat, and Rachel paints over a drawing of Finn's name that she had made on her apartment's wall.

We're doing a really cool version of it. It's going to be a little group number. It's going to be fun.\\" Eight songs featured in the episode have been released to iTunes as an extended play album entitled Britney 2.0, though not also as individual singles. Details on most of these have been reported: Morris sings \\"Hold It Against Me\\" and \\"Gimme More\\" by Spears, Michele performs \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\" as a big production number, McHale and Criss perform a mashup of \\"Boys\\" and Justin Bieber's \\"Boyfriend\\", a stripped-down acoustic version of Spears' \\"3\\" is performed by Ushkowitz, Overstreet and Larsen, \\"Everytime\\" is sung by Benoist, and a second mashup features \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\", called \\"U Drive Me Crazy\\", and Aerosmith's \\"Crazy\\", sung by Benoist and Artist. The eighth song is \\"Womanizer\\", performed by Newell, Benoist and Ushkowitz.

Description L. atrostipitatum caps are 7–20 cm across, convex, dry, minutely hairy to fibril-streaked, and buff to yellow-orange or ochre. Flesh is white, staining grey, then black. Tubes are grey-brown, staining as flesh. Pores are small, round and smokey to blackish-brown. Stalks are up to 20 cm tall by 3.5 cm wide, whitish, and with many raised, black dots. Spore print is yellow-brown to olive. Dark-Stalked Bolete fruits on the ground in mixed woods.George Barron: Mushrooms of Northeast North America Leccinum is a genus of fungi in the family Boletaceae. It was the name given first to a series of fungi within the genus Boletus, then erected as a new genus last century. Their main distinguishing feature is the small, rigid projections (scabers) that give a rough texture to their stalks. The genus name was coined from the Italian Leccino, for a type of rough-stemmed bolete. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in north temperate regions, and contains about 75 species. Stem of a Leccinum mushroom, showing the distinctive scabers Ecology and habitat Leccinum atrostipitatum Dark-Stalked Boletes fruit on the ground in mixed woods. \\"Leccinum species are generally found in the woodlands of Europe, Asia, and North America, forming ectomycorrhizal associations with trees. Most Leccinum species are mycorrhizal specialists, associating with trees of a single genus. Leccinum aurantiacum is an exception, however, occurring in mycorrhizal association with poplar, birch, and oak. Edibility L. atrostipitatum is a very good edible mushroom, as are Leccinum species in general for the most part. However, there are reports of gastric upset after consuming unidentified members of the genus in North America, even after thorough cooking. Certain species, such as L. insigne, are suspected (but not confirmed) to cause gastric upset after consumption. Most species of Leccinum often cause nausea when consumed raw, therefore insufficient cooking or inconsistent heating needs to be acknowledged as a consideration in these cases. The key to safe and successful cooking Leccinum species like this is preparation. A dry-saute is best. Clean and slice the mushrooms, then put them in a skillet on maximum heat with no butter or oil. sprinkle them with salt (to help draw out the moisture). Stir constantly until they begin to give off liquid, then let them cook in their own juices. After the liquid has evaporated (you can pour off some of it for use as stock), continue to cook them for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly again so they do not stick. Then turn down the heat, add a little olive oil or butter, and cook for another 5–10 minutes. They should be fairly chewy and full of flavor, not slimy, You can eat them as they are or incorporate them into any dish.

The grape was used by Louis' son, Henri Bouschet, to create several more varieties including Alicante Bouschet, Grand Noir de la Calmette and Morrastel Bouschet. Petit Bouschet saw a surge of plantings in the late 19th century as France recovered from the phylloxera epidemic where it was often used to add color to blends made from hybrid grapes and other high yielding varieties. As its offspring Alicante Bouschet became more popular, plantings of Petit Bouschet fell off and the grape is now hardly found in France.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 428 & 664 Allen Lane 2012 History and relationship to other grapes An example of the difference between a red fleshed teinturier grape (Agria left) and a red wine grape variety with its skin peeled off to show that its flesh and juice is naturally white (Grenache right). The vast majority of red wine grapes are like the Grenache on the right with the red color of wine coming from skin contact during winemaking. Petit Bouschet was created in 1824 by grape breeder Louis Bouschet at his Domaine de la Camette vineyard and breeding station near Montpellier in southern France. The grape is a crossing of two Vitis vinifera varieties, Aramon noir and the red-flesh Teinturier du Cher. This makes Petit Bouschet a crossing and not a hybrid grape which would have parents from two difference species from the genus Vitis. While Aramon noir is like most red-skinned Vitis vinifera varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, in having white flesh which yields white or greyish color juice when pressed soon after harvest, Petit Bouschet inherited red-flesh from Teinturier du Cher. This means that Petit Bouschet can produce red colored wine without needing long periods of skin contact to leach out the color compounds from the grape skins into the wine.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 414-415 Oxford University Press 2006 Louis Bouschet's son, Henri, would use Petit Bouschet to breed several more crossings including Alicante Bouschet (with Grenache), Grand Noir de la Calmette (with Aramon) and Morrastel Bouschet (with Graciano). In the early 21st century, some ampelographers suspected that Petit Bouschet may have been a parent vine for the Provençal wine grape Téoulier but DNA profiling has disproved that suggestion. The grape was also historically associated with the Galician wine grape Juan García dues to the similarities in synonyms, particularly with Petit Bouschet also being known as Negrón de Aldán in the Denominación de Origen (DO) region of Bierzo. However, DNA evidence has also dispelled any link between the two varieties. Viticulture Petit Bouschet is prone to developing excessive amounts of basal shoots (or \\"suckers\\") that grow on the trunk of the grape and sap needed resources away from other parts of the vine. Petit Bouschet is an early to mid-ripening variety that also buds early which can make it prone to damage from early spring frost in some areas. The vine can be very vigorous and high yielding if not kept in check by winter pruning and green harvesting. Petit Bouschet also has a tendency to produce numerous basal shoots that grow on the trunk of the grapevine below the cordons. Also known as \\"suckers\\", these shoots can sap the vine of nutritional and water resources that would otherwise be funneled into developing and ripening the grape clusters and will need to be removed throughout the growing season. Other viticultural hazards that Petit Bouschet is susceptible to include infection from erinose mites. Wine regions Petit Bouschet was widely planted throughout the southern wine regions of France in the late 19th century but today it is hardly found in the country with its offspring, Alicante Bouschet, largely taking over its role of adding color to wine blends. There are some plantings of the grape in North Africa, particularly Algeria, and in 2009 there were of the Petit Bouschet growing in Portugal. Synonyms Over the years, Petit Bouschet has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Aramon-Teinturier, Bouschet, Bouschet de Bernard, Bouschet Petit, Le Bouschet, Negrón de Aldán (in Bierzo region in Spain), Petit Bouse, Pit Bushe and Tintinha (in Portugal).Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Petit Bouschet Accessed: May 26th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Petit Bouschet"},{"id":"36740586","text":"The I Central American Games (Spanish: I Juegos Deportivos Centroamericanos) was a multi-sport event that took place between 24 November - 2 December 1973.

Sülde Tngri is an equestrian war god, one of the tngri, the highest group of divinities in Mongolian shamanism. He is usually depicted as an armored warrior riding a horse. In Mongolian shamanism, everyone possesses a guardian spirit, called a sülde. \\"Sülde Tngri\\" can refer to the sülde of any great leader, but it primarily refers to the deified sülde of Genghis Khan. As a war god, Sülde Tngri's primary function is protecting his devotees from their enemies and aiding them in battles against their foes.  Descriptions and appearance  The exact details of Sülde Tngri's appearance and entourage vary among artwork of him. He has been illustrated as a man wearing armor and a helmet adorned by triangular flags or banners, armed with a club and wreathed in fire. He is mounted on a yellow horse, tended to by a servant clothed in white. In this portrayal, he has a demon held captive. Another description has Sülde Tngri clothed in white silk and carrying both a spear and a lance, riding a white horse. In other images, he has been represented by a man with a spear and a flag, riding a horse.  Rituals and symbolism  Sülde Tngri's primary sphere of influence is protection from mortal enemies. Rituals invoking his aid usually describe him and his entourage only briefly, but some give more elaborate, detailed accounts of his interventions. He is the major local god around the Muna community, although his status as a minor god elsewhere is simultaneously acknowledged. = Association with Genghis Khan = Sülde Tngri is most often identified with Genghis Khan. As his sülde, Sülde Tngri represents the embodiment of Genghis Khan in his martial character, excluding the other aspects of the historical figure's personality. The white horse that sometimes appears in descriptions of Sülde Tngri has been thought to represent Genghis's deified horse. In illustrations, the god and the mortal man resemble each other; this has created some confusion over which entity is being portrayed. Sülde Tngri is also sometimes confused with similar equestrian warrior deities, such as Dayisun Tngri.

It stars Eddie Marsan and Rob Brydon. The film won the Philadelphia Jewish Film Festival 34 Best Narrative Audience Award. Plot Ludwig Guttmann (Marsan) is a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, sponsored to stay in the United Kingdom by CARA, while his patients were injured British servicemen, initially bewildered at finding themselves under the care of one of \\"the enemy\\". On arrival at the hospital, the patients are kept under sedation, and immobile in bed, a regime leading to bedsores, infection, and, in many cases, death. Dr Guttman insists that the best prognosis for the patients is if they are as mobile as possible. This leads him to clash with the existing staff of nurses and doctors at the hospital, who are accustomed to merely managing the decline of their patients. As he gradually wins the staff over with his determination and optimism, Guttmann faces a further problem in the hopelessness of some of the patients, particularly exemplified by the youngest inmate, William Heath (MacKay), who joined the army from school. William's despair is contrasted with the irrepressible humour of veteran Wynn Bowen (Brydon), who offers a constant stream of irreverent comments from his bed. Guttman hits on competitive exercise and sport as a way of both encouraging physical exercise and building self-esteem. Now in wheelchairs, the patients compete at hockey and basketball, and begin to re-connect to the outside world. The patients visit a local pub and challenge the regulars to arm-wrestling. The previously suicidal William engages in sport so enthusiastically that he breaks a leg, to the consternation of the other medical staff. Wynn is scheduled for a reunion with his wife in Wales, although this makes his composure crack over worries about his sexual performance. After Dr Guttman tells him \\"there is more than one way to skin a cat\\", he returns, jubilantly proclaiming that he \\"skinned the cat!\\". Guttmann organises a national disability sport competition, the first Stoke Mandeville Games, in the hospital grounds. The film closes with captions describing how these developed into the Paralympics, and how Dr Guttmann was awarded a knighthood.

Registration A common carrier desiring to offer passenger transportation for hire within the \\"Metropolitan District\\" must register with the commission and obtain a WMATC number. This includes public bus systems owned by cities and counties within the region if managed and operated by a private company. Carriers directly operated by a state, or a municipality within the region are exempt from registration. Carriers operating exclusively within Virginia are exempt from registration with WMATC as they would register with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. Jurisdiction of the Commission, http://www.wmatc.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=58&Itemid;=27 (Retrieved 2013-04-18.) Taxicab companies that operate vehicles carrying 9 or fewer passengers (including the driver) are also exempt from registration with WMATC. Being authorized by the commission and issued a WMATC number to operate vehicles(s) means the organization does not have to register as a common carrier with the U.S. Department of Transportation if they operate exclusively within the Metropolitan District. Depending on the type of service, it may or may not have to also register with the District of Columbia Department of For- Hire Vehicles, the Virginia State Corporation Commission, and/or the Maryland Public Service Commission. WMATC serves as a single registration point for passenger common carriers operating within the \\"Metropolitan District,\\" consisting of the District of Columbia; the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church, Arlington County and Fairfax County and the political subdivisions located within those counties, and that portion of Loudoun County occupied by Dulles International Airport; and Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties in Maryland and political subdivisions located within those counties. Requirements The general requirement to obtain a WMATC number is similar to the U.S. Department of Transportation's requirement to obtain a DOT number, or most state Public Utilities Commissions to obtain a state registration number: submit a set of tariffs stating prices for services, pay a fee of about $500, and provide evidence of either a minimum of $1.5 million in insurance for carriers operating vehicles having 15 passengers or less (including the driver), or at least $5 million in insurance for carriers operating vehicles which can carry more than 15 persons. As with any other registration system, the carrier posts their number on the outside of their vehicles in the form \\"WMATC 126\\". WMATC should not be confused with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) which is the bus and train operator for the City of Washington and suburbs. WMATA is also exempt from regulation by WMATC.

Position space (also real space or coordinate space) is the set of all position vectors r in space, and has dimensions of length. A position vector defines a point in space. If the position vector of a point particle varies with time it will trace out a path, the trajectory of a particle. Momentum space is the set of all momentum vectors p a physical system can have. The momentum vector of a particle corresponds to its motion, with units of [mass][length][time]−1. Mathematically, the duality between position and momentum is an example of Pontryagin duality. In particular, if a function is given in position space, f(r), then its Fourier transform obtains the function in momentum space, φ(p). Conversely, the inverse transform of a momentum space function is a position space function. These quantities and ideas transcend all of classical and quantum physics, and a physical system can be described using either the positions of the constituent particles, or their momenta, both formulations equivalently provide the same information about the system in consideration. Another quantity is useful to define in the context of waves. The wave vector k (or simply \\"k-vector\\") has dimensions of reciprocal length, making it an analogue of angular frequency ω which has dimensions of reciprocal time. The set of all wave vectors is k-space. Usually r is more intuitive and simpler than k, though the converse can also be true, such as in solid-state physics. Quantum mechanics provides two fundamental examples of the duality between position and momentum, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2 stating that position and momentum cannot be simultaneously known to arbitrary precision, and the de Broglie relation p = ħk which states the momentum and wavevector of a free particle are proportional to each other. In this context, when it is unambiguous, the terms \\"momentum\\" and \\"wavevector\\" are used interchangeably. However, the de Broglie relation is not true in a crystal.  Position and momentum spaces in classical mechanics  = Lagrangian mechanics = Most often in Lagrangian mechanics, the Lagrangian L(q, dq/dt, t) is in configuration space, where q = (q1, q2,..., qn) is an n-tuple of the generalized coordinates. The Euler–Lagrange equations of motion are :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_i} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q_i} \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\dot{q}_i \\\\equiv \\\\frac{dq_i}{dt}\\\\,. (One overdot indicates one time derivative). Introducing the definition of canonical momentum for each generalized coordinate : p_i = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_i} \\\\,, the Euler–Lagrange equations take the form :\\\\dot{p}_i = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial q_i} \\\\,. The Lagrangian can be expressed in momentum space also, p.190 L′(p, dp/dt, t), where p = (p1, p2,..., pn) is an n-tuple of the generalized momenta. A Legendre transformation is performed to change the variables in the total differential of the generalized coordinate space Lagrangian; :dL = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial L }{\\\\partial q_i}dq_i + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L }{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}_i}d\\\\dot{q}_i\\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L }{\\\\partial t}dt = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\\\dot{p}_i dq_i + p_i d\\\\dot{q}_i ) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L }{\\\\partial t}dt \\\\,, where the definition of generalized momentum and Euler–Lagrange equations have replaced the partial derivatives of L. The product rule for differentialsFor two functions and , the differential of the product is . allows the exchange of differentials in the generalized coordinates and velocities for the differentials in generalized momenta and their time derivatives, :\\\\dot{p}_i dq_i = d(q_i\\\\dot{p}_i) - q_i d\\\\dot{p}_i : p_i d\\\\dot{q}_i = d(\\\\dot{q}_i p_i) - \\\\dot{q}_i d p_i which after substitution simplifies and rearranges to : d\\\\left[L - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n(q_i\\\\dot{p}_i + \\\\dot{q}_i p_i)\\\\right] = -\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\\\dot{q}_i d p_i + q_i d\\\\dot{p}_i ) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L }{\\\\partial t}dt \\\\,. Now, the total differential of the momentum space Lagrangian L′ is :dL' = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial L'}{\\\\partial p_i}dp_i + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L'}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{p}_i}d\\\\dot{p}_i\\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial L' }{\\\\partial t}dt so by comparison of differentials of the Lagrangians, the momenta, and their time derivatives, the momentum space Lagrangian L′ and the generalized coordinates derived from L′ are respectively :L' = L - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n(q_i\\\\dot{p}_i + \\\\dot{q}_i p_i)\\\\,,\\\\quad -\\\\dot{q}_i = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L'}{\\\\partial p_i}\\\\,,\\\\quad -q_i = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L'}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{p}_i} \\\\,. Combining the last two equations gives the momentum space Euler–Lagrange equations :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial L'}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{p}_i} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L'}{\\\\partial p_i} \\\\,. The advantage of the Legendre transformation is that the relation between the new and old functions and their variables are obtained in the process. Both the coordinate and momentum forms of the equation are equivalent and contain the same information about the dynamics of the system. This form may be more useful when momentum or angular momentum enters the Lagrangian. = Hamiltonian mechanics = In Hamiltonian mechanics, unlike Lagrangian mechanics which uses either all the coordinates or the momenta, the Hamiltonian equations of motion place coordinates and momenta on equal footing. For a system with Hamiltonian H(q, p, t), the equations are : \\\\dot{q}_i = \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial p_i} \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\dot{p}_i = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial q_i} \\\\,.  Position and momentum spaces in quantum mechanics  In quantum mechanics, a particle is described by a quantum state. This quantum state can be represented as a superposition (i.e. a linear combination as a weighted sum) of basis states. In principle one is free to choose the set of basis states, as long as they span the space. If one chooses the eigenfunctions of the position operator as a set of basis functions, one speaks of a state as a wave function \\\\psi(r) in position space (our ordinary notion of space in terms of length). The familiar Schrödinger equation in terms of the position r is an example of quantum mechanics in the position representation. By choosing the eigenfunctions of a different operator as a set of basis functions, one can arrive at a number of different representations of the same state. If one picks the eigenfunctions of the momentum operator as a set of basis functions, the resulting wave function \\\\phi(k) is said to be the wave function in momentum space. A feature of quantum mechanics is that phase spaces can come in different types: discrete- variable, rotor, and continuous-variable. The table below summarizes some relations involved in the three types of phase spaces. Comparison and summary of relations between conjugate variables in discrete-variable (DV), rotor (ROT), and continuous-variable (CV) phase spaces (taken from arXiv:1709.04460). Most physically relevant phase spaces consist of combinations of these three. Each phase space consists of position and momentum, whose possible values are taken from a locally compact Abelian group and its dual. A quantum mechanical state can be fully represented in terms of either variables, and the transformation used to go between position and momentum spaces is, in each of the three cases, a variant of the Fourier transform. The table uses bra-ket notation as well as mathematical terminology describing Canonical commutation relations (CCR).  Relation between space and reciprocal space  The momentum representation of a wave function is very closely related to the Fourier transform and the concept of frequency domain. Since a quantum mechanical particle has a frequency proportional to the momentum (de Broglie's equation given above), describing the particle as a sum of its momentum components is equivalent to describing it as a sum of frequency components (i.e. a Fourier transform). This becomes clear when we ask ourselves how we can transform from one representation to another. = Functions and operators in position space = Suppose we have a three- dimensional wave function in position space \\\\psi(r), then we can write this functions as a weighted sum of orthogonal basis functions \\\\psij(r): :\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})=\\\\sum_j \\\\phi_j \\\\psi_j(\\\\mathbf{r}) or, in the continuous case, as an integral :\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{k}{\\\\rm-space}} \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{k}) \\\\psi_{\\\\mathbf{k}}(\\\\mathbf{r}) {\\\\rm d}^3\\\\mathbf{k} It is clear that if we specify the set of functions \\\\psi_{\\\\mathbf{k}}(\\\\mathbf{r}), say as the set of eigenfunctions of the momentum operator, the function \\\\phi(k) holds all the information necessary to reconstruct \\\\psi(r) and is therefore an alternative description for the state \\\\psi. In quantum mechanics, the momentum operator is given by :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat p} = -i \\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r}} (see matrix calculus for the denominator notation) with appropriate domain. The eigenfunctions are :\\\\psi_{\\\\mathbf{k}}(\\\\mathbf{r})=\\\\frac{1}{(\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi})^3} e^{i \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}} and eigenvalues ħk. So :\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})=\\\\frac{1}{(\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi})^3} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{k}{\\\\rm-space}} \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}} {\\\\rm d}^3\\\\mathbf{k} and we see that the momentum representation is related to the position representation by a Fourier transform. = Functions and operators in momentum space = Conversely, a three-dimensional wave function in momentum space \\\\phi(k) as a weighted sum of orthogonal basis functions \\\\phij(k): :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\sum_j \\\\psi_j \\\\phi_j(\\\\mathbf{k}) or as an integral: :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{r}{\\\\rm-space}} \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\phi_{\\\\mathbf{r}}(\\\\mathbf{k}) {\\\\rm d}^3\\\\mathbf{r} the position operator is given by :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat r} = i \\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf p} = i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{k}} with eigenfunctions :\\\\phi_{\\\\mathbf{r}}(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\frac{1}{(\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi})^3} e^{-i \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}} and eigenvalues r. So a similar decomposition of \\\\phi(k) can be made in terms of the eigenfunctions of this operator, which turns out to be the inverse Fourier transform: :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\frac{1}{(\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi})^3} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{r}{\\\\rm-space}} \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) e^{-i \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}} {\\\\rm d}^3\\\\mathbf{r}  Unitary equivalence between position and momentum operator  The r and p operators are unitarily equivalent, with the unitary operator being given explicitly by the Fourier transform. Thus they have the same spectrum. In physical language, p acting on momentum space wave functions is the same as r acting on position space wave functions (under the image of the Fourier transform).  Reciprocal space and crystals  For an electron (or other particle) in a crystal, its value of k relates almost always to its crystal momentum, not its normal momentum. Therefore, k and p are not simply proportional but play different roles. See k·p perturbation theory for an example. Crystal momentum is like a wave envelope that describes how the wave varies from one unit cell to the next, but does not give any information about how the wave varies within each unit cell. When k relates to crystal momentum instead of true momentum, the concept of k-space is still meaningful and extremely useful, but it differs in several ways from the non-crystal k-space discussed above. For example, in a crystal's k-space, there is an infinite set of points called the reciprocal lattice which are \\"equivalent\\" to k = 0 (this is analogous to aliasing). Likewise, the \\"first Brillouin zone\\" is a finite volume of k-space, such that every possible k is \\"equivalent\\" to exactly one point in this region. For more details see reciprocal lattice.

It developed after a wooden toll bridge was built across the Powder River in 1877, at a site that was originally used as a ford. With crossing secured, a settlement developed here in the late 19th century, incorporating a stage stop on the Bozeman Trail. The site is notable for having well-preserved wagon ruts from the pioneer era. Cantonment Reno Powder River Crossing was a civilian settlement that grew up on the Bozeman Trail, across the Powder River from Cantonment Reno. Cantonment Reno was established in late 1876, three miles upstream from the site of Fort Reno, a fort that was established in 1865 and abandoned in 1868 under the terms of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. By 1878, Cantonment Reno was experiencing a shortage of lumber, forage and water.WyoHistory.org, A project of the Wyoming State Historical Society, Section on \\"Cantonment Reno\\" The army decided to relocate the fort to Fort McKinney, about 45 miles northwest near the present- day site of Buffalo, Wyoming.Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office, National Register of Historic Places, Fort McKinney By the end of 1878, all the soldiers were gone except for a smail detail who looked after the abandoned buildings and ran the telegraph station. Stage Stop The army built a military road and telegraph line along the Bozeman Trail in 1877 and 1878. Soldiers from Cantonment Reno completed a wooden bridge at the Powder River Crossing on April 6, 1877. In April 1979, the Patrick Brothers Stage Line began thrice weekly regular service between Fort Fetterman and Etchetah, Montana on the Bozeman Trail. Powder River Crossing was the fifth stage stop after Fort Fetterman. On May 13, 1879, the army allowed the old sutler's store and one of the cavalry stables from Cantonment Reno to be used as a store and eating house at Powder River Crossing. An English traveler stayed at the store on August 30, 1880, and left a description: \\"This is a deserted Fort....The log huts, built in a large square, are still standing. Frewen's store is in one of them, and there are two or three bedrooms there, rather rough and ready, one of which I secured....I was very tired towards night, and turned in early-no sheets-only a pair of blankets to get between, but I was soon asleep notwithstanding.\\" In January 1880, the Rock Creek Stage Company moved another log cavalry stable from the old cantonment to a point east of the Powder River along the Dry Fork. They also built several other buildings including a new stage stop. The stage station was eventually made up of a large, long building (store, saloon, and living quarters in one) along with stables, a blacksmith shop, and numerous old dugout cabins. The amenities included fresh horses, tobacco, whiskey, and prostitutes. From 1882 to 1891, William P. Hathaway ran the store and saloon which was located directly east of the dry gulch at the end of the little patch of timber.\\" Amanda and Horace Brown ran the stage stop at Powder River Crossing from 1884 until 1887. Her memoirs appeared in the October 1958 issue of Colorado Magazine: \\"We made good money, but I sure worked myself down. I cooked for all the way from ten to forty people, did all my washing, cleaned the rooms, and waited on people. We kept the stage people. I always had to be ready for a stage full, and sometimes it was only the drivers. There were all the different people which make up a new country traveling on the road - ranchmen, cowboys, gamblers, horse thieves, and occasionally stage robbers.\\" According to Brown, a small community grew up around the stage station, and the iron bridge that was built in 1883. There were never more than four families at Powder River Crossing, but the amenities includes a store, a post office, and a saloon. When the Burlington Railroad reached Clearmont, Wyoming in 1892, the stage line was no longer needed. Abandonment The post office at Powder River was established on May 22, 1879 with John Livingston as the first postmaster. In 1881, Henry Winter (\\"Hard Winter\\") Davis, established the Spectacle Ranch near the present site of Sussex, Wyoming. The post office at Powder River Crossing moved to the Davis ranch on October 18, 1895. The road that ran down the Dry Fork was rerouted to cross the Powder River at Sussex, and it eventually became Wyoming Highway 192. In 1914, a new bridge and post office were built at Sussex (Sussex Post Office and Store), and this spelled the end of Powder River Crossing. Present Status The area at Powder River Crossing was never homesteaded, and it is owned by the Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments, an agency of the State of Wyoming. There is a wide dispersal of wagon ruts from the Bozeman Trail near the mouth of the Dry Fork tributary. Near the ruts, marked by a grove of cottonwood trees, is the former location of the Powder River Station and the eating establishment run by Horace Brown.

Voters were asked whether they approve of two amendments to the constitution; one to eliminate the absolute right to bail and the other to decrease the number of members of the Legislative Assembly.Referendum 2012 CEEPUR Despite support from the party in government and part of the main opposition party, both amendments were rejected by voters. Background On January 9, 2012, Puerto Rican Governor Luis Fortuño signed the project for a Legislative Reform that would reduce the number of legislators. According to Fortuño, this would result in a decrease in the expenses associated with the operation of the Legislative Assembly. To achieve this, the constitution has to be amended, which would require a referendum to the people. On May 10, 2012, the Senate approved a resolution that proposed another amendment to the Constitution, this time to eliminate the absolute right to bail, specifically in murder cases, and others. Governor Fortuño signed the resolution on May 15, agreeing to hold the referendum for both constitutional amendments on August 19, 2012. Former Governors Rafael Hernández Colón, Carlos Romero Barceló, and Pedro Rosselló, had tried unsuccessfully to eliminate the absolute right for bail during their tenures. Rosselló was the only one to hold a referendum in 1994, but people voted against the amendment. Proposed amendments =Article III= The first amendment applies to Article III, Sections 2, 3, 4, and 7. It proposes to reduce the members of the Legislative Assembly from 78 to 56. Specifically: *the number of senators would be reduced from 27 to 17 (11 district senators and 6 at-large) *the number of representatives would be reduced from 51 to 39 (33 district representatives and 6 at-large) This would require increasing the number of senatorial districts from 8 to 11, while reducing the representative districts from 40 to 33. =Article II= The second amendment applies to Article II, Sections 11. It proposes to eliminate the absolute right to bail, specifically in cases of those accused of: *premeditated murder *murder during a home invasion *murder during a kidnapping or sexual aggression *murder while shooting a firearm from a motor vehicle or in a public place *murdering a police officer while on duty In those cases, the judge will have the discretion of conceding or denying bail, after evaluating if the accused represents a risk to others or to the case. Voting process Both proposed amendments were presented to the voters in a ballot, with two questions. Each question asked if they approved the proposed amendment, to which the voters answered in a \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" checkbox to each question. Each ballot also presented the proposed amendment as it would have been featured in the Constitution of Puerto Rico, if it had won. The ballot format was criticized by various groups, who considered it \\"difficult to read\\", according to José Acarón, state director of the AARP. Roberto Aponte, electoral commissioner for the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) also stated that the ballot would be \\"troublesome to read\\". Ramón Jiménez, director of the referendum scrutiny, assured that the ballot was readable, but also said that voting colleges would have enlarged ballots for anyone who needed them. Prisons in Puerto Rico held the voting process for the referendum on August 17, 2012 with approximately 8,350 of 11,800 prisoners participating. Former Speaker of the Puerto Rican House of Representatives and convict Edison Misla Aldarondo voted in a Bayamón prison. He said to a newspaper that he voted in favor of eliminating the absolute right for bail because \\"it is a mechanism to deal with the crime situation.\\" However, he voted against the proposed Legislative Reform saying that \\"quality and quantity are two different things\\". On August 19, 2012, 3,151 voting colleges opened at 8:00am and closed at 3:00pm. Campaign =Opponents= Reaction to the proposed amendments was mixed, with several groups deciding to campaign against them answering \\"No\\" to each question. A coalition group called Frente Amplio de Puerto Rico: Mesa Amplia de Diálogo decided to campaign against both amendments and declared August 17, 2012 to be the \\"Day of No and No\\". The group is formed by new parties Movimiento Unión Soberanista (MUS), Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party (PPR), and the Worker's People Party of Puerto Rico (PPT), along with groups like the Alianza Pro Libre Asociación Soberana (ALAS), Church's Council, and the Ecumenic Coalition. The Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) is campaigning against both amendments, arguing that the proposed Legislative Reform would \\"crush minorities\\" by increasing the number of votes that minority candidates would need to be elected. Several weeks before the referendum, they also argued that there was still confusion among the voters, and that electoral participation will be around 20%. Héctor Pesquera, co-president of the Hostosian National Independence Movement (MINH) asked people to vote against the amendments arguing that eliminating the absolute right to bail won't be a solution to the rising crime rate in the island. The members of the Ateneo Puertorriqueño, one of the main cultural institutions of the island, also wrote a statement against the amendments calling them an \\"attempt on people's rights\\". Various leaders within the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) campaigned against the amendments. Former Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá posted a video on his blog in which he asked people to vote \\"No\\". The former President of the Senate, Miguel Hernández Agosto, and former gubernatorial candidate, Victoria Muñoz Mendoza, also stated their opposition to the amendments. Current candidates Rafael Cox Alomar, Eduardo Bhatia and Carmen Yulín Cruz also said they were against the amendments, despite the position of the president of the party and current gubernatorial candidate Alejandro García Padilla to vote in favor. Human rights activist Pedro Julio Serrano expressed himself against the amendments, arguing that the problem wasn't the bail, but rather that \\"7 out of 10 cases are solved\\". He also offered statistics from the Legal Assistance Association that showed that, out of 100 persons accused of murder during a year, only eight received the benefit of freedom while awaiting their trial. The Puerto Rico Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (PRACDL) also expressed themselves against the amendments. In their statement, they argued that \\"preventive detention hasn't contributed to make Puerto Rico, or United States, a safer place for their citizens, nor does it contribute to a culture of respect to the rights of others.\\" In August 2012, Puerto Rican singer/actor Ricky Martin posted on his website \\"To amend the Constitution goes beyond party ideologies. Don't let fear and frustration decide your vote. The rights we already have shouldn't be relinquished.\\" René Pérez, from Calle 13, also invited people to vote \\"No\\" to the amendments. Pérez wrote on his Facebook page \\"You wouldn't amputate an arm or a leg, unless it was to save your life. The same happens with freedom. The right for bail is part of it. You shouldn't vote to have a part of you amputated. Think. If one day you're wrongly accused, you should have the right to be free while you wait to prove it\\" and added \\"Limit the weapons, not our rights.\\" A group of artists under the name of Artistas en Defensa al Derecho a la Fianza also made statements against the proposed amendments to the Constitution. The group, led by actor Luis Enrique Romero, included artists from several branches like actresses Ineabelle Colón, Amneris Morales, Magali Carrasquillo, and Anamín Santiago; folk singers José Antonio \\"Tony Mapeyé\\" Rivera and Eduardo Villanueva; singers/musicians Irvin García and Pepe Sánchez; painter Pablo Marcano, and photographer Félix Guayciba. During a press conference, actress Amneris Morales called the current government \\"a dictatorship\\", while fellow actress Carrasquillo argued that \\"not everybody will be accused with the same severity\\". The parents of Karla Michelle Negrón, a 15-year-old girl that was killed by a stray bullet during New Year's Eve, said they would vote against the amendments, stating that it \\"simplifies a bigger problem\\" and that it \\"won't help fight against crime\\". =Proponents= Governor Luis Fortuño and his party, New Progressive Party (PNP), campaigned in favor of the proposed amendments. Most of the leaders of the party support him and will campaign with him. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, asked voters to participate of the referendum and encouraged them to vote in favor of the amendments. Also, a group of chiefs of agencies made statements in favor of the amendments. The group, led by Chief of Staff Miguel Romero, included Guillermo Somoza (Justice), Yanitzia Irizarry (Family), Miguel Hernández Vivoni (Housing), Jesús F. Méndez (Treasury), Henry Neumann (Sports and Recreation), and Jesús González (Correction). Alejandro García Padilla, current senator and gubernatorial candidate for the opposing Popular Democratic Party (PPD), also expressed he would vote in favor of the amendments. His posture came as a surprise, since he voted against the resolution in the Senate of Puerto Rico. He said that \\"with the referendum already approved and in the absence of other legislative mechanisms like the ones we have proposed during this term to fight against crime, I express myself in favor of this amendment and I will vote accordingly.\\" Former governors Sila María Calderón and Rafael Hernández Colón expressed themselves in favor of the amendments, along with other members of the party like Sila María González Calderón, Luis Raúl Torres Cruz, Jorge Colberg Toro, and others. A group of judges, including Efraín Rivera Pérez, a former judge of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and Héctor Laffitte, former federal judge, expressed themselves in favor of the amendments. Also, former two-time Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department, Pedro Toledo, expressed himself in favor of the amendments. He added that some guidelines could be needed to allow judges to define the issue of the dangerousness of the accused. Astrologer Walter Mercado said on a statement that he favored both amendments to the Constitution. He wrote that he considered the amendment on the right to bail to be an important tool on the fight against crime, and that it was \\"a step ahead in the control of the rising crime rate.\\" He added that the amendment would \\"protect good and decent people from criminals that used their time on bail to threaten witnesses and commit more crimes.\\" =Advertisements= The New Progressive Party (PNP) published advertisements in favor of the amendments using the pictures of two young men recently accused of murder. The pictures, taken after their arrests, show both men with their middle fingers to the camera. The advertisement reads \\"If you don't vote, they win\\". The mother of one of the men in the picture, Vilmarie Carrasquillo, presented a preliminary injunction to withdraw the advertisement, arguing that his son's right for privacy was violated. However, the San Juan Court determined that the PNP could continue using the advertisement. Two days before the referendum, the Supreme Court ratified the decision of the Court of San Juan allowing the PNP to continue with their campaign. Opinion polls A poll by local newspaper El Nuevo Día was published on August 12, 2012. The poll had the following results: * 59% support the elimination of the absolute right for bail, against a 27% opposition. 14% was still undecided. * 76% support the decrease in the number of legislators, against a 13% opposition. 11% was still undecided. The poll, which was designed and analyzed by Kaagan Research Associates, included a sample of 1,000 people and could produce an error of ±3%. Results The first preliminary results were announced by the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico at around 4:00. At around 6:25pm, Luis Fortuño's campaign director Angel Cintrón announced that there was a tendency against the amendments in the results so far. During a press conference, he said \\"It's not what we expected, it's different to our projections, and we have to accept it.\\" However, he added that the results weren't definitive yet since there were still more than 50% of votes to count. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, also acknowledged the defeat saying that the amendments his party had proposed \\"weren't accepted and that people don't want to amend the Constitution\\". He added that there could have been some misinformation in the process. The results on the absolute bail bill means that \\"Puerto Rico remains the only place in the Western Hemisphere where everyone is entitled to bail regardless of the alleged crime.\\"Puerto Ricans Reject Constitutional Amendments. Danica Coto (Associated Press). 19 August 2012 ABC News. Retrieved 20 August 2012. The final results, according to the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico, were:Resultados Referendum 2012 on CEEPUR Aftermath At 7:00pm, Governor Luis Fortuño held a press conference, along with Pedro Pierluisi, where he conceded the defeat of the \\"Yes\\" camp. In his message, he said that \\"this isn't about one party or one government\\" and assured those that supported him that they would keep on working \\"outside of party lines, so that everyone can be part of the solution\\". On the other hand, Senator and PPD gubernatorial candidate Alejandro García Padilla blamed Fortuño and Pierluisi for the loss during a press conference. At the Puerto Rico Bar Association, groups that were against the amendments started celebrating the preliminary results. Former Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá celebrated the victory saying that \\"reason triumphed over fear and money\\". The PIP gubernatorial candidate Juan Dalmau Ramírez said that the defeat represented a \\"moral defeat\\" for both Fortuño and García Padilla.

Nicknamed 'the chairman,' Simwala featured for Zambia and Rhokana United (later Nkana Red Devils and now Nkana F.C.) as a right winger, the same club he would go on to coach for over 12 years and become the most successful coach in Zambian club football, winning the league title a record 8 times and 21 trophies in all. He was voted Zambian coach of the year in 1988 and 1989. Early life Simwala was born Moses Jimwala in Kitwe to Katontoka and Belita Jimwala who originated from the North-Western Province of Zambia and settled in the Copperbelt town of Kalulushi, after which the family name changed to Simwala. He was the third born of six sons and three daughters and played with home-made footballs with his friends at Twibukishe open grounds. He went to Wusaklie Primary School in 1959 and later moved to Nkana Primary School from where he was selected to Luanshimba Secondary School in 1966. His favourite subjects were chemistry and health sciences and he completed his secondary school education in 1970.Lombe, Christopher. \\"Simwala: A pure Nkana breed” Zambia Daily Mail, 16 April 1993, p.12 Playing career Simwala started playing football for the school team at Luanshimba in 1966, the same year in which he joined Rhokana United. He was encouraged by the support from teammates Freddie Mwila, Stone Chibwe and Henry Kalimukwa who gave him advice and guidance in football. The following year, he was selected to represent Zambia schools alongside players like George Mungwa, Peter M'hango, Richard Stephenson, Gibby Zulu, Edward Musonda, Emmanuel Mwape, Willie Phiri, Poni 'Express' Muyambango and Ackim Musenge. Simwala was a skilful right winger with pace to burn and in his time at Rokana, he won the Challenge Cup in 1966 and the Heinrich (Chibuku) Cup in 1969, providing the cross for Eric Chekeloko's winner in a 1–0 victory over Mufulira Wanderers in Ndola. Playing alongside Zambian international stars Bernard Chanda and Brighton Sinyangwe, he won the Heinrich (Chibuku) Cup again in 1974. In October 1977, Chanda was suspended by the club for disciplinary reasons and Simwala replaced him as club captain.Anon.\\"Simwala promoted\\" Times of Zambia, 11 October 1977 p.8 In December 1980, he decided to call time on his playing career and took up coaching.Kamphodza, Sam. \\"Simwala quits\\" Times of Zambia, 19 December 1980 p.8 National team Simwala first featured for the Zambian national team in October 1969 against Congolese club Daring Falcons in a three match series for the BAT Independence trophy, while he was still a schoolboy. His full international debut came a year later in a CAN qualifier against Tanzania in Dar es Salaam. His first goal for Zambia was in April 1973 when Zambia beat Ethiopia 4–2 in a World Cup qualifier in Lusaka. Six months later, Simwala was on the score sheet again when Zambia beat Morocco 4–0 in another World Cup qualifier in Lusaka, a match which he rated as one of his most memorable games. He was a squad member at CAN 1974 where Zambia reached the final only to lose to Zaire after a replay. When Dick Chama retired, Simwala was named captain and he led Zambia to the 1976 East and Central Africa football tournament where they lost the final 2–0 to Uganda. He was part of Zambia's Olympic Games squad at Moscow 1980 and played all three games as Zambia bowed out in the first round. His last game for Zambia came on 12 December 1980 in a 1–1 draw with Kenya during that country's Independence celebrations after which he announced his retirement from football to leave room to young players and took up the coaching job at Rhokana stadium. Coaching career In 1980, Simwala was appointed Rhokana United (who were by then renamed Nkana Red Devils) coach under Englishman Jeff Butler. His first success was the 1982 Zambian league title when Nkana finished the season unbeaten in 22 league games. It was the first time the Red Devils had won the league and it would be the first of 8 titles under Simwala. The Devils retained the title the following year and lost it in 1984 to bitter Kitwe rivals Power Dynamos but made up the following year. With 4 games to go, Simwala was sidelined and replaced by Butler as coach for the remaining 4 league games, after a poor run by the devils and the team responded by beating Power 2–0 at their home ground in the last game of the season and snatched the title by a point.Anon. \\"Butler back at Devils\\" Times of Zambia, 7 November 1985 p.12Anon. \\"Devils win FAZ league,\\" Sunday Times of Zambia, 8 December 1985 p.8 Simwala bounced back the following season and led Nkana to the 1986 title once again and though Nkana had done well in the league under Simwala, they had had a dismal run in cup competitions. This changed in 1986 when they won the Zambian Cup for the first time ever, beating record cup holders Mufulira Wanderers 3–0. This was also Nkana's first cup success since 1969 and they added the Champion of Champions cup later that year. Simwala was rewarded with a coach of the year nomination but lost out to Roy Mulenga of Division I side ZESCO United, who uttered some unfavourable comments about Simwala when fans questioned his credentials for winning the award. Nkana followed this up with another league title in 1988 and completely cast aside any doubts as to whether they were the dominant team in Zambian soccer. Also known as the 'Clampers,' playing Nkana at their home ground Nkana Stadium was a daunting undertaking and few teams came away with anything. That year's league title was even more impressive considering that seven senior players were suspended for a reasonable part of the season for refusing to sing the national anthem after losing the Heroes and Unity Cup to Green Buffaloes in a final which was played at Nkana Stadium. They would go on to win the league in 1989 and 1990 and also represented Zambia in continental competitions, often reaching the Africa Club Champions Cup quarter-finals and semi-finals. In 1990, Simwala attended a 3-month coaching course in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where he had the opportunity of meeting Pele who lectured the attendees and gave them tips. Later that year, he scored another achievement when he led Nkana to the final of the Africa Club Champions Cup against JS Kabylie of Algeria. After a slender 1–0 defeat in the first leg, Nkana reversed the score line in Lusaka and the game went to penalties. Mordon Malitoli's miss denied Nkana the coveted trophy. In 1992, Simwala was appointed assistant national team coach to Samuel \\"Zoom\\" Ndhlovu.Anon. \\"Figge lands top trainer's job\\" Times of Zambia, 20 June 1992, p.10 For such a highly successful coach, it was just a matter of time before he was given the opportunity to coach the national team. Simwala was picked to replace Ndhlovu as interim Zambian coach after Zambia lost a World Cup qualifier in Madagascar in December 1992, with Godfrey Chitalu and Alex Chola as his assistants. However, he could not take up the appointment due to sickness and Chitalu became the national coach. This also affected his position at Nkana where he was made Technical Advisor and Ben Bamfuchile took over as coach. Controversies Simwala's glory days were not without controversy. In 1981, Rokana came close to their first ever league title and were level on points with Green Buffaloes going into the last game of the season. Buffaloes had won their last league match against 'sister club' Ndola United by a score of 6–0, leaving Rokana with the unenviable task of beating Power Dynamos by 10 goals.Chola, Gunston and Katulushi, Lennie. \\"Rokana brace for the impossible\\" Times of Zambia, 9 December 1981, p.10 They could only manage a 3–1 win and missed out on their first title on goal difference after both teams tied on 48 points. After the Buffaloes win, Simwala alleged that the match had been fixed as there was no way Ndola could lose by such a wide margin. No action was taken against Simwala though Rokana management disassociated themselves from the comments.Anon. \\"Games fixed, says Simwala\\" Times of Zambia, 8 December 1981, p.8 When Mulenga was selected ahead of Simwala by a panel of sports journalists for steering his team to the premier league from Division I he controversially aimed a barb in Simwala's direction when it was suggested that the Nkana trainer would have been a more deserving winner, saying Simwala was assisted in his job by Butler, \\"I am not a man who is assisted in his job by other people. Therefore it is not a true reflection of his ability as a coach because ZCCM (Nkana's sponsors) puts a black man in front of a white man as a trainer of Nkana Red Devils.\\"Anon. \\"I'm sorry, Mulenga tells Simwala\\" Times of Zambia, 13 January 1987, p.8 Simwala reacted angrily to the slight and accused Mulenga of being ignorant, \\"I work independently and my job is to get good results for Nkana. I don't work for (sponsors of the award) Rothmans or that bunch of amateurs who picked Mulenga. Mulenga should not try to downgrade me. I have been in this business for a long time. He should go fishing if he has nothing better to do. I am not interested in personal attacks. We should work together instead of criticizing each other.\\" The two buried the hatchet when Mulenga apologised, stating that he had not meant to hurt Simwala's feelings; \\"I am sorry for what I said and apologise most sincerely especially to Simwla and all the soccer fans. I appreciate that Simwala played more football than I did and is very good and popular. Even as a coach, he has been very successful.\\" When the two teams met in the league a few weeks later, Nkana pulverised ZESCO 4–0. That same year, Simwala had a coaching stint at Swansea in Wales for 6 weeks. In 1989, Simwala incensed the Referees Association of Zambia (RAZ) with his comments after a league game, when he remarked that his wife would have handled the game better than the referee who was in charge on the day. The RAZ gave a statement a few days later that henceforth, referees would boycott Nkana matches and Mrs. Simwala would officiate all of their games. The ban was enforced and Nkana matches had to be postponed until Simwala and the club apologised for the remarks. In June 1992, Simwala was again in the headlines and this time he was fined and suspended for the rest of the season for attacking referee Alex Kampinda after a league match against Chambishi Blackburn at Chambishi ground which Nkana won 2–0. Although Simwala denied punching the referee and insisted that he merely touched him in the process of gesticulating, the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) still found him culpable. Because the referee left the incident out of his match report, his appeal was successfully heard though the referee was carpeted for not reporting the incident.Kachingwe, Chris \\"FAZ court bans Simwala\\" Sunday Times of Zambia, 21 June 1992, p.10 Death Simwala first experienced poor health when he was appointed interim national team trainer in January 1993 but was hospitalised at Nkana Mine Hospital as the team went into camp in Kabwe.Anon. \\"Simwala sidelined as squad camps\\" Times of Zambia, 5 January 1993, p.16 On Tuesday 6 January, he was discharged from hospital with doctors advising him to rest for one week to recover but he decided to immediately join the national team although his wife Rhoda pleaded in vain for him to rest and join up the following day. Four days later, he was taken ill again and admitted to Kabwe General Hospital and ruled out of the squad travelling to Tanzania for a crucial World Cup encounter. Chitalu took over as coach and Zambia won the game 3–1.Mulwanda, Gerald. \\"Simwala shocker\\" Sunday Times of Zambia, 10 January 1993, p.8 Simwala spent more time in hospital in Kitwe, was discharged but readmitted after complaining of a persistent cough and general weakness. Nkana management then took the decision to appoint Ben Bamfuchile as coach until such a time when Simwala recovered fully and in the meantime, handed him the role of Technical Advisor. In September, Nkana travelled to Ghana to defend a one-goal lead against Asante Kotoko in the Africa Clubs Champions Cup quarter-final but lost 3–0. After the game, the players were informed that Simwala had died at Nkana Mine Hospital earlier in the afternoon.Anon. \\"Nkana in double tragedy\\" Times of Zambia, 20 September 1993, p.12 He was put to rest at Chamboli Cemetery in Kitwe and was survived by a wife and five children.

Jet Star was originally built in 1972 and located in Germany before being imported into the United States in 1976 into the hands of an independent operator near Astroland of Coney Island. Following the operator's financial troubles, the roller coaster was repossessed and sold to Knoebels Amusement Resort where it opened in 1977. The Jet Star operated at Knoebels until 1992, when it was sold and relocated to Morey's Piers in Wildwood, NJ. In its place, Whirlwind was added to Knoebels attraction lineup. Jet Star was eventually sold again to Luna Park La Palmyre in 1999 where it now operates, as Morey's Piers executed plans to replace it with RC-48.

Celestyn was the son of Mateusz Myślenta (also Myslonius) and Eufroza née Wiercinska. His father was once employed by Duke Radziwill and belonged to the Polish nobility. As a stipendiary of the duke of Prussia he studied at University Königsberg, then became Lutheran pastor in Kuty from 1581-1599., here p. 146. Celestyn studied Latin in Wegorzewo (Angerburg), Frydląd (Friedland in Prussia) and at the university of Königsberg. In 1609, he relocated to Wittenberg to study Protestant theology under Leonhard Hutter, Friedrich Balduin and Friedrich Meisner. In 1615, he spent some months in Leipzig and later moved to Gießen to study at the local university, where his disputation in Hebrew drew much attention. His knowledge of oriental languages was gained during his stay in Frankfurt under Christoph Helvig, Johannes Gisenius and in conversations with the Jews of Frankfurt, who introduced him to rabbinical literature. He continued his studies in Gießen and received his doctorate in 1619. During an educational journey he also visited the universities of Jena, Tübingen, Leiden, and Basel, where he broadened his knowledge of oriental languages under Johannes Buxtorf and Thomas van Erpe., here p. 674. In 1619, he was appointed by Prussian duke John Sigismund to the university of Königsberg as a professor extraordinarius of theology, and in 1621 as professor ordinarius of Hebrew.

Puskesmas Sumber in Cirebon, West Java Puskesmas (Indonesian: Pusat Kesehatan Masyarakat, English: Community Health Centre) are government-mandated community health clinics located across Indonesia. They are overseen by the Indonesian Ministry of Health and provide healthcare for population on sub- district level. The concept was designed by G.A. Siwabessy, the first Indonesian Minister of Health. Community and preventive health programs formed another component of Indonesia's health system. There is approximately 9718 Puskesmas around the country according to the Ministry of Health of Indonesia. Community health services in Indonesia were organized in a three-tier system with Puskesmas at the top. Usually staffed by a physician, these centres provided maternal and child health care, general outpatient curative and preventive health care services, pre- and postnatal care, immunization, and communicable disease control programs. Specialised clinic services were periodically available at some of the larger clinics. There are two kinds of Puskesmas, those with beds and those without one. The Puskesmas without beds generally acts as a public outpatient treatment facility, is rarely open after mid-day, and is definitely not likely to be either open or prepared to deal with an obstetric emergency outside of clinic hours. This centre is usually staffed by a Bidan (nurse) and a general practitioner who provide preventive and curative services related to 18 different health programmes including Antenatal care and family planning program. These Puskesmas however have been characterised as under-burdened and problematic as these health centre tend to bypass serious patient to higher level of health services. Should a critically ill patient appear at this type of facility, the staff are more likely to simply send the patient on to the next level of care than to attempt to administer first aid or try to prepare the patient for transfer. The Puskesmas with beds are mostly located in more remote areas and ideally should be staffed and equipped to provide Basic Emergency Obstetric Care/Pelayanan Obstetri Neonatus Essensial Dasar (BEOC/PONED) twenty-four hours per day. A Bidan and a GP, who are not always properly trained for BEOC/PONED, staff these centres. Those who have been trained are reluctant to attempt procedures such as manual removal of placenta when a case requiring this procedure presents to them very rarely. UNICEF has funded BEOC/PONED/LSS training of some Puskesmas staff in three provinces early in the life of the project. They also funded education for Puskesmas Bidans on the administration of the MCH (Maternal and Child Health Specialist) program and on how to supervise Bidan in various villages.

Many different strategies have been proposed as solutions for cartilage defects. Surgical techniques currently being studied include: * bone marrow stimulation * osteochondral autograft transplantation * osteochondral allograft transplantation * autologous chondrocyte implantation * cell-based (using chondrocytes or stem-cells) or acellular scaffolding Articular cartilage stem cell paste grafting is another technique in use and is undergoing continued investigation. Background Articular cartilage is a connective tissue overlying the ends of bones that provides smooth joint surfaces. Healthy cartilage is essential to the proper functioning of joints within the body. Cartilage is composed of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix of collagen fibers and proteoglycans. It contains no blood vessels therefore its cells are dependent upon diffusion for the supply of oxygen and nutrients. Its intrinsic healing capacity is low. Injury to cartilage can lead to pain and stiffness and is the precursor to the development of osteoarthritis (degenerative joint arthritis). History Articular cartilage stem cell paste grafting was initially described by Kevin R. Stone M.D., a San Francisco-based orthopedic surgeon, in 1997 . The technique was devised in response to reports that many of the contemporary cartilage restoration procedures lead to the development of fibrocartilage, not true hyaline articular cartilage. Knowing that fibrocartilage was not as durable as articular cartilage and that its formation yielded only short term clinical benefits, Stone proposed his paste grafting as a means of regenerating hyaline-like cartilage. The hypothesis was that harvesting a mixture of articular cartilage and cancellous bone would combine pluripotent cells of the cancellous bone with cartilage extracellular matrix and growth factors and when exposed to continuous motion, hyaline-like cartilage would be stimulated to form. Surgical Procedure Published descriptions of the articular cartilage stem cell paste grafting technique are readily available. The procedure is performed in an outpatient setting under general anesthesia. The surgical steps are summarized here: * The lesion is cleared of loose or fibrillated cartilage * The base of the lesion is penetrated with an arthroscopic awl it is entirely morselized * Tissue for grafting is harvested using a trephine that is impacted into the margin of the articular cartilage and underlying cancellous bone at the medial border of the lateral femoral condyle * The trephine is removed and the articular cartilage and cancellous bone is morselized in a graft impactor * The graft paste is re-loaded into the trephine and impacted into the fractured bed of the chondral defect * The paste graft is held in place for 1 to 2 minutes Postoperatively, patients are requested to use a continuous passive motion machine for 6 hours a night for 4 weeks. If the defect is in a weight-bearing region, weight-bearing is restricted for 4 weeks. A guided physical therapy program begins on postoperative day 1. Results In a 2 to 12 year follow-up of 125 patients, pain, functioning, and activity measures improved in 82% of patients. Eighteen of the 125 patients (14.4%) were considered failures. Histologically, 42 of 66 (63.6%) of biopsies showed strong evidence of replacement of their articular surface, and 18 of 66 biopsies (27.3%) showed development of normal looking hyaline cartilage. Advantages Paste grafting is a relatively simple surgical procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. It requires minimal special instrumentation. Unexpected lesions can be treated. No tissue culture or foreign matrices are required. Paste grafting has been an effective salvage procedure for failed microfracture, failed Osteochondral Autograph Transplant Surgery (OATS) or Mosaicplasty procedures, Carticel and TruFit procedures. Compared to the cost of other complex cartilage restoration procedures, the cost of paste grafting is minimal. Disadvantages include limited experience with patella paste grafting and it remains difficult to access the very far posterior lesions.

In 1939 Trondhjems mekaniske Værksted (TMV) of Trondheim, Norway launched Springfjord for Springwell Shipping Co, Ltd of London. Springwell created a separate company, Springfjord Shipping Co, Ltd, to actually own the ship. Springford was a conventional cargo steamer of her era, powered by a three- cylinder triple-expansion steam engine of TMV's own manufacture. Seized by Germany in the Second World War In April 1940, while Springfjord was still being fitted out in Trondheim, Germany invaded Norway. The German authorities had her completed for Deutsche Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft \\"Hansa\\" (DDG Hansa) of Bremen, who renamed her Rüdesheimer. In May 1945 German forces in Norway surrendered to the incoming British military occupation. Rüdesheimer was seized at Tønsberg and transferred to the British Ministry of War Transport. The MoWT added its standard \\"Empire\\" prefix to her original name, making her Empire Springfjord. In 1946 the MoWT was dissolved and in 1947 the ship was restored to Springwell Shipping Co Ltd, who reinstated the original version of her name Springfjord. Napalmed and sunk by the CIA In 1954 the CIA was engineering a coup d'état in Guatemala to replace its elected government with a dissident Guatemalan colonel, Carlos Castillo Armas. In May 1954 the Swedish cargo ship had evaded US sea and air patrols to deliver a cargo of Czechoslovak armaments to Puerto Barrios on Guatemala's Caribbean coast to augment the elected government's defences. The CIA was determined to prevent any further arms deliveries. This included using a covert \\"Liberation Air Force\\", disguised as rebels unconnected with the USA, that the CIA had created to support Colonel Castillo's few hundred rebels. Early on the morning of 27 June 1954, the day that the CIA coup forced Guatemala's elected President Jacobo Árbenz to resign and flee into exile, Springfjord was under charter to the US shipping company Grace Line and was at Puerto San José, Guatemala loading a mixed cargo that included coffee and 976 bales of cotton. Anastasio Somoza García pressured the CIA to attack Springfjord, which was done by the pilot Ferdinand Schoup on 27 June 1954. Schoup, flying a Lockheed P-38M Lightning heavy fighter aircraft with no markings, attacked Springfjord with napalm bombs and set her on fire. Springfjord was badly damaged, but on 29 June Lloyd's of London reported that she was still afloat. On 28 June the Guatemalan government told the British chargé d'affaires in Guatemala City that the aircraft belonged to the insurgents. Responsibility A Lockheed P-38M Lightning like the one with which Ferdinand Schoup dropped napalm bombs on Springfjord Entrance to the United Fruit Company's former New Orleans headquarters The US government had ordered the CIA coup partly because it opposed a Guatemalan decree to nationalize unused foreign-owned farmland. A CIA secret memorandum dated 1 July 1955 confirms that the pilot who attacked Springfjord was a US national and that the CIA field command ordered him to do so, but asserts that the field command did not have authorization from CIA Headquarters. The US United Fruit Company (UFC) owned 42% of Guatemala's agricultural land, and in the UK House of Commons some British Labour Party MPs implied that the UFC was behind the coup. A United Nations fact-finding committee had gone to Central America to investigate events in Guatemala, so on 5 July 1954 the Labour MP Philip Noel-Baker suggested that this committee should investigate whether the UFC had anything to do with obtaining the aircraft used to attack Springfjord. Noel-Baker's Labour colleague John Strachey MP suggested that the UK government should try questioning the UFC. During the same exchange in the Commons, other Labour MPs pursued the suspicion that the USA had orchestrated the coup. Geoffrey Bing MP asked the Conservative government's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Selwyn Lloyd, to ask the US government whether it sold the ammunition to the Guatemalan rebels. Lloyd retorted \\"the hon. and learned Gentleman, in assuming that the United States Government are responsible in some way for this, is, I believe, stating something which is wholly divorced from the truth.\\" George Wigg bluntly asked \\"Will the Minister be good enough to answer \\"Yes,\\" or \\"No,\\" to a simple question? Is it a fact that American aircraft, manned by American pilots, machine-gunned Guatemalan civilians and dropped napalm bombs on Guatemala, and that Her Majesty's Government were well aware of that fact?\\" Lloyd insisted \\"That is certainly not the case. Her Majesty's Government have no information of that kind whatsoever.\\" On 20 October 1954 the Labour MP Leslie Plummer alleged in the House of Commons that the British Consul at Puerto San José told Springfjords Master, Captain Bradford, to keep silent about the sinking of his ship and took from him a set of photographs of the incident taken by a member of Springfjords crew. The Conservative Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Robin Turton, replied claiming that the British Embassy in Guatemala City had merely asked Bradford \\"in view of the political situation in Guatemala, to inform them of any statement that he might be making to the Press\\". Concerning the photographs, Turton claimed that the Vice-Consul had taken the film to be developed and returned it to Captain Bradford a few days later. Compensation claims Springfjords owners immediately lodged a claim for compensation with the Guatemalan Embassy in London. The ship insured for £170,000 (equating to about $476,000 at the then US–UK exchange rate) with Lloyd's of London's Norwegian subsidiary Norskelloyd. Her cargo was worth about $1.5 million and was underwritten jointly by 78 US insurers, who reached a settlement of $1,250,386 with her owners. On 13 October the USA, through its embassy in Guatemala, told Col. Castillo to offer $900,000. Castillo agreed and on 19 October gave the offer to the UK's Embassy in Guatemala. In the UK House of Commons on 8 November 1954 the Labour MP Marcus Lipton asked whether Col. Castillo's military junta had paid any compensation for Springfjords destruction. The new Conservative Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, replied that on 16 October 1954 the juntas foreign minister had said his government was prepared to discuss paying \\"a reasonable sum in compensation\\" and would instruct the new Guatemalan ambassador to London to do so. A month later no settlement had been reached, so on 8 December 1954 Lipton asked \\"...why, in South America, this Government appears to be so flabby in protecting British interests? Is he further aware that the Government have become very unpopular with Lloyds? Robin Turton replied that the Government was not responsible for preparing the claim, and tried to explain the delay by saying \\"legal gentlemen do take a long time over these matters.\\" The CIA's 1 July 1955 memorandum claims that the UK did not reply to Guatemala's offer, and that therefore on 17 January 1955 the US Embassy in Guatemala suggested to Col. Castillo that he \\"prod the British for a reply\\". It claims that the UK replied on 1 March \\"requesting clarification as to whether the $900,000 was intended to cover only the ship and that portion of the cargo insured in Britain.\\" CIA Headquarters then advised Col. Castillo that the $900,000 was to cover both the ship and her cargo and was to be shared proportionately between the two groups of insurers. In Guatemala City on 13 June 1955 the UK Embassy told the US Embassy that there had been a news leak about the negotiations between Castillo and the UK. According to the leak, US underwriters had submitted a $1.2 million claim to the Guatemalan Embassy in Washington DC and later raised it to $1.7 million, while UK underwriters had presented the Foreign Office with a claim for $1.3 million. Of that $1.3 million $280,000 was for the cargo, and it was indicated that the Foreign Office considered that part of the claim to be inflated. The CIA's 1955 memorandum quotes someone, whose identity is erased from the published copy, as advising that \\"it was doubtful whether the matter could be settled for $900,000\\" and that A more realistic figure is stated to be $1,500,000 to $2,000,000.\\" The relevant CIA station therefore recommended that Col. Castillo be authorized to increase his offer. CIA Headquarters replied that \\"additional funds would be made available if necessary but it was added that all possibilities be exhausted before authorizing Castillo to make a settlement\\". In July 1957 Col. Castillo was assassinated by one of his own guards, and after a series of short-term successors General Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes became president of Guatemala. A memorandum dated 25 July 1958 from JC King, who was CIA Chief, Western Hemisphere Division states that the claimants' lawyer, Hafael Valls, visited Gen. Ydígoras, was initially well-received but subsequently was expelled from Guatemala. Valls accordingly proposed that the US Government take over leadership of the claim, and withhold any further aid or loans to Guatemala until the claim is settled. King asserted that all representations for settlement had hitherto been made by British interests and that Gen. Ydígoras was very anti-British.There is a long-running territorial dispute between Guatemala and the UK over British Honduras (now Belize). King therefore recommended against the US pursuing the claim as Guatemala would regard this as the US acting on behalf of the UK rather than for itself. For this reason such an approach would be bound to fail and would only make the US unpopular with Gen. Ydígoras and many other Guatemalans. King also warned that Guatemala knew the aircraft that attacked Springfjord was not Guatemalan, and if US pressure to settle the claim provoked Guatemala that country might use its knowledge of the CIA's engineering of the 1954 coup to embarrass the USA. King concluded by stressing that US aid was to improve Guatemala's economy and its people's living standards \\"in order to eliminate the climate for the growth of Communism\\", and therefore the US could not risk giving the Springfjord claim precedence over aid to Guatemala. Eighteen months after King's secret memo there was still no compensation payment, so on 10 February 1960 Marcus Lipton raised the question in the Commons again. The Conservative MP Robert Allan replied that the UK government had repeatedly asked the Guatemalan government to pay compensation for the sinking. Allan stated that \\"At one time the Guatemalan Government intimated that they would be prepared to pay some compensation, but the amount they offered was totally unacceptable to the claimants.\\" No compensation had been paid almost 13 years after the attack, so in 1967 Lipton submitted a written question asking the then Labour Government's Foreign Secretary \\"what steps he has taken to obtain compensation from the Guatemalan Government\\". On 12 June 1967 William Rodgers MP replied to the Commons that in 1963 Guatemala had suspended diplomatic relations with the UK and since then the UK government had been unable to continue to pursue the claim.

Many also watched the event that was televised on giant screens across the country. The star of the flotilla was the Royal Barge, the Spirit of Chartwell, which was festooned with numerous flowers. Aboard the vessel were Queen Elizabeth; Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Charles, Prince of Wales; his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; Prince William, Duke of Cambridge; his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge; and Prince Harry. The festivities ended with fireworks from Tower Bridge, and the National Anthem performed by the Royal College of Music Chamber Choir and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The flotilla also represented the first public event of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust. The goal of the trust is fundraising for worthy causes in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, particularly those that benefit the young. Planning Ocean Village Marina, host of the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla The proposal for a local flotilla to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee originated at the Ocean Village Marina in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. The idea was met with a positive response from boat owners at the marina just north of Gibraltar Harbour, and the Government of Gibraltar was supportive as well. The flotilla was one of numerous events scheduled in honour of the Queen. The plan was for a mid-morning briefing of skippers, followed by a military re-enactment. Also planned were addresses by the Minister for Culture and the Governor of Gibraltar, and a bagpipe recital, with the minister then joining the parade. It was anticipated that the flotilla would be led by HMS Scimitar of the Royal Navy. The flotilla was to leave the marina at noon on 4 June 2012, parading from the west side of the runway of Gibraltar International Airport, past Europa Point, to the east side of the runway. At that point, the vessels would turn around for the return trip. Ros Astengo, the event organiser at Ocean Village, the resort which incorporates two marinas, Ocean Village Marina and Marina Bay, indicated that, in addition to the flotilla \\"with all manner of vessels dressed in streamers and Union Jacks,\\" the resort was \\"encouraging as much onshore support as possible with horn-tooting and flag-waving most welcome.\\" She further noted that the resort's restaurants and bars would be featuring special meals and drinks and that there would be \\"a live band and DJ chill-out music in the evening.\\" At sunset, the aerobeacon on top of the Rock of Gibraltar would be lit. Those who didn't own a vessel were requested to consider the possibility of chartering a yacht. The host of the event aspired to have the participation of one hundred vessels in the flotilla. Expectations exceeded Route of the flotilla from west side of runway past Europa Point to Catalan Bay, and back On Monday, 4 June 2012, 161 vessels assembled at the Ocean Village Marina, exceeding expectations. The participants in the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla were greeted by Gregory Butcher, founder of Ocean Village, and Astengo. This was followed by a brief presentation by representatives of the Gibraltar Port Authority. Recommendations for safety precautions included sunscreen and maintenance of adequate distances between vessels. Given the variety of boats in the flotilla, ranging in length from to , separation of the boats by category was necessary. Small boats were at the front of the parade, followed by power boats more than in length, and, last, sailboats. The General Elliot, a vessel of the Gibraltar Port Authority, led the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla, and was supported by other official vessels. After navigating the Bay of Gibraltar and its assortment of commercial vessels, the flotilla paraded south past Europa Point, where spectators had congregated. Upon reaching Catalan Bay, south of the airport runway and Eastern Beach, the participants in the flotilla greeted spectators on the beach and turned around for the return trip to the marina. A number of participants were passengers on chartered boats. The festivities continued that day at Ocean Village, and included a crew party at the resort's champagne bar. At sunset, the Jubilee Beacon was lit by Kaiane Aldorino, former Miss World.

The partnership was formed in 1862 between German-born cabinetmaker Anthony Kimbel (c. 1821-1895)Obituary: \\"Anthony Kimbel, of the firm of A. Kimbel & Sons, 398 Fifth avenue, died September 23 at his home at 337 West Thirty-second street. Mr. Kimbel was born at Mayence, Germany, seventy-four years ago. He came to this city in 1848, and went into the employ of the late Mr. Boudoine as an expert designer and draughtsman, then at 335 Broadway, where the offices of The Furniture Trade Review now are. In 1855 he formed the firm of Bembe & Kimbel in Warren street. In 1862 he organized the firm of Kimbel & Cabus, which was located at 920- to 930 Broadway for nearly twenty years. In 1880 Mr. Cabus withdrew and Mr. Kimbel took his sons into partnership. Last May he retired, and his sons, Anthony and Henry, are now conducting the business. Mr. Kimbel received the patronage of many of New York's most wealthy citizens, who trusted entirely to his taste when furnishing their houses. He was an enthusiastic student of the art of housefurnishing and read extensively on art topics.\\" William Berri, The Furniture Trade Review and Interior Decorator (1895), p. 149. and French-born cabinetmaker Joseph Cabus (1824-1894). The company was noted for its Modern Gothic and Anglo-Japanese style furniture, which it popularized at the 1876 Centennial Exposition.Company profile, Smithsonian Institution.

In an earlier partnership with Anton Bembe, Kimbel contributed to the decoration of the new House of Representatives Chamber at the U.S. Capitol.[August 19, 1857:] \\"I made a bargain with Mr. [John T.] Hammitt [of the Hammitt Desk Manufacturing Company] of Philadelphia for one-half of the chairs for the House of Representatives at $75 each, delivered. I have telegraphed to Bembe and Kimbel of New York that they might make the other half at $70 each, not including the packing. This makes 262 chairs and the same number of desks in all for the House of Representatives which are now engaged.\\" Source: Capitol Builder: The Shorthand Journals of Montgomery C.

Cabus had a brief partnership with cabinetmaker Alexander Roux.John Werry, Alexander Roux and Joseph Cabus Collaboration from Rare Victorian, February 14, 2007. K & C Kimbel & Cabus won great acclaim at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a display of Modern Gothic furniture. This Aesthetic Movement style was a rebellion against the ornate excesses of Victorian decoration. Modern Gothic furniture had silhouettes that were angular and sometimes asymmetrical, and surfaces that were often ebonized and decorated with incised gilt decoration, inlaid tiles and painting, and strap- like medieval hinges.Company profile, Smithsonian Institution. The eclectic style was short-lived, but had a major influence on the later Arts & Crafts Movement. K & C also created furniture in the Anglo-Japanese style, taking its inspiration from Japanese art and handicrafts. Two more-traditional Kimbel & Cabus commissions were for the interior woodwork of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church (1875) and the Tenth Company Room at the Seventh Regiment Armory (1879–80). By 1878, the American critic Clarence Cook was already pronouncing the Modern Gothic style passé: > \\"There was a little while ago quite a rage for a certain style of furniture > that made a great display of seeming steel hinges, key-plates, and handles, > with inlaid tiles, carving of an ultra-Gothic type, and an appearance of the > ingenuous truth-telling in the construction. The chairs, tables and > bedsteads looked as if they had been on the dissecting-table and flayed > alive,--their joints and tendons displayed to an archaeologic and unfeeling > world. One particular firm [Kimbel & Cabus] introduced this style of > furniture, and, for a time, had almost the monopoly of it. It had a great > run.\\"Clarence Cook, The House Beautiful: Essays on Beds and Tables, Stools > and Candlesticks, (New York: Scribner, Armstrong and Company, 1878), p. 325. The Kimbel & Cabus partnership was dissolved in 1882, with Kimbel going into business with his sons, as A. Kimbel & Sons, and Cabus forming his own shop. Much of Kimbel & Cabus's furniture is unsigned. But a circa-1875 trade catalogue at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum contains photographs of hundreds of pieces. Examples of their work are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Hudson River Museum, the High Museum of Art, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in Great Britain.

In 1933, the Buffelspoort Dam was built, allowing the local farmers to irrigate their crops. The farming community grew in the 1960s on the back of lucrative tobacco farming, but other diversified farming practices i.e. cattle, maize, chillies, paprika, soya, lusern and sunflower amongst the main groups was the main economic driver of the area.

The surface is smooth with a polished appearance. Sutures are radial to oblique, straight or curved. The aperture is a narrow arched slip at the base of the apertural face, partly closed by an apertural place.

It was heavily damaged by Russian, Tartars, Polish and the Swedish troops during the Northern Wars. The word 'Salacgrīva' means 'Mouth (estuary) of Salaca'. History In 1226, Albert of Riga had the three-tower castle Salis or Salismünde built about half a kilometer from the river mouth, which served as a powerful fortress to monitor access to the port of Salaca. Captured in 1391 and burned in 1564, it was drastically damaged in 1575 by Russian and Tartar warriors who fought side by side with the troops of Duke Magnus of Holstein. In 1581, it was attacked by the Swedish troops of Commander Thomas von Enden, and during the Second Northern War it was almost destroyed. Between 1702 and 1704, it was finally demolished, and since then there have been no restoration works carried out there.

Vol. 16, No. 5, pp. 375-389. A key difference between peace economics and these related fields is that peace economics emphasizes a study of the presence of peace, as distinct from studying the absence or presence of conflict, violence, war, or insecurity. Other definitions Peace economics has also been defined as \\"the use of economics to understand the causes and effects of violent conflict in the international system and the ways that conflict can be avoided, managed, or resolved.\\"Anderton, Charles H. and John R. Carter. (2007). \\"A Survey of Peace Economics,\\" pp. 1211-1258 in Todd Sandler and Keith Hartley, eds., Handbook of Defense Economics. Vol. 2. Amsterdam: Elsevier. The quote is from p. 1212. This restricts the subject matter to the international realm and leaves out the study of peace itself. Walter Isard defines peace economics as \\"generally concerned with: (1) resolution, management or reduction of conflict in the economic sphere, or among behaving units in their economic activity; (2) the use of economic measures and policy to cope with and control conflicts whether economic or not; and (3) the impact of conflict on the economic behavior and welfare of firms, consumers organizations, government and society.\\"Isard, Walter. (1994). \\"Peace Economics: A Topical Perspective.\\" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 11-13. The quote is from p. 11. [A slightly revised reprint of Walter Isard, \\"Peace Economics\\" in Douglas Greenwald, Editor in Chief, The McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Economics. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994, pp. 767-769.] The notion of violence is absent and peace itself is not studied, but the level of analysis can be other than conflict between states. In a context restricted to international trade, another author writes that \\"Peace economics studies ways to eradicate and control conflict as well as to assess conflict's impact on society.\\"Polachek, Solomon W. (1994). \\"Peace Economics: A Trade Theory Perspective.\\" Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy. Vol. 1, No. 2, pp.14-17. The quote is from p. 14. The notion of violence is not explicit and the benefits of peace are seen only inasmuch as a reduction of conflict may improve opportunities for expanded global trade. Others make a distinction between \\"productive\\" and \\"unproductive\\" or \\"appropriative\\" economic activities their starting point of analysis in peace economics.Haavelmo, Trygve. (1954).

Aldershot, UK: Elgar. a sentiment not now commonly agreed among economists. These definitions of peace economics all share Johan Galtung's characterization of negative peace (the absence of violent conflict) as opposed to positive peace (the presence of peace-enabling structures). Methods, norms, and context A number of peace economists are explicit about the use of particular explanatory schema to be applied in peace economics, e.g., rational choice theory.Dacey, Ray. (1994). \\"Peace Economics as the Political Economy of Peace and War.\\" Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 1, pp.8-12. In contrast, the main definition of peace economics is open to a variety of approaches. Virtually all authors acknowledge that peace economics is part of both positive economics and normative economics.Arrow, Kenneth J. (1995). \\"Some General Observations on the Economics of Peace and War, Peace Economics.\\" Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy. Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 1-8. While for most contemporary economists, work in positive economics may lead them to lay out a descriptive array or evaluation of policy choices from which one that is most valued is recommended to or chosen by policy makers, in peace economics, in contrast, it is the norm of peace to be achieved that inspires the search for a system design that can reliably deliver on the desired norm. Peace economics is built on general systems theory exemplified by the work of Kenneth Boulding.Boulding, Kenneth E. (1970). \\"Economics as a Social Science,\\" pp. 1-22 and \\"Economics as a Political Science,\\" pp. 77-96, both in Kenneth E. Boulding, Economics as a Science. New York: McGraw-Hill. Earth may be viewed as a self-regulating (homeostatic) system, consisting of natural and social subsystems. In each, deviation from a set goal is self-corrected through feedback loops. Homeostatic systems are commonly observed in nature, such as in ecology and in the physiology of organisms (e.g., self-regulation of population sizes, self-regulation of body heat). The systems concept has been adopted in the engineering sciences, for example in designing thermostats. The user sets a desired goal state (temperature), the instrument measures the actual state, and for a deviation of sufficient degree a corrective action is taken (heating or cooling). Relatively new is the insight that social systems designed to achieve certain purposes (e.g., the retirement or pension system) imply a choice architecture that may permit failed or failing social systems to persist. Similarly, choice architecture may facilitate the (re)design of institutions aimed at securing beneficial social outcomes such as peace. This is social engineering applied to the problem of peace (peace engineering)Fischer, Dietrich. (1993). Nonmilitary Aspects of Security: A Systems Approach. Brookfield, VT: Dartmouth Publ. and overlaps with ideas of mechanism design (reverse game theory) in which a solution is stipulated a priori and the structure of the game that would bring about the desired outcome is inferred. In this way, system design links back to normative economics. Examples =Free trade and peace= Economic ties between the US, EU, China, Russia and India in 2014 (thickness of the lines is proportional to the bilateral trade volume) The classical English liberals of the 19th century largely believed that free trade promoted peace. This view, attributed to Adam Smith and Edmund Burke, was evident in the advocacy of Richard Cobden and John Bright, and in the writings of the most prominent English economists and political thinkers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as John Stuart Mill and Alfred Marshall. John Maynard Keynes said that he was \\"brought up\\" on this idea.Donald Markwell, John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace, Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2. A prominent 20th century US exponent of this idea was the Secretary of State under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Cordell Hull. =World War I and the Paris Peace Conference= Upon resigning from the United Kingdom's Treasury team at the Paris Peace Conference in June 1919, John Maynard Keynes penned a small book. Published in 1920, The Economic Consequences of the Peace famously lays out his case for why the allies' Terms of Peace to be imposed on Germany were physically and financially impossible to fulfill and how they would encourage Germany to rise up again. Predicting a coming World War II, Keynes wrote: \\"... if this view of nations and of their relation to one another (i.e., a Carthaginian Peace) is adopted by the democracies of Western Europe, and is financed by the United States, heaven help us all. If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final civil war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever is victor, the civilisation and the progress of our generation.\\"Keynes, John M. (1920). The Economic Consequences of the Peace. London: Macmillan. The quote is from p. 251. Although Keynes' effort to change the treaty terms failed, it is a dramatic demonstration of what peace economics is about: the creation of a mutually reinforcing structure of political, economic, and cultural systems to achieve peace such that reversal to violence is unlikely. =Capitalism and war, and managed capitalism= In the 1930s, in the midst of the Great Depression and with the rise of fascist powers, many western socialist and liberal thinkers believed that capitalism caused war. However, Keynes in his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936, argued that this need not be so, and that the management of capitalism along the lines he proposed to promote high employment would be more conducive to peace than laissez-faire capitalism with the gold standard had been. This analysis underlay his approach during World War II to the creation of institutions for international economic governance in the post-war world.Donald Markwell, John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace, Oxford University Press, 2006, chapters 5 & 6. =World War II, Bretton Woods, and the Marshall Plan= Late in World War II, as Nazi-Germany's eventual defeat appeared clear, Henry Morgenthau, Jr., then-Secretary of the United States Treasury, advocated the partitioning of Germany, stripping it of its most valuable raw materials and industrial assets, and envisioned the complete pastoralization of Germany. Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill agreed to the Morgenthau Plan, in modified form, on 16 September 1944. Following victory, Germany's remaining factories were dismantled, parts, machinery, and equipment shipped abroad, patents expropriated, research forbidden, and useful engineers and scientists transferred out of the country. Despite the negotiation of international treaties at Bretton Woods to create a set of complementary global monetary, trade, and reconstruction and development institutions, namely the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (today part of the World Bank Group), and, separately, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (incorporated in today's World Trade Organization), Germany's and Europe's other postwar economies collapsed. Keynes' Economic Consequences of the Peace appeared to repeat themselves. However, Roosevelt had died and Harry S. Truman assumed the U.S. American Presidency on 12 April 1945. Even as the deindustrialization of Germany proceeded as planned, Truman's first Secretary of State, James F. Byrnes, by 1947 took a dismal view of its effects on Germany's impoverished population. So did former president Herbert C. Hoover in a series of reports penned in 1947. Meanwhile, Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union emerged as a formidable power and the implication seemed clear: An economically strengthened, resurgent Germany could either be part of a new Western political, economic, and cultural alliance or else be incorporated into a Soviet one. Truman thus came to abolish the punitive measures imposed on Germany, and his new Secretary of State, General George C. Marshall, formulated what would become the Marshall Plan, in effect from 1948 to 1952. The new global institutions and the unilateral Marshall Plan action combined to endow new institutions with sufficient resources to result in a somewhat unwitting peace economics: clearly designed toward the purpose of international peace and prosperity, yet skewed toward Western Europe and the incipient Cold War. Moreover, the new social architecture was invested with incentives, such as the United Nations Security Council that provided five of its members with permanent seats and veto powers, that, while keeping superpower peace, threatened peace and prosperity in the post-colonial Third World. =Origins of the European Union= Like Keynes, Jean Monnet participated in the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, in Monnet's case as an assistant to the French delegation. Like Keynes, he envisioned a pan-European economic cooperation zone. Like Keynes, he would be disappointed. Despite this, the French appreciated his good efforts and awarded him with the post of Deputy Secretary-General of the then newly founded League of Nations. Monnet was but 31 years old. He resigned four years later to devote himself to international business and finance in private capacity but resurfaced during the early World War II years in positions of high influence in France, Britain, and the United States, urging Roosevelt to get on with an industrial armaments plan. Following World War II, Monnet, however, at first crafted the Monnet Plan which, similar to Morgenthau's, envisioned the transfer of the German Ruhr and Saarland territories, raw materials, and industries (coal and steel) to France to assist it in its own reconstruction. This was approved by French Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle shortly before his resignation in January 1946. The transfer of the Saar region took place with U.S. help in 1947, while the Ruhr region was placed under an international authority in 1949 that assured France access to German coal at low prices. This led to rising frictions between Germany and the allies, just as Keynes had foretold 30 years earlier. Monnet changed course and, together with Paul Reuter, Bernard Clappier, Pierre Uri, and Étienne Hirsch, plans were crafted that resulted in the Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950, celebrated today as Europe Day or Schuman Day. Robert Schuman, the Franco-German-Luxembourgian statesman, French Minister of Finance, Minister of Foreign Affairs and two-time Prime Minister of France, envisioned, first, a Franco-German and, then, a pan- European sharing of crucial coal and steel resources among Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg that would make future war \\"not only unthinkable but materially impossible.\\"\\"Declaration of 9 May 1950.\\" http://www.robert-schuman.eu/declaration_9mai.php. (Retrieved on 14 February 2012.) By 1951, this resulted in the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the forerunner to today's European Union. In contrast to the negotiations surrounding the founding of the United Nations and a set of associated organizations in 1945, the European idea appears to have been deliberately designed as a kernel with organic growth-potential, the precise development of which would be learned in future. Thus, no institutional structures were put in place that, due to accrued vested interests, would later prove to be too difficult to change. =Current research directions= War at the interstate level has subsided and, to a degree, so have the massive civil wars that took place in the immediate Post-Cold War period (especially in Africa in the 1990s and 2000s).Human Security Report 2009/2010. Human Security Report Project. http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security- reports/20092010/overview.aspx (Retrieved 14 February 2012.) For longer-term trends, see Steven Pinker, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined (New York: Viking, 2011) and literature cited therein. But violent conflict takes place at many levels, from self-directed harm (e.g., self- injury and suicide) and domestic violence between intimate partners and family members to workplace violence and organized criminal violence, all of which are massively costly and ultimately require positive, structural solutions whereby resort to violence becomes \\"unthinkable,\\" even as it may remain \\"materially possible.\\" The Institute for Economics and Peace, a think tank with offices in Sydney, New York, and Mexico City, is \\"developing metrics to analyse peace and to quantify its economic value. It does this by developing global and national indices, calculating the economic cost of violence, analysing country-level risk and understanding positive peace.\\" http://economicsandpeace.org/ More recently, there is a turn towards local implications of economic reforms in conflict-affected societies in an attempt to understand how economies of peace impact on the everyday Distler, Werner, Elena B. Stavrevska, and Birte Vogel. \\"Economies of Peace: Economy Formation Processes and Outcomes in Conflict-Affected Societies.\\" (2018): 139–150. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13698249.2018.1500164.

The bank was among the first digital banks in the world.How BofI Holding Revolutionized the Banking Industry The bank's holding company, BofI Holding, Inc., was incorporated in the state of Delaware in July 1999 for the stated purpose of organizing and opening an Internet-based bank. The opening day of the bank was on July 4 for three reasons. One, Mr Englert wanted its customers to realize that although traditionally July 4 is a bank holiday, people would still be able to access the bank due to its online format. Second, he wanted to pay homage to his oldest daughter's birthday. Finally, the theme of the bank \\"Independence from traditional banking\\" jibed with the holiday's history.In an interview between Jerry Englert and Chris Englert in Mr Englert's home, January 5, 2013. The bank was launched with $14 million in startup capital and was profitable within 14 months. The bank's thrift charter allowed it, and continues to allow it, to operate within all 50 states. The bank went public on NASDAQ as Bank of Internet USA on March 15, 2005.Bank of Internet USA Debuts The number of employees running and managing the bank has grown from 35 in 2007 to 534 as of December 31, 2015. In October 2011, Bank of Internet USA changed its name to BofI Federal Bank. However, BofI Federal Bank continued to use the Bank of Internet USA brand for its online consumer direct banking. The goal of Bank of Internet USA remained to provide banking services more cost-effectively by eliminating the overhead costs of branches. According to Andrew Micheletti, CFO and VP of BofI Holding, Inc., “We are taking advantage of the Internet for both efficiency in the back office and efficiency in the distribution and delivery of banking products.” In April 2014, the bank purchased the bank unit of H&R; Block.BofI Federal Buy H&R; Block Bank In 2018, the bank became the exclusive provider of H&R; Block's refund anticipation loans.Could Bank of Internet be a Millionaire Maker Stock Axos has been a supporter of the United States Navy SEAL Family Foundation since 2014.BofI Federal Bank Supports Seal Foundation From 2013 to the end of 2015, Bank of Internet USA saw a 327% growth in the number of savings deposits. Part of that growth may be attributed to Bank of Internet acquiring a portion of H&R; Block's banking business in 2014, including 300,000 individual retirement accounts (IRAs).

Early life Lascaris was born on 28 June 1560, the second son of Giannetto Lascaris and his wife Franceschetta di Agostino Lascaris of the ancient family of the Counts of Ventimiglia, related to the Lascaris who were emperors of the Byzantine Nicaean Empire. Palais Palazzo Lascaris de Vintimille à Castellar In 1584, he entered the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. As a member of the order he lived for over thirty years in a priory and was responsible for a range of monastic functions. He was put in charge of the order's grain supplies and later, in 1615, the order's furnaces across the island. He comported himself well and was promoted to master of the \\"St Anthony\\" prison. In 1632 he was sent as ambassador to the Kingdom of Spain. On the death of Grand Master Antoine de Paule, there were three candidates for election as Grand Master; Lascaris, Signorino Gattinara (about whom little is known) and Martin de Redin. Inquisitor Fabio Chigi (later Pope Alexander VII) attended as representative of Pope Urban VIII. Failing to secure enough votes for his own election, de Redin encouraged his supporters to instead side with Lascaris. On 16 June 1636, Lascaris was elected Grand Master of the Order of Malta, a position he held until his death. As Grand Master =Lascaris towers= Lippija Tower, the first of the Lascaris towers The following year, Lascaris commissioned a series of towers as fortifications around the island of Malta,Gneja Tower Christian Formosa, \\"A Military History of Malta\\", University of Malta, Faculty of Education – Retrieved on 26 July 2007 now known as the Lascaris towers. The towers were designed and built by papal military architect, Vincenzo Maculani. History of the popes; their church and state (Volume III) by Leopold von Ranke (2009, Wellesley College Library) Lascaris Battery was named in his honor. Martin de Redin, who succeeded Lascaris as Grand Master of the Order, commissioned further towers and the combined collection of fortifications is often referred to as the De Redin towers. =Lascaris' ban= In 1639, Lascaris implemented a ban on women wearing masks or attending masked balls during carnivale. The ban was unpopular and locals blamed Lascaris' Jesuit confessor, Father Cassia. They took to the streets to poke fun at the Jesuits and Lascaris had one of the instigators arrested. A Jesuit college was ransacked as retaliation and those responsible demanded that Lascaris banish the Jesuit order from Malta, which he did for a short time while tensions abated. The incident is still remembered today as Lascaris' ban.Cassar Pullicino, Joseph. \\"The Order of St. John in Maltese Folk-Memory\\" . Melitensia. p. 173. =Wars of Castro= Giuseppe Caloriti's View of Valletta and the Three Cities with the galleon \\"Lascara\\" (named in honour of Lascaris) entering the harbour of Malta's capital, Valletta. Also in 1639, Pope Urban VIII asked Lascaris to intervene in the First War of Castro by sending naval forces owned by the order to assist papal troops against the Dukes of Parma; specifically galleons and other warships. But the Dukes of Parma, as well as the Duchy of Venice, the Duchy of Florence and Duchy of Modena (who were allied with them), appealed to Lascaris not to provide the pope with support.Biographical Dictionary of Italy: Lascaris, Giovanni Paolo (Volume 63, 2004) Lascaris played a dangerous double game; he sent warships to aid the pope while assuring the Dukes they were there only as a show of force and would not participate in the conflict. Sure enough, conflict was limited to on-land skirmishes and Lascaris' troops never fired a single shot. =Caribbean colonies= In 1651, the Knights, with Lascaris's approval, bought the island of Saint-Christophe, along with the dependent islands of Saint Croix, Saint Barthélemy, and Saint Martin, from the failing Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique. The Knights' ambassador to the French court, Jacques de Souvré, signed the agreement. The Order's proprietary rights were confirmed in a treaty with France two years later: while the king would remain sovereign, the Knights would have complete temporal and spiritual jurisdiction on their islands. The only limits to their rule were that they could only send French knights to govern the islands, and upon the accession of each new King of France they were to provide a gold crown worth 1,000 écus. In 1665, after Lascaris's death, the Knights sold their islands back to France, ending their brief colonial project. =The Gozo monastery= In October 1652 Pope Innocent X closed a number of monasteries including one on Gozo. However, it was opened again after just four months thanks to intervention from Lascaris who was close to the monks of the order. A portrait of Lascaris still hangs in the monastery today.
