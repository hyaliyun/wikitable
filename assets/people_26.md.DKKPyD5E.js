Brokers in the U.S. may be \\"associated\\" with one or more Brokerage firms and must obtain licenses by passing standardized Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) exams such as the Series 6 or Series 7 exam. See List of Securities Examinations for types of securities licenses in the U.S. More specifically, selling away describes the situation in which the transaction or securities in question are not approved for sale by the firm; they are not on the firm‚Äôs approved product list. The approved product list identifies the types of securities and investments that are approved for brokers to sell after the securities have been analyzed during the brokerage firm's due diligence process, which includes receiving the necessary risk and compliance department reviews and approvals. Selling away often involves investment securities that are in the form of a private placement or other non-public investment, though not always. Sometimes a transaction may not be an obvious or apparent 'investment' or security. Selling away may not always be deliberate or intentional or with even intent to deceive an investor, but in many cases, the broker deliberately solicited one or more investments without approval of the firm with which he is associated. Selling away is often conducted in conjunction with a broker's outside business activity (another business or activity that a broker conducts outside of and separate from the securities brokerage activities at his/her associated firm.) Selling away situations may result from a broker's desire not to pass up on earning a commission on an investment product his client is willing to buy, and further, not to have to share the commission with his/her associated firm. Selling away schemes may be especially dangerous for investors because the investor may end up becoming a victim of theft, securities fraud, or other loss related to the investment. These schemes often involve the sale of promissory notes which are essentially loans to the broker wherein the borrower promises to pay investors a high rate of interest for the loan from the investor. Once the investor (client) remits the money, the borrower may sooner or later stop (or never begin) paying the interest and the client‚Äôs investment may not be returned.http://www.dossfirm.com/lawyer-attorney-1420905.html Securities regulations; liability of the brokerage firm Generally, selling away is a violation of securities regulations and the firm's compliance procedures unless it is approved in advance. Further, such \\"outside\\" investments may in themselves be fraudulent. The regulatory basis for selling away cases is found in FINRA rule 3270 (formerly NASD rule 3030). Rule 3270 provides that a brokerage firm representative may not engage in any outside business activity unless he has provided prompt written notice to his or her brokerage firm. Rule 3040 provides that a brokerage firm representative must not engage in private securities transactions (that is, selling away) unless approved by the firm and states the procedures that a brokerage firm must follow to approve of such investments. Once approved, the brokerage firm must supervise these private securities transactions. Brokers are cautioned by FINRA about practices that could violate securities regulations, including selling away. \\"Selling securities without processing the order through your firm and without your firm's permission or knowledge is a violation of FINRA rules. Even products that you may not consider to be securities, such as leasing arrangements or promissory notes, may be securities under federal or state law. Check with your firm before engaging in any securities transactions for any purpose.\\" The firm may not have advance knowledge of such sales and activities. The question then becomes whether the brokerage firm \\"should have known\\" of the outside sales and activities. Robert Lowry, a securities law expert, suggests that the brokerage firm must demonstrate three things to prove it is not liable. First, that the firm has a reasonable supervisory system in place. Second, that the firm implemented its procedures in a reasonable fashion. Third, that the firm vigorously investigated red flags, which would have been any suggestion of irregularity or unusual trading activity, including client complaints and disciplinary actions by a securities regulator. Claimants' lawyers, on the other hand, must demonstrate that the brokerage firm essentially failed to execute properly on one or more of the three foregoing points, i.e., (i.) failed to establish and/or (ii.) failed to implement reasonable supervisory procedures, or (iii.) failed to properly follow-up on red flags. Robert Lowry suggests that client lawyers provide illustrations of how the brokerage firm's supervision fell through the cracks, thereby causing the client harm. A survey of some FINRA/NASD disciplinary actions illustrates the broad scope of not only the types of investments that are \\"sold away\\" but also the types of brokerage firms. In one example, an adviser from Summit Capital Investment Group convinced 25 clients to invest in a fraudulent pay phone leasing deal. In another example, a representative from Linsco/Private Ledger Corporation (now rebranded LPL Financial) convinced clients to invest in a limited liability company (LLC) investing in real estate. Another example involved a PaineWebber rep who convinced clients to invest in an IPO trading program that was run by an outside entity. These are just some examples of selling away cases, for which the brokerage firm, even if they were unaware of the sales, may still be held responsible, in whole or only in part.http://www.financialcounsel.com/Articles/Investment/ARTINV0000245-SellingAway.asp SEC reverses FINRA ruling Right or wrong, FINRA likely prevails with brokers and firms settling arbitration disputes and complaints according to FINRA's final decision, however, according to Nov. 2008 articles published online by Securities Industry News and Investment News, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in a highly unusual move, reversed FINRA in a recent selling away case appeal. The SEC set aside a FINRA decision in a selling away case where reps allegedly engaged in private securities transactions in violation of NASD Conduct Rule 3040. In its November 7, 2008 opinion, the SEC reversed FINRA predecessor NASD, explaining that the self- regulatory organization (SRO) had presented a ‚Äúnew theory of liability‚Äù that amounted to a novel interpretation of Rule 3040, which requires registered representatives to obtain approval before engaging in business activity away from their firm. It concluded that the record ‚Äúprovides insufficient support‚Äù that either of the two reps involved (James Browne or Kevin Calandro, two Dallas-based brokers formerly of PaineWebber Inc. of New York) participated in transactions in violation of the rule. ‚ÄúIn sum, we ‚Ä¶ dismiss those charges,‚Äù said the commission. FINRA spokesperson Herbert Perone declined to comment on the decision. For conduct dating to 1998, NASD had ordered that Browne be suspended for six months and fined $25,000, and Calandro three months and $5,000; because they were appealed, the suspensions never went into effect. The reps allegedly engaged in private deals without first providing written notice or obtaining approval from their member firm. The stock involved was that of e2 Communications, a software provider that filed for bankruptcy in 2002. Subsequent to e2‚Äôs bankruptcy filing, NASD filed a complaint alleging that between 1999 and 2000, Browne and Calandro referred a number of investors to the vendor and received compensation in the form of shares. In its explanation of liability, NASD said that ‚Äúthe receipt of selling compensation alone constitutes participation in the transactions for purposes of Rule 3040.‚Äù In its ruling, the SEC countered that NASD had created a new interpretation of Rule 3040 without providing prior notice to the applicants. ‚ÄúThis lack of notice alone raises sufficient concerns to warrant dismissal of the charges,‚Äù said the commission, adding that the SRO also failed to establish a connection between the reps‚Äô referrals and the e2 stock transactions. ‚ÄúThere was no proof that they were making introductions for investment purposes. Plus there was a significant time period between the introductions and the purchases,‚Äù said Brian Rubin, a Washington D.C.-based partner in law firm Sutherland Asbill & Brennan (now renamed \\"Sutherland\\") who represented Browne in the appeal. Rubin added that he has been unable to find another instance of the SEC reversing an NASD ruling for at least a decade. Rubin, a former NASD deputy chief counsel of enforcement, said it is not unusual for reps that are selling away to avoid telling their firms because they are selling questionable products. However, ‚ÄúIn this case,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe representatives knew people at the firm, e2, and introduced friends and clients to persons involved at e2, for the purposes of networking and for potential business between the two sides--but not for investment reasons.‚Äù Mr. Browne, who was once one of PaineWebber's biggest producers, was fired from now defunct Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. of New York in 2003 because of the FINRA investigation, said Rubin. Browne now works for a hedge fund and Calandro now works at SMH Capital Inc., a subsidiary of Sanders Morris Harris Group Inc. of Dallas. In upholding the NASD hearing panel‚Äôs 2006 decision, the NASD National Adjudicatory Council in December 2007 agreed that the case presented ‚Äúuncommon and unusual‚Äù facts, added Rubin. ‚ÄúIn our view, NASD pushed the envelope too far with respect to this type of violation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd the SEC agreed with us.‚Äù As a result, ‚ÄúIndividuals and firms should think long and hard before they decide to settle with FINRA.\\" FINRA's theory in going after Mr. Browne and Mr. Calandro was that, since startups like e2 often seek funding from various individuals involved with the company, the brokers should have known that introducing their clients to e2 would lead those clients to make investments in e2. \\"This was a junk case that never should have been brought,\\" said Mr. Calandro's attorney, E. Steve Watson of E. Steve Watson Attorney at Law in Allen, Texas. Watson said the decision will \\"cut down the boundaries\\" of prior selling-away cases that gave enforcers wide latitude. \\"I'm using it [the decision] a lot\\" in arguing other cases, said Jonathan Kord Lagemann, a Chatham, N.Y.-based defense attorney who is not connected to the case. \\"The moral here is ... there is value in forcing regulators to try their cases,\\" said Pete Michaels, a defense attorney at Michaels Ward & Rabinovitz LLP in Boston who is not involved in the case.http://www.securitiesindustry.com/news/22991-1.html?zkPrintable=truehttp://www.investmentnews.com/article/20081130/REG/312019966  References  External links  *FINRA website *\\"Selling Away\\"; A Primer for Investors and Their Attorneys by James J.

Before his death, Rosenberg recorded a video message saying if he were murdered, √Ålvaro Colom Caballeros, President of Guatemala, Gustavo Alejos, Sandra Torres de Colom, and Gregorio Vald√©s would have been directly responsible. His subsequent killing caused a national uproar. After an investigation by a United Nations commission, officials declared that Rosenberg had arranged his own death and had contacted cousins of his former wife, Francisco Jos√© Ram√≥n Vald√©s Paiz and Jos√© Estuardo Vald√©s Paiz, to hire a hitman.Guatemalan leader cleared of murder CSMonitor Carlos Castresana, the head of the CICIG, the United Nations Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, who headed the investigation at that time, emphasized that this was a provisional hypothesis. The cousins accused were sent to jail for complicity in a hearing behind closed doors, where they remained without a trial for more than two years. Further investigation by the same commission has turned up links between the men who shot Rosenberg and those of Marjorie and Khalil Musa. Two of the killers who took part in both killings and had originally changed their testimony to accuse the Vald√©s Paiz brothers have accused the Public Ministry of Guatemala and the United Nations Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala of pressuring them to accuse the Vald√©s Paiz brothers. The killing Rosenberg's recorded video message claiming that President Colom would be responsible if he were killed Rosenberg was shot dead on May 10, 2009, while cycling in Guatemala City. He was approached by an assassin who came down a grass bank and shot him in the back. The killer ran around Rosenberg's left side and fired another bullet down his cheek, which exited from his neck, and another, which did not exit, into his neck. The killer then knelt on his right side and placed the gun under Rosenberg's jaw, firing another bullet that tore through Rosenberg's eye and went out his left temple. Finally, the murderer moved the gun to Rosenberg's forehead as it faced away from him and fired a final shot, which lodged in his brain. The video seen around the world In an 18-minute videotape recorded prior to his death he said that President √Ålvaro Colom wanted him dead and would be responsible should he be murdered: \\"If you are watching this message, it is because I was assassinated by President √Ålvaro Colom, with help from Colom's private secretary Gustavo Alejos.\\" Rosenberg claimed his death would be due to his involvement with two clients: Khalil Musa, a prominent businessman, and Musa's daughter, Marjorie, who were both assassinated in April 2009. Khalil Musa had been nominated by members of President Colom's government to serve on the board of Guatemala's Banrural (Rural Development) bank. Rosenberg claimed the President, Sandra de Colom (the First Lady of Guatemala), members of the Colom Administration, and their business associates were using Banrural to embezzle and launder money, and because Musa would not tolerate this corruption he was assassinated. The video called for Colom to step down and Vice President of Guatemala Rafael Espada to replace him. It ended with, > ... the only reality that counts is this: if you saw and heard this message, > it is because I was killed by √Ålvaro Colom and Sandra de Colom, with the > help of Gustavo Alejos. Guatemalans, the time has come. Please ‚Äî it is time. > Good afternoon. Political crisis The airing of the video at Rosenberg's funeral, then uploaded to YouTube and broadcast on national television, precipitated a political crisis in Guatemala. Protesters demonstrated in Guatemala City's Central Plaza, and opponents urged president Colom to step down from office. President Colom appeared on national television to reject Rosenberg's accusations and called for both the United Nations and the FBI to investigate. In an interview with CNN Espa√±ol, Colom asserted the Rosenberg video was \\"completely fake\\", thus challenging early reports from the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which validated its authenticity. On May 13, 2009, the United States Ambassador to Guatemala, Stephen G. McFarland, confirmed that FBI personnel had arrived in Guatemala to aid in the investigation. At least one blogger, Jean Anleu Fern√°ndez, was arrested on charges of \\"inciting financial panic\\" after he urged readers to withdraw deposits from Banrural. Anleu had suggested on the social messaging network Twitter that all account holders should withdraw their funds from Banrural. He was placed under house arrest on May 14, 2009. Anleu's short message, \\"Primera accion real 'sacar el pisto de Banrural' quebrar al banco de los corruptos,\\" resulted in a judge ordering his detention and suggesting a fine of up to GTQ50,000. Attempts to censor Anleu's message backfired, because of internet phenomenon called the Streisand effect. A Guatemalan appeals court ruled on 10 July 2009 that the case lacked merit. Some US$7,000 was spent on Anleu's legal fees, half contributed by Twitter users by PayPal. Vice president Espada filed a criminal complaint against journalist, Marta Yolanda D√≠az-Dur√°n. In August, 2010, the Constitutional Court rejected the vice president's complaint on the grounds that the columnist was \\"protected by the right to freedom of thought\\". United Nations investigation By September 12, 2009, Guatemalan police arrested a total of nine men, among them two active policemen, two former policemen and an ex-soldier and three other gang members, who were charged with Rosenberg's killing. In January 2010, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a commission in charge of recommending governmental change backed by the UN and the Guatemalan government, announced the results of its own investigation, concluding that Rosenberg had arranged his own death. It concluded that he asked two cousins of his ex-wife to arrange the assassination of a man he claimed was blackmailing him. However, the target was, according to the CICIG, himself. The cousins are said to have contracted eleven guns-for-hire, most of whom were former or current police officers and one ex-military. Rosenberg was said to have used an anonymous cell phone to call his personal cell phone number, creating the appearance of death threats and to call the hit men on the morning of his death. Investigators traced the phone to his driver from a sales tax receipt. This key piece of evidence was used to convince the Guatemalan populace and the world that Rodrigo Rosenberg had himself killed. The allegation was that he himself contacted the killers via cellphone to give them instructions for the killing. This allegation was based on information that placed the calls made to the killers within Rodrigo Rosenberg's apartment.http://www.cicig.org/uploads/documents/2010/presentacion_caso_rosenberg.pdf The CICIG commission said Rosenberg had been depressed over the murder of the Musas, and especially of Marjorie Musa, with whom he had had a relationship. According to the CICIG, he was convinced the government had killed Marjorie, but lacked the evidence required to pursue the matter in court. They concluded from this that his death therefore was simply a bizarre suicide.The Guatemalan Who Ordered His Own Murder Time Magazine.Guatemala: Investigation Reveals Rosenberg Masterminded His Own Murder Global Voices Online. In light of the discovery, Vice-President Rafael Espada (who Rosenberg had called on to replace President Colom) denied having any contact with Rosenberg or anyone close to him before the murder. More recent information about the Musas' murder indicated that Khalil Musa had finally declined the board of directors nomination, and that a more likely suspect for his murder than government officials was \\"a criminal network\\" from whom he had purchased \\"contraband for his textile factory\\". Several of the people arrested for the killing of Rodrigo Rosenberg were also arrested on 22 September 2010 for participating in the murder of the Musas, including one of the men who was freed for testifying against the Vald√©s brothers, Mario Paz Mej√≠a. Paz Mej√≠a's brother Wilfredo Antonio Paz Mej√≠a was also implicated in their murder. Conflicting accounts Not everyone agrees with the CICIG's conclusion that Rodrigo Rosenberg killed himself, and that the Vald√©s Paiz brothers had anything to do with it. The following evidence contradicts or weakens some of the CICIG's main points, or brings up new questions. Mario Paz Mejia - hitman confesses Mario Paz Mej√≠a, a policeman with connections in high places in the Guatemalan Government, was one of the people captured and originally accused of the murder of Rodrigo Rosenberg in October 2009, six months after the murder. Paz Mej√≠a was eventually freed for collaborating with the authorities. According to Lucas Josu√© Santiago L√≥pez, one of the other members who had no previous record, Paz Mej√≠a threatened and at the same time offered money for Lucas' family, to force him to say that he, Lucas Santiago, had done the shooting. Lucas Santiago's testimony in court about Paz Mej√≠a's role in the killing, the threats and bribery were ignored and the original sentence increased for not collaborating. Paz Mej√≠a was freed, in spite of Castresana's guarantee during the presentation that no one would go free, that the judge would only reduce his sentence, and he remained free until evidence of his participation in the killing of Rodrigo Rosenberg's clients, Khalil and Marjorie Musa, could no longer be denied. Lucas Santiago was once again the alleged hit man in the murder of the Musas. False leads in the investigation Months before Carlos Castresana publicly hypothesized that Rosenberg had killed himself, Ovidio Batz Tax, another self-declared witness, was given money to say that people in the opposition party had Rodrigo Rosenberg killed.http://digital.nuestrodiario.com/Olive/ODE/NuestroDiario/LandingPage/LandingPage.aspx?href=R05ELzIwMDkvMDYvMDk.&pageno;=Ng..&entity;=QXIwMDYwMA..&view;=ZW50aXR5 Journalists were taken in the first lady's, Sandra Torres', helicopter by Salvador Gandara, the minister of Gobernaci√≥n, the state ministry in charge of security matters, to hear the witness make his declaration. Sandra Torres, along with her husband, the President of Guatemala, was one of the people accused in Rosenberg's video. The minister was seen paying the witness and the journalists. The Vald√©s Paiz brothers - falsely accused Another alleged connection between the killers and Jos√© and Francisco Vald√©s came from a number in the memory of one or more of the phones confiscated from an alleged intermediary of the group, Jes√∫s Manuel Cardona Medina, alias Mem√≠n, cousin to one of the band members. The number corresponded to a cell phone which belonged to the company owned by the Vald√©s brothers. The phone was used by Nelson Wilfredo Santos Estrada, the Vald√©s' chief of Security. Nelson Santos has never appeared to testify. Two years after Castresana's public conclusions, the cousins themselves are in jail, having been accused of \\"complicity\\" in the killing of Rosenberg. The main link between them and the killers is the testimony of ten of the members of the band. All ten of them, unanimously \\"...confirmed for us that the only people implicated are the Vald√©s brothers, and no one else, no minister, no chief of police, and no official.\\" This is the same band that Castresana declared to have had a history of murder, drug trafficking, money laundering, kidnapping and extortion, one of whom later admitted to lying under oath. The Alejos brothers - people with power The next linkage involves a check sent by the cousin of one of the men accused by Rosenberg in his famous video. A check for US$40,000 was sent by Luis Alejos, cousin to Gustavo Alejos, the president's private secretary, and brother of the general secretary of the party in power. It arrived in Rodrigo Rosenberg's office three days after he was killed. Rosenberg's secretary testified she had instructions from Rosenberg to deliver the check to his ex-wife's cousin, Francisco Vald√©s. The check didn't have either Rosenberg's or Vald√©s' name on it, but was, according to Carlos Castresana, the payment for the killing, three days after the murder. The check itself was never presented as evidence. Changing testimony Eventually, the band members, several of them ex-policemen, testified one by one that they had been paid Q300,000, the equivalent in dollars to the check supposedly sent by Luis Alejos. One exception was the only alleged intermediary in custody, Jesus Manuel Cardona Medina, who refused to admit for a long time that they had been paid more than Q50,000. This is the same man who refused to \\"ask for forgiveness\\" for the killing because he felt that eliminating an extortionist was a \\"humanitarian gesture.\\" For both cases of intransigence, he was threatened with having his status as collaborator removed. Unlike Paz Mej√≠a, the man who pulled the trigger in this operation, Cardona Medina was found guilty and never freed from jail, although he did receive a reduction in his prison term. Minister of Communications of the Government of Alvaro Colom The man who sent the check, Luis Alejos, was head of the Ministry of Communications of Guatemala. The first direct association between Rosenberg and his killers is testimony by alleged experts in telecommunications who gave evidence that Rosenberg used the cell phone that was used to make the threats to his personal number. The cell phone the threats originated from was never found, even though Rosenberg supposedly used it minutes before his murder, but the owner of the phone was found, Rodrigo Rosenberg's bodyguard, Luis L√≥pez Flori√°n. Luis L√≥pez Florian - the chauffeur Luis L√≥pez Flori√°n was Rodrigo Rosenberg's man Friday. He drove for him, was his bodyguard and was even front man for some of his businesses, such as Landosa Digital, S.A. The store receipt had his name on it; he was recorded on video in the place and time the phone was purchased. He eventually said he bought a second phone, at a different place, which did not have a record of his name and which he said he thought he had delivered to the Vald√©s brothers. This second phone operated in the vicinity of Rosenberg when first purchased and then later in the environs of the intermediary, Cardona Medina. This phone was purportedly delivered to Cardona through the chief of Security of the Vald√©s', one of the men who was never found. It was not stated by Castresana whether the phone was ever found among Cardona Medina's possessions, only that it operated in his vicinity. \\"Entries\\" were made into Rosenberg's accounting records for the purchase of the phones; exactly by whom the entries were made is not made clear by Castresana's presentation, only implied by the word secretariat. The customer receipts were never publicly presented as evidence, only the store receipts were, and only one of them with L√≥pez's name on it. Aside from L√≥pez Flori√°n, there were over 300 policemen involved in the case, close to a dozen officials from the Guatemalan Public Ministry, and several CICIG investigators any of whom, at one time or another, could have had access to the records, especially before the suicide theory was settled on, nine months after the murder. \\"On 8 September 2009, the Fiscal√≠a listened to a conversation in which Santos Divas was warned by another member of the band that L√≥pez had made a document telling about the Rosenberg crime and left it with a general in the Army who would make it public if anything happened to him.\\" Which Lopez is not specified in the Prensa Libre article titled: Agendas Disclose Contact Between Killers and Police. (Agendas delatan contacto de sicarios con polic√≠as. 24/05/10.) Willian [sic] Gilberto Santos Divas was in the car with Mario Paz Mej√≠a during the operation. Rodrigo Rosenberg spoke by cell phone with L√≥pez Flori√°n two minutes before he left his apartment that fateful morning, and told him he was going out for a bike ride. It is at this time that the killers received information about their target, \\"el venado,\\" who was slaughtered ten minutes later. Castresana alleged, but gave no proof other than the telecommunications expert's testimony on the cell-phone's supposed location on that morning, that this information was given by Rosenberg himself. The phone itself was never presented as evidence. L√≥pez Flori√°n called Rodrigo's son while close to the scene of the crime, shortly after the murder, to inform him of his father's death. An eyewitness never questioned by the authorities Approximately half an hour before Rosenberg rode away from his apartment to his death, a person walking some dogs saw a man wearing a suit sitting on the curb where Rosenberg was soon killed. The witness called and reported this fact to the police within minutes of the sighting, but the report was ignored; it never came out in the investigation. The CICIG's early appearance on the scene of the crime The CICIG, however, was at the scene of the crime, together with the vice-minister of Gobernaci√≥nhttp://digital.nuestrodiario.com/Olive/ODE/NuestroDiario/LandingPage/LandingPage.aspx?href=R05ELzIwMDkvMDUvMTE.&pageno;=Mg..&entity;=QXIwMDIwMA..&view;=ZW50aXR5 very shortly after Rosenberg's death, while his body still lay in situ. The video that made it national and international news would not come out until the next day. In charge of the scene of the crime Claudia Mu√±oz, mother of the girlfriend of the Presidential Spokesman, Fernando Barillas was initially in charge of the case. She had a meeting with Gustavo Alejos in the President's house on the day Rosenberg's video came out. Mu√±√≥z's son in law sued her for harassment and death threats. Family declares response to the handling of the case On the 10 August 2011, his son, Eduardo Rosenberg Paiz, made the following comment: \\"We don't care about the final conclusions that a failed system of justice makes about his death,\\" denying that his father's purpose had been to overthrow a particular government, but to \\"turn our Republic into a State of Rule of Law, where governors and governed obey the law and where no crime can remain unpunished.\\" One band of killers - two related murders In September, 2010, Mar√≠a Encarnaci√≥n Mejia, interim attorney general for the CICIG, declared that seven of the eleven people who participated in the murder of Marjorie and Khalil Musa were involved in the killing of Rodrigo Rosenberg. Two of the killers accuse officials of pressuring them to falsely testify In July, 2013, one of these men, Mario Luis Paz Mejia, who was eventually convicted in the killing of Marjorie and Khalil Musa, once again changed his testimony in the Rosenberg case, absolving the Vald√©s Paiz brothers from involvement in Rosenberg's murder. He declared: \\"The Paiz brothers don't have anything to do with this. I never saw them.\\" He stated that the public prosecutor, Rub√©n Herrera, made all kinds of offers in order for him to declare against the Vald√©s Paiz brothers, as well as having been shown two photographs from the papers in order to involve them in the crime. C√©sar Calder√≥n, the defense lawyer, asked Paz Mej√≠a what had been offered by the prosecutors, and he responded that security and Q50,000. Francisco Capuano, another of the defense lawyers, asked the witness who else had pressured him to testify against the Vald√©s Paiz brothers in 2010. Instead of answering, he looked around and pointed to Luis Orozco, an official of the CICIG, the United Nations International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala. The witness said he asked to declare in court because he wanted to clear his conscience and die in peace. He emphasized that it was the Ministerio P√∫blico and the CICIG who had pressured him into lying. In a video a few weeks later, Jes√∫s Manuel Cardona Med√≠na, alias Mem√≠n, accused members of the Public Ministry and the CICIG of pressuring him into accusing the Vald√©s Paiz brothers. They told him that he and the Vald√©s Paiz brothers would be in jail for only three months, that they needed to protect the government. He accuses Rub√©n Herrera, the same public prosecutor mentioned above, of showing him photos and the complete names of the Vald√©s brothers in order to accuse them. Cardona was imprisoned in a maximum security prison, completely isolated, unable to see the light of day or to communicate with anyone during almost three years, precisely because of his reluctance to continue collaborating with what he called a show. Cardona Medina was the same man who previously denied for a long time that they had been paid more than Q50,000, and the same man mentioned above who refused to ask for forgiveness for the killing because he thought that eliminating an extortionist was not something that required forgiveness. Prominent lawyer connected to Rosenberg case and accused of libel by CICIG assassinated by hitman on motorcycle Lea Marie de Le√≥n was killed on one of the principal boulevards of Guatemala City during the day of February 2013. She accused Alvaro Colom of having been involved in Rodrigo Rosenberg's murder. In March, 2011, de Le√≥n was accused of libel by the CICIG while she was defending people who questioned the CICIG's honorability in the Rosenberg case. Career Rosenberg graduated with honors from Rafael Land√≠var University in Guatemala City. He earned a Master of Arts degree in International Law and Comparative Law from the University of Cambridge, St Edmund's College and a Master of Arts in Commercial Law and International Law from Harvard University. In 1987 Rosenberg co-founded Rosenberg-Marzano, Marroquin-Pemueller & Asociados, S.C., a law firm. He specialized in Business/Commercial, Corporate, International, Trademark, Constitutional, Tax, and Procedural Law. He was also on the legal staff of Rodr√≠guez Mahuad & Asociados, another law firm, and was appointed Vice-Dean of the Law School at Rafael Land√≠var University. He also served as president of the Board of Directors of CENAC Foundation (Center for Arbitration and Mediation).

His work has received extensive critical favor and several notable awards. He has been called ‚Äúone of the greatest chroniclers of the mythical American outlaw life‚Äù Jennifer Reese, ‚ÄúCriminal Defense,‚Äù Entertainment Weekly, February 6, 2004 as well as ‚Äúone of the most original writers in America today and ‚Ä¶ certainly one of the bravest.‚Äù Ron Franscell, ‚ÄúBrutal, Beautiful: Violence as Art,‚Äù Chicago Sun-Times, January 25, 2003 He is a recipient of the University of South Florida's Distinguished Humanities Alumnus Award and a member of the Texas Institute of Letters. Biography Blake has written about his boyhood in a memoir essay entitled ‚ÄúThe Outsider‚Äù and has discussed his life and work in a profile in Texas Monthly and in a wide-ranging interview in Firsts. He was born in Tampico, Mexico, a third-generation Mexican descended from American, English, Irish, and Spanish ancestors‚Äîincluding a British pirate who was executed in Veracruz, Mexico‚Äîand is a naturalized American citizen. His father, Carlos Sebastian Blake Hernandez, was a civil engineer born and schooled in Mexico City. His mother, Estrella Maria Lozano Cano, was the daughter of a horse rancher and grew up on the family's ranch near Matamoros. Blake received his elementary education at St. Joseph‚Äôs Academy in Brownsville, Texas and graduated from high school in Miami, Florida. After service in the U. S. Army Airborne (paratroopers), he earned BA and MA degrees at the University of South Florida Tampa Bay and an MFA degree from Bowling Green State University (Ohio), where he attended on a fellowship. He has worked as a snake-catcher, Volkswagen mechanic, swimming pool maintenance man, and county jail properties officer, but his primary occupation has been as a college instructor. He has taught at the University of South Florida, Bowling Green State University, Florida SouthWestern State College, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (Saudi Arabia), and Miami Dade College. In 1997, he left teaching to write full-time. Works Although Blake wrote sporadically from his teens until his thirties, it was not until the early 1980s, while again living in Miami, that he began to write with purpose,Maura McMillan, ‚ÄúA Tribe of One,‚Äù Firsts: the Book Collector‚Äôs Magazine, May, 2001 and over the next few years he published a number of short stories in a variety of literary journals. In 1995 he published his first novel, The Pistoleer, an account of the life and times of the infamous Texas outlaw, John Wesley Hardin. Structured as a sequence of first-person narratives‚Äîeach of the dozens of chapters told by a different character‚Äîthe novel was hailed as ‚Äúan achievement by any standards, but as a first novel is simply astounding.‚Äù Doris Meredith, untitled review, Roundup Magazine, December, 1995 It was a finalist for the 1995 Best Novel of the West award from the Western Writers of America. Despite its ‚Äúwestern‚Äù setting, it was recognized as a significant literary work presenting not only the story of the title character, but also, through its vast array of narrators, a cultural mosaic of the South in the era of Reconstruction. The Pistoleer introduced several motifs that would recur in much of Blake‚Äôs subsequent work‚Äîviolence as art; honor and morality as existential codes; character as fate (a Heraclitean notion that Blake himself has cited as a pervasive theme in his fiction.Diana Anhalt, ‚ÄúHard-Boiled, Soft-Boiled in Galveston,‚Äù Texas Observer, June 20, 2003); and the outlaw as media celebrity.James R. Giles, \\"James Carlos Blake.\\" In Twenty-First-Century American Novelists: Dictionary of Literary Biography (DLB):350, ed. Wanda H. Giles and James R. Giles, 30-38. Detroit, MI: Gale, 2009. In the ten years following the publication of The Pistoleer, Blake published eight more novels and a collection of short works, plus more short stories and two memoir essays. In 1997 his third novel, In the Rogue Blood, gained him considerable attention and won the prestigious Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction. Dealing with the misadventures of a pair of American brothers during the time of the U.S. war with Mexico in the late 1840s, In the Rogue Blood is generally regarded as one of the most compelling works in recent American literature to treat violence as a primary engine of U.S. history. It has been widely compared to Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs savage masterpiece, Blood Meridian.Jan Reid, ‚ÄúLadies and Gentlemen, the Next Cormac McCarthy,‚Äù Texas Monthly, May 1999 While most of Blake‚Äôs short stories‚Äîand a novella, ‚ÄúTexas Woman Blues‚Äù ‚Äî are set in recent times, his four latest books, The Rules of Wolfe (2013), The House of Wolfe (2015), The Ways of Wolfe (2017), and The Bones of Wolfe (2020) are his first contemporary novels. All of his previous novels are set between the mid-19th-century and the latter 1930‚Äôs, and several of them feature historical figures as protagonists. In addition to Wes Hardin, his novels have centered on Pancho Villa, the Mexican bandit and revolutionary (The Friends of Pancho Villa); John Ashley (bandit) of the notorious Ashley criminal gang in early twentieth-century Florida (Red Grass River); ‚ÄúBloody Bill‚Äù Anderson, the Missouri guerrilla captain of the American Civil War (Wildwood Boys); Harry Pierpont, the 1930s gangster and leader of a band of bank robbers that included John Dillinger (Handsome Harry); and Stanley Ketchel, the ragtime-era boxing champion who was murdered at age twenty-four (The Killings of Stanley Ketchel). Even in those of his novels whose protagonists are created of whole cloth (In the Rogue Blood, A World of Thieves, Under the Skin, Country of the Bad Wolfes), real-life people play significant or cameo roles.James R. Giles, \\"James Carlos Blake.\\" In Twenty- First-Century American Novelists: Dictionary of Literary Biography (DLB):350, ed. Wanda H. Giles and James R. Giles, 30-38. Detroit, MI: Gale, 2009. Cultural significance Several of Blake's works have been published in foreign editions, and some are under film option, including The Killings of Stanley Ketchel, which has been optioned by Terence Winter, writer and executive producer of The Sopranos and creator of Boardwalk Empire.Stayton Bonner, ‚ÄúHistory of Violence: James Carlos Blake's The Rules of Wolfe,‚Ä≥ Men's Journal, September 2013 The Friends of Pancho Villa was going to be turned into a movie by director Emir Kusturica, starring Johnny Depp in the leading role, but Depp pulled out. According to Blake, Kusturica spoke to Benicio del Toro about taking over the role, but the movie ultimately did not happen. In interviews writer/director Martin Koolhoven said Blake's novel In the Rogue Blood had an influence on his controversial Brimstone, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2016.

The application consists of several short assignments meant to test an applicant's writing and editing ability. Each summer, the editorial board reviews these applications and invites 25 to 30 applicants to become student writers for the following academic year. As student writers, JCL members write a Note discussing a relevant topic in corporate law. Excellent Notes are selected for publication. In addition, student writers are expected to complete thirty-five secondary hours per semester. This includes time spent at authority checks or on other journal-related projects that the editorial board assigns. Student writers improve their writing and editing skills and contribute to maintaining JCL's status as a high quality publication. Each spring, members of the outgoing editorial board select the next year's board members from the pool of student writers.

Premise The Championship Manager series lets players assume managerial control over their favourite football club in a bid for both league and tournament victory. The series has always featured real-life clubs and players adding a degree of authenticity to how well certain teams and players perform. Features Example of a match being played out on screen As with each new entry into the heldheld series developed by Dynamo Games, Championship Manager 2009 Express expands both the managerial options available to the player and new aesthetic qualities, allowing better ease of control and menu navigation. Individual player training is new to this version and allows users to focus specific training routines on key players to give them a competitive edge in crucial matches, while past installments offered full-team routines only. Like past entries to the series, matches play out in 2D on-screen and can be sped up or slowed down to suit the player's preference. This version allows users to view matches in real-time and change tactics or make substitutions at any time if they feel their current strategies are not working. Board members will influence investment into the player's chosen club. Managers can set themselves targets throughout each season that will affect the level of funds provided by the board. Full promotion and relegation means that managers can be completely relegated out of their chosen league and dropped into the non- leagues or, if the board decides, sacked from their team. Press conferences take players to task for their actions if performance is poor. Users may be put on the spot and asked to explain their managerial decisions.

Since 24 April 2015 he has been Ethiopian Ambassador to Germany. From 2008 to 2013 he was mayor of Addis Ababa; previous positions include President of the Oromia Region (1995‚Äì2001), and Minister of Defense (2005‚Äì2008). He was one of the founders, as well as a current member, of the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization (OPDO), which is part of the ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Early life Kuma was born in Gore with the name \\"Taye Teklemariam\\", a town in the Illubabor Zone, the oldest of three children. His father is Wodajo Tokon, a priest, who took the name Teklemariam after baptism; his mother is Muluye. He attended the Menelik II Primary School in Bore, despite a daily walk of 12 kilometers to and from school; he attended Haileselassie I Senior Secondary School up to the tenth grade, when the Red Terror closed his school. He then joined the army and was sent to the Jimma Police Training Camp in 1976. Not much is known about his years in the military, and his family had assumed he was dead when he returned to Gore in 1991 with his first wife and their daughter. Other sources claim that he spent several years as a prisoner of war in the Eritrean war, and languished in the Eritrean People's Liberation Front‚Äôs jails in Nakfa. In circumstances that remain murky, Kuma and several other prisoners were released from Eritrean imprisonment to join the Ethiopian Peoples Democratic Movement (which later joined the Tigrean Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) to form the ERDPF) and fight against the Derg in the Ethiopian Civil War.Taye, after given a name \\"Kuma\\" became an ethnic Oromo and joined (found) OPDO. Political career Following the fall of the Derg in 1991, Kuma was appointed as the Minister of Internal Affairs, the security agency of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia, which was dissolved four years later with the founding of the Federal Republic, at which time Kuma Demeska became President of Oromia. However, on 24 July 2001 he was replaced as President of Oromia by Junedin Sado, as well as expelled from the Central Committee. This was part of the fallout of an internal split within the TPLF, senior partner in the ERDPF alliance, which left Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Sebhat Nega and Arkebe Oqubay on the one side, and Tewolde Wolde Mariam, Seeye Abraha and Gebru Asrat on the other. Kuma was remembered as acting as a peacemaker between the two factions. Despite this setback, he was reappointed the Central Committee of the OPDO in 2003, and was also appointed as one of the three state ministers for Capacity Building.Kuma Demeksa Retrieved 19 March 2012.

The opposite wall was to be decorated by Leonardo da Vinci, who was commissioned to depict the Battle of Anghiari.Ross King, Michelangelo And The Pope's Ceiling The two battles were notable medieval Florentine victories. The Battle of Cascina was fought on 28 July 1364 between the troops of Florence and Pisa, resulting in victory of the former. A thousand Pisans were killed and two hundred more were captured. Description Michelangelo never completed the painting, but did produce a complete cartoon of the composition. The cartoon was copied by several artists, the most notable extant copy being by Michelangelo's pupil Sangallo. Some of Michelangelo's preparatory drawings also survive, along with prints of part of the scene by Marcantonio Raimondi. According to Michelangelo's biographer Giorgio Vasari, the original cartoon was deliberately destroyed by Michelangelo's rival Bartolommeo Bandinelli because he was jealous of its fame; this occurred in 1512 upon the return of the Medici. Michelangelo depicted a scene at the beginning of the battle, when the Florentine army was initially taken by surprise in the attack by the Pisans. He depicts Florentine soldiers bathing naked in the river Arno, responding to a trumpet warning of the Pisan attack. As the soldiers emerge from the river and buckle on their armour, they are threatened by shots from the Pisans. Several soldiers look or point toward the Pisan position to the left. One soldier has apparently been hit and fallen back into the river, while others leap energetically into action. By choosing this episode, Michelangelo could depict his favoured topic: the nude male figure in various postures.

Crisanti studied art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome. He began his film career as assistant set designer to Mario Garbuglia by working on the set of The Great War (1959) with Mario Monicelli. His independent debut came with Maciste in Hell (1962) by Riccardo Freda. In 1970, Crisanti met Francesco Rosi, which proved crucial to the success of his career. He later worked on Cinema Paradiso (1988) and A Pure Formality (1994) by Giuseppe Tornatore, which won a David di Donatello Award. Sicily was one of his favourite places, and he recalled the pomp of the 17-century Bourbon period for the set of The Council of Egypt (2002) by Emidio Greco. Crisanti worked on Michelangelo Antonioni's Identification of a Woman (1982), Franzo Zeffirelli's Young Toscanini (1988), Gianni Amelio's The Stolen Children (1992), and Andrei Tarkovsky's Nostalghia (1983). He taught art at Rome's Experimental Cinematography Centre from 1995 until his death, and was president of A.S.C., the Set and Costume Designers Association.

B. Wilson (born May 24, 1954) is an American copywriter and publicist. He majored in film and television at University of California, Los Angeles, and after graduation worked on film marketing campaigns. Wilson is the co- founder of the Golden Raspberry Awards (also known as the Razzies) along with Mo Murphy, an annual ceremony dedicated to \\"honoring\\" the worst in film. In 1981, while hosting a potluck dinner at his house on the night of the Academy Awards, Wilson invited his friends to give impromptu award presentations in his living room. The following year, Los Angeles Daily News covered the event, the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards, and from behind a cardboard podium Wilson announced the Village People feature film Can't Stop the Music as the first Razzie Award for Worst Picture. Attendance doubled at Razzie award ceremonies in the following years, and by the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards the event received coverage from CNN and two major news wires. Wilson has retained an active role in the awards, and is referred to as the \\"Head Razzberry\\". His book The Official Razzie Movie Guide was published in 2005 for the 25th anniversary of the Razzie Awards. Early life and family Wilson grew up in Chicago, Illinois, and moved with his parents to Santa Monica, California, at age 9. Wilson claims that his parents were raised during the Great Depression and \\"movies meant a lot to them.\\" Wilson also stated that he acquired a \\"real sense of the value of movies and an appreciation of them\\" from his parentshttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6392701.stm At a young age he would skip school in order to watch the Academy Awards from the bleachers. He attended University of California, Los Angeles, majoring in film and television. While attending college, he also managed the Fox Theater, Westwood Village. After graduating UCLA, Wilson obtained a position working on marketing campaigns for movies and as a copywriter for a sponsor of the Los Angeles Film Festival, and watched over 200 movies per year in this capacity. In 2005, Wilson stated that he still worked in film marketing, and also worked on film trailers.English 2005, p. 101 His marketing work has included publicity for the Academy Awards: \\"When they found out that I did the Razzies, they looked at me like I was a spy,\\" said Wilson to The Blade. , Wilson lives in Cerritos, California with his wife Barbara. They have one son. Golden Raspberry Awards Wilson traditionally held pot luck dinner parties at his house in Los Angeles on the night of the Academy Awards. In 1981, after the 53rd Academy Awards had completed for the evening, Wilson invited friends to give random award presentations in his living room. The impromptu ceremony was a success, and the following week a press release about his event released by Wilson was picked up by a few local newspapers, including a mention in the Los Angeles Daily News with the headline: \\"Take These Envelopes, Please\\". Wilson decided to formalize the event, after watching a double feature of Can't Stop the Music and Xanadu. He gathered his friends for a pot luck dinner to watch the 53rd Academy Awards, and gave them ballots to vote on worst in film. Wilson stood at a podium made of cardboard in a tacky tuxedo, with a foam ball attached to a broomstick as a fake microphone, and announced Can't Stop the Music as the first Razzie Award for Worst Picture. John Wilson at 28th Golden Raspberry Awards (2008) The term raspberry is used in its irreverent sense, as in \\"blowing a raspberry\\". Wilson commented to the author of Blame It on the Dog: \\"When I registered the term with the Library of Congress in 1980, they asked me, 'Why raspberry? What's the significance of that?' But since then, razz has pretty much permeated the culture. We couldn't have done it without Hollywood's help.\\" Wilson is referred to as \\"Ye Olde Head Razzberry\\".Crouse 2005, p. 208 The ceremony's program is modeled after the Academy Awards, but is \\"deliberately low-end and tacky\\". The awards themselves typically cost US$4.79 each, in the form of a \\"golfball-sized raspberry\\" which sits atop a Super 8 mm film reel; the whole of which is spray-painted gold.Dawson 2006, pp. 48‚Äì50Crouse 2005, p. 103 Approximately three dozen people came to the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards. The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the attendance as the first, and the 3rd awards ceremony had double this number. By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event. Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: \\"We finally figured out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, but if you went the night before, when the press from all over the world are here and they are looking for something to do, it could well catch on,\\" he said to BBC News. Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide was published in 2005 to mark the 25th anniversary of the awards; he had previously authored Everything I Know I Learned at the Movies in 1996.

He was the third son of W≈Çadys≈Çaw, Duke of Opole- Racib√≥rz, by his wife Euphemia, daughter of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic, Duke of Greater Poland. Life Around 1277 Bolko I was named co-ruler of the Duchy of Opole- Racib√≥rz by his father, despite the fact that he was the third child. After Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw's death in 1282, Bolko I and his brother Casimir inherited Opole as co-rulers, while his other two brothers, Mieszko I and Przemys≈Çaw inherited Racib√≥rz also as co-rulers. The common rule between Bolko I and Casimir lasted two years, until 1284, when the formal division was made of their domains. Bolko I retained the main city of Opole and Casimir received Bytom. For unknown reasons, Bolko I chose to follow different politics than his brothers and began a close cooperation with Henry IV Probus, Duke of Wroc≈Çaw. In particular, this was clearly revealed in the long-time conflict between Henry IV and Bishop Thomas II Zaremba: Bolko I actively supported Henry IV's politics (for example, in 1283 the Duke of Opole took part in the Congress of episcopal rulers in Nysa). In 1287, in an ongoing conflict with the Church's secular power, Bolko I made mediation attempts between them and Henry IV prior to a full military victory over the Duke of Wroc≈Çaw. On 30 September 1288 Leszek II the Black, Duke of Krak√≥w and Sandomierz died without issue. The first pretenders to the Krak√≥w throne were initially the Duke of P≈Çock, Boles≈Çaw II and Henry IV Probus. The military assistance of Dukes W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high of Kuyavia and Casimir II of ≈Åƒôczyca initially gave the victory to Boles≈Çaw II. On 26 February 1289, an unexpected Silesian army under the command of Dukes Henry III of G≈Çog√≥w, Przemko of ≈öcinawa and Bolko I of Opole attacked Siewierz, counting on the support of the Governor of Krak√≥w, castellan Sulk the Bear (Su≈Çk z Nied≈∫wiedzia). The extremely bloody battle ended with the defeat of the Silesian troops. Duke Przemko of ≈öcinawa was killed in battle and Bolko I was seriously wounded and captured by W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, who released him one year later after he paid a large ransom. On 23 June 1290, Henry IV Probus died unexpectedly, probably poisoned. In his will, he left his inheritance to Dukes Henry III of G≈Çog√≥w and Przemys≈Ç II of Greater Poland (some historians supported the theory of Thomas Jurek, who believed that Henry IV's true heir over Wroc≈Çaw and Krak√≥w was Bolko I). The Duke of Opole then decided on an alliance with King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. On 17 January 1291 in Olomouc a formal agreement was signed, in which Bolko I, together with Mieszko I and Casimir agreed to fight with his own troops against any enemy of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. With this treaty, homage was also performed to the Bohemian crown; however, it's unknown if that tribute was only to King Wenceslaus II personally, or was extended to his successors (some historians stated that the homage was made one year later, in 1292). In subsequent years Bolko I actively supported the Polish politics of the Bohemian king. In 1292 the Duke of Opole took part in the expedition at Sieradz against W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high. Once again, war with the Duke of Kuyavia started in 1296, when Bolko I supported Henry III of G≈Çog√≥w in his attempt to conquer Greater Poland. The close cooperation between the Bohemian Kingdom and Bolko I soon brought to him a significant increase in international political affairs. In 1297, he took part in the coronation of his protector King Wenceslaus II, and was appointed as a mediator in the conflict between the Church hierarchy of Olomouc and Wroc≈Çaw. One year later (in 1298), the importance of the Duke of Opole reached his apogee, when he was sent to Mainz as a representative of King Wenceslaus II, in the Electors meeting that chose Albert I of Habsburg as a new German King. Later that year, Bolko I supported the expedition against the deposed King Adolf of Nassau. In 1300 Bolko I took part in the trip of Wenceslaus II to Greater and his coronation as King of Poland. Shortly after, the Duke of Opole's faithful services were rewarded when he was appointed Starost of Krak√≥w. The extinction of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty in 1306 broke the existing alliance of Bolko I with the Bohemian Kingdom and began to improve the already significantly tightening relations with his neighbors. Soon after the death of King Wenceslaus II, Bolko I could only obtain Wielu≈Ñ. The Duke of Opole tried to return to the political scene in 1311, at the beginning of the Rebellion of w√≥jt Albert. It's unknown if the Duke heard the complaints of the burghers of Krak√≥w against W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high and appeared in Lesser Poland in April 1312 following his own interests, or just as the new Governor appointed by the new Bohemian King John of Luxembourg. In any event, Bolko I couldn't cope with Wawel castle and soon returned to Opole, where he imprisoned the leader of the rebellion, w√≥jt (Mayor) Albert. In internal politics, Bolko I was known mainly for his extraordinary generosity to the Church. In particular, he supported the Cistercian monastery in Jemielnica, and the Franciscan Church, where he built the chapel of St. Anna. He also made the economic development of his Duchy after granted to many localities German laws (Magdeburg Law). Bolko I died on 14 May 1313 and was buried in the Franciscan church in Opole. Marriage and issue By 1280, Bolko I married a certain Agnes (d. by 1301), whose origins are unknown.Genealogical database by Herbert Stoyan According to some sources, she was probably the daughter of Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg.BOLKO I OPOLSKI. In 1278 the engagement of Agnes, daughter of Margrave Otto III to a son of Duke W. (who probably was W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolski) was approved by King Ottokar II of Bohemia. They had three sons: # Boles≈Çaw the Elder (b. ca. 1293 ‚Äì d. by 1365). # Bolko II (b. bef. 1300 ‚Äì d. 21 June 1356). # Albert (b. aft. 1300 ‚Äì d. by 25 September 1375). On the other hand, the Obituary of the Church of St. Vincent in Wroc≈Çaw showed the existence of a certain \\"Grzymis≈Çawa, Duchess of Opole\\" (Grimizlaua ducissa Opuliensis) who was buried there around 13 September 1286. Her parentage is also unknown, but her name suggests a Russian origin, probably member of the Rurikids.. According to this source, she was Grzymis≈Çawa Vsevolodovna of Belz (b. bef. 1284 - d. 13 September 1302), daughter of Prince Vsevolod III of Belz. Her existence is shown by Baumgarten and others historians, who used secondary sources in support. (source: ). Her title suggests that she maybe was the first wife of Bolko I, or maybe the wife of Mieszko I of Cieszyn, Bolko I's older brother, or even a different person.

JFJ was founded in 1999 in Kingston, Jamaica. The group was co-founded by Jamaican human rights activist Dr. Carolyn Gomes who in 2008 was awarded the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights. The organization is most widely known for providing legal support to hundreds of victims of state abuse in Jamaica and litigation of human rights issues before Jamaican and international tribunals.  Origin  Jamaican for Justice (JFJ) arose out of the Gas Riots of 16 April 1999. On 19 August 1999 four months after the riots, JFJ came into being. On 15 October, it was officially a legal entity. The founders of JFJ saw strong need for a human rights action group to address the frustrations of the Jamaican people and the systemic abuse by the security forces. These frustrations included many instances of alleged corruption in the public sphere, apparent miscarriages of Justice in the judicial system and imbalances in the socio-economic system. Since its formation, JFJ has also developed working relationships with Amnesty International, USAID Jamaica, The Carter Center, Article 21, Street Law, CEJIL and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Notable cases JFJ has represented hundreds of low-income victims of state abuse, leading a number of campaigns in high-profile cases. * Police beating death of twenty-six-year-old Michael Gayle.

(1980). Philadelphia, PA: The Saunders Press. Mature human vocal cords are composed of layered structures which are quite different at the histological level. Histoanatomy of the glottis The glottis is defined as the true vocal folds and the space between them. It is composed of an intermembranous portion or anterior glottis, and an intercartilaginous portion or posterior glottis. The border between the anterior and posterior glottises is defined by an imaginary line drawn across the vocal fold at the tip of the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. The anterior glottis is the primary structure of vocal fold vibration for phonation and the posterior glottis is the widest opening between the vocal folds for respiration. Thus, voice disorders often involve lesions of the anterior glottis. There are gradual changes in stiffness between the pliable vocal fold and hard, hyaline cartilage of the arytenoid. The vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages form a firm framework for the glottis but are made of elastic cartilage at the tip. Therefore, the vocal process of the arytenoid bends at the elastic cartilage portion during adduction and abduction of the vocal folds. Attachments of the vocal fold Larynx showing vocal ligaments The vibratory portion of the vocal fold in the anterior glottis is connected to the thyroid cartilage anteriorly by the macula flava and anterior commissure tendon, or Broyles' ligament. Posteriorly, this vibratory portion is connected to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage by the posterior macula flava. The macula flava in newborn vocal folds is important for the growth and development of the vocal ligament and layered structure of the vocal folds. In the adult, the macula flavae are probably required for metabolism of the extracellular matrices of the vocal fold mucosa, replacing damaged fibers in order to maintain the integrity and elasticity of the vocal fold tissues. Age-related changes in the macula flava influence the fibrous components of the vocal folds and are partially responsible for the differences in the acoustics of the adult and aged voice. Layered structure of the adult vocal fold The histological structure of the vocal fold can be separated into 5Hirano, M., & Bless, D.M. (1993). Videostroboscopic Examination of the Larynx. San Diego CA: Singular Publishing. or 6Sato, K. (2003). Functional Fine Structures of the Human Vocal Fold Mucosa. In Rubin, J.S., Sataloff, R.T., & Korovin, G.S. (Eds.), Diagnosis and Treatment of Voice Disorders (pp. 41-48). Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning. tissues, depending on the source, which can then be grouped into three sections as the cover, the transition, and the body. The cover is composed of the epithelium (mucosa), basal lamina (or basement membrane zone), and the superficial layer of the lamina propria. The transition is composed of the intermediate and deep layers of the lamina propria. The body is composed of the thyroarytenoid muscle. This layered structure of tissues is very important for vibration of the true vocal folds. The coverEpithelium= The free edge of the vibratory portion of the vocal fold, the anterior glottis, is covered with stratified squamous epithelium. This epithelium is five to twenty-five cells thick with the most superficial layer consisting of one to three cells that are lost to abrasion of the vocal folds during the closed phase of vibration. The posterior glottis is covered with pseudostratified ciliated epithelium. On the surfaces of the epithelial cells are microridges and microvilli. Lubrication of the vocal folds through adequate hydration is essential for normal phonation to avoid excessive abrasion, and the microridges and microvilli help to spread and retain a mucous coat on the epithelium. Surgery of the vocal folds can disturb this layer with scar tissue, which can result in the inability of the epithelium to retain an adequate mucous coat, which will in turn impact lubrication of the vocal folds. The epithelium has been described as a thin shell, the purpose of which is to maintain the shape of the vocal fold. =Basal lamina or basement membrane zone (BMZ)= This is transitional tissue composed of two zones, the lamina lucida and lamina densa. The lamina lucida appears as a low density clear zone medial to the epithelial basal cells. The lamina densa has a greater density of filaments and is adjacent to the lamina propria. The basal lamina or BMZ mainly provides physical support to the epithelium through anchoring fibers and is essential for repair of the epithelium. =Superficial layer of the lamina propria= This layer consists of loose fibrous components and extracellular matrices that can be compared to soft gelatin. This layer is also known as Reinke‚Äôs space but it is not a space at all. Like the pleural cavity, it is a potential space. If there really is a space, there is a problem.A. Blanton (Personal Communication, March 11, 2009). The superficial layer of the lamina propria is a structure that vibrates a great deal during phonation, and the viscoelasticity needed to support this vibratory function depends mostly on extracellular matrices. The primary extracellular matrices of the vocal fold cover are reticular, collagenous and elastic fibers, as well as glycoprotein and glycosaminoglycan. These fibers serve as scaffolds for structural maintenance, providing tensile strength and resilience so that the vocal folds may vibrate freely but still retain their shape. The transitionIntermediate and deep layers of the lamina propria= The intermediate layer of the lamina propria is primarily made up of elastic fibers while the deep layer of the lamina propria is primarily made up of collagenous fibers. These fibers run roughly parallel to the vocal fold edge and these two layers of the lamina propria comprise the vocal ligament. The transition layer is primarily structural, giving the vocal fold support as well as providing adhesion between the mucosa, or cover, and the body, the thyroarytenoid muscle.

History The Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute started in 1992 as a research group in the University of Utah School of Computing by Chris Johnson and Rob MacLeod. In 1994 this group became the Center for Scientific Computing and Imaging, and in 2000 the name was changed to the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute. In 2007, the SCI Institute was awarded funding from USTAR to recruit more faculty in medical imaging technology. The SCI Institute was recognized as an NVIDIA CUDA Center of Excellence in 2008. In 2011, USTAR funding allowed faculty recruitment for genomic signal processing and information visualization. in 2014, Intel partnered with the SCI Institute to form the Intel Parallel Computing Center for Scientific Rendering to research and develop large scale and in situ visualization techniques for Intel hardware. Research The overarching research objective of the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute is to conduct application-driven research in the creation of new scientific computing techniques, tools, and systems. Given the proximity and availability of research conducted at the University of Utah School of Medicine, a main application focus is medicine. SCI Institute researchers also apply computational techniques to scientific and engineering sub-specialties, such as fluid dynamics, biomechanics, electrophysiology, bioelectric fields, scientific visualization, parallel computing, inverse problems, and neuroimaging.

The campaign resulted in communist victory. Strategies The nationalists had faced a precarious dilemma in waging the campaign against its communist enemy because of complex situation they had faced, and consequently, made several grave miscalculations which contributed to their eventual failure. =Nationalist miscalculations= Like other nationalist futile attempts to fight guerrilla and insurgency warfare against the communists after being driven off from mainland China, the very first grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government contributed at least equally if not greater than the enemy's political and military pressure to the nationalist defeat in this campaign. The very first strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was identical to the earlier one the nationalist government had made immediately after World War II, when it had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to be deployed into the Japanese-occupied regions of China, and unwilling to let these regions falling into communist hands, the nationalist government ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet government not to surrender to the communists and allowed them to keep their fighting capabilities to \\"maintain order\\" in the Japanese occupied regions by fighting off the communists. This earlier miscalculation resulted in further alienation and resentment to the nationalist government by the local population, which had already blamed the nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders during the war. Half a decade later when the nationalists were driven from mainland China, they had made the similar miscalculation once again in their desperation, this time by enlisting the help of local bandits to fight the communists, and ordering the nationalist troops left behind to join these bandits in the struggle against the communism. However, the bandits were deeply feared and hated by the local populace they plagued for so long, and nationalist troops left behind joining the bandits certainly did not help them win the support of the general population. In fact, it served the exact opposite, strengthening the popular support of their communist enemy. The second grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was also similar to the one the nationalist government had made immediately after World War II, when it attempted to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long with the problem of the exterminating communists together: those warlords allied with Chiang Kai- shek's nationalist government were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet governments once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and those former Japanese puppet government's warlords could still help the nationalists to by holding on to what was under their control and fighting off communists, and they and the communists would both be weakened. Similarly, the bandits the nationalist governments had failed to exterminate were obviously not good candidates for evacuation to Taiwan half a decade later, and using them to fight communists appeared to be the only logical alternative. If the communists were great weakened by the bandits, then it would the nationalists would have easier time in their counterattacks to retake China. If the bandits were defeated, then the nationalists would have easier job to eradicate them later after retaking China. However, just like those warlords, these bandits were only interested in keeping their own power also, and thus did not put any real efforts to fight the communists like some of the nationalists who were dedicated to their political cause. The eradication of bandits by the communist government only strengthened its popular support since previous governments (including the nationalist government itself) dating back from Qing Dynasty had failed to do so. The third grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was similar to the second one, but this one was about its own troops left behind. The nationalist government had faced a dilemma: the highly disciplined troops were in desperate need to defend Taiwan, the last nationalist island sanctuary. The less disciplined second rate and undisciplined third rate troops, both of which mostly consisted of warlords' troop were definitely not suited to be withdrawn to defend the last stand nationalists had made, and they were not given the top priority for evacuation. Instead, they were left behind to fight the communists behind the enemy line, but such move had alienated many of the troops left behind, and it was impossible to expect them to fight their communist enemy with the same kind of dedication like those nationalist agents who believed in their political cause. Compounding the problem, due to the need of bandits' knowledge of local area, they were often rewarded with higher ranks than the nationalist troops left behind. As a result, the former-nationalist regular troops turned guerrilla fighters lacked any willingness to work together with the bandits they once attempted to exterminate, especially when many of the bandits had killed their comrades-in-arms earlier in the battles of eradications / pacifications. Many loyal nationalists were enraged by the fact that they had to serve under the former-enemy they once fought. Similarly, the bandits lacked the similar willingness and attempted to expend those nationalist troops whenever they could in order to save their own skin. The fourth grave strategic miscalculation made by the retreating nationalist government was financial / economical: due to the lack of money, those bandits turned guerrillas were mostly provided with arms, but not sufficient supplies and money. The bandits turned guerrilla had no problem of looting the local population to get what they need, as they had done for decades, which inevitably drove the general popular support further into the communist side. The little financial support provided by the nationalist government was simply not enough to support such guerrilla and insurgency warfare on such a large scale. Another unexpected but disastrous result of the insufficient financial support was that it had greatly eroded the support of the nationalist government within its own ranks. The wealthy landowners and businessmen were the strong supporters of nationalist government and as their properties were confiscated by the communists and redistributed to the poor, their hatred toward the communist government was enough to cause many of them to stay behind voluntarily to fight behind the enemy line. However, the landowners and businessmen were also longtime victims of bandits due to their wealth, and many of them had suffered even more than the general populace who had far less wealth. As these former landowners and businessmen turned guerrilla fighters were ordered to join their former bandits who once threatened, looted, kidnapped and even killed them and their relatives, it was obvious that such cooperation was mostly in name only and could not produce any actual benefits, and the alienation and discontent toward the nationalist government harbored by these once ardent nationalists would only grow greater. Another problem for the nationalists was the strong disagreement among themselves over how to fight the war against their communist enemy. Military professionals preferred to fight a total war, incapacitate the enemy's ability to fight, but this inevitably conflicted with the interest of another faction of strong supporters of the nationalist government: the landowners and businessmen, who joined bandits to oppose such tactic. The reason was that landowners and businessmen supporting and joining the nationalist guerrilla firmly believed that the nationalists would be able to retake mainland China within several years and they would be able to regain their lost lands, businesses, and other properties that were confiscated and redistributed to the poor by the communists. As the nationalist military professionals in the guerrilla suggested and destroyed the production facilities and businesses as part of the total war, the landowners and businessmen would not be able to regain any valuable properties after the return of the nationalist government because those properties had been destroyed. The bandits agreed with the businessmen and landowners to oppose the idea of total war for a different reason: when the properties were destroyed and productivity dropped, they would not be able to loot enough supply to survive. As a result, despite the animosities between the bandits and landowners and businessmen, they were united together in the opposition to the military professional faction of the nationalists. =Communist strategies= In contrast to the nationalists, communists had much simpler but effective strategy because the communists did not have the dilemma the nationalists had, and all they had to do was to eradicate bandits. The job of fighting a counterinsurgency and counter guerrilla war was made much easier for the communists by the grave strategic miscalculations nationalists they had made themselves, and communists exploited these to the maximum for their advantage. As with all other bandit eradication campaigns, the most important communist strategy was to mobilize the entire population to fight the bandits, and furthermore, additional strategies were devised specifically to fit the local situation to fight the bandits. Prelude During its southward thrust against the retreating nationalists in May 1949, the communist 3rd Field Army was already preparing to suppress bandits in the following provinces of China: Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui and Shanghai. Intelligence work on bandits was already in process and by July 1949, there were more than 113,000 bandits and another 10,000 pirates totaling over 700 bands. As the defeated nationalist regular forces scattered, most of them joined bandits to continue their struggle against communist, and the strength of bandits was more than doubled. To eliminate this threat posed by bandits in eastern China, the communist 3rd Field Army deployed a total of nineteen divisions over the next four years to eradicate the bandits, and on August 9, 1949, the official order was given and the full-scale campaign had formally begun, with the concentration in Zhejiang and Anhui for initial phase in the autumn. Order of battle Nationalists *3rd Column of the Defense Ministry *3rd Column of the Jiangsu-Anhui Military Region *National Self- Salvation Army North Fujian Command *8th Column of the Fujian People's Anticommunism Army *Popular Self-defense Army of Zhejiang ‚Äì Fujian ‚Äì Jiangxi Border Region Communists *5 Armies (1st Stage) and 19 Divisions (2nd Stage) of the 3rd Field Army 1st Stage Large scale offensive against bandits begun in the late August, after small scale probing assaults, and by January 1950, over fifty-four thousand bandits were annihilated, along with their major bases in Taihu, and the border region of Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangxi. The large bands of bandits in Jiangsu, northern Anhui and Zhejiang were destroyed. From 1950 onward, the communists targeted Fujian and Zhejiang as the major concentration to eliminate the remaining bandits that survived the major offensives. In Fujian, a total of eight regiments of regular communist forces were deployed, succeeding in destroy the major bandit force under the nationalist command titled National Self-Salvation Army North Fujian Command. On the other fronts, communist forces succeeded in annihilating bandits forces of the 3rd Column of the Defense Ministry and the 3rd Column of the Jiangsu- Anhui Military Region that were active in the regions of Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu and northern Anhui. After the Korean War broke out in June 1950, bandits stepped up their offensives, believing that the communists would be soon defeated by the Americans and the nationalists would return soon under the help of their western allies. The communists adjusted their strategies accordingly by increasing their forces to a total of seven regular divisions, four local garrison divisions, and additional militia units. In Fujian, the communist regular army strength was increased to 50% to twelve regiments from the original eight. In Zhejiang, two divisions of the communist 22nd Army and a division of the communist 23rd Army were deployed in Tiantai (Â§©Âè∞) region, Chuanshan (Á©øÂ±±) and Xiangshan (Ë±°Â±±) peninsulas, where bandit activities were heavy. The communist strategy was to first eradicate bandits in the heartlands, wealth regions, and regions next to the transportation / communication lines, and then those remote and poverty-stricken regions. In November 1950, Mao Zedong ordered that another landing on Kinmen (Quemoy) to be postponed, until bandits in Fujian are completely eradicated. The communist force in the province soon swelled to five divisions and after several months of eradication attempts, over thirty bands of bandits were completely annihilated, including 8th Column of the Fujian People's Anticommunism Army and the Popular Self-defense Army of Zhejiang ‚Äì Fujian ‚Äì Jiangxi Border Region. By June 1951, all major organized bandit guerrillas were completely destroyed when communists succeeded in annihilating over 114,500 bandits. 2nd Stage From June 1951 onward, the communist strategy shifted to eradication of the surviving bandits who managed to escape earlier eradication efforts. With nearly all of the former nationalist forces wiped out in the 1st stage of the campaign, the survivors were mostly bandits with nationalist military advisors and agents, which were not as effective as before, when there were more regular army soldiers in the nationalist guerrillas. The eradication tasks were consequently transferred to the local communist garrison and police force, with the help of local militias, while the communist regular force was withdrawn. Within a year, most of the surviving bandits on the mainland were annihilated. However, the communists faced greater challenges in their struggle against pirates backed by the nationalist government in Taiwan, where communists were forced to deploy regular marines and navy, which was still in their infancy and thus inadequate for naval battles. Instead of challenging the superior nationalist navy that backed the pirates, the communists adopted an alternative strategy by ambushing pirates who landed on the mainland, where the communist force was strong. The tactic proved to be effective and in the month of January 1951 alone, over fifteen hundred pirates in over a hundred twenty bands were annihilated. An additional several hundred pirates were also annihilated in 1951 when the communist navy engaged in fifty-six naval battles against pirates at sea, succeeding in sinking and capturing fifty-two boats and ships from the pirates. Beginning in 1951, communists also begun their island hopping campaign to capture coastal islands and eradicate pirates stationed on these islands. When these islands fell into communist hands, the surviving pirates were forced to withdraw and the communist success in these naval engagements was mainly because its weak naval forces operated under the cover of shore artillery batteries and air cover. The attempt to secure these coast islands took much longer than the fighting on lands, and it was not until the end of 1953 when the communist victory was finally achieved, which concluded the campaign itself. The communists succeeded in annihilating over 246,000 bandits (including over 7,800 pirates), capturing over 400 artillery pieces, over 115,000 small arms and dozens of boats. Outcome Although sharing the common anticommunist goal, the nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare was largely handicapped by the enlistment of bandits, many of whom had fought and killed nationalist troops earlier in the eradication / pacification campaign, and also looted, kidnapped and even killed landlords and business owners, an important faction that supported the nationalist government, but now must united against the common enemy, which is half-hearted at the best. Compounding the problem further with additional differences within the ranks of the nationalist guerrillas themselves, the futile nationalist guerrilla and insurgency warfare against its communist enemy was destined to fail.

Freyd is an extensively published scholar who is best known for her theories of betrayal trauma, DARVO, institutional betrayal, and institutional courage. Freyd is Director, Project on Institutional Courage, Founder, The Center for Institutional Courage, Professor of Psychology at the University of Oregon and principal investigator of the Freyd Dynamics Lab. Freyd is also a Member of the Advisory Committee, 2019‚Äì2023, for the Action Collaborative on Preventing Sexual Harassment in Higher Education, National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. She is also the leader of the Program on Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Sexual Violence at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. Education and employer Freyd received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1979. In 1983 she earned her Ph.D. in Psychology at Stanford University. Freyd was an assistant professor at Cornell University from 1983 to 1987, until she was hired with tenure as an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Oregon in 1987. In 1992, Freyd was promoted to full professor at the University of Oregon. In 2017, Freyd filed suit against the University of Oregon for violating the Equal Pay Act, the Equal Protection Clause, and Title IX during her decades of employment. Freyd's complaint raises important issues regarding the enforcement of federal equality laws in academia, and the pay gap for women in particular. Dozens of women's and civil rights groups have collaborated on amicus briefs, including Equal Rights Advocates, the ACLU Women's Rights Project, the National Women's Law Center, the American Association of University Professors. The case is currently before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Research and theory In the last two decades, Freyd has researched and written extensively on sexual abuse and memory. Freyd's initial empirical discovery of representational momentumhttp://dynamic.uoregon.edu/jjf/articles/freydfinke84.pdf. led to her further explore the relationship between trauma memories and the element of betrayal. Freyd introduced the following original concepts to the trauma literature: Betrayal Trauma, DARVO, Institutional Betrayal, and Institutional Courage. Betrayal trauma is defined as a trauma perpetrated by someone whom the victim is close to and reliant upon for support and survival. In betrayal trauma theory (BTT), a betrayal trauma occurs when people or institutions on which a person relies for protection, resources, and survival violate the trust or well-being of that person. BTT emphasizes the importance of betrayal as a core antecedent of dissociation implicitly aimed to preserve the relationship with the caregiver. BTT suggests that a child who is dependent on their caregiver for support will have a higher need to dissociate traumatic experiences from conscious awareness. DARVO is an acronym used to describe a common strategy of abusers. The abuser may: Deny the abuse ever took place, Attack the victim for attempting to hold the abuser accountable; and claim that they, the abuser, are the real victim in the situation, thus Reversing the Victim and Offender. Institutional betrayal refers to \\"wrongdoings perpetrated by an institution upon individuals dependent on that institution, including failure to prevent or respond supportively to wrongdoings by individuals (e.g. sexual assault) committed within the context of the institution\\". It is an extension of betrayal trauma theory. In a 2013 study, Carly P. Smith and Jennifer Freyd documented the psychological harm caused by institutional betrayal. Freyd and Smith developed the Institutional Betrayal Questionnaire (IBQ), now in its second edition, to measure institutional betrayal across a variety of institutional contexts. Freyd introduced the term institutional courage in 2014, portraying it as the antidote to institutional betrayal. Institutional courage refers to \\"rightdoings\\" by which institutions demonstrate accountability, transparency, and support of individuals who are harmed within the context of the institution. The Freyd Dynamics Lab has identified research-based steps by which institutions can embody institutional courage, including engaging in ongoing education, conducting anonymous surveys, being accountable and open to apology, responding well to disclosures and reports, engaging in self-study, keeping data and policies transparent, and rewarding truth-telling. In a September 2019 article in the Journal of Trauma and Dissociation, Freyd and Smidt emphasize the value of education for organizations that are taking steps toward institutional courage. The authors make a distinction between training (which connotes \\"compliance and a rules- based process\\") and education, which \\"is associated with complex understanding, critical thinking, and the acquisition of knowledge based on empirical research and theory development\\". As it concerns sexual violence (a primary focus of Freyd's research), education is needed to help society understand \\"major aspects of the frequency, consequences, and dynamics of sexual harassment and assault\\". In early 2019, Freyd announced a new research initiative to promote the study of institutional courage. The project supports interdisciplinary research on the interconnected problems of sexual violence, DARVO, and institutional betrayal, as well as ways in which institutional courage can flourish. Freyd describes her current research agenda on institutional betrayal and courage and intention to create a nonprofit organization, The Center for Institutional Courage, on a December 2019 episode of the Human Centered podcast. Freyd describes a vision for the Center for Institutional Courage as ‚Äúroughly equal parts a research center that can nurture new knowledge generation, and an outreach part that applies that knowledge to the world‚Äù. Activism Because of her research on sexual assault and institutional betrayal, Freyd was invited to the White House in 2014 to meet with White House advisors on violence against women, as well as New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, to discuss how her research relates to campus sexual violence. In June 2017, Freyd was invited again to speak at a meeting of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, where she presented on institutional betrayal and sexual harassment in academia. Additionally, in an open essay, entitled \\"Gender Discrimination, Dr. Jennifer Freyd's Lawsuit, & Recommendations for Universities,\\" she underscored the far-reaching consequences of gender discrimination against women in higher education. Freyd's research on sexual violence and institutional betrayal has become increasingly prominent with the rise of the Me Too movement and growing societal awareness of the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault. For example, in an interview with Diane Sawyer in 2017, actress and political activist Ashley Judd referenced DARVO when discussing the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations. More recently, Freyd has focused on ensuring that survivors do not lose their voice in the process of reporting sexual violence. Freyd asserted that since institutions can perpetrate abuse by (1) ignoring survivors' wishes about how their private information is shared when they decide to disclose, and (2) by emphasizing that survivors' information will be passed along without their consent, she proposed that faculty educate colleagues and students about Title IX, sexual violence, and institutional betrayal, as well as provide resources for disrupting a culture of sexual violence and learning how to be a good listener. Freyd has proposed 10 steps by which institutions (including universities) can make progress toward institutional courage, such as encouraging whistleblowing and carrying out assessments of institutional betrayal through anonymous surveys. The Chronicle of Higher Education has covered the ongoing debate at the University of Oregon and the Association of American Universities (AAU). Dozens of scientists have criticized the AAU's proposed campus climate survey, with Freyd as a key player in the scientific debate. Affiliations Freyd is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychological Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Since 2005, she has been the editor of the Journal of Trauma & Dissociation. She also currently serves on the Higher Education Advisory Board, Sexual Health Innovations.

Together they have three children. Around 1990, Freyd severed ties with her parents, stating that a recent therapy had uncovered memories of her father, mathematics professor Peter J. Freyd, abusing her during her childhood. Her parents, Pamela and Peter Freyd, disputed Freyd's claims of sexual assault, and co-founded the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, which has been described as a US \\"advocacy group [...] for people claiming to have been wrongly accused of physical and sexual abuse.\\". Three years after its founding, it had more than 7,500 members. The False Memory Syndrome Foundation was dissolved on December 31, 2019.

The house was situated at 30 rue de Provence, in an English garden between the rue de Provence and the rue de la Victoire. It opened on the rue de Provence with a large gate in the shape of a triumphal arch, in the \\"Medici style\\", at the end of the rue Laffitte, which at the time was called the rue d'Artois. The house was visible from the street at the end of a its drive. There was also a circular central courtyard, with a rock in the centre and a colonnade around the outside. After her death in 1781, Mme Thelusson's eldest son, John Isaac de Thellusson Sorcy (1764‚Äì1828) completed the house. As they were Swiss nationals, the Thellusson family kept ownership of the hotel during the Revolution, but they returned to it only in 1797. After the Thermidorian Reaction, there was a \\"victims' ball\\" in the hotel, for people who had had a close relative guillotined during the Revolution. John Isaac sold the hotel in 1802 to the Prince Joachim Murat, who exchanged it in 1807 with Napoleon Bonaparte for the H√¥tel de l'√âlys√©e, which was renamed the √âlys√©e Palace, as well as one million francs. Napoleon offered the house to Tsar Alexander Ist as the Russian Embassy in France. The tsar stayed there in 1818, and Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo, adviser of the tsar, organized prestigious balls and receptions in the hotel. The house was destroyed in 1826 when the rue Laffitte was extended to the rue de la Victoire.

Food *Gastronomy refer the study of relationship between culture and food. It is often erroneously thought that the term is synonymous with the culinary arts, but in fact this is only a small part of this discipline. Gastronomy is interdisciplinary, related to the fine arts, social sciences, and natural sciences. *A gastropub is a British term for a public house (\\"pub\\") which specializes in high-quality food a step above the more basic \\"pub grub.\\" The name is derived from gastronomy and was coined in 1991 when David Eyre and Mike Belben opened a pub called The Eagle in Clerkenwell, London. They placed an emphasis on the quality of food served, though The Eagle was not the first pub to offer good food. Gastropubs usually have an atmosphere which is relaxed and a focus on offering a particular cuisine prepared as well as it is in the best restaurants. Staying true to the format requires a menu that complements the assortment of beers and wines the gastropub offers. Human anatomy and medicine *Gastroenterology or gastrology is the scientific study of the digestive system and digestive diseases. *Gastroesophageal reflux disease (\\"acid reflux\\") is a common disease of the digestive system in which gastric acid, bile, and/or pancreatic juice flow into the distal esophagus, causing pain (mostly heartburn) and tissue damage. *Gastrocaine is an antacid often taken as a prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal disruption. It is often prescribed with Diclofenac during attacks; Diclofenac reduces inflammation as gastrocaine will prevent the non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug from causing stomach upsets. *The gastrocnemius muscle is a powerful superficial muscle in the back part of the lower human leg (the calf). It runs from its two heads just above the knee to the heel, and is involved in standing and walking. It forms the Achilles tendon with the soleus muscle and some scientists consider both to be the triceps surae, a single muscle. *The gastroduodenal artery is a small blood vessel in the abdomen. It supplies blood to the pylorus, a distal part of the stomach, and the proximal part of the duodenum. It arises from the common hepatic artery and terminates in a bifurcation, when it splits into the right gastro-omental artery and the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. *Gastroduodenostomy is a surgical procedure in which a new connection between the stomach and the duodenum is made. The surgery is usually performed on patients with stomach cancer or a malfunctioning pyloric valve. *Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, marked by fever, diarrhea, and/or vomiting caused by an infectious viral, bacterial, or parasitic pathogen. It usually is of acute onset, normally lasting less than ten days, and is self-limiting. Sometimes it is referred to simply as \\"gastro.\\" It is often referred to as the \\"stomach flu,\\" though it is not related to influenza. If the inflammation is limited to the stomach, the term gastritis is used, and if the small bowel alone is affected, term enteritis is used. *Gastroenterostomy is a surgical procedure in which a new connection between the stomach and the jejunum is made. The operation can sometimes be performed at the same time as a partial gastrectomy. Gastroenterostomy was in the past performed to treat peptic ulcers, but today is usually carried out to enable food to pass directly to the small intestine, bypassing a damaged duodenum. The procedure is becoming less common, due to advances in the treatment of ulcers as well as new drugs. *The gastroepiploic arteries are arteries that supply oxygenated blood to the stomach. The right gastroepiploic artery arises when the gastroduodenal artery bifurcates. The left gastroepiploic artery arises from the splenic artery. The gastroepiploic arteries anastomose to one another on the greater curvature of the stomach. *The gastrointestinal tract or gastrointestinal system is the part of the digestive system that takes in food, digests it to extract energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste: **Gastrointestinal bleeding is any hemorrhage (loss of blood) in the gastrointestinal tract, from the pharynx to the rectum. It has diverse causes, and a medical history, as well as physical examination, generally distinguishes between the main forms. The degree of bleeding can range from nearly undetectable to acute, massive, life- threatening bleeding. Upper endoscopy or colonoscopy are generally considered appropriate to identify the source of bleeding. It may refer to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (hematemesis) or lower gastrointestinal bleeding (melena, hematochezia), as well as arteriovenous malformation). **Gastrointestinal cancer is cancer in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. it may refer to gastrointestinal stromal tumors, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, or anal cancer. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are a rare non-epithelial tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, diagnostically separate from more common forms of bowel cancer and comprising 1 to 3 percent of all gastrointestinal malignancies. Seventy percent occur in the stomach, 20 percent in the small intestine and less than 10 percent in the esophagus. Small tumors are generally benign, especially when cell division rate is slow, but large tumors disseminate to the liver, omentum and peritoneal cavity. They rarely occur in other abdominal organs. **Gastrointestinal inhibitory peptide or gastric inhibitory peptide is a hormone secreted by the K-cells of the duodenum in the gastrointestinal tract. Formerly, it was believed to neutralize stomach acid to protect the small intestine from damage and reduce the rate at which food is transferred through the stomach. However, it was discovered that these effects are only achieved with higher-than normal levels of the hormone, and that these results occur naturally in the body through a similar hormone, secretin. It is now believed that the function of the gastrointestinal inhibitory peptide is to induce insulin secretion after glucose is detected in the small intestine. Because of this discovery, gastrointestinal inhibitory peptide is now called glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. *Gastroparesis *Gastroptosis *Gastroschisis *Gastroscope *Gastroscopy (also called esophagogastroduodenoscopy or upper endoscopy *Gastrostomy *Gastrostomy tube Paleontology *A gastrolith Technology *A gastrobot is a food-power robot.

Shown are the humbucker pickups with individual tone and volume controls (T and V, respectively), 3-way pickup selector switch, tone capacitors that form a passive low-pass filter, the output jack and connections between those components. The top right shows a modification that allows both pickups to have their volumes adjusted independently when the selector switch is in the middle position: the two bottom connections are simply swapped on each volume potentiometer. Guitar wiring refers to the electrical components, and interconnections thereof, inside an electric guitar (and, by extension, other electric instruments like the bass guitar or mandolin). It most commonly consists of pickups, potentiometers to adjust volume and tone, a switch to select between different pickups (if the instrument has more than one), and the output socket. There may be additional controls for specific functions; the most common of these are described below. Electrical components Underside of a 1981 Fender Lead I pickguard, showing the wiring.The following section describes the most common components found inside an electric guitar. =Pickups= Pickups convert the mechanical energy of a vibrating string to an electrical signal, allowing it to be amplified, processed and reproduced. Pickups vary greatly in construction, size, types of materials used, as well as various electrical properties, but are generally divided into two categories ‚Äì single-coil and double-coil (also known as humbucker). =Potentiometers= Potentiometers (often abbreviated as \\"pots\\") can be used to control a variety of functions inside an electric guitar. Most often they function as tone and volume controls, but can also blend two pickups together, attenuate one coil of a humbucker, and so on. Potentiometers are differentiated by their electrical characteristics, of which the following are most important in an electric guitar: * Value ‚Äì the resistance between the two outer lugs. The most common values are 250 kŒ© (for single-coil pickups) and 300‚Äì500 kŒ© (for humbuckers), although values ranging from 50 kŒ© to as high as 1 MŒ© have been used. 25 kŒ© pots are usually used with active electronics. * Taper ‚Äì the ratio of wiper travel to the resistance between the wiper and the outer lugs. Logarithmic pots (also known as \\"log\\" or \\"audio\\" pots, and designated with the letter A) are generally used for volume controls, due to the human ear's response to sound pressure being roughly logarithmic, whereas tone controls can employ both logarithmic and linear pots (designated with the letter B), depending on personal preferences and wiring arrangements. Reverse audio pots are sometimes used for volume controls on left-hand guitars, but this is not widespread due to the relative rarity of such pots. Besides the common pots used for volume and tone controls, a number of specialised types exist: * Push-pull pots ‚Äì these pots incorporate an on-on DPDT switch on the underside of the pot that's actuated by pulling the shaft outwards and pushing it back in (hence the name). The switch is electrically independent from the pot and can be used for a number of functions. * Push-push pots ‚Äì a variation of the above, these pots also incorporate a switch which is activated and deactivated by pushing on the middle of the knob. This is used by Fender in their S-1 Switching System, and unlike push-pull pots, requires a special knob. * No-load pots ‚Äì also used by Fender, these pots have the clockwise lug disconnected from the resistive strip within, resulting in infinite resistance between the wiper and the other outer lug when turned fully clockwise. These are sometimes used as tone controls, to remove the load on the pickup(s) presented by the pot and the tone capacitor when turned to 10. * Dual-gang pots ‚Äì these are simply two pots stacked together, either with concentric shafts, allowing the independent control of two different parameters, or with a common shaft. The latter type can be used for blending the signals of two pickups together, and they usually feature a detent in the centre position. =Capacitors= Capacitors (often referred to as \\"caps\\") have several uses in electric guitars, the most common of which is in the tone control, where it combines with the potentiometer to form a low-pass filter, shorting all frequencies above the adjustable cut-off frequency to ground. Another common use is a small capacitor in parallel with the volume control, to prevent the loss of higher frequencies as the volume pot is turned down. This capacitor is commonly known as \\"treble bleed cap\\" and is sometimes accompanied by a series or parallel resistor to limit the amount of treble being retained and match it to the pot's taper. A different take on the standard tone control is the Varitone circuit sometimes used on Gibson guitars (such as the Blueshawk). The Varitone is actually a variable notch filter consisting of one of several capacitors (selected with a rotary switch) in series with an inductor, forming an LC circuit. When placed between the signal and ground, this circuit starts to attenuate frequencies around its resonant frequency, as determined by the following formula: ::f = { \\\\omega \\\\over 2 \\\\pi } = {1 \\\\over {2 \\\\pi \\\\sqrt{LC}}} While this control is not very common in guitars, a number of aftermarket versions are available, both with and without an inductor (the latter being a simple low-pass filter with a movable cutoff frequency). Capacitors used in electric guitars are differentiated by the following electrical characteristics: * Capacitance ‚Äì the amount of electrical energy the capacitor can store. Capacitors used for the tone circuit are usually in the 10‚Äì50 nF range, while treble bleed caps are smaller, usually 1‚Äì2 nF. * Type ‚Äì the dielectric used in the capacitor. Polyester and polypropylene are most common, with ceramic capacitors also being popular, especially in lower-end instruments. Reissues of vintage instruments often use reproductions of vintage paper capacitors, which are also popular aftermarket replacements. Finally, audiophile-grade polypropylene film and foil capacitors are sometimes used in custom instruments, although their size can prove problematic as they're designed for use in audio amplifiers and consequently have working voltages in excess of 500 V, far higher than anything encountered inside an electric guitar. Custom wiring modifications There are countless ways to modify the wiring of an electric guitar. Some of the more popular modifications are described below. =Coil splitting= A humbucker pickup is electrically equivalent to two single-coil pickups wired together in series. Coil splitting involves shorting one of the coils to ground, essentially turning the humbucker into a single-coil pickup (not a perfect replica, though, as the magnetic circuits of the two pickup types are different). This is usually done with a DPDT switch, but can also be done with a push-pull pot. Some manufacturers have used a pot to vary the amount of signal shorted to ground from one coil, thus producing a range of tones between a humbucker and a single-coil. Coil splitting results in a sound that's brighter and has less output than a full humbucker. It also eliminates the humbucker's noise- cancelling properties. This modification requires the start and end of both coils to be exposed, which is more commonly available on aftermarket than stock pickups. A diagram showing a wiring modification for a Les Paul or a similar electric guitar with two humbuckers. Wiring schemes using four push- pull pots for additional pickup combinations were made popular by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page and later produced as a signature model by Gibson. The modification shown in this diagram is an evolution of the original concept combining coil splitting, phase cancellation and parallel/series switching for a total of 22 different pickup combinations. This modification is commonly (and incorrectly) referred to as \\"coil tap\\", which actually involves bypassing part of a pickup's coil using a tap point on the coil. This also serves to reduce the pickup's output and change its sound, but is found only on single coil pickups (and even then rarely). =Phase cancellation= Another popular modification is to reverse the electric polarity of one of the pickups (or one coil of a dual-coil pickup). When two pickups are selected, this produces a very thin and weak sound, due to phase cancellation between the pickups. The closer the pickups are to each other, the greater the cancellation and thus the weaker and thinner the resulting sound. In case of a humbucker this results in a sound that is so weak as to be almost unusable, as well as the loss of the pickup's hum-cancelling properties (due to the coils being magnetically out-of-phase, but electrically in-phase with each other). A way to increase the usability of the sound acquired this way is to wire a capacitor in series with the pickup that has its electric polarity reversed. This filters out that pickup's lower frequencies and thus preserves the corresponding frequencies from the other pickup. The resulting sound is fuller and stronger, yet still different from the standard in-phase combinations, resembling the sound of a \\"cocked wah\\" (a wah-wah pedal set in a fixed position). The capacitor used for this is usually in the 20‚Äì100 nF range. Unintentional phase cancellation can also occur if a guitar's pickups are wired incorrectly, or if a new pickup installed in the guitar has different magnetic or electric polarity from the one it replaced. To fix this, the pickup's magnetic or electric polarity needs to be reversed (which one exactly depends on the respective polarities of the other pickup(s) and whether or not hum-cancelling combinations are desired). While the latter is usually a small matter of reversing the pickup's hot and ground wires, the former may be more difficult, especially if it requires the magnet(s) to be removed and reinstalled in a different orientation, a process which can damage the pickup and render it unusable if not done carefully. This is the case with most humbuckers. On the other hand, single-coil pickups with magnetic polepieces can simply be repolarised by applying a strong enough external magnetic field. =Parallel/series switching= While most single-coil pickups are wired in parallel with each other, it is possible to wire two or more of them in series, producing a fuller and stronger sound not unlike that of a humbucker. This is a popular modification for instruments with two single-coil pickups like the Fender Telecaster and the Fender Jazz Bass. For the former, special 4-way switches are available to replace the stock 3-way switch and provide a series wiring position. Likewise, the two coils of a humbucker which are wired in series can be connected in parallel. This results in a brighter sound and lower output resembling that of a single-coil pickup. Compared to coil split the sound is usually a bit fuller and the pickup's hum-cancelling properties are retained. Like coil split, wiring a humbucker in parallel requires the start and end of both coils to be accessible, which is sometimes possible with stock pickups. Unlike coil split, it also requires a DPDT switch (coil split only requires a SPDT switch). =Blend potentiometers= Blend potentiometers (essentially two potentiometers ganged on the same shaft) allow blending together two pickups in varying degrees. The operation is the same as in a balance control found in stereo equipment ‚Äì in the middle position (often marked with a detent) both pickups supply their full output, and turning the pot in either direction gradually attenuates one of the pickups while leaving the other at full output. Blend potentiometers are a popular modification to instruments with separate volume controls for pickups, no master volume and/or no pickup selector. For instance, on the Fender Jazz Bass, the dual volume controls can be replaced with blend and master volume controls, to allow the instrument's output level to be adjusted with just one knob while still retaining the various combinations of the two pickups blended together. =Active electronics= While the modifications described above have all been passive (i.e. they don't require an external power source), active electronics considerably increase the number of possible wiring options. These can range from simple preamps that offer a volume boost and buffer the instrument's signal (to prevent loss of higher frequencies in longer cable runs), to multi- band equalisers and more. Enterprising guitarists have even built entire effects processors into guitars, such as the Korg Kaoss Pad. The main downside to active electronics is that they require power to operate. This is most often provided by a 9 V battery, but can also be phantom power from an external source, delivered over the guitar cable.

The book's premise, based on real-world evidence, is that the car carrying Diana, Princess of Wales was in collision with a white Fiat Uno just before it crashed on 31 August 1997. Plot introduction The book is set in Paris where Veronique, after having just split up with her boyfriend, is driving home in her 'little white car' when whilst passing through a tunnel in central Paris is approached at high speed from behind by a large car. She is determined not to let it pass; but it collides with the back of her car and crashes. On seeing the news next morning Veronique realises \\"Oh shit, I killed the princess\\". The remainder of the book tells of Veronique's life and loves before the fateful day, and the efforts to conceal her involvement afterwards.

Part of the credit for this sobriquet can be ascribed to long-standing city ordinances that have restricted the height of buildings in the central city. A more modest skyline, interrupted only by the Eiffel Tower, the Tour Montparnasse, Sacr√©-Coeur, and a few church steeples, lends this city's citizens virtually unfettered access to natural light. Nonetheless, another significant contributor to the feeling of openness in Paris is the vast number of public spaces, both green and paved, interspersed throughout all twenty arrondissements, that afford the citizen the opportunity to escape, if only momentarily, his urban environment and partake of air and light like his cousins in the provinces. The following article (and its accompanying list) concern the public spaces known as squares and places in Paris. The word \\"square\\" In Paris (and, more generally, in France), the English word, \\"square\\", has been borrowed to describe a particular type of public space. Specifically, a Parisian \\"square\\" is a small urban green space that is not large enough to be called a parc (the grassy variety) or a bois (the wooded variety), and it is not sufficiently formal in its plantings to be called a jardin. In the English-speaking world, a Parisian \\"square\\" might be called a vest-pocket park or, simply, a \\"green\\" (as in \\"the village green\\"). However, the French use of the word, \\"square\\", presents some small problems in interpretation because native speakers of English use the same word to mean a notable urban crossroads (like Times Square in New York City) or an urban roundabout (like Trafalgar Square in London), where neither grass nor trees nor flowers are present. Such a public space would be called a place in Paris: as in Place de l'√âtoile or Place des Vosges or Place de Clichy. The French use of the word \\"place\\", ‚Äî‚Äî where, in the USA, the UK, Canada, etc., an English- speaker would use the word \\"square\\", ‚Äî‚Äî follows the pattern established in other European languages: the Spanish use the cognate, \\"plaza\\" (like Madrid's Plaza Mayor); the Germans use \\"platz\\" (Berlin's Potsdamer Platz); the Italians use \\"piazza\\" (Rome's Piazza Navona); etc. So, in summary, the French have \\"squares\\" that might (or, more likely, might not) be called \\"squares\\" in English, and they use the word \\"place\\" to denote what an anglophone would almost certainly call a \\"square\\". Squares and places To make things a bit more complicated, in Paris, a \\"square\\" (small green space) may abut a place (large public square), or a \\"square\\" may, in fact, be contained within a place. The \\"square\\" and the associated place typically have different names. Some examples are: The Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul within the square of the same name facing the Place Franz Liszt *Square des Innocents and Place Joachim du Bellay *Square Marcel Pagnol and Place Henri Bergson *Square des Batignolles and Place Charles Fillion *Square Berlioz and Place Adolphe Max *Square de la Trinit√© and Place d'Estienne-d'Orves *Square Saint-Vincent-de-Paul and Place Franz Liszt *Square Monseigneur Maillet and Place des F√™tes *Square Thomas Jefferson and Place des √âtats-Unis Rarely, the \\"square\\" and its associated place share a name: *Square Ferdinand Brunot and Place Ferdinand Brunot *Square de la Chapelle and Place de la Chapelle Pope John XXIII Square, Paris Finally, there are some pairs (of squares and places) where the name of the square is a bit artificial, but the relationship is, nonetheless, clear: *Square de la place Andr√©-Masson *Square de la place Dauphine *Square de la place de Bitche *Square de la place de la Bataille de Stalingrad *Square de la place de la Nation *Square de la place de la R√©union *Square de la place d'Italie *Square de la place du Commerce *Square de la place √âtienne Pernet *Square de la place Pasdeloup Characteristics of Parisian squares In all Parisian squares, gardens, and parks, you will find areas reserved for children, with playgrounds, sandboxes, see-saws, swings, merry-go-rounds, and the like. Some spaces offer a wider range of activities; some random examples are: toy boats to sail, as well as sulky and go-cart rentals in the Jardin du Luxembourg; ping-pong tables in the Square Emile-Chautemps and the Jardin de l'Observatoire; pony or carriage rides at the Parc Monceau; tennis courts, boules, and croquet at the Jardin du Luxembourg; Guignol marionette puppet shows at the Jardin du Ranelagh; roller skating at the Parc Montsouris; a bee- keeping school at the Jardin du Luxembourg; bandstands featuring spring and summer concerts at the Square du Temple and the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, etc. These open spaces also beckon visitors just to wander and daydream, and many offer lush green lawns for sitting, taking a rest, or perhaps a picnic. One is advised, nonetheless, to watch for signs posted on lawns that are accessible to the public: pelouses autoris√©es (lawns authorized for use) and \\"pelouses au repos\\" (lawns for resting).

This version was designated Yak-104PS. Neither the Yak-30 nor the Yak-32 entered production. Design and development Developed concurrently with the Yak-30, the Yak-32 was a single-seat aircraft designed as both a sporting jet, and a light military ground attack aircraft. The airframe of the Yak-32 was that of the Yak-30, but modified to include only a single seat. Yakovlev had intended to market the aircraft as a sporting jet at a time when no other single-seat jet aircraft were being marketed for civilian use. In fact, it would not be until the introduction of the jet version of the Bede BD-5 in the 1970s that another sport aircraft like the Yak-32 was offered. Even in the 21st century, single- seat sporting jets are rarely offered by manufacturers. The light attack version of the Yak-32 was designated Yak-32Sh, and was planned to include more sophisticated avionics than the Yak-32. It could also carry external fuel and weapons loads, including a ZB-500 or ZB-360 external fuel tank, bombs of up to 500 kg, up to four rocket launchers (the largest being the UB-32/S-5), up to four K-13/R-3S missiles, four ARS-240 rockets, or four AOI-9 or UKP-23 gun pods, each with 250 rounds. On 5 August 1971, one of the Yak-32s was ordered to be equipped with RU19P-300 which has been modified to permit longer inverted flight. The aircraft received the designation Yak-32P. Flight evaluation of the aircraft was just as good as the original Yak-32. Operational history Three Yak-32 prototypes were built in 1960-1961 at the same time as the four prototype Yak-30s trainers. They had callsigns 32, 60 and 70. The aircraft 30 and 70 gave aerobatic demonstrations at the 1961 Aviation Day at Tushino. They went on to set several world class records (their thrust being misreported to the FAI as 800 kg). The ASCC allocated the name \\"Mantis\\" to the Yak-32/Yak-104.

Initially the observatory was dedicated to astrometry, geodetic and meteorological observation and tracking the time. The minor planet 1346 Gotha was named after the city of Gotha in recognition of the observatory. History Planning for the observatory began in 1787 by the court astronomer Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, with the financing of Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. It was based upon the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford, England. The building was divided into five parts, with the central section holding a revolving dome. There were two wings to provide quarters for the staff. During Peter Andreas Hansen's term, the observatory was dismantled and moved to a less exposed location in Gotha. The observatory was closed in 1934. Instruments Meridian Circle, at Gotha Observatory till 1936 Around 1800, the observatory became an international center for astronomy, being the most modern astronomical institute primarily for its instruments. The instruments came from London, England, the standard place to acquire them in the 18th century. These included an eighteen-inch quadrant, a two-foot transit instrument, three Hadley sextants, an achromatic heliometer, a two-foot achromatic refractor, a Gregorian reflector and many clocks. By the start of the nineteenth century improved instrumentation was acquired from Munich, the standard place to acquire them in the 19th century: consisting of a theodolite (Reichenbach, Utzschneider & Liebherr), a different heliometer (Fraunhofer), new mounting, and three-foot meridian circle (Ertel, Utzschneider & Fraunhofer). No spectroscopy or photography was performed at the observatory and the only astrophysical equipment of the observatory was a Z√∂llner photometer.

Early life Wynn was the son of a professor of medicine. Educated at Oundle School, he played rugby union. Wynn read natural sciences and mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge. Wynn was in Germany when Adolf Hitler became Chancellor. He married German communist Lieschen Ostrowski, to enable her to escape Nazi Germany. He returned to England, dissolved his marriage, and moved to Oxford for further study. While at the University of Oxford he joined the Clarendon Club, and met and married Margaret 'Peggy' Moxon, a student and a fellow member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. They married in 1938, and had four children (three sons and a daughter). In the following year, Arthur and Peggy Wynn wrote a study of the financial connections of the Conservative establishment which they published as \\"Tory M.P.\\" It was published in the USA as \\"England's Money Lords\\"; the Wynns published under the pseudonym 'Simon Haxey'. Intending to specialise in trade union law in partnership with Sir Stafford Cripps QC, Wynn studied law at Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar in 1939. During World War II, Wynn worked as a technical specialist on secondment at electronics company A.C. Cossor, working on projects that include IFF radar and advanced navigational aids for RAF Bomber Command. Agent Scott Recruited by Edith Tudor-Hart in 1936, Wynn was the Soviet spy known as \\"Agent Scott\\" of the KGB. Wynn created the less prominent Oxford spy ring, in some sense the University of Oxford \\"counterpart\\" to the Cambridge Five. The name Agent Scott first appeared in Soviet files in October 1936. In the 1998 book The Crown Jewels by writer Nigel West and the former KGB officer Oleg Tsarev, the NKVD London station reported a significant intelligence coup, stating that Edith Tudor-Hart had recruited \\"a second Sohnchen,\\" the code name used for Kim Philby. The memo further stated that \\"in all probabilities, they offer even greater possibilities than the first.\\" During the Stalinist purges, the KGB's London recruiting station was briefly closed, but \\"Agent Scott\\" appears to have maintained contact, and by 1941 he was recruiting additional sources. Spying Recruited to the NKVD's British team, Wynn began sending reports on Oxford members of the Communist Party. These were related to recruitment of spies, of which he listed 25, for which later screening ‚Äì which Wynn himself was subjected to ‚Äì five were considered highly suitable. These included an individual code-named \\"Bunny\\", who has never been identified. The basis of the Oxford spy ring he ran are suspected to have included a former Labour MP, a former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum and an Oxford don. This team Wynn recruited became the basis for the Oxford spy ring. Another Oxford student that Wynn recruited was David Floyd. Floyd joined the British Diplomatic Service and spied for the Russians in Moscow at the UK military mission and the British embassy from 1944 to 1947 and then was posted to Belgrade. Wynn also identified and offered to recruit students from the University of Cambridge and the University of London, but his handlers urged him to be more \\"selective. There should be no mass recruitment.\\" Post-war Moved by a series of post-war coal mining disasters, he switched his attention to mining safety. After the nationalisation of the coal industry in 1948, Wynn became director of mining safety research at the Ministry of Fuel and Power. He was the National Coal Board's scientific member from 1955 to 1965, and then a senior civil servant in Tony Benn's Ministry of Technology until his retirement in 1971. Post-retirement, with his wife he became a prominent medical researcher and social commentator, particularly in the area of nutrition. Their papers were widely published and read, and used by many politicians to advance their own political agenda. Through their publications, the Wynns struck up a friendship with Tory MP Peter Bottomley. Tory leadership hopeful Keith Joseph based a 1975 speech on their published article for the Child Poverty Action Group examining the issue of poverty and single parenthood. Joseph's interpretation of the article lost him the support of Margaret Thatcher, who decided to run for the leadership herself. Public revelations from 1992 The real name of \\"Agent Scott\\" first came to light when the KGB permitted access to its files in 1992. The double life of Wynn was exposed in The Weekly Standard magazine by historians John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr and former KGB officer Alexander Vassiliev. The KGB refused to divulge \\"Agent Scott\\"'s name in 1992, prompting media speculation of a series of moles. When the KGB confirmed the existence of \\"Agent Scott\\" in 1996, the mole was incorrectly described as an Old Etonian, a Scotsman and a member of the Foreign Office: Wynn was none of these. Those accused of being \\"Agent Scott\\" therefore included former diplomat Sir David Scott Fox and Sir Peter Wilson, the former chairman of Sotheby's. From information uncovered by Vassiliev, a memo dated July 1941 from Pavel Fitin, the KGB's war time head of counter-intelligence, to KGB chief Vsevolod Merkulov, named \\"Agent Scott\\" as Wynn. It also identified \\"Scott's\\" recruiters as London based NKVD controller Theodore Maly, and Austrian-born spy Edith Tudor-Hart, who also recruited Kim Philby: Personal life Arthur Wynn died in London in 2001. Wynn is the grandfather of the historian and author Adam Tooze. Tooze's book, The Wages of Destruction (2006), is dedicated to Wynn and his wife, Peggy.

Before European settlers came, the springs were used by the Patwin, Pomo, Wintun and Colusi ‚Äì Native American inhabitants of Northern California‚Äôs Coast Range mountains. According to local lore, wealthy social activist and congressman General John Bidwell was searching for gold in 1863 when one of his men got deathly sick. Local Native Americans told him about powerful waters, later to be known as Wilbur Hot Springs. Bidwell brought his man to the waters where he was miraculously cured. General John Bidwell went back to San Francisco and Chico (where he owned the best known farm in California) and spread the word of these healing waters. Throughout America in the late 19th century, hot springs became very popular among those who could afford to stay at fashionable hot springs resorts ‚Äì and to get there in the first place. Often the journeys were long and arduous ‚Äì and getting to the Colusa County hot springs, soon to be as renowned as Germany‚Äôs Baden-Baden spas, was no exception. However, European settlers became attracted to the Wilbur Hot Springs area because of minerals ‚Äì not in the water, but in the ground ‚Äì first, copper and sulfur, then gold. In 1863, Ezekial Wilbur and Edwin Howell purchased a ranch for $1,500. Formed to mine copper along Sulphur Creek, their partnership was soon disbanded when copper ore proved difficult to treat and decreased in value. Within eight months, Wilbur purchased Howell‚Äôs share of the property for $200, built a wood-frame hotel and announced the opening of ‚ÄòWilbur Hot Sulphur Springs‚Äô in 1865. Later that year, Wilbur Hot Sulphur Springs was sold to Marcus Marcuse of Marysville. Meanwhile, the reputation of the ‚Äúmiraculous cures‚Äù of Sulphur Creek continued to grow. By the 1880s, the European-style health resort built beside the hot springs reached its heyday: Wilbur Springs was known for its scalding hot water springs - ‚Äúunexcelled for certain diseases‚Äù - that boiled up over an area of . To get there, guests would travel on the Southern Pacific Railroad to Williams, then travel to the springs, a four-hour trip by stagecoach. By 1891, however, Wilbur‚Äôs fortunes were in decline due to an absentee owner and a better property at Sulphur Creek Village. A mile down the road, Sulphur Creek featured a resort and mining village - this time for gold. With its ramshackle bathhouses and neglected cabins, there was ‚Äúno hotel worthy of the name‚Äù at Wilbur. In 1909, the place became a U.S. Post Office (in service until 1945) and was used as a way station for the local stagecoach. In 1915, the decrepit cabins were razed and Wilbur‚Äôs then-owner, J. W. Cuthbert, built the existing concrete hotel, which was one of the first poured concrete buildings in California. Through the decades, the property continued to change hands, first to the Barker family (supposedly of Ma and Pa Barker fame) and then to the Sutcliff family. Modern establishment In the 1970s, Dr. Richard Louis Miller became associated with Wilbur. Dr. Miller was a San Francisco psychologist who had left teaching at the University of Michigan in order to study in California with Virginia Satir, the founder of family therapy, and with Fritz Perls, the originator of Gestalt Therapy. Since the late 1960s, Miller had operated a clinic in San Francisco known as the Gestalt Institute for Multiple Psychotherapy. Wanting to relocate his practice to the country to develop a conscious-raising community, he believed intensive psychotherapy in a residential setting would be more effective than short, timed sessions. In 1972, Miller came across Wilbur Hot Springs, which was in terrible shape, badly vandalized and littered with junk. Rusting vehicles and dilapidated buildings were scattered around the property, including the decrepit 20-room bathhouse; and literally tons of old wood, broken glass, burned mattresses and couches, old toilets and other junk littered the land. Miller rented the ‚ÄúRed House‚Äù next door to the hotel and began to live at Wilbur on weekends, where he later rented the hotel for psychology seminars. To address the Herculean task of cleaning up the property, Miller led free Esalen workshops in exchange for two hours‚Äô work per day. The barter system proved effective in cleaning the hotel area so that it could then be fully restored. In addition, the hotel was enlarged with a second floor bunkhouse and a new third floor. Later, an eight-suite passive solar lodge was built into the hill above the hotel. Miller‚Äôs relationship with Wilbur was about to become more permanent: after the Sheriff nailed a foreclosure notice on the front door, Miller attended the foreclosure auction and won the bid for the property. Soon after, Miller and his wife moved to Wilbur full-time, where they lived for seven years. Their daughter Sarana, born at Wilbur in 1975, is now an occasional yoga instructor at the hotel. Miller opened the historic Hot Springs to the public in 1974. Some years later, he implemented his desire of working with patients in the country. In 1981, he started Cokenders Alcohol and Drug program, closing the hotel for one week a month to hold this pioneering, non-institutional treatment program. There at Wilbur until 1990, Dr. Miller detoxified 1,500 seriously addicted, chemically dependent patients using the hot springs‚Äô waters and natural ambiance as healing detoxifying agents - and not one patient required medication or hospitalization during their treatment. In 1999 Dr. Miller bought the adjoining valley consisting of , which had been used for hunting. He placed a conservation easement on the property, thereby limiting development in perpetuity. As a result, Wilbur Hot Springs now has its own nature preserve. Many consider the hot springs a \\"place to slow down\\", but it integrates a series of different routines. It is known for peace and quiet. It has a shared kitchen. The historic turn of the 20th century hotel, campsites on the nature preserve,soakersbible.com and the hot springs are available to everyone for healing and rejuvenation. In March 2014, the main hotel was severely damaged by fire. The resort was temporarily closed for repairs. Climate The K√∂ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \\"Csa\\".

It is located at 285 Spadina Ave. the corner of Spadina Avenue and Dundas Street. The building was erected in 1921 as the Standard Theatre, a venue for live action Yiddish theatre, and was described as the only building in North America built for the purpose of being a Yiddish theatre.http://www.billgladstone.ca/?p=8504 It was designed by Benjamin Brown, one of the city's first Jewish architects, and financed by selling shares to members of the large Jewish community of Kensington Market. The theatre was home to a large number of productions of classic Yiddish works, comedy, and translations such as Shakespeare in Yiddish. It was also a centre of Jewish left-wing political activism. The centre for the activities of the Progressive Arts Club. In 1929 an event commemorating the death of Vladimir Lenin was raided by police. In December 1933, the agitprop play Eight Men Speak about the imprisonment of Canadian Communist leader Tim Buck premiered. The police ordered the play closed and threatened to revoke the theatre's licence if the play was performed again. The theatre remained a centre of Toronto's Jewish community until the building was converted into a mainstream movie cinema known as The Strand, which opened in October 1934.\\"New Strand Theatre To Open Friday Eve.\\", Toronto Star, October 5, 1934, p. 28. In 1941, it became the Victory, a cinema in the Twentieth Century Theatres chain. The theatre consisted of a single stadium seating screen and concession area selling snacks. Stairs from the street level on Spadina took moviegoers to the screen. In 1961 it became the Victory Burlesque, joining the Lux (which had opened in 1959) and the Casino (which has existed since the 1930s) as one of three burlesques in Toronto but by the mid-1960s, the Victory was the sole traditional burlesque in the city. It became an iconic destination, especially for students from the nearby University of Toronto. In its last years, it also featured musical acts such as the New York Dolls, Kiss, Iggy Pop and Rush. Facing competition from adult theaters and modern strip clubs it closed in 1975. The Jewish community had left the area, and Dundas and Spadina was now the centre of Toronto's Chinatown. The Victory was thus sold and subdivided in 1975 into shops on the main floor and a Chinese language cinema upstairs, first named the Golden Harvest under ownership by the iconic Hong Kong cinema and then the Mandarin. This cinema closed in 1994, and the building was renovated and is home to a number of retail stores.

Dalman suggested identifying the site with Kefar Uzziel, mentioned in rabbinical sources and home to one of the 24 priestly families that settled in the Galilee from the 2nd century CE onward, owing to the similar sounding name of the nearby Arab-village, Uzeir (believed to be a corruption of \\"Uzziel\\").

Carroll, a Catholic, is best known because his efforts to hold office in the Protestant-dominated colony (of Maryland) resulted in the disfranchisement of the colony's Catholics. The second son of Irish Catholic parents, Carroll was educated in France as a lawyer before returning to England, where he pursued the first steps in a legal career. Before that career developed, he secured a position as Attorney General of the young colony of Maryland. Its founder George Calvert and his descendants intended it as a refuge for Catholics. Carroll supported Charles Calvert, the colony's Catholic proprietor, in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the Protestant majority from gaining political control over Maryland. Following the overthrow of the Calvert proprietorship and the subsequent exclusion of Catholics from colonial government, Carroll turned his attention to planting, law, business, and various offices in the proprietor's remnant organization. He was the wealthiest man in the colony by the time of his death. In the last years of his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige of political power for Catholics in the colony, but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor John Hart disfranchised them. His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, also wealthy, was the only Catholic signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. Early life and emigration Carroll was the second of four sons born to Daniel Carroll of Aghagurty and Littermurna (c. 1642‚Äì1688), a Catholic Irishman whose family lost much of their land and wealth in the English Civil War. The exact place of his birth is unclear, though it likely occurred near the small town of Aghagurty that Carroll's father took as part of his name.Hoffman, pp. 29‚Äì35 Some of the family property near Aghagurty was obtained by a friend, Richard Grace, who made Daniel Carroll the head tenant. This action gave the family a livelihood, but the family continued to have limited means compared to their former status.Hoffman, pp. 34‚Äì35 It is likely that Charles Carroll was fostered by the wealthier Grace, who had no son; his greater resources could provide for the child's education.Hoffman, pp. 36‚Äì37 With Grace's support, Carroll was able to attend school in France‚Äîat Lille and at the University of Douai‚Äîwhere he studied the humanities, philosophy, and civil and canon law.Hoffman, p. 37 By May 1685, Carroll had moved to London, where he registered to study English common law and was accepted into the Inner Temple, one of the four Inns of Court that are able to call members to the bar and enable them to practice law.Hoffman, p. 38 According to family tradition, Carroll secured a position as clerk to William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, an Englishman who was one of two Catholic peers in the court of James II.Hoffman, p. 39 A depiction of the University of Douai in France, where Carroll studied civil and canon law According to Carroll family tradition, Powis told his new clerk that he believed King James was receiving bad advice related to the religious turmoil in England. Powis was concerned about the consequences for English Catholics. He supposedly spoke on Carroll's behalf to an associate of his, Charles Calvert, proprietor of the Maryland colony.McDermott, p. 25 Charles Calvert's grandfather, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, was a former member of Parliament and Secretary of State to James I, whose Catholicism had effectively ended his political career. Intense lobbying by George Calvert had led to the granting of a hereditary charter to the Calvert family. The Maryland colony was established in the 1630s on land granted by this charter. It was intended as a haven for English Catholics and other religious minorities.Krugler, p. 114 Powis may have encouraged Carroll to emigrate to Maryland with the hope that the younger man's career would come to greater fulfillment in a place with less religious conflict than England at the time. Carroll received a commission from Calvert as the colony's Attorney General on July 18, 1688, and arrived in the colony in October 1688. En route, Carroll changed his family motto from In fide et in bello forte (strong in faith and war) to Ubicumque cum libertate (anywhere so long as there be freedom). Soon after he left, the Protestant William of Orange invaded England, James II fled, and Parliament‚Äîwhich had been leery of James' Catholicism‚Äîrecognized William and his wife Mary as the new King and Queen two weeks after Carroll's arrival in Maryland. This event, known as the Glorious Revolution, had profound implications for the future of the Maryland colony and for Carroll.Hoffman, pp. 40‚Äì42 Career and rise to wealth in Maryland Doughoregan Manor, one of the Carroll family homes in Maryland Soon after his arrival in Maryland, Carroll presented his commission to the colony's council and was recognized as the new Attorney General of the colony. He arrived in a place already riven by religious and class differences. Carroll and nearly the entire governing structure of the colony, with the exception of the lower house of the proprietary assembly, were appointed by Calvert. Most of the appointees were Catholic and wealthy, whereas the majority of the population and the lower house of the assembly were Protestant and less wealthy.Hoffman, pp. 41‚Äì42 Carroll arrived in Maryland just as long-standing economic, religious, and political tensions between the poorer Protestant majority and the wealthier and more powerful Catholic minority were reaching a head. By the late 17th century, Maryland's economy was suffering from the effects of price fluctuations on the world market of its main cash crop, tobacco. Often in those years, the price on world markets was barely above the cost of production, leaving planters with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. This growing socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions.Radoff, p. 17 Furthermore, the new Governor, William Joseph, who arrived in the colony just before Carroll, immediately entered into an adversarial relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King James II had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. In an attempt to maintain control in the colony, Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.Radoff, pp. 19‚Äì20 In response to this cancellation and rumors of an anti-Protestant alliance between Catholics and Native Americans, Protestant settlers formed an association to defend themselves. In July 1689, they marched on the colonial capital, St. Mary's City. Led by John Coode, the Protestant associators were quickly able to capture St. Mary's and the other major towns of the colony. The Governor and a number of other Calvert allies fled to Virginia.Lovejoy, pp. 266‚Äì267 Charles Calvert turned for relief to the Lords of Trade and eventually to the Privy Council, but these groups sided with the Protestants and took away the power of the Calvert family to govern the colony.Hoffman, pp. 43‚Äì44 Soon thereafter, the new leaders of the colony barred Catholics from holding office, bearing arms, or serving on juries.Payne, p. 269 Carroll of Maryland During the rebellion, Carroll was recovering from the \\"hard seasoning\\" often experienced by immigrants whose bodies were acclimatizing to local conditions.Hoffman, p. 45 Perhaps due to illness, he chose not to flee the colony. Instead, Carroll offered support and legal advice to Calvert and became an outspoken critic of the Protestant government. He was jailed twice for insulting the new colonial leaders, including Governor Lionel Copley, who accused Carroll of, \\"uttering several mutinous and seditious speeches\\".Hoffman, pp. 45‚Äì46 Losing his position in the colonial government and the ¬£50 annual salary it entailed was a blow to Carroll. His support for Calvert earned him various positions in the private Calvert family organization, which would benefit him throughout his life.Hoffman, p. 46 =Marriage= Carroll improved his fortunes through a judicious marriage. In November 1689, he wed Martha Ridgely Underwood, a widow whose two former husbands had left her a small fortune. Carroll inherited a portion of this fortune after Martha's death in 1690 in childbirth.Hoffman, pp. 64‚Äì65 The child, named Anthony in honor of Carroll's brother, also died.Hoffman, Appendix 6: Genealogical Charts Restricted in his law practice by the new Protestant government, Carroll used the inheritance to begin importing goods to the colony.Hoffman, p. 65 He also purchased a store in the town of Annapolis.McDermott, p. 29 Mary Darnall Carroll, second wife of Charles Carroll and one means to his fortune In February 1693 or 1694, Carroll remarried, this time to the 15-year-old daughter of Colonel Henry Darnall, Charles Calvert's chief agent in the colony.Hoffman, p. 67 The marriage to Mary Darnall secured Carroll a tract of land in Prince George's County, a position in the colony's land office with a ¬£100 annual salary, and a lifelong alliance with Henry Darnall. This tract of land was the first part of what would become a vast empire of nearly by the time of Carroll's death, worth approximately ¬£20,000.Hoffman, pp. 70‚Äì72 Some of these lands were worked by the 112 slaves he acquired during his lifetime. This was a very large number of slaves for a Maryland planter in the early colonial period.Hoffman, p. 73 After 1706, Carroll and his family resided on two properties, a town house built in the new colonial capital of Annapolis and the plantation called Dougheregan in modern-day Howard County. =Children= As successful as Carroll was in business, however, he and his wife experienced many personal losses throughout this period. Of the ten children born to Charles and Mary Carroll, five died within a year of their birth. Henry, their eldest son, died the year before his father in 1719, at the age of 21 or 22. Only the third child, named Charles and later known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, and their next son Daniel would marry and have children of their own. Henry Darnall died in 1711. Carroll took over Darnall's positions as agent and receiver general for the Calvert family in the colony, both posts with significant additional salaries. Among the many uses to which he put this money was lending. After 1713, he became the largest mortgage lender in the colony, and made a number of large personal loans to other planters.Hoffman, p. 73‚Äì75 Carroll continued to practice law, making a small income from cases argued in the two courts where Catholics were still allowed to practice law, the chancery and prerogative courts.Hoffman, p. 75 His speculation in mercantile enterprises also continued. Together, these made Carroll the wealthiest man in the colony by 1715, and its most prominent Catholic.Hoffman, pp. 76‚Äì77 Final attempt at political power and death Benedict Calvert, whose restored proprietorship over Maryland did not bring the religious tolerance for which Charles Carroll had hoped In 1715, political power over the Maryland colony was restored to the Calvert family after the conversion of Benedict Calvert to Protestantism. Emboldened by this turn of events, and with support from a number of prominent Maryland Catholic families, Carroll attempted to gain government office in the state. This would have been a profound departure from the policy of excluding Catholics from government, which had existed since the Protestant takeover in 1689. Carroll's chief antagonist in this effort was the Governor, John Hart.Hoffman, pp. 79‚Äì80 In 1716, Hart discovered that Carroll was planning to travel to England to lobby Calvert's officials for restoration of office-holding rights for Catholics, something Hart vehemently opposed. Hart described Carroll as: > a professed Papist, and the first fomentor of our late Disturbances, who > having acquired a large estate in the Province by the offices he formerly > employed, and his practice in Law...must needs add the Ambition of Rule to > his former Felicity.Andrews, p.226 Carroll travelled to England to press his case, although Hart later claimed that he had been promised no such lobbying would take place. Carroll convinced the proprietor's officials to appoint him as the proprietor's chief agent in the colony.The proprietor was underage at the time and the colony was managed with the help of a council of family officials. He was further appointed to the positions of receiver general, escheator, and naval officer. These positions together effectively gave Carroll the power to oversee all money in the colony that was collected by the government or by Calvert's private organization.Hoffman, pp. 82‚Äì84 Upon Carroll's return to Maryland, Hart was incensed both at the threat to his own power and the idea of a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration confirming the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief.Hoffman, pp. 84‚Äì86 Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined when he came to the defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony.McDermott, p. 30 The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717.Hoffman, pp. 89‚Äì91 According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.Hoffman, p. 94 Carroll died only two years later, with his wealth intact but having failed to regain any political rights for Catholics in Maryland. Carroll's eldest son Henry had died a year before; the family fortune and burden of heading a Catholic family in Protestant-dominated Maryland were passed on to his younger sons Charles and Daniel.Hoffman, pp. 95‚Äì97 Carroll's descendants continued to play a prominent role in the colony. His son Charles, known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, maintained and expanded the family fortune. His grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, achieved the restoration of political rights his grandfather had desired. He became the only Catholic to sign the Declaration of Independence.Radoff, p. 28 and Hoffman, p. 309 See also * Carroll family * Colonial families of Maryland NotesReferences   * Category:1661 births Category:1720 deaths Category:Kingdom of Ireland emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies Category:American Roman Catholics Charles Category:Colonial politicians from Maryland Category:University of Douai alumni Category:American slave owners ","title":"Charles Carroll the Settler"},{"id":"22781634","text":"Otto of the Silver Hand is a children's novel about the Middle Ages written and illustrated by Howard Pyle. It was first published in 1888 by Charles Scribner's Sons. The novel was one of the first written for young readers that went beyond the chivalric ideals of the time period, and showed how cruel the time period could really be. The novel is set in 13th-century Germany, partly during the Great Interregnum and partly during the reign of Rudolph of Habsburg. Plot summary The book centers upon the life of Otto, the son of German warlord Baron Conrad. Otto's mother, Baroness Matilda, has died in premature labour, brought on by the sight of the Baron's battle wounds, prompting Conrad to take his newborn son to be raised in a nearby monastery. When Otto reaches the age of eleven his father returns to claim him from the gentle monks, taking him back to live in Castle Drachenhausen, (\\"Dragons' House\\", in German) the ancestral mountaintop fortress from which the Baron launches his attacks. Here Otto learns of and is horrified by his father's life as a robber baron. Otto is particularly horrified by the revelation of how Conrad killed a defeated, surrendering enemy, Baron Frederick. A rival robber baron, Baron Frederick had been with his men defending a column of merchants in return for the tribute they were paying him. Shortly thereafter, Baron Conrad obeys a summons to the Imperial Court, taking the vast majority of his men-at-arms with him as an impressive escort but leaving Castle Drachenhausen practically undefended as a result. The late Baron Frederick's heir, his nephew Baron Henry, then attacks the castle and burns it to the ground. Baron Henry then takes Otto captive to his own fortress, Castle Trutzdrachen (\\"Dragon-scorner,\\" in German). In the dungeon of his castle, Baron Henry explains to Otto that he has sworn a solemn oath that any member of Baron Conrad's House who fell into his hands would never be able to strike a blow like the one which killed his uncle, Baron Frederick. Because Otto is so young, the Baron keeps this oath by cutting off his right hand instead of killing him, and as an afterthought has a healer sent to tend to him. While Otto is feverish from the pain of his wound, he is comforted by Baron Henry's eight-year-old daughter Pauline, who visits his cell. Otto's father Baron Conrad then returns and rescues him with the help of a few remaining loyal followers. Baron Henry and his men give chase and Otto's father kills Baron Henry in single combat but dies in the process, choosing to sacrifice his life so that his son can escape. Otto flees to the monastery where he grew up and is given refuge there. After Otto regains his health the Abbot accompanies him to an audience with the Emperor, who promises restitution and takes responsibility for Otto's future upbringing. Otto becomes a respected statesman, marries his former captor's daughter Pauline, and is known for his wise counsel and peaceful nature. His amputated swordhand is replaced by an artificial and immobile one made of silver. The Emperor has Castle Drachenhausen rebuilt for the couple and over the gatehouse is carved the motto \\"Manus Argentea Quam Manus Ferrea Melior Est\\", which translated from Latin means \\"A hand of silver is better than a hand of iron\\".

Originally incorporated as Interface 21, it was renamed SpringSource in 2008 to better reflect its main business. Over time most of the Spring developers were employed full-time by the company which offered training and consulting services to finance its activities (Spring itself is open source and is freely available to all). The company was then renamed as Spring. Recognizing that the platform of choice for most Spring applications was Apache Tomcat, Spring merged with Covalent on January 29, 2008. Like Spring, Covalent was the financial vehicle supporting some of the developers of Tomcat. Several other acquisitions followed: G2One (the company behind Groovy and Grails), Hyperic (who developed a tool for monitoring Java applications and their environment) and Cloud Foundry (a Platform as a Service provider). As a result, SpringSource employed some of the lead developers and committers of the Apache Tomcat, Apache HTTP Server, Hyperic, Apache Groovy and Grails open source communities. SpringSource was also a participant in the Java Community Process. Using these acquisitions, the company's business expanded beyond support for its application frameworks, Spring and Grails. It could now offer a suite of software products across all three stages of the enterprise Java application life cycle: build (develop), run (deploy), and manage. SpringSource created two commercial, server products specifically aimed at Spring developers. tc Server is a commercial version of Tomcat integrated with Hyperic for deployment and management. dm Server was an OSGi based server which never was commercially viable. After spending millions on development with no result, it was subsequently donated to the Eclipse Foundation as the Virgo project. Both servers came with a number of customer support options. Educational services expanded to offer training for the Spring framework, Apache Tomcat, tc Server and Groovy/Grails through its educational services unit, the SpringSource University and also a number of partner training providers. SpringSource was purchased for $420m by VMware in August 2009, where it was maintained for some time as a separate division within VMware. The commercial products were rebadged as the vFabric Application Suite. Acquisitions continued including RabbitMQ (an open-source AMQP message broker), Redis (an open source, noSQL key-value store) and Gemstone (developer of several data-management products). These products (except redis) also became part of the vFabric product set. In April 2013 VMware, and its parent company EMC Corporation, formally created a joint venture (with GE) called Pivotal Software. All of VMware's application-oriented products, including Spring were transferred to this organization. VMware sold the Gemstone object database products to GemTalk Systems in May 2013. Pivotal ended their sponsorship of Groovy/Grails in March 2015.

Mattern undertook a number of aviation world records, including twice attempting to break the world record for aerial circumnavigation set by Wiley Post and Harold Gatty. Both attempts failed; the second in 1933 resulted in a crash landing and subsequent rescue by Eskimos and Sigizmund Levanevsky in Siberia. In a twist of fate, Mattern would join the search for Levanevsky after he went missing in 1937. Levanevsky was never found. In 1928, Mattern sold an air plane to an oil company in Texas owned by Michael Benedum. Benedum would later become a frequent financial backer of Mattern's flying activities. In 1937, Mattern was hired as the aeronautical director for the Benedum and Tree's oil company. Starting in 1938, Mattern was a Lockheed test pilot on the P-38 Lightning and during the war helped develop the 'Piggyback' two-seat version that significantly reduced training accidents. In 1946 he was diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic with a ruptured blood vessel in his brain (perhaps due to repeated excessive G-forces experienced while demonstrating P-38s) and was unable to fly again because of the condition. After losing his ability to fly, Mattern and his wife became real estate brokers and then operated a travel agency. He also supported the space program, attended three Apollo launches and had his pilot's license carried to the moon aboard Apollo 11.UT Dallas. Guide to the James J. ‚ÄúJimmie‚Äù Mattern Collection.

Personal life James Mattern was born March 8, 1905, in Freeport, Illinois, to Phillip and Caroline (n√©e Kennedy) Mattern. He also had two older brothers and an older sister. Mattern married Della M. in Los Angeles in 1927. He requested a divorce in Chicago, Illinois, in 1937, stating that Della had left him in 1932 and was living in Washington. On May 18, 1937, the day after his divorce was finalized, Mattern was married to Dorothy J. Harvey, a showgirl, at Berwyn Methodist Church.\\"Jimmie Mattern Marries Showgirl\\".

At twenty years old, she was considered the best informed woman of the village, because she worked in a strategic location, the first tavern in the village. On June 6, 1808, in the Battle of Valdepe√±as against Napoleon's troops, there was a lack of sufficient men to defend the village, so she encouraged women to go out and fight. Although Gal√°n is usually depicted armed with a baton, one version has it that she smashed in the heads of the soldiers with her cast-iron stew pan. The other women poured hot water through the windows and boiling hot oil on the road. This battle led, in part, to the French army abandoning the region of la Mancha, which in turn led to the decisive victory for the Spaniards at the Battle of Bail√©n. This town was granted the title \\"very heroic\\". Gal√°n married Bartolom√© Ruiz de Lerma of Valdepe√±as on May 2, 1810, with whom she had two daughters.

Its activities are dedicated to the support, development and preservation of culture in New York City. Its objective once was to enhance German-American relations. History On January 9, 1847, twenty-five men of German heritage founded the Deutscher Liederkranz der Stadt New York, a male singing society that provided a musical and social outlet for German-American men and also sought to perpetuate the tradition of German music, in both the folk and classical traditions. By 1861, the society was invited to sing with the Philharmonic Society Orchestra, and its performances of Wagner excerpts at the Metropolitan Opera House and in Boston and Philadelphia were among the first performances of Wagner in the United States. The Chorus sang at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Ferrucio Busoni performed piano works at this concert and others on the Liederkranz‚Äôs tour. Many well-known musicians have collaborated with the Liederkranz, including Jenny Lind, Victor Herbert, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Raphael Josephi, Lilli Lehmann, Helen Traubel, and Lauritz Melchior. The Club has also feted Engelbert Humperdinck, Richard Strauss, and Siegfried Wagner. Well-known members of the Liederkranz include Carl Schurz and William Steinway, who acted intermittently as President from 1867 until 1896. Conductor Theodore Thomas, music director from 1882 to 1884 and from 1887 to 1888, used the Liederkranz choir in Wagner concerts. Composer Heinrich Z√∂llner was conductor and music director from 1890 to 1898. The organisation was officially renamed to \\"The Liederkranz of the City of New York\\" in 1919. Honorary members have included President Theodore Roosevelt, Walter Damrosch, and Lauritz Melchior. The Liederkranz has been involved in numerous charitable efforts for the benefit of New York City and its institutions, the Quaker Fund for German Relief, the destitute of the Chicago Fire, etc. The Society established the Liederkranz Foundation, Inc. on April 8, 1948 for the purpose of providing support to young singers and musicians to further their careers. In December 1999 the Liederkranz of the City of New York donated its library of music scores and parts, Liederkranz Club and Liederkranz Foundation documents, and related materials to the Fales Library at NYU.

Early life and career Both Carney and Mobley have backgrounds in education, Carney as a basketball coach in area public schools and Mobley at Campbellsville University in Campbellsville, where he supervised theatre arts for more than two decades.\\"Carney to run for representative\\", Central Kentucky News-Journal, January 30, 2008, accessed May 12, 2009 A native of the Yuma/Speck Ridge community, Carney is the son of June Gabehart Carney and the late Don Carney of Elk Horn. His maternal grandparents were the late W.J. \\"Bug\\" Gabehart and the former Irene Eastridge of Casey Creek. His paternal grandparents were Stanley, Jr., and Christine Carney of Columbia, the seat of Adair County. Carney attended elementary school at Knifley and then graduated from Taylor County High School in Campbellsville. In 1991, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Berea College in Berea, with an emphasis in political science. He later earned teacher certification from Campbellsville University and a Master of Arts degree in educational instructional leadership from Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond. Carney was married to the former Jenifer Martin (born May 1, 1968), originally from Springfield. The couple had two sons. He is a member of Living Grace Church. The couple later divorced. Carney, a former coach, teaches social studies at Taylor County High School in Campbellsville while he simultaneously serves in the part-time state legislature. He was previously a social studies teacher and head basketball coach at Washington County High School in Springfield in Washington County. Previously, he worked for five years for the Campbellsville Municipal Water Department. Kentucky House of Representatives In a news release announcing his candidacy, Carney said that he would concentrate his endeavors on public schools, higher education, health care, the infrastructure, and jobs creation. He pledged to build a strong relationship with area state Senators Vernie McGaha, who has since retired, and Dan Kelly. He promised to work to bring several local projects to fruition. Carney said that he would form an advisory team of both Democrats and Republicans from both Adair and Taylor counties. With Mobley's support, Carney won the Republican nomination in May 2008 over two opponents from Campbellsville. He led the primary with 1,925 votes (41.3 percent). Asa James Swan and Russell Montgomery, a former Democrat, trailed with th 1,636 votes (35.1 percent) and 1,097 primary ballots (23.6 percent), respectively. Runoffs are not required for party nominations in Kentucky. In the 2008 general election, Carney defeated Billy Joe Fudge (born April 12, 1951) of Columbia, a replacement Democratic opponent, after the unopposed party nominee, Stephen Doug Mullins (born February 4, 1944) of Campbellsville, withdrew because of health considerations. Carney received 16,105 votes (54.4 percent) to Fudge's 12,263 (41.4 percent). A third candidate polled 1,239 votes (4.2 percent). In the 2017 legislative session, Carney, the chairman of the House Education Committee, obtained passage of his bill to permit charter schools in Kentucky. Republican Governor Matt Bevin is pre-committed to signing the measure into law. Kentucky had been one of only seven states without such institutions but can offer them as early as the fall of 2018. The legislation was opposed by the superintendents in Carney's hometown. While Carney said that he doubts a charter school will be established immediately in Taylor County, he urged that those sections of the state where the demand exists should be allowed this additional educational choice. \\"Each of our local school districts {Taylor and Adair counties] are performing exceptionally well, and I want to congratulate the work that our local school districts have done,\\" Carney added.

History The Commander has its origins with Emerson's CQC-8 or \\"Banana\\" folding fighting knife based on the Bob Taylor Warrior Knife and the Bill Moran ST-23: a knife designed with the blade in line for reverse grip or sabre grip fighting.Dick, Steven (1997).Emerson ES1-M Special OPS Survival Blade, Tactical Knives Magazine. Winter 1997 This knife became popular among the British SAS and the US Navy SEALs,\\"Le CQC-8 d'Emerson Knives\\", CIBLES Magazine, Issue #439,October 2006Guzy, Mark R. (2003)Testimony Before Nevada Assembly Judiciary Committee Minutes of the Meeting of the Nevada Assembly Committee on Judiciary Seventy- Second Session (2003-03-27). Retrieved 2009-05-12 however the SEALs wanted something more aggressive so Emerson developed the SSRT(Silent Sentry Removal tool) model: a larger, hooked blade with a serrated, doubled-edged spine. This blade's profile resembled the horn of a Rhinoceros and its more popular name is the Rhino. The blade folded below the level of the handle scales so the user could not be cut by this extra edge, a small hole drilled through both handle scales and liners allowed the blade to be held in place so it would not open on a parachute jump and cause harm to the operator. Although the knife functioned perfectly in the field, its final design was too specific for the Navy. During this same period, Emerson was working on a SERE (Survival, Escape, Resistance, and Evasion) folding knife for troops at Fort Bragg. When officers from Naval Special Warfare saw this knife they felt that with a few small changes such as the addition of a blade-catcher, it would suit their needs: the final result was dubbed the ES1-M. A civilian version was made and called the ES1-C; this model did not include the blade-catcher. In field- testing it was realized that the blade-catcher would open the knife when drawn from the pocket.Shackleford, Steve (1997). \\"Cutler of Fortune\\", Blade Magazine, October 1997 Emerson modified this design and secured a patent for it in March 1999. This mechanism is known as the Wave and the knife was added to the production line of Emerson's new factory and was called \\"The Commander\\". The Commander was the winner of the Blade Magazine Overall Knife of the Year Award for 1999. The Emerson Commander was the third model manufactured by Emerson Knives, Inc. The earliest run in 1998 is one of the most sought-after production models by collectors, as the majority of the work from waterjet cutting the liners to grinding the blades was performed by hand, by Emerson himself. In 2000, Emerson Knives offered a larger version based on the original size of the ES1-M and called it the \\"Super Commander\\" as well as a 10% downsized version dubbed the \\"Mini Commander\\". The first runs of Super Commanders were made as limited editions for Triple Aught Design (TAD) Gear of San Francisco and featured the company's logo on the reverse side of the blade. In 2005 the Super Commander became a regular model in the company's lineup. In 2006, Emerson released a Commander with a larger clip-point blade and no recurve. This model was specifically made for the hunting market as a skinning knife. Its designation is the CQC-16. In 2009, at the annual Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia, Emerson announced a collaboration with Kershaw Knives to manufacture an automatic version of the Commander. At the 2010 SHOT Show in Las Vegas, NV, Emerson unveiled the UBR Commander, a 10% scaled-up version of the Super Commander. Specifications SSDS (Rhino) The Commander features a recurve shaped blade that is 3.75\\" long and hardened to a Rockwell hardness of 57-59 RC. The handle is 5.0\\" long making the knife 8.75\\" inches in length when opened. The blade steel is Crucible's 154 CM and is .125\\" thick, although CPM S30V steel, ATS-34, Damascus steel, and Titanium with a carbide edge have been used. The butt-end of the knife features a hole for tying a lanyard. Some models are made with partially serrated blades to aid in the cutting of seatbelts or webbing. The handle material of the Commander is composed of two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a double detent as the locking mechanism. The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material were due to its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. The handle's scales are made from black G-10 Fiberglass, although models were made for a few years utilizing green G-10 and limited runs have been made with a desert tan color. A pocket clip held in place by three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear, or MOLLE. Each model is equipped with Emerson's Wave opening mechanism, aside from one-off versions that lacked it. The Wave is a small hook on the spine of the blade designed to catch the edge of a user's pocket. The blade opens as the knife is drawn. The Mini Commander is built to the same specifications except the blade is 3.4\\" in length and 8.0\\" overall. Likewise, the Super Commander has a 4.0\\" blade and is 9.5\\" in overall length. In the media The Commander was featured in the short-lived UPN television series Soldier of Fortune, Inc. and was used by the character of Zak in the 1998 movie The Placebo Effect. The knife is written about in the military and spy novels of Dennis Chalker and Marcus Wynne.

The name also applies to the neighborhood on that hill. Location Mengo is bordered by Old Kampala to the north, Nsambya Hill to the east, Kibuye to the south-east, Ndeeba to the south, Lubaga Hill to the west, and Namirembe Hill to the north-west. This location is approximately , by road, directly south of the central business district of Kampala. The coordinates of Mengo Hill are 0¬∞18'06.0\\"N, 32¬∞33'58.0\\"E (Latitude:0.301667; Longitude:32.566111). The peak of the hill is at above sea level. Overview Mengo Hill is the location of the main palace (known as Lubiri or Mengo Palace) of the Kabaka (King) of the Kingdom of Buganda, a monarchy that dates back almost 800 years. Mengo has been the main palace since it was first constructed in 1885 by Mwanga II of Buganda, the 31st Kabaka of Buganda. Measuring , the palace is ringed by a six-foot brick fence and has a small airstrip within its walls. Mengo Hill has played an important role in Ugandan political and religious history. \\"Mengo\\" is a Luganda word for grinding stones. According to legend, ancient migrant communities from the Ssese Islands who settled on the hill used these stones to grind their food. It is here that the Buganda Agreement of 1900 was signed between the Kabaka of Buganda and British colonial officials establishing the Uganda Protectorate. The history of Mengo Hill is also entwined with that of adjacent Namirembe Hill, the seat of the Anglican Church of Uganda, because of the monarchy's close association with the Church of England. The Bulange, which houses offices for the Kabaka and the Lukiiko (Buganda Parliament), is at the base of Namirembe Hill. The building was constructed between 1953 and 1958 by Muteesa II of Buganda at a cost of US$5 million, which was a colossal sum at that time. Also located on Namirembe Hill is Mengo Hospital, a private, non-profit community hospital administered by the Anglican Church in Uganda. Landmarks Landmarks on Mengo Hill or near the hill include: * The main palace of the King of Buganda, the Lubiri. * Bulange, the Parliament Building of the Buganda Parliament (the Lukiiko). Moved outside of the palace to the adjacent Namirembe Hill, to accommodate the size of a modern building in 1958. The building also houses the offices of the Kabaka of Buganda * The Kabaka's Lake, a man-made lake approximately , for the personal use and enjoyment of the Kabaka; located just outside the main palace entrance. * Mengo Hospital - A 300-bed private hospital, affiliated with the Church of Uganda; located at adjacent Namirembe Hill * The Joint Clinical Research Center - Located adjacent to the palace, the medical research center is housed in the Butikkiro, the former official residence of the Prime Minister of Buganda (Katikkiro).

He reigned twice, once in 1237 and then again from 1239-45.  Sultan of Damascus  In 1237, as-Salih Ismail's brother,Abulafia and McKitterick, p.612. al-Ashraf, the ruler of Damascus died. Ismail succeeded him and two months later, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, al-Kamil, sent forces to besiege the city. Ismail had the suburbs of Damascus burned to prevent the Egyptian forces shelter.Burns, 2005, p.186. On al-Kamil's death his son al-Adil II occupied Damascus after his brother as-Salih Ayyub, the ruler of al-Jazira, revealed his intentions to succeed al-Kamil as sultan in Egypt. Ayyub was invited to take over Damascus by some of the local governors of Syria and accomplished the conquest in December 1238. Initially, Ismail, who was already governor (emir) of Bosra and Baalbek, allied himself with Ayyub. In August 1239, Ayyub began pressuring Ismail to join him at Nablus for the campaign to take over Egypt from al-Adil II. Ismail promised to come as soon as he could equip his forces, but meantime, he would send his son al-Mansur Mahmud with a small contingent.Humphreys, 1977, p.256. Eventually Ayyub began to grow suspicious of Ismail's perceived procrastination and sent a noted physician, Sa'd al-Din al-Dimashqi, to find out what his vassal was doing. Ismail's vizier discovered Ayyub's scheme and secretly forged al-Dimashqi's recordings to mislead Ayyub into thinking Ismail was indeed on his way to Nablus. When he felt ready enough, he requested from Ayyub the return of al-Mansur Mahmud to Baalbek where he would administer affairs while he was absent on the campaign for Egypt. Ayyub complied. Ismail, with the support of the Ayyubids of Kerak, Hama and Homs, captured Damascus from Ayyub in September 1239. Ayyub was abandoned by his troops and taken captive by local Bedouin who transferred him to an- Nasir Dawud's control. This ushered in an era of future rivalry between Ismail and Ayyub. Ayyub eventually ascended to rule the Egypt-based sultanate with Dawud's help, but he soon quarreled with him. Dawud and Ismail had reconciled and decided to establish an alliance with the Crusaders to prevent Ayyub from conquering their territories. In July 1240 during the Barons' Crusade, an agreement was brokered via Theobald I of Navarre, with the Crusaders allying with Damascus against Egypt. The Crusaders would secure the southern border of Palestine from Ayyub, while Ismail was forced to effectively cede all of the land west of the Jordan River that Saladin had gained for the Ayyubids in 1187, including Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Gaza, and Nablus. Ismail also gave up his own fortresses in Hunin, Tiberias, Beaufort, and Safad.Christopher Tyerman. God's War. p. 767. The terms of the treaty provoked outcries and consternation throughout the Arab world, and Muslim imams denounced Ismail because of the loss of Jerusalem.Folda, 2005, p.165.

It was first described in 2008. Description Both sexes have the same body characteristics. The length of the pale yellow-brown, smooth carapace ranges from 1.1 to 1.7 mm. The legs are pale yellow, with the first two pairs darker than the other two. The cylindrical, whitish opisthosoma is 2.3 mm long in the holotype specimen. The tip of the embolus of the male resembles the tip of a hypodermic needle, and the vulva of the female is atrophied.Rezac 2008 Ecology H. sadistica probably exhibits an annual lifecycle. Eggs are laid from March to April. The species is found in woodlands dominated by Quercus calliprinos and pine plantations, and in steppe habitats where Asphodelus is predominant. Traumatic insemination H. sadistica is the first spider species - and the first member of the entire subphylum Chelicerata - found to use traumatic insemination. The males have specialized genital structures at the pedipalps that are adapted to grip the female and inject the sperm, using a structure resembling a hypodermic needle. After positioning himself, the male pierces the female on both sides and injects the sperm directly into the ovaries, resulting in about eight holes in two rows. Consistent with the modified mating behavior, the spermathecae of the female, which normally store received sperm, are weakly developed in this species. Whereas in other spiders the eggs are fertilized only when laid, in this special case fertilization takes place at the moment of insemination, and develop as embryos before being laid.Rezac 2009 This behavior seems to have evolved in order to ensure that the mating male is also the one providing the sperm for the progeny. Spermathecae fertilise the eggs with the sperm of the last mating male. With the adaption of traumatic insemination, the male ensures that his sperm will be used, circumventing this mechanism.BBC News April 30, 2009 Like many other spider species, H. sadistica has elaborated mating rituals preceding the insemination, involving tapping the female, subduing her and wrapping himself around her in order to position himself prior to insemination. Name The species name refers to the seemingly sadistic habit of stabbing the body cavity of the female. NotesReferences * (2008) Description of Harpactea sadistica n. sp.

It was last assigned to Fourth Air Force, based at San Francisco, California. It was inactivated on 31 March 1944. It trained bombardment organizations and personnel. Also flew antisubmarine patrols along the west coast. History In early 1941, the Army Air Forces (AAF) redesignated its geographical air districts in the United States as Air Forces. In the fall of that year, the new air forces were organized into commands, which typically included a bomber command, an interceptor command, an air support command and an air base command. In this reorganization IV Bomber Command was formed at Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona to control the bombardment units of Fourth Air Force in September. The new command drew much of its initial cadre from the 1st Bombardment Wing, which had been stationed there since May. Shortly after the command became organized, the attack on Pearl Harbor caused the command to relocate to move to Hamilton Field and concentrate its efforts on antisubmarine patrols off the southern Pacific coast, reinforcing units of the Western and Northwestern Sea Frontiers of the United States Navy. However, it shortly became apparent that there was little threat from Japanese submarines. and the command shifted its focus to the training of bomber units and crews. Simultaneously, the AAF moved almost all its heavy bomber training in Second Air Force, while Fourth Air Force focused on fighter aircraft, training, so the command did not grow. In the spring of 1944, the AAF reorganized its training units to provide more flexibility in manning, rather than continuing to use rigid table of organization units.Goss, p. 75 In this reorganization, the command was disbanded on 31 March 1944 and its personnel absorbed into the 400th AAF Base Unit (Headquarters, Fourth Air Force).

Serbia's strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many nations. History The territory of present-day Serbia is situated in the central region of Balkan peninsula. It lies on one of the major migration routes connecting the Middle East with central Europe. Traces of human population in this area go back to at least to 400 000 (see Siƒáevo Gorge). Morava-Vardar corridor has seen regular waves of migrations throughout its history. It is one of the probable paths of original human expansion into Europe. This region was home to several important Mesolithic and Paleolithic cultures. Some of the oldest traces of agriculture in Europe are found in this area. Its fertile river valleys are the probable conduit through which agriculture has spread from the Middle East and Asia minor to central Europe. Archeological sites in present-day Serbia contain some of the earliest examples of metallurgy, especially copper processing. During the Bronze Age this area has seen several large migrations of various Indo-European groups, some of whom become permanently settled. During the Iron Age lower Morava valley become a Celto-Thraco-Illyrian interaction zone. The period of prehistory in this area ends with the advance of reliable Greek and later Roman written sources, especially after the area was incorporated into Roman empire as the province of Moesia. =Paleolithic= Paleolithic archeological evidence from the territory of present-day Serbia remain surprisingly scarce. Two skeletons of Mammoths have been found in Serbia, the first in Kikinda in 1996, the second in Viminacium (Kostolac), June 2009, 1,5 million year old (mammuthus meridionalis)NBC News thus one of the oldest mammoths of Europe. A fragment of a human jaw, was found in Siƒáevo (Mala Balanica) and believed to be up to 525,000‚Äì397,000 years old. Many archaeological sites have been destroyed because of floodings. =Mesolithic= Lepenski Vir is a mesolithic archaeological site of the Iron Gates culture, near Donji Milanovac, dating to 7000 BC with the peak of culture in 5300‚Äì4800 BC. Numerous piscine sculptures and peculiar architecture are testimony to a rich social and religious life led by the inhabitants and the high cultural level of these early Europeans. It is assumed that the people of Lepenski Vir culture represent the descendants of the early European population of the Brno-P≈ôedmost hunter gatherer culture from the end of the last ice age. Archeological evidence of human habitation of the surrounding caves dates back to around 20,000 BC. The first settlement on the low plateau dates back to 7000 BC, a time when the climate became significantly warmer. Seven successive settlements were discovered on the Lepenski Vir site, with the remains of 136 residential and sacral buildings dating from 6500 to 5500 BC. Among other finds are the many characteristic sculptures, The sculptures can be separated into two distinct categories, one with simple geometric patterns and the other representing humanoid figures. The latter are the most interesting. All of these figural sculptures were modelled in a naturalistic and strongly expressionistic manner. Only the head and face of the human figures were modelled realistically, with strong brow arches, an elongated nose, and a wide, fish-like mouth. Hair, beard, arms and hands can be seen on some of the figures in a stylized form. Many fish-like features can be noticed. Along with the position which these sculptures had in the house shrine, they suggest a connection with river gods. =Neolithic= 4500‚Äì4000 BC Vinƒça Household deity in clay The Neolithic Starƒçevo and Vinƒça cultures existed in or near Belgrade and dominated the Balkans (as well as parts of Central Europe and Asia Minor) about 8,500 years ago. Some scholars believe that the prehistoric Vinƒça signs represent one of the earliest known forms of Writing systems (dating to 6000‚Äì4000 BC).

This culture has been linked with Proto- Illyrian and Mycenaean Greece. =Iron Age= This period spans over a time from the end of the Bronze Age (start of the Iron Age) until the conquering of the Balkans in 168‚Äì75 BC (Roman Serbia).

They took the strategic hill fort of Singidunum, modern Belgrade and built Taurunum (Zemun). They subjugated most of the tribes that came in their way, Illyrians, West Thracians and Paeonians and were at one time the most powerful tribe of the Balkans. From 141 BC and onwards they are fighting with the Romans, they are defeated in 135 BC, victorious in 118 BC against Sextus Pompey and again in 114 BC against Gaius Porcius Cato and then defeated in 107 BC, but are still holding a significant part of Pannonia. They invade Macedonia with the Dardani and Maedi, coming as far as Delphi, plundering the temple but are eventually defeated and driven across the Danube in 88 BC. There they are subjugated by the Dacians under Burebista in 56‚Äì50 BC, and finally, in 15 BC they are Roman subjects, beginning their Romanization. In parts of Moesia (northeast Serbia) the Celtic Scordisci and Thracians lived besides each other, evident in the archeological findings of pits and treasures, spanning from 3rd to 1st centuries BC.

'Pill' is also a verb for the formation of such balls.\\"Pill.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. Pilling is a surface defect of textiles caused by wear, and is generally considered an undesirable trait. It happens when washing and wearing of fabrics causes loose fibers to begin to push out from the surface of the cloth, and, over time, abrasion causes the fibers to develop into small spherical bundles, anchored to the surface of the fabric by protruding fibers that haven't broken. The textile industry divides pilling into four stages: fuzz formation, entanglement, growth, and wear-off. Pilling normally happens on the parts of clothing that receive the most abrasion in day-to-day wear, such as the collar, cuffs, and around the thighs and rear on trousers. Causes All fabrics pill to some extent, although fibers such as linen and silk pill less than most. The primary drivers of pilling are the physical characteristics of the textile (including both the initial fibre, and the way in which it is processed during manufacturing), the personal habits of the textile's wearer, and the environment in which the textile is used. Fibers such as wool, cotton, polyester, nylon and acrylic have a tendency to pill the most, but wool pilling diminishes over time as non-tenacious wool fibers work themselves free of the fabric and break away, whereas pilling of synthetic textiles is a more serious problem, because the stronger fibers hold on to the pills preventing them from falling off. In general longer fibers pill less than short ones because there are fewer ends of fibers, and because it is harder for the longer fibers to work themselves out of the cloth. Fabrics with a large number of loose fibers have a higher tendency to pill. Also, knitted fabrics tend to pill more than woven fabrics, because of the greater distance between yarn crossings in knitted fabrics than in woven ones. For the same reason, a tightly knitted object will pill less than a loosely knitted one. When a fabric is made of a blend of fibers where one fibre is significantly stronger than the other, pills tend to form as the weaker fibre wears and breaks, and the stronger fibre holds the pills onto the cloth. Preventing Techniques used by the textile industry to avoid pilling include singeing the loose fibers protruding on the surface of textile, and spinning the yarn with a high number of twists per inch. Some fabrics are chemically treated during the manufacturing process in order to reduce their propensity to pill. Polymeric coatings are sometimes applied to bind fibers into the fabric surface and prevent initial fuzz from forming. Polyester and cotton fibers are sometimes modified to be of lower-than-normal strength, which results in pills detaching easily from fabrics, once they are formed. Cellulase enzymes are sometimes used on cotton fabrics during wet processing, which removes loose fibers. Textile authorities say consumers can prevent or postpone pilling of their fabrics by treating them with chemical soil release treatments that make the surface of the fabric more hydrophilic, and by turning clothes inside out before washing them. Washing in laundry detergent containing enzymes will get rid of pills on cotton clothing. Result Pills do not interfere with the functionality of the textile, unless a spot with a lot of pills turns into a hole in the fabric. This is because both pills and holes are caused by the fabric wearing‚Äîa pill is fibre that was in the cloth. After the pill forms the fabric is thinner there, increasing the likelihood that a hole will form. Pilling can seriously compromise a textile's acceptability for consumers, and is the focus of significant industry research. In the textile industry, severity of pilling is objectively evaluated using five parameters: pill number, the mean area of pilling; the total area of pilling; contrast, and density. Before and after shaving. Industry has produced fabric shavers that enable end users to remove pills.

In common usage, the terms are sometimes used rather loosely. About one quarter of fish species shoal all their lives, and about one half shoal for part of their lives. Fish derive many benefits from shoaling behaviour including defence against predators (through better predator detection and by diluting the chance of individual capture), enhanced foraging success, and higher success in finding a mate. It is also likely that fish benefit from shoal membership through increased hydrodynamic efficiency. Fish use many traits to choose shoalmates. Generally they prefer larger shoals, shoalmates of their own species, shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves, healthy fish, and kin (when recognized). The \\"oddity effect\\" posits that any shoal member that stands out in appearance will be preferentially targeted by predators. This may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble themselves. The oddity effect thus tends to homogenize shoals. Overview Underwater video loop of a school of herrings migrating at high speed to their spawning grounds in the Baltic Sea An aggregation of fish is the general term for any collection of fish that have gathered together in some locality. Fish aggregations can be structured or unstructured. An unstructured aggregation might be a group of mixed species and sizes that have gathered randomly near some local resource, such as food or nesting sites. If, in addition, the aggregation comes together in an interactive, social way, they may be said to be shoaling.Pitcher and Parish 1993, page 365. Although shoaling fish can relate to each other in a loose way, with each fish swimming and foraging somewhat independently, they are nonetheless aware of the other members of the group as shown by the way they adjust behaviour such as swimming, so as to remain close to the other fish in the group. Shoaling groups can include fish of disparate sizes and can include mixed-species subgroups. If the shoal becomes more tightly organised, with the fish synchronising their swimming so they all move at the same speed and in the same direction, then the fish may be said to be schooling.Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 375, 1997, Schooling fish are usually of the same species and the same age/size. Fish schools move with the individual members precisely spaced from each other. The schools undertake complicated manoeuvres, as though the schools have minds of their own.Moyle, PB and Cech, JJ (2003) Fishes, An Introduction to Ichthyology. 5th Ed, Benjamin Cummings. The intricacies of schooling are far from fully understood, especially the swimming and feeding energetics. Many hypotheses to explain the function of schooling have been suggested, such as better orientation, synchronized hunting, predator confusion and reduced risk of being found. Schooling also has disadvantages, such as excretion buildup in the breathing media and oxygen and food depletion. The way the fish array in the school probably gives energy saving advantages, though this is controversial.Pitcher, TJ and Parrish, JK (1993) Behaviour of Teleost Fishes, Chp 12: Functions of shoaling behaviour in teleosts Springer. Schools of forage fish often accompany large predator fish. Here a school of jacks accompany a great barracuda. Fish can be obligate or facultative shoalers. Obligate shoalers, such as tunas, herrings and anchovy, spend all of their time shoaling or schooling, and become agitated if separated from the group. Facultative shoalers, such as Atlantic cod, saiths and some carangids, shoal only some of the time, perhaps for reproductive purposes. Shoaling fish can shift into a disciplined and coordinated school, then shift back to an amorphous shoal within seconds. Such shifts are triggered by changes of activity from feeding, resting, travelling or avoiding predators. When schooling fish stop to feed, they break ranks and become shoals. Shoals are more vulnerable to predator attack. The shape a shoal or school takes depends on the type of fish and what the fish are doing. Schools that are travelling can form long thin lines, or squares or ovals or amoeboid shapes. Fast moving schools usually form a wedge shape, while shoals that are feeding tend to become circular. Forage fish are small fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish are small, filter-feeding fish such as herring, anchovies and menhaden. Forage fish compensate for their small size by forming schools. Some swim in synchronised grids with their mouths open so they can efficiently filter feed on plankton. These schools can become huge, moving along coastlines and migrating across open oceans. The shoals are concentrated food resources for the great marine predators. These sometimes immense gatherings fuel the ocean food web. Most forage fish are pelagic fish, which means they form their schools in open water, and not on or near the bottom (demersal fish). Forage fish are short-lived, and go mostly unnoticed by humans. The predators are keenly focused on the shoals, acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations themselves, often in schools of their own, that can span thousands of miles to connect with, or stay connected with them.National Coalition for Marine Conservation: Forage fish A school of fish has many eyes that can scan for food or threats Herring are among the more spectacular schooling fish. They aggregate together in huge numbers. The largest schools are often formed during migrations by merging with smaller schools. \\"Chains\\" of schools one hundred kilometres long have been observed of mullet migrating in the Caspian Sea. Radakov estimated herring schools in the North Atlantic can occupy up to 4.8 cubic kilometres with fish densities between 0.5 and 1.0 fish/cubic metre, totalling about three billion fish in a single school.Radakov DV (1973) Schooling in the ecology of fish. Israel Program for Scientific Translation, translated by Mill H. Halsted Press, New York. These schools move along coastlines and traverse the open oceans. Herring schools in general have very precise arrangements which allow the school to maintain relatively constant cruising speeds. Herrings have excellent hearing, and their schools react very rapidly to a predator. The herrings keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or a cruising predator like a killer whale, forming a vacuole which looks like a doughnut from a spotter plane. Many species of large predatory fish also school, including many highly migratory fish, such as tuna and some oceangoing sharks. Cetaceans such as dolphins, porpoises and whales, operate in organised social groups called pods. \\"Shoaling behaviour is generally described as a trade-off between the anti-predator benefits of living in groups and the costs of increased foraging competition.\\" Landa (1998) argues that the cumulative advantages of shoaling, as elaborated below, are strong selective inducements for fish to join shoals. Parrish et al. (2002) argue similarly that schooling is a classic example of emergence, where there are properties that are possessed by the school but not by the individual fish. Emergent properties give an evolutionary advantage to members of the school which non members do not receive. Social interaction Support for the social and genetic function of aggregations, especially those formed by fish, can be seen in several aspects of their behaviour. For instance, experiments have shown that individual fish removed from a school will have a higher respiratory rate than those found in the school. This effect has been attributed to stress, and the effect of being with conspecifics therefore appears to be a calming one and a powerful social motivation for remaining in an aggregation. Herring, for instance, will become very agitated if they are isolated from conspecifics. Because of their adaptation to schooling behaviour they are rarely displayed in aquaria. Even with the best facilities aquaria can offer they become fragile and sluggish compared to their quivering energy in wild schools. Foraging advantages Some coastal upwellings (red) provide plankton-rich feeding grounds for shoals of forage fish, which in turn attract larger predator fish. It has also been proposed that swimming in groups enhances foraging success. This ability was demonstrated by Pitcher and others in their study of foraging behaviour in shoaling cyprinids. In this study, the time it took for groups of minnows and goldfish to find a patch of food was quantified. The number of fishes in the groups was varied, and a statistically significant decrease in the amount of time necessary for larger groups to find food was established. Further support for an enhanced foraging capability of schools is seen in the structure of schools of predatory fish. Partridge and others analysed the school structure of Atlantic bluefin tuna from aerial photographs and found that the school assumed a parabolic shape, a fact that was suggestive of cooperative hunting in this species. \\"The reason for this is the presence of many eyes searching for the food. Fish in shoals \\"share\\" information by monitoring each other's behaviour closely. Feeding behaviour in one fish quickly stimulates food-searching behaviour in others. Fertile feeding grounds for forage fish are provided by ocean upwellings. Oceanic gyres are large-scale ocean currents caused by the Coriolis effect. Wind- driven surface currents interact with these gyres and the underwater topography, such as seamounts, fishing banks, and the edge of continental shelves, to produce downwellings and upwellings. These can transport nutrients which plankton thrive on. The result can be rich feeding grounds attractive to the plankton feeding forage fish. In turn, the forage fish themselves become a feeding ground for larger predator fish. Most upwellings are coastal, and many of them support some of the most productive fisheries in the world. Regions of notable upwelling include coastal Peru, Chile, Arabian Sea, western South Africa, eastern New Zealand and the California coast. Copepods, the primary zooplankton, are a major item on the forage fish menu. They are a group of small crustaceans found in ocean and freshwater habitats. Copepods are typically one millimetre (0.04 in) to two millimetres (0.08 in) long, with a teardrop shaped body. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet.Biology of Copepods at Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg Copepods are very alert and evasive. They have large antennae (see photo below left). When they spread their antennae they can sense the pressure wave from an approaching fish and jump with great speed over a few centimeters. If copepod concentrations reach high levels, schooling herrings adopt a method called ram feeding. In the photo below, herring ram feed on a school of copepods. They swim with their mouth wide open and their opercula fully expanded. File:Copepodkils.jpgThis copepod has its antenna spread (click to enlarge). The antenna detects the pressure wave of an approaching fish. File:Herring2.jpgCopepods are a major food source for forage fish like this Atlantic herring. File:Herringramkils.jpgSchool of herrings ram-feeding on a school of copepods, with opercula expanded so their red gills are visible File:Synchropredation.gifAnimation showing how herrings hunting in a synchronised way can capture the very alert and evasive copepod The fish swim in a grid where the distance between them is the same as the jump length of their prey, as indicated in the animation above right. In the animation, juvenile herring hunt the copepods in this synchronised way. The copepods sense with their antennae the pressure-wave of an approaching herring and react with a fast escape jump. The length of the jump is fairly constant. The fish align themselves in a grid with this characteristic jump length. A copepod can dart about 80 times before it tires. After a jump, it takes it 60 milliseconds to spread its antennae again, and this time delay becomes its undoing, as the almost endless stream of herrings allows a herring to eventually snap the copepod. A single juvenile herring could never catch a large copepod. Reproductive advantages A third proposed benefit of fish groups is that they serve a reproductive function. They provide increased access to potential mates, since finding a mate in a shoal does not take much energy. And for migrating fish that navigate long distances to spawn, it is likely that the navigation of the shoal, with an input from all the shoal members, will be better than that taken by an individual fish. Migration of Icelandic capelin Forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a particular stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern Norway, their feeding ground in Iceland, and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring. Capelin are a forage fish of the smelt family found in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of plankton at the edge of the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat krill and other crustaceans. The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. The migration is affected by ocean currents. Around Iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January. The diagram on the right shows the main spawning grounds and larval drift routes. Capelin on the way to feeding grounds is coloured green, capelin on the way back is blue, and the breeding grounds are red. Hydrodynamic efficiency This theory states that groups of fish may save energy when swimming together, much in the way that bicyclists may draft one another in a peloton. Geese flying in a Vee formation are also thought to save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Increased efficiencies in swimming in groups have been proposed for schools of fish and Antarctic krill. It would seem reasonable to think that the regular spacing and size uniformity of fish in schools would result in hydrodynamic efficiencies. Laboratory experiments have failed to find any gains from the hydrodynamic lift created by the neighbours of a fish in a school,Pitcher and Parish 1993 though it is thought that efficiency gains do occur in the wild. Landa (1998) argues that the leader of a school constantly changes, because while being in the body of a school gives a hydrodynamic advantage, the leader will be the first to the food. Predator avoidance Schooling predator bluefin trevally size up schooling anchovies Schooling response time in face of predatorAparna, Bhaduri (2011) Mockingbird Tales: Readings in Animal Behavior OpenStax College. It is commonly observed that schooling fish are particularly in danger of being eaten if they are separated from the school. Several anti-predator functions of fish schools have been proposed. One potential method by which fish schools might thwart predators is the \\"predator confusion effect\\" proposed and demonstrated by Milinski and Heller (1978). This theory is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to choose individual prey from groups because the many moving targets create a sensory overload of the predator's visual channel. Milinski and Heller's findings have been corroborated both in experiment and computer simulations. \\"Shoaling fish are the same size and silvery, so it is difficult for a visually oriented predator to pick an individual out of a mass of twisting, flashing fish and then have enough time to grab its prey before it disappears into the shoal.\\" Schooling behaviour confuses the lateral line organ (LLO) as well as the electrosensory system (ESS) of predators. Fin movements of a single fish act as a point-shaped wave source, emitting a gradient by which predators might localize it. Since fields of many fish will overlap, schooling should obscure this gradient, perhaps mimicking pressure waves of a larger animal, and more likely confuse the lateral line perception. The LLO is essential in the final stages of a predator attack. Electro-receptive animals may localize a field source by using spatial non-uniformities. To produce separate signals, individual prey must be about five body widths apart. If objects are too close together to be distinguished, they will form a blurred image. Based on this it was suggested that schooling may confuse the ESS of predators A third potential anti-predator effect of animal aggregations is the \\"many eyes\\" hypothesis. This theory states that as the size of the group increases, the task of scanning the environment for predators can be spread out over many individuals. Not only does this mass collaboration presumably provide a higher level of vigilance, it could also allow more time for individual feeding. A fourth hypothesis for an anti-predatory effect of fish schools is the \\"encounter dilution\\" effect. The dilution effect is an elaboration of safety in numbers, and interacts with the confusion effect. A given predator attack will eat a smaller proportion of a large shoal than a small shoal. Hamilton proposed that animals aggregate because of a \\"selfish\\" avoidance of a predator and was thus a form of cover-seeking. Another formulation of the theory was given by Turner and Pitcher and was viewed as a combination of detection and attack probabilities. In the detection component of the theory, it was suggested that potential prey might benefit by living together since a predator is less likely to chance upon a single group than a scattered distribution. In the attack component, it was thought that an attacking predator is less likely to eat a particular fish when a greater number of fish are present. In sum, a fish has an advantage if it is in the larger of two groups, assuming that the probability of detection and attack does not increase disproportionately with the size of the group. Schooling forage fish are subject to constant attacks by predators. An example is the attacks that take place during the African sardine run. The African sardine run is a spectacular migration by millions of silvery sardines along the southern coastline of Africa. In terms of biomass, the sardine run could rival East Africa's great wildebeest migration. Sardines have a short life-cycle, living only two or three years. Adult sardines, about two years old, mass on the Agulhas Bank where they spawn during spring and summer, releasing tens of thousands of eggs into the water. The adult sardines then make their way in hundreds of shoals towards the sub-tropical waters of the Indian Ocean. A larger shoal might be 7 kilometres (4 mi) long, 1.5 kilometres (1 mi) wide and 30 meters (100 ft) deep. Huge numbers of sharks, dolphins, tuna, sailfish, Cape fur seals and even killer whales congregate and follow the shoals, creating a feeding frenzy along the coastline. A big bait ball swirling around a loose kelp stipe When threatened, sardines (and other forage fish) instinctively group together and create massive bait balls. Bait balls can be up to 20 meters (70 ft) in diameter. They are short lived, seldom lasting longer than 20 minutes. The fish eggs, left behind at the Agulhas Banks, drift north west with the current into waters off the west coast, where the larvae develop into juvenile fish. When they are old enough, they aggregate into dense shoals and migrate southwards, returning to the Agulhas banks to restart the cycle. The development of schooling behavior was probably associated with an increased quality of perception, predatory lifestyle and size sorting mechanisms to avoid cannibalism. In filter-feeding ancestors, before vision and the octavolateralis system (OLS) had developed, the risk of predation would have been limited and mainly due to invertebrate predators. Hence, at that time, safety in numbers was probably not a major incentive for gathering in shoals or schools. The development of vison and the OLS would have permitted detection of potential prey. This could have led to an increased potential for cannibalism within the shoal. On the other hand, increased quality of perception would give small individuals a chance to escape or to never join a shoal with larger fish. It has been shown that small fish avoid joining a group with larger fish, although big fish do not avoid joining small conspecifics. This sorting mechanism based on increased quality of perception could have resulted in homogeneity of size of fish in shoals, which would increase the capacity for moving in synchrony. Predator countermeasures School of blackfin barracuda lined up in attack mode Predators have devised various countermeasures to undermine the defensive shoaling and schooling manoeuvres of forage fish. The sailfish raises its sail to make it appear much larger so it can herd a school of fish or squid. Swordfish charge at high speed through forage fish schools, slashing with their swords to kill or stun prey. They then turn and return to consume their \\"catch\\". Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers swim in circles to drive schooling prey into a compact mass, before striking them sharply with the upper lobe of its tail to stun them.Seitz, J.C. Pelagic Thresher. Florida Museum of Natural History. Retrieved on December 22, 2008. Spinner sharks charge vertically through the school, spinning on their axis with their mouths open and snapping all around. The shark's momentum at the end of these spiralling runs often carries it into the air. File:Istiophorus_platypterus.jpgSailfish herd with their sails. File:Xiphias gladius1.jpgSwordfish slash with their swords. File:Alopias vulpinus.jpgThresher shark strike with their tails. File:Carcharhinus brevipinna.jpgSpinner shark spin on their axis. File:Barrier feeding in bottlenose dolphins.jpg Some predators, such as dolphins, hunt in groups of their own. One technique employed by many dolphin species is herding, where a pod will control a school of fish while individual members take turns ploughing through and feeding on the more tightly-packed school (a formation commonly known as a bait ball.) Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured. In South Carolina, the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin takes this one step further with what has become known as strand feeding, where the fish are driven onto mud banks and retrieved from there.\\"Coastal Stock(s) of Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin: Status Review and Management,\\" Proceedings and Recommendations from a Workshop held in Beaufort, North Carolina, 13 September 1993 ‚Äì 14 September 1993. U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service. pp. 56‚Äì57. Common bottlenose dolphins have been observed using another technique. One dolphin acts as a \\"driver\\" and herds a school of fish towards several other dolphins who form a barrier. The driver dolphin slaps its fluke which makes the fish leap into the air. As the fish leap, the driver dolphin moves with the barrier dolphins and catches the fish in the air. This type of cooperative role specialization seems to be more common in marine animals than in terrestrial animals, perhaps because the oceans have more variability in prey diversity, biomass, and predator mobility. During the sardine run, as many as 18,000 dolphins, behaving like sheepdogs, herd the sardines into bait balls, or corral them in shallow water. Once rounded up, the dolphins and other predators take turns ploughing through the bait balls, gorging on the fish as they sweep through. Seabirds also attack them from above, flocks of gannets, cormorants, terns and gulls. Some of these seabirds plummet from heights of 30 metres (100 feet), plunging through the water leaving vapour-like trails, similar to that of fighter planes. Gannets plunge into the water at up to 100 kilometres per hour (60 mph). They have air sacs under their skin in their face and chest which act like bubble-wrap, cushioning the impact with the water. Subsets of bottlenose dolphin populations in Mauritania are known to engage in interspecific cooperative fishing with human fishermen. The dolphins drive a school of fish towards the shore where humans await with their nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch a large number of fish as well. Intraspecific cooperative foraging techniques have also been observed, and some propose that these behaviours are transmitted through cultural means. Rendell & Whitehead have proposed a structure for the study of culture in cetaceans, Some whales lunge feed on bait balls.Reeves RR, Stewart BS, Clapham PJ and Powell J A (2002) National Audubon Society Guide to Marine Mammals of the World Chanticleer Press. . Lunge feeding is an extreme feeding method, in which the whale accelerates from below a bait ball to a high velocity and then opens its mouth to a large gape angle. This generates the water pressure required to expand its mouth and engulf and filter a huge amount of water and fish. Lunge feeding by the huge rorquals is said to be the largest biomechanical event on Earth. File:Humpback lunge feeding.jpgA pair of humpback whales, a species of rorqual, lunge feeding File:Morus serrator.jpgGannets \\"divebomb\\" at high speed How fish school A \\"tornado\\" of schooling barracudas Fish schools swim in disciplined phalanxes, with some species, such as herrings, able to stream up and down at impressive speeds, twisting this way and that, and making startling changes in the shape of the school, without collisions. It is as if their motions are choreographed, though they are not. There must be very fast response systems to allow the fish to do this. Young fish practice schooling techniques in pairs, and then in larger groups as their techniques and senses mature. The schooling behaviour develops instinctively and is not learnt from older fish. To school the way they do, fish require sensory systems which can respond with great speed to small changes in their position relative to their neighbour. Most schools lose their schooling abilities after dark, and just shoal. This indicates that vision is important to schooling. The importance of vision is also indicated by the behaviour of fish who have been temporarily blinded. Schooling species have eyes on the sides of their heads, which means they can easily see their neighbours. Also, schooling species often have \\"schooling marks\\" on their shoulders or the base of their tails, or visually prominent stripes, which provide reference marks when schooling,Bone Q and Moore RH (2008) Biology of Fishes pp. 418‚Äì422, Taylor & Francis Group. similar in function to passive markers in artificial motion capture. However fish without these markers will still engage in schooling behaviour,BBC News Online, Robofish accepted by wild fish shoal, 09:54 GMT, Thursday, 1 July 2010 10:54 UK though perhaps not as efficiently. Other senses are also used. Pheromones or sound may also play a part but supporting evidence has not been found so far. The lateral line is a line running along each side of the fish from the gill covers to the base of the tail. In laboratory experiments the lateral lines of schooling fish have been removed. They swam closer, leading to a theory that the lateral lines provide additional stimuli input when the fish get too close. The lateral-line system is very sensitive to changes in water currents and vibration in the water. It uses receptors called neuromasts, each of which is composed of a group of hair cells. The hairs are surrounded by a protruding jelly-like cupula, typically 0.1 to 0.2 mm long. The hair cells in the lateral line are similar to the hair cells inside the vertebrate inner ear, indicating that the lateral line and the inner ear share a common origin. Describing shoal structure It is difficult to observe and describe the three dimensional structure of real world fish shoals because of the large number of fish involved. Techniques include the use of recent advances in fisheries acoustics. Parameters defining a fish shoal include: * Shoal size ‚Äì The number of fish in the shoal. A remote sensing technique has been used near the edge of the continental shelf off the east coast of North America to take images of fish shoals. The shoals ‚Äì most likely made up of Atlantic herring, scup, hake, and black sea bass ‚Äì were said to contain ‚Äútens of millions‚Äù of fish and stretched for ‚Äúmany kilometers‚Äù. * Density ‚Äì The density of a fish shoal is the number of fish divided by the volume occupied by the shoal. Density is not necessarily a constant throughout the group. Fish in schools typically have a density of about one fish per cube of body length. File:Jon hanson - schooling bannerfish school (by-sa).jpgLow density File:School of Pterocaesio chrysozona in Papua New Guinea 1.jpgHigh density File:Lutjanus viridis.jpgLow polarity File:Sixfinger threadfin school.jpgHigh polarity * Polarity ‚Äì The group polarity describes the extent to which the fish are all pointing in the same direction. In order to determine this parameter, the average orientation of all animals in the group is determined. For each animal, the angular difference between its orientation and the group orientation is then found. The group polarity is the average of these differences. * Nearest neighbour distance ‚Äì The nearest neighbour distance (NND) describes the distance between the centroid of one fish (the focal fish) and the centroid of the fish nearest to the focal fish. This parameter can be found for each fish in an aggregation and then averaged. Care must be taken to account for the fish located at the edge of a fish aggregation, since these fish have no neighbour in one direction. The NND is also related to the packing density. For schooling fish the NND is usually between one-half and one body length. * Nearest neighbour position ‚Äì In a polar coordinate system, the nearest neighbour position describes the angle and distance of the nearest neighbour to a focal fish. * Packing fraction ‚Äì The packing fraction is a parameter borrowed from physics to define the organization (or state i.e. solid, liquid, or gas) of 3D fish groups. It is an alternative measure to density. In this parameter, the aggregation is idealized as an ensemble of solid spheres, with each fish at the center of a sphere. The packing fraction is defined as the ratio of the total volume occupied by all individual spheres divided by the global volume of the aggregation. Values range from zero to one, where a small packing fraction represents a dilute system like a gas. * Integrated conditional density ‚Äì This parameter measures the density at various length scales and therefore describes the homogeneity of density throughout an animal group. * Pair distribution function ‚Äì This parameter is usually used in physics to characterize the degree of spatial order in a system of particles. It also describes the density, but this measure describes the density at a distance away from a given point. Cavagna et al. found that flocks of starlings exhibited more structure than a gas but less than a liquid. Modelling school behaviourMathematical models= The observational approach is complemented by the mathematical modelling of schools. The most common mathematical models of schools instruct the individual animals to follow three rules: # Move in the same direction as your neighbour # Remain close to your neighbours # Avoid collisions with your neighbours An example of such a simulation is the boids program created by Craig Reynolds in 1986. Another is the self-propelled particle model introduced by Vicsek et al. in 1995 Many current models use variations on these rules. For instance, many models implement these three rules through layered zones around each fish. # In the zone of repulsion very close to the fish, the focal fish will seek to distance itself from its neighbours in order to avoid a collision. # In the slightly further away zone of alignment, a focal fish will seek to align its direction of motion with its neighbours. # In the outmost zone of attraction, which extends as far away from the focal fish as it is able to sense, the focal fish will seek to move towards a neighbour. The shape of these zones will necessarily be affected by the sensory capabilities of the fish. Fish rely on both vision and on hydrodynamic signals relayed through its lateral line. Antarctic krill rely on vision and on hydrodynamic signals relayed through its antennae. In a masters thesis published in 2008, Moshi Charnell produced schooling behaviour without using the alignment matching component of an individuals behaviour.Charnell, M. (2008)\\"Individual-based modelling of ecological systems and social aggregations\\". Download His model reduces the three basic rules to the following two rules: # Remain close to your neighbours # Avoid collisions with your neighbours In a paper published in 2009, researchers from Iceland recount their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around Iceland, successfully predicting the spawning migration route for 2008. =Evolutionary models= In order to gain insight into why animals evolve swarming behaviour, scientists have turned to evolutionary models that simulate populations of evolving animals. Typically these studies use a genetic algorithm to simulate evolution over many generations in the model. These studies have investigated a number of hypotheses explaining why animals evolve swarming behaviour, such as the selfish herd theory, the predator confusion effect, the dilution effect, and the many eyes theory. Mapping the formation of schools In 2009, building on recent advances in acoustic imaging, a group of MIT researchers observed for \\"the first time the formation and subsequent migration of a huge shoal of fish.\\" The results provide the first field confirmation of general theories about how large groups behave, from locust swarms to bird flocks. The researchers imaged spawning Atlantic herring off Georges Bank. They found that the fish come together from deeper water in the evening, shoaling in a disordered way. A chain reaction triggers when the population density reaches a critical value, like an audience wave travelling around a sport stadium. A rapid transition then occurs, and the fish become highly polarised and synchronized in the manner of schooling fish. After the transition, the schools start migrating, extending up to 40 kilometres (25 mi) across the ocean, to shallow parts of the bank. There they spawn during the night. In the morning, the fish school back to deeper water again and then disband. Small groups of leaders were also discovered that significantly influenced much larger groups. Leadership and decision- making Fish schools are faced with decisions they must make if they are to remain together. For example, a decision might be which direction to swim when confronted by a predator, which areas to stop and forage, or when and where to migrate. Quorum sensing can function as a collective decision-making process in any decentralised system. A quorum response has been defined as \\"a steep increase in the probability of group members performing a given behaviour once a threshold minimum number of their group mates already performing that behaviour is exceeded\\". A recent investigation showed that small groups of fish used consensus decision-making when deciding which fish model to follow. The fish did this by a simple quorum rule such that individuals watched the decisions of others before making their own decisions. This technique generally resulted in the 'correct' decision but occasionally cascaded into the 'incorrect' decision. In addition, as the group size increased, the fish made more accurate decisions in following the more attractive fish model. Consensus decision-making, a form of collective intelligence, thus effectively uses information from multiple sources to generally reach the correct conclusion. Such behaviour has also been demonstrated in the shoaling behaviour of threespine sticklebacks. Other open questions of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals are responsible for the direction of shoal movement. In the case of migratory movement, most members of a shoal seem to know where they are going. Observations on the foraging behaviour of captive golden shiner (a kind of minnow) found they formed shoals which were led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available. If all golden shiners in a shoal have similar knowledge of food availability, there are a few individuals that still emerge as natural leaders (being at the front more often) and behavioural tests suggest they are naturally bolder. Smaller golden shiners appear more willing than larger ones to be near the front of the shoal, perhaps because they are hungrier. Observations on the common roach have shown that food-deprived individuals tend to be at the front of a shoal, where they obtain more food but where they may also be more vulnerable to ambush predators. Individuals that are wary of predation tend to seek more central positions within shoals. Shoal choice Fish, such as these sweepers, usually prefer to join larger schools which contain members of their own species matching their own size A swirl of different schools, each confined to its own species Experimental studies of shoal preference are relatively easy to perform. An aquarium containing a choosing fish is sandwiched between two aquaria containing different shoals, and the choosing fish is assumed to spend more time next to the shoal it prefers. Studies of this kind have identified several factors important for shoal preference. Fish generally prefer larger shoals. This makes sense, as larger shoal usually provide better protection against predators. Indeed, the preference for larger shoals seems stronger when predators are nearby, or in species that rely more on shoaling than body armour against predation. Larger shoals may also find food faster, though that food would have to be shared amongst more individuals. Competition may mean that hungry individuals might prefer smaller shoals or exhibit a lesser preference for very large shoals, as shown in sticklebacks. Fish prefer to shoal with their own species. Sometimes, several species may become mingled in one shoal, but when a predator is presented to such shoals, the fish reorganize themselves so that each individual ends up being closer to members of its own species. Fish tend to prefer shoals made up of individuals that match their own size. This makes sense as predators have an easier time catching individuals that stand out in a shoal. Some fish may even prefer shoals of another species if this means a better match in current body size. As for shoal size however, hunger can affect the preference for similarly- sized fish; large fish, for example, might prefer to associate with smaller ones because of the competitive advantage they will gain over these shoalmates. In golden shiner, large satiated fish prefer to associate with other large individuals, but hungry ones prefer smaller shoalmates. Fish prefer to shoal with individuals with which the choosing fish is already familiar. This has been demonstrated in guppies, threespine stickleback, banded killifish, the surfperch Embiotoca jacksoni, Mexican tetra, and various minnows. A study with the White Cloud Mountain minnow has also found that choosing fish prefer to shoal with individuals that have consumed the same diet as themselves. Sticklebacks and killifish have been shown to prefer shoals made up of healthy individuals over parasitized ones, on the basis of visual signs of parasitism and abnormal behaviour by the parasitized fish. Zebrafish prefer shoals that consist of well-fed (greater stomach width) fish over food-deprived ones. Threespine stickleback prefer to join a shoal made up of bold individuals rather than shy ones. Angelfish prefer shoals made up of subordinate rather than dominant individuals. European minnow can discriminate between shoals composed of good versus poor competitors, even in the absence of obvious cues such as differences in aggressiveness, size, or feeding rate; they prefer to associate with the poor competitors. All of this suggests a strategy to obtain food, as bolder individuals should be more likely to find food, while subordinates would offer less competition for the discovered food. Fish prefer to join shoals that are actively feeding. Golden shiner can also detect the anticipatory activity of shoals that expect to be fed soon, and preferentially join such shoals. Zebrafish also choose shoals that are more active. Commercial fishing The schooling behaviour of fish is exploited on an industrial scale by the commercial fishing industry. Huge purse seiner vessels use spotter planes to locate schooling fish, such as tuna, cod, mackerel and forage fish. They can capture huge schools by rapidly encircling them with purse seine nets with the help of fast auxiliary boats and sophisticated sonar, which can track the shape of the shoal. Further examples blacksmiths being cleaned by parasite eating fish Blacksmith fish live in loose shoals. They have a symbiotic relationship with the parasite eating senorita fish. When they encounter a shoal of senorita fish, they stop and form a tight ball and hang upside down (pictured), each fish waiting its turn to be cleaned. The senorita fish pick dead tissues and external parasites, like parasitic copecods and isocods, from the skin of other fishes. Some shoals engage in mobbing behaviour. For example, bluegills form large nesting colonies and sometimes attack snapping turtles. This may function to advertise their presence, drive the predator from the area, or aid in cultural transmission of predator recognition. Piranha have a reputation as fearless fish that hunt in ferocious packs. However, recent research, which \\"started off with the premise that they school as a means of cooperative hunting\\", discovered that they were in fact rather fearful fish, like other fish, which schooled for protection from their predators, such as cormorants, caimans and dolphins. Piranhas are \\"basically like regular fish with large teeth\\". Humboldt squid are large carnivorous marine invertebrates that move in schools of up to 1,200 individuals. They swim at speeds of up to 24 kilometres per hour () propelled by water ejected through a siphon and by two triangular fins. Their tentacles bear suckers lined with sharp teeth with which they grasp prey and drag it towards a large, sharp beak. During the day the Humboldt squid behave similar to mesopelagic fish, living at depths of . Electronic tagging has shown that they also undergo diel vertical migrations which bring them closer to the surface from dusk to dawn. They hunt near the surface at night, taking advantage of the dark to use their keen vision to feed on more plentiful prey. The squid feed primarily on small fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and copepod, and hunt for their prey in a cooperative fashion, the first observation of such behaviour in invertebrates. The Humboldt squid is also known to quickly devour larger prey when cooperatively hunting in groups. Humboldt squid are known for their speed in feasting on hooked fish, sharks, and squid, even from their own species and shoal, and have been known to attack fishermen and divers.

He was the winner of the 1912 Kentucky Derby,Churchill Downs Inc. an achievement he is best known for.  Background and Family  Worth was bred in Kentucky by R.H. McCarter Porter. He was sired by Knight of the Thistle, a stakes-winning stallion who was imported to the United States (New Jersey) in 1899. During his racing career, Knight of the Thistle won the inaugural 1843 Royal Hunt Cup, Great Jubilee Handicap, and Limekiln Stakes. Through his grandson King Plaudit (sired by Kentucky Derby winner Plaudit), Knight of the Thistle is an ancestor to American Quarter Horse Hall of Famer Maddon's Bright Eyes. Worth's dam, Miss Hanover (by Hanover), won her first start at Pimlico in 1899, defeating Pink Domino, the dam of Belmont Stakes winner and prominent sire Sweep and Curiosity, the dam of American Champion Juvenile Novelty. Miss Hanover was also the dam of 1916 Alabama Stakes winner Malachite and multiple stakes winner Hanovia. Worth's full sister, Fair Atlanta, is the dam of Dangerous, winner of the 1925 Travers Stakes and Belmont Stakes runner-up. Dangerous was trained by Carroll Shilling, the jockey that rode Worth in his Kentucky Derby. Fair Atlanta is also the dam of multiple stakes winners Bondage, Georgie, and Thessaly.  Racing career  Trained by Frank M. Taylor, Worth won the 1912 Bashford Manor Stakes and Raceland Stakes as a juvenile. Worth's biggest career win came in 1912 as a three-year-old when he took the 1912 Kentucky Derby. Ridden by jockey C. H. Shilling, the favored frontrunner Worth held off longshot Duval to win by a neck margin. His final time of 2:09.40 is among the slowest in the Derby's history.

He was appointed by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. Saxon left the Office of the Comptroller in January 1967. He subsequently practiced law in Washington and served as vice chairman of the board of the American Fletcher National Bank in Indianapolis.  Biography  James Joseph Saxon was born on April 13, 1914 in Toledo, Ohio. He received a law degree from Georgetown University in 1950. Saxon began his career as a securities statistician in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1937. He spent World War II as a roving problem solver for the Treasury Department, dealing with financial problems overseas. After World War II, Saxon served as a special assistant in the office of Treasury Secretary John Snyder. In 1952 he went to work for the Democratic National Committee. After the 1952 elections, Saxon became assistant general counsel of the American Bankers Association (ABA) in its Washington, D.C., office. Saxon left the ABA to work as an attorney for the First National Bank of Chicago. In 1961 President John F. Kennedy nominated James J. Saxon to be Comptroller of the Currency. Saxon's top priority was to expand the national banking industry and liberate national banks from regulation he deemed burdensome. Saxon permitted national banks to engage in businesses from which they had previously been barred, such as selling insurance and issuing credit cards. In his first years as Comptroller, Saxon changed the agency substantially by expanding its legal and economic staffs, undertaking a program to expand bank powers, and welcoming new banks and branches into the national banking system in contrast to the more restrictive practices of his immediate predecessors. Saxon created a system of regional comptrollers, each of whom exercised significant authority and autonomy. After resignation, he returned to the practice of law. He had a wide experience with legal and banking. James J. Saxon, had been at odds with the Federal Reserve Board for some time, encouraging broader investment and lending powers for banks that were not part of the Federal Reserve system. Saxon also had decided that non-Reserve banks could underwrite state and local general obligation bonds, again weakening the dominant Federal Reserve banks. When Comptroller James J. Saxon took office in November 1961, he found in existence methods of handling applications for new banks, branches, and mergers that had not been changed for decades. Almost every piece of paper pertaining to an application was considered secret, and virtually no public announcements of any kind emanated from the Office. In the preceding ninety-eight-year history of the Office, there had never been a public hearing or a written opinion published on an application. Anything that smacked of controversy was considered bad for the banking \\"image\\". \\"In fairness to all of Saxons distinguished predecessors in office\\", - it was at the time, that: \\"these methods are the traditionally accepted ones for a bank supervisory agency. They obviously could not have survived as long as they did without the approval of industry affected, of the courts, and of Congress.\\" Saxon defended his controversial record of chartering 369 new national banks during 1963 and 1964, insisting that such expansion was essential to keep up with the expanding economy and to generate competition among lenders. Like many bankers, he blamed bank takeovers by unsavory characters on a loophole in federal law (since closed) that left federal officials in the dark about changes in bank ownership. Mindful of congressional cries that gangsters may still be buying up banks to sanitize their hot money, Joseph W. Barr, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, announced that he set up a unit to help the Justice Department weed out criminals in banking.  Important cases  On July 31, 1964, defendant West Side National Bank filed an application for a charter as a national bank with Saxon, Comptroller of the Currency, pursuant to the statutes and regulations controlling such applications. See 12 U.S.C. 21 et seq. and 12 C.F.R. 4.1 et seq. Pursuant to these regulations, the Comptroller caused a field investigation to be made of the applicant and the surrounding circumstances. In accordance with the established practice, the agent- examiners of Saxon called upon the competitors of the applicant bank, informed them of West Side's application and ascertained their reaction to the application. = The issue = On August 21, 1964, the president of appellant Webster Groves Trust Company wrote the Comptroller, advising him of Webster Groves' opposition to the granting of the charter and requesting a formal hearing on the application. By letter of August 27, 1964, the Deputy Comptroller agreed to discuss the matter, and a meeting was arranged to take place in Washington, D.C. on October 6, 1964. At this conference, the representatives of Webster Groves and another objecting bank met with a Deputy Comptroller. On behalf of the objecting banks, Webster Groves filed a written protest to the granting of the charter and requested that they be furnished a copy of the application and that a formal hearing be held for the purpose of crossexamining the applicant and presenting evidence in opposition to the charter. The Deputy Comptroller indicated that the views of the objecting banks would be taken into consideration, but he did not accede to the request for a formal hearing. On December 12, 1964, the Comptroller approved the application for the establishment of the West Side National Bank, without holding any formal hearing. On January 27, 1965, Webster Groves and seven other banks brought this action against the Comptroller and the West Side National Bank, seeking to have the issuance of the charter declared unlawful, directing the Comptroller to cancel the charter and to conduct a formal hearing prior to the granting of another charter, and to enjoin West Side National Bank from establishing and operating its bank during the interim. Webster Groves Trust Company is the only one of the original eight plaintiffs that is appealing the District Court's judgment. = The verdict = The Comptroller is [also] asserting that a competitor has no standing to object to lawful competition. With this rule we find no fault, but the banks surely have the standing to object to illegal competition. Frost v. Corporation Commission of Oklahoma, 278 U.S. 515, 49 S.Ct. 235, 73 L.Ed. 483 (1929); National Bank of Detroit v. Wayne Oakland Bank, 252 F.2d 537 (6 Cir. 1958), cert. denied 358 U.S. 830, 79 S.Ct. 503. Therefore, when a competitor believes he is being subjected to illegal competition owing to impropriety by the Comptroller, the courts should be open to hear and decide the alleged wrong. The trial court was vested with jurisdiction over the subject matter of this litigation. The actions of the Comptroller under review, however, are perfectly consistent with his authorized statutory power, they did not violate any due process provisions of the Constitution and there is no indication that there has been any abuse of his discretionary authority. Consequently, for the reasons set forth herein and in the trial court's sound memorandum opinion, we believe the complaint of appellant was properly dismissed. Judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

The station, established in 1956, is currently owned by D&H; Broadcasting LLC. Programming KOWL broadcasts a news/talk radio format including local news, local talk, hourly updates from CBS News, and a number of nationally syndicated radio shows. Weekday syndicated programming includes talk shows hosted by Jim Bohannon, conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh, consumer advocate Clark Howard, former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, medical expert Dr. Dean Edell, and author Laura Ingraham, plus Coast To Coast AM with George Noory. Notable weekend programming includes a block of big band music and computer advice from The Kim Komando Show. HistoryThe beginning= This station signed on in November 1956, broadcasting with 250 watts of power on a frequency of 1490 kHz, and licensed to serve the community of Bijou, California. The new station was assigned the KOWL call sign by the Federal Communications Commission. KOWL owner Robert Burdette also served as the station's first general manager and program director. Although the station was licensed to serve Bijou, California, KOWL's later radio studios were located inside the Harrah's Stateline Club, a casino in Stateline, Nevada. The station's original transmitter, a Gates BC-250L \\"Hi-Watter\\" AM transmitter, and broadcast tower were installed roughly two miles south of the casino in South Lake Tahoe, California. The original Gates transmitter now resides at the Western Historic Radio Museum in Virginia City, Nevada. =New ownership= Barely 18 months after it launched, Burdette sold KOWL to Tahoe Broadcasters, Inc., in May 1958. Ed Frech took the reins as president with John J. Murphy as general manager. Just five years later, Tahoe Broadcasters, Inc., sold the station to a new company called KOWL, Inc., in a transaction that was consummated on June 1, 1963. The new owners applied for and, in late 1963, received a construction permit to upgrade their daytime signal to 1,000 watts while leaving the nighttime signal at 250 watts. In 1968, the station's application for a change in city of license was granted. This placed the city of license as the same community where the transmitter shack and broadcast tower had been located all along: South Lake Tahoe, California. KOWL broadcast a middle of the road music format through much of the 1970s with a number of hours taken each week for country & western. By 1978, the format was a blend of MOR and progressive country, thanks to the influence of the Bakersfield sound. In 1979, KOWL, Inc., sold the station to John and Kathleen Parker, Jeanette Merillat and Edward J. Pulaski who formed Pacific Communications, Inc. =The 1980s= In 1983, the station was sold to David Isenberg who formed Isenberg Media Corporation. In the following year, KOWL moved its offices and studios from Harrah's Tahoe to the Tahoe Keys Marina in South Lake Tahoe, California. In April 1989, Isenberg Media Corporation, through owner David H. Isenberg, reached an agreement to transfer the broadcast license for KOWL to Regency Communications Limited Partnership, of which Isenberg was a member. The shift was approved by the FCC on June 12, 1989. Regency also acquired competitor KRLT 93.9 FM, South Lake Tahoe. Isenberg left the partnership group entirely on September 10, 1990. =The 1990s= In February 1993, the members of the Regency Communications Limited Partnership applied to the FCC to transfer the KOWL broadcast license to Park Lane Regency Radio, Inc. The transfer was approved by the FCC on June 7, 1993. In August 1998, Park Lane Regency Radio, Inc., applied to shift control of KOWL to a new holding company called Regent Licensee of South Lake Tahoe, Inc. The transfer was approved by the FCC on August 13, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on February 10, 1999. Just a few months later, in July 1999, Regent Communications subsidiary Regent Licensee of South Lake Tahoe, Inc., reached an agreement to sell KOWL to Commonwealth License Subsidiary, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commonwealth Communications LLC (Dex Allen, principal). The deal, which also included FM sister station KRLT, was valued at a combined sale price of $1.25 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 27, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on November 5, 1999. =KOWL today= In October 2003, Commonwealth Communications, LLC, announced an agreement to sell the stations to Cherry Creek Radio (Joseph D. Schwartz, CEO) holding company CCR- Lake Tahoe IV, LLC, as part of a 24-station deal valued at a reported $41 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 19, 2003, and the transaction was consummated on February 3, 2004. At the time of the sale, the station aired a news/talk/sports radio format. KOWL and sister station KRLT were sold by Cherry Creek Radio to D&H; Broadcasting LLC effective June 30, 2015; the purchase price for the transaction was $650,000. It was announced on 11 August 2015, that KOWL was dropping Rush Limbaugh due to his show \\"repelling advertisers\\".

Numerous subfossils have been found, including complete skulls as well as vertebrae and osteoderms from such places as Ambolisatra and Antsirabe. The genus is thought to have become extinct relatively recently during the Holocene. It has even been suggested to have disappeared in the extinction event that wiped out much of the endemic megafauna such as the elephant bird following the arrival of humans to Madagascar around 2000 years ago. Its name comes from the Malagasy word for crocodile. Reconstruction of V. robustusIts size, stature, and presumed behavior is similar to the modern Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). Because V. robustus shared so many similarities with the Nile crocodile there must have been a great deal of interspecific competition for resources between the two crocodile genera if they were to have coexisted with one another. It has recently been proposed that the Nile crocodile only migrated to the island from mainland Africa after V. robustus had gone extinct in Madagascar. Description One unusual feature of V. robustus that distinguishes it from other crocodilians is the presence of prominent \\"horns\\" extending from the posterior portion of the skull. They are actually the posterolaterally extended corners of the squamosal bone. Other related crocodilians such as Aldabrachampsus also had similar bony projections, although in Aldabrachampsus these projections were more like crests than horns. Another diagnostic characteristic is the near- exclusion of the nasals from the external naris. It had a shorter and deeper snout than the extant Crocodylus niloticus, as well as relatively robust limbs. The osteoderms had tall keels and were dorsally symmetrical with curved lateral margins, running the entire length of the postcranial body. V. robustus has been estimated to have obtained lengths up to 5 m (16.4 ft) and a weight of 170 kg (375 lbs). These estimates suggest that V. robustus was the largest predator to have existed in Madagascar in recent times. Phylogenetics When V. robustus was first described in 1872, it was originally assigned to the genus Crocodylus.Grandidier, A. and Vaillant, L. (1872). Sur le crocodile fossile d'Amboulintsatre (Madagascar). Comptes Rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences Paris 75:150‚Äì151. However, it is now known to have had more in common with the extant Osteolaemus, or dwarf crocodile, than Crocodylus. Some features it shares with Osteolaemus include a depressed pterygoid surface that forms a choanal \\"neck\\" on the palate. Because it was not close enough to be placed in the same genus as the dwarf crocodile, it was assigned to the new genus in 2007. Before this reassignment, the species was considered by some to be synonymous with Crocodylus niloticus. However, this was most likely due to a misinterpretation of remains from the living C. niloticus with V. robustus and the poor description of the original material from which the species was described.Brochu, C. A. and Storrs, G. W. (1995). The giant dwarf crocodile: a reappraisal of ‚ÄòCrocodylus‚Äô robustus from the Quaternary of Madagascar.

The role of a chief investment officer within a corporate pension organization is similar, although the end-goal for the chief investment officer is often not profit, but matching the organization's pension assets with its pension liabilities. Chief investment officers at endowments and foundations also consider the liabilities of the organization, with an added focus on liquidity and alternative assets.

The most common model is to outsource all decision making including asset allocation, manager selection and monitoring. The OCIO reports back to the client but the burden is largely lifted from the client and placed on the new provider. Among OCIOs utilizing this approach, there is a \\"continuum of outsourcing approaches and providers: manager-of-manager programs; funds-of-funds; former CIOs offering a diversified model portfolio\\".Urie, Sandra. \\"CIO Outsourcing: Questions Investment Committees Need to Ask\\" Forbes, June 30, 2010.

In 1985, he established his own NASD-licensed (now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)-licensed) broker-dealer. By the year 2002, Marc J.

Career Lane undertook an eight-year research project to determine how investment choices can be utilized to communicate his clients' values, along with their money, to heirs. In 2003, Lane developed a new socially responsible investing approach, termed Advocacy Investing. In 2005, he published a book on the subject entitled Profitable Socially Responsible Investing? An Institutional Investor‚Äôs Guide. Lane‚Äôs investment strategy generated a result that beat the Russell 3000 benchmark by an annual return of 2.53% over the eight years ending December 31, 2003. Lane‚Äôs approach was discussed with both affirmative and skeptical views by the mainstream media. The Wall Street Journal commented that Lane‚Äôs theories added a new variation to the socially responsible theme. \\"Lane made the case that the way to do right by your conscience and your portfolio is to drop the typical SRI strategy of ‚Äònegative screening.‚Äô Instead, Lane‚Äôs way is to match the specific values of an investor with companies that have similar operational values. For example, a food bank with an endowment to invest would want to buy the stock of a company with a good human rights record, despite the fact that this company might also happen to produce beer.\\" Elizabeth Wine, reporter for On Wall Street magazine, noted that Advocacy Investing has become the new generation of socially responsible investing. She wrote, \\"Advocacy investing pushes the idea of sustainability, not just in the narrow environmental sense, but also in the sense of a company's long term potential to compete and succeed.\\" Stasia Swisler, President and CEO for the Giving Trust praised the approach by stating that \\"In the wake of ethics and governance scandals, this guide boldly takes socially responsible investing to a new level.\\" William Baue cautioned the readers to take his findings with the same grain of salt as he sprinkles on others‚Äô research as Lane excluded mutual funds outside the purview of his study in his book for practical reasons. Lane is the author of Advising Entrepreneurs: Dynamic Strategies for Financial Growth, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2001, along with a number of other titles published in the past 30 years. Lane's book on best corporate governance practices, Representing Corporate Officers and Directors, was first published in 1987. He revisited his treatise on corporate governance in 2005. The new, expanded edition, Representing Corporate Officers, Directors, Managers, and Trustees, was published in 2010.

It is located on the south side of High Street east of Green Street and south of the city's downtown. It is a 2-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its front facade is four bays wide, with a large chimney centered on one of the central bays, and the main entrance on the other. A lean-to section, probably added in the late 18th century, extends to the rear, giving the house a saltbox profile. A two-story, 19th-century ell is partially built over the lean-to and another, older addition. The interior includes exposed construction elements, revealing the different stages of construction. The exact sequence of construction of the building's elements was historically a subject of debate among Connecticut's leading architectural historians, including Norman Isham and J. Frederick Kelly. The oldest portion of the house is believed to date to c. 1700, and was built by Samuel Eells, a prominent local citizen. During the American Revolutionary War, it was owned by Stephen and Freelove (Baldwin) Stow. Stowe contracted to house and care for prisoners of war who had contracted smallpox; he eventually caught it and died of the disease.

This is contrary to the doctrine of entire sanctification that locates complete sanctification in a definite \\"second work\\" of grace which is a necessary prerequisite to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit.Synan, Vinson. The Holiness‚ÄìPentecostal Tradition: Charismatic Movements in the Twentieth Century. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1997. . Pages 149-150. The term finished work arises from the aphorism \\"It's a Finished Work at Calvary\\", referring to both salvation and sanctification. Though the term is used within Pentecostal Christianity, it is not exclusively a Pentecostal doctrine. The doctrine arose as one of the \\"new issues\\" in the early Pentecostal revivals in the United States. The dispute surrounding it was called the Finished Work Controversy which split the Pentecostal movement into Wesleyan and non-Wesleyan doctrinal orientations.  Controversy  Background = John Wesley advocated Christian perfection that held that while sanctification was indeed a definite work that was to follow conversion, it did not precipitate sinless perfection. Wesley drew on the idea of theosis to suggest that sanctification would cause a change in motivation that if nurtured would lead to a gradual perfecting of the believer. Thus while it was physically possible for a sanctified believer to sin, he or she would be empowered to choose to avoid sin.Three comparatively recent works which explain Wesley's theological positions are Randy Maddox's 1994 book Responsible Grace: John Wesley's Practical Theology, Kenneth J. Collins' 2007 book The Theology of John Wesley: Holy Love and the Shape of Grace, and Thomas Oden's 1994 book John Wesley's Scriptural Christianity: A Plain Exposition of His Teaching on Christian Doctrine. Wesley's teachings and Methodism gave birth to the holiness movement. Most holiness advocates taught that sanctification had both instantaneous and progressive dimensions.Blumhofer, Edith L. The Assemblies of God: A Chapter in the Story of American Pentecostalism. Volume 1. Springfield, Missouri: Gospel Publishing House, 1989. . Page 42-43. They taught the availability of entire sanctification, which was a post-conversion experience. In this \\"second definite work of grace\\", the inclination to sin was removed and replaced by perfect love.Blumhofer, Edith L. (1993). Restoring the Faith: The Assemblies of God, Pentecostalism, and American Culture. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. . Page 26. The state of entire sanctification allowed the believer to turn his or her attention outward toward the advancement of the gospel. In contrast, the state of partial sanctification was said to turn the believer's attention to the interior spiritual struggle for holiness which in turn limited his or her usefulness to the church and society. In time, significant Irvingite and Calvinist leaders became thoroughly embedded in the movement. These included Charles Finney, William Boardman and Dwight L. Moody. These Reformed evangelicals differed from their Wesleyan counterparts in that they rejected the holiness concept of a \\"second blessing\\" instead focusing on an \\"overcoming\\" life. In Britain, the holiness movement, centered around the Keswick Convention, developed into the higher life movement. This was most dramatically evinced in the formation of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In the United States, the holiness movement was somewhat less influenced by Baptist and Presbyterian soteriology. Methodism was far more influential. When Pentecostalism emerged as a distinct movement, it was through Wesleyan ministers such as Charles Parham and William J. Seymour. =Articulation and opposition= In 1910, William Howard Durham preached a sermon entitled \\"the Finished Work of Calvary\\" at a midwestern Pentecostal convention. His finished work teaching \\"sought to 'nullify' the understanding of sanctification as wholly realized in the believer by a crisis experience subsequent to and distinct from conversion\\". This teaching began the controversy that divided the Pentecostal movement into a three-stage and two- stage Pentecostalism. Three-stage Pentecostalism held the Wesleyan view that there are three distinct experiences of grace--conversion, sanctification, and baptism in the Holy Spirit. Two-stage Pentecostalism, which was the non- Wesleyan view held by Durham, held that sanctification was a lifelong process that began at conversion, thus this view only professed two stages--conversion and Spirit baptism. Durham wrote in his magazine, The Pentecostal Testimony: Converts began to share their beliefs in meetings and councils in the western United States where the Azusa Movement and its emphasis on sanctification as a definite experience was seen as orthodoxy, and any deviation was viewed with suspicion. This took the form of family members and friends who frequented various revival and camp meetings in the eastern US returning home to the Northwest and attempting to share their understanding of the new doctrine. The popularist version suggested that sanctification was not a requirement for Spirit baptism. This was viewed as a dangerous and fallacious polemic by the majority who assumed that anyone who had received the Pentecostal Blessing had in fact been sanctified and as an outright heresy by those who had slipped into the entire sanctification camp. In either case, proponents of the finished work were seen as contentious and were in many cases officially shunned to the point of dividing families. The dispute grew more heated in February 1911 when Durham went to Los Angeles where he was prohibited from preaching at the Upper Room and Azusa Street Missions. He was able to hold services at the Kohler Street Mission where he attracted 1000 people on Sundays and around 400 on weekdays.Clayton, 31-32 Durham died that same year, but the controversy surrounding finished work persisted. =Outcome= The effect of the controversy was that the young Pentecostal movement was split between Wesleyan-holiness and non-Wesleyan Reformed evangelicals. The finished work gained the greatest support from the independent and unorganized urban churches and missions. The Pentecostal denominations centered in the American South were the most resistant to the new doctrine. Today, these denominations (Church of God (Cleveland), Church of God in Christ, and Pentecostal Holiness Church) retain the second work understanding of sanctification.Synan, The Holiness‚ÄìPentecostal Tradition: Charismatic Movements in the Twentieth Century, 152. Despite the resistance of Wesleyan Pentecostals, however, finished work adherents were successful in persuading many Pentecostals of the validity of their view. As a result, most of the Pentecostal denominations founded after 1911 adhered to the finished work doctrine.Synan, The Holiness‚ÄìPentecostal Tradition: Charismatic Movements in the Twentieth Century, 151-152. This Reformed heritage can be seen in the Assemblies of God and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel.Clayton, 35 References Category:History of Christianity in the United Kingdom Category:Pentecostalism in the United States Category:Christian revivals Category:Evangelical theology Category:20th-century Protestantism Category:Finished Work Pentecostals ","title":"Finished Work"},{"id":"22783355","title":"Nelson Aerts"},{"id":"22783359","text":"T≈çdai-ji's latest \\"Daibutsuden\\" reconstructed in 1709 is a 9x7-bay kond≈ç (Japan's National Treasure) Main hall is the building within a Japanese Buddhist temple compound (garan) which enshrines the main object of veneration.K≈çjien Japanese dictionary Because the various denominations deliberately use different terms, this single English term translates several Japanese words, among them butsuden, butsu-d≈ç, kond≈ç, konpon-ch≈´d≈ç, and hond≈ç. Hond≈ç is its exact Japanese equivalent, while the others are more specialized words used by particular sects or for edifices having a particular structure. Kond≈ç (Asuka and Nara periods) The term started to be used during the Asuka and Nara periods. A kond≈ç is the centerpiece of an ancient Buddhist temple's garan in Japan. The origin of the name is uncertain, but it may derive from the perceived preciousness of its content, or from the fact that the interior was lined with gold. This is the name used by the oldest temples in the country.Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten A kond≈ç, for example H≈çry≈´-ji's is a true two-story building with a 3x2-bay central core (moya) surrounded by a 1-bay wide aisles (hisashi), making it 5x4 bays, surrounded by an external 1-bay wide mokoshi, for a total of 9x7 bays. The second story has the same dimensions as the temple's core at the first story, (3x2 bays), but has no mokoshi. Some temples, for example Asuka-dera or H≈çry≈´-ji, have more than one kond≈ç, but normally only one exists and is the first building to be built. Because of its limited size, worshipers were not allowed to enter the building and had to stand outside. The kond≈ç and a pagoda were usually surrounded by a corridor called kair≈ç. The use of kond≈ç declined after the 10th century, when it was replaced by a hond≈ç divided in and . The term remained in some use even up to the Edo period, but its frequency decreased drastically after the appearance of the term hon-d≈ç in the Heian period. Hond≈ç (Heian period) The term The term hond≈ç is translated as \\"main hall\\" in Japanese-English dictionaries. () enshrines the most important objects of veneration. The term is thought to have evolved during the 9th century to avoid the early term kond≈ç, at the time used by six Nara sects: the Nanto Rokush≈´. It became common after the introduction of the two Mikkyo sects (Tendai and Shingon) to Japan.JAANUS Various new types of temple buildings, including the hond≈ç, were built during the Heian period, in response to the requirements of new doctrines. Different buildings were called hond≈ç depending on the sect, for example: the kond≈ç (Shingon), the chud≈ç (Tendai), mieid≈ç (J≈çdo), the Amida-d≈ç (J≈çdo Shinsh≈´). A notable evolution of the hond≈ç during this period is the inclusion of a space for worshipers inside the hond≈ç itself, called gejin (see above). Other names such as are used as well, for example for the main hall at Mount Hiei's Enryaku-ji.The hall measures 11x6 bays, of which 11x4 are accessible by the public. The Tokugawa funeral temple of Kan'ei-ji, which had been built explicitly to imitate Enryaku-ji, also had one, though it has not survived.Watanabe (2005:30) Yama-dera in Yamagata is another example of a temple using this name. Butsuden (Kamakura period) This single-storied Zen butsuden at My≈çshin-ji seems to have two stories because of its mokoshi. The or is the main hall of Zen temples of schools such as the S≈çt≈ç and Rinzai. This architectonic style arrived together with Zen during the Kamakura period. There are following types of butsuden or butsu-d≈ç: * The simplest is a 3x3-bay square building. A bay is the space between two pillars, comparable to a Japanese ken (181 cm-197 cm). It has no mokoshi (an enclosure circling the core of the temple covered by a pent roof, usually one bay in width). * The second type is also 3x3-bay square, but has a 1-bay-wide mokoshi all around the core of the temple, making it look like a two-story, 5x5-bay building as in the case of the butsuden, visible in the photo on the right. * It is also known that during the 13th and 14th centuries, very large butsuden measuring 5x5 bays square having a mokoshi were built, but none survives. Large size 3x3-bay butsuden with a mokoshi however still exist, for example at My≈çshin-ji (see photo in the gallery below).

Laskar was born in Bihar, India. With the help of her family support, she finished her schooling and college, which wasn't much accessible to the women that time due to the cultural norms prevalent in India. It was during that time, when she discovered her talent for mathematics. She finished her Master's degree in Mathematics from B. R. Ambedkar Bihar University in the year 1955. Upon finishing college, Laskar, with strong encouragement from her elder brother, decided to come to the United States to pursue her Ph.D. in the year 1958. She worked for her Ph.D. degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under her advisor Henry Roy Brahana and received her degree in the year 1962. She is the first female Indian to receive a Ph.D. in Mathematics from UIUC. She returned to India after that and joined the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur as the first woman faculty at the institute. After three years, Laskar then moved back to the US at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and then finally joined Clemson University in the year 1968. Academic life Laskar took full advantage of the opportunities she had and set new standards for women in mathematics. She ranks among the top women in discrete mathematics in the number of articles published. According to MathSciNet, she has over 100 publications. Part of the reason for her success in this area is her collaboration network, which included Raj Chandra Bose and Paul Erd≈ës. She has extended her influence by supervising Ph.D. students. In 1986, Laskar and Steve Hedetniemi organized the Clemson University Discrete Math Miniconference, an event that has drawn an international audience each year since.

His work on the fluid dynamics of blood flow has had a major impact on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. More recently, Chien's research has focused on the mechanical forces, such as pressure and flow, that regulate the behaviors of the cells in blood vessels. Chien is currently President of the Biomedical Engineering Society and is one of only 11 scholars who are members of all three U.S. national institutes: the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine. Biography Chien was born in Beijing and grew up in Shanghai. Chien's family are descendants of the royal family of the King Qian Liu of the Kingdom of Wuyue. His grandfather Chien Hong-ye (Èå¢È¥ªÊ•≠) was a Chief Justice in the Supreme Court of the Republic of China (in Shanghai). His father Chien Shih-Liang, a chemist, was former President of Academia Sinica. His elder brother Robert Chien (Èå¢Á¥î) was former Minister of Finance of Taiwan, and former Secretary-general of Executive Yuan. His young brother Fredrick Chien is also an influential politician in Taiwan. Shu Chien married Dr. Kuang-Chung Hu Chien in 1957. From 1947 to 1948, Chien completed his medical preparatory study at Peking University Medical School. In 1949, Chien moved to Taiwan with his family. In 1953, Chien graduated from the National Taiwan University. Chien went to study in the United States in 1954 and obtained his PhD in 1957 from Columbia University. Chien also received M.D. from the National Taiwan University.Academia Sinica (Taiwan) Academician Profile: ÁîüÂëΩÁßëÂ≠∏ÁµÑ Èå¢ÁÖ¶ (The Division of Life Sciences ‚Äì Shu Chien)Lee Kuan Yew Distinguished Visitor Shu Chien (Nov 25, 2008, Singapore) From 1969 to 1988, Chien was a Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at the Columbia University. Chien was a Founding Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering in 1992. Chien is current President (since 1991) of the Whitaker Institute of Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Chien was the Chair of the Department of Bioengineering of UCSD from 1994 to 1999 and from 2002 to 2005. He is also the founding director of the Institute of Engineering in Medicine in July 2008. He was named as a recipient of the National Medal of Science by President Barack Obama on September 27, 2011 for \\"pioneering work in cardiovascular physiology and bioengineering\\". =1967 Science Papers= In 1967 Chien published three papers in Science that advanced the understanding of the physics behind the flow of red blood cells. Chien and his colleagues were able to explore the flow properties of red blood cells through various experiments involved with filtering red blood cells through plastic porous sieves. One key finding was that the flow of red blood cells does not follow Newtonian behavior and this characteristic is fundamental in aiding red blood cells to squeeze through capillaries. Chien and his colleagues further discovered the importance of the malleability of red blood cells to pass through tiny pores smaller than the cells' diameter. In other words, a healthy normal red blood cell is able to \\"squeeze\\" by deforming its shape and pass through small pores. In addition, this deformation helps lower the viscosity of blood and facilitate flow. Another important discovery that determines the viscosity of blood is the ability of red blood cells to aggregate to form rouleaux (like stacks of coins) due to their disc like shape. Chien and his colleagues discovered that this was a crucial factor in modulating viscosity and regulating blood flow and elucidated the mechanical, electrical and biochemical basis of this process. These discoveries show that the shape of red blood cells is not accidental, but rather a highly \\"engineered design\\" meant for efficient transportation. =Recent research= Chien has investigated the mechanisms by which mechanical forces such as pressure and flow regulate the behaviors of the cells in blood vessels, including the endothelial cells lining the vessel lumen and the smooth muscle cells in the vessel interior and their interactions. His work has led to the understanding how forces with a clear direction (as seen in the straight parts of the vascular tree) can protect the vessels from atherosclerosis and how forces without a clear direction (as seen in the branch points) make the vessels vulnerable to atherosclerosis. More recently, he has developed novel approaches to assess the optimum microenvironment for the growth and differentiation of stem cells. =Academic career= * Current, President of the Biomedical Engineering Society * 2008‚Äì2009, President of the Internal Society of Biorheology * 2006‚Äì2008, President-Elect of the BMES Publications Board of Directors * 2001‚Äì2002, President of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) * 1992‚Äì1993, President of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology * 1990‚Äì1991, President of the American Physiological Society (APS).

The particle used varies depending on the country, language and period of time. However, in some languages the nobiliary particle is the same as a regular prepositional particle that was used in the creation of many surnames. In some countries, it became customary to distinguish the nobiliary particle from the regular one by a different spelling, although in other countries these conventions did not arise, occasionally resulting in ambiguity. The nobiliary particle can often be omitted in everyday speech or certain contexts.  Denmark and Norway  G√∏rvel Fadersdotter of Giske (1517‚Äì1605). In the painting: 'Fru G√∏rvel Fadersdatter til Giedske' In Denmark and Norway, there is a distinction between (1) nobiliary particles in family names and (2) prepositions denoting an individual person's place of residence. Nobiliary particles like af, von, and de (English: of) are integrated parts of family names. The use of particles was not a particular privilege for the nobility. On the other hand, particles were almost exclusively used by and associated with them. Especially in the late 17th and 18th centuries, a person would often receive a particle along with his or her old or new family name when ennobled. Examples are families like de Gyldenpalm (lit. 'of Goldenpalm') and von Munthe af Morgenstierne (lit. 'of Munthe of Morningstar'). Otherwise, particles would arrive together with immigrants. Examples are families like von Ahnen. Prominent non-noble families having used particles are von Cappelen, von der Lippe, and de Cr√©qui dit la Roche. The preposition til (English: to, but translates as of; comparable with German zu) is placed behind a person's full name in order to denote his or her place of residence, for example Sigurd Jonsson til Sudreim. France In France (and England, largely as a result of the Norman Conquest) the particle de precedes a nom de terre ('name of land') in many families of the French nobility (for example, Maximilien de B√©thune). A few do not have this particle (for example, Pierre S√©guier, Lord Chancellor of France). The particle can also be du ('of the' in the masculine form), d' (employed, in accordance with the rules of orthography, when the nom de terre begins with a vowel; for example, Ferdinand d'Orl√©ans), or des ('of the' in the plural). In French, de indicates a link between the land and a person‚Äîeither landlord or peasant. Never in French history was this particle proof of nobility. The nobleman was always designated an escuyer (dapifer in Latin, for 'squire') or, better, a chevalier (miles in Latin, for 'knight'). Only knights could be designated by the spoken style monseigneur or messire (dominus in Latin, for 'sir'), as, for example, \\"monseigneur Bertrand du Guesclin, chevalier\\" (in English form, 'Sir Bertrand du Guesclin, knight'). So, in fact and by convention, surnames with the non-noble use of the particle de are spelled as a single word (e.g., \\"Pierre Dupont\\"), though many such conserved the de as a separate word. From the sixteenth century, surnames among the French nobility have often been composed of a combination of patronymic names, titles, or noms de terres ('names of lands' or estates) joined by the preposition de, as in \\"Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord\\". The use of this particle began to be an essential appearance of nobility. But, after the end of the Kingdom of France, the use of de has not invariably evidenced nobility, as shown in Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing's grandfather's change of name in the early-twentieth century.Despite the addition of \\"d'Estaing\\" to the family name by his grandfather, Giscard d'Estaing is not descended from the extinct noble family of the Comtes d'Estaing. Giscard d'Estaing's grandfather adopted the \\"D'Estaing\\" name in 1922 because it had become extinct in his family (the grandfather was descended from another branch of the count's family through one of his great-great-grandmother ‚Äì Lucie-Madeleine d'Estaing, dame de R√©quistat ‚Äì with two breaks in the male line): the lady R√©quistat was the last to carry that surname in the grandfather's branch of the family, and so he successfully petitioned the government for the right to add it to his family name. Even earlier in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries many middle-class families simply adopted the particle without being ennobled; Maximilien Robespierre's family, for example, used the particle for some generations. Germany and Austria In Germany and Austria, von (descending from) or zu (resident at), generally precedes the surname of a noble family (in, for example, the names of Alexander von Humboldt and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim). If it is justified, they can be used together (\\"von und zu\\"): the present ruler of Liechtenstein, for example, is Johannes Adam Ferdinand Alois Josef Maria Marko d'Aviano Pius von und zu Liechtenstein. In some cases - if even not very frequent, for instance as a distinction of more split-ups of family lines - these more common particles could even have been supplemented with auf (i.e., residing at yet another place different from the one zu refers to and meaning [up]on in English): Von A-dynasty/place, at B-town, auf C-ville/location/residence. As in France and Spain, not all noble families use a nobiliary particle. The names of the most ancient nobility, the Uradel, but also names of some old untitled nobility, often do not contain the particle von or zu, such as Grote, Knigge or Vincke.\\"Nichtadeliges ¬´von¬ª\\" (Non-noble \\"von\\"), adelsrecht.de, retrieved on 8 January 2013. Conversely, the prefix von occurs, in the names of 200 to 300 non-noble families,\\"Adelszeichen und Adel: Kennzeichnet das 'von' in jedem Fall eine Adelsfamilie?\\" (Nobiliary particle and nobility: Does the \\"von\\" indicate a noble family in every case?), Institut Deutsche Adelsforschung (Institute of German nobility research), retrieved on 8 January 2013. much like van in the Netherlands. Especially in northwestern Germany (Bremen, Hamburg, Holstein, Lower Saxony, Schleswig, Westphalia) and in German-speaking Switzerland, von is a frequent element in non-noble surnames. In Austria and Bavaria, non-noble surnames containing von were widely altered by compounding it to the main surname element in the 19th century, such as von Werden ‚Üí Vonwerden. Hungary Although Hungary was part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Hungarian nobility used a different particle, de, which had no meaning in Hungarian and was apparently borrowed from French and/or Latin. Portugal In Portugal there are not, and never were, any special naming conventions to show nobility. Personal titles like Dom (and its female variant Dona) may be used by the clergy, for instance, before their Christian name, not implying nobility, except if one previously knows the name as belonging to a commoner. Furthermore, Portuguese nobility is traditionally recognised just to people being born to four noble quarters: both grandfathers and both grandmothers must have been noble for their grandson or granddaughter to be considered a noble at birth, independently of any noble name, with or without particle. Portuguese surnames do not indicate nobility, as usually the same surnames exist in noble and non-noble families. The restriction to nobility and the clergy of bearing arms at the beginning of the 16th century, when king Manuel I extinguished the previous bourgeoisie armorial, usually shows someone to be noble if he or she bears personal or family arms. But nobility in Portugal was never restricted to the bearers of arms, and many Portuguese nobles did not or do not have arms at all. The preposition de, and its different orthographic forms (do, dos, da and das), like in France, do not indicate nobility in the bearer. Portuguese modern law recognises to any citizen the right not to sign those particles, even if they are present in their identification documents, and the opposite right is legally allowed to those Portuguese citizens who, not having in their documentation any such prepositions, are able to sign it if they wish. In fact, articles and prepositions are considered in Portuguese nomenclature just as an embellishment to any name. Good taste made usually Portuguese nobility reduce prepositions linking their many surnames, signing just one at the beginning of the name, and then the last surname being preceded by e (and), not to repeat the preposition. For instance, the name Jo√£o Duarte da Silva dos Santos da Costa de Sousa may also legally be signed Jo√£o Duarte Silva Santos Costa Sousa. Tradition and good taste should make him sign just Jo√£o Duarte da Silva Santos Costa e Sousa. The last \\"and\\" (e) substitutes all previous surnames' prepositions except the first one, and cannot ever be used without a previous preposition to justify it. An exception to this rule is only shown with duplicate surnames linked by and (e), for instance when the maternal surnames come before the paternal ones: Diogo Afonso da Concei√ß√£o e Silva (name and mother's duplicate surname)Tavares da Costa (paternal duplicate surname). From the 19th century on, it became customary for Portuguese titled nobility to socially indicate their title as a subsidiary surname: for instance, Diana √Ålvares Pereira de Melo, 11th Duchess of Cadaval who goes by Diana de Cadaval after her title. This social rule does not apply to members of the Portuguese royal house. Spain In Spain, the nobiliary particle de is also used in two different styles. The first is a \\"patronymic-de-toponymic\\" formula, as used by, among others, the fifteenth-century general Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, the fourteenth-century chronicler and poet Pero L√≥pez de Ayala, the European discoverer of the eastern Pacific, Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa, and many other conquistadors. The second style is use of the particle de before the entire surname. This style resembles but is more ambiguous than the French one, since there is no convention for a different spelling when the de is simply a prepositional particle in non-noble toponymic names such as De la R√∫a (literally, \\"of the street\\") or De la Torre (\\"of the tower\\"). Examples of nobility particle de without patronymic include the sixteenth-century first Marquis of Santa Cruz, √Ålvaro de Baz√°n, the conquistador Hernando de Soto, a common tradition in Spanish culture. Unlike French, Spanish lacks elision, and so no contraction is used when the surname starts with a vowel (though exceptionally we find Pedro Arias D√°vila), but contraction is used when the surname includes the article \\"el\\" as in Baltasar del Alc√°zar. A Spanish law on names, from 1958 and still in force, does not allow a person to add a de to their surname if it does not already have it. The law does allow for one exception. A de may be added in front of a surname that could be otherwise misunderstood as a forename.Article 195, Reglamento del Registro Civil: \\"On petition of the interested party, before the person in charge of the registry, the particle de shall be placed before the paternal surname that is usually a first name or begins with one\\" (for example, a birth may be registered for a \\"Pedro de Miguel Jim√©nez\\", to avoid having \\"Miguel\\" taken for a middle name). Article 206 does allow persons to remove de and an article from their surname, should they so desire. Conclusive proof of the nobility of a surname can be determined by establishing whether that surname is associated with a blazon, since for centuries coats of arms have been borne legally only by persons of noble condition.Castilian sovereigns restricted arms to members of the nobility by virtue of Law 64 of the 1583 Cortes de Tudela and Law 13 of the 1642 Cortes. This can be checked online at the website of the Real Chancilleria de Valladolid, which historically has handled cases involving hidalgu√≠a (nobility). Surnames composed of two names linked by a hyphen (\\"-\\"), implying that equal importance is given to both families, do not indicate nobility. For example, the hyphenated surname Su√°rez-Llanos does not indicate nobility. Switzerland In Switzerland, de or von precedes a noble name, depending on the canton of origin. United KingdomEngland and Wales= In the Middle Ages, the words de, borrowed from Latin and French, and the English of, were often used in names in England and Wales, as in \\"Simon de Montfort\\" and \\"Richard of Shrewsbury\\". However, the usage of \\"de\\" is often misunderstood, as in most cases it was used only in documents written in Latin or French. At the time, in translating into English, \\"de\\" was sometimes converted into \\"of\\" and sometimes omitted; only rarely was it used in the English form of a name. It is also significant that both \\"de\\" and \\"of\\" were used simply to show geographical origin in the names of people of all classes, so that in England and Wales neither word should be looked on as in themselves nobiliary. Despite the lack of official significance of the words \\"de\\" or \\"of\\" in names, there was sometimes a perception that they connoted nobility. For example, on 8 October 1841, a month after Thomas Trafford was created the 1st Baronet de Trafford, Queen Victoria issued a royal licence to \\"Sir Thomas Joseph Trafford ... that he may henceforth resume the ancient patronymic of his family, by assuming and using the surname of De Trafford, instead of that of 'Trafford' and that such surname may be henceforth taken and used by his issue.\\" The anglicisation to Trafford had probably occurred in the 15th century, when the Norman article \\"de\\", signifying that a family originated from a particular place, was generally dropped in England. The resumption of such older versions of family names was a Romantic trend in 19th-century England, encouraged by a mistaken belief that the article \\"de\\" indicated nobility. As in Spain, English and Welsh surnames composed of two names linked by a hyphen (\\"-\\") do not necessarily indicate nobility, e.g. Rees-Jones and not all double barrelled names require a hyphen, e.g. Henry Beech Mole. However, historically in the United Kingdom a multi-barrelled name was indicative of good pedigree and social standing, such that there was and remains a link between hypenated names and nobility and gentry. The reason for this was to preserve the names of aristocratic families which had died out in the mainline. When was to occur it was generally possible for the last male member of the his family to convey his \\"name and arms\\" (coat of arms) with the rest of his estate via his will, usually to a male descendant of one of his female relatives, who would then apply for a royal licence to take the name. Royal licences could similarly be obtained where the applicant's mother was a heraldic heiress, although this was less common. For instance, Sir Winston Spencer-Churchill's surname evidences his descendancy from both the aristocratic Spencer family, amongst whom the Earls Spencer are prominent, and the illustrious background of the Churchills, who hark back to their founder- hero, the prominent military leader John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and whose descendant's had died out in the male line (typically the male line descent would be placed last thus it would have been 'Churchill-Spencer' had not the royal licence specified that it would be 'Spencer-Churchill'). Some of the grandest members of the British aristocracy have triple-barrelled names, for instance the Vane-Tempest-Stewart family, who hold the marquessate of Londonderry; for a while, the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos bore five surnames: Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville. However in contemporary Britain this correlation has weakened, as more middle and lower class families have started hyphenating their names on marriage, and/or passing it to their issue, with 11% of newlyweds in the 18-34 demographic hyphenating their surnames as of 2017. In modern times, a nobiliary particle (as the term is widely understood on the Continent) is rarely used. More usual is the territorial designation, which in practice is almost identical. =Scotland= In Scotland, there is strictly no nobiliary particle, but the use of the word of as a territorial designation has a long history. In this usage, \\"of\\" and a place name follow on from a family surname, as in the name \\"Aeneas MacDonell of Glengarry\\". If the place name is identical to the surname, it is sometimes rendered as \\"that Ilk\\", e.g. \\"Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk\\". Recognition of a territorial designation is granted in Scotland by the Lord Lyon to Scottish armigers (those entitled to bear a coat of arms) who own or were born in or are associated with named land, generally in a rural area not forming part of a town. The Lord Lyon advises that for a territorial designation to be recognised there must be \\"ownership of a substantial area of land to which a well-attested name attaches, that is to say, ownership of an 'estate', or farm or, at the very least, a house with policies extending to five acres or thereby\\". The territorial designation in this case is considered to be an indivisible part of the name, not in itself necessarily indicating historical feudal nobility, but recognition in a territorial designation is usually accorded alongside the grant or matriculation of a Scottish coat of arms, which effectively confers or recognises minor nobility status, even if not ancient. Despite this, the right to bear a territorial designation can also exist for landowners who are not armigerous, however this right is not made good until receiving official recognition; Learney comments: \\"mere assumption is not sufficient to warrant these territorial and chiefly names\\". A person bearing a Scottish territorial designation is either a Feudal Baron, Chief or Chieftain or a Laird, the latter denoting \\"landowner\\", or is a descendant of one of the same. The Lord Lyon is the ultimate arbiter as to determining entitlement to a territorial designation, and his right of discretion in recognising these, and their status as a name, dignity or title, have been confirmed in the Scottish courts. In speech or correspondence, a Laird is correctly addressed by the name of his estate (particularly in lowland Scotland) or his surname with designation, e.g. William Maitland of Lethington would be addressed as \\"Lethington\\" or \\"Maitland of Lethington\\". Other countries Although many languages have nobiliary particles, their use may sometimes be misleading, as it often does not give any evidence of nobility. Some examples are: * Latin America: # Brazil continued to recognize the distinction of its nobility longer than its republican neighbors, since it remained a monarchy until 1889, but it has also been a republic ever since. Nobility in Brazil was based on that of Portugal, with the only distinction that in the Brazilian Empire titles and simple nobility were conferred only on a personal basis, and could not be inherited, unlike Portugal. In fact, unlike colonial nobility, Brazilian Empire nobility was awarded as a private and personal decoration for one lifespan, though in very rare cases, some Brazilian titles were again conferred to one or two more generations. Brazilian imperial nobility did not enjoy any financial or land privileges. With the exception of the imperial family, a difference between a person with a Brazilian nobiliarchic title or descendant of someone who was a Brazilian noble from another who was not a noble and not descended from a Brazilian noble, was only the status and distinction of nobility. # Spanish-speaking countries other than Spain use the particle de without legally meaning nobility. With only a few short-lived exceptions, all Spanish American countries adopted a republican form of government and abolished noble distinctions (but see the article on the Mexican nobility). Laws on names vary in Latin America but occasionally people are able to fashion new surnames that may sound noble: an example is Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar, whose father, Ricardo P√©rez de Cu√©llar, decided to permanently combine his last names as a more distinguishable paternal last name for his offspring. *Arabic-speaking countries : The definitive article \\"Al\\" or \\"El\\" (in Lebanon and Palestine) meaning \\"The\\" is added before the surname to add noblesse. For example, Suleiman Ahmad could become Suleiman Al-Ahmad. Nobility in the Middle East varies as diversely as the cultures in the Arab world. Some examples: Maronitic nobility had been granted by the Church (El Azzi, El Khazen, et alia), versus Islamic nobility such as the Hashemite dynasty which based their status on descent from the Prophet Mohammed. Other noble families married into the European aristocracy, such as the House of Sursock. Many names bearing the particle \\"El/Al\\", however, are pertinent to their place of origin (El Tabarji: meaning \\"The person from Tabarja). * Italy: The nobiliary particles (or predicati) de or di are used after the surname or the name of the title. Di is sometimes contracted when the surname begins with a vowel, in accordance with Italian orthography. An example of nobility is the name of the noted writer Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, where Tomasi is the surname and Lampedusa was the family's feudal property. An ordinary use is found in the name of the American actor Leonardo DiCaprio, of Italian descent (his surname is spelled as a single word, in accordance with standard English practice). However, the surnames of certain Italian noble families are by their nature toponymic, reflecting the names of medieval feudal properties, e.g. di Savoia, d'Aquino. Further, the use of the particle \\"de\\" or de‚Äô is often an abbreviation for \\"dei,\\" suggesting the family is of a noble family. For instance, Lorenzo de‚Äô Medici means Lorenzo of the Medici [family]. The use of the particle \\"de\\" might also suggest that the family descends from a Norman nobility, which continues to employ the Latin usage. Nevertheless, the ordinary use of the prepositions \\"Di\\" (of) or \\"Da\\" (from), also in conjunction with articles (Del, Della, Dei, Dal, Dalla, Dai, etc. ) can easily be part of the actual name and does not indicate nobility ex se. * Netherlands: The particle van is not an indicator of nobility (it is called a tussenvoegsel): the percentage of van- preceded surnames that are noble is not significantly higher than that of any other surname; they are evenly spread over the social strata. However, the particles tot and thoe, historically meaning \\"at\\" and related to German zu, are a strong indicator of nobility if combined with van in a surname, such as van Voorst tot Voorst (the prepositions tot and thoe were once used to denote the place of residence of a lord, whereas van referred to the domain whence he derived his title). Note that many noble families in the Netherlands have non- noble branches that are closely related and share the same surname. Double surnames are, therefore, a weak but significant indicator of nobility; many patrician and other families have double names as well. * Somalia: The nobiliary particle is Aw meaning \\"honorable\\", \\"venerable\\", or simply \\"Sir\\". Reserved for learned Islamic clerics, and used throughout the Somali territories. During his research in the ancient town of Amud, the historian G.W.B. Huntingford noticed that whenever an old site had the prefix Aw in its name (such as the current Regional Governor of Gedo Aw libaax), it denoted the final resting place of a local Saint.. * Belgium: The Flemish words de, der, and van may be nobiliary particles, but as in the Netherlands they are more often not of nobiliary origin so are not in themselves evidence of nobility. About the French word de, see France. * Sweden: Some noble families use 'af' as a nobiliary particle. This is the pre-1906 spelling of the modern Swedish 'av' (\\"of\\"), and corresponds to the German von. However, von has also been used in some noble families, some of German and some of Swedish origin. Thus Carl Linnaeus, upon his ennoblement, took the name Carl von Linn√©. The particles af and von do not have to be used with a toponym; they can simply be attached to the pre-noble surname. The word de has also been used in some families descended from 17th century immigrants of craftsmen and others from Wallonia in present-day Belgium. A well-known example is the De Geer family; other examples include Du Rietz and De Besche. *Finland: the old Swedish form 'af' and the German 'von', denoting descent or location, are used in some noble families. * Thailand: The Thai word na (of Pali origin) may be granted by a Thai monarch to form a Thai family name signifying 'of' a former kingdom or tributary state of Siam. Example: Na Ayudhya, putative royal lineage in the Ayutthaya Kingdom that may be granted after marriage into the royal Chakri Dynasty. The honorific particles Sri (RTGS: Si) and Phra (‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞) are also used in various names of Thai nobility (e.g., Somdet Chao Phraya Sri Suriwongse, RTGS: Si Suriwong). Phra, which is rooted in the Sanskrit vara (in Pali: bara) means 'holy' or 'excellent' and is also used as a formal address (Preah) in the royal names of several Cambodian rulers (Preah Norodom Sihanouk and his son Preah Norodom Sihamoni). The particle Sri which derives from the old Indo- Aryan Sanskrit word Shri that was used in Vedic scriptures to address gods, goddesses (e.g., Sri Lakshmi) and kings (rajahs), is also used in other countries of Southeast Asia with respective vowel shifts. Variations of it, for example, are found in the federal constitutional monarchy of Malaysia (granted title datuk seri as in: Dato Seri Najib Razak), in the Republic of Indonesia (Batak and Indonesian national hero: King Sisingamangaraja XII; Javanese: Sri Mulyani Indrawati, former Finance Minister of Indonesia) and in Sri Lanka (country name itself and the last ruler of the Sinhalese Kingdom: Sri Vikrama Rajasinha).

A+D Museum 2018. 900 East 4th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90013  History  A+D Museum was founded by Stephen Kanner and Bernard Zimmerman in 2001. Kanner was inspired by a similar museum he had visited in Helsinki, Finland. The Museum first opened its doors in January 2001 in the Bradbury Building, located at 304 South Broadway (3rd Street and Broadway) in downtown Los Angeles; a space donated by Ira Yellin. When the Bradbury building was sold in 2003 the museum moved to a temporary location on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. In 2006 it found a home on Museum Row in the Miracle Mile district at 5900 Wilshire Boulevard; across the street from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In April 2010, the museum moved down the street to 6032 Wilshire Boulevard. Displaced by the extension of the Metro Purple Line, A+D Museum returned to downtown Los Angeles to a warehouse-turned-museum in the Arts District in the summer of 2015.  Mission  A+D Museum was created to celebrate and promote an awareness of architecture and design in everyday life through exhibits, educational programs, and public outreach to the design community as well as the public in the greater Los Angeles area.  Community  A+D Museum is an all-inclusive information and education center for design, including architecture, interior design, landscape design, fashion design, product design, graphic design, and film/theater design. It is the only museum in Los Angeles where continuous exhibits of architecture and design are on view. Through exhibits, symposia, multi-disciplinary projects, educational and community programming, A+D serves as a showcase for the work of important regional, national and international designers, providing a forum for contemporary issues in architecture, urbanism, and design that are helping to shape the city. A+D Museum is also home to the Stephen Kanner Education Center for Architecture and Design which partners with various organizations throughout Los Angeles to provide students with different opportunities for learning, growth and mentorship. This center serves as a venue for student work, special critiques, charrettes, lectures, movie screenings and ongoing education workshops, including A+D's ARkidECTURE + design program. Partnerships have included Heart of Los Angeles), St. Elmo's Village, the Craft Contemporary, Petersen Automotive Museum and Broodwork.  Background  A+D Museum is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization funded by public donations, government and private foundation grants and corporate sponsors. A+D is a member of the American Alliance of Museums, the International Confederation of Architectural Museums and is recognized by design industry associations such as the American Institute of Architects/LA, the Industrial Designers Society of America/LA and the American Architectural Foundation.  Notable exhibitions  Key exhibitions define the agenda of the museum and its contributions to the discourse of architecture. Some of the A+D notable exhibits include: * Never Built: Los Angeles (07.28.13 - 10.27.13). An illustration of many major architectural designs that were planned for the city but were ultimately never built. The exhibition, which included models, sketches, and renderings from a number of architects including Lloyd Wright, Frank Gehry, and Jean Nouvel, offered insight into what might have been and challenged Los Angeles' status as a city that promotes architectural innovation. * After the Flood: Building on Higher Ground (04.18.08 - 06.28.08) featuring an extended update of the exhibition from the US Pavilion at the 2006 Venice Biennale of Architecture curated by Christian Ditlev Bruun showcasing architectural responses to the August 2005 devastation in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. The update included a 2008 assessment of the rebuilding of New Orleans and the Pink Project by Brad Pitt and GRAFT for the Make It Right Foundation. On June 27, 2009 A+D hosted the US portion of the international symposia series Sustainable Dialogues bringing together architects, planners, and environmentalists from Asia, Latin America, and the United States. * 34 Los Angeles Architects (11.18.04 ‚Äì 02.22.05) illustrating the spirit and enterprise of 30 LA Architects and their impact on Los Angeles. * Public Works: Architectural Designs for the City of Los Angeles (07.15.04 ‚Äì 09.09.04).

Career Howard began his career in Hamilton, Ontario, mixing shows in local clubs, and touring across Canada with King Biscuit Boy. After a motorbike accident which left him unable to lift heavy equipment, he began working as an assistant at Grant Avenue Studios. In 1986, while working at Grant Avenue Studio, he met Daniel Lanois and began working on his solo album, Acadie. Lanois invited him to New Orleans to help set up a studio and begin work on The Neville Brothers album Yellow Moon, beginning a 23-year-long musical partnership. Howard worked on mixing, recording and engineering, as well as studio installations. They had studios in New Orleans, Kingsway, Emila Court on St Charles Ave, and a Victorian mansion at 1305 Soniat St, Mexico, and in San Francisco. In 1987, Howard recorded the Neville Brothers' Yellow Moon at Emila Court. In 1989, Bob Dylan's Oh Mercy was recorded on Soniat St. This is the house on Soniat St, New Orleans where Bob Dylan's Oh Mercy was recorded in April, 1989 by Mark Howard. Howard then recorded and mixed Daniel Lanois' debut solo album Acadie. In 1990, Howard recorded Chris Whitley's debut album, Living with the Law at Kingsway Studio and in 1991 recorded and mixed Lanois' second album For the Beauty of Wynona. In 1991, Mark began work on R.E.M.'s Automatic for the People. Whilst at Kingsway Howard worked on records for the Neville Brothers (Brother's Keeper), Peter Gabriel (Us), R.E.M. (Monster), Harold Budd (By the Dawn of the Early Light), and Iggy Pop (American Caesar). In 1993, Howard went solo as a producer, producing The Tragically Hip's Day for Night. He was nominated at the Canadian Juno awards for producer of the year. In 1994, Howard worked on post-production for Emmylou Harris's Wrecking Ball at the studio he shared with Lanois in San Francisco. Howard then opened a studio called the Teatro, in Oxnard, California, in an abandoned 1920s theatre. At this studio Howard and Lanois co-produced the soundtrack to the movie Slingblade, and Howard then produced Chris Whitley's Terra Incognita. In 1995, Howard co-produced with Ian Moore the latter's second studio album, Modernday Folklore. In 1996, Bob Dylan began work with Howard and Lanois on Time Out of Mind at the Teatro, and recorded at Miami's Criteria Studios for a month before returning to the Teatro to finish recording the album. The record went on to win three grammys, including Album of the Year. In Dylan's acceptance speech, he thanked Mark Howard, commenting that \\"we got a particular sound on this record which you don't get every day\\". The Teatro studio in Oxnard, California, an abandoned theatre that Howard turned into a recording studio. In 1997, Howard and Lanois recorded Willie Nelson's Teatro, named after the studio. In July 1998, Howard produced Marianne Faithfull's, Vagabond Ways. Faithfull was introduced to Howard by Bob Dylan, who said to her that \\"You know Marianne, people like us with funny voices, you have to be very careful who you let produce you.\\" U2 was the last band to record with Howard and Lanois at the Teatro, recording some of All That You Can't Leave Behind. After the Teatro Howard created his own studio at the Paramour Estate in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, which was originally owned by actor and director Antonio Mareno. At Paramour, Howard produced the Lucinda Williams album, World Without Tears, which was nominated for a Grammy award. Whilst at the Paramour Howard produced Vic Chesnutt Silver lake, a track with Eddie Vedder for soundtrack of the movie, I Am Sam, and the beginnings of Tom Waits Real Gone.

He was the third Bishop of Gaylord and held the title Bishop Emeritus in that diocese. Early life Patrick Cooney was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Michael and Elizabeth (n√©e Dowdall) Cooney. The oldest of four children, he has two sisters, Mary, now deceased, (a retired teacher of the Detroit Public School System) and Leontia (an Adrian Dominican nun), and one brother, Michael (a priest of the Archdiocese of Detroit). Cooney attended St. Edward Elementary School from 1940 to 1948, and Sacred Heart Seminary High School from 1948 to 1952. He then studied at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, from where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy in 1956. He then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University, earning a Bachelor's in Sacred Theology in 1958. Priesthood While in Rome, Cooney was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Martin J. O'Connor on December 20, 1959. He later obtained a Licentiate in Sacred Theology from the Gregorian in 1960. Upon his return to the United States, he served as an assistant pastor at St. Catherine Church in Detroit (1960‚Äì1962), assistant chancellor of the Archdiocese (1962‚Äì1969), and chaplain at Mercy College (1967‚Äì1972). From 1969 to 1983, Cooney was director of the Archdiocesan Department of Worship. He also pursued his graduate work at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, and there earned a Master of Arts degree in liturgical research in 1973. He was named, in addition to his role as Director of Worship, rector of the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament in 1977. Episcopal careerAuxiliary Bishop of Detroit= On December 3, 1982, Cooney was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit and Titular Bishop of Hodelm by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on January 27, 1983 from Archbishop Edmund Szoka, with Bishops Harold Perry, S.V.D., and Arthur Krawczak serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament. In addition to his duties as an auxiliary bishop, Cooney was the founding chairman of the Archdiocese's Church in the City Task Force from 1983 to 1990. He also served as liaison to the Catholic Chaplains of Region VI (Michigan and Ohio) from 1987 to 1991, and a member of Board of Directors for Notre Dame Liturgical Center (1987‚Äì1991) and for the Pontifical North American College (1988‚Äì1994). =Bishop of Gaylord= Cooney was later named the third Bishop of Gaylord on November 6, 1989. He succeeded Robert John Rose (who was appointed Bishop of Grand Rapids in January 1989), and was formally installed as Bishop on January 28, 1990.

In 2002, Cooney allowed Rev. Gerald Shirilla to serve as pastor of a church with a school, despite knowing that Shirilla had been removed from the Archdiocese of Detroit in 1993 following decades-long allegations of sexual abuse. After the Detroit Free Press reported on the situation in 2003, he said that Shirilla had made \\"some errors in judgment\\" but was \\"no threat to the well-being of our children,\\" only to suspend him two weeks later. On January 5, 2008, Cooney suffered a heart attack while preparing for an ordination ceremony. He then underwent quadruple bypass surgery at Munson Medical Center. Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cooney was a member of the Committee on Liturgy (1984‚Äì1996), Subcommittee of Bishops and Scholars (1988‚Äì1992), and National Advisory Council (1995‚Äì1998); and chairman of the Subcommittee on Use of Exclusive Language in Liturgy (1989‚Äì1991), Subcommittee on Book of Blessings (1989‚Äì1991), and Subcommittee on Cremation and Other Funeral Questions (1989‚Äì1993). He also co-chaired the Roman Catholic-Reformed Church Dialogue Committee from 1998 to 2001.

After much success riding in Puerto Rico, Eddie Belmonte came to the United States in the latter part of 1964 to compete at New York and area racetracks. He was the first Puerto Rican jockey to compete in the Kentucky Derby, riding Exhibitionist in the 1966 running of the American Classic. His crowning career achievement came as the jockey of Personality, winner of the 1970 Preakness Stakes and that year's Eclipse Award for American Horse of the Year.

On February 17, 1972, he rode five winners in a single day at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California.

It is part of the Gazetteer series of supplements for the Mystara campaign setting. Contents The book describes the land of Glantri, a country ruled by and for magicians. The book covers the history, geography, and economy of Glantri, with a special focus on the ruling families, their personalities, and intrigues. The Principalities of Glantri also describes Glantri City in detail, and includes many new spells. The book includes sections on living in the city and what it is like at night.Heard, Bruce. The Principalities of Glantri (TSR, 1987) The Gazetteer describes the nation's cultural and geographic background, adventures for Glantri, and its special features, including the fantasy city of Glantri City and variant magic systems. The nation's economy is explicitly developed in accordance with the dominion rules from the D&D; Companion Set, and the nation's armed forces are also described in War Machine terms (the D&D; Companion Set's mass-combat system). The origins, objectives, and main personalities of each aristocratic house and clan struggling for control of Glantri's Council of Princes are described, along with the number of votes it controls in the council. The book presents the city's assortment of guilds and brotherhoods, such as Beggar's Court, the Elven Liberation Front, the Free Fundamentalist Farmers, the Monster Handler's Syndicate, and the Thousand Fists of Khan, each with conflicting interests and political machinations. The Gazetteer offers an elaborate view of the magic- user's career, focusing on enrollment in the Glantrian School of Magic, which permits a magic-user character to learn new skills, like quick spell-casting and the ability to combine spells. The Gazetteer also provides player character (PC) spell-casting specialties: The Seven Secret Orders of the Great School of Magic are the Alchemists, Dracologists, Elementalists, Illusionists, Necromancers, Cryptomancers (runemasters), and Witches. Also provided are twenty suggested scenario ideas tied to distinctive features of the Glantrian campaign, including a four-page \\"graduation test\\"‚Äîa complete dungeon adventure designed to test magic-users hoping to graduate from the Great School of Magic. The 22\\" x 34\\" map is printed in color on both sides; one side is a political/terrain hex map of Glantri, with insets of two villages and an army camp, while the reverse is a map of Glantri City and its waterways. The map keys and building labels are not on the maps, so they can be shared with the players. Publication history GAZ3 The Principalities of Glantri was written by Bruce Heard, with a cover by Clyde Caldwell and interior illustrations by Stephen Fabian, and was published by TSR in 1987 as a ninety- six page booklet with a large color map and an outer folder. Karen Martin and Aaron Allston edited the book, and the graphic design and cartography was done by Dave Sutherland, Dennis Kauth, and Ron Kauth. Heard negotiated a freelance arrangement with TSR to write the Gazetteer, requesting to do a ninety-six page project because he felt that sixty-four pages would not be sufficient.Q&A; at BloSpot The Principalities of Glantri was the third in a series of Gazetteer books, each of which treats one nation or empire of the D&D; game's Known World; it was preceded by GAZ1 The Grand Duchy of Karameikos and GAZ2 The Emirates of Ylaruam. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed The Principalities of Glantri for Dragon magazine #129 (January 1988). Rolston called Glantri \\"Quite an unusual D&D; game setting\\", as it is a nation run by an aristocracy of magic-users, numbered among them disguised lycanthropes, vampires, necromancers, liches, and Immortals; and \\"a nation where religion is prohibited, and where being a cleric is a capital offense\\". Rolston commented that \\"Glantri City is the best-developed AD&D; or D&D; game city\\" he had seen, with the exception of Lankhmar as presented in TSR's Lankhmar: City of Adventure, noting that his favorite part is the similarity to Venice: \\"Glantri City has canals rather than streets, and travel is by bridge, gondola, or private boat\\". He also felt that the setting was visually \\"one of the nicest things from TSR in a long time\\", with its color map and the interior illustrations by Stephen Fabian, which Rolston called \\"strikingly ornamented and full of character\\". He concluded that \\"The Principalities of Glantri is well-written, nicely presented, and full of nifty and original suggestions for running a campaign in a land ruled by magic-users. There are plenty of ideas, tones, and themes to choose from, with a refreshingly flexible and spontaneous attitude toward introducing new rules and offbeat ideas.\\" Rolston felt that the source of its greatest strengths was the focus on magic-users, although he ceded that dungeon masters (DMs) may hesitate to run a campaign in a setting where clerics are illegal but can be played covertly. He also felt that most of the ideas, characters, and settings could be used for the AD&D; game, and that \\"no AD&D; game supplement offers such a rich development of the role of the magic-user\\".

In the 17th and 18th centuries, under the Restored L√™ dynasty, the Tr·ªãnh lords had Ta Vong Temple built on the islet. In the 18th century, under the Nguy·ªÖn lords the temple disappeared. In 1886, while Vietnam was occupied by the French, a musician who was secretly working for the French, received permission from the government to build a tower in the middle of Hoan Kiem Lake in honor of L√™ L·ª£i, one of the most famous figures of Vietnamese history and one of its greatest heroes. Legends surrounding his life involving the sword, Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n and Hoan Kiem turtle are associated with Hoan Kiem Lake and the island. The musician planned to secretly bury his father within the tower. Residents of the city discovered his plans and removed his father's body from the structure. The three-story tower was still completed and was originally named Ba Ba Kim Tower. The French erected a miniature Statue of Liberty on top of the tower. In 1945, after French control was overthrown, the Vietnamese government had the statue removed.

Life Born in New York City as James Vincent Savo on July 31, 1892, Savo began his career as a juggler in amateur contests and went on to the burlesque circuit and then Broadway. In 1938, he originated the role of \\"Dromio of Syracuse\\" in The Boys from Syracuse. Savo also starred in \\"Once In A Blue Moon,\\" (1935) written by Ben Hecht and Charles Macarthur. The film was not a success, costing Paramount pictures $350,000. In 1942 Isidore Herk and the Shubert brothers co-produced a Broadway show called Wine, Women and Song, starring Jimmy Savo and Margie Hart. The show was advertised as a combination of vaudeville, burlesque and Broadway revue, and ran for seven weeks. The revue included striptease, which shocked some of the audiences. Wine, Women and Song was closed by court order in December 1942. Savo was the author of two books: Little World, Hello! (1947) and I Bow to the Stones; Memories of a New York Childhood (1963).

The decomposition proceeds via a paramagnetic oxalate biradical intermediate. Recently it has been found that a high-energy intermediate in one of these reactions (between oxalyl chloride and hydrogen peroxide in ethyl acetate), which is presumed to be 1,2-dioxetanedione, can accumulate in solution at room temperature (up to a few micromoles at least), provided that the activating dye and all traces of metals and other reducing agents are removed from the system, and the reactions are carried out in an inert atmosphere.Luiz F.

Overview Initially known as Data Products, the company was founded by Erwin Tomash in 1962 in order to take controlling interest of Telex's Data Systems Division.f The division was behind on a contract to deliver disk files to General Electric. Dataproducts was able to complete the product and deliver to GE and later Ferranti, ICL and RCA. Sustained by the disk drive business and Informatics, Data Products began development of their first line printer. Introduced in 1963, the 3300 was a 300 line per minute drum printer that used a moving coil actuator for the print hammer. In 1966, core memory was added to the product line. With heightened sales and earnings, Data Products moved to a new site in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California in 1968. They started acquiring other businesses, including Staff Dynamics, a personnel agency and Uptime, a manufacturer of card readers. Graham Tyson replaced Tomash as CEO in 1971. The disk business was ailing in the face of increased competition and finally discontinued. Dataproducts switched from drum to band technology in the late 1970s and added dot matrix printers along with a series of thermal printers sourced from Olivetti. The telecommunications company Stelma was purchased and Data Card was formed to manufacture plastic card embossing equipment. Daisy wheel printers were added to the line with a purchase of the business from Plessey in 1978. A joint project with Exxon yielded a series of solid ink printers. Dataproducts used Toshiba engines for their first laser printers in 1989. Legal battles with Tektronix and Apple over the solid ink patents drained resources and ended with Apple discontinuing their product and Tektronix paying royalties. Jack C. Davis, 47, a former Harris Corporation senior vice president, replaced Graham Tyson as chairman and chief executive in May, 1986. By 1989, net income had dropped from a high of $27.7 million to $3.8 million, and Dataproducts fought off takeover attempts by a consortium. Dataproducts was purchased by Hitachi Koki Co. Ltd., a unit of Hitachi in 1990. Dataproducts later used Fuji Xerox engines for their Typhoon series of laser printers. The LZR1560/1580 was OEMed as the Apple LaserWriter Pro 810 in 1993. In 1998, the LZR 5200 continuous feed laser printer was announced. The Dataproducts brand name was used until it was formed into Hitachi Koki Imaging Systems in 1999. Clover Technologies Group, LLC (Clover) of Ottawa, Illinois, acquired the North American and European compatible printing supplies divisions of Ricoh Printing Systems America, Inc. (RPSA), manufacturer of Dataproducts and other compatible supplies brands, effective February 1, 2005, as announced by CEO Jim Schiefelbein and President Jim Cerkleski. Bill Barclay, former Executive Vice President of the RPSA supplies division, was named President of the new Dataproducts USA, LLC division of Clover. Financing for the acquisition was provided by Bank One. World headquarters of Clover Technologies Group is in Ottawa, Illinois, along with its manufacturing and distribution facilities. Dataproducts division, with its western U.S. distribution center, is located in Simi Valley, California with manufacturing in Mexicali, Mexico and in Porto, Portugal. The three plants provide over 200,000 square feet of combined manufacturing capacity of printer, fax and copier consumables. Informatics When Dataproducts was first formed, Informatics was created as a subsidiary that did contract software work and was headed by Walter F. Bauer. In 1964, Informatics acquired Advanced Information Systems from Hughes Dynamics. The AIS file management system led to MARK IV, a fourth-generation programming language that was the first software product to have cumulative sales of $10 million and later $100 million. DataProducts spun Informatics off as a public corporation in 1968. Beginning in 1983, Sterling Software made an unsolicited offer that became a takeover attempt and finally resulted in a merger in 1985.Walter F.

It can occur in various contexts. Chimeras are generally considered a contaminant, as a chimera can be interpreted as a novel sequence while it is in fact an artifact. However, the formation of artificial chimeras can also be a useful tool in the molecular biology. For example, in protein engineering, \\"chimeragenesis (forming chimeras between proteins that are encoded by homologous cDNAs)\\" p. 424 is one of the \\"two major techniques used to manipulate cDNA sequences\\".  Description  Transcript chimera = A chimera can occur as a single cDNA sequence originating from two transcripts. It is usually considered to be a contaminant in transcript and expressed sequence tag (which results in the moniker of EST chimera) databases. It is estimated that approximately 1% of all transcripts in the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Unigene database contain a \\"chimeric sequence\\". = PCR chimera = A chimera can also be an artifact of PCR amplification. It occurs when the extension of an amplicon is aborted, and the aborted product functions as a primer in the next PCR cycle. The aborted product anneals to the wrong template and continues to extend, thereby synthesizing a single sequence sourced from two different templates. PCR chimeras are an important issue to take into account during metabarcoding, where DNA sequences from environmental samples are used to determine biodiversity. A chimera is a novel sequence that will most probably not match to any known organism. Hence, it might be interpreted as a new species thereby inflating over diversity. = Chimeric read = A chimeric read is a digital DNA sequence (i.e. a string of letters in a file that can be read as a DNA sequence) that originates from an actual chimera (i.e. an physical DNA sequence in a sample) or produced due to misreading the sample. The latter is known to occur with sequencing of electrophoresis gels. Some methods have been devised to detect chimeras, like: * CHECK_CHIMERA of the Ribosomal Database Project * ChimeraSlayer in QIIME * uchime in usearch * removeBimeraDenovo() in dada2 * Bellerophon  Examples  * \\"The first mRNA transcript isolated for...\\" the human gene C2orf3 \\"...was part of an artificial chimera...\\" * CYP2C17 was thought to be a human gene, but \\"...is now considered an artefact based on a chimera of CYP2C18 and CYP2C19.\\" * Researchers have created receptor chimeras in their studies of Oncostatin M.

Johnston (born November 17, 1974) is an American educator and politician who served as the Colorado State Senator from the 33rd district from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was a candidate for Governor of Colorado in 2018, losing in the primary. Johnston was also a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2020, though he withdrew from the race in September 2019. Early life and education Born and raised in Vail, Colorado, Johnston is the son of former Vail Mayor Paul Johnston. After graduating from Vail Mountain School in 1993, he attended Yale University, earning his bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1997. During high school and college, he became involved in community service activities, including volunteering at a Denver homeless shelter and mentoring youth in a New Haven housing project. After graduating from college, Johnston taught at a rural high school in Greenville, Mississippi for two years as part of the Teach For America program. Based on this experience, he wrote the book In the Deep Heart's Core. After his program ended, he enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School of Education, earning a master's degree in education policy. While at Harvard, he worked with Al Gore's education advisor Jon Schnur. With Schnur and others, he helped to found New Leaders for New Schools, an organization dedicated to training and recruiting leaders for urban schools. Upon earning his master's degree, Johnston enrolled in Yale Law School, and became an education policy advisor to political candidates, including U.S. Senate candidate Tom Strickland in 2002.  Professional career  After returning to Colorado in 2003, he was hired as a principal by Joan Farley Academy, where he achieved an annual increase in the graduation rate. In 2004, he served as principal of the Marvin Foote Detention Center, which houses students in detention centers held in state custody, and organized the first high school graduation in the center's history. In 2005, Johnston taught education law at the University of Denver Law School and became the founding principal of Mapleton Expeditionary School of the Arts (MESA), a public school in Thornton, Colorado. As the school's principal, he helped to develop the school's curriculum and program as the school district shifted to developing smaller schools. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Johnston helped lead an education summit in New Orleans and worked with U.S. Congressman George Miller on legislation to recruit and retain teachers. He joined Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign as an informal advisor early in 2007; by May 2008, he was regarded as one of the campaign's key advisors on education issues. Obama delivered a major address on education from MESA in May 2008. The school's achievements were highlighted in an October 2008 campaign advertisement. Johnston has served on the boards of local and national education and service organizations, including the I Have A Dream Foundation, the Urban League, City Year, New Leaders, America Achieves, and America Succeeds. In 2010, he was featured in Forbes magazine's \\"7 Most Powerful Educators\\" and Time magazine's \\"40 Under 40\\".  Political career  Johnston in 2009. = Colorado Senate = In April 2009, Senate President Peter Groff announced his resignation, effective at the end of the 2009 legislative session, after accepting an appointment in the Obama administration's Department of Education. Johnston announced his candidacy for the seat in late April, facing former state representative Rosemary Marshall, Democratic National Committee member Anthony Graves and activist Renee Blanchard for the historically African-American legislative seat. The district spanned northeastern Denver, Colorado, and was roughly one-third white, one-third Latino, and one-third African- American.http://www.thedenverdailynews.com/article.php?aID=4208 He cited education as the central motivation for his run, including the failure of a bill during the 2008 session granting in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants. During his campaign for the legislative appointment, he met personally with almost all members of the vacancy committee. At the May 11 vacancy committee meeting, Johnston received 64 out of 126 votes on the first round of balloting to win the appointment. Johnston was sworn into office on May 29, 2009. He was later elected in 2010 to complete the rest of Groff's term and was then re-elected in 2012, each time winning more than 82% of the vote. Due to term limits, this would be his last term in the State Senate.  Tenure  In 2010, Johnston championed SB 10-191, legislation that modified teacher and principal accountability by measuring performance in part by student academic growth. The bill was signed into law by Governor Bill Ritter in May 2010. Johnston worked on passing the READ Act, which was signed into law in May 2012. The law provides districts resources to help K-3 students struggling to read by establishing a process for districts to identify K-3 students who read below grade level and work with their parents to provide extra reading support before students reach the fourth grade. The bill also created the Early Literacy Grant Program to provide funding to districts for literacy assessments, professional development, instructional support, and appropriate interventions, and would distribute approximately $16 million to districts for use in one of three literacy support programs: full day kindergarten, tutoring services, or summer school. Johnston was a co- sponsor of the ASSET bill, which allows students not legally entitled to be in the United States to pay in-state tuition at Colorado colleges and universities as long as they attend a Colorado high school for three years and graduate or earn a GED. Under previous law, students not legally entitled to be in the United States, who had graduated from Colorado high schools and had benefited from the state's investment in K-12 education were forced to pay out-of-state tuition. After languishing in the legislature for almost a decade, the bill passed and was signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper in April 2013. \\"We come here today to close a chapter in American history, and to open a new one,\\" Johnston remarked. \\"For me personally, there's no more significant bill that I've worked on that's going to make an actual impact on human beings.\\" =2018 gubernatorial election= Johnston ran for Governor of Colorado in 2018. He lost the Democratic primary election to U.S. Representative Jared Polis. After the primary, Johnston endorsed Polis as the Democratic nominee. Polis would go on to defeat Republican Walker Stapleton in the general election. =2020 U.S. Senate election= In January 2019, Johnston entered the race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Cory Gardner. Johnston withdrew from the race in September 2019. Personal life Johnston lives with his wife Courtney and their three children: Seamus, Emmet, and Ava. Courtney is a Denver District Attorney who prosecutes crimes against children.

Fernando VI, who approved the Great Roundup. The Great Gypsy Round-up (), also known as the general imprisonment of the gypsies (prisi√≥n general de gitanos), was a raid authorized and organized by the Spanish Monarchy that led to the arrest of all gypsies (Romani) in the region, and their imprisonment in labor camps. The raid was approved by the King Ferdinand VI of Spain, and organized by the Marquis of Ensenada, and set in motion simultaneously across Spain on July 30, 1749. Since a royal edict by Charles II in 1695, Spanish gypsies had been restricted to certain towns. An official edict in 1717 restricted them to only 75 towns and districts, so that they would not be concentrated in any one region.  Organization  The plans for the roundup were developed in secrecy. Among the first to draw up plans was the appointed Governor of the Council of Castile, Gaspar V√°zquez Tablada, Bishop of Oviedo. It was later also supported by the opinion of the Jesuit Father Francisco R√°vago, confessor to Ferdinand VI, whose reply about the morality of the roundup can be summarised in his commentary that: The plan entailed sending troops to the towns with gypsy settlements, each carrying sealed set of instructions, which were only to be revealed to the commanders on a date just prior to the roundup in August. The gypsy settlements were to be surrounded, and all able-bodied adult gypsy males were internally deported to forced labor in the Naval arsenals or to specified mines, prisons, or factories. The women and children were forced into clothing manufacture. Those too ill to travel would remain in military custody until well enough to travel, or until they reached a \\"Christian death\\". The operation was to be funded by confiscated goods and homes of the gypsies. The mechanics of the raid varied in efficiency from town to town. The roundup in Seville, where the city gates were closed by the encircling army to prevent the target's escape, created alarm in the general public, who was ignorant of the goals. Special proclamations were obtained to avoid the use of churches as an asylum. The definition of who exactly was a gypsy proved to be difficult in many cases and was prone to abuse. For example, Gypsies married to non-gypsies were often spared. Nomadic gypsies, already less frequent, proved difficult to the roundup. Ultimately, nearly 9-12 thousand gypsies were detained. The latter stages of transport and housing of the detainees proved less organized. Reversal As protests began to arise from different communities, the orders were repeatedly modified to permit the release of some gypsies, often creating confusion among the local military commanders. Gradually, further imprisonments became sporadic, and in 1763, those gypsies who still remained in forced labor were ordered to be released by the king, a process that took the better part of two years. Epilogue The Gran Redada can be viewed as one of the last attempts by the crown of Spain to purify the country of Spain by large-scale dislocation of a whole ethnic community, preceded by the Expulsion of the Jews in 1492 and the Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609.

Biography Some Rajputs fought for Sher Shah Suri (otherwise known as Sher Khan) against Humayun in the 16th century. Later, some of the community were awarded zamindaris by the Mughal emperor Jahangir, an example of which was the family settled in Azamgarh that took the title of Raja from around 1609. By the time of Aurangzeb's reign, the rajputs had gained enough strength to field armed contingents including artillery, horse cavalry and elephants and made incursions against the neighboring zamindars of Gorakhpur. One late 17th-century rajput chief from the Azamgarh area, named Bikramajit Singh, converted to Islam after Aurangzeb threatened that he would otherwise be executed. His sons and descendants went on to found communities, establish markets and construct improvements such as a canal connecting the Tons River with the Kol. In the case of one Rajput family, from Nagar, the decision by the British East India Company to dispossess them in favour of another landholder was the cause of them joining in the Indian rebellion of 1857. Prior to that rebellion, some communities, in common with other groups that once held high status and power, were practitioners of female infanticide. This was in part a result of British policies that led to declining socio-economic fortunes and thus a reduction in their ability to construct favourable marriage alliances. Today, some Rajputs, who also refer to themselves as Thakurs, are Muslim and others are Hindus. However, their social and religious customs blur the lines that might usually be expected to exist between different religious communities in India. Indeed, their common identity as Rajputs often over-rides their differences in religion and they can be found participating in each other's customs and rituals.

The term halothermal circulation refers to the part of the large-scale ocean circulation that is driven by global density gradients created by surface heat and evaporation. The adjective halothermal derives from halo- referring to salt content and -thermal referring to temperature, factors which together determine the density of sea water. Halothermal circulation is driven primarily by salinity changes and secondarily by temperature changes (as opposed to the thermohaline mode in modern oceans). The generation of high salinity surface waters at low latitudes, which were therefore of higher density and thus sank, is thought to have been the dominant ocean circulation driver during greenhouse climates such as the Cretaceous. Similar dynamics operate today in the Mediterranean. The formation of bottom waters by halothermal dynamics is considered to be one to two orders of magnitude weaker than in thermohaline systems.

Shiva is worshipped as Avinasiappar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Karunambigai. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple complex covers five acres and it houses two gateway towers known as gopurams, each facing the Avinasiappar and Karunambigai shrine. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Avinasiappar and his consort Karunambigai being the most prominent. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Brahmotsavam festival is celebrated during the day of the Magam (February - March) is the most prominent festival. The original complex is believed to have been built by Cholas, while the present masonry structure was built during the Nayak during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Sculpture representing the saving of boy by Siva Avinasi indicates the one that cannot be destroyed indicating Shiva's grace to his devotees. As per Hindu legend, two boys of eight years of age took a dip in a tank when a crocodile swallowed one of them. The mother of the boy pleaded Sundarar to rescue his child and said that she was planning to do Upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) to the child when this incident happened. Sundarar, who was on his way to Tiruvanchikulam heard the incident and sung praises of Shiva in the temple. The boy was miraculously rescued from the clutches of a crocodile and this event is commemorated during the Mudalai Vaai Pillai Utsavam on Panguni Uththiram. There is a shrine to Sundarar on the banks of the temple tank and the bottom of the flagpost carries the image of the legend. Since the boy came out of crocodile's mouth, the place is called Pukkoliyur. Brahma is said to have worshipped the Shiva here for hundred years. The elephant of Indiran, Iravadham is said to have worshipped at this temple for twelve years. Architecture This temple is situated 40 km from Coimbatore and about 14 km from Tirupur. The nearest railway station is at Tiruppur and the nearest airport is Coimbatore International Airport. The Shiva temple at Avinasi is spread over an area of . The main rajagopuram is on the east side with seven tiers and is over 100 ft tall. Inside there are two corridors. At the main entrance, the sculptures of Narthana Ganapathy can be found on both the sides. Once we enter, there is a mandapam and the sculptures of Veerabadhirar, Oorthava Thandavar, Kaali can be seen on the pillars of the mandapam. The main shrine is for Lord Shiva known as Avinasiappar and the Ambal his consort is known Karunambikai . Ambal's sanctum is to the right of Avinasiappar's sanctum, unlike that in most temples. The mandapam in front of Ambal's sanctum has interesting sculptural work.The pathways on the four sides of the sanctum sancotrum are decorated with the images of Nayanmars, Murugan Sannadhi in the northwest and Karaiakal Ammaiar Sannadhi on the northeast. The large Nandi here and the carved image of a scorpion in the Ambal sanctum are of significance here. Several other carvings here deserve attention. Avinashiappar temple is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. The Theertham here is a well, called as Kasi Gangai Theertham. The sthala Vrisham is Paatiri. There is a shrine for Kaalabhairavar and is being worshipped here with the offerings of Vadai Maalai. Religious importance It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams - Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Sundarar. The temple also finds mention in Tirumular's Thirumantiram, Arunagirinathar's Tiruppugazh and Manikkavacakar's Tiruvacakam. Festivals The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Kalasanthi at 6:00 a.m., Irandam Kalm at 9:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m, Irandam Kalm at 7:30 p.m., and Arthajamam at 9:00 p.m.. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for Edaganathar and Elavrkuzhali. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham, and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Sundarar's miracle is celebrated every year as Mudalai Vaai Pillai Utsavam during Panguni Uththiram during the Tamil month of Panguni. The Car festival attracts large crowd and the festival car here is said to be on par with Tiruvarur. The procession of the 63 Nayanmars (Arupathi Moovar Ula) is another important festival celebrated here.

During his terms in office Letnick served over four years as British Columbia's Minister of Agriculture, the longest period in this portfolio of any BC Liberal. He was elected as a member of the BC Liberal Party in the riding of Kelowna-Lake Country. While his party formed a majority government in the 39th Parliament, Letnick was not initially included in the cabinet but was appointed to several committees, including the Select Standing Committee on Health where he was chair and tasked to report on the impacts of baby boomers and alternative strategies on the health care system. As a private member Letnick also introduced one piece of legislation, the Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act, which was adopted by government. This was the first time in six years that a private member was successful in introducing and getting legislation passed in the legislature. Prior to his election to the legislature, he was a business professor at the Okanagan School of Business. He graduated from Heriot-Watt University with a Master of Business Administration and achieved candidacy status toward a Doctorate in Health Economics with the University of British Columbia before setting the PhD aside to focus on his public duties as minister of agriculture. He served as a municipal councillor in the Town of Banff in the 1990s and in the City of Kelowna between 2005 and 2009. Background Born and raised in Montreal, Letnick is fluent in English and French. Letnick earned a living as a businessman, starting up several businesses before selling them including two H&R; Block franchises, a Motorola Dealership, a computer store and a video store. He married Helene in 1981 and they have three children and one granddaughter. He graduated in 1980 from the University of Calgary with a Bachelor of Commerce Degree and a nomination for a Rhodes Scholarship and then in 2002 from Scotland's Heriot-Watt University with a Master of Business Administration degree. In 2011 the University of British Columbia conferred upon him candidacy for a PhD in Health Economics. = Banff = Letnick was elected to the municipal council in Banff, Alberta in 1992, and re-elected in 1995. In Banff, he was an advocate for affordable housing, proper land use planning, and increased commercial development. He served as the chairman of Banff council's housing advisory committee and became the charter president of the non-profit Banff Housing Corporation and served as such for six years. As president he led the Banff Housing Corporation delivering affordable housing. He campaigned in favour of developing Banff by an additional 850,000 square feet of commercial space during a town-wide plebiscite, which was supported by the residents but reduced by the federal Minister of Canadian Heritage, Sheila Copps, who had jurisdiction over the development of Banff. In 1991 Letnick was a member of the Banff Mineral Springs Hospital board of directors. He was appointed chairman in 1995. As chair Letnick lead the hospital board through a strategic planning process, the creation of a new service agreement with the Regional Health Authority, and the hiring of a new CEO. He also led an initiative to stop the hospital from offering morning after pills in accordance with the guidelines of the owners of the hospital the Catholic Health Association of Canada. However, the initiative met with significant opposition and was abandoned later that year. In 1998 the 40-year-old Letnick ran for mayor of Banff and was the pre-election favorite, but came second to a 51-year-old lawyer. In Banff Letnick also served as president of the Banff Rotary Club, Secretary/Treasurer of the Banff Shrine Club, member of the Banff Lake Louise Tourism Bureau and member of the Knights of Columbus. =Kelowna= Letnick and his family moved to Kelowna, British Columbia in 1999 taking a faculty position at Okanagan University College teaching business administration. He participated in several community service organizations such as the Rotary and Gyro clubs. He was recruited to join Kelowna's Advisory Planning Commission, and was appointed to municipal task forces looking into access to the new Kelowna bridge and the downtown entertainment district. In the spring of 2005, with Member of Parliament Werner Schmidt announcing his retirement, Letnick sought the Conservative Party nomination in the Kelowna‚ÄîLake Country riding. Six other candidates ran, including Ben Stewart, Letnick placed second by 55 votes to Ron Cannan who went on to win the riding for the Conservatives. In the 2005 local government elections, he won a seat on the Kelowna City Council. In his efforts to get elected, Letnick campaign totalled $19,000 from cash and in-kind donations and visited an estimated 6,000 residents in a door-knocking campaign. Letnick was appointed to a two-person task force, with fellow councilor Michele Rule, to investigate and provide City Council with recommendations on affordable housing. In November 2006, they presented the results, eight recommendations which included density bonuses for developers and starting a municipal housing corporation. Based on the recommendations Kelowna council immediately decided to reserve 20% of a city-owned old school site for affordable housing development. On other local issues, Letnick voted against condominium development on agricultural land and voted in favour of holding a referendum on amalgamation with Westside which the council refused. Provincial politics Letnick began positioning himself in April 2008 to run for provincial office, informing his MLA Sindi Hawkins who had been diagnosed with cancer, that he would seek to replace her if she did not seek re- election. However, it was retiring MLA Al Horning in a neighbouring riding that asked Letnick to replace him. Letnick accepted and, as no one else contested, he was acclaimed BC Liberal candidate in the Kelowna‚ÄîLake Country riding. In the May 2009 election, Letnick defeated the New Democratic candidate Matthew Reed who was an audio engineer and instructor, the BC Conservative Party candidate Mary-Ann Graham who was a Rutland caf√© owner, the Green Party candidate Ryan Fugger who was a freelance software and web developer, and independent candidate and fruit farmer Alan Clarke. Letnick won his riding with 52% of the vote and his BC Liberal Party won its third consecutive majority government. In 2013 Letnick won his riding for a second term with 57% of the vote and was appointed parliamentary secretary to premier Clark responsible for Intergovernmental Affairs. =39th Parliament= As the 39th Parliament began, Premier Gordon Campbell did not include Letnick in the cabinet. For the first two sessions Letnick was appointed to serve on two committees: the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services. As part of the finance committee he traveled the province for public consultation regarding government budget prioritization. In the third and fourth sessions he was reassigned to the Select Standing Committee on Education and the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills - though neither committee was convened in third session and only the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills held a meeting in the fourth session. In Fall 2009 Letnick was appointed by Randy Hawes, fellow BC Liberal MLA and the Minister of State for Mining, to lead a committee investigating a management strategy for aggregate extraction and processing in the Central Okanagan area. Letnick distinguished himself from the BC Liberals in November 2009 when he voted against their Assistance to Shelter Act which allowed police to use force in taking a person at risk to emergency shelters. Letnick voted against the bill as \\"a matter of conscience\\" saying that he supported the current methods used and that the act may dis-locate persons into unfamiliar parts of town without a means to return. He still stands as the only MLA in the legislature since 2009 who has voted against his party. Letnick was a vocal proponent of independent power producers and of the Harmonized Sales Tax, though he delivered a local petition against the HST to the Legislative Assembly on behalf of some of the constituents in his riding and those of Westside Kelowna and Kelowna Mission. The unpopularity of the HST within his riding led to Letnick being included in a list of 24 MLAs, in June 2010, who the FightHST group would explore for potential recall. The group short-listed Letnick in their list of 18 MLAs, in September 2010, where they thought recall was possible ‚Äî though the group did not follow through with the recall campaign with Letnick. Following the resignation of party leader Gordon Campbell, the BC Liberal Party leadership election was held. Letnick endorsed George Abbott as soon as he entered the race, citing the respect Abbott has of people within and outside the party. Christy Clark won the leadership election and became Premier, but also did not include Letnick in her cabinet. However, Clark directed Letnick to chair the Select Standing Committee on Health with the specific task of assessing the sustainability of the health care system, given expected demographic trends, to 2036 and to report on potential alternative strategies. In May 2011, Letnick introduced a private member bill called the Emergency Intervention Disclosure Act (M-210) into the Legislative Assembly. The bill would have enabled people, like emergency workers or victims of crimes, to obtain blood tests from people who had their bodily fluids come in contact with them. Letnick cited encouragement from fire fighters and paramedics, as well as a Clark campaign pledge to debate more private member bills, as reasons for bringing the proposed legislation forward. The legislation only received first reading in the third session but Letnick brought it back in the fourth session as Bill M-204 in November 2011. Letnick's private members bill was picked up by government and passed unanimously as Bill 39 in May 2012, the first time in 6 years that a private member successfully introduced a Bill that became Law. In September 2012 Letnick was appointed Minister of Agriculture for the province of British Columbia.http://www.michelerule.ca/blog/2012/10/01/norm-letnick-minister-of- agriculture/  Electoral history ReferencesExternal links * Legislative Assembly of British Columbia - Norm Letnick * Member of the Legislative Assembly - Norm Letnick (Kelowna-Lake Country) * BC Liberal - Norm Letnick (Kelowna-Lake Country) Category:British Columbia Liberal Party MLAs Category:Living people Category:Kelowna city councillors Category:Members of the Executive Council of British Columbia Category:Politicians from Montreal Category:1957 births Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Norm Letnick"},{"id":"22784993","text":"The International Society of Zoological Sciences (ISZS) was founded to encourage research, education, and communication in zoology. The society includes both individual scholars, and professional organizations. It particularly tries to increase the availability of research resources and enhance cooperation between different branches of zoology.  History  To summarize from Francis Dov Por's \\"The Road to the International Society of Zoological Sciences\\" \\"Zoology ... was among the very first disciplines to build an international organization. Congresses of Zoology started in 1889 on the initiative of the Soci√©t√© zoologique de France on the occasion of the International Exposition in Paris. Congresses were then held at regular intervals and attendance increased from congress to congress, from a few tens in Paris and in Moscow to 700 in Budapest in 1927. The London Congress set a target of 1000 and in Washington the number reached 2500. The Congresses were also growing in complexity, resulting in part because of the emerging specialization of different fields of zoology. In London in 1958 there were eight to nine daily parallel sessions. In Washington an attempt was made to organize symposia instead and there were no less than 29: the problem of unifying subjects became more important than the numbers of participants. The Washington Congress decided that the Board of the Division of Zoology of the newly founded IUBS, would assume in the future the role of the 'Comite Permanent' and would be responsible for ensuring the continuity of Zoological Congresses. This did not work and the new International Congresses of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology (ICSEB) took over the role of the Zoological Congresses. A gallant effort was made in 1972 by Vaissiere and French colleagues to convene a XVII International Congress of Zoology in Monte Carlo. However, attendance was poor and the proceedings were never published. A long hiatus then began. An international focus became the problem of vanishing species. Instead, what followed in the next two decades was the vanishing of zoology from the international academic agenda. The names of university departments and research centers were rapidly changed in order to avoid use of the word 'zoology'. With the aid of modern communications and technology a reunification of the fractured specialties of zoology became possible. The concept of an integrative zoology, synthesizing data and results ranging from molecular biology to behavior, gained wide acceptance. The XVIII International Congress of Zoology was held in Athens in Greece in August 2000. The symposium program of the Congress presented a cross-zoological picture of the many levels of zoological inquiry, both horizontal and vertical. Attendance in Athens was far from the incommunicable thousands in the last congresses, but was considered by all as an unmitigated success. Subsequently, the IUBS approved the (re)formation of an international zoological body (the ISZS) as proposed by Zhibin Zhang, John Buckeridge and Francis Dov Por in Beijing in 2004, and an Executive Committee was elected and charged with organizing International Congresses of Zoology and providing a global voice for zoologists.\\"  Structure  As if at the end of 2013,the ISZS has 1032 individual members and 113 institutional members, having a coverage of over 30,000 zoologists, scientists and research workers all over the world. The Institutional Members include national zoological organizations, universities, non-governmental organizations and academies of science. ISZS is managed by an international Executive Committee.Official site of the ISZS The current President is Zhibin Zhang (China). Immediate Past Presidents include: Jean- Marc Jallon (France), John Buckeridge (Australia) and Dov Por (Israel). The Secretariat of the ISZS is located at C-506, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1 Beichen West Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100101, China. The current Secretary General is Chunxu Han (China).

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly from the riding of Vernon-Monashee in the 2009 provincial election. In the 39th Parliament of British Columbia, Foster was not named to Premier Gordon Campbell's cabinet, but he was appointed deputy whip. As a member of the Select Standing Committee on Legislative Initiatives which he voted to initiate province-wide referendum concerning the Harmonized Sales Tax. He was also a member of the Special Committee to Review the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, and the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills. Prior to his involvement with provincial politics, Foster served 12 years as municipal councillor and 3 years as mayor of Lumby, British Columbia. Background Originally from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Eric Foster moved to British Columbia and worked in the forestry industry. With his wife and son, Foster moved to Lumby, from Vernon, working at a Lumby lumber mill. In the 1990s he became an educational assistant helping to develop the forestry program at Charles Bloom Secondary School. He became a municipal councilor in Lumby in 1990 and was re-elected until 2002 when he ran for mayor but lost. He filed his nomination papers to run for mayor again in 2005 but, with no other person being nominated, he was acclaimed mayor. At the time, he noted downtown revitalization and building a road to connect the village with Silver Star Mountain resort as priorities. He represented Lumby on the Regional District of North Okanagan board of directors during his tenure as mayor. He fought the School Board who tried to close Charles Bloom Secondary School, in favour of busing student to the expanded secondary school in Vernon, as well as fought the proposed closure of Whitevale Elementary in rural Lumby. He resented what he saw as provincial downloading of responsibilities, like riparian area regulations and police funding. He supported Lumby participating in a new Regional District economic development function, but opted out of a Regional District emergency service function (opting to contract the service out to the City of Vernon). In 2008, he was again acclaimed as mayor, as no one else sought the position. In January 2009 he was acclaimed chair of the Regional District board of directors, however, as MLA Tom Christensen announced his retirement in the same month, Foster announced his intention to seek the BC Liberal nomination in up-coming provincial election. Provincial politics In nomination election was held in March and with over 800 BC Liberal Party members voting, Foster defeated four other candidates: Lumby councilor Deb Leroux, morning radio host Betty Selin, Coldstream businessman Michael Tindall, and lawyer Andrew Powell. He took a leave of absence from his job as mayor to campaign for the provincial election where he faced school-bus driver Mark Olsen for the New Democratic Party, computer analyst Huguette Allen for the BC Green Party, salesman Dean Skoreyko for the BC Conservative Party, retired Coldstream resident RJ Busch for the BC Refederation Party, and Armstrong butcher Gordon Campbell (non- affiliated). Premier and BC Liberal Party leader Gordon Campbell campaigned with Foster in Vernon but was involved in what was perceived as an offense joke at the expense of striking paramedics. Foster won the riding, with his BC Liberals winning all Okanagan-Shuswap ridings. The BC Liberals were re-elected to form another majority government. Beginning the 39th Parliament, Premier Campbell did not include Foster in his cabinet but he was named deputy whip for the Liberal caucus. Foster was also a member of the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and Private Bills in the first two sessions, and which met only once in each session. Foster was a member of the Special Committee to Review the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act which presented its report and recommendations in May 2010. Foster developed a feud with Nelson-Creston MLA Michelle Mungall who accused Foster of deceiving voters and of speaking very little in the legislature. He defended the introduction of the Harmonized Sales Tax but became a target for recall when an Anti-HST petition gathered more signature in the Vernon-Monashee riding than votes that elected him. He was member of the Select Standing Committee on Legislative Initiatives which was forced to deal with the Anti-HST petition. Along party lines, Foster and the BC Liberals in favour of initiating a province-wide referendum. Foster was among 13 BC Liberals left out during a late-October cabinet (and parliamentary secretary) shuffle by Premier Campbell. During the BC Liberal leadership election, following the resignation of Campbell, Foster endorsed George Abbott citing his profile as an Interior MLA, his team-building skills, and analytical decision-making. Christy Clark eventually won and, thus, became premier. She kept Foster as the deputy whip until September 2012 when he was promoted to government whip. Meanwhile, as the FightHST group continued to investigate a recall campaign against Foster, he accused the group of trying to \\"overthrow the government\\". On local issues, Foster lobbied in favour of locating a new regional correctional facility in Lumby, building a large new sports facility at Okanagan College, and was in favour of resolving overcrowding at the Vernon Jubilee Hospital.

Top row: Fisher, Keynes, Modigliani Middle row: Solow, Friedman, Schwartz Bottom row: Sargent, Fischer, Prescott Macroeconomic theory has its origins in the study of business cycles and monetary theory. In general, early theorists believed monetary factors could not affect real factors such as real output. John Maynard Keynes attacked some of these \\"classical\\" theories and produced a general theory that described the whole economy in terms of aggregates rather than individual, microeconomic parts. Attempting to explain unemployment and recessions, he noticed the tendency for people and businesses to hoard cash and avoid investment during a recession. He argued that this invalidated the assumptions of classical economists who thought that markets always clear, leaving no surplus of goods and no willing labor left idle. The generation of economists that followed Keynes synthesized his theory with neoclassical microeconomics to form the neoclassical synthesis. Although Keynesian theory originally omitted an explanation of price levels and inflation, later Keynesians adopted the Phillips curve to model price-level changes. Some Keynesians opposed the synthesis method of combining Keynes's theory with an equilibrium system and advocated disequilibrium models instead. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, adopted some Keynesian ideas, such as the importance of the demand for money, but argued that Keynesians ignored the role of money supply in inflation. Robert Lucas and other new classical macroeconomists criticized Keynesian models that did not work under rational expectations. Lucas also argued that Keynesian empirical models would not be as stable as models based on microeconomic foundations. The new classical school culminated in real business cycle theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles are driven by changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective on the state of the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.  Origins  Early monetary theorists Alfred Marshall, Arthur Cecil Pigou, and Keynes were based at University of Cambridge. Pigou and Keynes were associated with the constituent King's College (chapel shown above). Macroeconomics descends from two areas of research: business cycle theory and monetary theory. Monetary theory dates back to the 16th century and the work of Mart√≠n de Azpilcueta, while business cycle analysis dates from the mid 19th. = Business cycle theory = Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Cl√©ment Juglar in the 1860s, economists attempted to explain the cycles of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone in this endeavor was the foundation of the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, statistical models of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of economic theory) that led to the discovery of apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave. Other economists focused more on theory in their business cycle analysis. Most business cycle theories focused on a single factor, such as monetary policy or the impact of weather on the largely agricultural economies of the time. Although business cycle theory was well established by the 1920s, work by theorists such as Dennis Robertson and Ralph Hawtrey had little impact on public policy. Their partial equilibrium theories could not capture general equilibrium, where markets interact with each other; in particular, early business cycle theories treated goods markets and financial markets separately. Research in these areas used microeconomic methods to explain employment, price level, and interest rates. = Monetary theory = Initially, the relationship between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold‚Äîin short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This was consistent with the classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an economy would be expected only to raise prices, not to create more goods. The quantity theory of money dominated macroeconomic theory until the 1930s. Two versions were particularly influential, one developed by Irving Fisher in works that included his 1911 The Purchasing Power of Money and another by Cambridge economists over the course of the early 20th century. Fisher's version of the quantity theory can be expressed by holding money velocity (the frequency with which a given piece of currency is used in transactions) (V) and real income (Q) constant and allowing money supply (M) and the price level (P) to vary in the equation of exchange: :M\\\\cdot V = P\\\\cdot Q Most classical theories, including Fisher's, held that velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge this assumption. They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money demand and how it impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did not assume that money demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring in the value of holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant steps toward the concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions and to maintain liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory. In 1898, Knut Wicksell proposed a monetary theory centered on interest rates. His analysis used two rates: the market interest rate, determined by the banking system, and the real or \\"natural\\" interest rate, determined by the rate of return on capital. In Wicksell's theory, cumulative inflation will occur when technical innovation causes the natural rate to rise or when the banking system allows the market rate to fall. Cumulative deflation occurs under the opposite conditions causing the market rate to rise above the natural. Wicksell's theory did not produce a direct relationship between the quantity of money and price level. According to Wicksell, money would be created endogenously, without an increase in quantity of hard currency, as long as the natural exceeded the market interest rate . In these conditions, borrowers turn a profit and deposit cash into bank reserves, which expands money supply. This can lead to a cumulative process where inflation increases continuously without an expansion in the monetary base. Wicksell's work influenced Keynes and the Swedish economists of the Stockholm School.  Keynes's General Theory  Keynes (right) with Harry Dexter White, assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury, at a 1946 International Monetary Fund meeting Modern macroeconomics can be said to have begun with Keynes and the publication of his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. Keynes expanded on the concept of liquidity preferences and built a general theory of how the economy worked. Keynes's theory was brought together both monetary and real economic factors for the first time, explained unemployment, and suggested policy achieving economic stability. Keynes contended that economic output is positively correlated with money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment. Classical economists had difficulty explaining involuntary unemployment and recessions because they applied Say's Law to the labor market and expected that all those willing to work at the prevailing wage would be employed. In Keynes's model, employment and output are driven by aggregate demand, the sum of consumption and investment. Since consumption remains stable, most fluctuations in aggregate demand stem from investment, which is driven by many factors including expectations, \\"animal spirits\\", and interest rates. Keynes argued that fiscal policy could compensate for this volatility. During downturns, government could increase spending to purchase excess goods and employ idle labor. Moreover, a multiplier effect increases the effect of this direct spending since newly employed workers would spend their income, which would percolate through the economy, while firms would invest to respond to this increase in demand. Keynes's prescription for strong public investment had ties to his interest in uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors paid little attention to the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory. The exact meaning of Keynes's work has been long debated. Even the interpretation of Keynes's policy prescription for unemployment, one of the more explicit parts of General Theory, has been the subject of debates. Economists and scholars debate whether Keynes intended his advice to be a major policy shift to address a serious problem or a moderately conservative solution to deal with a minor issue.  Keynes's successors  Keynes's successors debated the exact formulations, mechanisms, and consequences of the Keynesian model. One group emerged representing the \\"orthodox\\" interpretation of Keynes; They combined classical microeconomics with Keynesian thought to produce the \\"neoclassical synthesis\\" that dominated economics from the 1940s until the early 1970s. Two camps of Keynesians were critical of this synthesis interpretation of Keynes. One group focused on the disequilibrium aspects of Keynes's work, while the other took a fundamentalist stance on Keynes and began the heterodox post-Keynesian tradition. = Neoclassical synthesis = The generation of economists that followed Keynes, the neo-Keynesians, created the \\"neoclassical synthesis\\" by combining Keynes's macroeconomics with neoclassical microeconomics. Neo-Keynesians dealt with two microeconomic issues: first, providing foundations for aspects of Keynesian theory such as consumption and investment, and, second, combining Keynesian macroeconomics with general equilibrium theory. (In general equilibrium theory, individual markets interact with one another and an equilibrium price exists if there is perfect competition, no externalities, and perfect information.) Paul Samuelson's Foundations of Economic Analysis (1947) provided much of the microeconomic basis for the synthesis. Samuelson's work set the pattern for the methodology used by neo-Keynesians: economic theories expressed in formal, mathematical models. While Keynes's theories prevailed in this period, his successors largely abandoned his informal methodology in favor of Samuelson's. By the mid 1950s, the vast majority of economists had ceased debating Keynesianism and accepted the synthesis view; however, room for disagreement remained. The synthesis attributed problems with market clearing to sticky prices that failed to adjust to changes in supply and demand. Another group of Keynesians focused on disequilibrium economics and tried to reconcile the concept of equilibrium with the absence of market clearing. = Neo-Keynesian models = IS/LM chart with an upward shift in the IS curve. The chart illustrates how a shift in the IS curve, caused by factors like increased government spending or private investment, will lead to higher output (Y) and increased interest rates (i). In 1937 John Hicks published an article that incorporated Keynes's thought into a general equilibrium framework where the markets for goods and money met in an overall equilibrium. Hick's IS/LM (Investment-Savings/Liquidity preference-Money supply) model became the basis for decades of theorizing and policy analysis into the 1960s. The model represents the goods market with the IS curve, a set of points representing equilibrium in investment and savings. The money market equilibrium is represented with the LM curve, a set of points representing the equilibrium in supply and demand for money. The intersection of the curves identifies an aggregate equilibrium in the economy where there are unique equilibrium values for interest rates and economic output. The IS/LM model focused on interest rates as the \\"monetary transmission mechanism,\\" the channel through which money supply affects real variables like aggregate demand and employment. A decrease in money supply would lead to higher interest rates, which reduce investment and thereby lower output throughout the economy. Other economists built on the IS/LM framework. Notably, in 1944, Franco Modigliani added a labor market. Modigliani's model represented the economy as a system with general equilibrium across the interconnected markets for labor, finance, and goods, and it explained unemployment with rigid nominal wages. Growth had been of interest to 18th-century classical economists like Adam Smith, but work tapered off during the 19th and early 20th century marginalist revolution when researchers focused on microeconomics. The study of growth revived when neo- Keynesians Roy Harrod and Evsey Domar independently developed the Harrod‚ÄìDomar model, an extension of Keynes's theory to the long-run, an area Keynes had not looked at himself. Their models combined Keynes's multiplier with an accelerator model of investment, and produced the simple result that growth equaled the savings rate divided by the capital output ratio (the amount of capital divided by the amount of output). The Harrod‚ÄìDomar model dominated growth theory until Robert Solow and Trevor Swan independently developed neoclassical growth models in 1956. Solow and Swan produced a more empirically appealing model with \\"balanced growth\\" based on the substitution of labor and capital in production. Solow and Swan suggested that increased savings could only temporarily increase growth, and only technological improvements could increase growth in the long-run. After Solow and Swan, growth research tapered off with little or no research on growth from 1970 until 1985. Economists incorporated the theoretical work from the synthesis into large-scale macroeconometric models that combined individual equations for factors such as consumption, investment, and money demand with empirically observed data. This line of research reached its height with the MIT-Penn-Social Science Research Council (MPS) model developed by Modigliani and his collaborators. MPS combined IS/LM with other aspects of the synthesis including the neoclassical growth model and the Phillips curve relation between inflation and output. Both large-scale models and the Phillips curve became targets for critics of the synthesis. = Phillips curve = The US economy in the 1960s followed the Phillips curve, a correlation between inflation and unemployment. Keynes did not lay out an explicit theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little concern in the 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set the basis for a price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system. = Disequilibrium macroeconomics = Despite its prevalence, the neoclassical synthesis had its Keynesian critics. A strain of disequilibrium or \\"non-Walrasian\\" theory developed that criticized the synthesis for apparent contradictions in allowing disequilibrium phenomena, especially involuntary unemployment, to be modeled in equilibrium models. Moreover, they argued, the presence of disequilibrium in one market must be associated with disequilibrium in another, so involuntary unemployment had to be tied to an excess supply in the goods market. Many see Don Patinkin's work as the first in the disequilibrium vein. Robert W. Clower (1965) introduced his \\"dual-decision hypothesis\\" that a person in a market may determine what he wants to buy, but is ultimately limited in how much he can buy based on how much he can sell. Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud (1968) argued that disequilibrium formed a fundamental part of Keynes's theory and deserved greater attention. Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman formulated general disequilibrium models in which individual markets were locked into prices before there was a general equilibrium. These markets produced \\"false prices\\" resulting in disequilibrium. Soon after the work of Barro and Grossman, disequilibrium models fell out of favor in the United States, and Barro abandoned Keynesianism and adopted new classical, market clearing hypotheses. Diagram based on Malinvaud's typology of unemployment shows curves for equilibrium in the goods and labor markets given wage and price levels. Walrasian equilibrium is achieved when both markets are at equilibrium. According to Malinvaud the economy is usually in a state of either Keynesian unemployment, with excess supply of goods and labor, or classical unemployment, with excess supply of labor and excess demand for goods. While American economists quickly abandoned disequilibrium models, European economists were more open to models without market clearing. Europeans such as Edmond Malinvaud and Jacques Dr√®ze expanded on the disequilibrium tradition and worked to explain price rigidity instead of simply assuming it. Malinvaud (1977) used disequilibrium analysis to develop a theory of unemployment. He argued that disequilibrium in the labor and goods markets could lead to rationing of goods and labor, leading to unemployment. Malinvaud adopted a fixprice framework and argued that pricing would be rigid in modern, industrial prices compared to the relatively flexible pricing systems of raw goods that dominate agricultural economies. Prices are fixed and only quantities adjust. Malinvaud considers an equilibrium state in classical and Keynesian unemployment as most likely. Work in the neoclassical tradition is confined as a special case of Malinvaud's typology, the Walrasian equilibrium. In Malinvaud's theory, reaching the Walrasian equilibrium case is almost impossible to achieve given the nature of industrial pricing.  Monetarism  Milton Friedman developed an alternative to Keynesian macroeconomics eventually labeled monetarism. Generally monetarism is the idea that the supply of money matters for the macroeconomy. When monetarism emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, Keynesians neglected the role money played in inflation and the business cycle, and monetarism directly challenged those points. = Criticizing and augmenting the Phillips curve = The Phillips curve appeared to reflect a clear, inverse relationship between inflation and output. The curve broke down in the 1970s as economies suffered simultaneous economic stagnation and inflation known as stagflation. The empirical implosion of the Phillips curve followed attacks mounted on theoretical grounds by Friedman and Edmund Phelps. Phelps, although not a monetarist, argued that only unexpected inflation or deflation impacted employment. Variations of Phelps's \\"expectations-augmented Phillips curve\\" became standard tools. Friedman and Phelps used models with no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Instead of the Phillips curve they used models based on the natural rate of unemployment where expansionary monetary policy can only temporarily shift unemployment below the natural rate. Eventually, firms will adjust their prices and wages for inflation based on real factors, ignoring nominal changes from monetary policy. The expansionary boost will be wiped out. = Importance of money = Anna Schwartz collaborated with Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money supply to the business cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high during much of the Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative. Friedman developed his own quantity theory of money that referred to Irving Fisher's but inherited much from Keynes. Friedman's 1956 \\"The Quantity Theory of Money: A Restatement\\" incorporated Keynes's demand for money and liquidity preference into an equation similar to the classical equation of exchange. Friedman's updated quantity theory also allowed for the possibility of using monetary or fiscal policy to remedy a major downturn. Friedman broke with Keynes by arguing that money demand is relatively stable‚Äîeven during a downturn. Monetarists argued that \\"fine-tuning\\" through fiscal and monetary policy is counterproductive. They found money demand to be stable even during fiscal policy shifts, and both fiscal and monetary policies suffer from lags that made them too slow to prevent mild downturns. = Prominence and decline = Money velocity had been stable and grew consistently until around 1980 (green). After 1980 (blue), money velocity became erratic and the monetarist assumption of stable money velocity was called into question. Monetarism attracted the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting money supply instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.  New classical economics  Much of new classical research was conducted at the University of Chicago. \\"New classical economics\\" evolved from monetarism and presented other challenges to Keynesianism. Early new classicals considered themselves monetarists, but the new classical school evolved. New classicals abandoned the monetarist belief that monetary policy could systematically impact the economy, and eventually embraced real business cycle models that ignored monetary factors entirely. New classicals broke with Keynesian economic theory completely while monetarists had built on Keynesian ideas. Despite discarding Keynesian theory, new classical economists did share the Keynesian focus on explaining short-run fluctuations. New classicals replaced monetarists as the primary opponents to Keynesianism and changed the primary debate in macroeconomics from whether to look at short-run fluctuations to whether macroeconomic models should be grounded in microeconomic theories. Like monetarism, new classical economics was rooted at the University of Chicago, principally with Robert Lucas. Other leaders in the development of new classical economics include Edward Prescott at University of Minnesota and Robert Barro at University of Rochester. New classical economists wrote that earlier macroeconomic theory was based only tenuously on microeconomic theory and described its efforts as providing \\"microeconomic foundations for macroeconomics.\\" New classicals also introduced rational expectations and argued that governments had little ability to stabilize the economy given the rational expectations of economic agents. Most controversially, new classical economists revived the market clearing assumption, assuming both that prices are flexible and that the market should be modeled at equilibrium. = Rational expectations and policy irrelevance = John Muth first proposed rational expectations when he criticized the cobweb model (example above) of agricultural prices. Muth showed that agents making decisions based on rational expectations would be more successful than those who made their estimates based on adaptive expectations, which could lead to the cobweb situation above where decisions about producing quantities (Q) lead to prices (P) spiraling out of control away from the equilibrium of supply (S) and demand (D). Keynesians and monetarists recognized that people based their economic decisions on expectations about the future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior as if it were backward- looking while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy. Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (1975) applied rational expectations to models with Phillips curve trade-offs between inflation and output and found that monetary policy could not be used to systematically stabilize the economy. Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated monetary policy could increase employment, and no central bank could systematically use monetary policy for expansion without economic agents catching on and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact. Robert E. Hall applied rational expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base the level of their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption. = The Lucas critique and microfoundations = In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing large-scale Keynesian models used for forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further and argued that a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships. = Lucas supply theory and business cycle models = Lucas and Leonard Rapping laid out the first new classical approach to aggregate supply in 1969. Under their model, changes in employment are based on worker preferences for leisure time. Lucas and Rapping modeled decreases in employment as voluntary choices of workers to reduce their work effort in response to the prevailing wage. Lucas (1973) proposed a business cycle theory based on rational expectations, imperfect information, and market clearing. While building this model, Lucas attempted to incorporate the empirical fact that there had been a trade-off between inflation and output without ceding that money was non-neutral in the short-run. This model included the idea of money surprise: monetary policy only matters when it causes people to be surprised or confused by the price of goods changing relative to one another. Lucas hypothesized that producers become aware of changes in their own industries before they recognize changes in other industries. Given this assumption, a producer might perceive an increase in general price level as an increase in the demand for his goods. The producer responds by increasing production only to find the \\"surprise\\" that prices had increased across the economy generally rather than specifically for his goods. This \\"Lucas supply curve\\" models output as a function of the \\"price\\" or \\"money surprise,\\" the difference between expected and actual inflation. Lucas's \\"surprise\\" business cycle theory fell out of favor after the 1970s when empirical evidence failed to support this model. = Real business cycle theory = George W. Bush meets Kydland (left) and Prescott (center) at an Oval Office ceremony in 2004 honoring the year's Nobel Laureates. While \\"money surprise\\" models floundered, efforts continued to develop a new classical model of the business cycle. A 1982 paper by Kydland and Prescott introduced real business cycle theory (RBC). Under this theory business cycles could be explained entirely by the supply side, and models represented the economy with systems at constant equilibrium. RBC dismissed the need to explain business cycles with price surprise, market failure, price stickiness, uncertainty, and instability. Instead, Kydland and Prescott built parsimonious models that explained business cycles with changes in technology and productivity. Employment levels changed because these technological and productivity changes altered the desire of people to work. RBC rejected the idea of high involuntary unemployment in recessions and not only dismissed the idea that money could stabilize the economy but also the monetarist idea that money could destabilize it. Real business cycle modelers sought to build macroeconomic models based on microfoundations of Arrow‚ÄìDebreu general equilibrium. RBC models were one of the inspirations for dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. DSGE models have become a common methodological tool for macroeconomists‚Äîeven those who disagree with new classical theory.  New Keynesian economics  New classical economics had pointed out the inherent contradiction of the neoclassical synthesis: Walrasian microeconomics with market clearing and general equilibrium could not lead to Keynesian macroeconomics where markets failed to clear. New Keynesians recognized this paradox, but, while the new classicals abandoned Keynes, new Keynesians abandoned Walras and market clearing. During the late 1970s and 1980s, new Keynesian researchers investigated how market imperfections like monopolistic competition, nominal frictions like sticky prices, and other frictions made microeconomics consistent with Keynesian macroeconomics. New Keynesians often formulated models with rational expectations, which had been proposed by Lucas and adopted by new classical economists. = Nominal and real rigidities = Stanley Fischer (1977) responded to Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's monetary ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy even in a model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects‚Äîeven after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories were based on the basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate. By the 1980s new Keynesian economists became dissatisfied with these early nominal wage contract models since they predicted that real wages would be countercyclical (real wages would rise when the economy fell), while empirical evidence showed that real wages tended to be independent of economic cycles or even slightly procyclical. These contract models also did not make sense from a microeconomic standpoint since it was unclear why firms would use long-term contracts if they led to inefficiencies. Instead of looking for rigidities in the labor market, new Keynesians shifted their attention to the goods market and the sticky prices that resulted from \\"menu cost\\" models of price change. The term refers to the literal cost to a restaurant of printing new menus when it wants to change prices; however, economists also use it to refer to more general costs associated with changing prices, including the expense of evaluating whether to make the change. Since firms must spend money to change prices, they do not always adjust them to the point where markets clear, and this lack of price adjustments can explain why the economy may be in disequilibrium. Studies using data from the United States Consumer Price Index confirmed that prices do tend to be sticky. A good's price typically changes about every four to six months or, if sales are excluded, every eight to eleven months. While some studies suggested that menu costs are too small to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level. = Coordination failure = In this model of coordination failure, a representative firm ei makes its output decisions based on the average output of all firms (ƒì). When the representative firm produces as much as the average firm (ei=ƒì), the economy is at an equilibrium represented by the 45-degree line. The decision curve intersects with the equilibrium line at three equilibrium points. The firms could coordinate and produce at the optimal level of point B, but, without coordination, firms might produce at a less efficient equilibrium. Coordination failure is another potential explanation for recessions and unemployment. In recessions a factory can go idle even though there are people willing to work in it, and people willing to buy its production if they had jobs. In such a scenario, economic downturns appear to be the result of coordination failure: The invisible hand fails to coordinate the usual, optimal, flow of production and consumption. Russell Cooper and Andrew John (1988) expressed a general form of coordination as models with multiple equilibria where agents could coordinate to improve (or at least not harm) each of their respective situations. Cooper and John based their work on earlier models including Peter Diamond's (1982) coconut model, which demonstrated a case of coordination failure involving search and matching theory. In Diamond's model producers are more likely to produce if they see others producing. The increase in possible trading partners increases the likelihood of a given producer finding someone to trade with. As in other cases of coordination failure, Diamond's model has multiple equilibria, and the welfare of one agent is dependent on the decisions of others. Diamond's model is an example of a \\"thick-market externality\\" that causes markets to function better when more people and firms participate in them. Other potential sources of coordination failure include self-fulfilling prophecies. If a firm anticipates a fall in demand, they might cut back on hiring. A lack of job vacancies might worry workers who then cut back on their consumption. This fall in demand meets the firm's expectations, but it is entirely due to the firm's own actions. = Labor market failures = New Keynesians offered explanations for the failure of the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.  Insider-outsider model  Economists became interested in hysteresis when unemployment levels spiked with the 1979 oil shock and early 1980s recessions but did not return to the lower levels that had been considered the natural rate. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers (1986) explained hysteresis in unemployment with insider-outsider models, which were also proposed by of Assar Lindbeck and Dennis Snower in a series of papers and then a book. Insiders, employees already working at a firm, are only concerned about their own welfare. They would rather keep their wages high than cut pay and expand employment. The unemployed, outsiders, do not have any voice in the wage bargaining process, so their interests are not represented. When unemployment increases, the number of outsiders increases as well. Even after the economy has recovered, outsiders continue to be disenfranchised from the bargaining process. The larger pool of outsiders created by periods of economic retraction can lead to persistently higher levels of unemployment. The presence of hysteresis in the labor market also raises the importance of monetary and fiscal policy. If temporary downturns in the economy can create long term increases in unemployment, stabilization policies do more than provide temporary relief; they prevent short term shocks from becoming long term increases in unemployment.  Efficiency wages  In the Shapiro- Stiglitz model workers are paid at a level where they do not shirk, preventing wages from dropping to full employment levels. The curve for the no-shirking condition (labeled NSC) goes to infinity at full employment. In efficiency wage models, workers are paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might pay more than a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having to move to a new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.  New growth theory  Empirical evidence showed that growth rates of low income countries varied widely instead of converging to a uniform income level as expected in earlier, neoclassical models. Following research on the neoclassical growth model in the 1950s and 1960s, little work on economic growth occurred until 1985. Papers by Paul Romer were particularly influential in igniting the revival of growth research. Beginning in the mid-1980s and booming in the early 1990s many macroeconomists shifted their focus to the long-run and started \\"new growth\\" theories, including endogenous growth. Growth economists sought to explain empirical facts including the failure of sub-Saharan Africa to catch up in growth, the booming East Asian Tigers, and the slowdown in productivity growth in the United States prior to the technology boom of the 1990s. Convergence in growth rates had been predicted under the neoclassical growth model, and this apparent predictive failure inspired research into endogenous growth. Three families of new growth models challenged neoclassical models. The first challenged the assumption of previous models that the economic benefits of capital would decrease over time. These early new growth models incorporated positive externalities to capital accumulation where one firm's investment in technology generates spillover benefits to other firms because knowledge spreads. The second focused on the role of innovation in growth. These models focused on the need to encourage innovation through patents and other incentives. A third set, referred to as the \\"neoclassical revival\\", expanded the definition of capital in exogenous growth theory to include human capital. This strain of research began with Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992), which showed that 78% of the cross- country variance in growth could be explained by a Solow model augmented with human capital. Endogenous growth theories implied that countries could experience rapid \\"catch-up\\" growth through an open society that encouraged the inflow of technology and ideas from other nations. Endogenous growth theory also suggested that governments should intervene to encourage investment in research and development because the private sector might not invest at optimal levels.  New synthesis  impulse response functions show the effects of a one standard deviation monetary policy shock on other economic variables over 20 quarters. A \\"new synthesis\\" or \\"new neoclassical synthesis\\" emerged in the 1990s drawing ideas from both the new Keynesian and new classical schools. From the new classical school, it adapted RBC hypotheses, including rational expectations, and methods; from the new Keynesian school, it took nominal rigidities (price stickiness) and other market imperfections. The new synthesis implies that monetary policy can have a stabilizing effect on the economy, contrary to new classical theory. The new synthesis was adopted by academic economists and soon by policy makers, such as central bankers. Under the synthesis, debates have become less ideological (concerning fundamental methodological questions) and more empirical. Woodford described the change: Woodford emphasised that there was now a stronger distinction between works of data characterisation, which make no claims regarding their the results' relationship to specific economic decisions, and structural models, where a model with a theoretical basis attempts describe actual relationships and decisions being made by economic actors. The validation of structural models now requires that their specifications reflect \\"explicit decision problems faced by households or firms\\". Data characterisation, Woodford says, proves useful in \\"establishing facts structural models should be expected to explain\\" but not as a tool of policy analysis. Rather it is structural models, explaining those facts in terms of real-life decisions by agents, that form the basis of policy analysis. New synthesis theory developed RBC models called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, which avoid the Lucas critique. DSGE models formulate hypotheses about the behaviors and preferences of firms and households; numerical solutions of the resulting DSGE models are computed. These models also included a \\"stochastic\\" element created by shocks to the economy. In the original RBC models these shocks were limited to technological change, but more recent models have incorporated other real changes. Econometric analysis of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that monetary policy explained only a small part of the fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks can affect both demand and supply. More recent developments in new synthesis modelling has included the development of heterogenous agent models, used in monetary policy optimisation: these models examine the implications of having distinct groups of consumers with different savings behaviour within a population on the transmission of monetary policy through an economy.https://copenhagenmacro.dk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/debortoli-1.pdf  2008 financial crisis, Great Recession, and the evolution of consensus  The 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession challenged the short-term macroeconomics of the time. Few economists predicted the crisis, and, even afterwards, there was great disagreement on how to address it. The new synthesis formed during the Great Moderation and had not been tested in a severe economic environment. Many economists agree that the crisis stemmed from an economic bubble, but neither of the major macroeconomic schools within the synthesis had paid much attention to finance or a theory of asset bubbles. The failures of economic theory at the time to explain the crisis spurred economists to reevaluate their thinking. Commentary ridiculed the mainstream and proposed a major reassessment. Particular criticism during the crisis was directed at DSGE models, which were developed prior to and during the new synthesis. Robert Solow testified before the U.S. Congress that DSGE modeling \\"has nothing useful to say about anti-recession policy because it has built into its essentially implausible assumptions the 'conclusion' that there is nothing for macroeconomic policy to do.\\" Solow also criticized DSGE models for frequently assuming that a single, \\"representative agent\\" can represent the complex interaction of the many diverse agents that make up the real world. Robert Gordon criticized much of macroeconomics after 1978. Gordon called for a renewal of disequilibrium theorizing and disequilibrium modeling. He disparaged both new classical and new Keynesian economists who assumed that markets clear; he called for a renewal of economic models that could included both market clearing and sticky-priced goods, such as oil and housing respectively. The crisis did not dismantle the deeper consensus that characterised the new synthesis,This consisting of: that macroeconomic analysis should use models with intertemporal and general-equilibrum foundations, that quantitative policy analysis should use econometrically validated structural models, that expectations should be modelled as endogenous, that real factors can cause shocks to both supply and demand, and that monetary policy is effective (as opposed to the view that it has no effects) and models which could explain the new data continued development. Areas that had seen increased popular and political attention, such as income inequality, received greater focus, as did models which incorporated significant heterogenity (as opposed to earlier DSGE models).https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/sites/faculty- research/files/finance/Macro%20Workshop/Catch22_HANK_wDSGE_1503208.pdf Whilst criticising DGSE models, Ricardo J. Caballero argued that work in finance showed progress and suggested that modern macroeconomics needed to be re- centered but not scrapped in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2010, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis president Narayana Kocherlakota acknowledged that DSGE models were \\"not very useful\\" for analyzing the financial crisis of 2007-2010, but argued that the applicability of these models was \\"improving\\" and claimed that there was a growing consensus among macroeconomists that DSGE models need to incorporate both \\"price stickiness and financial market frictions.\\"Kocherlakota (2010) Despite his criticism of DSGE modelling, he stated that modern models are useful: University of Minnesota professor of economics V.V. Chari said in 2010 that the most advanced DSGE models allowed for significant heterogeneity in behaviour and decisions, from factors such as age, prior experiences and available information. Alongside such improvements in DSGE modelling, work has also included the development of heterogenous-agent models of more specific aspects of the economy, such as monetary policy transmission.https://copenhagenmacro.dk/wp- content/uploads/2017/09/debortoli-1.pdfhttps://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty- research/sites/faculty- research/files/finance/Macro%20Workshop/Catch22_HANK_wDSGE_1503208.pdf  Heterodox theories  Heterodox economists adhere to theories sufficiently outside the mainstream to be marginalized and treated as irrelevant by the establishment. Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created insular groups in the late 1960s and 1970s. Present day heterodox economists often publish in their own journals rather than those of the mainstream and eschew formal modeling in favor of more abstract theoretical work. According to The Economist, the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession highlighted limitations of the macroeconomic theories, models, and econometrics of the time. The popular press during the period discussed post- Keynesian economics and Austrian economics, two heterodox traditions that have little influence on mainstream economics. = Post Keynesian economics = While neo-Keynesians integrated Keynes's ideas with neoclassical theory, post- Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes that sought to develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post- Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the ergodic axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality of money in the short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes cause people to shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The ergodic axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based on the past and present market conditions. Without the ergodic assumption, agents are unable to form rational expectations, undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are very hard to make and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on sticky prices and wages than new Keynesians. They do not see nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think sticky prices and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including safety nets and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post- Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting in a financial crisis. The financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work. = Austrian business cycle theory = Friedrich Hayek, founder of Austrian business cycle theory The Austrian School of economics began with Carl Menger's 1871 Principles of Economics. Menger's followers formed a distinct group of economists until around the World War II when the distinction between Austrian economics and other schools of thought had largely broken down. The Austrian tradition survived as a distinct school, however, through the works of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Present- day Austrians are distinguished by their interest in earlier Austrian works and abstention from standard empirical methodology including econometrics. Austrians also focus on market processes instead of equilibrium. Mainstream economists are generally critical of its methodology. Hayek created the Austrian business cycle theory, which synthesizes Menger's capital theory and Mises's theory of money and credit. The theory proposes a model of inter- temporal investment in which production plans precede the manufacture of the finished product. The producers revise production plans to adapt to changes in consumer preferences. Producers respond to \\"derived demand,\\" which is estimated demand for the future, instead of current demand. If consumers reduce their spending, producers believe that consumers are saving for additional spending later, so that production remains constant. Combined with a market of loanable funds (which relates savings and investment through the interest rate), this theory of capital production leads to a model of the macroeconomy where markets reflect inter-temporal preferences. Hayek's model suggests that an economic bubble begins when cheap credit initiates a boom where resources are misallocated, so that early stages of production receive more resources than they should and overproduction begins; the later stages of capital are not funded for maintenance to prevent depreciation. Overproduction in the early stages cannot be processed by poorly maintained later stage capital. The boom becomes a bust when a lack of finished goods leads to \\"forced saving\\" since fewer finished goods can be produced for sale.

He played college football at Rice University. Early years Barnes attended Carver High School (Waco, Texas), where he received 3A second-team All-State honors in football. He also practiced track. He accepted a football scholarship from Rice University, where at the time he was one of only four African-American players. He was named the starter at middle linebacker as a sophomore, but failed one course and had two D's, which forced the school to make him ineligible to play for 1970 season. At one point, he considered transferring to the University of Southern California. As a junior, Barnes became the first African-American to be named to the All-SWC defensive team. In his senior year, he was limited with a knee injury and a bruised a kidney he suffered against Louisiana State University. In college, he was seen as outspoken and undisciplined at times. He was also one of the organizers of the Black Student Union and was part of a movement to pressure the University to hire more African-American teachers and coaches. In 2011, he was inducted into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional careerDallas Cowboys= He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round (176th overall) of the 1973 NFL Draft, after he dropped because teams were cautious of his civil rights activism. His athletic ability and production, propelled him to become the second African-American linebacker to make the team in franchise history (Ralph Coleman was the first). Barnes could play all three linebacker positions, but he mainly competed for the middle linebacker position against Lee Roy Jordan and was a core special teams player. His best moments came in the 1973 preseason; against the Miami Dolphins, he helped stop Larry Csonka three times in a row, during a 2-yard goal-line stand and against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had 11 tackles (3 for loss) and hit backup quarterback Dean Carlson to the sidelines under the bench, which the referees thought Carlson was out of the playing field and flagged Barnes with a 15-yard personal foul penalty. In March 1974, he was selected by the Florida Blazers in the 13th round (145th overall) of the WFL Pro Draft. His relationship with the Cowboys also started to deteriorate, with his growing belief that racial reasons were the main cause of him remaining in a reserve role. In October, he left training camp in a disagreement over playing time and salary, while also informing the team that at the recommendation of his personal doctor he was going to have knee surgery for an injury suffered in the last game of 1973. He eventually was released on November 11. =New England Patriots (first stint)= On November 11, 1974, he was claimed off waivers by the New England Patriots. =Charlotte Hornets (WFL)= In 1975, Barnes played in 2 games for the Charlotte Hornets of the World Football League, until the league ceased operations at the mid-season point in 1975. =New England Patriots (second stint)= In 1975, he signed with the New England Patriots and was waived after the season opener on September 24. =Miami Dolphins= On November 19, 1975, he was signed as a free agent by the Miami Dolphins. On April 6, 1976, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for a twelfth round draft choice (#342-Darryl Brandford). =St. Louis Cardinals= The St. Louis Cardinals released him on September 2, 1976. =Oakland Raiders= On November 15, 1976, the Oakland Raiders signed him as a free agent because of injuries in the linebacking corps. He was a part of the Super Bowl XI winning team, playing mainly on special teams. Injuries forced him to retire in 1977.

He is the Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations, and Rural Development in British Columbia, a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia and a member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly from the riding of Stikine in the 2009 provincial election and re-elected in the 2013 and 2017 elections. With the New Democratic Party assuming Government as of July 18, 2017, he opened the 41st Parliament of British Columbia under Premier John Horgan on September 11, 2017. During the 39th Parliament of British Columbia he served as deputy chair of the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services which did public consultation regarding government budget and spending priorities. With his party forming the Official Opposition in the 39th Parliament, Donaldson has served as the critic of Mines since July 2012, deputy critic on Energy since April 2011, as well as deputy critic on Finance between June 2009 and July 2012. During the 40th Parliament, beginning in 2013 he was reassigned as Official Opposition spokesman for the Ministry of Children & Family Development. In 2016 he became the Official Opposition spokesman for Energy and Mines. Prior to becoming an MLA, Donaldson had lived in numerous towns in British Columbia, including Field, British Columbia where he worked in Yoho National Park, Prince George, Telkwa, Houston, and Smithers. He eventually settled in Hazelton where he worked with the Gitxsan Nation and ran a non- profit organization, the Storytellers Foundation, which focused on community- level economic development. He spent ten years as a municipal councilors, having been elected or acclaimed in the 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2009 local government elections. Background With his father working in the Royal Canadian Air Force, Doug Donaldson was born in 1957 at the Canadian Forces' Zweibr√ºcken Air Base in Germany. Donaldson completed a bachelor's degree in Biology and moved to Field, British Columbia where he worked in Yoho National Park for 8 years before leading private guided tours of the area. After completing a Masters in Journalism he had numerous articles published in the Calgary Herald and The Vancouver Sun but moved to Smithers where he wrote for a local newspaper, The Interior News. He took a job in Prince George with the CBC Morning Show but moved back to the Bulkley Valley area, living in Telkwa as a technologist in the forestry industry before moving to Houston working as a manager at Northwest Community College (later renamed \\"Coast Mountain College\\"). Finally, Donaldson settled in the village of Hazelton where he became the communications officer for the Gitxsan Treaty Office. In 1992, he starting teaching journalism at the Gitxsan Wet'suwet'en Education Society located in the same village. In 1994, he co-founded the non-profit group Storytellers Foundation which focuses on civic literacy and economic development on the community-level. He got involved in municipal politics in 1999 when he became a member of the municipal council of the village of Hazelton. He retained his seat in the 2002 local government elections, and won re-election in November 2005. For the May 2005 provincial election, Donaldson put his name forward to represent the BC New Democratic Party in the Bulkley Valley-Stikine constituency. In the nomination race he defeated three other candidates, including the former MLA Bill Goodacre. This riding was expected to be competitive as it had traditionally supported the NDP but was being held by BC Liberal Party member Dennis MacKay. Donaldson was supported party leader Carole James who visited the riding during the campaign but had to defend party campaign promises that appeared to mean removing provincial funding for major upgrades to a Smithers ice arena and a Houston swimming pool. Also, during the election campaign, Elections BC identified third-party advertising violations at Donaldson's campaign office where they were distributing B.C. Government Employees Union-sponsored lawn signs; Elections BC told the campaign office to cease the distribution and account for the signs as part of their own campaign expenditures. Mackay, a retired provincial coroner, won re- election by defeating Donaldson. Donaldson would again be the NDP nominee for the 2009 provincial election, but in the years between the election he continued to being active on the Hazelton council. He led the council and the Union of B.C. Municipalities to adopt a resolution asking the province to place a moratorium on new fish farm licences until the report by the provincial Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture was made public. Donaldson also supported efforts which called for a suspension of the Klappan Coalbed Methane Project in the Sacred Headwaters. Provincial politics For the May 2009 provincial election Donaldson won the NDP nomination in March and campaigned throughout April and May. Party leader Carole James visited the riding to support Donaldson. The incumbent, Dennis MacKay, had retired but Donaldson faced two new opponents: vehicle service manager Scott Groves for the BC Liberals and Smithers HVAC engineer Roger Benham for the BC Green Party. While Donaldson won the riding, the BC Liberals were re-elected to form another majority government. The BC NDP formed the official opposition and Bruce Ralston was named Finance critic with Donaldson as his deputy. =39th Parliament= During the 39th Parliament he was appointed to the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services where he served as deputy chair. As part of this committee he traveled the province for public consultation on budget matters. In the first session (2009), Donaldson and the NDP supported 75% of the recommendations, dissenting on the others that related to the introduction of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). Donaldson was opposed to the replacement of the Provincial Sales Tax with the HST, claiming that the BC Liberals were \\"wildly inflating its benefits\\". During the second session (2010), Donaldson again traveled the province with the committee but led the NDP in withdrawing their participation after Premier Gordon Campbell announced, two weeks before the committee's report was due, that he had already allocated all the province's discretionary funding. A petition asking to the HST to be repealed was circulated within his riding; the FightHST organization claimed 3,648 people (30% of voters) signed in the Stikine riding and in the Summer 2011 referendum on the issue 3,300 people in the riding voted to repeal the HST. Donaldson opened two constituency offices, one in Hazelton and the other in Smithers. On local issues, Donaldson, along with his federal counterpart Nathan Cullen, tried to stop Nav Canada from replacing flight observers with electronic monitoring devices at the Smithers Airport. Donaldson initiated a writing contest supported by hockey player Dan Hamhuis, the Gitxsan Nation, and the Community Police, where youths described how sports activities helped them resist gang activity and contributed to their community. Donaldson became an advocate of strong environmental assessment reviews as a means of creating investor certainty in projects. His opposition to the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines angered Premier Campbell. Donaldson was critical of the provincial government's negotiation skills with federal government on RCMP contracts and funding relating to changes in crime legislationDonaldson: Province needs better negotiation skills. The Interior News [Smithers, B.C] 18 Apr 2012: 1. and with First Nations engagement on mining proposals. Donaldson was a supporter of BC NDP leader Carole James, but after her resignation, he supported Mike Farnworth during the leadership election, citing Farnworth's view of rural economic development which includes using a triple bottom line that involves social, environmental and economic criteria. Due to the leadership election, Donaldson also became the NDP critic on Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, in addition to being the deputy critic on Finance. Adrian Dix eventually won the leadership and kept Ralston and Donaldson as the critic and deputy critic on Finance but moved Donaldson to deputy critic on Energy and Mines. A year later, in July 2012, Dix split the Energy and Mines critic role and appointed Donaldson to be critic of Mines, while removing him from the Finance portfolio. As critic of Mines, Donaldson questioned the government's approval of allowing 200 temporary foreign workers to fill positions in a Tumbler Ridge coal mine but was supportive of the government's refusal of a copper-gold-molybdenum mine, near Granisle, due to the adverse effects on fisheries. =40th Parliament= Entering the May 2013 general election, Donaldson was acclaimed as the NDP candidate in December 2012 with his primary opponent Sharon Hartwell, the former mayor of Telkwa, being announced as the BC Liberal candidate in April. Also in the election, Donaldson faced Roger Benham of the BC Green Party again, as well as the former leader of the Christian Heritage Party Rod Taylor, BC Conservative Jonathan Dieleman, and independent candidate Jesse O'Leary. The polls projected Donaldson and the NDP to win the election. While Donaldson did win re-election, the NDP again formed the Official Opposition to the BC Liberals who won an expanded majority. As the 40th Parliament began, Donaldson was reassigned to be the critic for aboriginal relations and reconciliation. In July 2014, new party leader John Horgan re-assigned Donaldson to be the critic for children and family development issues but upon the July 2016 announcement of Norm Macdonald not seeking re-election, Donaldson was again re-assigned to Macdonald position as critic for Energy and Mines. Donaldson sponsored one private member bill, the British Columbia Oil and Gas Activities Amendment Act, 2014 which proposed to prohibit the conversion of natural gas pipelines to transmit oil or diluted bitumen. While the bill did not advance beyond first reading, its proposal was implemented by the Minister of Natural Gas Development as a regulation. =41st Parliament= Donaldson sought re-election in the 2017 provincial election, where he was challenged by Gitanyow Band Councillor Wanda Good for the BC Liberals and, again, Rod Taylor of the Christian Heritage Party. While Donaldson again won the Stikine riding, his BC NDP formed the Official Opposition to a BC Liberal minority government as the 41st Parliament began. As neither opposition parties were willing to support the BC Liberal government, they lost a confidence vote and the BC NDP was offered the opportunity to form a minority government. NDP leader John Horgan became the Premier and appointed Donaldson to his Executive Council as Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. In this role, he led three bills through parliament. First, Bill 37 of the 3rd session, titled Land Statutes Amendment Act, 2018, was introduced on October 1 and adopted on October 31, 2018. It amended the Land Act, Land Title Act, Strata Property Act and Property Transfer Tax Act to allow for more e-signature and e-filings technologies, and amended the Boundary Act to allow certain adjustments of the border between BC and Alberta to be made without a referendum. Bill 21 of the 4th session, titled Forest and Range Practices Amendment Act, 2019 and adopted on May 16, 2019, amended the Forest and Range Practices Act to require forest companies publish Forest Operation Maps and update stewardship plans every 5 years or following a wildfire. Bill 14, the Heritage Conservation Amendment Act, 2019 and adopted on May 30, 2019, amended the Heritage Conservation Act to create a legal duty-to-report discoveries of specific sites or objects with potential heritage value and expanded the government's to amend and refuse permits and otherwise enforce the act. Finally, also adopted on May 30, Bill 22 amended the Forest Act to insert consideration of the \\"public interest\\" in decision to approve the disposition of Forest Act agreements and require ministerial approval of the transferring of a timber licences between companies.

Lord Holland was appointed captain of the English forces in Aquitaine in 1366, and in 1375, he was made a Knight of the Garter. Two years later in 1377, his half-brother Richard succeeded to the throne of England, as King Richard II.

Business model 1BOG has a solution for the pain point the solar industry has experienced up to now in the residential market‚Äîlarge upfront costs make many homeowners reluctant or unable to manage the purchase. One executive told Venturebeat that outside of a few very tiny neighborhoods in San Francisco, the company finds that about 80% of its customers need financing: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that difference between paying about $10,000 and just a thousand up front,‚Äù he said. Originally, 1BOG used community organizing techniques such as house parties, canvassing, and volunteer recruitment in addition to social networking and traditional marketing techniques to obtain a critical mass of consumers in a given city who are interested in learning more about solar technology.Rob Walker, ‚ÄúPanel Discussion,‚Äù The New York Times Magazine, April 3, 2009. When a homeowner first expressed an interest in solar, 1BOG would evaluate the roof to determine whether the option made sense for the homeowner. If solar was a good option for the particular house and the homeowner's electric bill was more than a certain amount, 1BOG would identified similar solar prospects in the area and group them together, leveraging that bargaining power with solar installers to establish a lower cost. As one customer said: :We wouldn't have done it otherwise...just that much additional money that I didn't quite have. Recently 1BOG has been a leading force in the move to solar leasing, a newer model which applies to solar technology a financing structure similar to an automobile lease. As many as 40% of solar customers now lease rather than purchase their solar equipment outright. Campaigns 1BOG's Bay Area pilot campaign in 2008 organized 42 solar customers. Real Goods Solar won the bid for that project.1BOG Cities: Past Campaigns The second Bay Area campaign signed up over 1200 members. This time the chosen installer was SolarCity. \\"What really sealed it for us was their offer of free demand-side energy monitoring and a free home-energy audit to 1BOG participants,\\" according to 1BOG general manager Dave Llorens. \\"The audit shows people where to find the best bang-for-the-buck on green home improvements, while the new monitoring technology empowers people to make continued and measurable improvements to their energy efficiency.\\" In addition to the Bay Area, 1BOG currently has campaigns at various stages in Los Angeles, San Diego, New Orleans, Denver, Phoenix, Sacramento, Washington, Aspen, Austin, Bergen County (New Jersey), Boston, Brooklyn, Las Vegas, Miami, Portland and Seattle. 1BOG is currently working with a variety of solar providers, and plans to branch out into solar thermal installations and home energy conservation. 1BOG Logo ‚Äì a.k.a. \\"Plugfoot\\" The 1BOG logo, often referred to as ‚Äúthe Bogman‚Äù, is the result of a crowdsourcing branding effort led by Sylvia Ventura in April 2008. The logo challenge resulted in over 150 submissions. The Bogman was the finalist. Key people 1BOG was founded in 2008 by Dave Llorens (CEO), Sylvia Ventura, and Dan Barahona. In 2012, 1BOG was acquired by Pure Energies Group. History In early 2007, Ventura and Barahona spent three months researching solar power for their San Francisco home. They became expert in solar technologies, electric utility rates and metering, and local and federal tax incentives and rebates and found that many people were interested in residential solar technology, but few knew anything about it, nor where it was feasible. So Ventura and Barahona created advocacy and outreach website Solar4SF.org in an effort to share their research and promote solar with for easy-to-understand information and evaluation criteria for Bay Area residents. In March 2008 Barahona and Ventura imagined an entire city block in which every residence would go solar. The collective buying power of this relatively larger group of solar consumers would allow them to negotiate better pricing from installers. The goal of taking one city block off the grid led to their new venture's name, One Block Off the Grid, soon shortened to the acronym 1BOG. The difficulty of convincing every single homeowner in a city block to commit to a major purchase however made Ventura and Barahona focus on aggregates of a ‚Äòvirtual city block‚Äô representing about 200 kilowatts. They met Llorens, a solar consultant and the co-founder of SolarPowerRocks.com,Here's how you get the most from solarpowerrocks.com:  Solar Power Rocks a site that provides solar information for all fifty states. The three agreed to build 1BOG together. 1BOG officially launched on June 5, 2008, the day after San Francisco enacted the largest solar incentive in the city's history. It was followed by numerous grassroot and social media efforts to educate and recruit San Francisco residents. Within one month 200 people had signed up on 1BOG's website to receive an evaluation. The San Francisco pilot helped convert 42 homes to solar energy by negotiating a 48% reduction from list price, and generated over $800,000 in local solar installation sales. The San Francisco Chronicle\\"Shining a light on S.F. solar options,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, October 11, 2008 documented the success of the campaign in an in-depth article on October 11, 2008. The press coverage drove another 400 new 1BOG members within two days and helped propel 1BOG forward on future campaigns. Over the following months 1BOG was featured prominently in Huffington Post, CNET, New York Times, TIME, Wall Street Journal, Wired, TreeHugger, and others. By the end of October 1BOG had seeded campaigns in seven additional cities including New York, Seattle, Portland, Colorado, and San Jose and Oakland in the Bay Area. The company was acquired in November 2008 by San Francisco-based Virgance, a company that promotes large-scale social activism through market-based methods. In 2009 1BOG formed an alliance with SunRun to offer financing options aimed at lowering the upfront costs traditionally associated with solar installations. It was acquired in 2010 by Virgance, a for-profit Web 2.0 company with plans to use social media to make activism interesting and fun. It remained however more active and widely known than its parent company. It was bought in 2012 by Pure Energies Group, a closely held Toronto-based solar panel manufacturer that credited its ability to make the purchase to Ontario's 2009 Green Energy Act. Pure Energies vice president Chris Stern would not give a price for the acquisition but said he expected the new enterprise to be making $50 million by the end of 2012.

A member of the BC New Democratic Party, she was first elected to represent the riding of Burnaby-Deer Lake. In the 39th Parliament, with her party forming the official opposition, Corrigan acted as the critic for the 2010 Winter Olympics and women's issues, and following the 2011 BC NDP leadership election the critic for Public Safety, Solicitor General and women's issues. She served on the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts in all four sessions and the Select Standing Committee on Crown Corporations in the final two sessions. She currently serves as the Official Opposition Spokesperson for Advanced Education. Background She was born in Toronto, Ontario, to a mother who worked as a physics teacher and a father who worked as an engineer. The family, which included Kathy and three siblings, moved to Cornwall, Ontario when she was three years old and then to West Vancouver in 1961. She graduated from Sentinel Secondary School when she was 16 years old and went on to study at the University of British Columbia. At the age of 21, she entered UBC Law. It was there, at a social event for law students in March 1976 that she met Derek Corrigan. They spent time together and were married in December. She graduated in 1978 and practiced law before having her first child in 1980, at the age of 26. She decided to focus on raising a family, so she became a full-time mother and had three more children in the next six years. After her children entered high school, Corrigan took a job as a policy researcher for the Canadian Union of Public Employees and the Hospital Employees' Union. After several unsuccessful attempts, her husband Derek was elected to the Burnaby City Council in 1987 and would serve as a city councillor until 2002 when he was elected mayor. Derek's enjoyment of being a councillor motivated Kathy to seek a public position, so she stood in Burnaby's (School District 41) 1999 school board election. She won a seat on the seven member board, coming in third in total votes. She was re-elected in the 2002 and 2005 elections, coming in first and second in total votes, respectively. She was elected, each year, by the board to be the vice-chair from 2003 to 2006, and then to be the chair of the board in 2007 and 2008. On school board issues, she resisted regionalization of school districts and public-private partnerships in service delivery. She had a dispute with Burnaby MLA Patty Sahota over what Corrigan believed was political interference and with a fellow board member who attributed good performance at school to specific ethnicities. Provincial politics Prior to becoming an MLA, Corrigan worked as a policy researcher for the Canadian Union of Public Employees and the Hospital Employees' Union and as a lawyer previously. She graduated from the University of British Columbia Law School in 1978 and married fellow law student Derek Corrigan. After having their first child, Kathy decided to leave the law profession and become a homemaker. Derek went on to be elected to the Burnaby City Council in 1987 and become mayor in 2002, while Kathy was elected to the Burnaby School Board for three terms, between 1999 and 2008, where she also served as chair for two years. In April 2008 she announced she would not be seeking reelection to the school board and several days later announced she would her intention to be a candidate for the BC New Democratic Party in the next provincial election. The Burnaby-Deer Lake riding was created in a boundary re-alignment with BC Liberal John Nuraney as its incumbent MLA. Corrigan was acclaimed the NDP candidate in October 2008. The riding was thought to be competitive for both the BC Liberals and NDP, as the boundary re-alignment and the incumbent MLA was believed to favour the BC Liberals favour, while Corrigan was considered a star candidate with name recognition from her time on the school board and with her husband winning re-election as mayor in November 2008. The salient issue of the election was the site selection of a proposed remand (prison) centre. The site, located in the Burnaby-Deer Lake riding, was opposed by both Kathy and Derek Corrigan. The NDP hosted a public event to oppose locating the remand centre at the selected site and Burnaby City Council issued a resolution stating their opposition. While the incumbent MLA Nuraney defended it, BC Solicitor-General John van Dongen announced the site selection would be re-considered with the advice of Metro Vancouver. In the general election, in May 2009, Corrigan defeated BC Liberals candidate Nuraney and BC Green Party candidate and retired business consultant Bruce Friesen, though the BC Liberals won a renewed majority government, with the NDP as the official opposition. As the 39th Parliament began, she was appointed to the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts in all four sessions. NDP leader Carole James assigned Corrigan to be the critic for the 2010 Winter Olympics and ActNow BC, opposite Mary McNeil who was Minister of State for the Olympics and ActNow BC. Corrigan would later add critic for women's issues to her duties. On Olympic issues, she criticized the provincial government for planning to spend $30 million in bonuses for VANOC employees, though only half that was delivered due to a budget shortfall, and $1 million for tickets for MLAs and their guests while at the same time asking for lowering spending budget due to the 2008 recession. When the government claimed the Olympics had cost $925 million, which was $325 million over budget, Corrigan estimated that the actual cost was closer to $1.2 billion if indirect expenses, such as upgrades BC Place Stadium and the SkyTrain system, and the expenses associated with the 650 public service employees that were reassigned to the games, were factored in, and that VANOC should not have reported a balanced its budget with government transfers and crown sponsorships claimed as revenue. She also asked for provincial and federal government advocacy directed at VANOC and the IOC over their decision not to include females in the ski jumping event. Along with neighbouring NDP MLA Raj Chouhan, she co-wrote letters to editors participated in public events targeted at opposing the Harmonized Sales Tax. In Fall 2010, as an NDP caucus revolt unfolded, Corrigan remained loyal to party leader Carole James. When Norm Macdonald resigned as caucus chair in protest of James' leadership, James assigned Corrigan to that position. After attempts at reconciliation within the caucus failed and James resigned as leader, Corrigan called the loss upsetting and sad. Interim leader Dawn Black reassigned Corrigan to be their critic on Public Safety and Solicitor General. While both Kathy and Derek Corrigan were cited as being viable candidates in the subsequent BC NDP leadership election, both declined and, in January 2011, endorsed John Horgan. After Adrian Dix won the leadership election, he kept Corrigan in her role as critic on women's issues and on Public Safety and Solicitor General. She linked an $8 million cut to the court system in 2011, with the $6 million payment for legal fees to defend Dave Basi and Bob Virk in the BC Rail corruption case. She advocated that the province should cover the full costs of the 2011 Stanley Cup riot review, rather than cost-sharing with the Metro Vancouver municipalities and sought to have the Legislative Assembly join Ontario and Quebec in lobbying the federal government for funds to implement the proposed Safe Streets and Communities Act. Corrigan challenged the Minister of Social Development, and Burnaby-Lougheed MLA, Harry Bloy over cuts to Community Living BC after a Burnaby family, with a son living with autism and Down syndrome, who had their support withdrawn sought help from Corrigan's office. She also had a dispute with Christy Clark who had referred to a female NDP MLA as part of the NDP's \\"women's auxiliary\\", in reference to Clark's belief that the party did not allow women to speak on substantive issues in the Legislative Assembly, but which Corrigan found to be disrespectful towards the women in the NDP caucus.

Bahrain has an embassy in London and the United Kingdom is one of only four European countries to maintain an embassy in Manama. Bahrain gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1971 and has since maintained strong diplomatic, military and trade relations. HistoryEarly treaties= At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Britain, then the dominant power in the region, was attempting to end piracy in the Persian Gulf to secure maritime trading routes to its East India Company in the Indies. In 1805, the ruling House of Khalifa offered to support Britain against Persians in exchange for occasional help by British gunships. Their request was backed by the British Resident in Muscat, but the Government of India rejected it. In 1816, the British Political Resident, William Bruce signed an unofficial agreement with Al Khalifa in which Britain was to remain neutral in the war between Oman and Bahrain. Four years later, Bruce refused to guarantee a truce agreement between Bahrain and Oman. In 1820, Britain signed the General Maritime Treaty with tribal chiefs of the Persian Gulf, including Al Khalifa (at their request). By signing this treaty, Britain recognised Al Khalifa as \\"legitimate\\" rulers of Bahrain. In 1822, Britain peacefully prevented an imminent war between Bahrain and Oman. Between 1820 and 1850, Al Khalifa repeatedly tried to persuade British authorities to provide full protection to Bahrain against external threats, but without avail. Britain wanted Bahrain to remain an independent state. The situation changed in 1859‚Äì60, when the Khalifa ruler appealed to the Persians and Ottomans to provide protection, and in 1861 blockaded Al-Hasa, a coastal oasis in Eastern Arabia. This prompted the British in 1861 to force the ruler to sign a Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship; under its terms the ruler of Bahrain was not to engage in \\"prosecution of war, piracy and slavery at sea\\" and Britain was to provide maritime protection. The treaty also recognised the Khalifa ruler as an \\"independent ruler\\". Six years later, in 1867‚Äì8, the British navy intervened after a Bahraini attack on Qatar. After two years, in 1869, they intervened again to end an internal struggle over power, and appointed Shaikh Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa, then aged 21 as ruler of Bahrain. In subsequent years, the British exercised increasing control over Shaikh Isa's communications with foreign powers, especially the Ottomans, which had claims over Bahrain and Qatar. Between 1878 and 1880, the British failed to protect Bahrain against pirates operating from lands claimed by the Ottomans. They also prevented Shaikh Isa from defending Zubarah, a center of trade and pearl fishing sited midway between the Strait of Hormuz and the west arm of the Gulf, against a land attack, in order to avoid a confrontation with the Ottomans, who supported the Al-Abdulla (a branch of Al Khalifa which had been banished from Bahrain after a feud over power). The increasing Ottoman influence in the region threatened the status quo in Bahrain and prompted Colonel E.C. Ross, the British Resident, to sign a new treaty with Bahrain on 22 December 1880. The treaty prohibited the ruler of Bahrain from negotiating, signing treaties or accepting any form of diplomatic representation with foreign powers without British consent, with the exception of \\"customary friendly correspondence .. of minor importance\\". It did not refer to Bahrain's independence. Fearing the increasing Ottoman activity and French influence in the region, Britain signed a new treaty with Bahrain in 1892 which further limited the foreign relations of the ruler by prohibiting disposal of territory to any foreign power other than Britain. It also prohibited the minor communications exempted by the 1880 treaty. The treaties of 1880 and 1892 effectively turned Bahrain into a British protectorate, giving the British control over defence and foreign relations. The ruler was also to accept British \\"advice\\" regarding internal matters. During this period, Bahrain was the center of British commercial operations in the region. Between 1829 and 1904, the Persian Gulf Residency appointed an Assistant post in Bahrain. It was occupied by natives until 1900 when a Britisher was assigned to the post to accommodate the increase in British trade and attract British companies. The British were mainly concerned with their commercial interests and paid little attention to Bahraini internal affairs. Britain is credited by historians for the stability and growth Bahrain experienced in the latter half of the 19th century. =Increasing British protection= In 1903, Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, visited Bahrain and highlighted the need to reform the customs ‚Äì which were in a state of chaos ‚Äì by appointing a British director. When Shaikh Isa resisted what he considered an interference, Curzon told him the British were persisting in their demands. Complaints about the customs had been made as early as 1885 and remained a popular topic for British officials until the implementation of the administrative reforms in the 1920s. Throughout this period, Shaikh Isa resisted British control over customs, in order to remain financially independent. In 1904, the post of British Assistant was elevated to British Political Agent. On 29 September, followers of Ali ibn Ahmed Al Khalifa, a nephew of Shaikh Isa, attacked clerks working for a German trading firm. Ali himself attacked the German trader. On 14 November, his followers attacked and severely injured several Persians. The Political Agent asked Shaikh Isa to punish the aggressors and compensate the victims, but Shaikh Isa refused. After failing to get justice in Bahrain, the victimised parties referred their cases to the German consul in the Persian port city of Bushehr and the Persian Secretary for Foreign Affairs respectively. Fearing that these incidents would allow foreign powers to \\"gain an opening for assailing [the British] regime\\", Major Percy Cox, the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf visited Bahrain in a navy fleet on 30 November. Shaikh Isa agreed to punish those behind the attack on the German firm, but not those who attacked the Persians. After consultations with higher British authorities, Cox returned to Bahrain in a great show of force on 23 February 1905. He issued an ultimatum ending on 25 February. Cox demanded deporting Ali, compensating the Persians, prohibiting forced labour of foreigners, and adhering to advisories from the British Political Agent. He threatened to fire on the capital city of Manama if Shaikh Isa did not comply. Shaikh Isa agreed to the demands on 26 February, after Cox had fired a few blank shots on the major port city of Manama. In secret, however, he allegedly forewarned Ali of his inevitable arrest. Finding that Ali was gone, Cox took the heir apparent, Shaikh Hamad, as hostage, imposed house arrest on Shaikh Isa and confiscated Ali's properties. He then arrested Jassim al-Mihza, the influential Sunni judge. Three days later, Cox was satisfied with the results as the population submitted to the British. Shaikh Hamad and al-Mihza were released and Shaikh Isa was freed from house arrest. Ali surrendered himself in July and was deported to British Bombay in September. In January 1906, Cox extended the jurisdiction of the British Political Agent to Persians when he ruled that a Persian who was caught stealing from a British ship harboured in Bahrain fell under British jurisdiction. In April, the British further extended their jurisdiction to include Jews and native Christians after the former group complained of harassment over taxes by Shaikh Isa. According to one British official, all these judicial powers were \\"not authorized by any law\\". The full implications of these actions were not realised at first. Because all \\"foreigners\\" were placed under the British jurisdiction, an often-conflicted dual authority was created, one led by the ruler, the other by the British Political Agency. During the time, there was an increasing number of foreigners due to the pearl boom which was coupled with stability. At the same time, the term \\"foreigner\\" lacked a precise definition; both Shaikh Isa and the British claimed non- Bahraini Arabs and native-born Baharnah as their subjects. Shaikh Isa's motivations were political as well as financial, as he charged 10% of all legal fees. Shaikh Isa's reaction to this change was to postpone any reform to the customs which he thought of as \\"the darlings of British trade\\". The British attempted to use this atmosphere to their advantage; Captain F.B. Prideaux, the newly appointed Political Agent, had been developing plans for administrative reforms. Unlike other British officials, he did not suggest changes in the customs or internal authority of Al Khalifa. Instead, Prideaux proposed that reforms be focused on \\"ending local tyranny\\" in the form of forced labour, and judicial and financial corruption. His proposals were the basis of the Bahrain Order in Council, a document issued in 1913 that secured the legal status of Britain in Bahrain. At first, these plans were rejected by Cox, who thought they were premature. British officials thought that by 1908 Shaikh Isa would be forced to accept reforms in the customs due to the expiration of Banyan merchants contracts. However, in January 1908, the customs revenue increased when Shaikh Isa appointed local officials. =Bahrain Order in Council and World War I= Before late 1907, the British had not openly declared Bahrain a formal protectorate; instead they considered it under their protection. The Foreign Office refused to use \\"strict terms\\" to define the status of Bahrain. But in private correspondents between British officials, the term \\"protectorate\\" was often used since 1890s. On 14 November 1907, the Government of India requested issuing an Order in Council for Bahrain in light of the growing British jurisdiction over foreigners. Rising foreign interests and trade in the region, especially those of Germans, was another important motivation. In the request, the Government of India acknowledged that the treaty of 1880 had turned Bahrain into \\"a sort of protectorate\\". In February 1908, the Foreign Office questioned whether administrative reforms could be carried out along with formally acknowledging the increased British jurisdiction over Bahrain, so that the latter might not provoke any hostile reactions from other foreign powers. In March, a committee headed by John Morley, the Secretary of State for India, was formed. It concluded in its final report that Bahrain was in fact a British \\"visual Protectorate\\" (but did not see fit to declare it so publicly) and that the Order in Council should be issued following written consent from Shaikh Isa over the new status of British jurisdiction over foreigners. The report was approved in February 1909 and in addition to its recommendations, the Government of India was tasked on May with preparing a draft for the Order in Council. Shaikh Isa's consent was secured in July, however for various reasons, the draft was only submitted in June 1911. Further negotiations with Shiakh Isa and the Ottomans delayed the approval of the Order in Council until 12 August 1913. The Bahrain Order in Council (BOIC) was published in The London Gazette on 15 August. It provided legal cover for British jurisdiction over foreigners. It also limited the powers of the ruler and gave the Political Agent far reaching jurisdiction, including over religious law courts. John Marlowe stated that this had equated Bahrain's status with a British colony and the British Political Resident's power with that of a Colonial Governor. Littlefield wrote that the BOIC had made Bahrain \\"in all but name, a British colony\\" and that it aroused anti-British feelings. Six law courts were to be formed: the Chief Court (Muslims), the District Court (foreigners), the Joint Court (Bahrainis vs foreigners), al-Majlis al-Urfi (only when disputing parties agreed to refer to it), Salifa Court (concerned with pearl-diving) and Kazi's Court, to which cases could be referred from other courts. The applicable law was to be the law of British India with some amendments. However, the BOIC was suspended due to negotiations with Ottomans and the outbreak of the First World War. It was only put into effect in February 1919, announcing the start of the administrative reforms. A few months before the war, Bahrain granted Britain exclusive oil concessions. During the war, most Bahrainis were not supportive of the Allies, though they were at war with the Ottomans. The British thought this was due to British lack of attention toward oppression of native Bahrainis and suspension of reforms. These anti-British feelings were another reason for delaying implementation of the Order in Council until after the war. On the other hand, Shaikh Isa and his family, especially his younger son, Shaikh Abdulla, were loyal to the British. Shaikh Isa was given the Companion (CIE) and Knight Commander (KCIE) of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1915 and 1919 respectively. Shaikh Abdulla too was given CIE in 1915. The situation within Bahrain was calm, but the economic times were very hard; the customs income decreased by 80%, 5,000 died due to plague in Manama and in the capital Muharraq, and many others emigrated. Many were brought to the \\"brink of famine\\" due to India's ban on exporting rice and the subsequent increase in the price of staple commodities. Shaikh Isa responded in 1917 by borrowing from merchants, increasing the customs tax and dispossessing the Shia Muslims, who were now the only non-Sunni group which did not enjoy British protection. At the time, Britain responded to external threats from the Wahhabis, Ottomans and Persians by tightening its grip over Bahrain. Ottomans and Persians had longstanding claims over the island. Following the end of the war, Persian media launched a campaign calling for a stop to the oppressive policies against their co-religious Shia. By the end of the war, the Persian Gulf became \\"a British lake\\", as all enemies of Britain were defeated and its control was therefore left unchallenged. This marked a shift in the British policy in Bahrain toward more intervention in the island's internal affairs. The main British naval base in the Persian Gulf region was moved to Bahrain in 1935 shortly after the start of large-scale oil production. In 1960, the United Kingdom put Bahrain's future to international arbitration and requested that the United Nations Secretary-General take on this responsibility. In 1970, Iran laid claim to Bahrain and the other Persian Gulf islands. The British Government then persuaded Iran to drop its claim to the island of Bahrain. However, in an agreement with the United Kingdom it agreed \\"not to pursue\\" its claims on Bahrain if its other claims were realised. In the same year, the United Nations reported that \\"the Bahrainis were virtually unanimous in wanting a fully independent sovereign state. The following plebiscite saw Bahrainis confirm their Arab identity and independence from Britain. Bahrain was to declare itself fully independent on 15 August 1971. The British withdrew from Bahrain on 16 December 1971, making Bahrain an independent emirate. In 2005, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair and King of Bahrain Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa released a joint statement saying that the two countries \\"have a strong, warm and longstanding relationship, rooted in our friendship over the years and in the 1971 Friendship Treaty\\". 7,000 Britons work in Bahrain making it the largest European community of expatriates. There are also more than 2,000 Bahraini students studying in Britain.  Trade  In 2012, bilateral trade between the countries was worth ¬£884 million.  Agreements  In 2006, Bahrain and the United Kingdom signed an agreement for the promotion of protection investments which was designed \\"to create favourable conditions for greater investment by nationals and companies of one State in the territory of the other State.\\" On 13 June 2007, a co-operation agreement was signed between Bahrain Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. On 11 October 2012, a defence co-operation agreement was signed between Bahrain and the United Kingdom to promote intelligence sharing, education, scientific and technical co-operation and joint training of military forces.

It is a roughly triangular island with a total land area of . Its coastline is deeply creased by Paterson Inlet (east), Port Pegasus (south), and Mason Bay (west). The island is generally hilly (rising to at Mount Anglem) and densely forested. Flightless birds, including penguins, thrive because there are few introduced predators. Stewart Island/Rakiura is sparsely populated and its economy is dependent on summer tourism and fishing. Its permanent population was recorded at 408 people as of the 2018 census, most of whom live in the settlement of Oban on the eastern side of the island. Ferries connect the settlement to Bluff in the South Island. Stewart Island/Rakiura is part of the Southland District for local government purposes.  History and naming  Paterson Inlet at sunset Mudflats near Oban The original MƒÅori name, Te Punga o Te Waka a MƒÅui, positions Stewart Island firmly at the heart of MƒÅori mythology. Translated as The Anchor Stone of MƒÅui‚Äôs Canoe, it refers to the part played by the island in the legend of MƒÅui and his crew, who from their canoe, the South Island, caught and raised the great fish, the North Island. Rakiura is the more commonly known and used MƒÅori name. It is usually translated as Glowing Skies, possibly a reference to the sunsets for which it is famous or for the aurora australis, the southern lights that are a phenomenon of southern latitudes. For some, Rakiura is the abbreviated version of Te Rakiura a Te Rakitamau, translated as \\"great blush of Rakitamau\\", in reference to the latter's embarrassment when refused the hand in marriage of not one but two daughters of an island chief. According to MƒÅori legend, a chief on the island named Te Rakitamau was married to a young woman who became terminally ill and implored him to marry her cousin after she died. Te Rakitamau paddled across Te Moana Tapokopoko a Tawhiki (Foveaux Strait) to the South Island where the cousin lived, only to discover she had recently married. He blushed with embarrassment; so the island was called Te Ura o Te Rakitamau. Margaret Cameron-Ash claims that James Cook established the insularity of Stewart Island during his first Pacific voyage in 1770 but decided to hide his discovery for reasons of military and colonial policy.; But see also G.A. Mawer, review of Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage, The Globe, No. 84, 2018, pp.59-61; Nigel Erskine, ‚ÄúJames Cook's False Trail: Hidden Discoveries, Altered Records‚Äù, Signals, No. 125, Dec 2018-Feb 2019 pp.72-73. Both these authors argue against Cameron-Ash's contention. However, Mawer argues that Cook was simply unsure whether it was an island because his focus was on finding the southern extent of New Zealand, and conditions were unfavourable for more closely exploring a possible strait. The strait was first charted by Owen Folger Smith, a New Yorker who had been in Sydney Harbour with Eber Bunker, from whom he probably learned of the eastern seal fishery. Smith charted the strait in the whaleboat of the sealing brig Union (out of New York) in 1804 and on his 1806 chart, it was called Smith's Straits.Howard, Basil, and Stewart Island Centennial Committee.

The island received its English name in honour of William W. Stewart. He was first officer on the Pegasus, which visited in 1809, and he charted the large south-eastern harbour that now bears the ship's name (Port Pegasus) and determined the northern points of the island, proving that it was an island.John O'C. Ross, William Stewart, Sealing Captain, Trader and Speculator, Aranda (A.C.T), Roebuck Society, 1987, pp. 97-117. In 1824, he initiated plans in England to establish a timber, flax and trading settlement at Stewart Island and sailed there in 1826, with it becoming known as Stewart's Island. In 1841, the island was established as one of the three Provinces of New Zealand and was named New Leinster. However, the province existed on paper only and was abolished after only five years. With the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846, the province became part of New Munster, which entirely included the South Island. When New Munster was abolished in 1853, Stewart Island became part of Otago Province until 1861, when Southland Province split from Otago. In 1876, the provinces were abolished altogether. For most of the twentieth century, \\"Stewart Island\\" was the official name, and that is still in common use by most New Zealanders. The name was officially altered to Stewart Island/Rakiura by the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, one of many such changes under the NgƒÅi Tahu treaty settlement.Schedule 96 Alteration of place names  Geography  Satellite image of Stewart Island Northern part of Stewart Island, with a view over some of the bays Stewart Island has an area of . Its terrain is hilly and, like most of New Zealand, Stewart Island has an Oceanic climate. The north is dominated by the swampy valley of the Freshwater River. The river rises close to the northwestern coast and flows southeastwards into the large indentation of Paterson Inlet. The highest peak is Mount Anglem (), close to the northern coast. It is one of a rim of ridges that surround Freshwater Valley. The southern half is more uniformly undulating, rising to a ridge that runs south from the valley of the Rakeahua River, which also flows into Paterson Inlet. The southernmost point in this ridge is Mount Allen, at . In the southeast the land is somewhat lower, and is drained by the valleys of the Toitoi River, Lords River, and Heron River. South West Cape on this island is the southernmost point of the main islands of New Zealand. Mason Bay, on the west side, is notable as a long sandy beach on an island where beaches are typically far more rugged. One suggestion is that the bay was formed in the aftershock of a meteorite impact in the Tasman Sea; however, no evidence has been found to support such a claim. Three large and many small islands lie around the coast. Notable among these are Ruapuke Island, in Foveaux Strait northeast of Oban; Codfish Island, close to the northwest shore; and Big South Cape Island, off the southwestern tip. The Titi/Muttonbird Islands group is between Stewart Island and Ruapuke Island, around Big South Cape Island, and off the southeastern coast. Other islands of interest include Bench Island, Native Island, and Ulva Island, all close to the mouth of Paterson Inlet, and Pearl Island, Anchorage Island, and Noble Island, close to Port Pegasus in the southwest. Further offshore The Snares are oceanic islands, a volcano and some smaller islets, that were never connected to the larger Stewart Island. Stewart Island has a temperate climate. However, one travel guide mentions \\"frequent downpours that make 'boots and waterproof clothing mandatory\\", and another guide says that rainfall in Oban, the principal settlement, is a year. Owing to an anomaly in the magnetic latitude contours, this location is well placed for observing Aurora australis.  Settlements  Overlooking Oban and Halfmoon Bay on Stewart Island The only town is Oban, on Halfmoon Bay. A previous settlement, Port Pegasus, once boasted several stores and a post office, and was located on the southern coast of the island. It is now uninhabited, and is accessible only by boat or by an arduous hike through the island. Another site of former settlement is at Port William, a four-hour walk around the north coast from Oban, where immigrants from the Shetland Islands settled in the early 1870s. This was unsuccessful, and the settlers left within one to two years, most for sawmilling villages elsewhere on the island. Since 1988 the electricity supply on Stewart Island has come from diesel generators; previously residents used their own private generators. As a consequence electric power is around three times more expensive than in the South Island, at NZ$0.59/kWh in 2016. After photovoltaic and wind generation were tested on the island, the government providential growth fund put $3.16 million dollars towards building wind turbines on Stewart Island  Economy and communications  Fishing has been, historically, the most important element of the economy of Stewart Island, and while it remains important, tourism has become the main source of income for islanders. There has also been some farming and forestry. Oban has mainly sealed main roads, and some gravel roads on the outskirts. Stewart Island Flights links Ryan's Creek Aerodrome and Invercargill Airport and aircraft also land on the sand at Mason Bay, Doughboy Bay, and West Ruggedy Beach. A regular passenger ferry service runs between Bluff and Oban. The only ferry/barge link to the South Island for vehicles is to Bluff. Oban has phone and broadband (ADSL) services. Cellphone coverage is provided by Spark and Vodafone. All these services rely on a radio link to Bluff, so broadband speeds are limited. Stewart Island is able to receive most AM and FM radio stations broadcast in the Southland region. Television services are available via satellite using Sky or Freeview. Analogue terrestrial television services could be received on Stewart Island from the Hedgehope television transmitter located in the South Island prior to the analogue switch off on April 28, 2013.  Government  Oban, Halfmoon Bay, New Zealand 1977 From 1841 to 1853, Stewart Island was governed as New Leinster Province, then as part of New Munster Province. From 1853 onwards, it was part of the Otago Province. In local government today, Stewart Island is part of the Southland District and the Southland Region. However, it shares with some other islands a certain relaxation in some of the rules governing commercial activities. For example, every transport service operated solely on Great Barrier Island, the Chatham Islands, or Stewart Island is exempt from the Transport Act of 1962.  Ecology  Flora = Although the clay soil is not very fertile, the high rainfall and warm weather mean that the island is densely forested throughout. Native plants include the world's southernmost dense forest of podocarps (southern conifers) and hardwoods such as rƒÅtƒÅ and kƒÅmahi in the lowland areas with mƒÅnuka shrubland at higher elevations. The trees are thought to have become established here since the last ice age from seeds brought across the strait by seabirds, which would explain why the beech trees that are so common in New Zealand, but whose seeds are dispersed by the wind rather than birds, are not found on Stewart Island. Noeline Baker purchased land near Halfmoon Bay in the early 1930s and with a checklist by botanist Leonard Cockayne populated it with all the local indigenous plants. She gave the land and her house to the government in 1940, and today Moturau Moana is New Zealand's southernmost public garden. = Fauna = There are many species of birds on Stewart Island that have been able to continue to thrive because of the relative absence of the cats, rats, stoats, ferrets, weasels and other predators that humans brought to the main islands. There are even more species of birds, including huge colonies of sooty shearwater and other seabirds, on The Snares and the other smaller islands offshore. The birds of Stewart Island include weka, kƒÅkƒÅ, albatross, the flightless Stewart Island kiwi, silvereyes, fantails, and kerer≈´. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin has a significant number of breeding sites here C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Yellow-eyed Penguin: Megadypes antipodes, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg while the large colonies of sooty shearwaters on the offshore Muttonbird Islands, are subject to muttonbirding, a sustainable harvesting program managed by Rakiura MƒÅori. Meanwhile, a small population of the kakapo, a flightless parrot which is very close to extinction, was found on Stewart Island in 1977 and the birds subsequently moved to smaller islands (Codfish Island) for protection from feral cats. The South Island saddleback is similarly preserved. = Threats and preservation = As the island has always been sparsely populated and there has never been very much logging, much of the original wildlife is intact, including species that have been devastated on the larger islands to the north since their habitation by humans. However, although habitats and wildlife were not threatened by invasive species historically, now there are populations of cats, rats and brushtail possums on the island, as well as a large population of white-tailed deer, which are hunted for meat and sport, introduced to coastal areas. There is also a small population of red deer confined to the inland areas. Almost all the island is owned by the New Zealand government and over 80 per cent of the island is set aside as the Rakiura National Park, New Zealand's newest national park. Many of the small offshore islands, including the Snares, are also protected.  Claims of independence  Residents of Stewart Island have held a number of mock promotional fundraising events regarding a declaration of independence for the island, and to have it renamed to its original name of \\"Rakiura\\". In the late 1950s or early 1960s, they had a local printer overprint ‚ÄúINDEPENDENT RAKIURA‚Äù on eight values of some earlier New Zealand postage and health stamps. Eight different values, from one penny to ¬£1, were overprinted on the stamps, and their original values were blotted out with small black circles. The stamps were sold to collectors, with the proceeds helping to refurbish the Rakiura Museum. An effort to raise NZ$6,000 for a new swimming pool at the island's school involved selling 50-cent passports for the newly \\"independent\\" island. On 31 July 1970, a mock ceremony featured a declaration of independence, and the new republic's flag was unveiled. These efforts were not serious attempts for independence, and Stewart Island remains a part of the New Zealand state.Stewart Island (New Zealand)  References  External links  * Stewart Island News * Stewart Island Promotion Association Category:Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests Category:Ecoregions of New Zealand Category:Islands of Southland, New Zealand Category:Foveaux Strait ","title":"Stewart Island"},{"id":"22785335","text":"Michelle Obama and chef Sam Kass plant the garden with the help of Bancroft Elementary School fifth graders in 2009. The White House has multiple vegetable gardens since its completion in 1800. Eleanor Roosevelt, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama all have had their own versions of vegetable gardens. Roosevelt planted the White House victory garden during World War II to promote the use of victory gardens by American citizens in a time of possible food scarcity. Hillary Clinton had a vegetable garden constructed on the roof of the White House. On March 20, 2009 Michelle Obama broke ground on the largest and most expansive vegetable garden to date on the White House lawn. The current garden is funded by a $2.5-million donation provided in 2016 by Burpee Seeds and The Burpee Foundation. History of White House gardens The first White House garden was planted in 1800, by the second president of the United States John Adams and first lady Abigail Adams. Adams and his wife grew their own fresh fruits and vegetables to feed their family, rather than buying produce at the local market. After President Adams planted the first garden, former presidents that lived in the White House cultivated gardens of their own. In 1801, Thomas Jefferson, the second president who resided in the White House, transformed Adams‚Äô garden with the addition of ornamental and fruit trees. Since the grounds of the garden were too raw and muddy for serious planting in the first decade of the 19th century, President Jefferson arranged the construction of his own vegetable garden above Charlottesville so that it would be ready for his retirement. This inspired many American families to plant gardens in their yards. Jefferson also picked the location of the flower garden that was planted. In 1825, Adams was the first president to plant ornamental trees on the White House lawns. He personally planted seedlings such as fruit trees, herbs and vegetables to support his household. Adams also helped develop the flower gardens that Jefferson had originally planted. In 1835 President Andrew Jackson built a hothouse made out of glass, known as the orangery, that grew tropical fruit. The orangery produced fruit from 1836 until it was demolished and replaced by a full-scale greenhouse in 1857. Then several years later the greenhouse was broken down later in 1902 and replaced by the West Wing. =In time of war= The onset of World War I brought the start of food rationing to the White House. In 1918, President Woodrow Wilson and First Lady Edith Wilson brought sheep to graze and fertilize the lawns. This was a way to save manpower, fuel, and money required to take care of the lawns, because all resources were needed to fight overseas. During World War II in 1943 President Franklin Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt planted a victory garden on the White House grounds. The victory garden movement started because of food shortages caused by the war. Millions of victory gardens were planted across America during that period of time, producing about 40 percent of America's vegetables. =Resistance of vegetable gardens= Past efforts of growing vegetable gardens were not always followed through. Jimmy Carter, who was a Georgia farmer and a gardener, talked about how gardening was an important aspect of America's future in his campaign, but declined calls in 1978 to plant a vegetable garden at the White House. Another unsuccessful attempt was made by President Bill Clinton, who was denied by the White House, saying it was not in keeping with the formal nature of the White House grounds. The Clintons later resorted to planting a small vegetable garden on the roof of the building, where produce was grown and used for cooking. Obama‚Äôs vegetable garden A small lavender shrub planted next to a large salvia bush in the White House vegetable garden The Obamas planted a vegetable garden on the South Lawn of the White House on March 20, 2009. This L-shaped garden is by the mansion's tennis courts and can be seen from E street. The plot provides more than 55 varieties of vegetables along with fruits that were incorporated into meals made for the Obama family and invited guests. Another portion of the yields are donated to the local soup kitchen and the Food Bank Organization. The vegetables grown include: arugula (rocket), cilantro (coriander), tomatillo, hot peppers, spinach, chard, collards, black kale, berries and lettuce. In addition to the seeds selected to be planted are 25 heirloom seeds and 10 herbs such as anise hyssop and Thai basil. Former presidents' favorite produce plants were also sown, such as President Thomas Jefferson's preferred vegetables, ‚ÄúBrown Dutch and Tennis Ball lettuce, Prickly Seed spinach and Savoy cabbage‚Äù but beets were not grown because President Obama did not like them. Along with the vegetable garden, near the chef's kitchen a beehive was added that is overseen by Charlie Brandts, a beekeeper and White House carpenter. Honey collected from the beehives has been used to brew White House Honey Ale.Crugnale, James. Obama Homebrews White House Honey Ale For Medal Of Honor Recipient. Mediaite. September 16, 2011. Retrieved September 18, 2011. The contributing gardeners responsible for the early stages of the garden included the First Lady herself, White House Horticulturist Dale Haney, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, a team of chefs, and fifth graders from Bancroft Elementary School in Washington. These 23 fifth grader advocates, who had also grown a garden at their school, helped with digging up the soil, planting, harvesting, and cooking the crops produced. Project facilitator Michelle Obama made the vegetable garden a priority by requiring hands-on assistance from all the family members. In May 2012, the First Lady published American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America, a book detailing her experiences with the Kitchen Garden and promoting healthy eating. =Purpose= Mrs. Obama, who had no prior experience in gardening, was motivated to start a garden when she realized that her daughters Malia and Sasha were not receiving daily nutritious meals. The young girls' diet would sometimes consist of dining out three times a week with occasional sandwiches for dinner; the family's pediatrician recommended change. Mrs. Obama found growing a garden would be an easy way to get more fruits and vegetables in her daughters' diets. The emphasis on the vegetable garden movement was to encourage Americans to increase healthy food choices. The First Lady believed that changes could be made by cooking more at home, eliminating unhealthy foods, and consuming more fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, the garden could take a leading role in educating children about the benefits of locally grown produce in an attempt to decrease the rising cases of obesity and diet-related health issues affecting the nation. Mrs. Obama was confident that by educating the children of this generation, \\"they will begin to educate their families and that will, in turn, begin to educate our communities.‚Äù =Environmental and economic benefits= Foodies and Environmentalist are elated with the produce garden growing at the White House. Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore's Dilemma and advocate of sustainable agriculture, believes the garden is not only practical and efficient \\"but just as important, it teaches important habits of mind ‚Äì helping people to reconnect with their food, eat more healthily on a budget and recognize that we're less dependent on the industrial food chain, and cheap fossil fuel, than we assume.\\" By growing a vegetable garden at the White house emissions set off through the transportation as well as the additional costs from the purchasing of food products will be reduced. The fertilizers used in the plot are made with ‚ÄúWhite House compost, crab meal from the Chesapeake Bay, lime and green sand. Ladybugs and praying mantises will help control harmful bugs.\\" The project has also proved to be cost efficient by the roughly two hundred dollars spent on the cost of seeds which will provide a continuous supply of fresh produce year round. =Political implications= The vegetable patch has become a symbolic representation that has encouraged change within current government policies. For example, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack lobbied Congress to review The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act in order to change current school lunches. Vilsack also tried to persuade the USDA to provide more funds to make more fruits and vegetables accessible to children. The vegetable garden's supporters believe the Obamas' role modeling of local sustainable gardening will have a positive effect. The White House's Executive Chef Walter Scheib is enthusiastic about the fresh ingredients and states, \\"There has always been a small garden at the White House, but this commitment by Mrs. Obama to a local and freshly grown product is a progressive move forward that will raise the profile and awareness of local and sustainable food both at the White House and nationally to an unprecedented level.‚Äù =Organic versus non- organic= Vegetable gardens were non-existent for a long time in the American lifestyle until World War I and World War II when the use and application of gardens was revamped in the shape of victory gardens. These victory gardens were cultivated in one's own backyard. The victory gardens soon faded to memory after the war but recently have made a comeback. The day Michelle Obama broke ground on the new White House vegetable garden, a letter arrived for her from MACA, Mid-America Croplife Association, urging the Obamas to consider the need for traditional agriculture in America. MACA went on to urge the use of effective pest management in their garden to increase crop yield so they could feed more people. This idea was further satirized on \\"The Daily Show\\" by Jon Stewart. Jeff Stier of the pro-industry American Council of Science and Health states that it is irresponsible to eat organic, locally grown food because not everyone can afford it.Jeff Stier interview on The Daily Show, May 14, 2009 Stier also says that if the Obamas want to be responsible they should use sustainable crop techniques and teach children to use resources wisely to get more produce from their land.

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly from the riding of Comox Valley in the 2009 provincial election. After serving nearly 2 years on the backbenches he was appointed Minister of Agriculture on March 14, 2011, in Premier Christy Clark's first cabinet. On September 5, 2012, he was appointed as the Minister of Education. In addition to his ministerial roles, he sat on the Environment and Land Use Committee and the Cabinet Committee on Open Government and Engagement. He introduced one piece of legislation, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act, 2011. Prior to working in the provincial government, McRae worked as a secondary school teacher at Georges P. Vanier Secondary School. He spent seven years on Courtenay's city council, having successfully run in the 2002, 2005, and 2008 municipal elections. He was appointed as a director to the Comox-Strathcona Regional District and later the Comox Valley Regional District. Background Don McRae was born and raised in the Comox Valley. He graduated from Georges P. Vanier Secondary School and went to the University of British Columbia where he graduated specializing in education and international relations. He moved back to Courtenay and worked as a teacher at Georges P. Vanier Secondary School from the mid-1990s until his election as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in 2009. Shortly after moving to Courtenay, he married a woman named Deanne. Together they had two daughters, one born 2004 and the second in 2009. McRae spent seven years on Courtenay city council. He was first elected in November 2002, and was re- elected in 2005 and 2008. While on council he voted against allowing business to stay open late-night, supported surveillance cameras in public areas, and led an initiative to rename streets after of specific, locally-significant people. He also supported work at establishing a walking/cycling trail across the Comox Valley, from the Town of Comox to Comox Lake. He was appointed to the Comox-Strathcona Regional District board of directors in 2006. As one of Courtenay's two Regional Directors, he supported the Vancouver Island Health Authority's controversial attempt to build a new regional hospital near Dove Creek, but he later supported a compromised position that would see a new hospital built in the Comox Valley with the Campbell River hospital remaining open for emergency and acute care. McRae disliked how the Comox-Strathcona Regional District operated, calling the urban-rural voting blocks \\"dysfunctional\\". He favoured an amalgamation of Courtenay, Cumberland, Comox, and several electoral areas to form a new regional government. McRae welcomed the province's move to split the Regional District (creating the Comox Valley Regional District and the Strathcona Regional District), and even supported a proposal to include the Comox Indian Band on the Comox Valley Regional District's Board of Directors. Provincial politics After Comox Valley MLA Stan Hagen suddenly died of a heart attack in January 2009, the BC Liberal Party had to nominate someone new for the up-coming May 2009 general election. Along with McRae, 3 other people stood for the nomination: B.C. Shellfish Growers' Association executive director Roberta Stevenson, Salvation Army manager Shawn Wilson, Habitat for Humanity worker Jon Toogood, and Comox Valley Airport Commissioner Ken Dawson (though Dawson withdrew several weeks before the nomination vote). The vote was held on March 12, with 650 registered BC Liberal members and a preferential voting system, and McRae won the nomination on the third ballot. Campaigning for the May general election began soon afterwards where he faced BC NDP candidate and log scaler Leslie McNabb, BC Green Party candidate and author Hazel Lennox, BC Refederation Party and forest industry administrator Paula Berard, and People's Front candidate and health-care worker Barbara Biley. The riding was predicted to have a very competitive race and was \\"too close to call\\". McRae was supported by Minister of Finance and fellow BC Liberal Colin Hansen who visited Courtenay to attend a McRae campaign event. McRae was criticized in the campaign for failing to attend a debate on Education. McRae won the riding with 47% of the vote in the 39th general election with his BC Liberal Party forming the government after winning 49 of province's 85 seats. Don McRae, Minister of Agriculture As the 39th Parliament of British Columbia began, McRae was not selected for the Executive Council by Premier Gordon Campbell. McRae was assigned to three parliamentary committees: Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services, Select Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, and the Select Standing Committee on Health. In the parliament's second session he was also assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Children and Youth. McRae defended the government budget presented in September 2009 but was disappointed it ran a deficit, blaming an unexpected drop in revenue. Nonetheless, McRae was able to participate in government funding announcements, like $347,400 for ecosystem restoration at the Mount Washington Alpine Resort, and additional funds for sewer upgrades within his riding. As a member of the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services which introduced the Harmonized Sales Tax McRae faced significant attention from the Fight HST group organized to oppose the tax. The group collected over 10,000 signatures from the Comox Valley riding on a petition opposing the HST and launched a recall initiative against McRae. McRae sought legal advice against the recall initiative which he claimed were spreading mis-information, specifically that the group was claiming 12,000 people in his riding had signed the petition against the HST, not 10,000 people. However, the effort to recall McRae eventually failed, having only collected 5,181 of the 19,000 signatures required. Despite McRae supporting the HST, tax payers provincially and in his own riding did not. The subsequent province-wide HST referendum resulted in 14,759 votes (53%) to extinguish the HST system in McRae's Comox Valley riding, with 55% province-wide voting to extinguish the HST. During the BC Liberal Party leadership election to replace BC Liberal leader, and BC Premier, Gordon Campbell, McRae endorsed George Abbott in December. In March 2011, after Christy Clark won the leadership election and was named Premier, she included McRae into her Executive Council as Minister of Agriculture. Without a background in farming, McRae underwent a steep learning curve which involved travelling across the province to learn about the issues. As the minister responsible, McRae accepted the recommendations of the Sled Dog Task Force which investigated the slaughter of nearly 100 sled dogs in Whistler following a drop in tourism after the 2010 Winter Olympics. He followed through with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act, 2011, which was introduced on May 11 and adopted on June 2. The amendment act increased potential fines to $75,000 and jail terms to two years for animal cruelty charges and extended the statute of limitations on such charges to three years. In a minor cabinet shuffle, McRae, was promoted to Minister of Education on September 5, 2012. After the Liberals won the 2013 provincial election, McRae returned to cabinet with the portfolio of Minister of Social Development and Social Innovation. In February 2015, McRae tendered his resignation from Cabinet in order to deal with family matters.

William Rush and His Model is the collective name given to several paintings by Thomas Eakins, one set from 1876‚Äì77 and the other from 1908. These works depict the American wood sculptor William Rush in 1808, carving his statue Water Nymph and Bittern for a fountain at Philadelphia's first waterworks. The water nymph is an allegorical figure representing the Schuylkill River, which provided the city's drinking water, and on her shoulder is a bittern, a native waterbird related to the heron. Hence, these Eakins works are also known as William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River. Nymph and Bittern Fourth of July in Centre Square ( 1812), by John Lewis Krimmel. Philadelphia's first waterworks was located at Centre Square, now the site of Philadelphia City Hall. Steam engines drew drinking water from the Schuylkill River and pumped it up to tanks in the engine house tower, from which it was distributed by gravity through underground mains to the city. Rush, a carver of ship figureheads, was commissioned in 1808 to carve an allegorical statue to be the centerpiece of an ornamental fountain. His pine statue was painted white to imitate marble, and its water jet gushed from the mouth of the bittern held atop the nymph's shoulder. Art historian Elizabeth Milroy notes that the nymph's pose recalls the Venus de' Medici, a copy of which was owned by a Philadelphia painter. Local legend tells that the daughter of a Watering Committee member posed as Rush's model.Milroy, 2016, p. 159. When the Centre Square waterworks was demolished in 1829, the statue was relocated to a fountain at the nearby Fairmount Waterworks.Milroy, 2016, p. 189. Following more than 60 years of exposure to water and the elements, Nymph and Bittern was stripped of its white paint in 1872, and a bronze copy was cast. The copy became the centerpiece of a new fountain at Fairmount, and the rotting original was placed in storage.William Rush, American Sculptor, exhibition catalogue, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 1982, pp. 114‚Äì17. Eakins and Rush The bronze copy of Nymph and Bittern (cast 1872), in the 1930s. Eakins's interest in William Rush originated from a desire to restore Rush's name to prominence in the history of American art. Eakins taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, of which Rush had been a founder. Eakins was a strong believer in teaching human anatomy, and insisted that his students study from nude models. Since it is unlikely that Rush had employed a nude model for his sculpture of a draped water nymph,Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1995, 287 the painting may be viewed as Eakins's demonstration of the importance of studying anatomy from nudes. Eakins was able to study both versions of the statue, and his notes document the deteriorated condition of the wooden original. Only its head survives, in the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.Head of the Nymph, from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.

As part of his process of creating the painting, Eakins carved wax studies of the nymph, her head, Rush's head, the nude model, and the other Rush sculptures depicted. Five of the six wax studies survive, in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA).Susan James-Gadzinzki and Mary Mullen Cunningham, American Sculpture in the Museum of American Art of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, University of Washington Press, 1997, pp. 90‚Äì93. =Studies= At Yale University Art Gallery is what appears to be an abandoned version of the painting (G-111), presumed to pre-date the finished version at PMA. This is sometimes called a study, but it is almost the same size as the finished version, contains the same figures (although the chaperone faces a different direction), and was never displayed during Eakins's lifetime. At the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Maine is an oil study for another composition (G-110). The model stands on a higher pedestal, and the chaperone has been placed between the model and Rush. Judging from a photograph in a 1938 auction catalogue, G-110 seems to be cut down from a larger study.1938 auction catalogue photo from SIRIS. =Finished version= The finished version of William Rush and His Model (G-109, Philadelphia Museum of Art) has the model slightly rotated, and the chaperone to the model's right, facing Rush. In the foreground, between Rush and the model, stands a chair conspicuously displaying the model's clothes. Rush's life-sized figure of George Washington (1815), and his Allegorical Figure of The Waterworks (1825)‚Äîa reclining female figure manipulating a waterwheel‚Äîare visible in the background. Although the painting is historically inaccurate‚ÄîRush carved Water Nymph and Bittern in 1808, and the other statues years later‚ÄîEakins's intent seems to have been to present a survey of the sculptor's whole career. The painting was first exhibited in January 1878 at the Boston Art Club, and later that year at the Society of American Artists in New York. It immediately sparked controversy with one New York reviewer writing, \\"What ruins the picture is much less the want of beauty in the model ... than the presence in the foreground of the clothes of that young woman, cast carelessly over a chair. This gives the shock which makes one think about the nudity‚Äîand at once the picture becomes improper.\\"Sewell, 2001, p. 45. =Sketches and preparatory studies= File:Eakins G109 Nymph With Bittern.jpgSketch of Water Nymph and Bittern (1876), Hirshhorn Museum.

His first 1908 version (G-445, now in the Brooklyn Museum) is similar to the PMA version, however, Rush and his statue have been moved to the far right, the chaperone is to the model's left, facing the viewer, and the pile of the model's clothes has been eliminated. This is the least successful composition, with little visual connection between Rush and the model. The second 1908 version (G-451, in the Honolulu Museum of Art) shows a frontal view of the nude model descending the platform. She is neither idealized nor sentimentalized.Johnson, 1978, p. 21. Rush is now out of the shadows and holding the model's hand as if helping a grand lady descend from a carriage. The chaperone and background sculptures are omitted from this version.

Marsinah was serving as a negotiator for 500 workers striking over failure to implement the minimum wage and trade union autonomy. On May 4th, she was kidnapped following a demonstration; her body was found four days later.Hellwig and Tagliacozzo (2009). The Indonesia Reader: History, Culture, Politics. Duke University Press. Durham and London. p 393 The military is widely believed to have been involved in her disappearance and subsequent death.  Early life  The second child of Sumini and Mastin, Marsinah grew up under the care of her grandmother, Puirah, and her aunt Sini, in Nglundo, East Java. She went to school at Karangasem Public School 189, subsequently Nganjuk No.5 Middle School. Her girlhood years were marked with commerce, selling snacks in order to augment her grandmother and aunt's incomes. Marsinah's final school years were spent at the Muhammadiyah Boarding School, her educational advancement being denied due to lack of money.  Factory worker  Unable to find employment in Nglundo, Marsinah turned her attention to the big cities, sending in job applications to Surabaya, Mojokerto and Gresik. Hired by Bata Shoes to work at their Surabaya factory in 1989, she moved a year later to the Catur Putra Surya (formerly Empat Putra Surya) watch factory in Sidoarjo. Making a lateral transfer to their Porong factory after its opening, Marsinah eventually found herself serving as spokesperson for her fellow workers.  Trade unionist  When, in 1993, the Governor of East Java announced a raise in the provincial minimum wage, Catur Putra Surya (a company with ties to the Indonesian military‚Äìindustrial complex) refused to comply. On 3-4 Mary workers went on strike demanding implementation of the minimum wage and the local unit of the state-controlled union, SPSI, be disbanded. Marsinah went to the Indonesian Ministry of Labor to retrieve a copy of the gubernatorial directive to deliver to the CPS management.  Murder  alt=A woman demonstrator in sunglasses waves a white flag depicting the face of murdered trade unionist Marsinah.

He was the author of an English grammar, which was written, however, in Latin. Life He was born in Lincolnshire 7 February 1565, admitted as a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in September 1583, and earned a B.A. in 1586 and an M.A. in 1589. Wood believed that he was a schoolmaster at Norwich, where he was living in 1597. On 10 March 1607-8 he was appointed high-master of St. Paul's School, succeeding Richard Mulcaster. Milton was among his pupils from 1620 to 1625. He had two sons, George and Alexander (b. 1597), and a daughter, Annah. George Gill would eventually become ordained. In 1628, his son Alexander was overheard drinking to the health of John Felton, who had stabbed George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Buckingham was a favorite of King Charles I, but hated by the public. Felton was widely acclaimed as a hero for assassinating him. Gill the Younger was sentenced to have both ears removed and was fined ¬£2000. However, his father intervened directly with William Laud. This effort managed a remission of the punishment inflicted by the Star Chamber. Alexander Gill the Younger would later become a noted scholar in his own right. Gill the Elder died at his house in St. Paul's Churchyard 17 November 1635, and was buried 20 November in Mercers' Chapel. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth.

In his section on grammatical and rhetorical figures Gill quotes freely from Edmund Spenser, George Wither, Samuel Daniel, and other English poets.

During the 2012 Summer Olympics, Pedersen officiated the semi-final match between Canada and the United States. In the 78th minute, a controversial delay of game call was made against the Canadian goalkeeper, Erin McLeod, when she held the ball longer than the allowed six seconds. This violation is rarely called in international play, or at any other level of soccer, and is only intended to be used during instances of clear and deliberate time-wasting. As a result, the American side was awarded a rare indirect free-kick in the box, in the eightieth minute, with Canada leading the match 3‚Äì2. On the ensuing play, another controversial handball call was made against the Canadian side, awarding the American team a penalty kick, which Abby Wambach converted to tie the game at 3‚Äì3. The Americans went on to win the match in extra time, advancing to the gold medal match. After the match, Canada forward Christine Sinclair stated, \\"the ref decided the result before the game started.\\" FIFA responded by saying it was considering disciplinary action against Sinclair, but that any disciplinary action would be postponed until after the end of the tournament.

It focuses on then professional basketball player Kobe Bryant before, during, and immediately after one game of the 2007‚Äì08 Los Angeles Lakers season against the San Antonio Spurs. Bryant granted filmmaker Spike Lee and 30 cameras total access to his life for one day. Bryant agreed to wear a microphone throughout the day capturing in-game, bench, and locker room conversations. Lee's cameras were also given unprecedented access to the Laker locker room. Kobe: Doin' Work premiered on ESPN on May 16, 2009. Plot Kobe Doin‚Äô Work is an 84-minute exploration of Kobe Bryant's work ethic, his in game mentality, and the bluntness that made Bryant a great competitor. Lee uses multiple cameras, sound from the in-game broadcast, the Staples Center, a microphone worn by Kobe himself, and a follow-up narration while he watched the footage to illustrate every detail of Kobe's performance, strategy, and inner thoughts. Bryant shot 6 of 14 from the field, scored 20 points, and played 32 minutes. The game was a crucial game in the end of the regular season, as the Los Angeles Lakers hoped to keep first place in the Western Conference with a record of 55-25. In an NBA.com 2009 Q&A; (now archived) Spike Lee explained in an interview why he chose Kobe Bryant as the subject for this documentary: \\"I'm a big basketball fan. It was obvious. He was having an MVP-type year, in which he did win the MVP. Also the Lakers looked like they were going to take it to the Finals. And I wanted them to beat the Celtics. I hate the Celtics. But the Celtics won. But I don't think I was taking a gamble by choosing Kobe.\\" Also, according to Spike Lee, \\"He (Kobe) said several times how much fun it was just doing it.\\" The 84-minute documentary ran on ESPN commercial free. The documentary also focuses on Bryant and the team in huddles and during time-outs. The cameras also get full access of coach Phil Jackson in the locker room with the team during half-time. Bryant provided the voice-over for the documentary on February 2, 2009, hours after he scored 61 points against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, (then a single-game record at the arena, which has been broken since). Spike Lee said that he was excited for Bryant to do the commentary following a game at Madison Square Garden, but no one expected a 61-point performance from Bryant. \\"I know that if he had a terrible game the commentary would not have been the same. Guaranteed. But Kobe said he made a point to make sure not to lose the game or he would hear it from me.\\" Bryant indeed said in an after game interview that he was going to give the game his all in order to show Spike Lee a thing or two about Bryant's skills on the court against the Knicks. \\"On a lighter note, I'm going to review this documentary I'm doing with Spike Lee tonight after the game and I didn't feel like sitting next to him and hearing him talking trash about the Knicks, so that was added incentive as well. Seriously. He's going to get an earful tonight.\\" Reception Ryan Cracknell of Movie Views gave it a negative review.http://movieviews.ca/kobe-doin-work Gabe Leibowitz of Film and Felt gave it a positive review.http://filmandfelt.com/blog/kobe- doin-work-lee-2009/ Notes This film bears a striking resemblance to the 2006 sports documentary Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait (), as well as to a much earlier film: Football As Never Before (), a documentary made in 1970 by acclaimed German filmmaker :de:Hellmuth Costard about Manchester United footballer George Best.

They have authored a series of recordings and concerts featuring music by Johannes Ockeghem, Josquin des Prez, Jacob Obrecht and other composers of the Franco-Flemish Renaissance. History Formed by Edward Wickham in 1992 from choral scholars (also known as Academical Clerks ‚Äì hence the name) at Oxford University, the ensemble was soon signed by the record label ASV (later Sanctuary Classics). During the 1990s The Clerks‚Äô recording profile focussed on the music of Johannes Ockeghem, whose complete sacred music the ensemble finished recording in 1999, picking up a Gramophone Award in the process. Several other recordings have focussed on previously neglected repertoire and composers, such as Jacob Barbireau, Johannes Tinctoris and Johannes Regis. More recently The Clerks have moved into contemporary music and have given premieres of work by several British composers, including Robert Saxton, Gabriel Jackson and Christopher Fox. They commissioned Ian Duhig to write new poems for 'Le Roman de Fauvel', which was first performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on the South Bank in 2007, and enthusiastically reviewed in The New York Times when performed in that city in 2009. The Clerks have been associated with pioneering work in the field of performance practice, in particular singing from facsimiles of Renaissance manuscript sources, a process heavily influenced by the work of Margaret Bent and John Milsom. Several recordings were made in this way, and the experience has since informed the group‚Äôs approach to the rehearsal and performance.

Haig, The New Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary, Tuttle, 1997, p. 1132. History T≈çdai-ji's Kon-d≈ç's facade is 7 ken across The ken is based on the Chinese jian. It uses the same Chinese character as the Korean kan. A building's proportions were (and, to a certain extent, still are) measured in ken, as for example in the case of Enryaku-ji's Konponch≈´-d≈ç (Main Hall), which measures 11√ó6 bays (37.60 m √ó 23.92 m), of which 11√ó4 are dedicated to the worshipers. Inside buildings, available space was often divided in squares measuring one ken across, and each square was then called a , the term written with the same Chinese character as ken. Traditional buildings usually measure an odd number of bays, for example 3√ó3 or 5√ó5. A type of temple's gate called r≈çmon can have dimensions going from 5√ó2 bays to the more common 3√ó2 bays down to even 1√ó1 bay. The Zen butsuden in the illustration measures 5√ó5 ken across externally because its 3√ó3 ken core (moya) is surrounded by a 1-ken aisle called hisashi. The value of a ken could change from building to building, but was usually kept constant within the same structure. There can however be exceptions. Kasuga Taisha's tiny honden's dimensions, for example, are 1√ó1 in ken, but 1.9√ó2.6 in meters. In the case of Izumo Taisha's honden, a ken is , well above its standard value.JAANUS, Taisha-zukuri, accessed on December 1, 2009 The distance between pillars was standardized very early and started being used as a unit of measurement. Land area in particular was measured using the ken as a basis. The unit was born out of the necessity to measure land surface to calculate taxes. At the time of Toyotomi Hideyoshi (16th century), the ken was about , but around 1650 the Tokugawa shogunate reduced it to specifically to increase taxes.

He was also an anti- opium fighter, philanthropist and social reformer. He served in a number of important committees including the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Management Committee, the Central Midwives Board and the Council of King Edward VII College of Medicine. After the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, he joined the Advisory Council where he spoke out against social ills caused by the war. He founded the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in 1945 and formed the Chen Su Lan Trust in 1947. Early life Chen was born in Fuzhou, China as a third-generation Methodist. He enrolled at Anglo-Chinese College in Fuzhou when he was 15. At a revival meeting led by visiting Bishop Bradford, he pledged to become a preacher one day. In 1905, he left for Singapore and enrolled to become one of the first students at the newly opened Straits Federated Malay States Government Medical School (now known as Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine). He obtained a Licentiate in Medicine at 1910, as part of the first batch of seven graduates. In addition, he also topped that class. After graduation, he was not only busy with his own practice but he served on a number of important committees, including the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Management Committee, the Central Midwives Board and the Council of King Edward VII College of Medicine. He also founded the Alumni Association of the Medical College was elected president of the Malayan branch of the British Medical Association. Anti-opium fight Chen was deeply concerned with the social and health conditions in Singapore. He recognised that opium addiction was a grim social problem, not helped by the fact that the colonial government monopolised the sale of the drug as means to regulate its use. At the risk of being labelled disloyal to the British, Chen mounted a campaign against opium addiction. He was the president of the Singapore Anti-Opium Society and the director of the Anti-Opium Clinic which he founded in 1933. However, in 1937, the outbreak of war in China caused donations to be diverted to the China Relief Fund and thus the clinic had to close down. Pacific War When the Pacific War broke out in December 1941, the Japanese army made steady progress in its conquest of the Malayan peninsula. Chen, who felt that Singapore would fall, decided to flee from the island. On 13 February 1942, he boarded one of the last ships leaving Singapore but unfortunately, the ship was attacked, bombed and set on fire. The passengers abandoned ship and Chen found himself adrift in the cold sea, clinging on to a raft with a few other survivors. During those hours in the water, he re-evaluated his life and realised he had not kept to his childhood commitment to be a preacher. He decided to live fully for God and not himself. Upon landing on shore at a mangrove forest, Chen returned home only to be detained by the Kempeitai (Japanese military police). An informer had told the Japanese that Chen and other leaders of the Methodist Church were conspiring against the Japanese government. Although his home was searched, no evidence was found which would incriminate him, and he was released. After Japanese occupation After the war, the British Military Administration invited Chen to join the Advisory Council. Chen took the opportunity to speak out boldly against the numerous social problems that had arisen because of the war. To help solve these problems, in 1945, he founded the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association (now called the Metropolitan YMCA) to help provide demoralised youths with opportunities to rehabilitate themselves. Chen Su Lan Trust Turning to his personal interest and commitment, he founded the Chen Su Lan Trust in 1947. The Trust disbursed funds and land to Christian organisations like Scripture Union, and for the founding in 1968 of the Methodist Children's Home which was named after him. Book In 1969, Chen published a book entitled Pompong and Oxley Rise, which recounted his childhood days and his experiences during the Japanese Occupation. He had been planning to do this since the war as a way to express his gratitude to God. Though he had not fulfilled his commitment to be a preacher in the literal sense, his whole life had been dedicated to serve God through serving the needs of others.

Captain Bradley is best known for his part in the migration of several families from the military district of middle Tennessee during the 1810s-1820s. His leadership and continuing influence in the establishment of the town of Warren, led to the naming of the county in his honor when it was formed in 1840. The Flatboat Journey The Bradleys and several other families, set out from Round Lick, Wilson County, Tennessee in 1818, in flatboats. Probably, they used the Mississippi to travel to the mouth of the Atchafalaya River in southern Louisiana. From there, they traveled north on the Atchafalaya to the Red River which runs through central Louisiana from the northwest, poling upstream as far as Natchitoches. Until 1839, the Red River was not navigable from just north of Natchitoches to what is now Shreveport, due to the Great Raft, a natural logjam which had prevented river traffic since the beginning of American exploration of the Louisiana Territory. The Bradleys found a route northward, making it to the place now known as Bradley, Arkansas Among Bradley's many family members making the trek to new land were his niece Mary Jane \\"Polly\\" Bradley, who would later become the first First Lady of the State of Arkansas. Her burial place alongside her husband, the first state governor, James Sevier Conway, is on the old site of the Walnut Hill plantation, near the small community of Bradley, in Hempstead County, Arkansas. Although enough of the Bradley family stayed there to merit the naming of the community, some time around 1826, Captain Bradley and several other families in his company moved a bit more eastward, near the Saline River, in a place that would become the town of Warren. Bradley County Statehood arrived for Arkansas in 1836. At the time, the location of what is now Bradley County was included in the boundaries of Union County. In late 1840, Bradley County was formed and named after one of its most prominent citizens Hugh Bradley.

It was released by Columbia Pictures. The story is based on the 1957 novel Last Stand at Papago Wells by Louis L'Amour. It was Calhoun's last film before moving to television as The Texan on CBS. It was also the final film in the career of co-star Barbara Bates. The film was shot on location at Red Rock Canyon, California. Plot Drifter Logan Cates (Rory Calhoun) spies the desert at a watering hole when he sees Apache Indians about to attack three cowboys. He fires a warning shot into the air, allowing the cowboys to flee. Sometime later, Cates encounters a young woman whose parents have been tortured and murdered by Apache Indians. Sensing the presence of Apaches, Logan brings the girl to a small box canyon that is not only defensible but has a supply of water. He meets up with 19-year-old Lonnie Foreman, who was the only survivor of the group that Cates warned before. The location attracts a variety of people escaping the Apaches including a small band of cavalrymen, Logan's former girlfriend, Jennifer Fair, and her fiancee, Grant Kimbrough. On the first night in the canyon, a Pima Indian named Lugo sneaks in looking for water. Though he is wanted for murder by the United States for killing an officer who wanted Lugo's gold, Cates allows him to stay due to his hatred towards the Apache. Lonnie and Junie Hatchett, the girl who Cates rescued earlier, quickly grow attached to one another. They are besieged by Apache, where Logan the loner gradually discovers that he can not escape the responsibility of leadership of the group through his knowledge of Indian fighting and the local territory as well as his ability to knock sense into their heads when they engage in unhelpful behaviour. The numbers of the cavalrymen slowly dwindle, with initial attacks killing off one soldier as well as the sergeant. One of the cavalrymen, Zimmerman, hatches a plan to escape with Kimbrough, though Jennifer doesn't agree with the plan. Zimmerman is killed when he steals Lugo's gold and runs into the desert, where he is quickly shot. Lugo, however, hid his gold supply and Zimmerman only stole rocks. As their food supplies dwindle, Cates risks his life by invading the Apache camp for food. Shortly thereafter, their water supplies begin to dwindle as well. Cates motions to ration off the water. More Apache attacks cause the deaths of more cavalrymen, until only Webb and Conley are left. A fellow officer's death leaves Webb enraged, and he runs blindly into the Apache camp, where he is wounded and taken. That night, the sound of his tortured cries torments the survivors. Cates leaves and it is implied that he ends the horror by shooting Webb. As the wind picks up, Cates to put a plan into action: under the cover of a sandstorm, they will fill empty water bottles with black powder and small stones to make grenades and scatter the Apache across the desert. As they prepare to leave, Kimbrough disagrees with Cates' plan to leave Lugo with the women, and though he journeys out with the other men, he quickly returns so he can flee. Jennifer realizes Kimbrough is nothing but a coward and breaks off their engagement. Kimbrough tries to leave but is stopped by Lugo. Kimbrough attempts to draw his gun but Lugo shoots him dead. Elsewhere, Cates, Conley and Lonnie find the Apache horde. Cates and Lonnie light and throw their grenades successfully, but Conley simply runs into the Apache nest like a suicide bomber. The two return to the Box Canyon, where Jennifer reveals the fate of Kimbrough. After the storm passes, Lugo reveals he hid his gold in Cates' saddlebags, and gives a share of his gold to Lonnie so he and Junie can move to California. Lugo, Lonnie and Junie leave, with only Cates and Jennifer remaining. Jennifer leaves, with Cates catching up to her and the two riding off into the distance.

Currently, the Domus Galilaeana houses a library with more than 40,000 books and important files appertaining to scientists of the 20th century.  History  The idea of creating an institute dedicated to the Pisan scientist was born in 1938 in anticipation of the celebrations for the centenary of the First Meeting of Italian scientists held in Pisa in 1839. The institute‚Äôs formation was the initiative of Giovanni Gentile and sponsored by the Italian Society for the Progress of Sciences, and was established in Rome with a commission to identify goals and objectives of the new society, as well as the city and its location within the city. The choice fell on Pisa. The presentation was made in 1939 in the Aula Magna of the University of Pisa. The Domus Galilaeana received its legal status with the law of 1941. Since then, the establishment has collected all the ancient and modern publications on Galileo and coordinated studies in the history of science, thanks to a large archive and a major library. In 2002 this public institution turned into a foundation, becoming subject to private law. Headquarters The Head of the Institute is located in Santa Maria street, in the old Palazzotto Specola, situated between the houses of Antonio Pacinotti and Gabba. It is not the birthplace of Galileo, which can be found near the tribunal court, but the building that once housed the university library and the observatory tower for astronomical observation. The tower was demolished in the early part of the 19th century because of its instability. Museum The Domus Galilaeana can not be considered a real museum. Throughout its history it has retained various scientific instruments on behalf of other institutions. It housed the instruments of Enrico Fermi, now in Rome, and equipment belonging to Antonio Pacinotti, now in the Museo degli Strumenti per il Calcolo di Pisa, including the \\"Macchinetta\\", the first model of an electric motor generator. Domus has also saved from destruction the CEP, Pisana Electronic Calculator, which forms part of the Museo degli Strumenti per il Calcolo collection. The instrumentation currently present at the Domus is closely bound to the archives found here, along with the \\"sources\\" for the experiments on induced radioactivity of Enrico Fermi, the photographic instrumentation of the astronomer Pius Emanuelle and various machines from the Institute of Technical Physics, University of Pisa. Regular courses dedicated to schools are held on the most important characters in the history of science, from Galileo Galilei to the physicists of the 20th century.Domus Galilaeana, official site.

It is widely known for its unique flavor profile of floral and sweet notes, its high selling price, and elusive prestige as its demand increases over the years.  History  Coffee production in Ethiopia dates back dozens of centuries. The Geisha variety of Coffea arabica was identified in the 1930s, in the mountainous Gesha region of southwestern Ethiopia. After seeds were collected in 1936 by a British consul, the coffee was planted in Tanzania and Costa Rica. From there, cultivation spread to Panama in the 1960s, including the famed Boquete region.  Growing and Processing  Geisha Cherries Gesha Coffee begins with a thoughtful process of picking the ripest cherries. Producers prefer hand-picked cherries which increases the labor costs. The riper the cherry the sweeter the coffee. The cherries then go through quality inspection. Some producers have the technology to put their cherries into a machine that deciphers the quality of the cherries. Smaller producers have workers sort through the picked cherries by hand. The cherries are processed either by means of wet or dry methods. After those methods are complete, the producers end with a Gesha coffee bean.  Preparation  The preparation of Gesha Coffee starts with the grinding process. This process is vital to making the coffee the correct way. The temperature of the water plays a key role as to whether the coffee will taste bitter or not. Also you must use filter water. The last step is to basically learn to take your time when brewing this specific type of coffee.  Flavor Profile  The flavor profile of Geisha coffee is one aspect that contributes to its renown. Geisha is known for its sweet flavor and aroma of floral notes, jasmine, chocolate, honey, and even black tea. This unique flavor is also one of the contributing factors for Geisha‚Äôs high price tag, and prestige.  Sales & Auction prices  Esmerelda Geisha Coffee The Best of Panama Coffee Competition has a long standing reputation for having high dollar coffee at auction which is where geisha asserted itself as one of the worlds highest costing coffees. This occurred in 2004 when Hacienda La Esmeralda entered the coffee into the competition where it was found to be a distinctly unusual taste before being purchased at auction for a record price of twenty-one dollars a pound. This was just the beginning for geisha coffee, as fifteen years later at the same Best of Panama Competition and Auction, geisha sold for an astounding $1,029 a pound (unroasted). Earning the nickname ‚ÄúElida Natural Geisha 1029,‚Äù this geisha was produced on the Lamastus Family Estates. A hundred pounds of geisha coffee sold for over a hundred thousand dollars, out valuing the next closest coffee by eighty thousand dollars. It is definitely fair to say that geisha is the most valuable coffee in the world. References # Hoffmann, James (11 November 2014). The World Atlas of Coffee. Firefly Books. p. 24.

He was a resident ambassador to the Netherlands from 1632 to 1649. Life William Boswell was a native of Suffolk. He was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, of which he was elected fellow in 1606. He was incorporated at Oxford University on 12 July 1608 and became proctor in 1624. He was one of the keepers of the state paper office. In 1624 he was elected Member of Parliament for Boston in a by-election to the Happy Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Boston in 1625.'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500-1714: Bludworth-Brakell', Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714 (1891), pp. 142-170. Date accessed: 8 May 2012 Boswell subsequently entered the diplomatic service, and was appointed secretary to Sir Dudley Carleton, then ambassador at The Hague. Boswell eventually succeeded Carleton in 1632. He was knighted at Bockstal near Baldock on 25 July 1633. A large share of Sir William's attention while ambassador was taken up with the controversy between the Gomarists and the Remonstrants (Arminians). He continued the policy of Sir Dudley Carleton, and supported the rigidly Calvinist Gomarists against the Remonstrants. This was for political reasons, and otherwise Boswell was an ally of William Laud. He took a close interest in the √©migr√© English churches in the Netherlands, and in 1633-4 helped John Paget intrigue against John Davenport.Sprunger, p. 115. Charles I ordered Boswell to back Edward Misselden, influential in the Merchant Adventurers, against John Forbes.Hugh Trevor-Roper, Archbishop Laud (1962 edition), pp. 264-9. In 1638 Boswell had a prosecution brought against John Canne.Sprunger, p. 76. He was now poised against the Gomarists, and worked together with Remonstrants to combat Scottish Covenanter propaganda. When the First English Civil War broke out, Boswell's efforts were directed towards preserving the neutrality of the Dutch. Despite the efforts of Walter Strickland, who was sent over by Oliver Cromwell to counteract his influence, he was quite successful in his political mission. He could not prevent Parliament appealing to Dutch public opinion, however. Despite Boswell's appeals to the Dutch authorities to ban Parliamentary propaganda, it circulated widely in the Republic, and Boswell found himself compelled to respond by publishing royalist pamphlets. Sir William was also a man of letters and a scholar, as is shown in his correspondence with John de Laet, which touches upon subjects ranging from Oriental literature and the compilation of an Arab dictionary to Edward VI's treatise 'De Primatu Papae,' and Sir Simon d'Ewes's Saxon vocabulary.

The film was an adaption of a sensational 1926 hit play by Charles MacArthur and Edward Sheldon, about a mulatto songstress, a \\"man-trap\\" who bewitched powerful men in New Orleans. This convoluted but heavily Code-sanitized film version of the play was about a Caucasian songbird who could not be true to her boxer beau. Although the film offered a change of pace for its star, Dorothy Lamour, it was not a success at the box office. Plot Famous Broadway singer Lulu Belle (Dorothy Lamour) and Harry Randolph (Otto Kruger), her rich suitor, are found shot and severely wounded in her dressing room one night after the show. They are discovered by Lulu's best friend, Molly Benson (Glenda Farrell), and taken unconscious to the hospital. Lulu's ex-husband, George Davis (George Montgomery), is accused of the shooting, since he has been previously convicted of attempted murder of another man who got too close to Lulu. During George's interrogation he tells the story of how he met Lulu for the first time. She was performing in a dodgy place called the Natchez Caf√©, and he was so taken with her that he left his fianc√©e and law practice to elope with her to New Orleans. They lived a wild life of luxury for awhile until his money ran out. She left for another man, high-stakes gambler Mark Brady (Albert Dekker) to support her expensive lifestyle. George realizes that Lulu is bad news and leaves her. It doesn't take long before they get back together again. Lulu is offered a job by Mark, as a singer at a club he is starting, and George starts drinking heavily to drown his sorrows. He tries to get Molly to help stop Lulu's way of life. Lulu wants to divorce him to set him free. That night a wealthy man named Harry Randolph comes to visit the club with his wife (Charlotte Wynters). He is immediately smitten with Lulu, and decides to help her become a star on Broadway. George picks a fight with boxer Butch and is beaten black and blue. George manages to stick a fork in Butch's eye and put an end to his fighting career. For this he is convicted and sentenced to prison. Lulu goes with Randolph, her new benefactor, to New York and Broadway. Randolph puts a lot of money and effort into building Lulu's career and a theater. After five years of working close together, Randolph asks Lulu to marry him. Lulu finds out that George has been released from prison and asks him to come her apartment. Mark turns up later in the evening at the theater and tries to force Lulu to come back with him, but she refuses. George meets Lulu right after the show that night and is sucked into her beam of charm again, when she proclaims her love for him. They decide to start a new life together. Without hesitation, Lulu tells Randolph that she won't marry him and he is upset. Then comes the night of the shooting. Returning to the present, police commissioner Dixon (Addison Richards) gathers all the persons involved in the story, including Mrs. Randolph, at the dying Randolph's bedside. He asks Randolph to tell them who the shooter was, and he reveals it was his wife. George is vindicated and freed of all charges. He stays by Lulu's side long enough to make sure she will recover, then returns to his hometown alone.Lulu Belle details, tcm.com; accessed October 3, 2015.

This unique \\"think- and-do-tank\\" presented workshop versions of productions, exposing the process of creation and fostering civic discourse on the themes expressed by the work. Activities included development of new works of art, group discussions, guest speakers, seminars and workshops for participants and selected guests, collaborative research, master classes, public forums and media projects.

Lawrence Murphy case Lawrence Murphy was a priest who taught at the former St. John School for the Deaf in the Milwaukee suburb of St. Francis from 1950 to 1974. He is believed to have molested up to 200 deaf boys before the mid-1970s. Local law enforcement agencies, including the Milwaukee Police Department, the St. Francis police, and the Milwaukee County District Attorney, were informed of the abuse in 1974 by adult graduates of the St. John School for the Deaf, but expressed doubts about the credibility of the allegations and the statute of limitations, and did not proceed.\\"Lawrence Murphy\\", Archdiocese of Milwaukee Then Milwaukee Archbishop William Edward Cousins gave Murphy a leave of absence in 1974 and allowed him to move to his mother's house in Boulder Junction, Wisconsin, which is in the Diocese of Superior. In September 1981 the Chancellor of the Archdiocese wrote the Bishop of Superior asking him to consider taking Murphy as a priest of Superior, but the suggestion was not acted upon. Murphy finally retired as a priest of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee in January 1993. Rembert Weakland, Archbishop of Milwaukee, had Murphy evaluated by a psychotherapist in December 1993. During the interview, Murphy admitted molesting boys at least up until 1974, including during the sacrament of penance, which is an offense under canon law. In July 1996, Weakland notified the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and asked how to proceed. Although the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith at the time did not have jurisdiction over most incidents involving sexual abuse by priests, it did have authority over cases involving solicitation by priests during the sacrament of penance. Weakland stated that \\"[I] got an answer back saying yes. We could open the case\\", and the process against Murphy was begun in October 1996. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone instructed Wisconsin bishops to convene a canonical trial, which could have resulted in a range of punishments, including laicization. A formal church trial was initiated but later dropped because Archbishop Weakland decided that a pastoral solution was more appropriate because Murphy was elderly and in poor health. Murphy died several months after he requested that the Vatican halt a canonical trial against him because of his ill health. The Vatican has responded to concerns by noting that they had not been informed of the allegations until 20 years after they were first raised; that Murphy died within two years of Vatican notification of the allegations; that police investigations into the allegations at the time did not result in any cases being heard; and that there was nothing in the Vatican's actions that would prevent civil cases from proceeding.\\"Vatican Declines to Defrock US Priest Who Abused Boys\\", New York Times, March 25, 2010.

Weakland admitted allowing priests guilty of child sex abuse to continue as priests without warning parishioners or alerting the police.Archbishop Rembert Weakland, Former Catholic Bishop Of Milwaukee, Says He's Gay Weakland stated in his autobiography that in the early years of the sexual abuse scandal he did not understand that child sexual abuse was a crime. 2003 report on sexual abuse Following public testimony by victims before a combined session of the Wisconsin State Senate and Assembly Judiciary Committee, a report on the sexual abuse of minors by clergy in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee was published in September 2003. In response, Archbishop Timothy Dolan held a meeting with victims, mental health professionals, law enforcement officers, and clergy. Dolan helped the archdiocese avoid bankruptcy resulting from the lawsuits, and closed a $3 million budget deficit in 2008. He later called the sexual abuse scandals the most challenging issue of his tenure in Milwaukee, saying \\"Does it haunt me? Yes it does. And I'm not afraid to admit that.\\" Dolan said the church has made significant progress on addressing the scandal but that much work remains. 2011 bankruptcy filing The archdiocese said that these additional cases would incur legal fees the diocese could not afford. The archdiocese has assets of about $98.4 million, but $90 million of that is already allocated. An attorney for some of the victims alleges that there were more than 8,000 cases of abuse by more than 100 staff. Renamed buildings On March 18, 2019, it was announced that former Archbishops William Cousins and Rembert Weakland would have their names removed from buildings in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee due to their poor handling of sex abuse cases.\\"Milwaukee Archdiocese Removes Names Of 2 Priests From Buildings\\", AP, March 19, 2019 The renaming of office center which were named in their honor commenced on March 22, 2019.https://fox6now.com/2019/03/22/milwaukee-archdiocese-reveals-new-name-of- its-diocesan-offices-were-looking-really-to-restore-trust/ Franciscan Friars controversy On September 3, 2020, it was revealed that Wisconsin Franciscan Friar Paul West was extradited to Mississippi on sex abuse charges. Father James Gannon, the leader of a Wisconsin-based group of Franciscan Friars, had previous negotiated settlements for some of West's accusers in Mississippi. In addition to the Mississippi sex abuse charges, West has been charged with sex- degree sexual assault of a child in Wisconsin.

The Beatles' booking agent, Allan Williams, decided to send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed, Derry and the Seniors, proved successful there. Having no permanent drummer at the time, they recruited Best a few days before their departure. After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being underaged, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson. The Beatles first met Astrid Kirchherr in Hamburg, who was instrumental in their adoption of the mop topped Beatle haircut. During their period in Hamburg, Sutcliffe decided to leave the group to continue his studies. In April 1962, less than a year after leaving the group, he suffered a brain hemorrhage and died as a result. Hamburg in the 1960s Hamburg had once been Germany's main seaport, the fourth largest in the world, but during World War II in 1943 virtually the entire city was reduced to rubble by bombing raids. By 1960, when they arrived, the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established a reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity. In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool, Hamburg was a wealthy city. =Leaving Liverpool= Williams, a 29-year-old Liverpool businessman and promoter, had sent his leading group, Derry and the Seniors (later known as Howie Casey and the Seniors) to Hamburg, where they were enjoying success, and wanted to send an additional group. He initially tried to send Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, but Storm and his group were committed to a Butlins holiday camp and turned Williams' offer down, as did Gerry and the Pacemakers. Williams started promoting concerts for The Beatles in May 1960, after they had played at his Jacaranda club in Liverpool, and offered The Beatles the Hamburg bookings.The Beatles, Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:38:45) Harrison talking about the offer to play in Hamburg. He booked them into Bruno Koschmider's Indra club in Hamburg for a season of bookings starting on 12 August 1960, but said that he was not impressed with them as a musical group, and hoped to find a better act to follow them. As they had no permanent drummer, McCartney looked for someone to fill the position, which was difficult, as Lennon later said that drummers were \\"few and far between\\", because a set of drums was an expensive item.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:39:18) Lennon talking about drummers. Harrison had seen Best playing with the Black Jacks in The Casbah Coffee ClubThe Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:39:01) Harrison talking about having seen Pete Best play drums. (which was run by his mother, Mona Best). He was regarded as a steady drummer, playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar, which pushed the rhythm, and was known in Liverpool at the time as being \\"mean, moody, and magnificent\\" by female fans,The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:39:07) McCartney talking about Best and his reputation. which convinced McCartney he would be good for the group.(The Beatles Anthology) DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:39:26) McCartney talking Best's reputation in Liverpool After the Black Jacks broke up, McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg, telling him they would earn ¬£15 per week each. Best had the chance to go to a teacher-training college, as he had passed his school exams, unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of theirs, but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move. The St. Pauli quarter of Hamburg, where the Indra club was located, was well known as a red light district where prostitutes were to be found, and was a dangerous place for anyone that looked different from the usual clientele. McCartney's father, Jim McCartney, was reluctant to let his teenage son go to Hamburg, but relented after a visit from Williams, who told him that he \\"shouldn't worry\\". Lennon's aunt, Mimi Smith, was also reluctant to allow Lennon to go to Hamburg, wanting Lennon to continue his studies, but Lennon placated her by exaggerating the amount he would earn. Best had an audition in Williams' Jacaranda club on 15 August 1960,The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:39:31) Harrison talking about Best's audition. and travelled to Hamburg the next day as a member of the group.(The Beatles Anthology) DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:39:49) Harrison talking about the audition with BestMy Beatle Days, by Pete Best triumphpc.com - Retrieved 26 November 2007 Williams later admitted that the audition with Best was not needed, as they had not found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg, but did not tell Best in case he asked for more money.Goldsmith (2004) p46 The group were to be paid about ¬£100 per week, which was much more than promoters in Liverpool paid. Williams drove the group and their equipment in his Austin J4 minibus which was loaded by crane onto a ferry at Harwich on 16 August 1960, and landed at Hook of Holland. All five Beatles, Williams and his wife Beryl, her brother Barry Chang, and \\"Lord Woodbine\\" were in the minivan, along with Georg Sterner (Koschmider's translator and future waiter), making a total of ten people, which resulted in a journey that was both uncomfortable and dangerous. As Williams had not obtained German work permits, they were detained at Harwich for five hours. Williams finally convinced the authorities that they were students on holiday, although work permits were later obtained after their arrival in Hamburg. Note: \\"Lord Woodbine\\" and Williams ran a strip club called New Cabaret Artistes club at 174A Upper Parliament Street in Liverpool. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe once played backing music for \\"Janice the Stripper\\" there, in July 1960. Hamburg clubs The Beatles-Platz in Hamburg In the early 1960s, the Hamburg scene revolved around the Kaiserkeller, Top Ten, Star-Club, Beer-Shop, Mambo, Holle, Wagabond, and the Pacific Hotel, as well as the less popular clubs like Grannies, the Ice Cream Shop, Chugs, and Sacha's. The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights, with posters advertising the performers in the clubs. Each club had a doorman whose job was to entice customers inside, as the drinks were expensive (for Babycham and watered-down beer). Customers who would not, or could not afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out. = The Indra and Kaiserkeller= The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007. The Beatles arrived very early in the morning of 17 August 1960, but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so infamous.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:41:14) McCartney talking about arriving in Hamburg. Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a neighbouring club found someone to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:41:47) McCartney talking about sleeping in the club on the first night. The group played at the club on the same night, but were told they could sleep in the storeroom of Bambi Kino (a small cinema), which was cold and in very poor condition (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse). McCartney later said, \\"We lived backstage in the Bambi Kino, next to the toilets, and you could always smell them. The room had been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with not very much covers‚ÄîUnion Jack flags‚Äîwe were frozen.\\" Lennon remembered: \\"We were put in this pigsty. We were living in a toilet, like right next to the ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [women] pissing next door.\\" After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid ¬£2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30‚Äì9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30‚Äì12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning. German customers found the group's name comical, as \\"Beatles\\" sounded like , which is an infantile word for penis. Harrison remembered the Reeperbahn and Grosse Freiheit as the best thing the group had ever seen, as it had so many neon lights, clubs and restaurants, although also saying, \\"The whole area was full of transvestites and prostitutes and gangsters, but I couldn't say that they were the audience ...The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:43:14) Harrison talking about Hamburg‚Äôs gangsters and hookers. Hamburg was really like our apprenticeship, learning how to play in front of people.\\" Best remembered the Indra as being a depressing place that was filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller, a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 Grosse Freiheit. After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise, the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller, starting on 4 October 1960. Performances Their playing schedule at the Kaiserkeller remained the same as it had been in the Indra. Lennon said: \\"We had to play for hours and hours on end. Every song lasted twenty minutes and had twenty solos in it. That's what improved the playing. There was nobody to copy from. We played what we liked best and the Germans liked it as long as it was loud.\\" The Beatles had been used to simply standing still when they had performed in Liverpool, but Koschmider would come to the front of the stage and loudly shout \\"Mach schau, mach schau!\\" (\\"make [a] show\\" or, more idiomatically, \\"put on a show\\" for the customers). Harrison explained that this prompted Lennon to \\"dance around like a gorilla, and we‚Äôd all knock our heads together.\\"The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:45:48) Harrison talking about \\"Mach schau\\". As Best had been the only one to take O-Level German at school, he could communicate with Koschmider and the clientele better than the rest of the group, and was invited to sing a speciality number called \\"Peppermint Twist\\" (while McCartney played the drums) but Best complained that he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage.Best and \\"Peppermint Twist\\" eskimo.com - Retrieved 26 November 2007 Willie Limpinski, Koschmider's business manager, decided that the club would attract more customers if it presented continuous live music. Williams warned the Beatles about the competition they would face by playing in the same club as the Hurricanes by saying, \\"You'd better pull your socks up because Rory Storm and the Hurricanes are coming in, and you know how good they are. They're going to knock you for six.\\" In early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day, alternating with the Beatles. They were appalled at the living conditions the Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and the Seniors (who were sleeping in one room at the back of the Kaiserkeller) had to put up with, so they booked into Hamburg's Seamens' Mission.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:42:17) Starr talking about living conditions. Violence and conflict The stage of the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood balanced on the top of beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who would be the first to break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment. Horst Fascher (born 1936, Hamburg) was Koschmider's nightclub bouncer, who had been the 1959 West German featherweight boxing champion, but his career was cut short after he unintentionally killed a sailor in a street fight. He later became a friend of the Beatles, and protected them from drunken customers. Lennon occasionally urinated out of his apartment‚Äôs window onto the street below, and often started arguments with the audience, so that eventually one member of the audience would jump on stage to hit him, but it was Fascher‚Äôs job to protect Lennon and the group. In some occasions beer bottles were thrown at them. Fascher remembered Lennon often greeting the audience with a \\"Heil Hitler\\", and a Nazi salute: \\"He'd pull out a black comb and pretend it was a moustache... people laughed.\\" Lennon was missing for a performance one evening, and Fascher found him in the toilet with a woman. He broke up the t√™te-√†-t√™te with a bucket of cold water which he threw over them both, and ordered Lennon onto the stage. Lennon was furious, and complained that he could not go on stage dripping wet. Fascher snapped back: \\"I don't give a shit, you're going onstage and I don't care if you do it naked.\\" A short time later the audience was roaring with laughter. Fascher ran to see what the commotion was, and saw Lennon playing guitar, but only wearing underpants with a toilet seat around his neck. (Epstein later asked Liverpool journalist Bill Harry not to publish photos showing Lennon walking along the Reeperbahn in his underpants). Fascher's brother, Fred, sang lead vocals with the group on \\"Be Bop A Lula\\", while he sang with them on \\"Hallelujah I Love Her So\\", and his alliance with the Beatles continued, as he later went to work at the Star- Club. Performance skills According to McCartney, Sutcliffe was a \\"typical art student\\", with bad skin and pimples, but his reputation grew after he began wearing tight trousers and dark Ray-Ban sunglasses. Sutcliffe's high spot was singing \\"Love Me Tender\\", which drew more applause than when the other Beatles sang, increasing the friction between himself and McCartney. Lennon also started to criticise Sutcliffe; making jokes about Sutcliffe's size and playing. While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles' biographies as appearing very uncomfortable onstage, and often playing with his back to the audience, Best denies this, recalling Sutcliffe as usually good-natured and \\"animated\\" before an audience.An Evening With Pete Best, Part I: The Interview rickresource.com - Retrieved: 20 January 2007 The Beatles steadily improved during their time in Hamburg, and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time. McCartney recalled, \\"We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us. The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would come in from the Top Ten (the big club where we aspired to go) or when Rory Storm or Ringo [Starr] would hang around to watch us. ‚ÄòWhat'd I Say‚Äô was always the one that really got them.\\" The song was often played by the group, once being played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning. Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying, \\"We have improved a thousand-fold since our arrival and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us.\\" On Saturday 15 October 1960, Williams arranged a recording session for Lou Walters (of the Hurricanes) at the Akustik Studio, a small booth on the fifth floor of 57 Kirchenallee (The Klockmann-House).Lou Walters' recording session Retrieved: 29 January 2007 Williams asked Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison to play and sing harmonies on the recording. Best was in town buying drumsticks, so Starr, the Hurricanes' drummer, played drums. This was the first time Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr recorded together. They recorded three songs: \\"Fever\\", \\"September Song\\" and \\"Summertime\\". =The Top Ten= The Reeperbahn Formerly the Hippodrome (Reeperbahn 136), the Top Ten club was opened in 1960 by Peter Eckhorn, and was operated by Iain Hines, who was an organist. In late October 1960, The Beatles left Koschmider's club to work at the Top Ten Club, as Eckhorn offered the group more money, a better PA (with reverb and echo) and a slightly better place to sleep (above the club itself) although by doing so the group broke their contract with Koschmider. Koschmider then reported Harrison for working under the legal age limit (even though he had been working at Koschmider's club) and Harrison was deported on 21 November 1960.(The Beatles Anthology) DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:49:56) Notice telling Harrison to leave Hamburg. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney and Best found a condom in their luggage, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set fire to it in order to have light to gather their possessions. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. McCartney: \\"One evening we were just walking down the Reeperbahn, when we heard this 'ta-ti-ti-ta', and then 'Komm mit mir!' ('Come with me!')\\". Best and McCartney spent three hours in the Davidwache Police Station, and were deported on 1 December 1960. Lennon's work permit was revoked a few days later and he went home by train, but as Sutcliffe had a cold, he stayed in Hamburg. Sutcliffe later borrowed money from Kirchherr (his German girlfriend) for the airfare back to Liverpool in early January 1961. Back in Liverpool, no one contacted each other for two weeks, but Best and his mother made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group's equipment. Back in Liverpool, the group played an engagement on 17 December 1960, at the Casbah Coffee Club, with Chas Newby substituting for Sutcliffe, playing bass with them for four shows.Photo of Chas Newby beatlesource.com - Retrieved 5 November 2007 Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing after the residency in Hamburg, and was struck by how powerful Best's drumming now was, pushing the group to play harder and louder. (It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to \\"Crank it up\\" = play as loud as possible). After Harrison turned 18 and the immigration problems had been solved, the Beatles went back to Hamburg for another residency at the Top Ten Club, playing from 27 March to 2 July 1961. To secure their return, Eckhorn paid DM 158 to the German authorities, which was the cost of deporting McCartney and Best back to Liverpool the previous winter. Fellow musician, Tony Sheridan, later remembered the living conditions at the club: ‚ÄúJohn, George, Paul, Stuart and Pete and I were booked to open the smart Top Ten in the Reeperbahn. We moved into a dormitory over the club and slept in bunks. It was terrible really, now I look back. We all washed our own shirts and socks so the place smelt like a Chinese laundry. But we had great times and I‚Äôm afraid we used to tease the life out of the old lady who [took care of] us.‚Äù Sutcliffe decided to leave the Beatles to concentrate on his art studies and to be with Kirchherr, so McCartney (unwillingly) took over as bass player for the group. Sutcliffe later enrolled at the Hamburg College of Art under the tutelage of the pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi. Sutcliffe lent McCartney his H√∂fner President 500/5 model bass guitar but asked McCartney not to change the strings around, so McCartney had to play it with the strings arranged backwards, until he could buy a specially made left-handed H√∂fner bass of his own.(The Beatles Anthology) DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:28:02) Harrison and McCartney talking about Sutcliffe‚Äôs first bass guitar.Sutcliffe's cheque book - liverpoolmuseums.org.uk - Retrieved: 13 May 2007Sutcliffe's President Bass rockmine.com - Retrieved: 9 May 2007 McCartney bought his first H√∂fner Violin bass guitar (model 500/1) from the Steinway-Haus Music Store (Colonnaden 29) for ¬£30 (equivalent to ¬£ in ); he couldn't afford a Fender since they cost around ¬£100 (equivalent to ¬£ in ).mccartney3 Lennon bought a 1958 Rickenbacker 325 Capri guitar prior to Sutcliffe's departure and Harrison bought a Gibson amplifier. The matching lilac jackets, made by McCartney's next-door neighbour in Liverpool to be worn as stage clothes, were soon threadbare, as were any other items of clothing, so the group bought cowboy boots, jeans and black leather jackets and trousers, from Paul Hundertmark's (Spielbudenplatz 9) and a tailor's shop at Thadenstrasse 6. Lennon said: \\"We had a bit more money the second time so we bought leather pants ... we looked like four Gene Vincents. =The Star-Club= Replicas of McCartney's H√∂fner bass and Harrison's Gretsch guitar leant against a Vox AC30 On 13 April 1962, the Beatles were booked as the opening act for the launch of a new club. The Star-Club, opened by Manfred Weissleder, had a capacity for two thousand people, as well as cinema-style seating. When the Beatles were booked to play there, Neil Aspinall left his job to become the Beatles' permanent road manager, as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an accountant, and had his van ferried to Hamburg.First meeting with George Harrison - Merseybeat triumphpc.com - Retrieved 11 February 2007photo of Aspinall‚Äôs van being loaded on the ferry to Hamburg beatlesource.com - Retrieved 4 November 2007 The Beatles returned to Hamburg by plane to play from 13 April to 31 May 1962. Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death. By the time of their second Star-Club visit from 1‚Äì14 November 1962, Starr had become the group's drummer. The Beatles stayed at the Hotel Germania (Detlev-Bremer- Strasse 8), having the luxury of single rooms for the first time, and then stayed at the Hotel Pacific (Neuer Pferdemarkt 30) for another booking from 18‚Äì31 December 1962. Harrison said: \\"We came back to play the Star-Club, a big place and fantastic because it had a great sound system. This time we had a hotel. I remember it was quite a long walk from the club, at the top of the Reeperbahn going back towards the city.\\" Portions of their final performances were taped with a portable recorder by an associate of Ted \\"King Size\\" Taylor of the Dominoes, another group playing at the club.

As the group had to play for hours, Sheridan offered them Preludin, saying: \\"Here's something to keep you awake.\\" Astrid Kirchherr also supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with Preludin, which when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until the early hours of the morning. Looking back, Harrison said that the whole group would be \\"frothing at the mouth\\" and would sometimes stay awake for days.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:44:29) Harrison talking about drugs in Hamburg.

McCartney said that he would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. Legitimate use of Preludin required a doctor's prescription, but Kirchherr's mother was able to obtain it from a local chemist who supplied the drug without asking questions. Epstein later asked the Star-Club owner, Weissleder, not to publish photographs showing the group playing with tubes of Preludin. Starr explained that Dexedrine too was in plentiful supply in Hamburg, as it was known to produce increased wakefulness and focus, in association with decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:44:06) Starr talking about drugs in Hamburg. Record release The first recording of the Beatles ever released was the single \\"My Bonnie\\", made in Hamburg with Tony Sheridan, who also had a residency at the Top Ten club. He recruited the band to act as his backing group on a series of recordings for the German Polydor Records label, the tracks produced by the bandleader Bert Kaempfert. On 22 June 1961, Sheridan and the Beatles drove to Hamburg-Harburg (about 30 minutes from Hamburg) to the Friedrich-Ebert-Halle (auditorium/hall) and were paid 330 Deutschmarks (about $75) for the recording. Kaempfert signed the group to a one-year Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. There were subsequent recording sessions on 23 June and in May 1962. On 31 October 1961, Polydor released \\"My Bonnie\\" (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur), appearing on the West German charts under the name \\"Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers\\"‚Äîa generic name used for whoever happened to be in Sheridan's backup group. McCartney later explained: \\"They didn't like our name and said, 'Change to the Beat Brothers, this is more understandable for the German audience.' We went along with it... it was a record.\\" The song was later released in the UK, on 5 January 1962.‚ÄúMy Bonnie‚Äú / ‚ÄúThe Saints‚Äú 23 April 1962. Polydor NH 66833 (Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers) A few copies were also pressed under the American Decca Records label.Palowski (1989), p.64 =Brian Epstein= \\"My Bonnie\\" was to bring the Beatles to the attention of a key figure in their subsequent development and commercial success, Brian Epstein. In September 1961, Harrison had a German copy of the record, which Sutcliffe had sent to him, as he was still in Hamburg. Harrison loaned it to Bob Wooler (The Cavern Club DJ) who played it at various venues, when the members of the group lent it to him. On 28 October 1961, the 27-year- old Epstein, manager of the record department in his father's NEMS music store in Whitechapel Street, Liverpool, was asked for the record by an 18-year-old boy, Raymond Jones (Epstein's record department sales manager subsequently stated in a 2000s TV documentary the name 'Raymond Jones' was made up by him as part of his standard practice of ordering in foreign records that NEMS would not have ordinarily ordered due to selling risks and supplier's minimum order quantity (25 units). He also stated upon receipt of the records from Germany he himself paid for the record under that name when it came in. Several teenagers had pestered him about the record and they kept coming back asking, and he got tired of having to tell them they didn't have it in stock, so he initiated the order himself). Epstein could find nothing on his files about the Beatles or the record, but the following day it was requested again by two girls, this time mentioning that the Beatles had been seen playing at the Cavern, a club in nearby Mathew Street. Alistair Taylor (Epstein's assistant) later said that the story had been invented and that he had used the name Jones to order copies of the record himself. Mersey Beat founder Bill Harry later repudiated the story about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were, as Harry had been talking to Epstein about the band for a long time (being the group he promoted the most in Mersey Beat) and by McCartney saying, \\"Brian [Epstein] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were, they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat.\\" Regardless, the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor, during lunch hour on 9 November 1961. He was initially repelled by the dark, damp club, but he congratulated them on their performance. Associates and social circle Astrid Kirchherr, Klaus Voormann, and J√ºrgen Vollmer were early fans of the Beatles after they heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was initially horrified at the idea of spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too. After having previously only listened to trad jazz, the Platters, and Nat King Cole, the Rock n' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them. The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: \\"It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them.\\" Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr, and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her when she had first walked into the club, and tried to talk to her during the next break, but she had already left. Kirchherr asked the Beatles if they would mind letting her take photographs of them in a photo session, which impressed them, as other groups only had snapshots that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in a fairground park called \\"Der Dom\\" which was close to the Reeperbahn.(The Beatles Anthology) DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:47:16) Harrison talking their friends Kircherr, Voormannn and Volmer. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, and they were engaged in November 1960. Kirchherr is credited with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut, although she personally disagrees. In 1995, she told BBC Radio Merseyside: \\"All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles' haircut, and my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart [Sutcliffe] liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [Best] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work.\\"Kirchherr's interview on BBC Radio Merseyside's 500th On the Beat programme, Saturday 26 August 1995.\\"Liverpool Days\\" book genesis- publications.com - Retrieved: 21 May 2007 After suffering blackouts and intense headaches, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital on 10 April 1962‚ÄîKirchherr rode with him in the ambulance‚Äîbut died before the ambulance reached the hospital.Lennon (2005) p110 Three days later Kirchherr met the Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them Sutcliffe had died of a brain haemorrhage. In 1966, Voormann was asked by Lennon to design the sleeve for the Beatles' album Revolver, and also played bass on solo recordings by Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr. In 1995, Voormann designed the artwork for the three-volume CD sets in The Beatles Anthology series. In 1999, Kirchherr published a book called Hamburg Days (a two-volume limited edition) containing a set of photographs by Kirchherr and \\"memory drawings\\" by Voormann of the Beatles time in Hamburg.Genesis books - Hamburg Days genesis- publications.com - Retrieved: 23 May 2007 Later years The Beatles returned to Hamburg in June 1966, staying at the Tremsb√ºttel castle (Schlosstrasse 10), and played two concerts in the Ernst-Merck-Halle on 26 and 27 June. Lennon later said, \\"I might have been born in Liverpool - but I grew up in Hamburg\\". Lennon posed in front of the door of J√§ger-Passage at Wohlwillstrasse 22 for a photograph which was later used on the covers of the Rock 'n' Roll and Rock 'n' Roll Sessions albums. The photo was taken by J√ºrgen Vollmer, during the time The Beatles were playing at the Top Ten club. The doorway of J√§ger- Passage, Wohlwillstrasse 22, as it looks today Individual Beatles later commented about their memories of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, \\"We'd outlived the Hamburg stage and wanted to pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [Epstein] made us go back to fulfill the contract\\". Harrison had positive memories of the period: \\"I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, but on the other hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame.\\" McCartney was philosophical: \\"Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records.\\" A memorial square, Beatles-Platz, was constructed in Hamburg in 2008 at the meeting of Reeperbahn and Gro√üe Freiheit streets, containing five stainless steel sculptures of the Beatles. Construction costs amounted to ‚Ç¨550,000 ($776,000), of which ‚Ç¨200,000 was provided by sponsors and donors. The idea of creating a memorial to the Beatles had been initiated in 2001 by Hamburg radio station Oldie 95. Hamburg's Mayor, Ole von Beust, said at the opening, \\"It is about time that Hamburg commemorated this great group.\\" The square when illuminated resembles a spinning turntable. Because the band members are shown only in outline form, the figure of the drummer can be either Best or Starr.

It is an east-west highway. In Mississippi, Airport Boulevard is known as Mississippi Highway 614. When it crosses the Alabama state line, its designation changes to Mobile County Highway 56 and its name changes to Airport Boulevard. Location Airport Boulevard is the most important east-west thoroughfare in the county which does not enter the downtown business district. Airport Boulevard is a two-lane highway from the Mississippi state line until it intersects with Snow Road in the western part of the county where it becomes a five-lane highway. It becomes a divided four-lane highway near the Mobile Regional Airport, territory which was annexed into the city in January 2008. Its first major intersection in the city limits is with Schillinger Road, a four-lane highway which has become a major shopping district over the years, which is what prompted the city to annex it around the same time as the airport. Airport continues as a four-lane highway until it reaches Cody Road (Mobile County Highway 37, the pre-2007 city limit in this area). Once it crosses Cody, Airport becomes a six-lane highway. Airport continues through Mobile, having major intersections at Hillcrest, University, McGregor/Azalea, Downtowner, Montlimar/Yester Oaks, Interstate 65, Bel Air, Sage and Florida. East of the Florida Street intersection, Airport reverts to a four-lane highway until it reaches Williams Street where it becomes a two-lane road (with a turn lane) before transitioning into a two-lane side street. The last two major intersections of Airport Boulevard are with Dauphin Island Parkway (for which Airport serves as the northern end) and the Government Street (U.S. Highway 90)/Houston Street intersection. Airport continues east of Government Street very briefly where it finally terminates at Old Government Street. Overview Airport Boulevard serves as both the heart of Mobile and a geographic boundary. West of the Government‚ÄìHouston intersection, the city of Mobile considers Airport to be the dividing line between the north and south sides, determining how the city allocates public services, such as garbage pickup. Airport is a semi-controlled access thoroughfare between Azalea and Sage; some turns which would hinder traffic are forbidden from Airport onto north-south intersecting roads, with the service roads being the required method of entry. Airport Boulevard serves as the north-south dividing line for Azalea Road and McGregor Boulevard. South of Airport the thoroughfare is a four-lane highway known as Azalea Road. North of Airport it is a two-lane neighborhood street known as McGregor Avenue, which traverses the upscale Spring Hill district. Airport also serves as the dividing line between Yester Oaks Drive, which becomes Montlimar south of the highway, and McGregor Drive. Montlimar is a wholly commercial thoroughfare, which is a four-lane highway with a turn lane. Yester Oaks is a residential street that passes through the Spring Hill district. Businesses Airport Boulevard is ringed with service roads, primarily east of Azalea Road, which remain a prominent feature of the thoroughfare until it reaches Sage Avenue. Mobile's major malls are located on Airport and the area around Airport and 65 was the premier shopping region until the development of the Schillinger Road area and the shopping centers in Baldwin County. In the last decade, the malls have seen many major stores leave. Airport is also home to Providence Catholic Hospital, which moved to its Airport location from a Midtown location in 1986. Airport Boulevard has one educational facility, located outside of the Mobile city limits. That facility is Baker High School. Airport is also close to Corpus Christi Catholic School, which is located on McKenna Drive, which is a spur of Hillcrest roughly a half mile north of Airport and which can also be reached by Hillview Road, which is a spur of Airport. Boundary line Upon entering the city limits, Airport briefly serves as the north-south boundary line between City Council Districts 6 and 7 (with 6 to the south and 7 to the north). Furthermore, it is split evenly between City Council District 6 and City Council District 5. The boundary line is University Boulevard, with District 6 to the west and District 5 to the east. District 5 is currently represented by Reggie Copeland, the city council president, who has served on the council since 1985.

SV Krishna Reddy launched the audiocassette and gave the first unit to Meher Ramesh. Reception and impact Sify.com gave a review stating \\"The film has been made well but it could have better scenes. Overall, since there are no other movies in sight now, Kick being a paisa vasool movie will definitely have a good run at the box office.\\" Indiaglitz.com gave a review stating \\"The film attempts to provide complete entertainment from start to end and except two scenes where there is a sentiment and melodrama, the rest of the movie runs mostly on comedy and action along with few thrills and twists. But then the movie could have been a lot better if the speed was worked upon and also the fights were not much in the movie which could have pushed in more adrenaline. Good mix of various elements, can be watched.\\" Sajid Nadiadwala intended to remake this film with A. R. Murugadoss as director.

It is the only genus the family Picobirnaviridae. Although amniotes, especially mammals, were thought to serve as hosts, it has been recently suggested that these viruses might infect bacteria and possibly some other invertebrates. There are currently three species in this genus including the type species human picobirnavirus. Associated symptoms include gastroenteritis in animals and humans, though the disease association is unclear. Etymology Picobirnavirus is a small (pico, Spanish for small), bisegmented (bi, Latin for two), double-stranded RNA virus. Picobirnaviruses were initially considered to be birna-like viruses, and the name was derived from birnavirus (bisegmented RNA), but the virions are much smaller (diameter 35 nm vs. 65 nm). Picobirnaviruses were first detected in humans and black-footed pigmy rice rats in 1988. Structure Viruses in the genus picobirnavirus are non- enveloped, with icosahedral geometries, and T=3 symmetry. The diameter is around 35‚Äì40 nm. Genome Genome arrangement of dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 of human picobirnavirus The genome is linear, bipartite, and composed of double- stranded RNA. It includes a segment 1 which is 2.2‚Äì2.7 kilobases (kb) in length and a segment 2 which is 1.2‚Äì1.9 kb in length. The genome codes for three to four proteins. The capsid protein gene is encoded by the second open reading frame of the larger genomic segment 1. Picobirnaviruses are divided into two genogroups on the basis of the sequence of segment 2. The RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is encoded by segment 2. The group viruses have been isolated from humans and other mammals, as well as birds and squamates.  Life cycle  RdRp replication (L) and transcription (R) in the viral capsid. Picobirnaviruses target intestine tissue. Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Once in the host cell, viral replication is cytoplasmic. Replication follows the double-stranded RNA virus replication model. Double-stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. The viruses are released from the cell by budding. Mammals serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are fecal-oral. Taxonomy Picobirnaviruses were initially thought to belong to the family Birnaviridae, but later were confirmed to differ with respect to host, virion size, capsid, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, genome size, and organization. The family Picobirnaviridae is now classified distinctly and composed of one genus Picobirnavirus, which has three species: *Beihai picobirnavirus *Equine picobirnavirus *Human picobirnavirus ReferencesExternal links  * Taxonomic proposal for picobirnaviridae at the ICTV * Viralzone: Picobirnavirus * ICTV Report: Picobirnaviridae Category:Double-stranded RNA viruses Category:Riboviria Category:Virus genera ","title":"Picobirnavirus"},{"id":"22786007","text":"Eden Ross Lipson (February 2, 1943 - May 12, 2009) was an editor at The New York Times, a scholar and children's books writer.

Overview  IMBeR research seeks to identify the natural mechanisms by which marine life influences marine biogeochemical cycles, and how these, in turn, influence marine ecosystems and how antropogenic activities are impacted and impacts on the oceans. In 2008, it engaged in the GLOBEC-IMBER Transition Task Team (TTT) , and upon TTT's recommendations, IMBER entered into its second phase at the end of 2009, aiming at to cover marine ecosystem research with associated latest technical and academic development. The GLOBEC research programme was to be finished by end 2008. Both GLOBEC and IMBER board members held meetings in the UK and the USA to confer the plan. Central to the IMBeR goal is the development of a predictive understanding of how marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems respond to complex forcing, such as large-scale climatic variations, changing physical dynamics, carbon cycle chemistry and nutrient fluxes, and the impacts of marine harvesting. Changes in marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems due to global change will also have consequences for the broader Earth System. An even greater challenge will be drawing together the natural and social science communities to study some of the key impacts and feedbacks between the marine and human systems.

Accessed on 27 Oct 10. () (2.5 hectares), also known as the Old Botanical Garden on the Fjord (Alter Botanischer Garten an der F√∂rde), is a former botanical garden and arboretum located at D√ºsternbrooker Weg 19, Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is open daily without charge. Kiel has had various botanical gardens since 1668, when professor Johann Daniel Major (1634‚Äì1693) established his horticus medicus within the garden of Kiel Castle. It is unclear whether this garden survived the Danish occupation of 1675-1676. Subsequent gardens were established on the site of the former Franciscan monastery on the Falckstra√üe (from 1727) and the garden at the Pr√ºne (from 1803). No trace of these early gardens remains. The Old Botanical Garden began as the private park of tobacco manufacturer Abraham Christian Brauer, who in 1825 created a garden with curved walkways, differentiated woody plantings, a swan pond, and excellent views of Kiel's fjord landscape. Upon his death in 1868 the site was acquired by the University of Kiel, and from 1878-1884 was refashioned by botanist Adolf Engler as a botanical garden, introducing geographic plantings of exotic species while preserving the landscape aesthetics. In 1891 the university added a hilltop pavilion, an octagonal brick building with a graceful dome of iron mesh, and in 1906 added the garden inspector's cottage. After the university created a new botanical garden on its campus in 1978 (the University Botanical Gardens), the garden became a public park in 1980. Its fence and pavilion were extensively restored from 1984‚Äì1994, and since 1998 the cottage has served as the Literature House of Schleswig-Holstein. Today the garden contains more than 280 species of diverse herbaceous flora, with an interesting collection of trees that includes one of the largest ginkgo trees in Schleswig-Holstein, two specimens of Metasequoia glyptostroboides said to be the oldest of their kind on the European mainland (planted circa 1948 from Arnold Arboretum seeds), and mature specimens of Amur cork tree, Juniperus rigida, Sequoia sempervirens, and Taxodium distichum. The garden also contains two ponds, lawn areas, and perennial flower beds.

The Madras Presidency is in the southeast, the Bombay Presidency is in the west and the Bengal Presidency is in the northeast. The candy or candee (Marathi: ‡§ñ‡§Ç‡§°‡•Ä, kha·πá·∏çƒ´;.. Tamil: ‡Æï‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø, k·πá·π≠i;. Malayalam: ka·πá·∏çi,. ka·πá·π≠i.), also known as the maunee, was a traditional South Asian unit of mass, equal to 20 maunds. and roughly equivalent to 500 pounds avoirdupois (227 kilograms).. It was most used in southern India, to the south of Akbar's empire, but has been recorded elsewhere in South Asia. In Marathi, the same word was also used for a unit of area of 120 bighas (25 hectares, very approximately), and it is also recorded as a unit of dry volume. The candy was generally one of the largest (if not the largest) unit in a given system of measurement. The name is thought to be derived from the Sanskrit ‡§ñ‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§® (root ‡§ñ‡•Å‡§°‡•ç) kha·πá·∏ç, \\"to divide, break into pieces\\", which has also been suggested as the root of the term (sugar-)candy. The word was adopted into several South Asian languages before the compilation of dictionaries, presumably through trade as several Dravidian languages have local synonyms: for example ‡∞ñ‡∞Ç‡∞°‡∞ø ka·πá·∏çi and ‡∞™‡±Å‡∞ü‡±ç‡∞ü‡∞ø pu·π≠·π≠i in Telugu..  Unit of mass  The candy was equal to twenty maunds, but the value of the maund was not standardised across South Asia. There were at least three different approximate values for maund in early nineteenth century India, ranging from 11.34 kg to 37.32 kg,Prinsep (1840), p. 77. and values from outside India varied even wider. Much of our knowledge of the values of South Asian mass units comes from an 1821 study ordered by the British East India Company and subsequently published as Kelly's Oriental Metrology,It seems unlikely that Kelly actually measured any standards for the candy, or even that such large physical standards even existed. However, it can be assumed that he accurately measured standards for the maund (or a similar mass unit). His results are quoted to a precision of 1 dram avoirdupois (). although the approximate value of 500 pounds for the candy is attested as early as 1618. The earliest European reference to the candy (1563) puts its mass at 522 arr√°teis (239.6 kg, 528.2 lbs.). The three Presidencies of British India had already undertaken a fair degree of standardisation of weights and measures by the time of Kelly's study.This process of standardisation was not complete until 1833 in the Bengal Presidency. In the Madras Presidency, the maund was fixed at 25 lbs. av. (11.340 kg),The Anglo-Hindoostanee Handbook (1850) gives the Madras maund as 25 troy pounds (9.331 kg), in contradiction with the values quoted in Prinsep (1840) that are far more complete and closer in time to the original British East India Company study of local weight standards (1821). It would seem unusual to have used troy weight for such large commercial quantities, so Prinsep's value has been retained here. making the candy equal to 500 lbs. av. (226.796 kg). In the Bombay Presidency, the maund was fixed at 28 lbs. av. (12.701 kg), making the candy exactly equal to 5 hundredweight (560 lbs. av., 254.012 kg). In Bombay itself (present-day Mumbai), a separate value of the candy was recorded for \\"grain\\", equal to 8 or 358 lbs. 6 oz. 4 dr.Prinsep (1840), pp. 84‚Äì90. (162.563 kg, see also below). In the Bengal Presidency, where the candy was not traditionally used, the maund (or mun) was a much larger unit, 100 troy poundsPrinsep (1840), p. 65.The use of an exact figure in troy weight for the Bengal Presidency stems from the definition of the local measurement system, based on the tola. The Bengal seer (1/80 of a Bengal maund) was exactly 72/35 pounds avoirdupois [Prinsep (1840), p. 65], so the Bengal maund was exactly 1152/7 lbs. av. (37.324 kg, equivalent to a candy of 746.5 kg). The effects of this standardisation can also be seen in other territories under direct British control. In Ceylon, the candy (also known as the bahar) was 500 lbs (226.796 kg) as on the Continent. Use of the candy is also recorded in British Burma, where it was the equivalent of 150 viss: its equivalent in Imperial units was measured as 500 lbs. (226.796 kg) in Pegu and 550 lbs. (249.476 kg) in Rangoon. Perhaps the most striking example is from the princely state of Travancore in southwest India. At the British East India Company trading station of Anjengo, (near modern-day Kadakkavoor.), the candy was equal to 35 telong and fixed at 560 lbs. (254.012 kg), as in Bombay. At Colachy (modern-day Kolachal) however, less than 50 miles (80 km) to the south, the candy was measured at only 376 lbs. 1 oz. 2 dr. (170.583 kg). File:Pope1880MadrasPres2.jpgMadras Presidency shown in an 1880 map. File:Pope1880BombayPres2.jpgBombay Presidency in an 1880 map. File:Pope1880BengalPres2.jpgBengal Presidency in 1880. In the region of the Central Provinces, the maund was roughly 40 lbs., which is probably about the value it had under the Mughal Empire.Depending on the method of calculation, the Mughal mun can be estimated as either 34¬æ lbs. av. or 47 lbs. av. [Prinsep (1840), p. 81]. The candy was not recorded as being in use as a unit of measurement in this region in 1821. Although not a part of the Central Provinces region, the unusually high value recorded for the candy in Baroda, Gujarat (modern-day Vadodara) ‚Äì 892 lbs. 1 oz. 4 dr. (404.640 kg) ‚Äì can be explained by this higher value of the Mughal maund. The candy in Surat, the main port of Gujerat, is also consistently quoted as being much larger than the same unit further south..  Unit of area  The candy (‡§ñ‡§Ç‡§°‡•Ä, kha·πá·∏çƒ´) is also recorded as a unit of area in Marathi, equal to 120 bighas. It is impossible to accurately convert this to modern units given the huge variability in the different values of the bigha in different locations. In particular, Kelly's 1821 study of South Asian metrology is completely silent on land measures in the Bombay Presidency. Molesworth defines the Marathi bigha (‡§¨‡§ø‡§ò‡§æ, bighƒÅ) as equal to twenty pandas (‡§™‡§æ‡§Ç‡§°, pƒÅ·πá·∏ça) or to 400 square (‡§ï‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä, kƒÅ·π≠hƒ´), but also notes that it varies in different districts.Molesworth (1857), p. 580. The same author defines the as \\"a land measure,‚Äîfive cubits and five handbreadths [‚Ä¶] also the measuring rod\\": Molesworth (1857), p. 151. other authors are silent on the unit.There is a Nepali unit of area called the kattha (‡§ï‡§†‡•ç‡§†‡§æ), approximately 338.57 m2: this is implausibly large for the Marathi , and there is no reason to assume that the two units are the same. A cubit is roughly equal to five handbreadths, so the can be taken to be roughly 25 square cubits: that is, 8100 square inches or 6.25 square yards. This would make the bigha roughly 2500 square yards, or half an acre, in agreement with measurements in other areas of India. The candy, therefore, can be taken to be approximately 60 acres or 25 hectares. The celebrated Scottish orientalist Sir Henry Yule gives a slightly larger value for the candy as a unit of area (\\"approximately 75 acres\\"), and describes it as the area of land which will produce one candy of grain. The Telegu unit of the putty (‡∞™‡±Å‡∞ü‡±ç‡∞ü‡∞ø, pu·π≠·π≠i) is also used in the same way: one putty of land is that area which will produce one putty of rice.  Unit of dry volume  Several sources also describe the candy as a unit of dry measure. Again, it is difficult to give an accurate conversion to modern units, as most sources quote conversions to mass units for specific goods,Prinsep (1840) goes as far as to assert that India had no true measures of dry volume, despite his description of the methods for determining the mass equivalent of dry measures (pp. 79‚Äì80). and the few specific conversion factors that exist range from 8 to 25 bushels. More plausible is that one candy of dry measure was the volume that would have been occupied by one candy (in mass) of water, that is about 254 litres (7 bushels) in Bombay (present-day Mumbai). *One candy of \\"grain\\" (unspecified) in Bombay was recorded by Kelly as 8 or 358 lbs. 6 oz. 4 dr. (162.563 kg), compared to a standard Bombay candy of 560 lbs. (254.012 kg), a factor of 0.640. This factor is lower than the relative density of modern hulled rice (0.753) but higher than that of rough rice (0.577).. *One for salt measure for Bombay was reported as 1607.6 cubic inches (26.344 litres), implying a candy for dry measure of salt as 210.8 litres: the factor (1.20, based on 254 litres for one candy of water) is identical to the relative density of caked salt. *The Ceylonese standard was a cube of sides 11.57 inches, that is 25.41 litres.. *Molesworth defines the Marathi (‡§™‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ, ) as 120 seers,Molesworth (1857), p. 280. implying a candy of 960 seers and a maund of 48 seers. The Bombay seer is given by Kelly as 11 oz. 3 dr. (317.2 g) for both grain and other commercial goods. Not all grain measures in candies should be taken as dry measures. The United Nations Statistical Office reported that the candy was in use in the 20th century:. *in east India for measuring rice, with a value of approximately 210.636 kg compared to the old Madras standard candy of 226.796 kg; *in Ceylon (later Sri Lanka) for measuring copra, with a value of 560 lbs. Both of these are obviously related to the candy as a unit of mass.

She led Essen Abbey from 1726 to 1776, the longest of any Essen abbess. Her tenure was marked by disputes between the Abbey and the city, which were caused by her counselors. She founded the Princess Francisca Christina Foundation, which still maintains the orphanage she founded in Essen-Steele. Her father was Theodore Eustace, Count Palatine of Sulzbach and her mother was Landgravine Maria Eleonore of Hesse-Rotenburg. Life Early life = Francisca Christina was born on 16 May 1696 as the daughter of Duke Theodore Eustace of Palatinate-Sulzbach and his wife Landgravine Maria Eleonore of Hesse-Rotenburg. She was the third child and second daughter. The Dukes Palatine of Sulzbach were a collateral branch of the Palatinate line of the House of Wittelsbach. At the age of five, she got a prebendary in the Thorn Abbey, a secular abbey for high-born ladies, west of the Meuse river, at Roermond. Her aunt Eleonore of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort was abbess of Thorn and made Francisca Christina, her \\"much-loved cousin\\", her sole heir in 1706. In 1712, she presented her (proof of her noble descent) to Essen Abbey. She received a prebendary there as well, subject to the condition that she was not allowed to vote on decisions of the Chapter as long as two of her sisters were also entitled to vote. The reason for this restriction was that only ten ladies were entitled to vote in the Chapter in Essen, and it was felt that giving the Palatinate-Sulzbach family three votes would give them too much influence. Nevertheless, Francisca Christina accepted her prebendary in Essen on 10 November 1712 and immediately took up residency in Essen, which was a condition for later being entitled to vote in the Chapter. She was released from the residency requirement in September 1713 and received the vote two years later, when her sister left Essen Abbey and joined a religious monastery. (Essen was a secular abbey; this meant that the collegiate ladies kept their own possessions and could leave whenever they wanted, for example, if they decided to marry). Francisca Christina did not hold any office neither in Thorn nor in Essen, before she was elected abbess. = Abbess in Thorn = Abbey of Thorn Abbess Juliana Anna Helena of Manderscheid-Blankenheim of Thorn Abbey died on 12 January 1717. On 31 March 1717, Francisca Christina was elected as her successor. At 21 years, she was not really old enough to hold this office, so she had to obtain a papal dispensation. She had not been the preferred candidate of the chapter, but outside influences had been decisive in her election. Five candidates had expressed interest in the office: * Anna Salome of Manderscheid-Kail-Falkenstein, wo was the Dean of Thorn, * the Countess of L√∂wenstein, a collegiate lady resident in Thorn, * Magdalena of Salm-Reiferscheid, another collegiate lady resident in Thorn, * Francisca Christina herself, who was also a collegiate lady, but not entitled to vote * Countess Anna Johannetta of Manderscheid-Blankenheim Ten collegiate ladies and six canons were entitled to vote. Thorn was an imperial abbey, so the abbess was an Imperial Princess. The election thus allowed royal houses to increase their influence, by having supporters of relatives elected. Already on 2 February 1717, a letter from Elector Palatine Charles III Philip arrived in Thorn, recommending the election of his relative Francisca Christina. Charles III Philip was a member of the Palatinate-Neuburg line of the House of Wittelsbach; his daughter Elisabeth Auguste married Francisca Christina's brother Joseph Charles (also in 1717) and seeing Francisca Christina elected would fit the power politics of the House of Wittelsbach. The chapter was initially opposed to this proposal, because Francisca Christina was less experienced than the other candidates. On 7 March, an envoy from the Elector arrived in Thorn, \\"... to make some proposals to the abbey's dignitaries with regards to the Serene Princess Christina of Sulzbach\\". The nature of these proposals is unknown, but they were so convincing that even a letter from Emperor Charles VI recommending another candidate, did not prevent the Wittelsbach candidate from being elected. = Abbess in Essen = On 15 October 1726 Francisca Christina was elected abbess in Essen. Her election in Essen was also significantly influenced by outside influences. K√ºppers- BraunFrauen des Hohen Adels, p. 155 ff has established that in this election the interests of several counts, in particular the Counts of Manderscheid- Blankenheim and the Count of Salm-Reifferscheid collided with the interests of the princely houses. The Dean of Essen, Anna Felicitas of Salm-Reifferscheid, played a pivotal r√¥le in this election. She had promised to vote for Francisca Christina, against the interests of her relatives. The Count of Manderscheid- Blankenheim offered the Count of Salm several prestigious benefices if the latter managed to persuade his sister to break that promise. Anna Felicitas, however, kept her promise and voted for Francisca Christina. Francisca Christina was the candidate favoured by the imperial princes. They, too, tried to influence the vote. The Archbishop of Cologne, Clemens August of Bavaria, who was a member of the Bavaria_Munich line of the House of Wittelsbach and with whom the Palatinate Sulzbach family had good contacts because Francisca Christina's brother had been a canon at Cologne, sent an envoy with a letter of recommendation. Elector Charles III Philip sent two envoys, with a letter of recommendation and instructions to stay in Essen until after the election. The kingdom of Prussia which regarded itself as the protector of the Protestant city of Essen, spoke out in favour of Francisca Christina. The Prussian envoy, however, felt hampered by the envoys of the Catholic principalities. Prussia relied on the promise that Francisca Christina would grant the Protestant city freedom of religion. The population of Essen was less credulous, because the general chapter of the abbey had to deal with a complaint by the Catholic councils, who demanded satisfaction for insults to their quarters. To ensure Francisca Christina's election, the Palatinate sent a cannon with crew into the city. With such massive support and also supported by a previously issued papal permission to exercise the office of abbess in two abbeys simultaneously, Francisca Christina was elected 20 votes from the 22 voters. = Princess-Abbess = Policies  During her election Francisca Christina had stayed in Sulzbach. When the newly elected abbess entered the city of Essen, a four-page brochure entitled Essendia Redeviva was published, in which it was alleged that during the reign of her predecessor Bernardine Sophia of East Frisia and Riedberg \\"nothing but hostility, distrust and disharmony had continually prevailed\\" and \\"the whole country had spent its days in melancholy, waiting in vain for redemption\\", until Francisca Christina took up office. K√ºppers-Braun points out that this brochure shows clear Jesuit influences.F√ºrst-√Ñbtissin, p.67 During Francisca Christina's reign of almost fifty years, Jesuits had considerable influence on the politics of the abbey. Her predecessor had fallen out with the order seven years earlier. Francisca Christina, however, brought them back as administrative experts. Her confessors, who exercised a strong influence on her, were Jesuits. The absolutist view on government of her advisors often clashed with the ancestral rights of the chapters of Thorn and Essen, which the latter fiercely defended. For example, there was a dispute over whether the abbess could decide the arrangement of prayers and processions alone, or did she need agreement with the chapter. Another dispute, which even led to a lawsuit before the Reichskammergericht in Wetzlar, was about whether the Abbess or her officialis had the right to inspect the fireplace in the private residences of the canons in Essen without prior consultation of the chapter. In Thorn, there were disputes over revenue and judicial issues. Under Francisca Christina's rather nominal government, a new tax code, a mortgage code and a court order were promulgated. The Estates, who had a say in tax issues, were called only once during her reign. After a while, they began meeting in the house of the Provost, without having been summoned by the Abbess. In fact she, or rather, her advisors, tried to prevent these meetings. The relationship between the Abbey and the City of Essen also suffered under the influence the Jesuits had on the abbess. Not only the Protestant citizens complained; the Catholics complained as well. In 1775, the collegiate ladies and the citizen together attempted to have Father Thomas Mantels SJ, Francisca Christina's Jesuit confessor, relieved of his religious leadership. Their motivation was that he had pursued the replacement of another Jesuit, who had been in charge of the St. John's parish. It was also alleged that he was responsible for the high tax burden and the unauthorized replacement of abbey officers. The witnesses all testified that Francisca Christina herself had done absolutely nothing wrong. One witness mentioned that things were alleged about her confessor which \\"no true Catholic could listen to without disgust\\". In about 1766, the papal Nuncio wrote this about Francisca Christina to his successor: \\"She is a pious Princess, full of faith, but she allows her confessor and her canons to celebrate one thousand abominations. Until recently, she had a Jesuit named Father Mantels, who ruled her with a stick, but he is now dead, and things are better.\\".The Nuncio wrote in Italian, this was translated by K√ºppers-Braun; see F√ºrst-√Ñbtissin, p. 72  Princely household  Borbeck Castle in the form that it received during Francisca Christina's reign Francisca Christina was the daughter of an imperial prince and, after her election, an imperial princess in her own right. As such, she tried to surround herself with a princely court, to the extent that her principality provided sufficient means to do so. Ignatius Fortuna occupied a prominent position at her court. In the abbey building in Essen, he lived in the anteroom of the dining hall. In the mansion in Steele, he had a heated room on the same floor as the princess, a privilege that only he and the treasurer of the congregation and the abbess's personal priest had. = Borbeck Castle = The arms of Countess Palatine Francisca Christina of Sulzbach above the entrance of Borbeck Castle The residence of the princes-abbesses of Essen in the Essen abbey buildings were old and in a poor condition. The Baron of Duminique, who later organized the election of Francisca Christina's successor in 1776 as an envoy of the Saxon court, found himself forced, due to the moisture in the masonry, to ask the Jesuits next door to provide him accommodation. Like many of her predecessors, Francisca Christina spent most of her time at Borbeck Castle. She extended and renovated the castle between 1744 and 1762, resulting in the castle's present form. She had the building extended on the south side by the court architect from the Palatinate court in D√ºsseldorf. She put her coat of arms above the entrance door and created a 42-acre castle garden in the English garden style. = The orphanage = The orphanage of the Princess Francisca Christina Foundation Francisca Christina's best-known deed was the foundation of her orphanage, which accepted its first children in 1769. The baroque buildings in Essen-Steele are now the only surviving secular buildings of Essen Abbey. Francisca Christina personally took part in furnishing the building and educating the orphans. All children were taught reading, writing and arithmetic. The boys also received a vocational training; the girls learned domestic and manual labour. They all received a handsome dowry when they left the institution. To secure the orphanage financially, she created the Princess Francisca Christina Foundation, which finances the orphanage to this day. There is some doubt, however, whether she has provided all of the Foundation's wealth out of her own resources. K√ºppers-BraunF√ºrst-√Ñbtissin, S. 73ff. has demonstrated that the purchase price of the farms that provide the economic basis of the foundation, must have greatly exceeded her financial resources. After deducting the cost of housekeeping and her funeral, the surplus from the sale of her entire estate was only 318 Reichstaler, less than the wealth her thrifty Moor Fortuna Ignatius left when he died. In fact, the orphanage served a triple function: apart from being an orphanage, it served as a residence for the abbess and above all, it served as a mission post of the Jesuits, who provided spiritual guidance to the foundation. The orphanage was constructed during a phase in which the Jesuits were criticized in many countries and even expelled from some, such as from Portugal in 1759. Presumable to avoid such criticism, the Princess Francisca Christina Foundation was designed as a secular foundation and its deeds and contracts were set up in a way that appealed to both the Jesuits and their critics. The chapel of the foundation has a special exemptionion: it was not part of any diocese, but subordinate directly to the pope. Any outside influence was barred. Pope Clement XIV suppressed the Jesuit order in 1773, four years after the orphanage was founded, but this had no effect on the orphanage. When in 1802 many religious institutions were secularized, the Princess Francisca Christina Foundation was again not affected, because it was a secular foundation.  Death and burial  Canopy over the coffin of the Abbess During the last years of her life, Francisca Christina was weak and frail and also plagued by diseases. However, she was not an easy patient: a report from 1775 complains that she did not regularly take her medications, ... although we three medical man, Leidenfrost, Bruning and Tuttman, adopt every possibility to provide her with tasty, and yet effective [Medicine].K√ºppers-Braun, F√ºrst-√Ñbtissin, p.78 The octogenarian abbess died on 16 July 1776 in Essen, shortly before her fifty- year jubilee. Her body was laid out in the audience hall of the abbey building under a magnificent canopy. On 18 July the coffin was transferred from Essen to Steele, which was still independent, on a hearse drawn by six horses covered in black. According to her last wishes, the princess was buried in the chapel of the orphanage she founded.

It is known as Government Boulevard west of Pinehill Drive, and as Government Street east of it. It is the most important road on Mobile's far south side and is the only nominally east‚Äìwest road on Mobile's south side to enter the city from outside the western city limits and reach the downtown business district. The only other two east‚Äìwest thoroughfares in the city to do so are Moffett Road/Springhill Avenue and Old Shell Road. Government Street is a four-lane highway throughout the city limits, from Water Street to the western city limits. It is the only thoroughfare in Mobile to have interchanges with both Interstate 10 (I-10) and I-65 within the city limits. Route description Government Street begins at the intersection with the Old Spanish Trail on Blakeley Island, east of where it emerges from the Bankhead Tunnel. It expands after crossing Royal Street. US 98 leaves the route at Broad Street, with the remainder of Government Street continuing as US 90\\\\. It continues onward for approximately to Pinehill Drive, where it becomes Government Boulevard. It then continues for approximately until it ends at the southwesternmost limits of the city, in Theodore. This area, along with the Tillmans Corner business district, was annexed into the city in September 2008. History Mobile Government Plaza, seat of government for the city of Mobile and Mobile County. Viewed from the corner of Government and South Jackson streets. The street was laid out and named after the close of Mobile's colonial era, following the demolition of the obsolete Fort Conde. In the early 1820s the marshlands between the Mobile River and Royal Street were filled in with the bricks and other material from the demolished fort. Government Street was run westward from the old esplanade that had been situated beside the river and fort. It has traditionally been a street where Mobile's government-related functions were concentrated. Barton Academy, Old City Hall, the Mobile County License Commissioner Offices, Mobile Government Plaza, the Mobile Public Library, Mobile Bar Association, and Social Security Administration all continue to lie along Government Street. Government had a reputation as the \\"mansion or millionaire's row\\" in the city, although many of the largest and grandest of the 19th-century mansions once lining the street were demolished as late as the 1980s. The area east of Houston Street still has many 19th- to early 20th-century mansions that date back to the time when Government was the most prestigious address that one could have in Mobile.

Using Visual Basic for Applications, C# or Java SDK for ArcGIS, it allows developers to extend these applications.http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/its/info/guides/93AMLGIS.pdf ArcObjects is a library of COM components that build up the foundation of the Esri's ArcGIS platform. ArcObjects is written mostly in the C++ programming language. All the ArcGIS for Desktop applications are based on ArcObjects. Since ArcGIS is completely built on top of ArcObjects, you can make use of COM services and capabilities to fully customize and extend the ArcGIS platform ‚Äîmeaning that extending the ArcObjects data model can be done easily and with virtually all COM-compatible programming languages (like Visual Basic, C#, Visual Basic.NET, Java and Python). COM enables components to be reused at a binary level. In other words, developers do not require access to the source code of ArcObjects in order to extend the ArcGIS platform. For this reason, an ArcObjects programmer can make use of any type inside the ArcObjects system without knowing the implementation details of the type. The developer only needs to know what the type is able to do. Because ArcObjects is based on the COM standard, you can easily work with it in conjunction with other COM objects and applications (many Windows-based software applications such as Microsoft Office are based on the COM standard). As previously mentioned, the ArcGIS platform was built using ArcObjects types (such as classes, interfaces, and enumerations). In the world of ArcObjects, classes use interfaces to organize properties and methods. Put simply, classes inside ArcObjects use only COM interfaces to expose their public members and communicate with each other. When working with an ArcObjects COM class, you never work with the properties and methods of the class; rather, you always access its properties and methods via one of its implemented interfaces. As an example, when you instantiate an object, you can only use one interface. However, after instantiation, you can query for any other interface that is implemented by that object. This process is sometimes called a Query Interface (QI). Classes in ArcObjects often have many interfaces.Beginning ArcGIS for Desktop Development using .NET, Pouria Amirian External links *Introduction to ArcObjects *Getting Started with ArcObjects  References  Category:Computer programming tools Category:Esri software Category:GIS software ","title":"ArcObjects"},{"id":"22786216","text":"Liopsetta is a genus of righteye flounders native to the northern oceans.

Archaeologist Richard S. MacNeish claimed that human occupation of the cave pre-dates by tens of thousands of years the Clovis Culture, traditionally believed to be one of the oldest if not the oldest culture in the Americas. Description Pendejo is a relatively small cave, only 5 meters wide, 12 meters deep, and having a maximum height of 3 meters. It is below the rim of an escarpment, facing north, and about above the canyon floor. The cave is located at an elevation of amidst the sparse desert vegetation of the Chihuahua Desert. A slightly more mesic habitat is found at the foot of the cliffs.\\"Pendejo Cave\\", https://www.utep.edu/leb/pleistnm/sites/pendejocave.htm, accessed 9 Mar 2017 Pendejo is a Spanish word and literally means \\"a pubic hair\\", but in Mexico it can also be a vulgar insult to someone's intelligence. Archaeological history Pendejo Cave was discovered in 1978, and twelve years later, in early 1990, the first archaeological expedition headed by MacNeish excavated the site. Another excavation occurred one year later, in late winter and early spring of 1991. Clovis (c. 11,000 BCE) tools were found in the cave, along with tools from later Native societies. Unifacial shavers, utilized flakes, and other artifacts were uncovered and attributed to various eras, along with several examples of worked bone, including a bone awl made from the scapula of a horse, and a knife made from a rib bone. MacNeish claimed to have found even earlier Native American artifacts in the cave. A total of 111 chipped tools was found throughout the formation in three complexes. He estimated the oldest may date back as far as 75,000 years. According to MacNeish, he found 3 pre- Clovis strata in the cave that he named, from oldest to youngest, the Orogrande, the McGregor, and the North Mesa. As of 2004, the early dating of the discoveries at Pendejo Cave has been discounted by many archaeologists. Faunal remains in the cave had been dated to possibly as old as 55,000 years, but the manufacture and dating of the chipped stones and other alleged artifacts of human origin was disputed.Fiedel, Stuart F.

The film shares its title but little else with the novel King of the Khyber Rifles (1916) by Talbot Mundy. This novel was also the basis for John Ford's The Black Watch (1929). The Khyber Pass scenes were shot in the Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, California. Released by 20th Century Fox, the film was one of the first shot in Technicolor CinemaScope. Plot synopsis In 1857, freshly-arrived Sandhurst-trained Captain Alan King (Tyrone Power), survives an attack on his escort to his North-West Frontier Province garrison near the Khyber Pass because of Ahmed, a native Afridi deserter from the Muslim fanatic rebel Karram Khan's (Guy Rolfe) forces. King was born locally and speaks Pashto. As soon as his fellow officers learn that his mother was a native Muslim (which got his parents disowned even by their own families), he falls prey to stubborn prejudiced discrimination. Lieutenant Geoffrey Heath (John Justin) even moves out of their quarters. Brigadier General J. R. Maitland (Michael Rennie), whose policy is full equality among whites, learns that King knew Karrum Khan as a boy and charges him with training and commanding the native cavalry. The general's daughter, Susan Maitland (Terry Moore), takes a fancy to Alan, even falls in love, but the general decides to send her home to England after a kidnap attempt which was foiled by King. King volunteers to engage Karram Khan, the only man who can bring the normally divided local tribes together in revolt, pretending to have deserted.

Born in a village in Agam, West Sumatra, she was taught at home by her father. After learning crafts before her marriage, she became interested in teaching such skills to women and providing for their overall education. She established a school in 1911, and in 1912 founded the newspaper, intended for women. She was its chief editor.  Early life  Roehana was born in village of Koto Gadang, Agam, the hinterland of West Sumatra. Her father Mohammad Rasjad Maharaja Soetan was an advisor to the Sultan of Deli. Roehana was a half-sister of Sutan Sjahrir and also a cousin of Agus Salim. Roehana was intelligent although she did not receive a formal education. She often studied with her father, who taught her in reading and language studies. When her father was assigned to Alahan Panjang, North Sumatra, she asked her Dutch neighbors to teach her household skills such as knitting and weaving.  Marriage and family  In 1908, when she was 24 years old, Roehana married Abdul Koeddoes, a notary public. Abdul Koeddoes was supportive of his wife's effort to educate women.  Creating a school  On February 11, 1911, Roehana Koeddoes decided to found a school for women, specifically to teach them crafts and skills beyond their ordinary household duties. During this time, she faced opposition from numerous sources who were resistant to change and advancement of women. With the support of her husband, Koeddoes persisted and eventually persuaded people to her side.http://www.langitperempuan.com/2008/07/rohana-kudus-rintis-suratkabar- perempuan-tahun-1912/ The school, named Sekolah Kerajinan Amai Setia, became a center for artisans to work with the Dutch government on sales of their work in major cities and overseas.

It is located within what is known as the Guite Kual. Most of the villages in this area are headed by a Chief of the Guite clan.  Political History  Suangdoh has always been under Guite rule. Among the Guites, the Suangdoh Chiefs are descendants of Thangpau, the third son of Inpipa Pu Vummang. Inpipa Pu Vummang is the 17th direct descendant of Pu Guite. From his capital city of choice, present-day Teddim, Pu Vummang ruled over 70 villages who paid him taxes.  Location  The village was originally located on a hilltop 30 or 40 kilometers from Singngat. To the east lies Singngat, to the southeast lies the famous Tuivel River and distant neighboring villages such as Mualzin, Tuiman, Maukot, C.Tuiveljang, Mongken, Doupau, Chiangpi, Tuilakjang, Lungthul (T), Enpum and Lungchin , and to the west lies the hill range of Lungthul. In the early 1990s, the then Chief Mr Khamchinpau Guite decided to move the village to a place originally known as Hiangtui, as the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Guite Road could not pass through Suangdoh as it was situated on a hilltop. Thus, the village is now situated about 5 km from its original location, on a low-lying flat top. This new Suangdoh is now roughly 35 kilometers from the nearest Tehsil, Singngat, 60 km from Churachandpur, and 89 km from Imphal. Today, the village has over 200 households, a PHSC/ Health & Wellness Centre, a Government High School and a Church-run Junior High School called Kaikhoen Academy. It is approximately 2 km long. Nearby villages include Tuiveljang, Maukot, Mongken, Doupau, Chiangpi, Tuilaakjang, Lungthul(T), Lungthul(E), Lungchin, etc. The rivers Tuivel, Tuilak, Tuivai, Zaupilui, Govomlui, and flows in and around Suangdoh. Tuiveljang, Tuilakjang, Doupau and Chiangpi were curved out of Suangdoh land, in other words, they are Machets.  People  The total population of Suangdoh at the 2001 census was 1337, with a male population of 663 and a female population of 674. Their main occupation has shifted from jhuming cultivation to other farming professions. Suangdoh is about 60 kilometers from Lamka and vehicles go to the village almost everyday.

Early days in India  Toubro began his career as a civil engineer. As an employee of F. L. Smidth & Co. of Copenhagen, he came to India in 1934 to erect and commission the equipment supplied to the Madukkarai Cement Works (near Coimbatore) and the Rohri Cement Factory (near the Sukkur Barrage in Sindh). Sometime after landing in India, he read a report in The Bombay Chronicle that quoted Mohandas K. Gandhi as saying: \\"(I am) not leading a movement to rid India of its white colonial masters in order to substitute them with brown ones.\\" Toubro felt that such an India would \\"offer great opportunities to anyone with modern technological and management skills.\\"  Larsen & Toubro  In 1938, Toubro partnered with his former schoolmate Henning Holck-Larsen, a chemical engineer and a fellow Smidth's employee, to establish Larsen & Toubro. The idea of L&T; was conceived during a holiday in Matheran, a hill station near Bombay (now Mumbai). Holck-Larsen was a risk- taker while Toubro was more conservative. Larsen & Toubro saw opportunities in India at a time, when few Europeans had realised the country's potential for industrial growth. The first office of L&T;, located in Bombay, was so small that only one of them could use it a time. Initially, L&T; represented Danish dairy equipment manufacturers. However, the Danish imports were restricted during World War II, forcing L&T; to start a small workshop that provided servicing and undertook small jobs. The imports stopped after the German invasion of Denmark, forcing L&T; to start manufacturing dairy equipment indigenously, a move that was successful. Seeing opportunity in ship repair during wartime, Larsen and Toubro formed a new company called Hilda Ltd. Around this time, L&T; also started two repair and fabrication shops. The internment of German engineers who were supposed to build a soda ash plant for the Tatas provided L&T; another new opportunity. In 1944, Larsen and Toubro established Engineering Construction & Contracts (ECC). L&T; started collaborating with international companies around this time. In 1945, L&T; signed an agreement with the Caterpillar Tractor Company of the United States for marketing earthmoving equipment. L&T; also started representing British manufacturers of equipment used to manufacture a variety of products including biscuits, glass, hydrogenated oils and soaps. At the end of World War II, the war-surplus Caterpillar equipment were available in bulk at low prices. However, L&T; lacked the money to purchase them. Therefore, Larsen and Toubro decided to raise additional equity capital, and as a result, Larsen & Toubro Private Limited was established on 7 February 1946. After India gained independence in 1947, L&T; set up offices in Calcutta, Madras, and New Delhi. In 1948, L&T; acquired of undeveloped land in the Powai suburb of Mumbai. Larsen and Toubro gradually transformed L&T; into a large business house with diverse interests. A 2006 article in The Hindu described Toubro as follows: Soren K. Toubro served as the director of L&T; from 1946 to 1981, and retired from active management in 1962‚Äì63. He continued to serve on the L&T; and ECC board of directors till 1981.  Last years  After spending nearly five decades in India, Toubro retired to Denmark in 1981, and died there the following year. Toubro had a large house and estate in Kodaikanal, where his wife spent her last days before her death. The Toubro Training Centre, located in the Manapakkam campus of L&T;'s ECC division, is named after him. The Toubro Construction Technology Centre, is also named after him, and was inaugurated by his son Ole K. Toubro in 2006.

The parameters are: (a) RaT = 7√ó108 , t=1.12√ó10‚àí2, (b) RaT =3.5√ó108, t=1.12√ó10‚àí2, (c) RaT =7√ó106, t=1.31√ó10‚àí2, (d) RaT=7√ó105, t=3.69√ó10‚àí2. It is seen from the figure that finger characteristics such as width, evolution pattern are a function of Rayleigh numbers. Double diffusive convection is a fluid dynamics phenomenon that describes a form of convection driven by two different density gradients, which have different rates of diffusion. Convection in fluids is driven by density variations within them under the influence of gravity. These density variations may be caused by gradients in the composition of the fluid, or by differences in temperature (through thermal expansion). Thermal and compositional gradients can often diffuse with time, reducing their ability to drive the convection, and requiring that gradients in other regions of the flow exist in order for convection to continue. A common example of double diffusive convection is in oceanography, where heat and salt concentrations exist with different gradients and diffuse at differing rates. An effect that affects both of these variables is the input of cold freshwater from an iceberg. Double diffusive convection is important in understanding the evolution of a number of systems that have multiple causes for density variations. These include convection in the Earth's oceans (as mentioned above), in magma chambers, and in the sun (where heat and helium diffuse at differing rates). Sediment can also be thought as having a slow Brownian diffusion rate compared to salt or heat, so double diffusive convection is thought to be important below sediment laden rivers in lakes and the ocean. Two quite different types of fluid motion exist‚Äîand therefore are classified accordingly‚Äîdepending on whether the stable stratification is provided by the density-affecting component with the lowest or the highest molecular diffusivity. If the stratification is provided by the component with the lower molecular diffusivity (for example in case of a stable salt-stratified ocean perturbed by a thermal gradient due to an iceberg‚Äîa density ratio between 0 and 1), the stratification is called to be of \\"diffusive\\" type (see external link below), otherwise it is of \\"finger\\" type, occurring frequently in oceanographic studies as salt-fingers. These long fingers of rising and sinking water occur when hot saline water lies over cold fresh water of a higher density. A perturbation to the surface of hot salty water results in an element of hot salty water surrounded by cold fresh water. This element loses its heat more rapidly than its salinity because the diffusion of heat is faster than of salt; this is analogous to the way in which just unstirred coffee goes cold before the sugar has diffused to the top. Because the water becomes cooler but remains salty, it becomes denser than the fluid layer beneath it. This makes the perturbation grow and causes the downward extension of a salt finger. As this finger grows, additional thermal diffusion accelerates this effect. Role of salt fingers in oceans Double diffusion convection plays a significant role in upwelling of nutrients and vertical transport of heat and salt in oceans. Salt fingering contributes to vertical mixing in the oceans. Such mixing helps regulate the gradual overturning circulation of the ocean, which control the climate of the earth. Apart from playing an important role in controlling the climate, fingers are responsible for upwelling of nutrients which supports flora and fauna. The most significant aspect of finger convection is that they transport the fluxes of heat and salt vertically, which has been studied extensively during the last five decades. Governing Equations  The conservation equations for vertical momentum, heat and salinity equations (under Boussinesq‚Äôs approximation) have following form for double diffusive salt fingers: :: { abla}\\\\cdot U =0 :: \\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial t} + U\\\\cdot abla U = u { abla}^2 U - g(\\\\beta \\\\Delta S-\\\\alpha \\\\Delta T)\\\\mathbf{k} :: \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} + U\\\\cdot abla T = k_T { abla}^2 T :: \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t} + U\\\\cdot abla S = k_S { abla}^2 S Where, U and W are velocity components in horizontal (x axis) and vertical (z axis) direction; k is the unit vector in the Z-direction, kT is molecular diffusivity of heat, kS is molecular diffusivity of salt, Œ± is coefficient of thermal expansion at constant pressure and salinity and Œ≤ is the coefficient of saline expansion at constant pressure and temperature. The above set of conservation equations governing the two-dimensional finger-convection system is non-dimensionalised using the following scaling: the depth of the total layer height H is chosen as the characteristic length, velocity (U, W), salinity (S), temperature (T) and time (t) are non-dimensionalised as :: x=\\\\frac{X}{H} , z=\\\\frac{Z}{H}, u=\\\\frac{U}{k_T /H}, w= \\\\frac{W}{k_T /H}, S^*= \\\\frac{S-S_B}{S_T-S_B} , T^*= \\\\frac{T-T_B}{T_T-T_B}, t^* = \\\\frac{t}{H^2 /k_T }. Where, (TT, ST) and (TB, SB) are the temperature and concentration of the top and bottom layers respectively. On introducing the above non-dimensional variables, the above governing equations reduce to the following form: :: { abla}\\\\cdot u =0 :: \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t^*} + u\\\\cdot abla u = Pr { abla}^2 u - \\\\left[Pr Ra_T (\\\\frac{S^*}{R_\\\\rho}-T^*)\\\\right] \\\\mathbf{k} :: \\\\frac{\\\\partial T^*}{\\\\partial t^*} + u\\\\cdot\\\\Delta T^* = { abla}^2 T^* :: \\\\frac{\\\\partial S^*}{\\\\partial t^*} + u\\\\cdot\\\\Delta S^* = \\\\frac{Pr}{Sc} { abla}^2 S^* Where, RœÅ is the density stability ratio, RaT is the thermal Rayleigh number, Pr is the Prandtl number, Sc is the Schmidt number which are defined as :: R_\\\\rho = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha \\\\Delta T }{\\\\beta \\\\Delta S}, Ra_T = \\\\frac{g\\\\alpha \\\\Delta T H^3}{ u k_T}, Pr=\\\\frac{ u}{k_T}, Sc=\\\\frac{ u}{k_S} . Figure 1(a-d) shows the evolution of salt fingers in heat-salt system for different Rayleigh numbers at a fixed RœÅ. It can be noticed that thin and thick fingers form at different RaT. Fingers flux ratio, growth rate, kinetic energy, evolution pattern, finger width etc. are found to be the function of Rayleigh numbers and RœÅ.Where, flux ratio is another important non-dimensional parameter. It is the ratio of heat and salinity fluxes, defined as, :: R_f=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha T'}{\\\\beta S'}. Applications Double diffusive convection holds importance in natural processes and engineering applications. The effect of double diffusive convection is not limited to oceanography, also occurring in geology, astrophysics, and metallurgy.

He is also known for being Comiket's co-founder and president. He died of lung cancer at 53. He won the 2007 Seiun Award in the special category and 2010 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize Special Award. Biography Born in Kumamoto, Japan, on March 21, 1953, Yoshihiro Yonezawa began drawing parodies of his favourite manga characters when he was a child. In 1969, Yonezawa joined the staff of Kyukon at age 16. He began criticising manga while he was studying engineering at Meiji University, as part of the group Meikyu.http://www.meiji.ac.jp/manga/english/yonezawa_lib/profile/ Yonezawa has said that in the early 1970s, mostly mainstream manga were published, as there were few manga magazines at that time. COM, a manga magazine with a reputation for publishing experimental manga had closed in 1972, and Yonezawa believed that by 1973 and 1974, it was very difficult to publish \\"unusual\\" works in anything other than \\"underground\\" zines devoted to d≈çjinshi. To explore the potential of the medium, he co-founded Comiket (The Comic Market) in 1975 with Harada Teruo (chairman) and Aniwa Jun, who were university students. Comiket is a bi-annual, 3-day event where d≈çjinshi manga is brought and traded. Yonezawa's publication of The History of Post War Manga Trilogy in 1980 showed his devotion to reviewing and chronicling manga. He was a judge for the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. In 1999, he received the 21st Japan Society of Publishing Studies Award for Bessatsu Taiyo: Hakkinbon. Since 1999, he regularly reviewed manga on his column, \\"Yoshihiro Yonezawa's Commentary on Contemporary \\", in Media Factory's Monthly Comic Flapper until October 2006. He was posthumously awarded the 2007 Seiun Award in the special category, and the special Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2010. He was hospitalised on September 30, 2006, and on October 1, 2006, Yonezawa died of lung cancer at age 53. On the last day of Comiket 71 which was held from December 29 to 31, 2006, as announced in the event's catalogue, a thirty seconds of silence was held on 15:59 just before the announcement of closing.

Accessed May 13, 2009. It originates in the Selwyn Mountains, which stand on the border between the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory. From there, the Stewart flows west, past the village of Mayo. The river is crossed by the Klondike Highway at the village of Stewart Crossing, and the highway parallels the river westward for about . After leaving the highway, the river travels southwest until it intersects the Yukon River south of Dawson City. The mostly abandoned village of Stewart River is located at the mouth of the river. The Stewart River was explored by Robert Campbell of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1850. He named the river after a close friend and assistant in the company, James Green Stewart. Stewart was instrumental in helping Campbell build and supply Fort Selkirk at the junction of the Pelly and Yukon rivers.Webb, Melody. Yukon: The Last Frontier UBC Press, 1993. p. 39. It lay undeveloped until the Klondike Gold Rush opened the area to prospecting and mining. Because the Stewart River was located away from the Klondike River and the best-known gold fields, it did not receive as much attention from big mining companies. Individual miners and smaller companies explored gold prospects along the river, and in 1914, a large silver lode was found on a tributary of the Stewart. This spurred mining, and in 1918, an even bigger silver source was found at the present-day site of Keno City.Parks Canada. \\"S.S. Klondike National Historic Site of Canada\\", Pc.gc.ca. November 28, 2008. Accessed May 13, 2009. Mining operations increased and, by 1923, the value of silver mined from the Stewart River area surpassed that of the gold taken from the Klondike. Because the Stewart is shallower than the Yukon River, ordinary steamboats could not be used on the river. Special models had to be built, and these operated on the Stewart River until they were replaced by a road network after World War II. The S.S. Keno, a Stewart River steamer, has been preserved as a Canadian historic monument in Dawson City.Parks Canada. \\"S.S. Keno National Historic Site of Canada\\", Pc.gc.ca. November 28, 2008.

VII, c.8) - the People's Budget - in response to the unequal ownership of land in the early 20th century. The tax was based on the increase in value of property due to public expenditure on roads, drainage, building of parks etc., described as unearned increment. The tax was based on the difference between the amount of two valuations. Section 26(1) of the Act required the Board of Inland Revenue to ascertain the site value of all land in the United Kingdom as on 30 April 1909. This value constituted the \\"datum line\\" for the purposes of increment value duty. Any subsequent sale or grant of a lease, or transfer of an interest in a piece of land, or the subsequent death of a land-owner, provided the occasion for a potential payment of increment value duty; the site value at that date had then to be determined. It was repealed by the Finance Act 1920. A valuable offshoot of this tax and the Act was the 1910-15 Valuation Office maps and field books Resulting from this, The Valuation Office was set up to assess and record the value of each property. The result was a nationwide survey of all workshops, houses, farms etc., which recorded details such as the owner, occupier, value and the number of rooms of each property. The surveyors used Ordnance Survey maps to identify each property and then enter the detailed information into 'Field Books'. These records are useful for exploring land values, land ownership and land occupancy.

This long stretch of time is divided into Old Gan, late Old Gan, and Middle Gan periods. Old Gan Old Gan (, Song-gu Gon-ngi) or Proto-Gan (ÂéüÂßãË¥õË™û, Ngien-si Gon-ngi) was spoken between the beginning of the Qin dynasty to the latter part of the Han dynasty.Wan Bo (Ëê¨Ê≥¢), Research on Gan's consonants (Ë¥õË™ûËÅ≤ÊØçÁöÑÊ≠∑Âè≤Â±§Ê¨°Á†îÁ©∂). In the year of 221 BC, General Tu Sui () was sent on behalf of the Qin dynasty to the south of China in order to conquer the territory of Baiyue. 500,000 soldiers then settled down at Yugan, Nankang and three other places. This formed the initial Chinese population in Jiangxi. In 202 BC, Yuzhang Prefecture () was set up by the Han dynasty. Following this, the local population increased rapidly. Late Old Gan Late Old Gan (‰∏≠Âè§Ë¥õË™û, Zung-gu Gon-ngi) was spoken between the 3rd and 6th centuries. It was largely sinicized by new settlers from the Central Plain. Some scholars consider late Old Gan, together with Hakka Chinese and the Tongtai dialect of Jianghuai Mandarin to have been the lingua franca of the Southern Dynasties.Lu Guoyao (È≠ØÂúãÂ†Ø), On Gan-Hakka and the Tongtai dialect derived from lingua franca of Southern Dynasties (ÂÆ¢„ÄÅË¥õ„ÄÅÈÄöÊ≥∞ÊñπË®ÄÊ∫êÊñºÂçóÊúùÈÄöË™ûË™™), 2003, , pages 123-135 However, late Old Gan was still distinctly different from the official language. History of Southern Dynasties records that Middle Gan Middle Gan (‰∏≠‰∏ñË¥õË™û, Zung-si Gon-ngi) is the variety of Gan spoken between the Tang and Song dynasties (from the 6th to the 13th century). The last time of large-scale settlement in Jiangxi by people from the Central Plain took place as a result of the An Lushan Rebellion. Gan also became stabilized following this period. Research on the rhyming system of Jiangxi poets of this period has been made in order to reconstruct the linguistic form of Middle Gan. Scholars have found that modern Gan still keeps many linguistic characteristics of this historical layer.Du Aiying (ÊùúÊÑõËã±), On the rhyming system of Jiangxi poets of Song dynasty (ÂÆã‰ª£Ê±üË•øË©©‰∫∫Áî®ÈüªÁ†îÁ©∂)Liu Lunxin (ÂäâÁ∂∏Èë´), On the history of Gan-Hakka (ÂÆ¢Ë¥õÊñπË®ÄÂè≤Á∞°Ë´ñ) For example, *rime Â∞§‰æØ corresponds to rime Ëï≠Ë±™; *rime ÊîØÂæÆ corresponds to rime È≠öÊ®°; *rime È≠öÊ®° corresponds to rime ÂÆ∂È∫ª; *rime ÁöÜ‰æÜ corresponds to rime ÊîØÂæÆ; *rime Áõ£Âªâ corresponds to rime ÂØíÂÖà; *rime Â∫öÈùí corresponds to rime Ê±üÈôΩ. Late Middle Gan Late Middle Gan (Ëøë‰∏ñË¥õË™û, Qin-si Gon- ngi) was the form of Gan spoken between the Yuan and Ming dynasties (from the 13th to the 17th century). Some linguistic characteristics of late Middle Gan are:DING Bangxin, 1987Furuya Akihiro , 1992 *Semi-coronal differentiates from alveolar stops *Muddy consonants are merged with aspirated consonants *Syllable coda merges into Early Modern Gan Early Modern Gan (Ëøë‰ª£Ë¥õË™û, Qin- tai Gon-ngi) was the form of Gan spoken from the Qing dynasty (17th century) up to the beginning of modern times. The textbook Lei Zi Meng Qiu () published in the middle of the 19th century has been used to understand the linguistic form of Nanchang dialect; scholars have found that Gan has stayed relatively stable from this time. For example, the nasal ending merged into , and 7 tones were used. Westerners also began to study Gan during this period. British diplomatic official Edward Harper Parker was the first westerner to recorded Gan speech. He noticed his friend Wen-yuan of Fuzhou merged muddy consonants with aspirate consonants. Bibles in some Gan dialects were also published at this time.

It has a population of about 3,600. Velk√© Opatovice is situated about 260 km southeast of Prague and 120 km north of Vienna. Administrative parts Villages Bezƒèeƒç√≠, Br≈•ov, Korbelova Lhota, Sv√°rov and Velk√° Roudka are administrative parts of Velk√© Opatovice. History The first evidence of the settlement dates to 1308, when a contract shows the purchase of a town called Opatovice by the nearby Cimburk castle, today a ruin. The 'Velk√©' part of the name (meaning \\"great\\") was added in 1888, and the town became a town in 1969. The most significant estates in Velk√© Opatovice are those of the Vƒõzn√≠k, Salm, and Herber≈°tein families. Economy Residents are self-employed or work in small businesses including the local butchers, florists, sweetshop, and construction company. SightsCastle= The town's baroque castle dates to 1757. It belonged to the Salm family, and passed to the Herbersteins in the late 18th century. The Herbersteins added the castle's neobaroque tower. The castle passed to municipal control after 1945, and it was damaged by a fire that destroyed one block in 1978. The castle now serves as the town museum, with a memorial hall devoted to academic sculptor Carl Ot√°hal who lived in Velk√© Opatovice for 30 years. In 2007, the burnt part of the building was replaced with an elliptical auditorium. The castles grounds include beautiful parkland containing plant and animal species and a statue of Bed≈ôich Smetana. =Church of St. George= The town's major church is of interest for its baroque decoration and altar relief of St. George fighting the dragon. The church was built in the late 18th century on the site of a 14th-century Gothic temple. =Cartographic centre= The centre hosts a permanent exhibition on the historical development of cartography. Subjects include the philosophy entailed in imagery of the Earth's surface on maps, and the history of the production of maps. The main auditorium displays a giant relief-map of historical Moravia and Silesia. =Opatovice fortified settlement= 1.5 km south of the town stand the remnants of a 513m tall Bronze Age building. In the rockface below the sculptor Karel Ot√°hal inscribed relief texts by the poet Petr Bezruƒç and the composer J.B. Foerst. =Nature= At nearby Velk√° Roudka is the Franti≈°ek's spring, which produces drinkable water, and the remainder of an abandoned spa founded in 1839. Near the village of Sv√°rov is a rock formation called the \\"stone wedding.\\" Local legend holds that the standing stones there are petrified guests from a wedding, cursed by the chef who was making the wedding dinner and was angry that they were late. Transport Public transport is provided by buses. Culture The town is served by several restaurants and pubs. Also within the castle grounds is the town cinema. A community centre in the centre of the town hosts balls, meetings, tourism events, and dances. As well as the town museum located in the castle, Velk√© Opatovice has a gallery devoted to sculptor Karel Ot√°hal, the creator of a lifesize statue of Smetana located in the castle grounds.

He founded a Church of Scotland in Middelburg in the Netherlands. He was born about 1568, and was third son of William Forbes of Corse and Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Strachan of Thornton. He graduated M.A. at St Andrews in 1583, and was settled in Alford in 1593. In November 1602 the General Assembly chose him as one of those whom the King might select for nominating commissioners from the various Presbyteries to Parliament. At Alford he came into conflict with the powerful sept of the Gordons, who were vigorous opponents of Protestantism, and when the Synods of Aberdeen and Moray excommunicated the Marquess of Huntly, and Huntly had appealed successfully to the Privy Council, Forbes was sent by these Synods to London to represent the case to King James. He was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of Aberdeen on 2 July 1605 contrary to the King's order. Of twelve Aberdeenshire ministers who were present ten afterwards admitted the illegal nature of the Assembly, but Forbes [and Charles Fearn, minister of Fraserburgh] having been summoned before the Privy Council, declined the Council's jurisdiction, on the ground that the Assembly had dealt wholly with spiritual matters. For this he was imprisoned at Blackness, tried for high treason, and banished the country. On 7 November 1616 he sailed from Leith for Bordeaux, and after spending a time with Boyd of Trochrig at Saumur, he proceeded to Sedan. Much of his work thereafter consisted in visiting the Reformed Churches and Universities on the Continent, in which were many Scots students and professors. In 1611 he became minister of the English congregation at Middelburg, Holland, and soon after he was offered release from his sentence, but upon conditions he could not accept. In 1616 he came to London, where he had an interview with the King, who promised to annul his banishment ‚Äî a promise which was not fulfilled. In 1621 he was minister at Delft, but the hatred of his former ministerial brethren, some of whom were now bishops, instigated Laud and the English Government to procure his dismissal, and this was carried out in 1628. He died in Holland in 1634. Life Middelburg in 1652. Forbes founded an English speaking church here. John Forbes was born around 1568, probably at his father's main residence, Corse Castle, and was educated at the University of St. Andrews, where he earned the degree of M.A. in 1583, and was ordained minister of Alford, Aberdeenshire in 1593. When the proceedings of the synods of Aberdeen and Moray against George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly were interfered with by the privy council, he was sent by them to London to seek redress from the king, James I. He went to court in March 1605, was graciously received by the king, and succeeded in the object of his mission. In July 1605 he was appointed moderator of the Aberdeen assembly, which was held contrary to the king's orders; and when he and others were summoned before the privy council to answer for their disobedience, they declined its jurisdiction, as the matter was spiritual, and offered to submit their conduct to the judgment of the church. For this Forbes and five others were imprisoned in Blackness Castle (the so-called \\"warded minsters\\", who included also John Welsh of Ayr, and other participants in the assembly, namely Andrew Duncan, Robert Dury, John Sharp, and Alexander Strachan.).http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/melville_james1.htmhttp://www.ssnr.nl/site/geef- voltekst.php?voltekst_id=B00001645, at pp. 30-1 of the PDF, in Dutch. They were tried for high treason, found guilty by a packed jury, and banished from the king's dominions for life. The exiles sailed from Leith for Bordeaux on 7 November 1606. On reaching France Forbes visited James Boyd of Trochrig at Saumur Academy, and then went to the Academy of Sedan. For some years he travelled, visiting the reformed churches and universities. In 1611 he was settled as pastor of a British congregation at Middelburg. He was offered release from banishment on conditions which he could not accept. In 1616 he was in London for several months, and saw the king, who promised to revoke his sentence of exile, but the promise was not fulfilled. After a ministry of ten years at Middelburg, he became pastor of the British church at Delft. In 1628 Charles I of England, influenced by William Laud, began to interfere with the worship and discipline of the English and Scottish churches in the Netherlands, and Forbes was ultimately removed from his charge. He died in 1634, aged about sixty-six.

Composition The symbolic meaning of the shield is - to protect, defend, provide sanctuary and it is the foundation of the seal. In its upper part the shield ends in a castle wall, which emphasizes the important administrative, military, political and economical importance of Stara Zagora for the hundreds of years of its growth and development. In its central part on a red background, there is a mother and baby lion. This particular picture has been taken from a rock carving from the 12th century found in Stara Zagora in 1949 and has become one of the city symbols. The lioness represents the mother instinct, fertility and is placed in the central part of the Coat of Arms, which has not only historical, but symbolic meaning, to show that despite what the city has been through in the past thousands of year it still continues its existence and continues its progress. The bottom has green background with golden-yellow stripes which converge towards the center. This enhances the fertility of the Stara Zagora fields and is a symbol of roads to the future. The green color is a symbol of life and death and the hope and happiness. The red color, used for the central part, is a symbol of fire, health, strength and love.

Deza graduated from Moscow University in 1961, after which he worked at the Soviet Academy of Sciences until emigrating to France in 1972. In France, he worked at CNRS from 1973 until his 2005 retirement. He has written eight books and about 280 academic papers with 75 different co-authors, including four papers with Paul Erd≈ës, giving him an Erd≈ës number of 1.Erdos0d, Version 2007, September 3, 2008, from the Erd≈ës number project. The papers from a conference on combinatorics, geometry and computer science, held in Luminy, France in May 2007, have been collected as a special issue of the European Journal of Combinatorics in honor of Deza's 70th birthday. Selected papers *. This paper solved a conjecture of Paul Erd≈ës and L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz (in , p. 406) that a sufficiently large family of k-subsets of any n-element universe, in which the intersection of every pair of k-subsets has exactly t elements, has a common t-element set shared by all the members of the family. Manoussakis writes that Deza is sorry not to have kept and framed the US$100 check from Erd≈ës for the prize for solving the problem, and that this result inspired Deza to pursue a lifestyle of mathematics and travel similar to that of Erd≈ës. *. This paper considers functions ∆í from subsets of some n-element universe to integers, with the property that, when A is a small set, the sum of the function values of the supersets of A is zero. The strength of the function is the maximum value t such that all sets A of t or fewer elements have this property. If a family of sets F has the property that it contains all the sets that have nonzero values for some function ∆í of strength at most t, F is t-dependent; the t-dependent families form the dependent sets of a matroid, which Deza and his co-authors investigate. *. This paper in polyhedral combinatorics describes some of the facets of a polytope that encodes cuts in a complete graph. As the maximum cut problem is NP-complete, but could be solved by linear programming given a complete description of this polytope's facets, such a complete description is unlikely. *. This paper with his son Antoine Deza, a fellow of the Fields Institute who holds a Canada Research Chair in Combinatorial Optimization at McMaster University, combines Michel Deza's interests in polyhedral combinatorics and metric spaces; it describes the metric polytope, whose points represent symmetric distance matrices satisfying the triangle inequality. For metric spaces with seven points, for instance, this polytope has 21 dimensions (the 21 pairwise distances between the points) and 275,840 vertices. *. Much of Deza's work concerns isometric embeddings of graphs (with their shortest path metric) and metric spaces into vector spaces with the L1 distance; this paper is one of many in this line of research. An earlier result of Deza showed that every L1 metric with rational distances could be scaled by an integer and embedded into a hypercube; this paper shows that for the metrics coming from planar graphs (including many graphs arising in chemical graph theory), the scale factor can always be taken to be 2\\\\.

He taught architecture at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Architecture, where he also served as dean. Bogdanoviƒá wrote numerous articles about urbanism, especially about its mythic and symbolic aspects, some of which appeared in international journals such as El Pa√≠s, Die Zeit, and others. He was also involved in politics, as a partisan in World War II, later as mayor of Belgrade. When Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá rose to power and nationalism gained ground in Yugoslavia, Bogdanoviƒá became a dissident. Bogdanoviƒá is best known for designing monuments and memorials commemorating victims and resistance fighters of World War II built all over Yugoslavia from the early 1950s to 1980s. In particular, the monumental concrete sculpture titled Stone Flower near the site of Jasenovac concentration camp gained international attention. Life Bogdanoviƒá was born into a family of leftist intellectuals. His father Milan was a literary critic, long-time president of the Association of Writers and director of the National Theatre. Beginning in 1940, Bogdan studied architecture at the University of Belgrade. He participated in World War II (\\"a bit\\" in his words) as a partisan, becoming a member of the Communist Party, and was seriously wounded in eastern Bosnia. Despite his injuries, he continued his academic career after the war, graduating in 1950, becoming a teaching assistant at the department for urbanism (from 1953), then a docent in 1960, extraordinary professor and president of the Yugoslav Union of Architects in 1964, dean of the Faculty of Architecture and a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) in 1970, and full professor in 1973. In 1981 he resigned from SANU, and he was conferred emeritus status in 1987. Being an ardent leftist, Bogdanoviƒá opposed the increasing nationalism espoused by state leaders since the early 1980s. Nonetheless, he became Mayor of Belgrade in 1982 on the initiative of Ivan Stamboliƒá, then chairman of the League of Communists of Serbia. Bogdanoviƒá served one term in office, until 1986. During this time, he organised an international competition for the complete redevelopment of New Belgrade, a planned area on the left bank of the Sava river. All submissions to this competition have since disappeared. After his term of office, he was appointed by Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá as a member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the party's supreme governing body. He accepted the post under the condition that he would not be required to attend committee meetings because he \\"had more important things to do\\". In the following year he sent Milo≈°eviƒá an anti-nationalist letter over 60 pages long, including a Stalino-dictionary, an appendix satirising the recipient's nationalist rhetoric, and the famous Lamentation for Serbia, which discussed the theme of Serbia \\"being tired\\" (of its leaders). The Central Committee replied, \\"You can send the letter, in which you criticise the work of the eighth meeting and which has not reached us, to the Central Committee if you consider it necessary\\". The letter, in combination with other remarks about Milo≈°eviƒá, led to attempts of breaking into Bogdanoviƒá's apartment, death threats, and his exclusion from the Central Committee. This, however, did not prevent him from renewing his anti-nationalist statements when the Yugoslav wars started at the beginning of the 1990s, once more turning Bogdanoviƒá into a target for violent attacks and a defamation campaign run by the Serbian state media. In 1993 Bogdanoviƒá went into self-imposed exile to Paris with his wife Ksenija. However, since the Yugoslav √©migr√© circle there had strong nationalistic tendencies, the couple moved on to settle in Vienna upon invitation of his friend, the writer and translator Milo Dor. Bogdanoviƒá died in a hospital in Vienna on 18 June 2010, following a heart attack. Teaching At the University of Belgrade, Bogdanoviƒá held the lecture course The development of housing schemes (later called History of town), starting in 1962. As professor and dean, he tried to reform the teaching of architecture and introduce grassroots democracy at the university, but the party forced him to abdicate before he could put his plans into practice. In 1976 he began to teach in an abandoned village school in Mali Popoviƒá near Belgrade to realise an alternative project, namely his \\"village school for the philosophy of architecture\\". The course was called Symbolic forms in allusion to Ernst Cassirer, had no fixed timetable and employed the invention of new writing systems, the interpretation of non-existent texts, as well as methods akin to free association and gematria. 14 years later, when henchmen of Milo≈°eviƒá raided the school in the aftermath of Bogdanoviƒá's letter, much of the collected material ‚Äì the documentation of the lessons, drawings, audio- and videotapes, optical devices ‚Äì was destroyed. Works The architectonic and literary work of Bogdanoviƒá is characterised by an abundance of ornaments. It is influenced by Romanticism and Victorian architecture, surrealism, metaphysics, Jewish symbolism and Kabbalah. Bogdanoviƒá has opposed the architectural theories of Adolf Loos developed in the essay Ornament and Crime, and argued for the \\"semantic dignity of the ornamental sign\\". =Memorials= Jasenovac monument (the Flower of Stone), Jasenovac Memorial Park Shrine to the fallen freedom fighters, Vlasotince In 1951 Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá won a competition for the design of a memorial to the Jewish victims of fascism, to be built on the Sephardic cemetery in Belgrade. Although not religious himself, this contact with Jewish esotericism strongly influenced his further work. From then on until 1981, he was assigned by Josip Broz Tito to devise more than 20 monuments and memorial places against fascism and militarism, which were erected in all republics of Yugoslavia. To work as cenotaphs for all victims of fascism, regardless of nationality and religion, they lack any symbols of communism or other ideologies. Instead, they rely on archaic, mythological forms, sharply contrasting with the principles of Socialist realism. This contrast also served Tito's wish to emphasise his country's independence from the Soviet Union. All of the memorials are built of stone, shaped by local untrained chisellers whom Bogdanoviƒá preferred to ones with formal education, who were inflexible in his opinion. The notable exception, the Jasenovac monument, consists of prestressed concrete, the formwork for which was constructed by shipwrights. Somewhat incongruously, it is known as the Flower of Stone. Examples of these monuments are: * Memorial to the Jewish victims of fascism, Belgrade, Sephardic cemetery, 1952 * Memorial grave to the victims of fascism, Sremska Mitrovica, 1960 * Group cenotaph to the fallen soldiers of the resistance, Prilep, 1961 * Symbolical necropolis, Slobodi≈°te (near Kru≈°evac), 1961 * Partisan monument, Mostar, 1965 * Jasenovac monument, Jasenovac, 1966 * Memorial cemetery, Leskovac, 1971 * Monument to the Massacre in Arapova Dolina, Leskovac, 1971 * Group cenotaph, Bela Crkva (near Krupanj), 1971 * Memorial to the fallen soldiers in all wars of liberation, Knja≈æevac, 1971 * Shrine dedicated to the Serb and Albanian partisans in the 1941‚Äì1945 war, Kosovska Mitrovica, 1973 * War grave, ≈†tip, 1974 * Group cenotaph of victims, Novi Travnik, 1975 * Shrine to the fallen freedom fighters, Vlasotince, 1975 * Freedom monument, Berane, 1977 * Dudik Memorial Park, Vukovar, 1980 * Memorial area with mausoleum for the warriors, ƒåaƒçak, 1980 * Garavice memorial park and with cenotaph dedicated to the 12,000 civil Nazi victims, Bihaƒá, 1981 * Mausoleum dedicated to the first who died in the anti-Fascist uprisings, Popina (near Vrnjaƒçka Banja), 1981 * Guardian of Freedom, Klis (near Split), 1987 (demolished in 1996) =Settlements= Bogdanoviƒá refused to participate in the planning of national housing estates which looked like \\"coffins of concrete\\" to him and had \\"only two types of windows\\". Consequently, he built only a single settlement: a housing estate for the hydrotechnical institute \\"Jaroslav ƒåerni\\" at the foot of the mountain Avala near Belgrade, finished in 1953. The houses are mostly built of stone; and with their surrealistic, old-fashioned style, heavily framed windows and oversized chimneys, they are deliberately set apart from the international style that dominated in post-WW2 Yugoslavia. Other settlements were planned in great detail, but never really intended to be built. Among those is a town in northern Montenegro, designed for local clients, and a mythological \\"town at the bottom of the lake (Biograd)\\" which Bogdanoviƒá designed for his own pleasure. =Other works of architecture= Other works of architecture include the reconstruction of the villa of Queen Natalija (Smederevo, 1961), Adonis' altar (Labin, 1974) and the Tomb of Du≈°an Petroviƒá-≈†ane (Aranƒëelovac, 1980). =Literature= Books and essays in Serbo-Croatian include:     Six of his books were published in German by Zsolnay and Wieser: * Die Stadt und der Tod, Wieser Verlag, Klagenfurt ‚Äì Salzburg 1993, * Der verdammte Baumeister: Erinnerungen [The doomed architect.

It was opened on 1 June 1864 by the Z√ºrich‚ÄìZug‚ÄìLucerne Railway (Z√ºrich-Zug-Luzern-Bahn). The Z√ºrich‚ÄìZug railway was opened by the same company at the same time.  Route The line was connected until 1970 at a triangular junction (\\"wye\\") at Kollerm√ºhle with the branch to Zurich Altstetten so that trains could run directly from Lucerne to Zurich. The station was a terminal station until the opening of the Thalwil‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway. With the introduction of the new line, the station was rebuilt with a station building between the diverging lines. The Zug reversing loop, which made it possible to run from both directions into the station, was also built at that time. This was closed in 1990. The line was electrified at 15 kV 16 ‚Öî Hz AC on 9 October 1922. Double track was opened between Zug and Cham on 5 May 1990. There have been two tracks between Kollerm√ºlle station and the branch to the Zug loop since the opening of the line, but these were used separately, that is one was used for services to/from Affoltern and the other to/from Rotkreuz. Up to that time, the trains from Affoltern always ran via the Zug loop. An isolated section of double track was opened between Ebikon station and Rotsee on 29 May 1994. The line between the stations of Ebikon and Gisikon-Root has also been double-track since 27 September 1995. When the line between Gisikon-Root and Rotkreuz was doubled, some bends were straightened so that the line speed could be increased. This section has been double-track since 11 May 1996. The line between Cham and Rotkreuz has been double track since 14 December 2008. Before that, not even the Cham‚ÄìH√ºnenberg Zythus section had been doubled. There was only a second track south of Zythus to H√ºnenberg Ch√§mleten station, which ended at a dead-end track.  History The railway was opened on 1 June 1864 by the Z√ºrich‚ÄìZug‚ÄìLucerne Railway. The opening of the Thalwil‚ÄìArth-Goldau line had, with the exception of the reconstruction in the area of Zug station, no great impact for the line itself, but trains running between Z√ºrich and Lucerne continued to use the Zug‚ÄìLucerne section. Only the operation of passenger trains running towards the Gotthard fell away between Kollerm√ºhle and Rotkreuz. Most freight trains from Z√ºrich to Rotkreuz continued to run via the rail triangle. When it was decided to transfer the former shunting yard on the approach to Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof to Z√ºrich M√ºlligen (only fast goods and postal traffic) and to Limmattal marshalling yard, it was clear that this traffic would be eliminated. For this reason, on 19 November 1970, the side of the rail triangle that connected Steinhausen with Cham was closed and dismantled. Freight trains now run via the Aargau Southern Railway to Rotkreuz. The introductions of two S-Bahn systems had some impact on the line. The introduction of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn in 1990, when the Zug loop was closed, had less impact. By contrast, the introduction of the 2004 Zug Stadtbahn in 2004 had a massive impact on the Zug‚ÄìLuzern line, which underwent a major refurbishment so that services could be introduced between Zug and Baar at quarter-hourly intervals. In addition, five additional stations were established.

His name is engraved on the Arc de triomphe. LifeEarly life= From an old noble family but orphaned very young, he embarked on the L√©g√®re aged 13 in 1766, before it sailed for the Antilles. He then voyaged in the Indian Ocean from 1767 to 1769, entering the gardes-marine in 1770 on Mauritius. He served on the scow Gros Ventre in Kerguelen's expeditions (1772‚Äì1774). Separated from the expedition's flagship Fortune by a storm, the Gros Ventre was considered lost with all hands, but after a difficult voyage it managed to make it back to France on its own. Kerguelen was accused (probably justly) of having abandoned the Gros Ventre when the latter was in difficulties and of being uninterested in its survival. =American Revolutionary War= Rising to ensign in 1777, he served on the frigate Belle Poule in the English Channel then on the Triton in Orvilliers's fleet in 1779. He commanded the cutter Sans Pareil in Guichen's fleet and fought in the battles over Dominica in April and May 1780. Captured by and two frigates, he quickly became the subject of a prisoner exchange and next commanded the cutter Serpent in the capture of Pensacola (May 1781). Then, having risen to lieutenant de vaisseau, he became second officer of the frigate Nymphe in 1782 and was thus in several battles, notably the capture of in February 1783 (in which battle Sercey took over command of the Nymphe when her captain was killed). He then campaigned in the Antilles from 1787 to 1792, commanding the frigate Ariel then the frigate Surveillante. =Revolution and the Indian Ocean= Rising to capitaine de vaisseau in 1792 and contre-amiral in January 1793, he commanded a division sent to Saint Domingue, but as an aristocrat was suspected of wanting to emigrate and so was arrested during the Reign of Terror. He was returned to his rank under the French Directory naval ministry of Truguet. He then commanded a division of four frigates setting out from Rochefort to take reinforcements, munitions and two Directory commissioners (Baco and Burnel) to Mauritius.Gu√©rin, vol.6, p. 192 Capturing several ships en route, he reached the Indian Ocean, where the forces already stationed at Mauritus were also put under his command. He thus had a small squadron of the corvette Br√ªle Gueule (commanded by Jean Fran√ßois Bruneau de la Souchais) and 7 frigates with talented captains: *Forte (Commander Beaulieu-Leloup) *Prudente (Magon) *R√©g√©n√©r√©e (Willaumez) *Vertu (Lhermitte) *Seine (Latour and later Bigot) *Cyb√®le (Tr√©houart) *Preneuse (Marqu√®s) These means were limited in the face of the strong Royal Navy presence in the region, of 10 ships of the line and 10 frigates. Moreover, Mauritius had no serious means of resupply or repairs since all troops sent from mainland France had to struggle against the hostility of the colonists, the colonial assembly and governor Malartic, all so worried by the rebellion on the Mascarene Islands that they proclaimed they would not put into effect the abolition of slavery decided upon in Paris. The colony refused to give Sercey's division any support and Sercey was reproached by Truguet for not intervening to support Baco and Burnel (expelled on arrival by the colonists). Sercey compensated for his force's weakness by keeping his ships constantly at sea and (operating a little like a private privateer) raising money for provisions by selling captured ships (including many East Indiamen). Fear of being unable to repair his frigates and his express orders to avoid giving battle sometimes led him to behave timidly. For example, he refused to capitalise on the manhandling of the ships of the line and by his frigates in the Action of 8 September 1796, refraining from pressing the issue and capturing the ship. His prudence also led him to avoid a \\"China convoy\\" in the Bali Strait, made up of six slow, heavy ships of the East India Company under commodore James Farquharson of , and including . In the ensuing Bali Strait Incident the convoy formed a line of battle on 28 January 1797 and thus tricked Sercey (at a distance) into believing they were warships and avoiding battle with them.Biden (1830), pp. 117‚Äì145. This bluff made Farquharson a celebrity and was greeted with rejoicing by the British press. =The end of Sercey's division= However, in 1798, though none of his ships had been captured, they were starting to show signs of wear and tear and little by little had to return to France for repair, depriving him of Vertu, R√©g√©n√©r√©e and Seine. Moreover, profiting by Sercey's absence, governor Malartic requisitioned Forte and Prudente as private vessels, armed them as privateers and put them under the command of incompetent captains, leading to both ships being captured at the start of 1799. This left Sercey only the frigate Preneuse (captain Lhermitte) and the corvette Br√ªle Gueule - far too small a force for such a large theatre. He thus looked for support from major Spanish naval forces in the area, setting up his headquarters at Surabaya to be closer to the Spanish base at Manila. Even so, he was unable to establish a true offensive alliance, with the Spanish captains feeling more sympathy with Great Britain (officially their enemy) than for republican and anti-religious France and with the few attempted joint Franco-Spanish operations being defeated. Returning to Mauritius with his last two remaining ships, for three weeks Sercey succeeded in beating off attacks from two ships of the line and two frigates which were blockading the island, in the second battle of the Black River. Nevertheless, despite its captain's exceptional talent, the Preneuse was finally destroyed by the British blockading forces in Mauritius's bay of Tombeau in December 1799, marking the end of Sercey's division and of the campaign. =Disgrace, retirement and death= He only returned to France in 1802, where he faced hostility from the naval minister Denis Decr√®s, who held him responsible for the fate of the Indian Ocean division. Disgusted by Decr√®s's attitude, Sercey returned to Mauritius, where he married and settled as a planter, playing an important role in the island's defence in the campaign that ended in its definitive capture by the British in 1810. He finally returned to France and was made vice-admiral in 1814 and a peer of France in 1832.

These were the culmination of French plans to force a passage through the English Channel, and so achieve a successful invasion of the United Kingdom. The plans were extremely complicated and proved to be impractical. Much of the detail was due to the personal intervention of Napoleon, who as a soldier rather than a sailor failed to consider the effects of weather, difficulties in communication, and the Royal Navy. Despite limited successes in achieving some elements of the plan the French commanders were unable to follow the main objective through to execution. The campaign, which took place over thousands of miles of ocean, was marked by several naval engagements, most significantly at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, where the combined fleet was decisively defeated, and from which the campaign takes its name. A final mopping up action at the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November completed the destruction of the combined fleet, and secured the supremacy of the Royal Navy at sea. French and British aims Napoleon had been planning an invasion of England for some time, with the first Army of England gathering on the Channel coast in 1798. Napoleon's concentration on campaigns in Egypt and Austria, and the Peace of Amiens caused these plans to be shelved in 1802. The resumption of hostilities in 1803 led to their revival, and forces were gathered outside Boulogne in large military camps in preparation for the assembling of the invasion flotilla. The Royal Navy was the main obstacle to a successful invasion, but Napoleon declared that his fleet need only be masters of the Channel for six hours and the crossing could be effected. Though the intended departure points were known and were being closely blockaded by the Royal Navy, First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Melville was short of ships. If a combined Franco-Spanish fleet were to force the Navy from its station for even a short while, the French invasion force might succeed in crossing unmolested. The French aimed to achieve at least temporary control of the Channel, while the British aimed to prevent this at all costs. Changing French plans Vice-Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson, by Lemuel Francis Abbott Napoleon proposed a total of four different strategies between July 1804 and March 1805, each with the object of collecting a large force of ships and moving up the Channel. Common elements included the decoying of some or all of the blockading Royal Navy fleets away from the Channel, the combining of the French fleets to lift the blockade of any ships that remained trapped in port, and the advancing of the fleet up the Channel to Boulogne, where they would escort the invasion force across. =Plan I: July ‚Äì September 1804= Pierre-Charles-Jean-Baptiste-Silvestre de Villeneuve, commander of the French forces that broke out of Toulon Napoleon's first plan, put forward in May 1804 for execution between July and September envisaged the break-out from Toulon of 10 ships of the line and 11 frigates under Admiral Latouche Tr√©ville. They would evade the patrolling British fleet under Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson and sail into the Atlantic, slipping past Alexander Cochrane's fleet off Ferrol and entering the Bay of Biscay. They would then make for Rochefort where they would be joined by another six ships of the line. While this was taking place Vice-Admiral Ganteaume would sail from Brest with 23 ships of the line and head out into the Atlantic, hopefully drawing the main British Channel Fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis after them. Latouche Tr√©ville would then have a clear run into the Channel and up to Boulogne, where he would escort the invasion fleet safely across. The plan was complicated and depended on the unlikely events of favourable weather, the avoidance of Cochrane's and Nelson's fleets and the decoying away of Cornwallis. The plan was never put into operation. Latouche Tr√©ville remained at Toulon rather than risk an encounter with Nelson, and died suddenly on 19 August, putting an end to the scheme. =Plan II: October 1804 ‚Äì early 1805= The revised invasion plan after the death of Latouche Tr√©ville was considerably more ambitious, and consisted of three distinct operations. Latouche Tr√©ville's successor at Toulon, Vice-Admiral Villeneuve, would board 5,600 troops and sail his 10 ships of the line into the Mediterranean on 21 October. Having evaded Nelson he would collect the Aigle from C√°diz and pass through the Strait of Gibraltar, after which he would detach two ships carrying 1,800 troops. He would then head to the West Indies with the rest of his force, while the two detached ships were assigned to fulfil one of the three operations included in the plan. They would sail to Saint Helena and capture the island from the British, before returning northwards to land at Senegal and stir up trouble in West Africa. Meanwhile, Rear-Admiral Missiessy was to sail from Rochefort on 1 November with six ships of the line and 3,500 troops. Having evaded the British blockade he would sail to the West Indies, reinforce the French garrisons at Martinique and Guadeloupe and capture the British colonies of Dominica and St Lucia. Having achieved this Villeneuve and Missiessy would unite and combine forces, giving the French a fleet of 15 ships of the line and 5,000 men. With this force they would capture Surinam and raid other Dutch and British possessions, before sailing back across the Atlantic. While this was taking place Ganteaume and his 21 ships of the line carrying 18,000 troops were to have sailed from Brest on 23 November, passed through the English Channel and into the North Sea, and then sailed around the coast of Scotland. They would arrive at Lough Swilly on the north coast of Ireland and land the troops. While a full-scale invasion of Ireland was under way Ganteaume would sail around the west coast of Ireland, arriving in the Western Approaches in time to meet Villeneuve and Missiessy's forces returning from the West Indies. With a combined force of nearly 40 ships of the line, the French would sweep up the Channel to Boulogne and effect the third and final part of the plan, the invasion of England. This plan, dependent on the weather, the non-interference of the British and subject to the vagaries of communication over thousands of miles of ocean verged on the impossible. The plan was never attempted, as the British intercepted the orders sent to Ganteaume, and the project was called off. =Plan III: January 1805= The strategic situation in Europe had altered considerably by January 1805. The Spanish had allied with France, but Napoleon was concerned about Austria and Russia, who appeared to be in negotiations with Britain. The danger of committing most of his forces across the Channel, from where they could not easily be recalled, had become clear to him. Should a combined Russian and Austrian force open a second front to the east, Napoleon would be hard pressed to deal with it. He decided to temporarily put his plans for invasion on hold, and developed a new strategy whereby his largely idle fleet could cause trouble for Britain. Villeneuve and Missiessy were ordered to embark troops and take their fleets to sea, where they would sail to the West Indies and attack the British possessions there. This would force the British to reallocate resources to defend them. Missiessy duly sailed from Rochefort on 11 January with five ships of the line, evaded Vice-Admiral Thomas Graves's blockading force and escaped into the Atlantic. Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane took his forces in pursuit, and both fleets sailed to the West Indies. Napoleon inspecting the Troops at Boulogne, 15 August 1804 Villeneuve finally sailed from Toulon on 18 January, heading into the teeth of a gale. Their departure was noted by the patrolling British frigates and , who rushed to report the news to Nelson, anchored at La Maddalena. Nelson immediately rushed his fleet to sea, determining that considering the weather and the fact the French had embarked troops, that Villeneuve was heading east, perhaps to attack locations on the Italian coast, or the islands of Malta or Sardinia, or maybe even Greece or Egypt. He rushed south, hoping to intercept them south of Sardinia, but when they had not appeared by 25 January, he worried that he had missed them, and pressed further east, calling at Greece and then Alexandria on 7 February. Finding no news of the French he turned westward, calling at Malta on 19 February, where he received news that the French were back in Toulon. Villeneuve had in fact turned to port just two days after setting out, forced back by the weather and the inability of his ships and sailors to cope with it. The error of the frigates leaving the fleet unobserved when they had rushed to report to Nelson meant that he had spent nearly six weeks sailing back and forth across the Mediterranean through heavy seas while the French remained in port. A frustrated Nelson returned to resume the blockade. Strategic situation in March 1805 The French Navy was largely confined to port, blockaded by various fleets and commands of the Royal Navy, while the main invasion force of 93,000 men in four Army corps waited in Boulogne. A combined French and Dutch squadron of nine ships of the line were quartered in the Netherlands, covered by Admiral Lord Keith's Downs squadron of 11 ships of the line. Neither squadron took part in the campaign. The main Channel Fleet, patrolling between Ushant and the Irish coast under Admiral William Cornwallis and his deputy Vice-Admiral Charles Cotton, consisted of 15 ships of the line, with detached squadrons of five ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves blockading Rochefort, and eight ships of the line under Vice-Admiral Robert Calder blockading Ferrol. They were maintaining a tight blockade over the French Atlantic forces, consisting of 21 ships of the line at Brest under Vice-Admiral Ganteaume, three or four ships of the line at Rochefort, and four French ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Gourdon and eight Spanish ships of the line under Admiral Grandallana at Ferrol. Six Spanish ships of the line and one French one were in port at C√°diz, under the watchful eyes of Rear- Admiral John Orde and his five ships of the line, with another six Spanish ships of line located at Cartagena under Admiral Salcedo. The French naval base at Toulon was home to 11 French ships of the line under Vice-Admiral Villeneuve, who was being kept bottled up by the 12 ships of the line of the Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson. Each commander had a number of frigates, sloops and brigs at their disposal. Further afield, Missiessy, pursued by Cochrane, sailed around the West Indies, but without making contact with each other. Napoleon recalled Missiessy once it became clear the Villeneuve had remained trapped in Toulon, and Missiessey began to voyage back to France on 28 March. March 1805 brought a significant development for Napoleon, an assurance from the Austrians that they did not plan to make war on France. Napoleon resolved to return to his scheme for the invasion of Britain, and drew up a new plan. The Trafalgar Campaign: The French plan The fleet at Brest under Ganteaume was to embark 3,000 troops and sail to Ferrol, where he would chase away Calder's blockading squadron and unite with the French and Spanish forces in the port under Gourdon and Grandallana. Having amassed a force of 33 ships of the line, six frigates and two storeships, they would sail to Martinique. Meanwhile, Villeneuve was to have embarked 3000 troops and sailed from Toulon. He would break out into the Atlantic, and having collected another seven ships of the line from C√°diz, he would sail to the rendezvous in the West Indies. The three fleets‚ÄîGanteaume's 33 ships of the line; Missiessy's five ships of the line, if they were still in the area; and Villeneuve's 11 ships of the line‚Äîwould unite and sail back across the Atlantic. Sweeping away any resistance, they would then cover the invasion flotilla. =Ganteaume blockaded= Ganteaume had got his fleet ready for sea by 24 March, but Brest was being closely blockaded by Vice-Admiral Cotton's 17 ships of the line. Ganteaume had orders to avoid battle, and waited until conditions seemed favourable on 26 March, when a fog came down that would help him to slip past the British. But as he made his way out the weather changed suddenly, blowing away the fog and making it difficult to return to the anchorage. Temporarily trapped outside the port Ganteaume reluctantly prepared for battle as Cotton's force approached. Cotton did not however risk an engagement with night closing, many shoals and with the enemy fleet under the guns of French shore batteries, and chose to merely observe and blockade Ganteaume. The following day the wind changed, allowing Ganteaume to return to port, where he spent the rest of the campaign. =Villeneuve escapes= Villeneuve and his second in command, Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, hurried to ready the Toulon-based fleet for departure. Nelson had been spotted near Barcelona and Villeneuve hoped that by sailing due south from Toulon and passing east of the Balearic Islands, he might avoid the patrolling British. In reality Nelson was preparing a trap, and having allowed himself to be observed off the Spanish coast, had withdrawn to a position south of Sardinia, hoping that in attempting to avoid the supposed location of the British fleet, Villeneuve would sail straight into them. Villeneuve put to sea on 30 March, observed by the British frigates Active and , and as Nelson hoped, set course to sail between the Balearic Islands and Sardinia. The frigates lost sight of the French fleet on 1 April, the same day that Villeneuve came across a Spanish merchant, and learnt that Nelson had been sighted off Sardinia. Realising that he was sailing into an ambush, Villeneuve turned west, passing to the west of the Balearics. With no visual contact with the French, Nelson was left in the dark as to their intentions. Villeneuve pressed on to Cartegena, but did not dare wait for the Spanish ships there after they declined to join him until orders from Madrid arrived. Instead he hurried on, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar on 8 April, observed by the British squadron under Sir John Orde. From C√°diz Villeneuve collected the French 74-gun Aigle and set off across the Atlantic to the West Indies, followed by six Spanish ships of the line and a frigate under Federico Gravina. Nelson meanwhile had been alerted of the French departure, but having failed to make contact with them off Sardinia, was reduced to combing the area with his frigates for any news of them. After having finally determined that the entire force must have left the Mediterranean he himself beat through the straits, where he received confirmation on 8 May from one of Orde's ships that the French had sailed through the straits a month earlier, and had not headed north. Convinced that Villeneuve was headed for the West Indies Nelson set off in pursuit. Villeneuve in the West Indies Villeneuve arrived at Fort de France, Martinique on 14 May, and was joined over the next two days by the Spanish under Gravina. Having resupplied, he settled in to await the arrival of Ganteaume, who unbeknownst to him was still sitting blockaded in Brest. Initially reluctant to undertake any large scale assaults on the British possessions in the Caribbean without orders, he was finally persuaded by the Governor of Martinique to attack the British held Diamond Rock after two weeks of sitting idle at anchor. The small garrison surrendered on 2 June, by which time the frigate Didon had arrived with orders. Villeneuve was instructed to await the arrival of two extra ships under Rear-Admiral Ren√© Magon, and then spend a month attacking and capturing the British colonies in the West Indies. He was then to sail his entire force back to Europe, join Ganteaume at Brest and cover the invasion flotilla. The orders also noted that Nelson had sailed to Egypt in search of him. In fact Nelson was by now only two days away from Barbados, where he would anchor on 4 June. Villeneuve gathered his forces and pressed northwards towards Antigua, but on 7 June he came across a lightly defended convoy of British merchants, and captured several of them the following day. From them he discovered that Nelson had arrived at Barbados. A shocked Villeneuve decided to break off operations and head north and east again, back to Europe. The fleet got underway on 11 June, causing one of the army officers attached to the fleet, General Honor√© Charles Reille to note > We have been masters of the sea for three weeks with a landing force of 7000 > to 8000 men and have not been able to attack a single island. Nelson in the West Indies Nelson had arrived at Barbados on 4 June, where he received fragmentary reports that the French had been seen a week earlier, sailing southwards. Nelson set off in pursuit, but the information was wrong, Villeneuve and his fleet were north of Barbados and heading farther north with each day. A series of mistaken sightings, deliberate misinformation, and sheer coincidence kept Nelson heading south until 8 June, when more concrete information reached him that Villeneuve was north of his position, and heading towards Antigua. He finally reached Antigua on 12 June, and learnt that Villeneuve had passed by the day before, headed for Europe. Nelson left in pursuit on 13 June, anticipating that his quarry would make either for C√°diz, or would attempt to re-enter the Mediterranean. Villeneuve was in fact heading for Ferrol, and by hoping to catch them at sea before they could make port, Nelson set his course too far to the south and missed them. He eventually arrived at Gibraltar on 19 July, after which he sailed his fleet to join the Channel Fleet under Cornwallis, before taking the into Portsmouth. Villeneuve intercepted Nelson had sent despatches back to the Admiralty aboard the brig . While sailing across the Atlantic Curieux had, on 19 June, spotted the combined Franco-Spanish fleet, sailing northwards from Antigua. Curieux shadowed them, and determined that they were not heading for the Straits as Nelson had predicted, but were instead likely to arrive in the Bay of Biscay. The despatches and news of the latest sighting were rushed to Lord Barham at the Admiralty, who instructed a reinforced fleet under Vice-Admiral Robert Calder to attempt to intercept the combined fleet as it arrived off Cape Finisterre. Calder duly received an extra five ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling and on 22 July the enemy fleet was sighted heading westwards towards Ferrol. William Anderson Calder then moved south to intercept, while Villeneuve assembled his force into the line of battle and began moving north. The two fleets moved slowly past each other, before Calder came about by tacking in succession and began to close on the enemy's rear. The action eventually began when the frigate , in the van of the British fleet, attempted to attack the French frigate Sir√©ne, trailing in the rear. Fearing the British were attempting to cut off his rear, Villeneuve brought his fleet about and the Spanish van opened fire on the leading British ships at about 5.30 pm. The action quickly became general, but in the failing light, mist and gunsmoke both fleets soon became scattered. By the time the action broke off at 9.30 pm, two Spanish ships had been isolated and captured. Both fleets were still scattered the following day. They continued to observe each other, but neither made an attempt to resume the action, and despite more favourable winds on 24 July, Calder declined to give battle. By 25 July the fleets had drifted out of sight of each other, at which point Villeneuve sailed south to Vigo, while Calder headed east. Both admirals claimed a victory, with Villeneuve assuring Napoleon that he intended to sail north to rendezvous with Allemand's force from Rochefort, before heading to the Channel. On 10 August off Cape Finesterre HMS Phoenix under Captain Thomas Baker captured the French 40 gun frigate Didon. Didon was carrying despatches instructing Rear-Admiral Allemand's five ships of the line to unite with the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Villeneuve. While sailing to Gibraltar with his prize in tow, Baker fell in with the 74-gun on 14 August.Tracy (2006), 20 The following day the combined fleet under Villeneuve, heading for Brest and then on to Boulogne to escort the French invasion forces across the Channel sighted the three British ships. Villeneuve mistook the British ships for scouts from the Channel Fleet and fled south to Cadiz to avoid an action. A furious Napoleon raged 'What a Navy! What an admiral! All those sacrifices for nought!' Finisterre and Villeneuve's retreat became the decisive action of the campaign as far as the invasion of England went, for abandoning all hope of fulfilling his plans to secure control of the Channel Napoleon gathered the Arm√©e d'Angleterre, now renamed the Grand Arm√©e, and headed east to attack the Austrians in the Ulm Campaign. Battle of Trafalgar Villeneuve's fleet underwent repairs in C√°diz, covered by a hastily assembled blockade of British warships, initially commanded by Rear-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, and from 27 September by Vice-Admiral Nelson, who had arrived from England to take command. He spent the following weeks preparing and refining his tactics for the anticipated battle and dining with his captains to ensure they understood his intentions. Nelson had devised a plan of attack that anticipated the allied fleet would form up in a traditional line of battle. Drawing on his own experience from the Nile and Copenhagen, and the examples of Duncan at Camperdown and Rodney at the Saintes, Nelson decided to split his fleet into squadrons rather than forming it into a similar line parallel to the enemy. These squadrons would then cut the enemy's line in a number of places, allowing a pell-mell battle to develop in which the British ships could overwhelm and destroy parts of their opponents' formation, before the unengaged enemy ships could come to their aid. The Battle of Trafalgar by J. M. W. Turner (oil on canvas, 1822‚Äì1824) combines events from several moments during the battle Napoleon, increasingly dissatisfied with Villeneuve's performance, ordered Vice-Admiral Fran√ßois Rosily to go to C√°diz and take command of the fleet, sail it into the Mediterranean to land troops at Naples, before making port at Toulon. Villeneuve decided to sail the fleet out before his successor arrived. On 20 October the fleet was sighted making its way out of harbour by patrolling British frigates, and Nelson was informed that they appeared to be headed to the west. Nelson led his column of ships into battle aboard HMS Victory, and succeeded in cutting the line and causing the pell- mell battle he desired to break out. After several hours of fighting 17 French and Spanish ships had been captured and another destroyed, without the loss of a single British ship. Nelson was among the 449 British dead, having been mortally wounded by a French sharpshooter during the battle. Nine of the prizes were later scuttled or sunk in a storm that blew up the following day. A sortie led by some of the ships that managed to escape under Julien Cosmao managed to recapture the Spanish Santa Ana, but in doing so he lost three more of his ships, wrecked in the gale, while a fourth was captured by the British, but later wrecked. The British fleet and the surviving French prizes put into Gibraltar over the next few days. Cape Ortegal The Battle of Cape Ortegal by Thomas Whitcombe Though the combined fleet had been decisively crushed at Trafalgar, the final action of the campaign was fought nearly a fortnight later, on 4 November. Four French ships under Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley had escaped Trafalgar and headed north, hoping to reach Rochefort. On 2 November they came across the 36-gun frigate , some forty miles of Cape Ortegal. They gave chase, but the Phoenix lured them towards a squadron of five ships of the line under Captain Sir Richard Strachan. Strachan led his ships in pursuit, coming in range and opening the attack on 4 November, despite one of his ships of the line not being with the squadron. Using his frigates to harass and wear down the enemy while avoiding their broadsides, Strachan used his larger ships to attack the enemy's rear and centre. He was eventually able to surround the French ships, and after four hours of close fighting all of the French ships were forced to surrender. Outcome and significance Detail from a modern reproduction of an 1805 poster commemorating the battle By early November the combined fleet had been practically destroyed. Two ships of the line had been lost at Finisterre, twenty-one at Trafalgar and in the ensuing storm, and four at Cape Ortegal. No British ships had been lost in these engagements. Many of those that had survived in French or Spanish hands were badly damaged and would not be ready for service for some time. The British victory gave them unchallenged supremacy of the seas, securing British trade and sustaining the Empire. The continued failure of Napoleon to marshal his navies as he did his armies meant that the invasion of England never occurred. Already postponed several times, Villeneuve's defeat at Finisterre and his final failure to link up with the Rochefort and Brest fleets caused Napoleon to abandon his plans in favour of a march eastward. Trafalgar, with its 74 ships, became the last clash of its scale of the Napoleonic Wars; from then on the largest engagements were fought between no more than a dozen ships. After 1805 the morale of the French navy was destroyed, while its continued blockade in port robbed it of efficiency and will. While Napoleon returned to the possibility of an invasion some years later, it was never with the same focus or determination. The failure of his navy to fulfil its objectives left him disillusioned, while the timidity of its commanders and the determination of the British to resist them, both factors clearly expressed at various stages throughout the Trafalgar campaign, left the navy with a lack of purpose and direction. Notes a. Not of all of the ships saw action at any one time, or at all, but represent the strength of the main fleets positioned in European waters. Frigates and smaller vessels are not included. b. The ships arriving with Magon were the 74-gun Alg√©siras and Achille, carrying 850 soldiers between them. c. Both were Spanish vessels, the 80-gun San Rafael and the 74-gun Firme. d. Calder was court-martialled for his failure to 'do his utmost' to renew the engagement. He missed Trafalgar to attend, was found guilty and severely reprimanded. He never received another active command. e. See Trafalgar order of battle and casualties for more details.

The project was created by Shota Nakama, a Boston-based producer from Okinawa, Japan. Comparative to the other existing major video game concert acts, which mostly focus on the pure orchestral performances, the rock band element is the core essence of the VGO. Their concerts are presented as a rock show with entertaining audience engagement and improvised solos. HistoryFormation and debut= Video Game Orchestra was founded by Shota Nakama, a graduate from Berklee College of Music and The Boston Conservatory, in May 2008. VGO became comprised by a group of Boston-based professional musicians, assembled by Shota himself. His own intentions with the group was to deliver something very different and fresh to the world. VGO's debut concert, A Night of Symphonic Video Game Music, was held at Gordon Chapel in Old South Church in Boston on July 2, 2008. The orchestra, or rather a small ensemble of 28 musicians including Shota himself playing the guitar, performed the music from popular titles such as Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana, and Metal Gear Solid. Their second concert was held at Church of the Covenant of Boston on November 2, 2008, which also saw the addition of a full rock band and choir. = The ensemble = Video Games Orchestra comprises a group of musicians, both young and established talents from local communities, as well as talents from around the world. Featuring a rock band consisting of drums, two guitars, bass, keyboards, percussion, violin soloist and one/two vocalist led by Shota Nakama. The band is usually accompanied by a string section or orchestra. Regular members performers of the orchestra include; During international shows, VGO frequently features local talents as special guests and ensembles for the performances. For instance the Kumamoto Orchestra during their Capcom Live show at Kyushu and a local China Jazz horn section during ChinaJoy. =2009= VGO's concert on March 5 at the Berklee Performance Center was sold out and became a landmark for Berklee College of Music by being the first concert of its kind that the school participated in. In attendance were four of America's most prolific video game composers, Jack Wall, Gerard Marino, Duncan Watt, and Keith Zizza with Wall conducting his own compositions with the VGO. It received heavy promotion and the orchestra was featured on NECN News, Boston Globe,http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/12/05/video_game_orchestra_at_berklee_performance_center/ and numerous other papers, radio stations, and websites around the world. On May 7, 2009, Independent Game Conference hosted VGO as its closing event and was held at Fenway Center in Boston. This concert featured the VGO chamber group outfit for the first time in a very intimate acoustic setting. The group was asked to perform at Anime Boston as the opening act for the main musical guest, Kalafina and Yuki Kajiura. The concert was held at Hynes Convention Center Auditorium on May 23, 2009. VGO featured its chamber group along with the rock band. To honor the presence of Yuki Kajiura, they included an Anime song from Tsubasa Chronicle that Kajiura composed in their set list. VGO also had a special appearance at the end of the Music for Video Games workshop at Berklee College of Music. Norihiko Hibino, a composer from the Metal Gear Solid franchise, attended the concert. After a year of experimenting with different performance styles, the VGO decided to return to their full orchestra size for their big show in their home town of Boston. The concert entitled ~Awakening~ was held at the Berklee Performance Center and took place on December 5, 2009. ~Awakening~ featured an accomplished film/game composer, Wataru Hokoyama. =2010= During PAX East 2010 at Hynes Convention Center in March 2010, VGO was featured as one of seven musical guests,http://www.paxsite.com/paxeast/ performing alongside more visible and tenured performers such as Jonathan Coulton and The Protomen. Starting the proceedings on the first day of concerts, their performance was hailed as the best of the night. Capped with a standing ovation and incessant chants. The show was so successful that PAX East has invited the group back each year since. VGO returned for Anime Boston at Hynes Convention Center on April 2, 2010, this time with its full group unlike the previous year. The convention guest of honor, Nobuo Uematsu, had a surprise appearance on One Winged Angel during the encore, marking one of the first times the famous composer has performed alongside a video game cover band.http://www.originalsoundversion.com/?p=8917 =2011 and breakthrough= During 2011, VGO reached another milestone by performing at the Boston Symphony Hall which marked the first time that video game music was featured as a main draw in the venue. The show was titled Back to the Future ~Rockestral Renditions of Timeless Video Game and Film Music~ and sold out all tickets within only days, and was attended by music industry legends such as Alan Silvestri and Howard Shore. The show was a monumental success, and gained VGO nationwide coverage and high praise from the music communities. The group spent the rest of the year touring conventions and video game festivals, including making their first appearance at PAX Prime in Seattle on January 13, 2011. Announced in November 2011, VGO was selected to perform for Distant Worlds for a March 10, 2012 Concert. =2012: Distant Worlds, Kickstarter and China Tour= After Nakama appeared as a special guest during a concert in Pittsburgh on February 25, VGO was personally selected by conductor Arnie Roth as the orchestra to perform the world touring Distant Worlds program on their tour stop in Boston, officially sanctioned by Square Enix and based on the legendary Final Fantasy video game franchise. The concert was held on March 10 in Boston Symphony Hall, and gained high praise and sold out within mere days of tickets being put on sale. After several convention shows, a new concert was announced in August titled ~Live At Symphony Hall~, and would see VGO return to Boston Symphony Hall after their success with Distant Worlds. Uniquely, a Kickstarter campaign was launched at the same time as the concert was announced in order to fund an official live recording album, to be released in Spring of 2013. Setting the goal amount at $30,000, the campaign would in the end go past the projected end sum and raise over $37,000. ~Live At Symphony Hall~ was held on October 7. The event was sold out, and in attendance was 4 of Japan's most prolific names in the video game music industry, Kinuyo Yamashita, Yoko Shimomura, Noriyuki Iwadare, and Hitoshi Sakimoto. Each composer was honored by a piece based on their works, including the first time music from the game Grandia was performed live by an orchestra outside Japan. The concert saw a large amount of international media and attention, including being featured on the Japanese television network NHK for their El Mundo program, as well as a large interview in Asahi Shimbun. Building on their success from ~Live At Symphony Hall~, VGO embarked on their first international tour, doing a 4 show tour in China. The tour marked the first time a video game based music act has toured China, and drew over 9,000 attendees. =2013: Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII= Riding off the success of their performances at Distant Worlds and the many PAXs they've attended, VGO was invited as a special guest for the 11th iteration of MagFest, playing alongside nerdcore stalwarts Brentalfloss and Powerglove.

It is a scene of tranquillity: a woman and children quietly enjoying themselves by a glass- flat, tree-flanked lake. Generally acknowledged as one of his masterpieces, it is among the most successful of Corot's later, more poetic works. The painting captures an idealized scene while still drawing from the real world. Corot's early painting showed Realist leanings, but as his career progressed he began to combine more Romantic elements, and his works are often viewed as a bridge between Realism and the evolving Impressionist movement. Souvenir de Mortefontaine verges on the Impressionistic, with the lake and landscape captured by broad rather than detailed strokes and Corot's careful attention to the play of light within the scene, though the brushwork is precise and the painting has a more muted palette than the bright colours favoured by the Impressionists. The indistinct features are reminiscent of the blurry details of early landscape photography; Corot had a large collection of these photographs and may have been attempting to recreate the effect in paint. The Boatman of Mortefontaine (1865‚Äì70) Souvenir de Mortefontaine (detail) Mortefontaine is a small village in the Oise d√©partement in northern France. Corot made frequent visits to the area in the 1850s to study the effects of light and reflection on water. In Souvenir de Mortefontaine Corot was not producing a scene from life, but (as the title suggests) his recollections of his visits and the play of light on the ponds in the village. Corot produced a second similar painting, The Boatman of Mortefontaine (1865‚Äì70), which shows the same lake and trees from the same perspective. Changes in the features of the landscape in The Boatman from those depicted in Souvenir hint at the paintings being generalised impressions rather than details captured from life. Souvenir de Mortefontaine was purchased in 1864 for the French state directly from Corot through Napoleon III's Civil List, and after hanging at Fontainebleau for 25 years it was transferred to the Louvre in 1889.

The building, prominently located on Constitution Avenue, is on the only privately held lot in the area, surrounded by protected Federal lands. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History The American Institute of Pharmacy Building was designed by architect John Russell Pope and completed in 1933. It is a one-story building with a full basement partially above grade. Structure is steel and brick with reinforced concrete floor and roof. The building is faced with Vermont marble and faces a wide terrace that overlooks the stepped slope leading down to the Lincoln Memorial. The building is arranged with a strongly centralized mass with subordinate wings to either side. A single monumental door flanked by pilasters and large bronze lamps is the sole punctuation of the facade. Allegorical relief sculpture by Ulysses Ricci embellishes the entrance surround. The building was conceived by Pope to be complementary to the Lincoln Memorial. Because of the prominence of the site and its relationship to the Lincoln Memorial the American Institute of Pharmacy was required to make extensive land acquisitions and exchanges with the government to create suitable buffers and to allow for the widening of 23rd Street as it approaches the Memorial. White marble was specifically stipulated as the exterior cladding material. The interior is arranged around a central rotunda, accompanied by a small museum and library, now board room and reception space. Offices are located to the rear, while the basement was planned as laboratory, service and storage space. The rotunda is capped by a low dome resting on pendentives and lighted by an oculus. The flanking museum and library are lighted by skylights. A three-story addition was built in 1959-1961, designed by Eggers and Higgins and subordinated to the design of the main building. Further additions took place in 2007-2009.

Upon his arrival, he joined the Pan Africanist Congress. As a refugee in Botswana, he was sent by the Botswana Government to the Dukwe Refugee Camp, and from there left for Tanzania, and then Guinea, where he underwent military training. Returning to Botswana on an Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) assignment, he was expelled from the country and crossed the border to Zimbabwe, where he was detained as an illegal immigrant. After being released, he was appointed by the PAC as Chief representative to Uganda, but Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni turned down his appointment in favour of an old colleague. He was then appointed to APLA's high command, where he helped orchestrate several high-profile attacks against whites in South Africa, stating that he \\"regarded all whites as legitimate targets as they were complicit in the government's policy of apartheid\\". Still based in Zimbabwe, he was responsible for couriering arms from Botswana to South Africa, but was arrested in Botswana and sentenced to five years imprisonment. Ignored by the PAC and forced to rely upon African National Congress members for food and supplies, he embarked on a hunger strike and was visited by then PAC-president Zephania Mothopeng.

The project was part-financed by the European Union as part of the BSR INTERREG IIIB programme, and managed by √òstfold County Council in Norway. The national Healthy Cities networks in the Baltic Sea Region and the World Health Organization both supported HEPRO. The HEPRO concept was based on the principles of the WHO \\"Health for All\\" strategy and Local Agenda 21. 32 partners from 8 countries participated in the HEPRO project. These were Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. The partners represented institutions, cities, municipalities, and regions from diverse and challenged parts of the Baltic Sea Region. Aims HEPRO aimed to integrate health considerations into spatial planning and development. Strong emphasis was given to empowerment; including equity, participatory governance and solidarity, collaboration and action to address the determinants of health. The project also aimed to make an important contribution to a sustainable public health policy in Europe. Results Among the results from the project were the HEPRO planning model, the HEPRO survey model, a questionnaire that was answered by 33000 respondents in the Baltic Sea Region, an interactive webpage and a database of results for future research purposes. It is intended that HEPRO will be followed-up by a new project that builds upon its results and experiences. =The HEPRO planning model= The HEPRO planning model is a systematic approach in six steps linked together in a \\"planning circle\\". Because policymaking is a continuous process, the different stages in the circle do not have to follow a fixed order. Implementation of one public health activity can go on simultaneously with efforts to create attention and to put other activities on the political agenda. HEPRO was regarded as a territorial and cross-sectorial approach to planning that sought political power in order to improve living conditions, and as an institution building process. The intention was that after the project, the communities would have a better capacity to lead themselves, to focus their challenges, organise and help themselves, and to learn from their experiences. =The HEPRO survey model= The EUROHEPRO survey in 2006 included questions about issues influencing health and well being, ranging from health risks to individuals, to social environment and socio-economic status. The conceptual framework, called the HEPRO model, is described as a broad social, physical and spatial health concept where health and well-being was viewed as something more than just absence of disease and illness. The main focus of the HEPRO model is health, as defined by the various professional actors in the field, as well as by the citizens themselves, or other important actors.

Note LaMine Township in the northwest of the map. From p. 7 of \\"Illustrated Historical Atlas of Cooper County, Missouri\\" (State Historical Society of Missouri)in Cooper County, in the U.S. state of Missouri. Twenty- two of Missouri's 114 counties, including Cooper County, have civil township governments. The other 92 counties have townships which are geographical but not governmental (civil). According to the 1860 Census, the population of Lamine Township was 830 (524 whites, 306 slaves). As of the 2010 Census, Lamine Township's population was 268, a decrease from the 2000 Census population of 289. The township takes its name from the Lamine River. The only town in the Lamine Township is the unincorporated community of Lamine. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, Lamine Township covers an area of 40.86 square miles (105.83 square kilometers); of this, 39.5 square miles (102.31 square kilometers, 96.67 percent) is land and 1.36 square miles (3.52 square kilometers, 3.33 percent) is water. History On June 8, 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition traveling on the Missouri River arrived at the mouth of the LaMine River in what would come to be known as the Lamine Township. LaMine was settled in 1811 by Revolutionary War veteran David Jones (1761-1838), his son-in-law Stephen Turley (1786-1851), Jesse B. Turley (1801-1861), Samuel Turley (1790-1870), Thomas McMahan (1786-1859), James McMahan (1789-1857), William Reid (1774-1854), and Saunders Townsend In 1812 or 1813 there was a Fort McMahan in the Lamine Township, exact location unknown. On March 2, 1819 Stephen Turley was granted a license to operate a ferry across the Lamine River. On March 2, 1819 John Potter was appointed constable of Lamine Township by the Cooper County Court. On April 9, 1821 Bryant T. Nolan was appointed constable of the Lamine Township by the Cooper County Court. The first will probated by Cooper County was that of Thomas McMahan, a resident of the Lamine Township in 1821. Turley Bridge over the Lamine River in Lamine was built in 1906 and replaced in 1937 [ ]. One span of the bridge was sold to Boone County, Missouri and is on Moon Valley Road Hinkson Creek Trail [ ]. The other span now crosses the Petite Saline Creek near Gooch's Mill. Thomas McMahan House, Lamine, Missouri Hopewell Indian Settlements There are two known Hopewell Indian Settlements in the Lamine township: the Mellor settlement and the Imhoff settlement (100-300 A.D.). The Mellor settlement is at the confluence of the Lamine River with the Missouri River on the property known as \\"Cape Verde\\" [ ] owned in the early 1900s by Thomas Edward Mellor and then by his son John Paul Mellor. \\"At least 20 large earthen burial mounds overlook the Mellor settlement from the north-facing Missouri River escarpment.\\" The Imhoff settlement is about one-half mile downstream from the confluence of the Blackwater River with the Lamine River. These two settlements were excavated in the 1970s by archaeologist Marvin Kay and the findings were published in the Missouri Archaeological Society Research Series in 1980.

It was filmed on location in the Philippines. Plot Prior to the 1944 American invasion of the Philippines a hand-picked team of U.S. Marine Corps amphibious reconnaissance scouts is landed by a PBY Catalina with the mission of contacting an intelligence agent who has crucial information. Each Marine is not only experienced but has a special skill with the exception of the radio operator, PFC Grenier (James Mitchum). Grenier, an air crew radioman with only six months in the Corps is taken off the PBY's air crew when the original radio operator suddenly became medically unfit for the mission. He is given the sick Marine's radio and camouflage jacket to carry on his first ground combat mission. He serves as a narrator to the audience. After meeting up with their guide (Manual Amado), the patrol commander Captain Alonzo Davis (Lieutenant Colonel Clement J. Stadler who had been awarded the Navy Crosshttp://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/02_awards/index_nx/index-NXs.html and who also acted as the film's technical advisor) is killed while ambushing a small group of Japanese soldiers, and First Sergeant Corey (Hugh O'Brian, recognized as one of the youngest Drill Instructors to have served in the USMC) takes command. Pvt. George George and Pfc. Henry Reynolds are killed while taking out a Japanese tank and patrol. Cpl. Stanley Parrish (Greg Amsterdam, the son of Morey Amsterdam) is killed by a guerrilla trap soon after. As they walk on, Amado is shot by a Japanese officer while scaling a small hill. The marines let him die to keep their presence secret. Grenier is eventually told by Gunnery Sergeant Wartell (Mickey Rooney) that they were sent to recover some important information from a contact in a tea house whose radio was destroyed, thus explaining the radio's importance to the mission. Grenier's inexperience and incompetence arouses anger amongst Corey and the other members of the patrol. His only friend is easy going but professional Gunnery Sergeant Wartell who acts as a mediator between the hard no nonsense 1st Sgt Corey and Grenier, explaining each one to the other and the audience. Rooney provides the only comedy relief in the film when his character is captured and interrogated by a group of careless Japanese soldiers. The surviving squad members eventually arrive at the tea house but, unfortunately, Amado was the one who was supposed to meet the contact as he was the only Filipino in the group. Desperate, Corey decides to met the contact, Miyazaki a Japanese-American woman from Long Beach, California. While sneaking out of the camp with Miyazaki, Corey crashes into a waiter and the two run across a straw bridge then blow it up with a grenade, escaping from the soldiers. Meanwhile, a large skirmish with a Japanese patrol has killed Cpl. Alvin Ross and Platoon Sergeant William Maccone, shot the radio up beyond repair, and wounded Gunnery Sergeant Wartell. Wartell, knowing he will slow the survivors down, tells the reluctant Corey to leave him behind. When they leave, he plants grenades under himself and is captured by the Japanese soldiers. After toying with them a bit during his interrogation he sets off the grenades, taking them all out in the blast, and leaving Corey and Grenier the only surviving marines. The explosion is heard by the survivors and they sadly track on. Corey and Grenier learn from Miyazaki that the Japanese are expecting the invasion fleet and have placed a mine field powerful enough to destroy the entire fleet in the water around the invasion sites. Arriving at a friendly Filipino village, Corey and Grenier are able to escape a Japanese patrol by boat. But Miyazaki is killed by an officer she seduced to buy the guys some time. At last discovering the principles of mission accomplishment, altruism, and self-sacrifice through observation, Grenier becomes a squared away Marine. He and his First Sergeant infiltrate the enemy base to remotely detonate the minefield with the Japanese radio transmitter. As Corey provides a one-man army diversion, Grenier is able to detonate the mines by radio control. Grenier then steals a radio and goes to tell Corey of their success, only to find Corey dead of blood loss from wounds he got while holding off the Japanese, leaving Grenier the sole survivor of the mission. Grenier escapes to the coast and radios for pick up. The movie ends with Grenier looking at the ocean while he listens to General MacArthur speech as he awaits pick up. Production Television director Ron Winston made his feature debut with the film. It was also the motion picture debuts of then 19‚Äëyear‚Äëold Tisa Chang and Peter Masterson. Marine Lieutenant Colonel Clement J. Stadler also acted as a technical advisor for All the Young Men, Hell to Eternity, The Outsider, and The Lieutenant television series. A novelisation of the film's screenplay was written by Jack Pearl. During filming, Mickey Rooney became ill with a fever. While he was hospitalized in Manila, his wife Barbara Ann Thomason was killed by Milos Milos, her lover, in a murder-suicide.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?participantId=164893 Cast *Hugh O'Brian as First Sergeant Steve Corey *Mickey Rooney as Gunnery Sergeant Ernest Wartell *James Mitchum as Pvt James Grenier *Tisa Chang as Miyazaki *Peter Masterson as Platoon Sergeant William Maccone *Harry Lauter as Cpl.

The major part of the community, headed by metropolitan Moses G√∂rg√ºn, converted to the Old Calendarist (also called True Orthodox) tradition within Eastern Orthodoxy and in 2017, it was granted autonomy and jurisdiction over Germany and Europe. It is in full communion with the True Orthodox Metropolis of Ecuador and Latin America.Administration der Heiligen Hierachischen Syode der Genuin Orthodoxen Kirche History Metropolitan Moses G√∂rg√ºn, while he was Oriental Orthodox hierarch (2009) The origins of the church began in 2006, in the renunciation of the Syriac Orthodox Church by the priest Moses G√∂rg√ºn and two monks, P. Isa Oygur and John P. Budak, due to disagreements with the Archbishop of Central Europe, Mor Julius Yeshu Cicek, whilst at the Monastery of Mor Ephrem in the Netherlands. The group requested that the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church establish a diocese in Europe and subsequently travelled to India to discuss the matter with the church. Their situation was considered during a synod in August 2007 and due to disagreements little progress was made towards responding to the matter. However, on November 21 of the same year, Moses G√∂rg√ºn was consecrated metropolitan bishop of Europe in Thrissur by Bishop Yuhanon Mar Meletius of Thrissur and Bishop Thomas Mar Athanasius of Kandanad with the support of Bishop Thomas Mar Makarios of Europe, UK and Canada, upon which he assumed the name, Mor Severius Moses G√∂rg√ºn.Rabban Mushe G√∂rg√ºn Consecrated Metropolitan of The Syrian Orthodox Archdiocese of Europe On December 5, the Syriac Orthodox Church excommunicated Mor Severius Moses G√∂rg√ºn and his supporters.Syriac Orthodox Resources: Excommunicating Mushe Gorgun The consecration was recognised by the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church on December 7 after an episcopal synod was convened by the Primate of the church, Baselios Thoma Didymos I, who heard and accepted Yuhanon Mar Meletius and Thomas Mar Athanasius' reasons for consecrating Mor Severius Moses G√∂rg√ºn without the consent of the synod.The Hindu: Synod approves consecration On March 16, 2009, the synod of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church elevated the archdiocese to the status of autocephaly and was granted the name of the Syrian Orthodox Church of Europe; Mor Severius Moses G√∂rg√ºn was appointed as Primate and Metropolitan of the church. In May, the jurisdiction of the church was confirmed to be restricted to Europe by the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, and that the church had no jurisdiction over the church in India. Despite this, on March 21, 2010, Mor Severius Moses G√∂rg√ºn consecrated Mor Bartholomaos Joseph as metropolitan bishop of Angamaly, a diocese within the jurisdiction of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.Indian Orthodox Herald: Mor Severius Moses Gurgan Consecrates a Malayalee Metropolitan for Ankamaly As a result of this infringement, Baselios Thoma Didymos I excommunicated Mor Severius Moses G√∂rg√ºn and withdrew his recognition of the church.Indian Orthodox Herald: Malankara Withdraws the Approval and Acceptance of Mor Severius Moses Gorgun This led the church to change its name to reflect its presence outside of Europe and on April 28, 2010, the synod of the church changed the name of the church to the Antiochian Syrian Orthodox Church.Decree of Mor Severius Moses, Metropolitan and Primate of the Antiochian Syrian Orthodox Church Mor Severius Moses G√∂rg√ºn continued to ignore the wishes of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and on 17 June 2010 Mar Timotheos Yuhanon was consecrated bishop for Idukki and Mar Gregorios Mathews was consecrated bishop for Kottayam, dioceses within the jurisdiction of the church in India. The following year, however, to soothe relations with the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the synod of the Antiochian Syriac Orthodox Church choose to dissolve the dioceses of Idukki and Angamaly in September and their bishops stood down. In Spring 2012, the church began construction of the Monastery of St. Gabriel, near Altenbergen, Germany, and in August 2014, the monastery was consecrated and became the headquarters of the church. During the following years, metropolitan Moses G√∂rg√ºn established contacts with hierarchs of Eastern Orthodox Old Calendarist tradition. In 2016, metropolitan Moses G√∂rg√ºn joined the True Orthodox tradition within the Eastern Orthodoxy, and reorganized the community into an autonomous archdiocese.

He was known for living a humble lifestyle despite his great wealth. His example was the foundation for the modern Rifai Sufi Order.... Early life When Ahmad was seven years old, his father Sultan Ali died in Baghdad. From then on his maternal uncle Mansur ar-Rabbani el-Betaihi took him into his care and educated him. Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i learned the Qur‚Äôan from Shaykh Abd as-Semi el-Hurbuni in Hasen, where he was born, and by the age of seven he had committed it all to memory. (The title Shaykh before a name indicates a sufi teacher.) That same year, after Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i's father died, his maternal uncle Mansur el-Betaihi moved with his family to the region of Dikla. There he sent his nephew to Ebul Fadl Ali el-Vasiti, who was an expert in the canon law of Islam, a commentator on the Qur‚Äôan, and a great preacher. In addition to attending the dhikr meetings of his uncle, Shaykh Mansur ar-Rabbani, Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i also attended the courses of his other uncle, Shaykh Ebubekir, who was a great scientist of his era and the sultan of scientists. He eventually memorized the book Tenbih, which deals with the fikih (Muslim canonical jurisprudence) of Safi according to Imam Ebu Ishak Sirazi, and wrote an explanation about the book. (This explanation was lost in the Mongol invasion.) He occupied all his time with acquiring religious knowledge. Eventually even his own teachers and the people who taught him respect learned the essence of respect when they were in his presence. Graduation and Teaching When Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i was twenty years old, Ebu Fadl Ali, who was the Shaykh of Wasit province and his teacher, awarded him a sehadetname (teaching certificate) encompassing the sciences of canon law and permission to initiate a dervish order, gave him the name \\"father of external and interior sciences,\\" and dressed him with his own dervish's cloak. His teachers and his shaykhs agreed about the greatness of his rank and the superiority of his worth. Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i remained in Nehr-i Dikla for a short time and after that went back to his father's guest house for travelers in Hasen. He then became very well known. When he was twenty-eight, his uncle Shaykh Mansur requested that he led the dervish lodge and Caliphs after him. He also instructed him to live in the dervish lodge of Shaykh Yahya en- Neccari, who was his grandfather from his mother's side. Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i took up his post (shaykhship) there as an enlightened master and began teaching in this dervish lodge. His uncle died in the same year. By the time Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i reached the age of thirty-five, his murids (disciples) numbered over seven hundred thousand. Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i taught the Sunnah (the way of the Prophet Muhammad ) and the details of the Qur‚Äôan to the public, and he always said that the trade of a wise man is to show the way that leads to Allah and to direct hearts towards Allah. He held courses on hadith, Islamic canon law, religious precepts, and commentary on the Qur‚Äôan on all days of the week except Mondays and Thursdays. He sat in his pulpit on Monday and Thursday afternoons and preached to intellectuals and the general public. Because of the depth and the influence of his words, the people were captivated, their intelligence was stupefied, and their hearts submitted to him. Apart from the Prophet Muhammad, the companions and disciples of the Prophet and twelve Imams, there was no other person who spoke as well as Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i did. Whenever he sat in his pulpit to give a lecture, crowds‚Äìincluding advanced scientists, preachers, spiritual teachers and the general public‚Äìgathered. When he began to speak, knowledge gushed out with his words like the gushing sea. Wise men were enraptured when they heard his beautiful and influential words and listened to his extensive knowledge. The denying and obstinate were tongue-tied in the presence of the power of the evidence. Literary men profited from his outstanding expression, scientists from his skills and talents and philosophers from his deep and wise manner of speaking. In his book Sevad ul-Ayneyn, the writer Imam Rafii narrates, \\"Shaykh Salih Yusuf Ebu Zekeriya el-Askalani, who was a great expert in the canon law of Islam, told me: ‚ÄòI had gone to Ummi Abide to visit Shaykh Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i. There were more than one hundred thousand people around the guest house; some were managers, scientists and shaykhs, and the others were the normal public. He gave dinner to all of them and was very friendly to everyone. He started to preach in the afternoon of a Thursday. In the audience were preachers from the province of Vasit, as well as a religious community of doctors of Muslim theology of Iraq and the important people of the province. One group asked questions about the science of commentary on the Qur‚Äôan, another asked about subjects dealing with the recorded sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, another asked about Muslim canon jurisprudence, another asked about the disagreements between the different religious opinions, and yet another group asked many questions about different areas of science. Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i answered more than two hundred questions, and he did not get angry when he was answering the questions. I became embarrassed because of the insensitivity of people asking the questions, and I stood up and said, \\"Is this not enough for you? He can answer every question about the written sciences, without facing any difficulty, with the permission of Allah!\\" Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i smiled at my words and said, \\"Ebu Zekeriya, allow them to ask before I pass away. Certainly the world is a house from which we will all depart. Allah changes all situations, all of the time.\\" All the public cried at this answer. The crowd was perplexed and anxious exclamations were heard. Forty thousand people became his students because of the spiritual effect of his talk.‚Äô\\" Ahmad ar- Rif√¢i's talks, his actions, his behavior and his every breath were for Allah. He always had a smiling face, was modest and good-tempered, endured suffering, and was very patient. He did not get personally cross with anyone, and did not want any help for his own person. On the contrary, he loved for Allah, and even his anger was from Allah and for Allah. He did not rebuke anybody who behaved in a manner that he did not like. He considered neither his family nor himself superior to other people. Speaking about this he said, \\"According to our opinion of Allah, everybody is equal to everybody else: it doesn‚Äôt matter if they are close relatives or if they are strangers to us.\\" ReferencesExternal links *International Rifai Sufi Order *Sayyid Ahmad Kabeer Category:Iraqi Sufis Category:1182 deaths Category:1119 births ahmed kabir son . 1.

Life and career The Fair Persian (1916) Frederic William Henry Myers Wontner was born in Stockwell, Surrey, the son of noted architect, designer and renderer William Hoff Wontner (1814‚Äì1881) and Catherine Smith. William received his earliest art education from his father. Under his father's direction, Wontner worked with John William Godward (1861‚Äì1922), a noted exponent of what became known as Greco-Roman style, who was an acquaintance of the Wotner family. Swanson, V.G., John William Godward: The Eclipse of Classicism, Antique Collector's Club, 1997, p. 23 Godward was five years older than Wotner, and the pair became great friends. Wontner began teaching at St Johns Wood Art School in around 1885 after he moved to Hamilton Garden Square. Swanson, V.G., John William Godward: The Eclipse of Classicism, Antique Collector's Club, 1997, p. 26 Wontner was a relatively minor painter who was part of the neo-classical movement in England, led by Alma-Tadema. His style favoured seductively languorous women against classical or oriental marbled backdrops. Thornton, L., Women as Portrayed in Orientalist Painting, ACR edition, 1994. pp 120-121 His faithfully rendered fabrics draped over patently European models, somehow created an air of Orientalism. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1879, at the Society of British Artists and at the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. When the Grosvenor Gallery closed in 1890, Wontner exhibited at the New Gallery. Wontner married Jessie Marguerite Keene (1872‚Äì1950), daughter of Charles Joseph Keene, on 7 June 1894 at St. Dominic's Priory Church, Naverstock Hill in Hampstead. The couple had no children.

Photograph from a newspaper ad for Charles L. Fleischmann's yeast. thumb Otto Kalischer (April 23, 1869 in Berlin ‚Äì August 14, 1942 in Berlin) was a German anatomist and neurologist. Life He was born in 1869 as the son of physician Adolf Kalischer (1833‚Äì1893) and his wife Clara n√©e Franck, (1833-after 1921). He had brother Georg (1873‚Äì1938) and sister Else. His cousin Siegfried Kalischer (1862‚Äì1954) was neurologist too.Paul Kalisch: Nachtrag zu ‚ÄûDie Familie Kalischer\\". In: Arthur Czellitzer (ed.): J√ºdische Familien-Forschung 4, 35-37, pp. 737-740 (1934) He studied medicine in Freiburg im Breisgau and wrote his doctoral dissertation \\"√úber die Nierenver√§nderungen bei Scharlach\\" in 1891. Afterwards he was active as Assistantarzt (resident) in Hanau.Wetterauische Gesellschaft f√ºr die gesammte Naturkunde zu Hanau a. M.: Bericht ueber den Zeitraum vom 1. December 1892 bis 30. April 1895. Hanau 1895, page III. From 1895 he worked in Anatomischen Institut in Berlin under Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer (1836‚Äì1921). According to the List of German Jews in German Bundesarchiv, Otto Kalischer perished in Berlin on August 14, 1942, by his own hand. Research and controversy In 1900, Kalischer published a monograph \\"Die Urogenitalmuskulatur des Dammes mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung des Harnblasenverschlusses\\" (\\"The urogenital musculature of the perineum with special regards to the closure of the urinary bladder\\").Kalischer O. Die Urogenitalmuskulatur des Dammes mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung des Harnblasenverschlusses. S. Karger, Berlin 1900 He undertook very careful anatomical investigation of urogenital muscles by means of continuous serial sections, and described these structures in great detail. He stated, that the internal sphincter consists of trigonal muscle and no detrusor urinae muscle.John A. Hutch: Anatomy and physiology of the bladder, trigone, and urethra. Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1972 page 4 Kalischer coined the term musculus sphincter urogenitalis for the skeletal urethral sphincter and introduced the concept of the trigonal sphincter (the extension of the deep trigone). His work is cited even today in medical publications. Between 1900 and 1905, he published series of works on the neuroanatomy of birds.Kalischer O. Ueber Gro√ühirnextirpationen bei Papageien.

Preuss Akad Wiss Berl Berlin 1905, 4¬∞, 105 pp. He searched for brain sites related to avian vocal behavior and performed both left and bilateral hemisphere lesions on sixty Amazon parrots. He placed these lesions on the lateral surface of the brain, an area that he thought would be homologous to the temporal lobe (and Broca area) of humans. In following stimulation experiments he observed the movements of legs, jaw, and eyelids. It has been estimated retrospectively, that Kalischer‚Äôs lesions probably damaged both robust nucleus of archistriatum (RA) and the hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudalis (HVc). Kalischer postulated a pyramidal tract in birds. He was also among the first to prove that striatal rather than cortical areas are involved in avian intelligenceIrene Maxine Pepperberg: The Alex Studies: Cognitive and Communicative Abilities of Grey Parrots. Harvard University Press, 2002 During his career, he collaborated with Max Lewandowsky (1876‚Äì1918) (they wrote together a report of the disappearance of contralateral thermosensitivity after spinal cord hemisection in the dog), Louis Jacobsohn- Lask (1863‚Äì1941) and Max Rothmann (1868‚Äì1915).Ulrike Eisenberg.

Dem Andenken an Max Lewandowsky Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie. 51, 1 (1919). During the February 21, 1907 meeting of the Physical-Mathematical Section of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Kalischer reported some experiments which he had carried on for the purpose of testing the relation between the temporal cortex and tone-perception in dogs.Kalischer O. Zur Funktion des Schl√§fenlappens des Grosshirns. Eine neue H√∂rpr√ºfungsmethode bei Hunden; zugleich ein Beitrag zur Dressur als physiologischer Untrsuchungsmethode. Sitzungsberichte d Kgl Akad d Wissenschaft X (1907) He purposed particularly to test experimentally the earlier conclusion of Hermann Munk regarding the function of this area. Munk proved that the canine centre for tone is placed in the temporal lobe and perception of the high tones is conditioned by the function of the anterior part of the centre, while that of the deeper tones depends on the activity of the posterior region. Kalischer trained his dogs to take food upon the sounding of a given tone and to refrain from seizing it upon the sounding of any other. The food was either held in the experimenter's hand before the dog or laid on a chair by which the experimenter stood. The tones were sounded first on the organ used by Munk, which contained nine pipes, the octaves from C1 to c7. Later he substituted the piano and still later the harmonium, finding the latter best suited to his purposes. The daily tests on each animal were arranged about as follows: Kalischer struck a certain tone and as long as it sounded fed the animal bits of meat from the hand. In the first two daily experiments he sounded only the one food-tone, so that he might accustom the animal to being fed at the sound. The daily test on each animal lasted not longer than five or six minutes. Kalischer attempted two control-tests. He made some of his dogs temporarily blind, by sewing their eyelids together and reported, that the accuracy of discrimination was not affected. He also destroyed one cochlea in some other \\"well-trained dogs\\", and also reported no disturbance. When the other cochlea was destroyed, all discrimination ceased. Dogs subjected to extirpation of both cochlea before any training was attempted did not learn to discriminate at all. Kalischer regarded this as evidence that the other dogs had ignored extraauditory stimuli. Harry Miles Johnson in 1913 criticised Kalischer's procedure for the design of experiment and incomplete data presented. He wrote: > \\"Kalischer does not tell us how many trials he gave the animals at each > daily test, nor how many trials altogether were required to achieve > perfection. Data on both of these questions are highly desirable in reports > of behavior experiments (...) It would have been much better if Kalischer > had applied some form of control tests with the experimenter and others as > well out of the roomJohnson HM. Audition and Habit Formation in the Dog. > Behavior Monographs 2, 3 (1913)\\". The heaviest criticism came from George Windholz (1931‚Äì2002) in 1993.Windholz G, Lamal PA. Vagaries of science; priority, independent discovery, and the quest for recognition. The Psychological record 43, 3, p. 339-350 (1993) He stated that Kalischer was evidently influenced by the research of the Pavlovians on the conditioned reflex method. He cited Maiorov who maintained that Kalischer and Georg Friedrich Nicolai were coworkers.Maiorov FP. Istoriia ucheniia ob uslovnykh refleksakh [The history of the teaching on conditioned reflexes]. Moscow, Leningrad: Izdatel'stvo Akademii Nauk SSSR, 1954. As cited in Windholz, 1993 He summarized his article as follows: > \\"When Kalischer initially described the Dressur method [...] he, by failing > to refer to the work of Graber, Lubbock, Thorndike, and Himstedt, assigned > to himself the priority for the discovery of the discrimination method. > [...] [H]e should have acknowledged that the sensory discrimination method > had been used by fellow German scientists Graber and Himstedt. [...] > Apparently Kalischer convinced himself of having discovered a new sensory > discrimination method, the Dressur. [...] Kalischer might have been so > impressed by his presumed discovery that he became insensitive to the need > to acknowledge the work of other researchers who contributed to the > discovery of discrimination. Kalischer must have blinded himself by his > desire for priority in the discovery of this method. However, even given the > murky situation with respect to discrimination, it becomes obvious that > priority does not go to Kalischer. Rather, in our view, priority should be > awarded to Graber, who outlined the sensory discrimination experimental > design, and to Thorndike, who followed this design\\".

Looney Tunes short starring the Goofy Gophers along with an unnamed dog who is based on stage/film actor John Barrymore. The cartoon was planned by Arthur Davis, but was finished and directed by Robert McKimson. It was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on December 31, 1949, but some sources list the release date as December 13, 1949. The cartoon draws heavily from the works of William Shakespeare, with its gags relying on literal interpretations of lines from Hamlet, Julius Caesar, Richard III, and Romeo and Juliet. A Ham in a Role would be the last cartoon in the Golden Age of American Animation to star the dog that had opposed the Gophers in their first two appearances (he would be recycled for a single short in the 1990s in the World Premiere Toons series). Plot An anthropomorphic dog is tired of appearing in cartoons and goes home to study the works of Shakespeare. Upon arriving back home, the dog finds that his home has been invaded by gophers. Unfazed, the dog then begins reading Hamlet. Upon discovering the Goofy Gophers sleeping in the book, he throws the book out the window. The Goofy Gophers then decide to get back at the dog by literally interpreting lines from Shakespeare's works, including \\"lending him ears\\", by rolling a curtain up to annoy him, tormenting him with flames (to his foot), dousing him with \\"the joy of life\\" (by dumping a tub of water into the dog), dumping limburger cheese as the dog utters the \\"that which we call a rose by any other name\\" line while holding a rose, imitating the exhumed Yorick in a dance (making the dog appear like a Shakespearean coward), using magnets on the floor and ceiling to toss and carry the dog around the room (in armor), with the coup de gr√¢ce coming about when the Gophers use a horse to kick the dog out of his house, after he says \\"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!\\" and back to the studio, where the dog decides to finish what he started. Notes This cartoon was originally issued as a Looney Tunes cartoon with the Looney Tunes music. When it was re-issued in 1959, the cartoon was re-issued with Merrie Melodies credits, but retained the Looney Tunes music. Arthur Davis was originally slated to direct the short, however the short was left unfinished due to the dissolving of his unit during the shorts production (voice recording took place in November 1947, the same time Davis‚Äô unit was in the process of being dissolved). Bob McKimson was able to finish the short by 1949, as well as inheriting two of Davis‚Äô animators, Bill Mel√©ndez and Emery Hawkins.

Early life and education He was born in Montreal and he studied Psychology at the University of Victoria. Between 1973 and 1974 he drew weekly comics for the student newspaper. After completing his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974 he moved to Vancouver. He lived in London, England from 1983 to 1989. He received a Master of Science degree in Interactive Art and Technology from Simon Fraser University, Surrey in 2004. 3D holograms In 1976, he became the holography assistant for the American new media artist Al Razutis. In 1978 he received Canadian government funding to build his own holography studio and study holographic special effects. He exhibited the results of this work in Vancouver at the Helen Pitt Gallery in June 1978 and again in Victoria at the Open Space Gallery in June 1979. Freeze-dried sculptures In an attempt to solve a holographic problem, Gibson experimented with freeze-drying techniques. He produced a series of sculptures that explored the ethics of using legally embalmed animals and humans as art supplies. These sculptures were first exhibited at the Unit/Pitt Gallery in Vancouver, Canada in 1981. The same works were later shown in November 1984 at the Cuts Gallery in London, UK. =Fetus earrings= During the 1984 exhibition of freeze-dried sculptures in London, Gibson was given two dehydrated human fetuses from an anatomy professor. They were 10 weeks in development and had been dehydrated for 20 years. Gibson re-hydrated both fetuses, freeze-dried them and attached them as earrings to a female mannequin head. The sculpture was titled Human Earrings. They were exhibited at the Young Unknowns Gallery in south London in December 1987. On Thursday, 3 December 1987, the sculpture was seized by the Metropolitan Police. Because of this incident, Gibson was expelled from Goldsmiths College on 21 December 1987, where he was studying post-graduate art, design and technology. On 11 April 1988, Gibson and the gallery owner, Peter Sylveire, were formally charged with the common law offences of exhibiting a public nuisance and outraging public decency. The trial started on Monday, 30 January 1989 at the Old Bailey in central London. The judge was Brian Smedley, Michael Worsley was the prosecuting barrister, and Geoffrey Robertson and Francis Irwin were the defence barristers. On 6 February 1989, the charge of public nuisance was dismissed. On Tuesday, 9 February 1989, the jury of 10 women and 2 men found Gibson and Sylveire guilty of outraging public decency. Gibson was fined ¬£500 and Sylveire was fined ¬£300. Immediately following the verdict, an appeal application was filed. However, on 10 July 1990, the Court of Appeal dismissed the case and upheld the earlier conviction.R v Gibson and another. Court of Appeal, Criminal Division.[1991] 1 All ER 439, [1990] 2 QB 619, [1990] 3 WLR 595, [1990] Crim LR 738, 91 Cr App Rep 341, 155 JP 126. There was considerable media commentary about this sculpture before, during, and after the trial. The court case was also the subject of a one-hour British television programme. Since the trial, writers such as John A. Walker and Eduardo Kac have continued to reflect on the sculpture and its social implications. Performance art While living in London, Gibson met many performance artists at the Brixton Artists Collective. He did his first performance piece in Reading on 4 January 1986. He walked on the High Street with a dog carrying a sign which said: \\"Wanted: legally preserved human limbs and human fetuses\\". He tried to do the same piece again in Brighton on 25 January 1986, but he was arrested and convicted of behaviour likely to cause a breach of the peace. Subsequent performance pieces included standing in front of the Director of Public Prosecutions office in London with a live rat in front of his face, enabling people to kill live insects in Plymouth (where he was arrested but released without charge), and questioning the killing of slugs in Vancouver, Canada. =Cannibalism= On 23 July 1988, Gibson ate the flesh of another person in public. Because England does not have a specific law against cannibalism, he legally ate a canap√© of donated human tonsils in Walthamstow High Street, London. A year later, on 15 April 1989, he publicly ate a slice of human testicle in Lewisham High Street, London. When he tried to eat another slice of human testicle at the Pitt International Galleries in Vancouver on 14 July 1989, the Vancouver police confiscated the testicle hors d'≈ìuvre. However, the charge of publicly exhibiting it was dropped and he finally ate the piece of human testicle on the steps of the Vancouver court house on 22 September 1989. =Sniffy the rat= On 28 December 1989, The Province newspaper in Vancouver, Canada, reported that Gibson intended to crush a rat named Sniffy between two paint canvasses with a 25 kilogram concrete block in downtown Vancouver. On impact, Sniffy would leave an imprint on the canvasses, forming a diptych. Gibson said he had acquired Sniffy from a pet shop which sold living rats as food for snakes and lizards. The performance was planned to happen on 6 January 1990, outside the old central public library on Burrard Street. Opinion about the impending event was publicly broadcast via newsprint, television, and radio. On the morning of 6 January, a group of animal rights activists from the Lifeforce Foundation stole the device Gibson was going to use to crush the rat. Lifeforce's Peter Hamilton said that it was done to protect both the rat and Gibson. Because of this development, Gibson arrived at the corner of Robson and Burrard at 1:00 pm without Sniffy or his art making device. He told a crowd of over 300 people that he had returned the rat to the pet shop from where he had rented it. He encouraged the crowd to go to the pet shop and rescue Sniffy before it was sold as snake food. He later told CBC that he had full intentions of killing the animals. As he tried to leave the area, Gibson was surrounded by activists. He, along with Susan Milne and Paddy Ryan, were chased up Burrard Street by a mob. The three of them escaped through the Hotel Vancouver. Later that day, Sniffy was purchased from the pet shop by Peter Hamilton of the Lifeforce Foundation. Immediately afterwards, cartoonists, writers, and the general public commented on the event. Numerous books have also made reference to it. Several television shows have also focused on it. For the tenth anniversary of the performance, Radix Theatre, under the direction of Andrew Laurenson, created the Sniffy the Rat bus tour. Outdoor installations While living in London, Gibson visited Grizedale Forest in the north of England, which is home to an assortment of outdoor sculptures. In 1992, he received funding from the British Columbia Ministry of Tourism to develop a similar project in the mountains near Vancouver. This project was carried out at the University of British Columbia Research Forest in Maple Ridge during the summer of 1992. After completing this project, he was hired as a curator for Artropolis ‚Äô93 in Vancouver. He managed the installation of fourteen site-specific installations in Stanley Park during October and November 1993. Following Artropolis, he was commissioned by the City of Vancouver to design and build four community bird feeders on the Woodland Drive Bridge. Later, he worked with Ed Varney as a public art consultant for the City of Vancouver. They developed the first public art process for the new Vancouver Public Library. Working closely with architect Moshe Safdie, they managed the installation of the Joseph Montague fountain and they established a public art endowment fund. They also wrote the first public art policy for the Vancouver Park Board. 3D computer graphics In 1996, Gibson received a research position at the Centre for Image and Sound Research at Simon Fraser University to study anaglyph images. He exhibited some of these images at the 1995 Currents exhibition in Vancouver and in Victoria, BC. In 1996, he built the world‚Äôs first completely anaglyphic website. Between 2002 and 2004, he studied 3D lenticular printing for his master's degree. By 2006 he was publicly showing autostereoscopic prints. In 2007 he had a major exhibition of this work at the 3D Center of Art and Photography in Portland, Oregon. In February 2011 he exhibited six large lenticular prints at the Blim Gallery in Vancouver, Canada. These prints paid homage to six renowned religious leaders by revealing the penis of God within them. Bioart He gave a talk to the International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ) at Cambridge University in July 2012 about the use of live insects in art and entertainment. On 8 February 2017 Gibson walked naked in front of the Vancouver Law Courts in the middle of winter to protest Canada's ban of genetic engineering of the human genome. He walked nude in downtown Vancouver for 11 minutes, 45.75 seconds in a light rain and a temperature of 7 degrees Celsius.

At club level Gronow played under the union code for Bridgend RFC, county rugby for Glamorgan, and international rugby for Wales. He was often used as a utility forward.

The Official History Of Featherstone Rovers R.L.F.C.. Wakefield Express. ASIN: B00O1TLDPC while at representative level, Gronow played for Great Britain and Wales. His playing position varied under the league code being used as a goal-kicking forward (prior to the specialist positions of; ), during the era of contested scrums. Playing career While playing rugby union at Bridgend RFC, in 1910 Gronow won four caps for Wales. Gronow won eight caps for Wales under the league code, between 1910 and 1923 while playing for Huddersfield. Gronow was also capped for the Great Britain rugby league team while at Huddersfield, in 1911 against Australia (2 matches), and after being selected for the 1920 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia, against Australia (2 matches), and New Zealand (3 matches). Ben Gronow played as a forward, i.e. number 8, in Huddersfield's 2‚Äì8 defeat by Wakefield Trinity in the 1910 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1910‚Äì11 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 3 December 1910, played as a forward, i.e. number 10, and scored 4-goals in the 18‚Äì8 victory over Dewsbury in the 1919 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1918‚Äì19 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 17 May 1919, played as a forward, i.e. number 10, and scored 3-goals in the 24‚Äì5 victory over Leeds in the 1919 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1919‚Äì20 season at Thrum Hall, Halifax on Saturday 29 November 1919, and played as a forward, i.e. number 8, and scored a goal in the 4‚Äì10 defeat by Hull F.C. in the 1923 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1923‚Äì24 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 24 November 1923. Gronow also played at least one game for the Other Nationalities team, on 5 February 1921 against England. The game was notable for the Other Nationalities side being entirely composed of Welsh players; but despite approaches to have the game recognised as a 'Wales' v England encounter the rugby league authorities refused to accept the request. Gronow became one of less than twenty-five Welshmen to have scored more than 1000-points in their rugby league career.Robert Gate (1988). \\"Gone North ‚Äì Volume 2\\". R. E. Gate. Gronow was selected for Great Britain while at Huddersfield for the 1924 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, he did not play in any of the Test matches on this tour. In 1925 Gronow became the first British player to move down under when he went from Huddersfield to Grenfell, New South Wales as their coach but returned two years later. Ben Gronow made his d√©but for Featherstone Rovers on Wednesday 13 March 1929.Bailey, Ron (20 September 2001). Images of Sport - Featherstone Rovers Rugby League Football Club. The History Press. Ben Gronow appears to have scored no drop-goals (or field-goals as they are currently known in Australasia), but prior to the 1974‚Äì75 season all goals, whether; conversions, penalties, or drop-goals, scored 2-points, consequently prior to this date drop-goals were often not explicitly documented, therefore '0' drop-goals may indicate drop-goals not recorded, rather than no drop-goals scored. In addition, prior to the 1949‚Äì50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points. Coaching career Gronow was the coach for rugby union team Morley R.F.C. in the 1930s, however when a history of the club was produced some years later, due to his previous rugby league associations, he was identified as 'unknown' in a team photograph.David Lawrenson (2007). \\"The Rugby League Miscellany [Page-59]\\".

CPR opposes the broad outlines of President Obama's health care reform plan, and has hired Creative Response Concepts, a public relations firm which previously worked with the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.Conservative PR Firm That Repped Swift Boat Vets Now Helping Fight Sotomayor, The Washington Post Campaign Conservatives for Patients' Rights assert themselves as advocates for better health care. Their plan is described as the pillars of health care reform: \\"choice, competition, accountability and personal responsibility.\\"The Plans from the CPR website The CPR campaign for competition suggests a release of burdensome regulations against private companies in allowance of unfettered competition across the states. Scott said at that time of the CPR launch, \\"[When] the government gets involved, you run out of money and health care gets rationed.\\" Scott has created and starred in a series of commercials advocating against greater government involvement in health care. CPR-affiliated citizens have protested at town hall meetings on the issue. CPR has provided a list of local town hall meetings discussing the issue, which the group urge their supporters to attend and have provided video footage on how previous people have handled the situation.[Congressional Town Hall Meetings] from the CPR website.Fox News Coverage on Town Hall Meeting Criticism Some health policy analysts disagree with Scott, who called the Obama plan \\"socialized medicine.\\"Socialized Medicine Belittled on Campaign Trail from NPR.Health Care Realities from The New York Times In May 2009, the group Health Care for America Now (HCAN) started broadcasting an advertisement in the Washington, D.C. area and in Scott's home town of Naples, Florida, highlighting a fraud case in which Scott was indicted.New TV Ad Exposes Health Reform Critic‚Äôs Shady Past , Health Care for America Now HCAN said of Scott: \\"He and his insurance-company friends make millions from the broken system we have now.\\". In August 2009, Katie Brickell and Kate Spall, two British woman who featured in a CPR commercial attacking the National Health Service, said they were \\"duped\\" and the commercial misrepresents them because in reality they strongly support state-funded health care. Both told The Times newspaper that they had been told they were being interviewed for a documentary examining healthcare reform, and neither knew the footage would be used for such a commercial. The group was also criticized by economist Paul Krugman in a New York Times editorial.Paul Krugman, The Town Hall Mob, The New York Times. Stephen Barrett, the webmaster of alternative medicine-critical website Quackwatch, has criticized the group for its television spots, which it considers \\"misleading\\" and \\"scare tactics\\", stating: \\"Together, they claim that current efforts at reform will (a) drive up taxes, (b) stop people from being able to choose their doctors, (c) cause many people to lose their current insurance coverage, and (d) take medical decision-making out of the hands of doctors. All of these messages are misleading\\". Barrett also questions Scott's trustworthiness for being entrusted with influence in healthcare system reform, as the latter was involved in the largest case of Medicare fraud and had run-ins with the Federal Trade Commission, who accused a hospital chain of which he was CEO of anti-competitive misconduct, and he also invested in a producer of food supplements which Barrett states implies in its advertisement that its products can cure various diseases when such promotion is in fact illegal according to Federal law.

In the , South Wellesley Islands had a population of 0 people.

The Kayardild language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Mornington Shire Council. Sometime around 1916, a man remembered only as McKenzie came to Bentinck Island and set up a sheep run, basing himself on a site at the mouth of the Kurumnbali estuary. He would ride over the island, accompanied by a pack of dogs, and shoot any Kaiadilt man who came within sight; in local memory, he murdered at least 11 people. He also kidnapped and raped native girls. He then moved to Sweers Island, and set up a lime kiln there. The Kaiadilt managed to return to Sweers only on McKenzie's departure. The massacre was only recorded by researchers in the 1980s. Sweers Island was declared an Aboriginal reserve in 1934. After a cyclonic tidal surge swept the area in 1948, which followed fast on the severe drought that struck in 1946, the Kaiadilt were transferred by missionaries and the Queensland Government to Mornington Island. The uprooting effectively set in place the process of the destruction of both Kaiadilt culture and language since all children were restricted to dormitories, away from their parents and kin, and the transmission of the language and lore was lost. On Mornington Island they lived in a separate zone, in beach humpies facing Bentinck Island. They were looked down on by the Indigenous Lardil people, who denied them access to the fishing grounds. Conditions were so severe that for several years all children were stillborn, creating a gap in the generations. From the late 1960s onwards, the Kaiadilt began to return to their own islands.[citation needed] References Category:Islands of Queensland Category:North West Queensland Category:Gulf of Carpentaria Category:Shire of Mornington (Queensland) Category:Massacres of ethnic groups Category:Localities in Queensland ","title":"South Wellesley Islands"},{"id":"22787361","text":"Karima Francis (born Karima Antoinette Francis Cunliffe, 28 April 1987 in Blackpool, England) is an English singer-songwriter.
