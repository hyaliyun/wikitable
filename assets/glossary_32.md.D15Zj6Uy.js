World Bowl '97 was won by the Barcelona Dragons, whose quarterback was Jon Kitna, then on the roster of the Seattle Seahawks in the NFL. Season The Amsterdam Admirals moved their home games to the new Amsterdam ArenA. During the regular season the 7‚Äì3 Rhein Fire finished ahead of the 5‚Äì5 Barcelona Dragons in the standings. Barcelona, however, had had a 4‚Äì1 start to qualify for the World Bowl as midseason leaders, also gaining the right to host the World Bowl. In the second half of the season, with little to play for, Barcelona went 1‚Äì4. This was instrumental in a rule change for the following season, namely that the end-of-season league leader and runner-up would contest the World Bowl, not the midseason leader. In week 1 Frankfurt travelled to London and lost 14‚Äì7, suffering what Frankfurt's coach Ernie Stautner called \\"the worst game I've seen offensively in all the years I've been in football\\". In week 4 the Dragons beat London, who suffered the \\"most spectacular collapse in World League history\\" according to Nick Halling, in giving away a 23-point lead. The Fire, with a 10‚Äì7 win in London on June 15, 1997, secured first place in the league as the only team with a winning record. World Bowl '97 Barcelona beat Rhein Fire 38‚Äì24 at the Estadi Ol√≠mpic de Montju√Øc in Barcelona, Spain on Sunday, June 22, 1997. World Bowl '97 was the fifth championship game of the World League of American Football. 31,100 fans were in attendance as the Dragons won their first and only World Bowl title in franchise history.

Photo was taken looking south from the Vilas Bridge; trees block a direct view of this set from the road along the shore. Two sets of petroglyphs at Bellows Falls, located 35 feet (11 m) and 55 feet (17 m) south of the bridge. Photo was taken looking south from the Vilas Bridge. The Bellows Falls Petroglyph Site (designated Site VT-WD-8) is an archaeological site containing panels of precontact Native American petroglyphs in Bellows Falls, Vermont. Located near the Vilas Bridge on bedrock west of and above the Connecticut River, they depict a rarely-seen assemblage of anthropomorphic figures that is believed to be unique in New England, and uncommon even in surrounding geographic areas. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description The petroglyph site is located on the east side of the Bellows Falls Island, south of the Vilas Bridge, which connects Bellows Falls and Walpole, New Hampshire, across the Connecticut River. There are two rock panels, located and south of the bridge. Each panel contains a series of figures interpreted as human heads, with mouths, eyes, and radiating projections. The abstract features of these heads are consistent with the traditional corn husk masks of the Abenaki and Iriquois peoples, and a similar inscription was discovered in 2015 along the banks of the West River in Brattleboro. The southern panel, about long, has eight figures, and the northern panel, about long, has sixteen. Other archaeological sites are located in the general area, but their association to this site is not known. It is known that additional panels may be protected by riprap laid along the river bank; these panels are also sometimes protected from occasional vandalism by silt deposited by the river. The existence of these figures has been known and commented on since the late 18th century. Similar figures are rare in New England, but instances of similar figures have been identified in Pennsylvania and Canada from the Great Lakes east. Because of their rarity, they provide an unusual opportunity to establish prehistoric cultural connections between relatively disparate regions.

The first barons of Bannockburn were from the Sandilands and Vere families, descendants of a man named James who around 1348 had been granted the territory of Sandilands, Lesmahagow Lanarkshire, taking the territorial name as his surname. He was also later granted the barony of Calder near Edinburgh. The link of the Sandilands to Bannockburn was established on 14 July 1489, when King James IV confirmed James Sandelands of Calder and his wife Margaret Kerr his wife in the lands of Bannockburn.Register of the Great Seal of Scotland II.1879 By 7 July 1509, James Calder had transferred Bannockburn to his son. On that date, King James IV confirmed a charter by Sir James Sandelands of Calder granting various lands including the barony of Ouchterbannok alias Bannockburn to his son James Sandelands.Register of the Great Seal of Scotland II.3363 On 23 August 1510, King James IV granted Sir James Sandelands of Caldour (nephew of Sir James Sandelands and his wife Mariota Forrester), various lands including the lands and barony of Bannockburn. Robert De Vere the 6th. Earl of Oxford accompanied Edward the 2nd. on his campaign which culminated in defeat by the victorious King Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn on the 23rd and 24th of June 1314.

The Veres of Lesmahagow and Calder whose vast estates in Lanarkshire in the early 14th century encompassed that of their near relatives and neighbours the Sandilands are today represented by their descendants the Hope Vere Anderson family of Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire and New Abbey, Dumfries and Galloway.

Kees van der Staaij of the ultraconservative Protestant Reformed Political Party (SGP) asked parliamentary questions about the matter to Secretary of State of Transport Tineke Huizinga, and discussed the topic with Van den Berg on 28 January in Nova. However, the bus campaign was abandoned, because the major bus companies Connexxion, Arriva and Veolia do not allow messages of a political or religious nature. In January 2017, Floris participated in the EO television series Rot op met je religie (\\"To Hell With Your Religion\\"), in which he lives together with two Christians, a Muslim, a Jew and a fellow atheist for two weeks.

Early life and education John O. Crosby was born a slave in Crosbyville, Fairfield County, South Carolina on December 22, 1850 to Sylvian and her master, Thomas Crosby. His mother was from Richmond, Virginia. He was apprenticed to the carpenter's trade. In 1860, Thomas Crosby died and his estate was sold. Mary Q. Crosby purchased Crosby for $1,260. In 1864, Mary Crosby married William Stanton, and Crosby's apprenticeship ended and he moved to Shelton's Depot. Stanton was drafted into the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War in 1864, and John went along. Stanton was assigned duty as a guard of a prison for Federal soldiers in Florence, South Carolina, near Columbia. Stanton was friends with Robert Stark Means, commander of the prison, and Stanton was made suttler to the prisoners. Crosby's proximity to headquarters gave him the chance to occasionally act as drummer. Crosby was well liked, and used his privileges to occasionally help Federal prisoner's escape and to give to the prisoner's reports about Confederate movements.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p422-425 After the war, Crosby endeavored to gain an education. He joined the Union League and became involved with county politics. In 1869, he was appointed by governor Robert Kingston Scott as census taker. He entered Biddle University in the fall of 1869 and Shaw University in 1870, graduating in 1874 with a degree in theology. He later became the first African-American man to graduate from the National School of Elocution and Oratory. Career In 1874 he was ordained and became the minister for the first Colored Baptist church of Warrenton, North Carolina. In 1875, he was elected delegate from Warren County, North Carolina to the North Carolina State Constitutional Convention. In 1880 he moved to the Dixonville Baptist church in Salisbury, North Carolina and became principal of the State Colored Normal School, a college for training teachers, in that city.

It was released in March 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Unlike the previous games in the Battlefield series, Hardline focuses on crime, heist and policing elements instead of military warfare. Upon release, the game received a mixed critical reception, with critics praising the game's multiplayer mode, accessibility and voice acting, while criticizing the game's plot, stealth and narrative. It is the final Battlefield game to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It was also the last game to be developed by Visceral Games before the company shut down in 2017. Gameplay The focus of the game is the \\"war on crime\\", breaking away from the military setting that characterized the series. As such, the main factions in Hardline are the police Special Response Units and criminals. Players have access to various military-grade weapons and vehicles, such as the Lenco BearCat, as well as having police equipment such as tasers and handcuffs. Hardline also uses the \\"Levolution\\" mechanic from Battlefield 4. For example, in the map \\"Downtown\\" players can send a construction crane crashing into the building, ripping down debris from the central buildings in downtown, which falls down on the streets of Los Angeles. This time, every map features multiple Levolution events, both small and large. Many new game modes are featured in Hardline, including \\"Heist\\", \\"Rescue\\", \\"Hotwire\\", \\"Blood Money\\", and \\"Crosshair\\" Mode. * Heist: The criminals must break into a cash filled vault (or as featured in some maps, blow open the doors of an armoured truck) then move the cash filled packages to an extraction point; the police must stop them. If the Criminals manage to escape by bringing all the money to the extraction point, they win. * Blood Money: Both factions must retrieve money from an open crate in the center of the map, then move it back to their respective side's armored truck. Players can also steal money from the opposing team's truck. The team that first deposits $5 million worth of money into their truck or the team with the most money under a time limit wins. * Hotwire: Drivable cars take the role of traditional Conquest \\"flags\\". Like Conquest, capturing cars (done by driving above a certain \\"cruising\\" speed) will bleed the enemy team's reinforcement tickets. The team who reduces the other's to zero or who has the most tickets remaining after the time limit wins. * Rescue: In a 3 minute long 5 vs 5 competitive mode, S.W.A.T. officers must try to rescue hostages held by criminal forces. The cops win by either rescuing the hostage(s) or by killing all the criminals. Criminals win by killing all the cops, or defending the hostages until the negotiations are over. Each player has only one life in this mode, which means no respawns. * Crosshair: The second competitive game mode in Battlefield Hardline. Crosshair is also 3 minutes long, 5 vs 5 with only one life. In Crosshair the criminals are trying to kill a player controlled VIP on the cops side who is a former gang member turned states witness. The criminals win by killing the VIP and the cops win by getting the VIP to the extraction point. Visceral Games ratified that the single-player campaign will not be linear and promised to deliver a better one than the predecessors. The campaign features episodic crime dramas where choices will change situational outcomes and gameplay experiences. As a cop, players can use multiple police gadgets and personal equipments. The police badge can be used in ordering criminals to lay down their weapons, the scanner is used to stake out a situation, identify high- value targets, log evidences, tag alarms, and mark other threats. To slip past unnoticed, players can use bullet cases to distract enemies. Synopsis =Setting= Miami is embroiled in a drug war and Officer Nick Mendoza (voiced by Philip Anthony-Rodriguez, motion captured by Nicholas Gonzalez) has just made detective. Alongside his partner, veteran detective Khai Minh Dao (Kelly Hu), he follows the drug supply chain from the streets to the source. In a series of increasingly off-the-books cases, the two detectives come to realize that power and corruption can affect both sides of the law. =Plot= In 2012, Miami Police Detectives Nick Mendoza and Carl Stoddard (Travis Willingham) make a drug bust that goes violent. After arresting a fleeing suspect, Captain Julian Dawes (Benito Martinez) has Nick partner up with Khai Minh Dao (Kelly Hu) to follow a lead to cocaine broker Tyson Latchford (Adam J. Harrington). Forcing his associate to wear a wire, they find a new drug called Hot Shot being sold in the streets of Miami and rescue Tyson from a group of armed men. In the process Khai is severely wounded, putting her out of action for several weeks. After returning (against her doctor's orders), Dawes orders the two to bring in Leo Ray (Graham Shiels) from the Elmore Hotel but are forced to fight their way through armed men connected to drug dealer Remy Neltz (T.J. Storm), who is distributing the Hot Shot drug. While capturing Leo, Khai beats him up for seemingly insulting her. Leo's information leads the two detectives to the Everglades, where drug bales are being dropped. Investigating the area, they discover several of Neltz's drug operations and Leo's mutilated corpse, who was presumably killed for cooperating with the Miami Police. They eventually find Neltz only to escape back to Miami. Before leaving, he mentions that he took a deal from Stoddard. The officers corner him in a Miami warehouse only for Stoddard to kill Neltz as he was about to elaborate more on their deal. Nick leaves in disgust after Stoddard and Khai take some cash before more officers arrive. Later, as a hurricane makes landfall, Dawes sends Nick and Khai back to the crime scene for any evidence incriminating Stoddard. Finding Neltz's recording implicating Stoddard, Nick finds his former partner in a meeting with other dealers but is forced to work with him to rescue Khai from more armed men. The three later meet Dawes, who destroys the evidence implicating Stoddard and revealing that himself and Khai are corrupt. The three betray Nick due to his refusal to go along with their scheme, framing him for laundering Neltz's drug money. Three years later in 2015, while on a prison bus, Nick escapes with the help of Tap and Tyson. The mastermind behind Nick's escape is none other than Khai. Despite raw feelings about her betrayal and being framed, Nick leaves with Khai and Tyson for Los Angeles. Khai briefs Nick that during the three years he has been in prison, Dawes founded private law enforcement firm Preferred Outcomes, having 'cleaned up' Miami and is starting to expand into other US cities. Wanting to ruin Dawes, Khai sends Nick and Tyson to rendezvous with Marcus \\"Boomer\\" Boone (Eugene Byrd) and the three of them disrupt Korean Mafia leader Kang's drug business (Dawes' main drug distribution spot in LA). Although not finding much, Nick and Khai follow another lead to the house of drug kingpin Neil Roark (Mark Rolston). During Roark's meeting, Nick comes up with the idea to steal Dawes' money before he can launder it and uses Khai's phone as a makeshift tracking device by placing it in a briefcase to be taken to where the rest of Dawes's money is being kept. After surviving a brief assault by Roark's men, Nick and Khai make their escape. Discovering Dawes' money is kept in the penthouse of his corporate HQ skyscraper back in Miami and behind an impregnable vault, Boomer calls a former associate of his for a safecracking robot. He and Nick drive to the desert to meet Boomer's contact, his ex-girlfriend Dune (Alexandra Daddario), who sets up a meeting with her father, Tony Alpert (Fred Tatasciore). Alpert backstabs them, however, revealing he knows Nick is an escaped felon and that Stoddard has placed a bounty on him for his capture alive. Nick and Boomer escape their prison and retrieve their gear from Alpert's compound. Along the way, Nick discovers that Alpert was behind the creation and manufacturing of the Hot Shot drug, and murdered an ATF agent (Josh Keaton) to cover up his plans of starting a civil war. Dune helps the two escape to an abandoned airfield but separate after surviving Alpert's ambush at a gas station. At the airfield, Nick retrieves the safecracking robot and wins a tank duel against Alpert, before he and Boomer escape in a plane Boomer had repaired. As Khai, Nick, Boomer, and Tyson prepare to leave for Miami they are ambushed by Stoddard and his men. Nick kills his former partner and sends a picture of Stoddard's body to Dawes. The group arrive at Miami and infiltrate Preferred Outcomes HQ. They find the vault in Dawes' penthouse only to find it booby-trapped. Tyson is gravely wounded by the blast but survives. Nick answers Khai's ringing phone in the empty vault to hear Dawes on the other side, telling Nick to come find him at Santa Rosita off the coast of Florida. Nick departs from his group on the island, who leave to find medical attention for Tyson, and infiltrates it alone to Dawes's mansion. Nick finds his corrupt former captain in his office, where Dawes tells him that he wishes Nick to join him and take over Preferred Outcomes once Dawes is gone and that the two are akin to be \\"more criminal than cop\\". Nick agrees to the last remark and unhesitantly shoots Dawes dead. Searching his office, he finds a letter addressed to him from Dawes explaining why he framed Nick three years earlier and follows a passage to his underground vault. Inside the vault, Nick finds Dawes' laundered fortune, which is now his, left to wonder how he will use it. Development Battlefield Hardline was revealed on an EA blog post by vice president and general manager of Visceral Games, Steve Papoutsis. The game was due for announcement during E3 2014, but information was leaked early. Unlike other games in the Battlefield franchise that feature military warfare, Hardline features a \\"cops and robbers\\" gameplay style. The leaked trailer refers to the game as Omaha. \\"Visceral started work on Battlefield Hardline about a year before Dead Space 3 shipped,\\" creative director Ian Milham has revealed, suggesting that the game may have entered development in early 2012. On June 14, 2014, the Battlefield Hardline beta went public, coming after an official announcement at the 2014 Electronics Entertainment Expo that the beta would be coming soon to PC and PlayStation 4. The beta ended on June 26, 2014. During Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, EA confirmed that the game would be running at 1080p on the PlayStation 4 and was aiming to achieve the same resolution for the Xbox One version. However, on March 8, 2015, Visceral Games revealed that the PlayStation 4 version would only run at 900p, with the Xbox One version running at 720p. On February 3, 2015, the Battlefield Hardline beta became publicly active for all platforms. It was reported that 7 million people participated in the open beta and it was met with positive reception from both critics and players. On February 24, 2015, Electronic Arts confirmed that the game had been declared gold, indicating it was being prepared for production and release. Release On July 22, 2014, EA announced that they would delay Battlefield Hardline from October 21, 2014 to March 17, 2015. The reason for the delay was to implement the feedback given during the public beta. The Premium Edition of the game was announced on March 2, 2015. Players who purchased the Premium Edition will unlock several features, including masks, a Gun bench that allows player to customize their weapons and \\"Legendary Status\\", a feature relating to the progression system of the game. On the same day, the four expansion packs of the game, namely Criminal Activity, Robbery, Getaway, and Betrayal were announced. Similar to Battlefield 4's Premium Program, premium members of Hardline gained access to the four expansion packs two weeks before other players. Four new maps, as well as new vehicles, masks, and weapons were introduced to the game through the Criminal Activity DLC. According to the lead multiplayer producer Zach Mumbach, the pack would put more emphasis on \\"destructibility\\". A new game mode called \\"Bounty Hunter\\" is also featured. It was released in June 2015. The second expansion, Robbery, features a five-versus-five multiplayer modes called Squad Heist, new paints, weapons and \\"Legendary Super Feature\\". The expansion pack was released in September 2015. The third expansion, Getaway, which adds a new mode called \\"Capture the Bag\\" and new maps to the game, was released on January 12, 2016. The final expansion, Betrayal, was released in March 2016. Reception =Critical response= Battlefield Hardline received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Anthony LaBella from Game Revolution gave the game a 4/5, praising its stealth element, action-packed sequences, detailed single-player campaign, compelling and fast-paced multiplayer and the Heist mode, which requires players to utilize teamwork. He also praised the other new modes featured in the game such as Hotwire and Crosshair, which he stated \\"has showcased the transition from warfare to crime and provide plenty of entertainment outside of the traditional Battlefield experience\\". However, he criticized the predictable plot, flat characters, poor presentation of the campaign and the uninteresting story. He summarized the review by saying that \\"The combination of the stealth-focused campaign and many multiplayer modes establishes Battlefield Hardline as a worthwhile standalone entry in the popular FPS franchise.\\" Brian Albert from IGN gave the game an 8/10, praising its enjoyable campaign, surprising comedic moments, decent plot, voice-acting and animation, likeable characters, well-designed levels, realistic weapons and audio, rewarding stealth, as well as the single-player campaign for requiring the player to utilize patience and skill and the game for encouraging players to use non-lethal takedown. He also praised the huge variety of multiplayer modes, the dynamic Hotwire mode and the well-designed and varied maps. He also praised the new gameplay features such as the grappling hook and zip-line for making transversal faster. However, he criticized the unlock system for not awarding players in accordance to their playstyles and the overly-simplistic AI. He summarized the review by saying that \\"Battlefields first foray into stealth makes for a fresh campaign, and the multiplayer has something for everyone.\\" Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer gave the game an 8/10, saying that the single-player campaign \\"is a mess\\", and that its ending is \\"facepalm- worthy\\". However, he also said that the multiplayer mode is \\"still worthy of the Battlefield name\\". He summarized his review by saying that while the single-player campaign \\"falls flat, the heart of the Battlefield franchise beats on ‚Äì albeit at a different tempo\\". Ben Griffin from GamesRadar gave the game a 3.5/5, praising its new-players friendly and compelling multiplayer, refreshing multiplayer modes, rewarding interrogations system and detailed character models. However, he criticised the unfocused campaign, simplistic and predictable AI, as well as the campaign's over-reliance on stealth, which he stated \\"has never evolved during the campaign\\". He summarized the review by saying that \\"While not quite as main-event-essential as previous Battlefield blockbusters, the tighter, faster Hardline is most definitely the good cop.\\" Jeff Gerstmann from Giant Bomb gave the game a 3/5, praising its collectibles, which he stated \\"have actual context\\", he criticised the idiotic AI partners as well as the poor story which has failed to deliver character development, tension and logic. He summarized the review by saying that \\"Battlefield Hardline is hardly a disaster, but it feels like a franchise spinning its wheels with minor adjustments, rather than truly advancing forward.\\" He also noted that the game generally enjoyed a more stable launch than its predecessor Battlefield 4, as he stated that the game performs functionally across all platforms. Brett Phillips from VideoGamer.com strongly criticized the campaign, calling it \\"the worst campaign in the entire series\\". He also criticized its poorly-designed spawn points, unnecessary item-scanning, clich√©d twists, anarchic and inconsistent Conquest mode, boring and frustrating Hotwire mode, as well as the removal of heavy weapons such as rocket launcher from the weapon menu. The progression system was also criticized for being incongruous with the narrative of the game. He also criticized the map design for lacking imagination and verticality, matches for lasting too long and the game itself for not taking any risks. He called the game \\"a forgettable, immature experience rather than one worth talking about\\" and he summarized the review by saying that \\"Battlefield Hardline could have been something unique, a chance for Visceral to place its own stamp on a long- standing franchise. What we instead get is a laughably-shambolic campaign and multiplayer that is merely serviceable and too timid to step out of Battlefield 4s shadow.\\" One aspect of the game that was singled out by games media was a set of easter eggs: when reloading a gun, there is a one in 10000 chance that instead of the standard reload animation, a comically absurd animation will play, which the press called \\"hilarious\\" and \\"zany\\". =Sales= The retail version of Battlefield Hardline debuted at No. 1 in the UK software sales chart in its first launch week. It also became the best- selling title in the UK in 2015 as of March 23, 2015. According to NPD Group, the game was the best-selling game in March in the United States.

It was also released as the second single from the album, following up on the Top 20 hit \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,\\" after receiving significant airplay as an album track. The single was issued twice with two different B-sides, \\"Hymn\\" and \\"Nobody But You.\\" It did not achieve the same chart success as \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,\\" peaking at #67 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also charted on the Adult Contemporary chart in Canada, reaching #55. In some countries, such as in Europe, it was released as the B-side of the single release of \\"One Morning in May.\\" Lyrics and music Taylor said he had written \\"One Man Parade\\" during the year preceding the album release and he had begun playing it live in concert as early as the Fall of 1971. Like \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,\\" \\"One Man Parade\\" was recorded on a portable recording console at Taylor's home with his new bride Carly Simon in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Simon, Carole King and Abigale Haness provided harmony vocals, as do Taylor's siblings Alex, Kate and Hugh. Musicologist James Perone hears several Latin music elements in the song, including the instrumentation including congas, g√ºiro and timbales. Russ Kunkel plays the congas on the song, in a performance Taylor biographer Mark Robowsky describes as \\"trippy.\\" Perone also finds Latin dance music influences in the way the song uses harmonic and bass ostinato, and finds the coda section to be similar to a montuno section of certain Latin music pieces that use a canto-montuno structure. \\"One Man Parade\\" was originally intended to be the title track of the album, but Taylor changed the album title \\"for no particular reason\\" to One Man Dog, in reference to his shepherd dog who is mentioned in the song. To Robowsky, \\"One Man Parade\\" provides the theme for the album, calling it \\"a wistful desire to waste time on the simplest pleasures, walking a dog, pouring rain, checking out an occasional garbage can.\\" Although Robowsky calls the song \\"upbeat\\" and Taylor's \\"most carefree yet: he notes that Taylor undercuts that mood with the line \\"I'm right good at holding on, holding on, holding on.\\" Perone also notes that the lyrics are more \\"upbeat\\" than most Taylor songs of this era, with the singer announcing his readiness to \\"step out on the town.\\" Donald Langis of L'Evangeline praised the word play of the lines \\"All I want is a little dog to be walking at my right hand / talking 'bout a one man dog / Nobody's friend but mine.\\" Langis interprets the dog as a metaphor for the type of friend Taylor is seeking. Critical reception Billboard rated \\"One Man Parade\\" as one of Taylor's best songs ever, saying that it is \\"full of melodic surprises\\" and \\"lyrical weirdness.\\" It also noted that although the song is \\"rollicking\\" it fits within Taylor's brand of gentle pop music. Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau praises how the song \\"starts right in and never lets up,\\" and also praises Taylor's vocal performance for sounding like he was \\"standing while singing for the very first time. Langis believed it had potential to be a hit. Several reviewers praised Taylor's live performances of the song in the early 1970s. \\"One Man Parade\\" was included on the 2003 compilation album Best of James Taylor.

Both songs were recorded at A&R; Studios in New York. Landau rated \\"Hymn\\" as the best song on the album, calling attention to the line \\"As a man and a woman stand alone in the light/Give us reason to be, like the sun on the sea.\\" Perone finds the song to be \\"interesting,\\" particularly with its relationship to Taylor's life and certain Beatles influences. Perone describes three distinct sections as having three different themes, all related to people trying to influence him: first religious zealots, second stoned-out drug users, and finally the love of a woman which really frees his soul. Perone points out that the love of a woman likely references Simon, who he had recently married. Perone finds Beatles influence in that it has thematic similarities to John Lennon's recent solo song \\"God.\\" According to Perone, both \\"God\\" and \\"Hymn\\" \\"[reference] the style of gospel music.\\" Langis regards the song as being semi-religious with lines such as \\"Let the winter wind blow/Where will we hide when it comes from inside?\\" The single failed to chart.

In 1904, Petrel was sent to the East Coast of Canada for fisheries protection duties there. In 1912, Petrel was fitted for minesweeping and in 1914, was taken over by the Royal Canadian Navy for use as an examination vessel during the First World War. Following the war, Petrel was discarded. Description Petrel was the third vessel in her class, her sister ships being and . Petrel was slightly larger than her sister ships, being long with a beam and a draught of . The vessel had a tonnage of . The vessel was powered by a compound steam engine driving one screw creating (nominal). This gave the vessel a maximum speed of . The ship was armed with one QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun and three machine guns. Service history In 1888, a treaty to combat illegal fishing in Canadian waters between Canada and the United States was rejected by the United States Senate. Prime Minister Sir Charles Tupper then sought British Royal Navy aid in patrolling Canadian fisheries, but his request was rejected. The Canadian government then ordered the construction of three new armed patrol vessels. Petrel was constructed by Polson Iron Works Limited at their shipyard in Owen Sound, Ontario. The vessel entered service in 1892 patrolling the Great Lakes. Petrel was given directives to target illegal fishing by Americans in Canadian waters. On 8 May 1894, the Canadian vessel intercepted a large group of American fishing vessels, arresting 50 fisherman and impounding their boats. In 1902, Petrel seized 998 nets from poachers. However, the ship was being outpaced by the American fishing vessels that it sought to catch. That year, a newer, faster vessel was requested. On 12 August 1903, Petrel fired upon an American fishing vessel, Silver Spray, that appeared to be fishing in Canadian waters, off Long Point, in Lake Erie. Silver Spray returned to Erie, Pennsylvania having been hit twenty times, but had escaped from the Canadian vessel. Petrel remained on the Great Lakes until 1904, when the ship proved to be too slow to catch up with American fishing vessels. Replaced by , Petrel was then sent to the East Coast of Canada where fishing schooners were still being used. The ship remained in this service until 1912, when Petrel was fitted for minesweeping. At the onset of the First World War, Petrel was among the vessels forced into patrol duty by the Royal Canadian Navy and was used to patrol the Grand Manan Channel. Following the arrival of the submarines and on the East Coast in 1916, Petrel was used to train hydrophone operators on Bras D'Or Lake. After the war's end in 1918, Petrel was discarded.

They were released on a ransom of 35 million Dutch guilders (about 15.7 million GBPs) on 30 November of that year. The kidnappers Cor van Hout, Willem Holleeder, Jan Boellaard, Frans Meijer, and Martin Erkamps, were eventually caught and served prison terms. Before being extradited, Van Hout and Holleeder stayed for more than three years in France, first on the run, then in prison, and then, awaiting a change of the extradition treaty, under house arrest, and finally in prison again. Meijer escaped and lived in Paraguay for years, until he was discovered by Peter R. de Vries and imprisoned there. In 2003, Meijer stopped resisting his extradition to the Netherlands, and was transferred to a Dutch prison to serve the last part of his term. The kidnapping and subsequent trials and extraditions drew national attention and received broad media coverage. Several books were published on the kidnapping and two movies were made. Several of the kidnappers later became well-known figures in Dutch organized crime. Shortly after his release Van Hout was jailed once again, this time for four years, for his role in a drug smuggling ring. In 2003, a year after being freed a second time, he was killed in an underworld shooting in Amsterdam and had a \\"mafia-style\\" funeral, with a white hearse pulled by eight Friesian horses leading a procession of 15 white limousines.  Kidnapping  Cor van Hout and Willem Holleeder in 1987 Cor van Hout, Willem Holleeder, Frans Meijer and had been preparing the kidnapping for two years. Martin Erkamps was later involved. Several attempts to kidnap Freddy Heineken and his driver Ab Doderer at Heineken's home in Noordwijk failed when Heineken and Doderer did not show. Subsequently they were kidnapped on 9 November 1983 at 18:56 in front of Heineken's office at the in Amsterdam. They were imprisoned for three weeks in a Quonset hut, belonging to Boellaards wood manufacturing company, at business park De Heining in Westpoort, in the western part of the Amsterdam harbour area. The hut was prepared in advance by the creation of a double wall on one end, with two soundproof cells with a hidden door. This made the 42-meter long hut shorter on the inside by 4 meters, which went unnoticed. Outside working hours, the kidnappers provided for their prisoners, who were tethered to the wall with chains. The payment of the ransom was the highest ever paid for a kidnap victim at the time 11 million dollars https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2019/09/27/kidnapping-freddy-heineken- the-story-of-europes-largest-ransom/#630be3fc31d0The kidnappers fled before releasing the hostages, but, after a \\"lucky lead\\", the police discovered the hostages alive.\\"The Sunday Times Magazine\\" 8 April 2017  Books  Peter R. de Vries wrote De ontvoering van Alfred Heineken (1987) from the point of view of Cor van Hout, based on interviews with Van Hout and Holleeder in 1986, during their hotel arrest in France. Van Hout and Holleeder asked that the book not be published till after their trial. In following issues, De Vries added several extra chapters about later events. During the kidnapping and the aftermath, the Dutch magazine Panorama followed the events with several reports and pictures. In 2010, these reports were bundled and published in the book De Heineken Ontvoering, by journalist Nick Kivits and kidnapping expert Sjerp Jaarsma.  Movies  On 27 October 2011, the film De Heineken Ontvoering by Maarten Treurniet had its premiere. It was written by Maarten Treurniet and Kees van Beijnum. It stars Rutger Hauer as Freddy Heineken, Reinout Scholten van Aschat as Rem Hubrechts, Gijs Naber as Cor van Hout, Teun Kuilboer as Frans Meijer, and Korneel Evers as Jan Boellaard. Kidnapper Willem Holleeder filed a preliminary injunction requesting that the film be forbidden. Jan Boellaard, Frans Meijer and Martin Erkamps also demanded that IDTV should not show the film, as it would not be accurate enough. The injunction and requests were unsuccessful.

First used in online conversations about misogyny following the 2014 Isla Vista killings, the hashtag was popular in May 2014, and was created partly in response to the Twitter hashtag #NotAllMen. #YesAllWomen reflected a grassroots campaign in which women shared their personal stories about harassment and discrimination. The campaign attempted to raise awareness of sexism that women experience, often from people they know.  Origin  Following a killing spree in Isla Vista, California that left six people dead and fourteen others wounded, the killer's Internet activity was described as misogynistic, and hatred of women was cited as a factor in his crimes. In the wake of the killings, some Twitter users made the argument that \\"not all men\\" are like this, or would commit such crimes. Others responded by satirizing those arguments and deeming them defensive and an attempt to deflect from uncomfortable topics such as violence and sexism. In reaction to the hashtag \\"#NotAllMen,\\" an anonymous female Twitter user then created \\"#YesAllWomen\\" to express that all women are affected by sexism and misogyny, even though not all men are sexist. Some sources have reported that the hashtag creator appears to be twitter user @gildedspine, which was confirmed when The Toast published a reflection piece by her on the hashtag's anniversary in 2015. The hashtag quickly became used by women throughout social media to share their experiences of sexism and harassment. Some tweets included \\"'I have a boyfriend' is the easiest way to get a man to leave you alone. Because he respects another man more than you. #yesallwomen\\", \\"I shouldn't have to hold my car keys in hand like a weapon & check over my shoulder every few seconds when I walk at night #YesAllWomen\\", and \\"Because every single woman I know has a story about a man feeling entitled to access to her body. Every. Single. One. #YesAllWomen.\\"  Reach and impact  Within four days of the first use of #YesAllWomen, the hashtag had been tweeted 1.2 million times, surpassing predecessors that also drew attention to violence and sexism toward women. Four days after its first use, The Guardian commentator Jessica Valenti wrote that the YesAllWomen hashtag helped illustrate the prevalence of everyday sexism against women. Rebecca Solnit described it as a watershed moment \\"in which you could see change happen\\" and credited it for popularizing the concept of \\"sexual entitlement\\", which she characterized as male fury at women for not having met their emotional or sexual needs. In an interview with Democracy Now!, Solnit stated that the hashtag helped change the way that society talks about rape. Cynthia Calkins Mercado, an associate professor of psychology, told The Kansas City Star that the hashtag changed her mind about the prevalence of misogyny in American society, and has raised awareness of women's experiences. Writing in The New Yorker, Sasha Weiss called the campaign \\"a kind of memorial, a stern demand for a more just society\\", and praised Twitter as a powerful vehicle for activism. = Cartoon controversy = On June 1, 2014, cartoonists Michael Kupperman and David Rees were scheduled to release a political cartoon entitled \\"Testosterone Entitlement Theatre Presents: The Man-Babies in 'Hashtag Harassment!'\\" for The New York Times's Sunday installment's \\"See Something, Say Something\\" that satirized the Men's rights movement's response to the hashtag. However, the newspaper believed that \\"the subject matter (male rage, online bullying & the hashtag #yesallwomen) was 'too sensitive'\\" to publish and refused to print it. In response to the editorial decision, both Kupperman and Rees uploaded the comic strip independently. That weekend, The New York Times published a different comic by Brian McFadden that tackled similar issues. = Criticism = Samantha Levine, a columnist at The Daily Beast, wrote that conflating dress code restrictions and men whistling at women with the Isla Vista killings risks women who have been victims of violence not being taken seriously when they use the hashtag. Emily Shire criticized some #YesAllWomen tweets as trivial in the context of the Isla Vista killings, citing examples such as \\"I've never seen a hot husband with a fat wife on a sitcom.\\"  See also  * Hashtag activism * Me too (hashtag) * Who Needs Feminism * Women's rights in 2014  References  External links * Postings to #YesAllWomen on Twitter *Cartoon: - Political cartoon by Michael Kupperman and David Rees inspired by #YesAllWomwn *Cartoon: - Political cartoon by Brian McFadden satirizing \\"not all men\\" - Featured in on June 1, 2014 Category:Violence against women Category:Feminism in the United States Category:Feminist protests Category:Hashtags Category:Fourth-wave feminism ","title":"YesAllWomen"},{"id":"42882641","text":"Marys River may refer to: * Marys River (Illinois) * Marys River (Nevada) * Marys River (Oregon) See also * St. Mary's River (disambiguation) * Mary River (disambiguation) ","title":"Marys River"},{"id":"42882668","text":"Lee Inglis (born August 31, 1947) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player.

One estimate (in 2007) of the number of English speakers in China is over 200 million and rising, with 50 million secondary school children now studying the language. However, online test score data from the 2018 EF English Proficiency Index ranks the nation at 47th out of the 88 countries measured, with an overall score of 'Low proficiency.' It suggested that internet users in cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Jiangsu had a generally decent command of the language while those in other cities were limited to basic vocabulary. A 2017 article from The Telegraph also suggests that less than 1 percent of people in China (some 10 million) speak English conversationally. According to a report on China Daily, many students start learning English in kindergarten before they start school. Most schoolchildren are taught their first English lesson in third grade in primary school. Despite that it is common to learn English at an early age, some have criticized the pedagogy for being geared towards only the skills being tested. Therefore, skills such as learning grammar rules become more focused on memorization. However, creative skills such as writing are still an important part of English education in China. The methods, which focus on testing students' memorization of grammar rules and vocabulary, have been criticized by Western educationalists and linguists as fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, students are seldom able to put newly learned English words into use. This problem arises because Mandarin is the official and dominant language in China, while English often has little use in the country. This problem is further reinforced through the national Band 4 examination, where 80% of the test is the writing component and 20% of the test is listening, while an additional speaking component is only required for English major students. However, Guangdong Province has started requiring all students to take the English speaking exam for the National College Entrance Examination as of 2010. History China's first contact with the English language occurred between Chinese and English traders, and the first missionary schools to teach English were established in Macau in the 1630s.Between 1911-1949, English was popular, it was taught in missionary schools and thirteen Christian colleges. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Russian was originally the primary foreign language.Fu, Shiyi, p. 28-29 English began to transition into the education system during the 1960s as a result of the Sino-Soviet split. Because of the condemnation of the English language during the Cultural Revolution, English education did not return until Richard Nixon visited China in 1972. The only textbooks for English instructions were translations of Mao Zedong's works until the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, and the Gaokao was restored in 1978.Fu, Shiyi, p. 29. Like mentioned in the above section, once China established the open door policy under Deng Xiaoping, the popularity of English and other languages began to thrive. English became very popular between the late 1970s to 1990s in areas that dealt with trading and tourism Testing The College English Test (CET) is the primary English language test in China. As of 2011, employers have made scores in the CET 4 and CET 6 requirements for employment, and The Lowdown on China's Higher Education stated that in China \\"CET 4 and CET 6 National English examinations have become the symbol of English proficiency in reading and writing.\\"Editorial Note. There is also the Public English Test System (PETS). Hospitality industry Grand Canal tour boat, Suzhou Tourism in China is a major industry, producing 11.04% of the GDP and contributing direct and indirect employment of up to 28.25 million people. Nonetheless, not many employees in the hospitality sector speak English. One source indicates that it's more common in premium- grade hotels \\"while less expensive hotels might have few or no staff members who speak English\\". Bilingual guide services are readily available, however. Online English Education Recently, online education has been gaining momentum in China, including online one on one English education. Many Chinese companies, such as Magic Ears, are recruiting teachers from the U.S. and other English-speaking countries. Leading players such as New Oriental Education & Technology Group and TAL Education Group have gone public in the US and seen their shares soar. Now, online start-ups are gaining ground with parents who grew up in the internet era and see advantages in digital learning. Beijing- based VIPKid has expanded to 200,000 students and just raised venture money at a valuation of more than US$1.5 billion. The virtual teaching business is booming. Both VIPKid and DaDa were founded in 2013 and have continued to grow since then. VIPKid has more than 500,000 students in China and 63 other countries and 60,000 North American teachers, while Dada currently has more than 100,000 students and 10,000 teachers. Their competitors have grown too: companies like Magic Ears and QKids are also connecting teachers to Chinese children working on learning English.

The lake discharges its waters into Ganga river through Kathar Nala. Some times the flow of kathar Nala gets reversed during the high floods in Ganges and Sarayu rivers. Surha Tal has been historically famous for the variety of migratory and native birds. It was declared a Bird Sanctuary in 1991. Traditionally the ecosystem of Surha Tal has been well adopted to cultivation of Rice and fishing but the basic problem of the area is overpopulation which exerts tremendous pressure on the catchment of the lake as well as lake itself.

Rossi was also known for his work devising ways to evaluate federally funded initiatives in education, health services, crime control, and housing. He influentially applied his sociological expertise to affect related policy-making and funding agencies. At his death, he was the Stuart A. Rice professor emeritus of Sociology and the Director Emeritus of the Social and Demographic Research Institute (SADRI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Biography Rossi was born December 27, 1921, in Corona, Queens, New York City, New York, to Italian immigrant parents. He graduated from the City College of New York with a degree in sociology in 1943. After graduating, he intended on going into social work, however, he enlisted in the Army in 1943, and served in the 100th Infantry Division in Europe during World War II. After the war, Rossi used his G.I. Bill to continued his education at Columbia University. While at Columbia, Rossi met his wife, Alice Schaerr. Alice also became an eminent sociologist and in 1966, was one of the founders of the National Organization for Women (NOW). During his time at Columbia Rossi was influenced and mentored by two professors and notable social researchers, Robert K. Merton and Paul F. Lazarsfeld. Rossi's doctoral dissertation was entitled \\"The Application of Latent Structure Analysis to the Study of Social Stratification\\" and he earned his doctorate in sociology in 1951. After earning his doctorate, Rossi went into academia joining the faculty at Harvard University for a four-year stint as a Research Associate and Assistant Professor. In 1955 he then joined the University of Chicago‚Äôs Department of Sociology faculty, where he stayed for 12 years, first as an assistant professor then full professor. He also was director of the National Opinion Research Center in Hyde Park for seven years, helping to secure the funds to construct a new building. While at the University of Chicago, Rossi served on the doctoral committee for Chicago priest and writer Andrew Greeley. The two collaborated on a 1962 study of the Catholic school system which was published as \\"The Education of Catholic Americans\\", and was notable as the first systematic study of Catholic schools. Rossi was the editor of the American Journal of Sociology from 1958 to 1961, and also served as editor of the Social Science Research journal, where he was senior advisory editor at the time of his death. Due to disagreements, with then University of Chicago President Edward Levi, over issues including funding of the research center, Rossi left the University of Chicago. After leaving Chicago, Rossi assumed the chair of the Department of Social Relations at Johns Hopkins University where he also served as Director of Research of the Social and Demographic Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts. While at Johns Hopkins University, Rossi was involved in several important War on Poverty era program evaluations. One such evaluation was assisting the President‚Äôs Commission on Civil Disorders with understanding the causes of the urban unrest following the 1967 race riots. Out of his work with the President's Commission on Civil Disorders, grew a comprehensive study of how cities in America responded to the riots of the late 1960s in his work \\"Roots of Urban Discontent: Public Policy, Municipal Institutions and the Ghetto\\". In 1974, Rossi joined the Sociology faculty at the University of Massachusetts, where he stayed until his retirement in the early 1990s. While at the University of Massachusetts, Rossi served as the 71st President of the American Sociological Association from 1979 to 1980 During his career, Rossi authored over 40 books and 200 scholarly journal articles. He was highly regarded, widely recognized, and sought after for his work on evaluating social programs. Included in this work are his controversial studies of the homeless problem in America. The work for which he is best known is ‚ÄúDown and Out in America: The Origins of Homelessness‚Äù (University of Chicago, 1989). In this research, he chronicled the shift in the nation‚Äôs homeless population from the older white male denizens of post-World War II skid rows to a younger, larger group that included many more women, children and minorities. In conducting this research he made the first systematic attempts to count the homeless, ultimately finding dramatically smaller numbers than claimed by advocates for the homeless. He found that homelessness is largely a temporary rather than permanent problem and, therefore, that short infusions of aid could make a large difference. His work focused on federal food programs was documented in his book \\"Feeding the Poor: Assessing Federal Food Programs\\". His work on assessing the severity of crimes via surveys of the American public (Public Opinion on Sentencing Federal Criminals and Just Punishments: Sentencing Guidelines and Public Opinion Compared) has influenced the U.S. Sentencing Commission. His efforts on evaluating public welfare and anti-crime programs was highly influential and was frequently cited by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and other policy makers. Rossi died October 7, 2006 in Amherst, Massachusetts.  Five-Domain Evaluation Model  In the late 1970s, Peter Rossi with the help of his colleagues Mark W. Lipsey & Howard E Freeman developed an evaluation model called the Five-Domain Evaluation Model. In this model, each evaluation should be custom-made to fit resources, local needs, and the type of program. This includes custom-fitting the evaluation questions, methods and procedures, and the nature of the evaluator-stakeholder relationship. In the eyes of Rossi, the evaluation questions were the core while the rest of the evaluation evolves around it. The Five-Domain Evaluation Model highlights five primary evaluation domains: # Needs assessment of the program # Design of the program # Program implementation and service delivery assessment # Program impact or outcomes assessment # Program efficiency assessment References Category:American sociologists Category:Food security in the United States Category:Homelessness in the United States Category:1921 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Presidents of the American Sociological Association Category:City College of New York alumni Category:Columbia University alumni ","title":"Peter H.

The Chancery is located at 42 Elgin Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4. The Ambassador's Official Residence is located at the Deerfield Residence, Phoenix Park, Dublin 8. Edward F. Crawford is the current ambassador, having presented his credentials to President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins on July 1, 2019. History =Chancery= The embassy was designed by American architect John M. Johansen, in consultation with Irish architect Michael Scott. It was constructed between 1962 and 1964 on a triangular site at the intersection between Elgin Road and Pembroke Road. The building is circular in plan, incorporating modern interpretations of early Celtic and later Irish buildings with contemporary, bold American design as well as symbolising the first American flag, and is considered a Dublin landmark. There are five floors at the complex, two underground and three above ground, plus a smaller sixth storey on the rooftop. On 23 May 2011, a 2005 model Cadillac Presidential State Car was involved in an incident when it got stuck on a ramp as it exited the U.S. Embassy during an official visit by President Barack Obama. It is understood that the wheelbase of the vehicle was too great for the ramp, and it had to be towed off the ramp as a large crowd looked on. President Obama left the embassy through an alternative exit. The U.S. Secret Service later stated that the car was a spare, and that President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama were in another vehicle. =Ambassador's Residence= Deerfield Residence, a large 18th-century house on over in the Phoenix Park, has since 1927 been the United States Ambassador's Official Residence in Ireland. Before the 1960s, the embassy was located at the grounds, then known as the Chief Secretary's Lodge. The United States first opened a consulate in Ireland in 1859 at a building on Adelaide Road, Dublin 2, and also had a presence at Merrion Square, Dublin 2 from 1948. Both current diplomatic premises are owned and operated by the United States Department of State on behalf of the United States federal government. =Future= In late 2012, the United States Department of State announced the embassy will move to new location within a number of years. The Chancery in Ballsbridge, which was 50 years old in 2014, has been deemed \\"no longer suitable\\", and an embassy spokesperson stated that the current building no longer meets the needs in terms of size of the expanding American diplomatic presence in Ireland (between 150 and 200 staff work at the embassy), and does not conform to new construction and security requirements (\\"code\\") issued by Washington D.C.. A number of sites around Dublin City are being considered for the construction of a new embassy building, which will be on larger grounds, will be a larger building than the Ballsbridge Chancery, and may be located nearer to the Ambassador's Residence and Dublin Airport for security reasons and ease of access. However, completion of the move to a new embassy facility is likely to take up to 10 years and cost tens of millions of dollars. Security Security at the embassy is seen as a priority for Ireland's national police, the Garda S√≠och√°na, and is protected around-the-clock by a team of armed, plainclothes detectives from the Special Detective Unit (SDU), the force's counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence section. They provide close protection to the ambassador and high-ranking diplomats when travelling outside of the embassy, as well as motorcade security. The U.S. Ambassador's Residence (Deerfield Residence, Phoenix Park) is also guarded. Within the embassy and residence grounds, security is the responsibility of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (United States Department of State) and Marine Corps Embassy Security Group, who are heavily armed. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, new secure entrances, guardhouses and blast walls were installed. The external windows of the Chancery building are reflective, as a privacy measure. In late 2013, significant upgrades were made to the physical and perimeter security of the embassy, designed to reduce the threat of vehicle bombings and to repel intruders. This was part of U.S. government security directives at diplomatic missions across 14 different European nations in response to the 2012 Benghazi attacks.

The pilot and master were both found negligent in causing the collision. The collision led to the opening of the current West Seattle Bridge in 1984. Background The bridge was constructed in 1924. Increasing traffic over the years had made the bridge one of Seattle's worst chokepoints. Seattle planners had worked on a higher bridge to supplement it, and had multiple funding sources lined up, but these funding sources backed out due to a corruption scandal. By 1975, the project was widely considered dead. Federal highway administrator Norbert Tiemann remarked, \\"Short of a tug knocking it down (which could trigger special bridge replacement funds), there is nothing else. And you certainly wouldn't want to go that route.\\" Such a disaster would qualify the project for federal bridge replacement funds. Collision The Antonio Chavez, the ship that hit the old bridge. On June 11, 1978, the Chavez struck the bridge. No one was hurt in the collision, but it resulted in the bridge being stuck open. The bridge was irreparably damaged. Aftermath A US Coast Guard inquiry found the ship's pilot, Rolf Neslund, and master, Gojko Gospodnetic, were negligent. Gospodnetic was fired and Neslund forced into retirement. In 1980, after several years of a deteriorating domestic relationship characterized by alcoholism and violent conflict, Neslund disappeared. Police alleged that in an argument over the pension money, Rolf's wife, Ruth Neslund, shot and killed her husband on August 8, 1980, burning his remains at their home on Lopez Island. The body was never found. However, with no sign of Rolf, Ruth was charged in 1983 for the murder and stood trial in 1985. Ruth died in prison of natural causes in February 1993. The proposed high span West Seattle Bridge, which had previously lost funding, had a new source of funding in federal bridge replacement funds.

History The information about the communication station provided in a U.S intelligence document at the war time. It stated that \\"Hozan Station at Takao is one of the largest and most powerful in Japanese possession.\\" The radio station was the first radio station in Taiwan built by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1919. Despite the military nature of the station, the channels were dedicated to civilian communication. After a major mechanical failure threatened the maritime safety, the Japanese built another radio station at Sankaiseki (Sankuaico) and consolidated it with the Hozan (Fongshan) station into the Takao Communication Unit in 1937. Once the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out soon after that, the Takao Communication Unit was used to maintain the south west Pacific communication of the Empire of Japan. It was also used as tactical radio to jam and monitor the US and British movements on the sea and in the air. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the station was taken over by the Republic of China Navy and converted it into a navy boarding house. Over the next decade, the navy boarding house was used by the navy as an interrogation facility for serviceman accused for political actions. In 1976, this place became the Mingde Disciplinary Camp of the navy where persistent disobedient servicemen were imprisoned.

Edward Grey's son Sir John Grey of Groby married Elizabeth Woodville, who, after John's death married King Edward IV. Their son Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset made preparations for building the first Bradgate House in the late 15th century but died before work began. It was his son, Thomas Grey, 2nd marquis of Dorset who built the first Bradgate House, completing it circa 1520. This is one of the first unfortified great houses in England and one of the earliest post-Roman use of bricks. It was lived in by the Grey family for the next 220 years. It is believed that the house was the birthplace of Lady Jane Grey, later Queen, ruling for a mere 9 days before being overthrown by Mary I. Jane was executed in 1553 and when her father was executed the following year the estate passed to the crown. Local history claims that groundskeepers marked the occasion of Jane's execution by pollarding the estate's oak trees in a symbolic beheading. Examples of pollarded oaks can still be seen in the park.Bradgate Park: the History of Bradgate Park and Swithland Wood In 1563 the family regained favour, and the Groby manor, including Bradgate, was restored to Jane's Uncle, Lord John Grey of Pirgo. His great-grandson was made Earl of Stamford. Later earls acquired estates in Enville, Staffordshire, and Dunham Massey, Cheshire. Bradgate House's ruined chapel and tower Sometime after 1739 they moved out of Bradgate, which began a long decline. The spectacular ruins of the house are still visible at the centre of the park.John Leland's itinerary: travels in Tudor England, ed. J.

As well as considerable remains of walls and fireplaces, it has four truncated towers and the chapel is still intact,Forsyth, Mary (1974) The History of Bradgate, The Bradgate Park Trust containing a tomb effigy to Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford and his wife. In the mid-19th century, George Harry Grey and the 7th Earl of Stamford and Warrington commissioned a new house to be built designed by the architect Mr M.J. Dain of Dain and Parsons, London, and built by the local builder Mr Thomas Rudkin. Bradgate House was completed in 1856 in the village of Groby, Leicestershire and built in the Jacobean style it has been referred to as the Calendar House because it had 365 windows, 52 rooms, and 12 main chimneys. The house was sadly demolished in the mid-1920s when Leicestershire estates were sold by late Earls niece Katherine Henrietta Venezia Grey, who incidentally changed her surname to Grey on the condition of her inheritance of the estates from her deceased uncle. Bradgate House in the village of Groby is frequently confused with the 16th-century ruined house of the same name in Bradgate Park 2 miles in distance.

Masoumi-Tehrani was born in Tehran to a distinguished cleric family and attained the rank of Marja al-Taqlid or a \\"source of emulation\\" in 1988. Masoumi-Tehrani is an accomplished calligrapher and spends much of his time engaged in this profession as he believes that money should not be made through religion. He strongly advocates human rights for all regardless of religious ideology or belief and has created in calligraphy form the Torah, Psalms and Quran to foster unity amongst religions. Masoumi-Tehrani has been pressured by authorities, detained, and imprisoned on various occasions, starting when he was 23. He claims to have been questioned even by agents of reformist president Mohammad Khatami regarding his project to publish calligraphy of the Torah, and that beginning in 2004 he received threats connected to his similar project for the Psalms. In April 2014, as a mark of solidarity with the Bah√°'√≠ community of Iran, the largest religious minority in the country, he gifted the Bah√°'√≠s of the world a calligraphy work from the writings of Bah√°'u'll√°h, the prophet founder of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith, which states: \\"Consort with all religions with amity and concord, that they may inhale from you the sweet fragrance of God. Beware lest amidst men the flame of foolish ignorance overpower you. All things proceed from God and unto Him they return. He is the source of all things and in Him all things are ended.\\" The Ayatollah's call for religious tolerance and co-existence has received worldwide support from religious leaders. In November 2015, Masoumi-Tehrani gave 15 recently arrested Bah√°'√≠s in Iran another calligraphy work he produced. It featured a quotation from The Hidden Words, one of the Baha'i Faith's sacred texts: \\"O Son Of Man! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy bed, or to shed thy life-blood on the dust, a martyr in My path, and so become the manifestation of My command and the revealer of My light in the highest paradise? Judge thou aright, O servant!\\" He said he wished to raise awareness among Iranians about the dignity of people regardless of religion.

Laidback and blundering at his job, Jung-min is actually secretly studying for a civil servant exam to get away from his boss who's always picking on him. Every day, residents protest outside the police station, shouting that the police should make up for the falling apartment prices and catch the murderer. To make matters worse, Jung-min's mother who happens to be the president of the women's association is leading the protest. He vows to catch the killer this time in order to save his dignity as a detective and a son. However, his elaborate plans are upset by the appearance of Young-seok, the neighborhood unemployed bum. Because of the reward for the killer's capture, Young-seok is trying to catch him well, and his natural detective skills lead him to always arrive at the crime scene one step ahead of the police. Furthermore, he criticizes every little thing that Jung-min does and is a royal pain in the neck.

The commission was created with the primary intention of regulating the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA): the government- owned corporation and government monopoly that distributes and transmits all energy in Puerto Rico as well as producing 70% of all energy in Puerto Rico. Before the commission came into existence, PREPA regulated both itself and the energy industry without any oversight whatsoever. As renewable energy became economically feasible, Puerto Rico lagged behind in comparison to other jurisdictions. This did not bode well with several energy businesses and think tanks, such as the Association of Producers of Renewable Energy (APER) and the Center for the New Economy (CNE), which advocated for the creation of a separate independent entity capable of regulating the industry. Organizationally, the commission is overseen by a board of directors comprised by three commissioners appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. The commission is also supported by an executive director who works together with the Puerto Rico Energy Affairs Administration and provides technical advice to the commissioners. After the September 2017 hurricanes largely destroyed the island's aging, neglected and fragile power grid, and among the rush to simply rebuild as fast as possible, advocates of renewable energy and micro grids tried to turn the conversation - and infrastructure investment - to solar PV, microgrids and combined heat and power (CHP).

ASHRAE has more than 57,000 members in more than 132 countries worldwide. Its members are composed of building services engineers, architects, mechanical contractors, building owners, equipment manufacturers' employees, and others concerned with the design and construction of HVAC&R; systems in buildings. The society funds research projects, offers continuing education programs, and develops and publishes technical standards to improve building services engineering, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and sustainable development. History ASHRAE was founded in 1894 at a meeting of engineers in New York City, formerly headquartered at 345 East 47th Street, and has held an annual meeting since 1895. Until 1954 it was known as the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers (ASHVE); in that year it changed its name to the American Society of Heating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHAE). Its current name and organization came from the 1959 merger of ASHAE and the American Society of Refrigerating Engineers (ASRE). Despite having 'American' in its name, ASHRAE is a global organization, holding international events. In 2012, it rebranded itself with a new logo and tagline: \\"Shaping Tomorrow's Built Environment Today\\". =2020 Coronavirus advice= Lawrence J. Schoen argued in the ASHRAE Journal Newsletter of 24 March 2020 that, because of the WHO guidance: it was the duty of ASHRAE members to * Increase disinfection of frequently touched surfaces. * Install more hand sanitation dispensers, assuming they can be procured. * Supervise or shut down food preparation and warming areas, including the office pantry and coffee station. * Close or post warning signs at water fountains in favor of bottle filling stations and sinks, or even better, encourage employees to bring their water from home. In light of the OSHA Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19 that \\"non-health care workplaces fall into the medium and lower exposure risk categories\\", and absent a clear WHO directive, only after running through the checklist mentioned above should they tackle the HVAC vector. He acknowledged that in at least one non peer-reviewed paper detectable levels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA were found to be transmitted by aerodynamic suspension in toilets and ICUs but decided to make this revelation of secondary importance in his own Guidance. Further discussion of this topic can be found in a National Post article by Tom Blackwell dated 26 April 2020. Blackwell mentions the CIHR-funded study of Brian Fleck, who observes that Legionnaires' disease is known to be spread by buildings. Blackwell repeats the warning of Morawska and Cao, who strongly believe: The research article entitled COVID-19 Outbreak Associated with Air Conditioning in Restaurant, Guangzhou, China, 2020 was also mentioned by Blackwell in support of his hypothesis; and on 27 April 2020, the journal Nature published an article entitled Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals in which air flow in poorly ventilated areas such as indoor toilets were possibly to blame for the persistence of the harm to society. Publications The ASHRAE Handbook is a four-volume resource for HVAC&R; technology and is available in both print and electronic versions. The volumes are Fundamentals, HVAC Applications, HVAC Systems and Equipment, and Refrigeration. One of the four volumes is updated each year. ASHRAE also publishes a set of standards and guidelines relating to HVAC systems and issues, that are often referenced in building codes and used by consulting engineers, mechanical contractors, architects, and government agencies. These standards are periodically reviewed, revised and republished. Examples of some ASHRAE Standards are: *Standard 34 ‚Äì Designation and Safety Classification of Refrigerants *Standard 55 ‚Äì Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy *Standard 62.1 ‚Äì Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality (versions: 2001 and earlier as \\"62\\", 2004 and beyond as \\"62.1\\") *Standard 62.2 ‚Äì Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Low-Rise Residential Buildings *Standard 90.1 ‚Äì Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings ‚Äì The IESNA is a joint sponsor of this standard. *Standard 135 ‚Äì BACnet - A Data Communication Protocol for Building Automation and Control Networks *Standard 189.1 ‚Äì Standard for the Design of High Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings The society also publishes two magazines: the ASHRAE Journal is issued monthly, and High Performing Buildings Magazine is published quarterly. They contain articles on related technology, information on upcoming meetings, editorials, and case studies of various well-performing buildings. ASHRAE also publishes books, ASHRAE Transactions, and the International Journal of HVAC&R; Research. Legislation ASHRAE supported the Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014 (H.R. 4092; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the United States Department of Energy to establish a centralized clearinghouse to disseminate information on federal programs, incentives, and mechanisms for financing energy-efficient retrofits and upgrades at schools. Society awards ASHRAE offers six categories of awards: achievement awards to recognize personal honors; personal awards for general and specific society activities; paper awards; society awards for groups or chapters; chapters and regional awards. =ASHRAE Fellows= ASHRAE Fellow is a Membership Grade of Distinction conferred by The College of Fellows of ASHRAE, Inc. to an ASHRAE member with significant publications or innovations and distinguished scientific and engineering background in the fields of heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, ventilation. The ASHRAE Fellow membership grade is the highest elected grade in ASHRAE. Headquarters renewal To demonstrate the Society's commitment to sustainability, ASHRAE renovated its previous headquarters building in Atlanta, Ga. After the renovation and occupancy in June 2008, the building received many awards, including an Energy Star rating with a score of 95, a Platinum Certification from USGBC's LEED program, and four Green Globes from the Green Building Initiative. The current site energy use intensity (EUI) is 35.8 kBtu/Sqft (411 MJ/m2), a 60 percent reduction from the pre-renovation value. The renovation included the use of a dedicated outdoor air supply (DOAS) system with energy recovery and humidity control; a ground-source heat pump system (GSHP); and variable refrigerant flow systems with heat recovery. The building also serves as a live case study. A web-based user interface allowed researchers around the world to extract data from the building to study factors such as energy use and electric power demand, water consumption and indoor air quality. In moving its world headquarters from Atlanta to the Atlanta suburb of Peachtree Corners the society plans to spend $15.7 million to retrofit an existing building so that its energy consumption is reduced to net-zero and so that it will become a showcase for the latest HVAC&R; equipment and technology.

The illustrated cartoons, appearing as baby cupid characters, began to gain popularity after the publication of O'Neill's comic strips in 1909, and O'Neill began to illustrate and sell paper doll versions of the Kewpies. The characters were first produced as bisque dolls in Waltershausen, Germany, beginning in 1912, and became extremely popular in the early 20th century. The Kewpie dolls were initially made out of bisque exclusively, but composition versions were introduced in the 1920s, and celluloid versions were manufactured in the following decades. In 1949, Effanbee created the first hard plastic versions of the dolls, and soft rubber and vinyl versions were produced by Cameo Co. and Jesco between the 1960s and 1990s. The earlier bisque and composition versions of Kewpie dolls are widely sought-after by antique and doll collectors, who especially want those hand- signed by O'Neill. Kewpies should not be confused with the baby-like Billiken figures that debuted in 1908. Background and history Rose O'Neill (circa 1907) Rose O'Neill, a Midwest native who had worked as a writer and illustrator in New York City, initially conceptualized the Kewpie as a cartoon intended for a comic strip in 1909. According to O'Neill, the idea for the Kewpies came to her in a dream. The comic, featuring the cherub-faced characters, was first printed in Ladies' Home Journal in the December 1909 issue. O'Neill described the characters as \\"a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time.\\" Their name, often shortened to Kewpies, derives from Cupid, the Roman god of erotic love.V & A Museum of Childhood After the characters gained popularity among both adults and children, O'Neill began illustrating paper dolls of them, called Kewpie Kutouts. O'Neill produced a Sunday comic strip for newspapers starting December 2, 1917, syndicated by the McClure Syndicate. The strip ended nine months later, on July 28, 1918. She produced a second Sunday strip starting November 25, 1934, and that version lasted until February 6, 1937. Production =German bisque: 1912‚Äì1915= Ralph Foster Museum Kewpies in a Jell-O newspaper ad from 1915 As demand for the Kewpie characters increased, Geo. Borgfeldt & Co. in New York contacted O'Neill in 1912 about developing a line of dolls and figurines. O'Neill agreed, and J.D. Kestner, a German toy company located in Waltershausen, set forth to manufacture small bisque dolls of the Kewpies. After the company manufactured the first run of dolls, they sent samples to O'Neill, who disapproved of the design because she felt they \\"did not look like her characters.\\" O'Neill traveled to Germany and had the company destroy the moulds of the dolls, and oversaw the final redesign of them, working with a 17-year-old art student named Joseph Kallus. The dolls were then released in nine different sizes, ranging from in height. These early Kewpies wore a heart-shaped decal on their chests, which read \\"Kewpie, Germany\\", and some had jointed arms. Many of these original German Kewpies were signed by O'Neill herself, and some were featured in various poses. The small dolls became an international hit, and by 1914, O'Neill had become the highest-paid female illustrator in the country, garnering a small fortune from the wild popularity of the dolls. The Kewpie brand soon became a household name, and was used widely in product advertising, including promotion for Jell-O, Colgate, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, and Sears. The Kewpies also appeared as a brand on a multitude of household items and other memorabilia, such as dishware, rattles, soap, pepper shakers, coloring books, poetry collections, and stationery. O'Neill also famously used the characters to promote the women's suffrage movement, using the illustrations in slogans and cartoons. =Composition and celluloid: 1916‚Äì1930s= After World War I began in Europe, production of the bisque Kewpie dolls moved from Germany to France and Belgium, due to rising tensions after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Around this time, the dolls also began to be produced in the United States, made of composition material rather than bisque, due to bisque's fragility. The manufacturers also began to increase the sizes of the dolls, producing versions in addition to the versions. The American composition dolls also had the distinctive heart-shaped decal on the chest, reading \\"Kewpies, des. & copyright by Rose O'Neill.\\" Like the original bisque models, some of the composition Kewpies were also hand-signed by O'Neill, and they all included jointed arms. In the mid-1920s, small-sized celluloid versions of Kewpies appeared, and were often given out as prizes at carnivals. Many of the celluloid versions were mainly manufactured in Japan, unlicensed, and were of a lower quality than other Kewpies. During this time, many Kewpies were sold with clothing, as well. =Later models: 1944‚Äìpresent= As photographs became more commonplace in advertising, the prominence of Kewpies in the marketing circuit began to wane. O'Neill returned to Missouri, where she died purportedly impoverished of complications from a series of strokes in 1944. Despite the lessening in popularity, Kewpies continued to be manufactured for the majority of the century, including hard plastic versions, as well as all- bisque replicas of the original Kewpies, produced by Jesco and Cameo Co. in the 1960s until the 1990s. These reproduction Kewpies lack the heart-shaped decal that distinguishes the original, older versions. Collectibility According to 200 Years of Dolls (fourth edition), a 10-inch Kewpie with a bisque head, composition body, and glass eyes today is worth $6,500, while a doll is valued at $20,000. Many of the original, small-sized German-produced bisque Kewpies (circa 1912-1915) range from $200‚Äì$500 among collectors. Composition Kewpies range from $100‚Äì$300, while celluloid versions (especially unlicensed Japanese reproductions) are worth considerably less. Kewpies that were hand-signed by Rose O'Neill (most often etched on their arms or feet) are much rarer than unsigned Kewpies. In popular culture Kewpie Fusion toys in Japan Kewpie mayonnaise from Japan *To \\"win a kewpie doll\\" is a common English idiom in the US, meaning that one has won a modest prize. This idiom is used in numerous fictional works, including Get Smart, The Monkees, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Law and Order: SVU, and The Outsider. *In season 3 episode 5 of Seinfeld, \\"The Library\\", the Library Cop Bookman refers to the librarian Kramer is involved with as \\"Kewpie doll\\". *The Kewpie doll is the mascot of Kewpee Hamburgers, a chain of fast-food restaurants founded in 1923 in Flint, Michigan, by Samuel V.

The vessel was known as Fireboat 20, until she was officially commissioned, on June 8, 2016. A sister ship will follow within a year. The two new vessels will replace the Challenger and the Liberty, commissioned in 1987. The earlier vessels had a troubled maintenance record. She will be one of the most powerful fireboats in the world. Protector is propelled by a pair of Voith-Schneider propellers, an advanced propulsion system that bears some resemblance to helicopter propulsion, and enable instantaneous changes in the propeller thrust. She is 108 feet long, with a maximum speed of 13 knots. Her ten water cannon can pump 41,000 gallons per minute, more than four times as much as her predecessors. She is able to throw her water up to in the air, and up to away. The two vessels were designed by Robert Allan Limited, a firm known for designing many widely admired tugboats, fireboats and support vessels. In addition to firefighting duties Fireboat 20 and her sister have air-tight crew compartments and a decontamination chamber, so they are equipped to respond to the releases of hazardous material, in particular they can respond to radiological, poison gas, or germ warfare attacks. The vessels pumps can de-water flooded structures. The vessels are highly automated, and require only a crew of four. They can transport 12 additional individuals. Part of the cabin can serve as an emergency infirmary. The pair of vessels was budgeted at $51 million. Operational history On May 20, 2016, the Protector joined other emergency vessels and vehicles in fighting a fire at Long Beach's Seal Beach Pier.

Russian forces under Fyodor Sukhatin and Aleksander Lesley managed to capture the fortress of Dorogobuzh, which was held by some 300 Polish-Lithuanian soldiers, supported by an unknown number of Zaporozhian Cossacks, loyal to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. On 20 June 1632 the Zemsky Sobor declared war on Poland-Lithuania. The Russians hoped to recapture Smolensk and other territories which they had lost after the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1605‚Äì18). The Russians acted very slowly and their army did not leave Moscow until 9 August, crossing the border on 30 September. Altogether, Russian Army had some 60 000 men, including main force of 25 000 and 158 cannons, led by Mikhail Shein. Due to muddy ground, they marched was slow, reaching Vyazma on 6 October. There, Shein ordered front guard under Sukhatin and Lesley to march towards Dorogobuzh and capture the town, opening the way towards Smolensk. In spring of 1632, upon initiative of Voivode of Smolensk Aleksander Korwin Gosiewski, fortifications of Dorogobuzh were reinforced. Its garrison consisted of a 100-strong unit of heavy cavalry, Polish infantry (200 men) and Cossacks. All forces were commanded by Jerzy Luskina. By 14 October the Russians burned most of the town, murdering many of its residents. The defenders retreated to a castle, located on a nearby hill, which fell on 28 October. Two days later main Russian force under Shein arrived at Dorogobuzh. The captured fortress served as main supply base for the Russians.

The Folly was once a prominent feature of the area, but has become obscured by the surrounding woodland Brown's Folly is a folly tower on the Farleigh Rise near the village of Bathford in Somerset, England. The Folly was designated a Grade II listed building in 1988. It gave its name to Brown's Folly, a 100 acre Site of Special Scientific Interest, notified in 1974. The tower was built in 1845 by Colonel Wade Browne, the squire of Monkton Farleigh Manor, to provide employment during an agricultural recession. It replaced a semaphore tower which had previously stood on the site. The tower has a square plan and tapers as it rises. The upper stage has round arched openings and balustraded handrails, although the balustrading is missing on the north and west sides. In 1907 the tower was renovated by the owner of the estate, Charles Hobhouse, who had his shooting parties meet at the tower. Demolition was suggested in 1938 but did not take place. The Folly is structurally sound, but is not currently open to the public. Since 1998 it has been maintained by the Folly Fellowship who replaced the roof. A depiction of the Folly appears on the unofficial coat of arms of Bathford Parish Council.

The conflict formally lasted eighteen years, but during this time hostilities were ceased on several occasions due to temporary treaties being signed between the warring parties. The climax of the conflict was the disastrous King Jan Olbracht‚Äôs raid on Moldavia (1497, see also Battle of the Cosmin Forest). In the war the Kingdom of Poland was supported by its fiefs, the Duchy of Mazovia and the State of the Teutonic Order, as well as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Ottoman Empire on the other hand, was backed by the Crimean Khanate, Moldavia, and Wallachia. For most of the 15th century, the Principality of Moldavia was a vassal of Poland, but at the same time other states, notably the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire together with the Crimean Khanate, tried to subdue Moldavia. After the Fall of Constantinople (1453), the Turks directed their expansion northwards, towards the lower Danube and behind the mighty river, which also threatened Poland.  Outbreak of the war  In 1485, Ottomans captured Black Sea ports Akkerman and Kilia. This undermined Polish eastern trade. The king promised help, calling pospolite ruszenie and Crown army, together with mercenaries. In November 1485, Poles commanded by Jan Karnkowski entered Moldavia, defeating some Tatar forces. Jan Olbracht himself prepared an anti-Ottoman raid in 1487, but had to change these plans and sent his forces to fight Tatars, allied with the Ottomans. On September 8, 1487, the Battle of Kopystrzyn in Podolia took place, in which the Tatars were defeated. On March 23, 1489, a two-year truce was signed between Poland and Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II, and on January 25, 1491 the Battle of Zaslaw in Volhynia took place, in which Polish forces destroyed a Tatar raid. In 1494 King Olbracht began military preparations for a new raid, despite a three-year truce, signed on April 6 of that year. Moldovan ruler Stephen III promised to help the Poles as soon as they reached Black Sea ports. It took Poland three years to complete preparations. Their army was made of Polish Crown forces, aided by a number of foreign mercenaries, 400 Teutonic Knights under Grand Master Johann von Tieffen, and a 600 strong unit from Mazovia. Altogether, the Polish army was some 40,000 strong, with 200 cannons. Polish units of pospolite ruszenie gathered in May‚ÄìJune 1497 in Podolia, and in early August of that year, the army crossed the Dniestr river, entering Moldavia. The Poles were taken by surprise by Moldavian ruler Stephen III. On September 24, 1497, the Polish army began the siege of Suceava, which was a failure, and on October 19 the Poles began to retreat. A week later, on October 26, the Poles were defeated in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. The Polish raid provoked Ottomans and Tatars to invade the southeastern corner of Poland. This took place in spring 1498: after crossing the Dniestr, the invaders ransacked Red Ruthenia, capturing thousands of people and reaching as far as Przeworsk. In the summer of that year, the Tatars again invaded Poland, mainly Podolia and Volhynia.  Truce  On July 13, 1498, King Jan Olbracht signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Hungary, in which both sides agreed to cooperate against the Ottomans. On August 15, 1499, Stephen III accepted the truce, and on October 9, 1503, King Aleksander Jagiellonczyk signed a five- year peace treaty with Sultan Bayezid II.

Truman. Wallace Harry Graham was born to James Walter Truman library Graham oral history and Elizabeth (Veneman) Graham on October 9, 1910, in the northeast Kansas town of Highland. In 1919, he moved with his family to Kansas City, Missouri, where his father, a physician opened a practice. Graham graduated from Paseo High School in 1928, and attended the University of Missouri for one year. He transferred to Warrensburg State Teachers' College (now University of Central Missouri) where he completed his B.S. degree in 1932. Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, awarded him a medical degree in 1935 after which he completed internships at Kansas City (MO) General Hospital, Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston; and, Cook County General Hospital, Chicago. In 1938, Dr. Graham completed post-graduate work in pathology and surgery at the University of Vienna and Vienna General Hospital and V√°rosi Hospital, Szeged, Hungary, the University of Budapest. While there, a German S.S. Officer attempted to recruit Dr. Graham into the German Army. Dr. Graham helped several Austrian Jewish families immigrate to the United States, saving them from the Holocaust. In 1939, he attended the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, Scotland before returning to Kansas City to practice with his father. There, he served on the surgical staffs of Kansas City General Hospital, Research Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospitals. Dr. Graham joined the US Army as first lieutenant on October 4, 1941, serving at Fort Leavenworth (KS), Ft. Leonard Wood (MO), and Ft. Warren (WY), and shipped overseas from Memphis, Tennessee. In 1943, he was assigned to the London University and Hammersmith Hospital for advanced surgical training required for combat duty. In June, 1944, he jointed the Normandy Invasion with the 24th Evacuation Hospital, landing on Omaha Easy Red Beach D-Day +4. He later served with the 51st Field Hospital, the 2nd Armored Division and with the 101st Airborne Division. He was first wounded at Nijmegen, Holland, on October 30, and received three additional wounds in subsequent battles. After recovering, he served the 9th Army as Chief on Surgeons in the 97th Evacuation Hospital. He attended the wounded of Operation Overlord, Operation Torch, Operation Market Garden, and the Battle of the Bulge. On at least two occasions, Col. Graham, who was fluent in German, \\"talked down\\" German soldiers intent on killing or capturing him. On one occasion, Col. Graham single-handedly \\"captured\\" a detail of starving German soldiers and led them back to the Allied Lines where they were fed, then sent to prisoner of war camps. He was present at the liberation of Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and among the first physicians to treat the prisoners. While in Stuttgart, General Harry Vaughn ordered Col. Graham to Potsdam, a suburb of Berlin. In an interview, General Vaughn asked Col. Graham if he would like to be the personal physician to the President of the United States. He responded that he would not because he felt the President needed a general practice physician who was older and more experienced. Additionally, he wanted to care for more than one person, so he returned to his unit. The following day, he was once again summoned to General Vaughn who sternly reminded him he was in the US Army and took orders from superior officers. Thus, Col. Graham began his duty as Personal Physician to the President. While in Potsdam, he provided medical care to the President, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. Once back in the States, President Truman arranged for Col. Graham to not only serve as his physician but perform surgery at Walter Reed Army Hospital, and later as a professorial lecturer in surgery at Georgetown University, Washington D.C. Additionally, Col. Graham provided care for visiting heads of state and senior White House staff. In September, 1946, President Truman nominated him for the rank of Brigadier General. By the end of the war, General Graham had received the following international decorations for medical care to the wounded: Belgium, the Order of Leopold II, Grand Officer and Croix de Guerre with Palm; Greece, Order of the Phoenix, Grand Officer; France, Legion d'Honneur, Commander and Chevalier; Dominican Republic, Order of Juan Pablo Durante, Grand Officer; Cuba, Order of Carlos Finlay, Grand Officer; Brazil, Order of Military Merit, First Class; Nicaragua, Order of Military Merit, First Class; Peru, Medical Distinction; Mexico, Medical Citation and Medical Distinction. While serving the President, General Graham performed surgery at Walter Reed Army Hospital in the mornings, and then spent the afternoons and evenings at the White House. Each day, General Graham would perform a medical review of the President's health, then consult on healthcare issues, treat patients and represent the White House at official functions. President Truman regularly assigned General Graham to lead medical missions on behalf of the United States Government. His 1953 mission to Saudi Arabia was a most medically and diplomatically complicated one. The Ambassador to Saudi Arabia requested medical care for King Ibn Saud for a growth on his head/neck and severe arthritis. In a matter of days, General Graham, working with the staff of Walter Reed Army Hospital, organized a complete medical and surgical unit with specialists, technicians and equipment to be flown to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Prior to performing King Saud's operation, a Saudi General warned General Graham that if the surgery was not successful, General Graham would be killed. The surgery was successful and General Graham and his staff subsequently treated the entire Royal Family, cementing cordial Saudi ties to the US. Other notable medical missions included trips to Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Brazil. Having become close friends, Dr. Graham continued to care for President and Mrs. Truman until their deaths. Each Sunday afternoon, he visited the Trumans at their Independence, Missouri, home conducting routine check ups. Additionally, Dr. Graham maintained a busy surgical practice at Research Hospital in Kansas City, MO. Being a Kansas City Golden Gloves Champion in the 1930s, he supported the boxing organization throughout his life and served as physician to his son's wrestling team. Dr. Graham married his childhood sweetheart, Velma (Hill), and together they raised three children, Wallace Scott Graham, Heather Graham Foote, and Bruce Graham. Those who knew him, described Dr. Graham as a man of high integrity and who was extremely positive, out-going and somewhat mischievous. He embraced each life experience as an opportunity and adventure. Dr. Wallace Graham died on January 4, 1996, and is buried in Mt. Moriah Cemetery in Kansas City, MO.Memoirs of Wallace H. Graham, Citizen, Soldier and Surgeon, edited by Sandra L. Colyer In April 1950 President Truman sent Graham with a medical team to visit and assist King Ibn Saud, who, among other things, suffered from severe arthritis. The response from Riyadh was favorable, and the visit helped cement relations between the United States and the Saudi kingdom, which had been strained by the US recognition of Israel.

As the official militia of the state, the Delaware State Guard was created with the intent of acting as a stateside replacement for the Delaware National Guard while the National Guard units were deployed abroad. History of predecessor units Prior to the Militia Act of 1903 and the subsequent creation of the National Guard of the United States, the United States maintained a small full-time, professional military and largely relied on state militias to provide for the nation‚Äôs defense. These state militias would eventually evolve into the National Guard and their stateside parallels, the state defense forces, and both organizations trace their lineage directly to the state militias which operated prior to the creation of the modern-day National Guard. The first militia in Delaware was formed when Swedish settlers took up arms to defend Fort Christina (which was at the time a Swedish settlement) against Dutch invaders. During the American Revolutionary War, Delaware raised several units of militia in support of the Patriot side of the war. In the War of 1812, all of the Delaware volunteer units saw combat at Lewes, where they comprised the majority of force that drove off a British naval squadron seeking control of the Delaware River. Despite the federal government initially prohibiting volunteer units the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, a volunteer unit raised in Delaware would serve in the battles of Contreras, Cherubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec, losing so many men that the unit was nicknamed \\"The Bloody 11th.\\" During the American Civil War, Delaware would raise multiple units in support of the Union cause. These units would earn distinction in the battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the 1st Delaware Volunteer Infantry was mustered into federal service but not deployed abroad. With the passage of the Militia Act of 1903, all state militia units were folded into the National Guard of the United States, largely turning the state militias from a state-funded and controlled force to a reserve component of the federal military. World War I In response to the possibility that the states would prove vulnerable to invasion, insurrection, natural disasters, rioting, and other threats if the National Guard were to be federalized upon entry of the United States into World War I, Congress passed the Home Defense Act in June 1917 to allow the creation of state defense forces, or Home Guards. These units were solely funded and trained by the state, and could not be federalized or be deployed outside the state's borders. The Delaware Home Guard was created in February 1917 in order to assume the stateside duties of the Delaware National Guard during their deployment abroad. Under General Order #10, issued by Delaware‚Äôs adjutant general, one infantry company and a supply detachment were created, consisting of four officers and seventy-one enlisted men. Prior to the passage of the National Security Act of 1920, whenever National Guard units were federalized, these National Guardsmen would be automatically discharged from the National Guard and reenlisted into federal service, and rather than being returned to the state‚Äôs National Guard upon completion of enlistment they were instead discharged from the military altogether; therefore, in the aftermath of the war, the Home Guard was the only military force under Delaware‚Äôs control until the reformation of the Delaware National Guard and dismissal of the Home Guard. World War II In 1940, Section 61 of the National Defense Act of 1916 was modified to again allow the establishment of state defense forces. At the state level, the Delaware General Assembly passed legislation on April 14, 1941 \\"to provide for the Creation, Maintenance, Discipline, Legislation and Use of the Delaware State Guard\\" The Delaware State Guard was formed in May 1941 under control of Colonel J. Paul Heinel, a World War I veteran. =Training= Training and drills were conducted on a weekly basis, and during summer encampments where units would train together as a cohesive organization. The first field encampment was held at Fort DuPont from July 31 until August 8, 1943. Before organizing annual summer encampments, the commissioned officers and NCOs conducted training at St. Andrews School in Middletown, in August 1942, consisting of target practice, military tactics, and army regulations. Training for state guardsmen included practicing night patrols, firing Tommy guns, proper wear of gas masks, field exercises, learning the basics of modern warfare. They attended classes, watched training films on first aid, and practiced battle formations. =Membership= The Delaware State Guard began as one battalion, but through the war it grew to a regiment with two battalions numbering some 450‚Äì500 men with seven line companies of soldiers. Members were drawn from youth in high school who were too young to be inducted into the military, men who were too old to serve in the military, those of the draft age who were for any reason found unfit for federal duty, and men of the draft age who were waiting to be drafted. =Equipment= Initially, the Delaware State Guard received 300 1903 Model Springfield rifles from the War Department, though in May 1942 the War Department took back about 100 rifles and replaced them with repeater guard shotguns. The personal equipment issued to every enlisted guardsmen and expected to be brought to training included: a coverall, issue shoes, a helmet liner, a gas mask, a water canteen, a web belt, a bayonet, a denim coat, trousers and a hat: a raincoat, a rifle, a waist belt, and a revolver. For non-commissioned officers, gear included a khaki cotton shirt, trousers, a tie, a cap, dress shoes, towels, a wash cloth, underwear, socks, a tooth brush and paste, a bathing suit, a shaving outfit, soap, shoe polish and a rag, a comb and brush, and a small mirror. After the war, the Delaware State Guard received surplus equipment from the federal armed forces, including eight jeeps and an ambulance from Fort Dix, New Jersey in August 1945. Additionally, in June 1946, the State Guard received its own waveband from the FCC in order to provide radio communication among all the units in the state. Previously the State Guard had been forced to rely upon borrowed State Police radios for maneuvers and for radio cars. =Duties= As a state defense force, the Delaware State Guard served as internal troops who could be responsible for the stateside duties of the National Guard, including disaster relief, riot control, repelling an invasion, halting insurrection, and protecting infrastructure against sabotage. Guardsmen were expected to attend weekly training sessions as well as summer encampments for further training. Although the Guard never had to repel an invasion or quell a riot, units from the Guard were called up on June 10, 1945 when an Army Air Force plane crashed near Newark. The Guard was assigned to guard the wreckage until the it was removed to New Castle Army Air Base. Disbandment The Delaware State Guard was disbanded on January 3, 1947 at a public ceremony at the Wilmingon Armory. Legal Status State defense forces are permitted by the federal government under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. Currently, 23 states and the territory of Puerto Rico take advantage of this legislation by maintaining active state defense forces. Delaware law also allows for the creation and maintenance of state defense forces by the governor of Delaware under Title 20, Chapter 3 of the Delaware Code. Given the legal framework at both state and federal level, it is possible for the Governor of Delaware to reactivate the Delaware State Guard.

The Billboard Twitter Real-Time charts were four interactive Billboard music magazine charts debuted on May 27, 2014. The charts ranked trending songs from popular and emerging artists based on how often they are mentioned in messages called \\"tweets\\" sent by social networking site Twitter in the United States. The charts \\"Trending 140\\", \\"Emerging Artists\\", \\"Weekly Top Tracks\\" and \\"Weekly Emerging Artists\\" were reported to define how fans interacted with, and influenced, popular content by ranking the most popular songs being shared on Twitter in the U.S. The first two charts updated on a \\"real-time\\" minute-by-minute basis, with the last two charts providing weekly summaries. In August 2017, for the charts dating September 2, the \\"Trending 140\\" and real-time charts were discontinued and the Emerging Artists chart was revised to become a \\"breakout\\" of the overall Artist 100 chart, highlighting the top-performing rising acts of each week. History =2014: Charts created= These charts, for Billboard, represented an ongoing attempt to incorporate new-music consumption and sharing technologies in its charts. In 2013, Billboard added YouTube plays to its Billboard Hot 100 formula, alongside its Social 50 that already tracked which artists are most active on social networks, and included data from Twitter. For Twitter, it was a follow-up to its failed Apple \\"#music\\" app, launched in April 2013 to track music on Twitter, which intended to acquaint users with new acts and see what their contacts were listening to. The app had a \\"Popular\\" page, showing music trending across Twitter, and an \\"Emerging\\" page, showing \\"hidden talent found in tweets.\\" On March 21, 2014, the \\"Twitter Music\\" account wrote that the app would discontinue on April 18, and said in another tweet, \\"We continue to experiment with new ways to bring you great content based on the music activity we see every day on Twitter.\\" On March 27, 2014, Billboard and Twitter announced the partnership for the Billboard Twitter Real-Time Charts, and Twitter Amplify to help with chart distribution; along with custom in-Tweet charts and a weekly in-Tweet video round up of the week in music. Music is one of the most popular topics on Twitter, and music acts routinely dominate its list of the most popular personalities on the service, with most of the top accounts being musicians. Billboard President John Amato said ‚ÄúTwitter, for us, felt like the right way to capture real time more than anything else that we could think of,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the only people that have true scale in real time. Facebook is a behemoth.\\" Austin Mahone's performed his single \\"Shadow\\" at the May 27, 2014, New York City launch event for the Billboard Twitter Real-Time charts and charted at number one on the real-time Trending 140 chart on the same day. \\"Under Control (Calvin Harris and Alesso song)\\" featuring Hurts was the first song to top the weekly (Billboard) Twitter Top Tracks chart on May 24, 2014. K Camp's \\"Cut Her Off\\" featuring 2 Chainz was the first number one for the weekly Emerging Artists chart on June 7, 2014. At the end of 2014, the first year for the charts, hip- hop was the most popular genre of music on Twitter and topped many of the year-end Billboard charts. Rapper Bobby Shmurda's \\"Hot Nigga\\" (also called \\"Hot Boy\\"), with its popular dance, gave him a number one for the real-time Emerging Artists chart for the year, with 837 peaks at number one, with Dej Loaf following at number two, and K Camp at number three. Chart data collection The \\"Trending 140\\" chart \\"is an up to the minute ranking of songs shared in the U.S., measured by acceleration over the past hour. This chart can be filtered to present a real-time view of the most shared track in the U.S. over the past 24 hours, with a weekly summary presented as the Billboard Twitter Top Tracks chart on Billboard.com and in print in Billboard\\". The chart's name combined a typical Billboard \\"top 40\\" sounding name with 140, for the limit of characters allowed in a \\"tweet\\" and for the number of songs the chart tracked. The \\"Emerging Artists\\" chart \\"is a ranking of the most shared songs on Twitter in the U.S. by up-and-coming artists (defined as artists with fewer than 100,000 Twitter followers who have also not appeared as a lead artist in the top 50 songs on the Billboard Hot 100)\\", \\"ranked by the number of times each song was shared over the past 24 hours. The weekly ranking chart, \\"Weekly Emerging Artists\\", is, also, ranked over a seven-day period\\". Songs that are shared or mentioned on Twitter are tracked and incorporated into the charts by the following criteria: \\"the use of, or the inclusion, of a link to the song via music listening platforms, such as Spotify, Vevo and iTunes; the use of various track sharing notations, such as a hashtag ‚Äú#nowplaying‚Äù or ‚Äú#np,‚Äù along with song/artist name; and the use of various terms associated with the song and song playing, such as ‚Äúmusic,‚Äù ‚Äúsong,‚Äù ‚Äútrack,‚Äù ‚Äúlisten.‚Äù =2017: Emerging Artists chart revised, others discontinued= Starting with Billboard charts dated September 2, 2017 and released online August 22, all of the Billboard Twitter charts except for Emerging Artists were discontinued. A revamped Emerging Artists chart was modeled after the same formula as the Artist 100 chart which debuted in 2014 and captures the breakout artists not on that chart. It measures artist activity across Billboards \\"most influential charts\\", including Billboard Hot 100, Billboard 200 and the Social 50. And, unlike the original Billboard Twitter Emerging Artists chart, which ranked with song titles of the weekly most shared songs on Twitter by new artists, the new Emerging Artists chart ranks only by artist, without listing a song or album. New methodology The new chart \\"incorporates key metrics of music consumption, blending album and track sales, radio airplay, streaming and social media fan interaction to provide a weekly multi-dimensional ranking of artist popularity\\". And the revised chart will \\"exclude artists that have notched a top 25 entry on either the Hot 100 or Billboard 200, as well as artists that have achieved two or more top 10s on Billboard's \\"Hot\\" song genre charts that blend streaming, airplay and sales data (such as Hot Country Songs, Hot Rock Songs, Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Latin Songs) and/or consumption-based \\"Top\\" album genre rankings (including counterpart charts Top Country Albums, Top Rock Albums, Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums and Top Latin Albums)\\".

The attraction's opening was enthusiastically welcomed by then- Michigan Governor, John Engler and was described as a \\"major tourist attraction\\" to which the \\"State of Michigan contributed approximately $2.8 million\\". The space featured a range of exhibits with information about the company, its history, and its products. It also included a restaurant, the Red Onion Grill, modelled on and named after the original diner at the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Visitor numbers and closure The venture's original proponents claimed the attraction would attract more than 400,000 visitors each year. In actuality, visitor numbers peaked in 1998 (the year it opened) at 162,000 guests. From 2000 to 2005, it attracted an average of 86,203 visitors each year. In 2006, it had only 75,500 visitors and it closed in January 2007. According to operators, it needed at least 100,000 annual visitors to remain financially viable. The city of Battle Creek was \\"left with an $875,000 bill for the closed attraction\\" but Kellogg's itself bought the building for $2 million, wiped the debt, converted it into commercial office space and sold it the following year. In 2011, the building was donated to Battle Creek Public Schools. https://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/2/prweb8147482.htm See also *Will Keith Kellogg References Category:Kellogg's Category:Battle Creek, Michigan Category:Defunct tourist attractions in the United States Category:Tourist attractions in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:1998 establishments in Michigan Category:2007 disestablishments in Michigan ","title":"Kellogg's Cereal City USA"},{"id":"42884354","text":"Tomakin is a small seaside village on the south coast of New South Wales between the major towns of Batemans Bay and Moruya.

According to Newton's second law, a body has zero acceleration when the vector sum of all the forces acting upon it is zero. Therefore, an equilibrant force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the resultant of all the other forces acting on a body. The term has been attested since the late 19th century.  Example  Equilibrant force example Suppose that two known forces are pushing an object and an unknown equilibrant force is acting to maintain that object in a fixed position. One force points to the west and has a magnitude of 10 N, and the other points to the south and has a magnitude of 8.0 N. By the Pythagorean theorem, the resultant of these two forces has a magnitude of approximately 12.8 N, which is also the magnitude of the equilibrant force. The angle of the equilibrant force can be found by trigonometry to be approximately 51 degrees north of east.

The production is also supported by Jar Pictures, M.R Filmworks and Media Mill. The film is set in Thiruvananthapuram city and It stars Farhaan Faasil and Ahaana Krishna in lead roles.It was their debut movie as hero and heroine. Plot  Steve (Farhaan Faasil) is a college kid whose major concern in life is how to tell his childhood friend Anjali (Ahaana Krishna) that he loves her. He has an iPhone, is on WhatsApp all the time, goes out drinking with his friends and generally lives a carefree life made all the more secure by the fact that Steve's father George is a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Thiruvananthapuram. This idyll is smashed when one day, Steve witnesses a stranger being attacked by men with scythes. Steve isn't able to stop them, but when the attackers leave their victim for dead, Steve takes the injured man to the hospital. It's here that he realizes there is more than what meets the eye. The man he helped is from a criminal gang and it's evident that George is very unhappy that his son has got mixed up in all this. Steve's misgivings intensify when he's called to the police station to identify the attackers in a lineup and none of the men he'd seen are in that lineup. On his way back from the police station, Steve spots one of the scythe-wielding men in a car and decides to follow him. The man whom Steve is following, Hari (Sujit Shankar), seems to be unaware of the college kid tailing him, but of course, that's not really the case. Two of Hari's men knock out Steve. When he comes to his senses, Steve finds himself bound and gagged in a room that overlooks Hari's home. Things become murkier when Hari says he's going to let Steve go and Steve realizes that Hari knows his father. All Steve wants to do is the right and humane thing by the people he encounters, but his acts of kindness just serve to muddle up the situation he's in terribly. Steve realises George and the police force are somehow involved with the gangs and are playing sides, possibly to maintain a peaceful status quo. However, no matter how many times Steve asks, George won't explain to his son precisely how the police are handling the situations. Inevitably, Steve realises that the bad guys have human sides and the police have terrible secrets, but no one has answers to the questions that Steve has. The more he investigates this case in which he has unwittingly become a critical pawn, the more dangerous things turn for him. Aside from Steve, no one seems blameless and yet, he is the one who seems to be suffering the most. Although some of the sequences, like the one in which Steve follows Hari home, can feel a little tedious, the film's tension is sustained by the mystery of how the police are connected to the gangs and whether Steve will be able to find answers to the questions his father refuses to even acknowledge.

However, the day of the online release the movie suffered from piracy attacks and was uploaded to torrent sites. The online release partner, Reelmonk, was, however, able to track the uploader within 12 minutes and has initiated criminal proceedings against the pirate.\\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/Reelmonk-Tracks-Down- Pirates/2015/07/24/article2937098.ece\\" Reception The film was very well received by critics like Baradwaj Rangan. But the lack of commercialization made it a failure in the box office. It had since gone through a series of festival circuits gaining more critical acclaim. Finding audience online, now the film has a cult following and is considered Rajeev Ravi's best work among his three films.

It is hosted by the Historisches Museum Bremerhaven. The database contains information about individuals who emigrated during the period of 1820-1939 mainly through German ports towards the United States. The aim of the GED is to make the collected data available to historical and social science research worldwide. Furthermore, the GED enables socio-statistical evaluations of emigrant data. In addition, the GED allows interested people to look for immigrant ancestors. The German Emigrants Database is financed by private donations and income generated by the database. Thus it receives no public subsidy. The revenues will be used entirely for the further expansion of the database. Legal and financial holder of the GED is the charitable ‚ÄúAssociation of Friends of the Historisches Museum Bremerhaven e.V.‚Äù  Passenger manifests  Passenger manifest from 1853 The data collected is based on the passenger manifests of the emigrant ships. These lists had to be presented to the American immigration authorities upon arrival in the United States. Depending on the requirements of the U.S. immigration policy the detailedness of the data collected changed. At the beginning of the 19th century 14 specific items of information were collected on the passenger manifests by the respective immigrants. At the beginning of the 20th century, already 40 specific items of information were collected. As a rule, age, sex, occupation, country of origin, name of the ship, departure, arrival ports and the arrival date were recorded in the United States. In the German Emigrants Database the information of the passenger manifests is supplemented by other sources, such as certificates and civil registers. Since the 1980s, passenger lists are recorded electronically in the United States. One leader in data digitization was the \\"Center for Immigration Research\\" at the University of Philadelphia/ Pennsylvania. The German Emigrants Database has received its extensive overall data for the years 1850-1891 from the Center for Immigration Research. The GED accesses the electronic recording of the passenger lists provided by the National Archives of the USA since 1999. The GED has not yet been completed, but keeps on completing its data. Currently, it contains the data of around 5 million emigrants. This data covers the periods of 1820-1897, 1904 and 1907.  Data quality Since passenger manifests are hand-written forms, there are great discrepancies in quality. The readability can be affected by damage of the paper, illegible manuscripts, deletions or corrections. In addition, entries are sometimes not unique to a person. For example, some first and last names may occur several times. Often, the information is based on verbal statements of the passengers. Thus, some typical mistakes that occurred due to misspelling or mishearing might still be part of the lists used. Model emigrant ship \\"COLUMBIA\\" Research Visitors to the Historisches Museum Bremerhaven have the possibility to conduct a personal research at two terminals in the museum's exhibition hall. It is also possible to issue a research contract for the GED. Online research in the GED is possible since 2007. This sort of research offered is grated by fees depending on the emigrated person, family or group requested. Unless noted otherwise, the user receives a certificate to any person found with the traditional data of emigration, after the research is completed.

Seva is one of the islands forming the archipelago of the Keta Lagoon. It covers an area of approximately 2.7 square miles. This island is important as a bird-watching site because it is a stopover point for many migratory birds. The town has many attractions such as the sandy beaches, general cleanliness and local storytelling in Ewe. Historians are unable to determine a date for the founding of the town.  History of Seva  The people of Seva are part of the Ewe who migrated from Notsie in the Republic of Togo Seva is divided into the north (Adziehe) and South (Anyiehe) divisions. However, one can construct a time frame from oral tradition and artefacts especially about those of the early chiefs and wars. The settlement must have begun before 1700. There are three Chieftaincy Stools in Seva, namely Lotsu Makwa, Adzomani and Adoblanui-Xornyo Stools. The Lotsu Makwa Stool is the Dufia Stool or Senior Chief Stool. Its occupant, Lotsu Makwa IV, has abdicated, but which abdication is not recognized by the Anlo Traditional Council. The current occupant of the Adzomani Stool is Togbi Adzomani II, while the Adoblanui-Xornyo Stool has a regent, Gabriel Agbewole (Abbeworle), the last occupant of the Stool, Togbi Atsapo-Xornyo, known in private life as Richard Kofi Atsakpo, having died on December 24, 2013. The island was important as a bird watching site. It is inhabited by a large community of Anlo-Ewe-speaking people. Their major vocation is kete cloth weaving. They also are engaged in fishing. The AME Zion Church was the first to establish its presence in Seva and came along with a school which now serves the junior high school level.<> The AME church has got a stronghold in the town and has created a school. The town has many attractions including local storytelling in Ewe which is undertaken as a pastime activity The greatest challenge of the town is lack of pipe-borne water.(http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php?) All inhabitants of Seva township harvest rain water and store it in tanks for use by the households and the schools. Short history of church and school A short history of the A.M.E. Zion Church (Revival Society) and the A.M.E. Zion Basic School, Seva Introduction Until recently, when a road was carved through from Konu, near Anyako, Seva was a complete island surrounded by a body of brackish water‚Äï the Keta Lagoon. Seva was, then, separated from Anyako by about three-quarters of a kilometer of lagoon water. As far back as 1857, the Bremen Mission had already opened a school and a church at Anyako. As late as 1937 Seva was still without a school and a church. Thus, before the late 1930s, citizens of Seva who were determined to receive formal education had to commute between Seva and Anyako, either by canoe or by fording the lagoon to and from school. The first school children Among those determined school children were Lotsu, Zaney, Hukporti, Kumordzi, Beckley, Tay, Womoakor, Ametamenya, Dzimabi and Abiemo. The others were Adadevo, Kudekor, Agezo, Doe and Dellor. In 1917, there was a heavy flooding of the lagoon waters which rendered fording to and from school at Anyako impossible, hence these school children relocated to Keta to continue their education. Around this time, the Salvation Army Church had begun to establish its presence in Seva under the leadership of one Godwin Segbawu from Woe. As time went on, this group of children (now educated young men) formed an association called the Seva Literacy Club with the objective of bringing western education to Seva‚Äïand through the initiative of the Club, the Salvation Army started a school in N.B Zaney's house at Seva. However, at a point, the Club could no longer afford the monthly remuneration of thirty (30) shillings it had agreed to pay Mr Segbawu for his services as a teacher. This sent the Salvation Army Church packing off after three years of missionary work and after having started a school in Seva. Towards the end of 1937, consultations began with the African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Zion Church after the Bremen Mission had declined the request to establish a church in Seva. A delegation under the leadership of N.B. Zaney went to see Rev. Alfred A. Adjahoe, the then Presiding Elder, Bishop's Deputy and Pastor-in-Charge of the St John A.M. E. Zion Church, Keta, with the request which was approved after meeting with members of the church cabinet, officers and leaders. Arrival of the A.M.E Zion Church at Seva In May 1938, Rev. Alfred A. Adjahoe and his team of pastors, officers and the leaders came to Seva together with the citizens of Seva residing at Keta, i.e., N. B. Zaney, J. B. Kumordzie, N. B. Lotsu, Gershon Kwakuga Abiemo and Gershon K. Ocloo, among others, to perform the ceremony for the establishment of the church and school. Three Reverend Ministers of the A.M. E. Zion Church followed in succession to begin work on planting the A.M.E. Zion Church in Seva. Reverend Adjahoe was followed by Reverend J.K.O. Lavie as the first pastors of the A.M.E. Zion Church, Seva. Then came Reverend Albert Sevor from Agavedzi who made a significant contribution to the laying of the foundations of the church in Seva. Rev. Sevor started with zeal and led the school children and a few other persons of the town, instructing them in the word and teaching them the Creed, the Lord ‚Äôs Prayer and the Commandments. By the close of 1938, the first group of Christians were baptized by Rev. Alfred A. Adjahoe and the second group in early 1939, all of whom were later received into full communion by the same Reverend Adjahoe. Acquisition of land for the church and the school In 1939, Amega Agbavitor Alorgbodzi, a citizen of Seva, who was then residing at Ehi, one of the 36 townships of Seva, heard about developments in his hometown, Seva, and being the head of the Alorgbodzi family, returned to Seva to support a worthy cause by offering a portion of his family land on which he had planted coconut trees to be used for building the church and school. The records indicate that Rev. Adjahoe wanted an outright purchase of the land together with the coconut trees but Amega Alorgbodzi declined the request and it was agreed that the land was a gift, but the coconut trees and their fruits belonged to the original landowner in perpetuity. Soon after the acquisition of the land, a chapel and the school were put up with clay, roofed with iron roofing sheets and the walls painted with coaltar. Reception into Conference Rev. Sevor's work was continued by three other ministers‚ÄïW.M. Helegbe from Woe, J.S. Sosu from Tegbi and one Mr Pomeyie. In 1942, under the missionary Pastor, Bro. J.S. Sosu, and the circuit Pastor, Rev. J.K.O. Lavie, the church was received into Conference. Church Membership During the years of Pastors J.S. Sosu and Armstrong, membership increased and the majority of the town folks were baptized. However, due to the school children leaving the town to continue their education at other schools at Anyako and Keta, and the fact that some of the children could not get admission into Zion schools and, therefore, had to join the denominations of the schools where they gained admission, membership of the A.M. E. Zion Church at Seva dwindled. Destruction of the chapel and the school building In 1963/64, there was another great flooding of the Keta Lagoon which destroyed both the chapel and the school buildings. Fortunately, the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development came to the aid of the church by providing a quantity of cement and roofing sheets for the reconstruction of the school. Deprived of a chapel, the congregation worshiped in one of the classrooms. Later, a committee was then formed with Rev. Jasper K. Atsakpo as chairman, assisted by Bro. James Dzimabi to explore avenues for putting up a new chapel. Mr. E.B. Zaney was the first to donate fifty-five (55) bags of cement which were molded into blocks for the construction of the chapel. Other donations for the chapel building project were made on Easter Sunday services through appeals for fund. Sod cutting for the start of the chapel building was done by Rev. E.K. Pomeyie, assisted by Rev. J.M.K. Atsakpo while the foundation stone was laid by Rev. J.B.C. Adjavor, the then Presiding Elder of the Agbozume District. Picture of sod cutting The building of the chapel was spearheaded by Rev. James Kwami Dzimabi, the first ordained resident-native pastor of the church. Establishment of middle school At the beginning of 1964, formal education at Seva ended at the primary level and products of the primary school had to continue their education at Anyako or elsewhere. To address the challenge of fording the lagoon to and from Anyako on a daily basis for their middle school education, the Town Development Association, in collaboration with the chiefs of the town, sent a delegation to the District Assistant Director of Education, Keta, in the later part of 1964 to apply for the establishment of a Middle school at Seva. Consequently, a team of officers from the District Education Office was dispatched to Seva for an assessment of the facilities (two classrooms had been put up in readiness for the middle school system). By the beginning of the 1964/65 academic year, permission was granted for the establishment of a middle school in Seva, with Mr Acquayee from Anyako, as the first head teacher who was succeeded by Mr. Zaglago, followed by Mr. A.K. Kongo who was posted to the school to take over the leadership of both the primary and the middle schools. From 1984 to 1987 the primary and middle schools came under different heads, with Mr Victor Tay as head of the middle school and Mr James Kwami Dzimabi as head of the primary school. Upon the introduction of the junior high school concept, Mr Nyonyo was transferred from Kedzi to take over as the first headmaster. When Mr. Nyonyo was transferred, Mr Dzimabi assumed duty as acting headmaster until a substantive head in the person of Mr. Dogbey was posted to Seva. Not long after, Mr Dogbey died and Mr Dzimabi resumed his acting capacity position. After Mr Dogbey, the successive heads were Mr Daniel Ayikutu, Mr TSovi Dzakpasu, Mr Goka and Mr Solomon Senyo who is currently the headmaster. Circuit pastors of the church The following‚ÄïRev. J.K.O. Lavie, Rev. Katriku, Rev. W.A.A. Abormega, Rev. R.E.M. Kwawukumey and Rev. Felix Dodoer‚Äïwere the Circuit pastor of the church Missionary/Assistant pastors of the church Mr A.K. Sevor, Mr W.M. Helegbe, Mr J.S. Sosu, Mr Armstrong, Mr Joseph Hadui Hukporti, Mr S.W.K. Kumah, Mr E.K. Sosu, Mr K. Kumordzi, Mr S.S. Semaha, Mr James K. Atsakpo, Mr A.K. Kongo, Mr Gati, Mr Agbeko, Mr M.K. Mensah, Mr Dellor, Mr Dawuso, Mr Wemegah, Mr James Dzimabi, Mr David Tay-Suka, Sis. Alice Womoakor and Mr Lawson Dumedea had led the church either as missionary or assistant pastors of the church. Currently, Mr Alex Woamekpor and Sis. Rosemond Agorsor are assisting the pastor. It is important to note that all the assistant pastors in reference were or are also teachers of the school. It is equally important to mention that the first ordained pastor of the church, since church planting, was Rev. J.K. Dzimabi. He was followed by Rev. Devine Tay-Suka and Rev. Philip Hlordzi who is currently the Pastor-in-Charge. Achievements of the school and church The church and school, together, produced Ministers of the Gospel, distinguished scholars and other prominent personalities. The most notable of the Ministers of the Gospel are Rev. J.K. Dzimabi, Rev. Godson Ocloo, Rev. Livingstone Torsu and Rev. Francis Busenu Deku while others are on the verge of ordination as ministers and evangelists. Among the distinguished scholars are Dr Daniel Kodzo Avorgbedor and Dr Clement Agezo who are all full professors while several others have attained very high laurels on the educational ladder‚Äïas high as to the Masters level. Other products of the school are well-placed in various vocations and professions within and outside Ghana. Indeed, one can hardly forget to mention Lawyer David Agorsor, a product of the Seva primary and middle school system. The first group of graduates of the middle school were Eva Agorsor, Gershon Torsu, Simon Alemawor, Paulina Agezo, Elizabeth Hukporti, Alice Kumordzi, Lucia Womoakor, Bertha Kudekor, Keneth Doe, Freeman Alemawor, Julius Abiemo, Bradina Sosu, Emmanuel Ziga Kudekor, Daniel Seke Dogbey, Bernard Kofi Hukporti, Francis Kwasi Bokorvi and Brilliant Besa Dzimabi. The last group of the middle school system are Raymond Tsoeke Abiemo, Jacob Kudjo Alorgbodzi, Alex Atsu Dellor, Honour Selasi Dzimabi, Ambrose Kwadzo Hukporti, Isaac Kwami Torsu, Moses Kwasi Torsu, Rose Akos Torsu, Simon Torsu, Kwasi Torsu and John Eklu Anaglate. And, among the firstgroup of JHS graduates in 1990 were Kokui Eunice Akpanya, Vivian Kpodo, Charity Amese, Dora Amewoseanyana, Mawusi Avukpor, Bernice Kwasiwor Ocloo, Besa Kudekor, Peter Fanam Dzaka, Israel Kongo and Ephraim Amese. Outstanding performance of the church choir At a Choir Festival at Keta during the 1991/1992 Annual Conference, the Seva A.M.E. Zion Church Choir, with Sis. Alice Womoakor as conductor, emerged winners. As the choir did not have robes at that time, an appeal for funds was launched by Rev. Jasper M.K. Atsakpo during the 1993 Easter Sunday Church Service which yielded enough funds to procure eighteen robes or choir gowns which were sewn free of charge by Sis. Lorlor Torsu. Challenges Among the challenges facing the school and church are: 1\\\\. Decline in enrollment and membership as the majority of members leave the town after completion of school for further studies or in search of jobs; 2\\\\. Backsliding of members due to peer pressure or family influence; and 3\\\\. Uncompromising stance of traditional authority in compelling the church to succumb to their rules.

Collinsville Station is best known as a merino stud, and historically, has been responsible for about one third of the genetics in the Australian sheep flock. The property was originally established by John Collins in 1889, and later named Collinsville and established as a sheep stud in 1895 with ewes from Koonana.. At his time the property occupied an area of . The Handbury family had purchased the property in 1995 from receivers for 7 million. Collinsville grew 30% in size under the management of the Handburys. Following flooding in the creek in 2011 bones of diprotodon were found on the property. The fossils were taken to the South Australian Museum, who sent a team of scientists to the site where a full adult skeleton was found nearby. The Handbury family put the station on the market to be auctioned in 2013, at which time the property was expected to fetch over 5 million. It was to be sold without the flock of 5,000 sheep it was stocked with at the time, which were relocated to the Handbury's Arcoona property.

Design and development The Kawasaki Ki-78 was a high-speed research aircraft developed to investigate laminar profile wings with high wing loadings. Early in 1938 a high-speed research program was started at the Aeronautical Research Institute of the University of Tokyo for a small single-seat aircraft. The Ki-78, designed at the Aeronautical Research Institute and built at Kawasaki Kokuki Kogyo K.K. to investigate flying behaviour at very high speed, featured a streamlined minimum cross-section fuselage fitted with a licence-built Daimler-Benz DB 601A engine. For short duration power boost methanol/water injection was used, and cooling was improved by a turbine driven cooling fan for the radiators. All-metal construction was used in combination with a small thin wing with a laminar flow profile and a sharp leading edge. Operational history By the outbreak of the war, the whole project was taken over by the Imperial Japanese Army who gave it the military type designation Ki-78. Kawasaki received the order to build two prototypes of the Ki-78, construction of which was started in September 1941. The first was completed more than a year later and was flown for the first time on 26 December 1942. A feasibility study to improve the KI-78 flight performance showed that extensive airframe modifications were needed and consequently the project was officially terminated after the 32nd flight on 11 January 1944; the second Ki-78 was never completed.

It is now owned by AB-InBev and produced at their brewery in Samlesbury, Lancashire. It is notable as one of the first beers to be packaged in cans containing a widget, giving it a creamy draught-style head. In the 1990s, the beer was heavily marketed as The Cream of Manchester in an advertising campaign credited with raising the city's profile. Adverts from 1996 to 1999 featured Melanie Sykes, who is set to return to the adverts in 2017 to mark 21 years since her first advert. Whitbread acquired Boddingtons in 1989, and gave the bitter nationwide distribution and an increased marketing budget. Boddingtons Bitter achieved its peak market share in 1997 and at the time was exported to over forty countries. Interbrew (now AB-InBev) acquired the Whitbread Beer Company in 2000. Strangeways Brewery was closed in 2004 and production of pasteurised (keg and can) Boddingtons was moved to Samlesbury. Production of the cask conditioned beer moved to Hydes Brewery in Moss Side, Manchester until it was discontinued in 2012. History Boddingtons Pub Ale Boddingtons Bitter in its current form was introduced in 1971, brewed at Boddingtons' Strangeways Brewery. The product's increasing popularity drove the growth of the company throughout the 1970s. The Observer commented in 1974 that the product's low price and distinctive flavour afforded it an unusually loyal following. In 1981, the same newspaper commented, > what has stood Boddingtons in good stead is the highly distinctive flavour > of its brews, especially its bitters. In fact, in the North-West, Boddies is > increasingly becoming a sort of cult brew. In 1983, Boddingtons Bitter was distributed in the Home Counties for the first time.Huntingdonshire CAMRA, \\"A Look Back In Time\\" Opening Times Issue 136 Autumn 2008 However with the expansion of production there were complaints that the beer had lost some of its former character. Regardless of these allegations, Boddingtons Bitter accounted for 90 per cent of production at Strangeways Brewery by 1986. The company was acquired by Whitbread in 1989. Whitbread was motivated to fill a gap in its portfolio by owning a credible cask ale brand with a national reputation. Whitbread's superior capitalisation and distribution network allowed it to take the Boddingtons brand nationwide. Boddingtons had been in decline before the Whitbread takeover, and although it retained an almost \\"cult\\" following within its Manchester heartland, only 5 per cent of sales were outside the North West. Whitbread transformed the brand from regional to national, expanding production from 200,000 to 850,000 barrels a year between 1989 and 1995. By 1993 the cask version was outsold only by Tetley and John Smith's, and the majority of sales were outside of the North West. By 1994 it was the fourth-highest selling bitter brand in the country. The canned variant was distributed nationwide from 1990 and was the highest-selling canned bitter in the UK from 1992 until 2000. The beer was officially exported overseas from 1993, initially to Canada.HISTORY OF FIRMS USING PERFINS The rise in sales of the beer coincided with the elevation of Manchester from \\"city of dark, beaten mills to the cultural magnet of Madchester\\". Manchester and the North of England were now fashionable in the public consciousness and rejuvenated from an image of industrial decay. Whitbread chief executive Peter Jarvis commented in 1995 that: Success was attributed to an excellent marketing campaign, and being the first canned ale to be sold with a widget after Guinness. In 1997 Boddingtons sales peaked, and 1998 saw a drop in sales of 10 per cent. Boddingtons had been turned into: \\"a fashion product ... and as with all fashion products, the drinkers moved on\\". Despite this setback, in 1998‚Äì1999 Boddingtons' share of the UK ale market grew to 4.9 per cent, and sales grew by 7.3 per cent in 1999‚Äì2000. In 2000, the Whitbread Beer Company was acquired by the Belgian brewer Interbrew, which owned Stella Artois. At that time one in eight barrels of Boddingtons was exported to some 40 countries worldwide, including China, the United States, Taiwan and the West Indies. The Strangeways Brewery kegging facility closed in 2003 with the loss of 50 jobs. Amidst falling sales, Interbrew relaunched the cask product in the North West of England, with an increased strength. The relaunch was unsuccessful and the changes were reversed. In 2004, the owners (now known as InBev) announced plans to close the Strangeways Brewery and move most production from Manchester to Magor in South Wales and Samlesbury, Lancashire, with the loss of 60 jobs. Boddingtons cask ale production, which accounted for less than 10 per cent of output, was moved to Hydes Brewery in Moss Side. Production ended in 2005 and the brewery was demolished in 2007. In 2010, it was speculated that InBev (known as Anheuser-Busch InBev from 2008 onwards) would attempt to sell the Boddingtons brand to another brewer after its failed attempt to sell the UK rights to Bass ale. The Times was damning of what it perceived as InBev's mismanagement of the brand, which had \\"declined under AB InBev's hands. The brand was once a leading part of the old Whitbread Beer Company, but its fortunes had dwindled since the closure in 2005 of the Strangeways Brewery.\\" In 2010, Boddingtons was the sixth-highest selling bitter in the United Kingdom, although sales had dropped by almost three- quarters since the takeover by Anheuser‚ÄìBusch InBev in 2000.Alcoholic Drinks: Euromonitor from trade sources/national statistics, 2011 In 2011, AB InBev's UK president Stuart MacFarlane claimed \\"We still believe in the brand\\", whilst admitting to not advertising the brand for five years, instead reaping the rewards of memories of earlier advertising. Contract brewing of Boddingtons Cask continued until 2012 when production of the beer ended. Production was around 250,000 hectolitres (6,604,301 US Gallons) in 2012, with around 80 per cent of production destined for the UK market, and around 20 per cent destined for export markets such as Taiwan, Singapore and United Arab Emirates.Alcoholic Drinks: Euromonitor from trade sources/national statistics In 2017, Anheuser‚ÄìBusch InBev announced that it was launching a digital, social, PR and video campaign for Boddingtons featuring Melanie Sykes who had appeared in adverts for the brand in 1997. Variants Boddingtons has a distinctive straw-golden coloured body with a creamy white head, which is achieved by the addition of nitrogen. * Boddingtons Draught Bitter (3.5% ABV) :The nitrogenated and pasteurised variant of the beer available in kegs and cans. It is brewed in Samlesbury. The canned variant, launched in 1991, contains a widget to give the beer a creamy white head. The beer's ABV was reduced from 3.8% to 3.5% in late 2008. On draught in the United Kingdom it is typically served at 5 to 7 degrees Celsius, although an Extra Cold variant served at 3 to 5 degrees Celsius has been available since 2006. Its taste, or perceived lack of it, has been criticised by some, with Andrew Jefford describing it as a \\"blandly foamy nitrokeg travesty of the original [cask conditioned version]\\". * Boddingtons Pub Ale (4.6% ABV) :A higher ABV version of Boddingtons Draught Bitter, brewed since 1993 for export markets.

He is best known for An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff. Colonial administrator Morgann was born in Blaenbylan, Pembrokeshire, but little is known about his family or education, partly because at his request his executors destroyed all his personal papers after his death. He was established in London by 1756 when he was appointed to the sinecure post of Deputy Weigher and Teller at the Royal Mint. In 1757 he produced his first published work, An Inquiry Regarding the Nature and End of a National Militia. This pamphlet promoted Pitt's militia bill and reflected Tory opposition to a standing army and increased taxation. From 1762, Morgann served as personal secretary and political adviser to the Earl of Shelburne, who served as President of the Board of Trade the following year. When Shelburne returned to office as Secretary of State for the South in July 1766, Morgann became one of his four under-secretaries and was given another sinecure, the post of secretary of the Province of New Jersey in November. In 1767, he was appointed special envoy of the Privy Council to Canada and visited Quebec in 1768. Morgann argued for the toleration of Catholicism in the Canadian province and thus contributed to the formulation of the Quebec Act of 1774. He was also opposed to the slave trade, believing it would bring \\"terror and destruction\\" in America. These views were expressed in his Plan for the Abolition of Slavery in the West Indies (1772). In 1782 Morgann embarked to New York with the aim of reuniting the colonies and Great Britain. Congress refused to receive him and it is possible that Morgann's report of the situation in America convinced Shelburne, now Prime Minister, to conclude the treaty with the American Commissioners in Paris which recognized the independence of the former colonies. Morgann returned to England in 1783 and he retired from active duty under Shelburne in 1786. In 1795 he published his Considerations on the Present Internal and External Condition of France. This work called for an alliance between the United States and Britain to meet the threat of French radicalism which Morgann considered to be a dangerous form of anarchy. His analysis met with the approval of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. He died unmarried in March 1802. Literary critic An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff was published in 1777. It belonged to a genre of criticism, well-established at the time, that defended a Shakespeare character against charges of immorality. In this character study, Morgann contradicted Dr Johnson's view of Falstaff as a drunken coward unworthy of admiration. Morgann argued that it was Shakespeare's intention to gain sympathy from the audience for Falstaff at the expense of Prince Hal. Falstaff was in reality a good-natured man of true courage and a coward only in appearance. When he is robbed at Gads Hill, for example, Falstaff does not flee \\"until he had been deserted by his companions, and had even afterwards exchanged blows with his assailants\\". Morgann summarises the complexity of Falstaff: \\"he is a character made up by Shakespeare wholly of incongruities; - a man at once young and old, enterprising and fat, a dupe and a wit, harmless and wicked, weak in principle and resolute by constitution, cowardly in appearance and brave in reality; a knave without malice, a lyar without deceit; and a knight, a gentleman and a soldier, without either dignity, decency or honour\\". According to Boswell, Johnson derided the premise of Morgann's Essay: \\"Why, Sir, we shall have the man come forth again; and as he has proved Falstaff to be no coward, he may prove Iago to be a very good character\\". The work proved, however, to influence greatly the literary criticism of Henry IV, Part I and it inspired the literary approaches of Edward Dowden and A. C. Bradley in particular. Edward Elgar's interpretation of the character for his symphonic poem, Falstaff (1913), also owed much to Morgann's character study.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Congleton, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield, and the diocese of Chester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The church was built in 1863‚Äì64 and designed by George Gilbert Scott. It was commissioned by Randle Wilbraham III of Rode Hall. The family had worshipped at St Mary's Church, Astbury, but Randle III wanted to have a church in Odd Rode. He had previously bought an old chapel in the parish for the purpose, but this was too small, and in 1861 he commissioned Scott to design a new church. Building began in 1863, but Randle III died during the first year of construction, and the church was completed and paid for by his son, Randle Wilbraham IV. It cost nearly ¬£5,914, and was dedicated in 1864. The church continues to be active, and works in association with the other churches in the parish, the Church of the Good Shepherd, Rode Heath, and St Luke's Mission Church, Mow Cop. Architecture =Exterior= All Saints is constructed in rubble with ashlar dressings, and has a tiled roof. Its plan consists of a nave, a south aisle, a chancel, a southwest porch, and a northeast vestry. The west end of the nave is symmetrical and is in three bays divided by buttresses with offsets. In the centre is a doorway with a moulded surround that includes small pillars, and above it is a hood mould, the label stops of which are carved with figureheads, one male, one female. Over the doorway is a gablet with a roundel containing a flower. Above this is a three-light window, and over that is a canopied niche containing a statue of Christ. At the top of the bay there is a double bellcote under a gablet containing a trefoil and surmounted by a weathercock. The lateral bays of the west end of the nave contain lancet windows, and at the corners are buttresses. The west end of the aisle is recessed and contains a three-light window. At its top is a gable containing an octofoil and surmounted by a cross finial. The sides of the church are in four bays divided by buttresses, and each bay contains a two- light window, other than the second bay of the aisle which contains a porch. The porch is gabled and has a pointed arch with semi-octagonal colonettes, a hood mould with figurehead label stops, and a cross finial. On the south side of the chancel is a chapel with a doorway, and on the north side is a gabled vestry. The east window has five lights, the label stops of its hood mould being carved with a bishop and a queen. =Interior= The arcade between the nave and the aisle is carried on quatrefoil piers, and the aisle has a barrel vaulted roof. The chancel arch is flanked by marble columns with foliate capitals. There are more marble columns flanking the east window, and between the chancel and the chapel. Also between the chancel and the chapel is a wrought iron screen with three arched openings. This was made by Skidmore of Coventry. A niche in the chapel contains a terracotta bust of Randle Wilbraham III, carved by A. Carrier-Belleuse in 1854. The octagonal pulpit is in alabaster and has arcades with marble columns containing a mosaic inlay. The font is also in alabaster, and is in the shape of a chalice. The reredos is a memorial to Randle Wilbraham III and his wife, and is based on The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci. The stained glass in the east window is a memorial to Randle Wilbraham IV. It was made in 1864 by the O'Connor firm, and the west window is a Jesse window by C. E. Kempe dated 1908. The pipe organ was made in 1887 by Wadsworth at a cost of ¬£280. The bells for the bellcote were made by Taylor of Loughborough. Appraisal All Saints Church was designated as a Grade II* listed building on 14 February 1967. Grade II* is the middle of the three grades of listing, and is applied to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". The architectural historian Goodhart-Rendel said of the church \\"Taking things all round, I like this best of any Scott church I have seen ... Everything seems to me a triumph of the academic type of good Gothic design ... there is nothing but safety first ‚Äì but it is safety\\". The description of the church in the National Heritage List for England concludes by saying \\"not only the design but the craftsmanship is of high quality\\".

Early life Hooker was born to Eliza Annie Hooker and George Washington Hooker in 1851, and was orphaned at the age of seven. At sixteen years of age she began her working life in a New England cotton factory. After a week in the factory, she sought help in finding a different job. Hooker taught in Vermont public schools (1869-1870) and at the Academy of West Charleston (1870-1871). Academic career Hooker entered Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1871, and graduated in 1873. She did graduate work at MIT, and the universities of Syracuse, Berlin, and Chicago. She earned a Ph.D. from Syracuse University in 1889. Hooker was among the first women to earn a Ph.D. in botany in the United States. In 1899, she was one of two teachers with a Ph.D. at Mount Holyoke. Hooker's research focused on the morphology and embryology of Cuscuta, a genus of parasitic plants. Hooker was a teacher at Mount Holyoke for thirty-five years. As the chair of the botany department, she advocated for expansion of the curriculum into newer branches of the field and for improvements to laboratory space and equipment. Hooker's commitment to Mount Holyoke extended beyond her retirement in 1908. She bred prize-winning Buff Orpington chickens and donated the winnings to Mount Holyoke. Mount Holyoke awarded her an honorary Sc.D. in 1923. Hooker's papers are held by the Mount Holyoke College Archives & Special Collections.

It represented workers in the glove-making and leather industry. History The union was formed in 1920 by the merger of the Amalgamated Society of Glovers and the United Glovers' Mutual Aid Society as the National Union of Glovers (NUG). The union was based primarily in Yeovil and the surrounding areas, a major centre for the glove-making industry in Britain. In 1919 the NUG rejected a proposal from the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives (NUBSO) to amalgamate, on the basis that the NUG's status as the majority union on the Glove Manufacturing Joint Industrial Council (JIC) gave it a strong bargaining position with employers. In 1954 the union changed its name to include workers in the leather industry. In 1971 the NUGLW merged with the Amalgamated Society of Leather Workers, NUBSO and the National Union of Leather Workers and Allied Trades to form the National Union of Footwear, Leather and Allied Trades (NUFLAT).

Founded in 1877, its collection includes works by Aelbrecht Bouts, Joos van Cleve, Anthony van Dyck, Otto Dix and Max Beckmann. History The ' (Aachen museum association) was created in 1877, and in 1883 a city museum was opened in the ' (Old Redoubt) building. It was named the Suermondt Museum, after the founder Barthold Suermondt, who gave 105 paintings from his collection to the city, as well as those from the collection of his sister-in-law Ad√®le Cockerill. This collection, together with many other works which were later sold to Berlin, had been on display in the Suermondt Gallery in Aachen already before the museum was established. In 1901, the museum moved to the , originally owned by the Cassalette family which had acquired fortune through the Aachener Kratzenfabrik Cassalette, which produced raising cards. Over the next decades, the building was slowly extended to house the ever growing museum collection, interrupted by WWII when the collection was stored for safe-keeping in the Albrechtsburg in Meissen. About 200 paintings were missing after the war, but the museum recently recovered two flower paintings; Flowers in a Glass Vase and Flowers in a Wan-Li Vase. The most recent expansion was in 1992 to 1994. Major gifts were received from Anton Ignaz van Houtem and Franz Johann Joseph Bock. In 1977, the name of the museum was changed to Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum to honour Irene and Peter Ludwig, art collectors who donated a significant part of their collection of art (medieval to modern) to the museum that year, after having given permanent loans from 1957 on. Building Interior view of the Villa Cassalette: the central staircase The family Cassalette, rich factory owners in Aachen, asked the architect Eduard Linse to design a city palace in a Renaissance Revival architecture style, inspired by Venetian palaces. The interior of the Villa Cassalette was richly decorated with murals in the Pompeian style, stucco cassettes on the ceilings, and sculptures. Many small changes and extensions were made when the building became a museum in 1901 and afterwards; but much of the original interior has been restored or made visible again since. In 1992-1994, the architecture company Busmann & Haberer designed a large extension, built at the left side of the Villa. Collection The oldest pieces in the collection are German sculptures from the 12th to 16th century. This includes works by Tilman Riemenschneider, Hendrik Douvermann and Arndt van Tricht. Amongst the earliest paintings in the collection is an Adoration of the Magi by the Master of the Glorification of the Virgin and a work by Joos van Cleve. Paintings from the 16th century include a Judith by Luca Cranach the Elder, an Ecce Homo and Mater Dolorosa Diptych by Aelbrecht Bouts and a Mary Magdalen by Cornelis Engebrechtsz.. Major artists from the 17th century who are represented here include from Spain Francisco de Zurbar√°n, Luis de Morales and Jusepe de Ribera and from Italy Bartolomeo Manfredi. The large collection of paintings from Flanders and the Netherlands shows works by Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, Frans Snyders, Jacob Isaacksz van Ruisdael, Frans Hals, Willem Claeszoon Heda, Willem Kalf, Joseph de Bray and Jan Boeckhorst. The modern art collection is largely restricted to artists living or working in Germany, including internationally known ones like Alexej von Jawlensky, Otto Dix, Max Beckmann, August Macke and Andreas Achenbach. Other disciplines on display include a large collection of glass painting, 10,000 works of graphic art by artists like Albrecht D√ºrer, Rembrandt and many others, Flemish tapestries, and works of goldsmiths.

Games have been developed since 2002, mostly independently. However, from 2014, some IT companies have started to develop video games commercially. Some research has been carried out at various universities for the betterment of the video game development sector.  History  Apple Soft IT is one of the first video game companies in Bangladesh, and was established in 2011. It is a game developing company in Bangladesh. Red Cloud 71 was its first product of Applesoft IT. Video gaming was introduced in the country through arcade gaming through a significant growth during the late 1990s because of the availability of personal computers at lower prices. However, the local video game development only started in the early 2000s. Dhaka Racing, a racing video game set in the streets of Dhaka, is the first 3D video game to be developed in the country. The game was designed by two undergraduate students of computer science and was launched independently by eSophers in 2002. Getting a huge response from the gamers across the country, the game eventually paved the way for the local video game development sector. A year later, inspired by the success of Dhaka Racing, a group of computer science students from Chittagong developed Chittagong Racing. In 2004, a first-person shooter game titled Arunodoyer Agnishikha was developed by Trimatrik Interactive, which was based on the events of Bangladesh Liberation War. Being the first Bangladeshi game of its genre, it received widespread acclaim and started a new chapter of video game development in the country. In 2012, a group of students from BRAC University developed Aerial Multi-Player Dogfight which they claimed to be the first massively multi-player online (MMO) game for PCs in the world that responds to body movements and voice command. On 16 December 2012, the first professional game development team after 2004 was formed, named \\"Team 71\\". They started their journey by announcing a first person shooter game named Liberation 71 based on the Bangladesh Liberation war and inspired by the game Arunodoyer Agnishikha. Liberation 71 will contain the actual history and events of the liberation war of 1971. The game is a big project using the Unreal 4 game engine, so it is still under development. Team 71 is called the \\"pioneer of the computer game development\\" era of Bangladesh after 2010. In 2014, Hatirjheel: Dream Begins, an open world action-adventure game, was developed and published by MassiveStar Studio. It was the first commercially published video game in Bangladesh. In 2015, a new game titled The Reels: Welcome to Bangladesh was being developed by another development team named LAI MASSIVE, which was a story based, linear racing game that lets the players drive through from Dhaka to Chittagong. The developers were very young and few in numbers, but made a game of next-generation quality. They also made other games like The Division Sa World At War, The Run, and Night Time Bed. In June 2016, Dream World Studio released a new third person shooter game called Durjoy. Also, a first person shooter game called Hound6: The Escape is being developed by the team as a sequel to Hound6: Strike,Hound6: Strike which was also released in 2016. In 2015, Bangladeshi game developer team \\"The Mascoteers\\" hit the top chart with their game 360 Degree. The game was downloaded more than a million times in both the Google Play Store and iTunes App Store.Google Play Store featured 360 Degree. In 2016, Swiperoo and Dropple by The Mascoteers were downloaded more than a million times in both the Google Play Store and iTunes App Store. Google Play Store featured Swiperoo and Dropple. Many of The Mascoteers' games, including MineBoom, Drumheads, JetFly, Boo Wee, Pogo Jump, Carpenter, Nail It, Mad Head, and Smatch were featured in iTunes' \\"New Games We Love\\" section. On 25 December 2015, a game named Heroes of 71 based Bangladesh Liberation War was released by Mindfisher Games INC. Later on 25 March 2016 a second installment titled Heroes of 71:Retaliation was released. Both the installments were downloaded more than 1 million on play store.

He was born in Nov√Ω Hrozenkov in what is now the Czech Republic and was educated at the Export Academy in Vienna, the London School of Economics and the Sorbonne. After serving in World War I, he joined the family lumber company, becoming head of the company in 1920. In 1922, he married Thea Rosenquist. With the rise of the German Third Reich, Koerner's family abandoned their possessions and business interests; he escaped to London, England and then travelled with his wife to North America. In Vancouver, his wife came down with a severe case of the mumps. While his wife was recovering, Koerner acquired a defunct lumber mill in New Westminster. Founding a timber company with his brothers Theodor, Otto, and Walter, he was able to market western hemlock successfully as \\"Alaska pine\\". The company introduced innovative and progressive practices to the British Columbia forest industry such as selective logging, reforestation, improvements in workplace safety and better wages and benefits. Koerner became a Canadian citizen in 1947. In 1955, he and his wife created a foundation, the Leon and Thea Koerner Foundation, which contributed to education, the creative arts and social programs, particularly in British Columbia. Thea Koerner died in 1959. Leon suffered a stroke in 1966. In May 1972, he suffered a broken hip after a fall and he died later that year at the age of 80 in his penthouse atop the Thea Koerner House Graduate Student Centre of the University of British Columbia.

It is located in a cove on the west side of Moultonborough Neck, in the town of Moultonborough. Built in 1908-10, it is one of the state's most architecturally elaborate boathouses, exhibiting elements of the Tudor Revival and Shingle style. Now used exclusively by the association owners, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Swallow boathouse is located on the west side of Moultonborough Neck, a long finger of land extending into Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire's largest lake. It is set in Kona Bay, an inlet bounded on the north by Swallow Point and the south by Wallace Island. Land access to the boathouse is private via Kona Farm Avenue and Windward Avenue. The structure and neighborhood surrounding it is owned by a private association and is only accessible by water to the general public for viewing. It is a wooden structure long and wide, and is mounted on eight stone piers set in about of water. The boathouse is set back from the shore, and is accessed by a wooden walkway long. A crib of heavy timbers forms its base, with three structural bays topped by an expansive gambrel roof, with cupolas on each section. A portion of the interior, originally open to the water, has been floored over. The boathouse was designed by Harry J. Carlson and built in 1908-10. The walkway was originally sheltered by a roof; that covering and a matching land pavilion have been removed due to storm damage. The boathouse was built to house the Swallow, a large seagoing yacht that was transported to the lake by rail by Herbert Dumaresque, owner of the Kona Farm estate on which the boathouse was located. Its size is more reminiscent of boathouses used for commercial operations, and Carlson appears to have based its design on an 1830s boathouse at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, elaborating it architecturally with Shingle and Tudor features.

Because the subway was originally built by three separate companies, an official map for all subway lines was not created until 1940, when the three companies were consolidated under a single operator. Since then, the official map has undergone several complete revisions, with intervening periods of comparative stability. The current iteration of the New York City Subway map dates from a design first published in 1979. The official map has evolved gradually under the control of the Marketing and Corporate Communications Department of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The 1979 design was created by the MTA Subway Map Committee, chaired by John Tauranac, which outsourced the graphic design of the map to Michael Hertz Associates. Early maps A map for the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), created in 1924. Original maps for the privately opened Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), which opened in 1904, showed subway routes as well as elevated routes. However, IRT maps did not show Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) routes; conversely, BMT maps did not show IRT routes, even after the Dual Contracts between the IRT and BMT. In fact, even in 1939, the year before the unification of the IRT, BMT, and Independent Subway System (IND) into one entity, maps by private businesses were still being printed showing only the routes of one company. The three subway companies also published their own maps, showing their own routes.A History of New York City Subway Maps Routes were not distinguished from each other on subway maps until 1958. The first route maps were aesthetically pleasing, but had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has since become recognized in design circles as a modern classic. However, the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements, specifically in the sense that elements only ran horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. By contrast, the Hertz map, which replaced the Vignelli design in 1979, contained elements that were more curved and \\"organic looking\\" while clarifying the nuances and complexities of the three former systems. The Hertz design, first created by Michael Hertz, remains in use with some stylistic differences and updates reflecting subway expansions since then. In 1985, with the subway's elimination of double-lettered routes, the map also drastically changed; routes on the maps became less straight and more circular, a design that persists today. \\"Trunk lines\\" were rearranged to be one color, rather than the multicolored routes shown on the former Vignelli maps. =Expansion maps= Two maps were drawn that showed routes for a never-built proposed expansion of the New York City Subway: one in 1929 and one in 1939. A subway map was also drawn up in the 1970s to illustrate planned service patterns for an expanded subway system. This map showed possible service patterns upon the completion of several subway lines proposed in the 1968 Program for Action. Unified system maps =1940‚Äì56: Separate companies' maps= After the subway operating companies were taken over by the Board of Transportation in July 1940, maps continued to be issued until 1942 in the characteristic style of the individual companies. Thus the IRT Division issued maps in the style of the former IRT company, and the BMT Division issue maps in the style of the former BMT company. In order to have an integrated design, however, the Board brought in externally produced maps. From 1943 to 1952, the Board purchased stocks of Andrew Hagstrom's maps, overprinted with the Board's service information, and issued them as de facto official maps from token booths (e.g. 1948). In 1953, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) took over the subway from the Board of Transportation. They continued to issue Hagstrom maps as official maps until 1956, but instituted two changes. First: from 1954 onwards, they acquired stocks of subway maps designed by Stephen Voorhies and printed with promotional material for the Union Dime Bank. This was done to save money, as the Voorhies map was free, while Hagstrom charged for theirs. To keep the publications valid, the NYCTA periodically sent updated service information to both Hagstrom and Voorhies to be printed in service tables and, where necessary, incorporated into the map. Second: the NYCTA solicited proposals to create an in-house map design to save money and have more control of the map. =1958 redesign by George Salomon= Old official map designed by George Salomon In 1955, George Salomon submitted a proposal to the NYCTA to redesign not only the map but the entire system of nomenclature.George Salomon (c. 1955), three typescript booklets, held in the Archives of the New York Transit Museum, Brooklyn: (a) \\"Out of the Labyrinth: A plea and a plan for improved passenger information on the New York subways\\". (b) \\"Orientation\\". (c) \\"Orientation on the New York Subway (a ‚Äòscrapbook‚Äô)\\". Salomon was a German √©migr√©, and his proposed system of route names and colors mirrored that of the Berlin U-Bahn. He had also spent a year studying under Eric Gill in England and expressed admiration for the London Underground map. His map adopted the same modernist style as Harry Beck's London map, and was the first map of the New York City Subway to follow a systematic visual language in diagrammatic form. The NYCTA rejected his systematic revision of nomenclature but did use his diagram of lines as its official map from 1958 to 1967. After delivering his map in 1958, Salomon had no further control of it, and disliked the NYCTA's addition of touristic information to his minimalist design,Interview with Mathilde Salomon, widow of George Salomon, in 2004 such as the map of 1964. =1967 redesign for the Chrystie Street Connection= A 2015 subway map by Reka Komoli, reconstructed from a hand-drawn map by Raleigh D'Adamo that was created in 1964 for the NYCTA Subway Map Competition Chrystie Street Service Changes Map To relieve bottlenecks in the subway system, a series of major works were carried out in the 1960s. One of them, the Chrystie Street Connection in Chinatown, Manhattan, had a major impact on the subway map, as it unified the BMT and IND divisions of the subway, thereby rendering obsolete the three-colored network maps that been used since the 1930s. The Transit Authority had to devise a new map design by the time the Chrystie Street Connection opened, so in 1964, they opened the Subway Map Competition to the general public. There were three winners; one of them, R. Raleigh D'Adamo, submitted an explanatory report with his map, which detailed his innovative proposal to color-code the subway by individual routes rather than by historic operating company. This concept was implemented by Dr. Stanley Goldstein of Hofstra University, working as a consultant to the TA, and by Dante Calise, art director at Diamond Packaging, the firm that printed the subway map. On November 26, 1967, when the new connections opened, the new map came into use. There was also a map to explain all the newly rerouted services. =1972 redesign by Massimo Vignelli= Old official map designed by Massimo Vignelli The TA's new map, released in 1967, used Raleigh D'Adamo's principle of color- coding for the first time, but it suffered from what Vignelli called \\"fragmentation\\" and was not well received. The following year, the parent body Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) was formed over the TA, chaired by William J. Ronan, who wanted to create a modern brand image for this new body. While the Unimark signage project was still being finished off up with the creation of the New York City Transit Authority Graphics Standards Manual, Vignelli went to Ronan with a mock-up of part of the map for lower Manhattan. p. 47 Ronan approved it, and in July 1970 the TA awarded Unimark a contract to design a new system map. The map was put together in the Unimark Office by Joan Charysyn under Vignelli's design direction. In April 1971, Vignelli left Unimark to set up Vignelli Associates with his wife and business partner, Lella Vignelli, also a partner in Unimark. By this time, the map was almost complete, but was subject to corrections and modifications requested by Raleigh D'Adamo, who was now Head of the Office of Inspection and Review at the MTA. These changes were carried out by Charysyn, who also oversaw the printing of the map. Unimark's liaison with the MTA during this project was handled by Norbert Oehler. The map was unveiled by Ronan on August 4, 1972 at a ceremony in the station at 57th Street and Sixth Avenue. Starting the following weekend, the maps began to be installed in stations and in subway cars. The maps became available at token booths for riders on August 7. It cost $105,000 to produce. Along with the map, a subway directory was unveiled. This specific one showed how to get from 57th Street to the other subway stations in the system in an alphabetical listing. After the mechanical for the map was handed over in 1972, Vignelli had no further control over the map. Six further editions were produced from 1973 to 1978, with extensive changes. Though critically acclaimed, the subway map proved to be unpopular with many riders. In 1974, William Ronan was replaced by David Yunich as chairman of the MTA. Yunich was formerly an executive at Macy's department store, and brought an explicit intention to 'sell' the subway to riders. He brought over from Macy's Fred Wilkinson who in 1975 formed the Subway Map Committee to design a new map to replace Vignelli's. =1978 redesign by John Tauranac and Michael Hertz Associates= At the end of 1976, Wilkinson was assigned from Transit to be Executive Officer of Surface operations and stepped down from the Subway Map Committee.Minutes of the Subway Map Committee, December 17, 1976. For half a year, the committee did not meet; and then in the summer of 1977, John Tauranac was assigned chair of the committee and meetings resumed.Minutes of Subway Map Committee, June 30, 1977 The committee, working with the design firm Michael Hertz Associates, experimented with designs and in February 1978 Tauranac organized an exhibition entitled \\"The Good, The Bad ... The Better? A New York City Subway Map Retrospective\\" at the Cityana Gallery run by Benjamin Blom, exhibiting the committee's latest prototype map and offering a questionnaire for testing public reaction.New York Times, February 9, 1978, Paul Goldberger, \\"Putting the Subways on a New Map\\" Visitors said they liked the geographic information but disliked the use of a single color for all subway lines.Minutes of Subway Map Committee, March 3, 1978. In response, Tauranac then prepared a version with two colors, blue for the former IRT lines and red for the former BMT and IND lines. This was exhibited at the Cooper Union in April, when Tauranac debated with Massimo Vignelli in a public battle between the two schools of map-making.The Times, May 8, 1978, Michael Leapman, column: \\"Leapman in America\\" The final design used a trunk-colored scheme, in which services running on a common main line, or \\"trunk\\" line, share the same color. Tauranac led the 12-person Subway Map Committee, which comprised TA staff and members of the public and three staff at Michael Hertz Associates.MTA Press Releases #86 and #87, June 24, 1979 Everybody contributed to the final design, and the map cannot be said to be designed by one individual.This statement is based on the existing minutes of the Subway Map Committee and interviews by Peter B. Lloyd with the traceable members of the committee, related MTA staff, and staff of Michael Hertz Associates According to The New York Times, the sculptor and painter Nobuyuki \\"Nobu\\" Siraisi drew sketches for the new version of the map, while psychologist Arline Bronzaft conducted studies to determine riders' responses to the old and new maps. Siraisi rode all of the routes with his eyes closed in order to feel each track curve, which he then drew in a sketchbook. The curves in Siraisi's drawings helped to alleviate a feeling of disorientation that many riders felt when looking at the straight lines of the Vignelli map, as had been observed in Bronzaft's studies. The final assignment of colors was made by Tauranac. The extant minutes of the Subway Map Committee show that Tauranac was responsible for several major design decisions‚Äîsuch as the use of a geographic style, the use of trunk-based color coding, the use of route markers, and the appearance of transfer stations. He also organized and coordinated the contributions of everybody in the group and liaised with TA and MTA staff to get approvals and funding and then to ensure that all the station and car signs in the subway network were changed to match the color scheme of the new map when it was launched. In September 1978, Tauranac met with Phyllis Cerf Wagner, head of the MTA Aesthetics Committee, and told her that the map project was \\"dead in the water\\" because he could not make the map he wanted, since there was no funding to change to signage to match the change in the map. Cerf Wagner was subsequently able to secure the funds.Phyllis Cerf Wagner, interviewed by Barbaralee Diamonstein, September 1978, tapes held at Columbia University In June 1979 the finished subway map was published in time for the Diamond Jubilee, the subway's 75-year anniversary. Paul Goldberger praised the map as \\"the clearest and most usable map the subway system has had in years\\", and one of the bright spots of the subway system, which was then in poor condition. A New York Times editorial said, \\"Not all the news about New York's subways is bad\\", praising the production of a \\"readable subway map\\". Tauranac defended his design in public debates with Massimo Vignelli in April 1978 and December 2010. = Later changes to Tauranac/Hertz map = Initially, there was only an English-language version of the map. In 1991, a multilingual version of the map was printed in six languages commonly used by tourists: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Japanese. Additionally, Staten Island was initially not shown on the map except for a small corner inset. In 1998, a map of the Staten Island Railway was added to that inset. That year, the map was digitized so that it could be edited via computer: in this edition, incongruous small details were removed or revised. Despite the revisions made to the 1998 map, several errors persisted through the 21st century: for instance, the intersection of Broadway and West End Avenue in the Upper West Side was depicted as being several blocks away from its true location. A special-edition map was released in 2004 to mark the restoration of service on the Manhattan Bridge following the conclusion of the Manhattan Bridge subway closures, which had required construction on the bridge's subway tracks for 18 years. The latest major revision to the official subway map, which took effect on June 27, 2010, makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller.New Subway Map is Here MTA.info website. Retrieved June 18, 2010. Several smaller streets were also removed. A late night-only version of the map was introduced on January 30, 2012. Current map The current official map of the subway system, based on the Tauranac redesign, incorporates a complex cartography to explain the subway's nomenclature. Different services that share a \\"trunk line\\" were assigned the same color; the trunk lines comprised all of the main lines within lower and midtown Manhattan, as well as the IND Crosstown Line, a trunk line that does not go into Manhattan. Express services were denoted with a separate stroke that bypassed all of the local stops. Transfers between stations were denoted by a thinner black stroke. The official map is not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system. For example, since Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn contain high densities of subway stations, these areas are shown as larger than they actually are. Likewise, Staten Island is shown in an inset because it does not have any subway stations, only the Staten Island Railway. Nevertheless, the map is known to help tourists navigate the city, as major city streets are shown alongside the subway stations serving them. The New York City Subway map is an anomaly among subway maps around the world, in that it shows city streets, parks, and neighborhoods juxtaposed among curved subway lines, whereas other subway maps (like the London Underground map) do not show such aboveground features and show subway lines as straight and at 45- or 90-degree angles. However, only ten buildings are actually shown on the map: four are in Staten Island, while a fifth is the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn. The current map, significantly changed from Tauranac's original redesign, uses over 20 font styles. =Spinoffs= There are several privately produced schematics that are available either online or in published form‚Äîsuch as KickMap, a hybrid diagram subway map that shows each route on its own line segments plus New York's parks, streets and neighborhoods; and Bullet Map, a map that shows bus and rail connections in more complexity. Additionally, the New York City Subway map has served as the subject of artistic endeavors. Among these are works by Fadeout Design and by Alexander Chen.TRANSPORTNATION  New York City. Retrieved August 26, 2011.Artist Turns New York Subway Map Into a Musical Instrument. Retrieved August 26, 2011. In the past, companies such as Hagstrom Map had also published New York City Subway maps. There are other subway map spinoffs as well, such as New York City Subway track schematics.New York City TrackbookNYC Subway Track Maps In 2014 an augmented reality subway map was made available for the subway. Additionally, \\"On The Go! Travel Stations\\" are electronic maps located in stations that make use of touchscreen technology to help subway patrons plan trips. Google Maps and Apple Maps also give transit directions, with the locations of stations laid over an actual street grid. Such maps have been increasingly prevalent. =Special maps= The Weekender In 2011, the MTA began to look at ways of displaying service disruptions due to weekend engineering works in a visual format. They invited Vignelli Associates (comprising at that time Massimo Vignelli, Yoshiki Waterhouse, and Beatriz Cifuentes) to develop a digital version of the 2008 map. On September 16, 2011, the MTA introduced a Vignelli Associates interactive subway map, called \\"The Weekender\\", to its website. As the title suggests, it is a way for riders to get information about any planned work, from late Friday night to early Monday morning, that is going on either on a service(s) or station(s) of the subway during the weekend only. On June 11, 2012, the MTA duplicated \\"The Weekender\\" site as a free mobile app download for iOS. On November 29, 2012, an Android version of the app was released. The Weekender, however, is only available as an online version, because it changes every week. The map design was inspired by Massimo Vignelli's 1972 subway map.http://web.mta.info/nyct/110Anniversary/subwayMaps.htm Night service map A night-service map, created by Charles Gordanier of the MTA, was first released in January 2012. The maps come in printed versions or as an online PDF file. Formerly, the maps were only available online or at certain stations, but , the maps started to be issued at all stations in the New York City Subway and Staten Island Railway systems. Regional Transit Diagram A special transit map was designed by Yoshiki Waterhouse at Vignelli Associates for Super Bowl XLVIII, the \\"Mass Transit Super Bowl\\". The game was played on February 2, 2014, at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It was the first Super Bowl played outdoors in a cold-weather city. Called the \\"Regional Transit Diagram\\", the map was initially produced specifically for Super Bowl XLVIII, and according to the MTA, \\"shows all inter-connections between the regional transit services, and highlights with a football icon those areas where Super Bowl related events will occur on both sides of the Hudson River. The diagram will appear on all transit provider websites, as well as on Super Bowl websites, guides, publications, mobile apps, and folding pocket maps.\\" Since private cars were not allowed to park at the stadium, the use of public transportation had correspondingly been increased. With 400,000 visitors expected to the area and 80,000 attendees expected at the game itself, the MTA decided to work with New Jersey Transit (NJT), Amtrak, and NY Waterway to produce a special-purpose Regional Transit Map and create the Mass Transit Super Bowl plan. The map is based on a New York City Subway map originally designed by Vignelli in 1972. The map shows all the commuter rail, subway, PATH, and light rail operations in urban northeastern New Jersey and Midtown and Lower Manhattan highlighting Super Bowl Boulevard, Prudential Center, MetLife Stadium and Jersey City. The map brought in several innovations: * The transit map showed both New York and New Jersey, and was the first time that an MTA-produced subway map had done that. * Besides showing the New York City Subway, the map also includes the MTA's Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit lines, and Amtrak lines in the consistent visual language of the Vignelli map. * For the first time since 1979, the MTA issued a Vignelli map on paper. * For the first time, a Vignelli map added in topographic features, such as the MetLife Stadium, the Prudential Center, and the Super Bowl Boulevard. , the diagram is still updated online and remains accessible on the MTA's website.  Real-time map  In October 2020, the MTA launched a beta version of a digital map showing real-time service patterns and service changes, designed by Work & Co. The real-time map uses a variation of the Vignelli map, with each route being depicted on its own band rather than being grouped by their trunk color. For instance, the 4, 5, and 6 trains would be shown as three bands, despite sharing the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, which would be depicted as a single band on the Tauranac/Hertz map. The real-time map also uses geographical landmarks, as the Tauranac/Hertz map does. In the beta version of the map, the bands were not necessarily correlated to their real-life locations. On the real-time map, the MTA uses its existing data feeds to show the locations of trains, depicted by darker bars moving along each respective subway route. Clicking on a station would also give information on the status of escalators and elevators in a station. Unlike similar apps, the real-time map does not use the Google Maps platform. Manhattan's street grid is oriented 29 degrees from true north, and the real- time map uses an orientation that follows Manhattan's street grid rather than the cardinal directions. However, the mobile version of Google Maps would not allow map rotation. =Imitation and parody maps= In September 2015, a map detailing the number of calories burnt walking between adjacent subway stops was developed by Treated.com and featured on the websites of Gothamist and Time Out. A \\"beer map\\" was created to show the best bars that are close to each station. The website Thrillist also created a \\"judgmental map\\" of each station in Manhattan. In May 2017, Brooklyn resident Andrew Lynch created a geographically accurate map of the system's tracks, which was featured on Gothamist. Color coding for subway routes =History of color coding= A map from the early 1990s. From 1904 to 1967, subway routes on the official subway map were drawn either in a single color or in three colors, which corresponded to the company that the route operated on ‚Äî the IRT, BMT, or IND.\\"Rapid Transit Map of Greater New York\\", a 1939 map of the subway, created before the companies were unified in 1940 Still, after the 1940 unification of the three companies' routes under the umbrella of a Board of Transportation‚Äîlater the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA)‚Äîthe three networks continued to operate separately and were generally referred to by their old names.\\"Rapid Transit Lines of the New York City Transit System\\", a 1948 map of the subway Both maps and the station signage continued to refer to the historical IRT, BMT, and IND. In 1964, a major review of wayfinding was triggered by the combination of two things: the large influx of visitors for the 1964 New York World's Fair, which made the subway and bus maps confusing to some visitors; and the connection of the BMT and IND networks through the 60th Street Tunnel Connection and the soon-to-be-opened Chrystie Street Connection, which rendered the three-color scheme unworkable. In 1964, the NYCTA launched the Subway Map Competition to get public input on redesigning the subway map, and in 1966 it engaged Unimark International to advise on signage and on the results of the Subway Map Competition. The winners of the competition were R. Raleigh D‚ÄôAdamo,Polytechnic University Cable 34:2 Winter 2007 p.7 Harris Schechtman, and Mary & John Condon.\\"3 Win Transit Authority Prizes For Designs of Subway Maps\\", New York Times, October 17, 1964 The TA forwarded D‚ÄôAdamo's reportMemorandum of Explanation by R.

To coordinate with the new color scheme in the map, the NYCTA began to roll out new station and car signage based on a design by Vignelli and Robert Noorda of Unimark International, using the route markers derived from those specified in D‚ÄôAdamo's report. The biggest innovation in this redevelopment of the map was the introduction of color-coding by subway route, which D‚ÄôAdamo recommended in his report to replace the outdated three-color scheme. After some experimentation, D‚ÄôAdamo found a set of colors for subway lines that avoided clashes; Goldstein used D‚ÄôAdamo's concept but invented his own color allocation; and finally Dante Calise at Diamond Packaging devised the color assignment that was used in the published map of 1967. Those colors were inherited by Unimark International and used in the famous 1972 Vignelli map.New York City Subway map, 1972, based on Vignelli's design That color scheme was rearranged by Tauranac in 1979 to create a trunk-colored map. =Current service colors= The colors used to denote services in the current iteration of the subway map are as follows: Table showing when each service label and color was used This is a table of when each service has existed (and been signed for the public). Shuttles were SS until 1985, when they became S (which had been used for specials). See here for the colors used for shuttles in 1967; in 1968 all six became green, and in 1979 all shuttles became dark gray. The maps were adjusted according to the service letters, numbers, and colors used at the time. Before the 1960s, service colors were disregarded, as maps usually showed all subway routes of one company in the same color, using only three colors for the lines of the three companies.

Biography =Early years= Assen Raztsvetnikov was born in a family that owned a substantial estate in the countryside. His father was a teacher. His mother was of a fine voice and was renowned for her performances of folklore songs that she learned from the grandfather of young Raztsvetnikov, Peter who was a fiddler. Raztsvetnikov graduated from the Veliko Turnovo high school in 1916. He then went on to work at the Veliko Turnovo communication center and later on at the postal telegraph service at Gorna Oryahovitsa station. He studied Slavic philology at Sofia University (1920), and after obtaining his degree travelled to attend lectures in aesthetics in Vienna and Berlin (1921‚Äì1922). Finally, he received a law degree from Sofia University in 1926. =Teaching Career and education= Raztsvetnikov taught in Gabrovo (1926‚Äì1929). In the period 1930‚Äì1934, he moved to teach Bulgarian language in a gymnasium in Sofia, where he also took lead as a librarian. In 1934 he became librarian in the Postal services. After 1934, Raztsvetnikov dedicated himself to literature: he actively collaborated with literary magazines \\"Nov Put\\" and \\"Zlatorog\\".–¶–î–ê, –§. 142–ö ‚Äî –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∞ –∑–∞ –ê—Å–µ–Ω –†–∞–∑—Ü–≤–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ After the end of World War II and the establishment of the new Communist regime on 9 September 1944, Raztsvetnikov was recruited as a translator at the Institute of Literary Translation in the Ministry of Communication. Literary Career and Legacy Assen Raztsvetnikov began trying his hand at verse compositions when he was still a student in high school. His first publication appeared in the magazine \\"Bulgarian\\" under the penname Anri. Throughout his collaboration with leftist writers and magazine editors of the period, he became one of the most distinguish representative of the \\"September Four\\" along with Angel Karaliichev, Nikola Furnadzhiev, and Georgi Tsanev. His involvement and ideas during the period lied at the core of his first collection of poems, \\"Jertveni kladi\\" (1924). A turning point in Raztsvetnikov's literary life and career came in 1924 when he participated in a memorial reading that marked ten years from the death of poet Peyo Yavorov in the Sofia university. Raztsvetnikov, Angel Karaliichev, Nikola Furnadzhiev and Georgi Tsanev were convicted by fellow BCP members in cultivating social bourgeois mentality. Under the hail of accusations, Razcvetnikov gradually distanced himself from the leftist jargon and ideology, ended his collaboration with the major leftist magazine \\"Nov Put\\" and joined instead magazine \\"Zlatorog\\" edited by Vladimir Vassilev. In the thirties, Raztsvetnikov concentrated his literary energy into creating poetry for children, thus, leaving behind a panoply of books with riddles, verses, and tales that has nourished generations of young readers ever after. As to his second major occupation, he translated classical works from German, among which his most important contribution was the translation of Ode to Joy by Friedrich Schiller.

Van Dyke. The film stars Tom Stern, Jeremy Slate, Conny Van Dyke, and Steve Sandor. Plot Two rich brothers want to rob a Las Vegas casino, just for the fun and thrill. They decide to use the Oakland Hells Angels as dupes in their plans by pretending to be members of an East Coast motorcycle club/gang and winning the Angels' trust, and then using them to create a disturbance outside the casino while they are inside robbing it. Everything goes as planned‚Äîthe brothers even manipulate the Angels into telling them to go away‚Äîbut then a small mistake results in the Angels figuring out that they've been used‚Äîand nobody makes fools of the Hells Angels. It turns out the two brothers are step-brothers, and that only one of them inherited money. The other lives off his brother's generosity and doesn't like being beholden. Rich brother planned all along to return the money once they made their get-away and \\"got away with\\" the robbery. Poor brother thought they were doing it for real and that half of the take would be his to keep. The movie is noteworthy is having prominent members of the Hells Angels play themselves. Cast * Tom Stern as Chuck * Jeremy Slate as Wes * Conny Van Dyke as Betsy * Steve Sandor as Apache * Sonny Barger as Sonny * Clifford Workman as Skip * Tiny Walters as Tiny * Charles Tinsley as Charlie Magoo * John Terence Tracy as Terry The Tramp aka Tramp * The Oakland Hells Angels as Themselves * G.D. Spradlin as Detective Release Hell's Angels '69 was released in theatres on July 15, 1970. The film was released on DVD on July 27, 2004 and again on January 31, 2006. Reception =Critical response= Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote in his review: \\"HELL'S ANGELS '69, which opened about 30 per cent out of focus at the DeMille yesterday, uses that noted law-and-order group, the Oakland Hells Angels, as heroes in a dismal story that wastes most of its attention on the villains. By now their physical resemblance to lovable teddy bears may well have affected the Angels' self image, but not, I hope, to the extent that they continue to submit to such degrading elevation in American folk-demonology. Two California playboy types (Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate, who also wrote the film in which they star) join the Angels and con them into riding to Las Vegas, where they use them as public diversion to cover a robbery from Caesars Palace. \\"They make their haul, and their getaway, but not without the encumbrance of a buxom Angel mamma (Conny Van Dyke) and the threat of the Angels' revenge. Revenge comes after a desert motorcycle chase, photographed with such concern for getting pursuers and pursued into a single frame that it looks less like a chase than a pleasure ride. Before the Angels have brutally righted the wrong, the Nevada desert has been covered with a quantity of lost loot perhaps unequaled since the windblown paper money finale of Allan Dwan's The River's Edge (1957). But comparisons can only hurt Hell's Angels '69, which more than lacks in character and conviction what it attempts to make up in sucker's-eye views of Vegas casinos and timid glances at bike-groups' mores. With this caper, as with so many in recent movies, the theft is for a lark rather than for the money ‚Äî a squandering of time and energy (more time than energy) that seems both unesthetic and immoral. Only Miss Van Dyke emerges, her acting ability still in question (a plus in the context of Hell's Angels '69), but her physical presence superb. Plump, pretty, with a kind of facial nobility that depends more on soul than on bone structure, she catches the image of the American lost girl with an indirection that deserves a better movie than this.

It is Thom's sole directorial credit. Thom had previously written Wild in the Streets for American International Pictures, which distributed this follow-up. The film was made for Sam Katzman's Four Leaf Productions. Thom based his screenplay on an unproduced stage play of the same title which he wrote c.1960 as a vehicle for his wife, actress Janice Rule. Premise The overweight, emotionally troubled daughter (Holly Near) of an affluent but brittle Hollywood couple (Jennifer Jones and Charles Aidman) gets caught up with a charismatic rock singer (Jordan Christopher) and his friends. The singer proceeds to seduce and manipulate her entire family. Cast *Jennifer Jones as Astrid Steele *Jordan Christopher as Bogart Peter Stuyvesant *Holly Near as Tara Steele *Lou Rawls as Joe *Charles Aidman as Willy Steele *Davey Davison as Anna Livia *Roddy McDowall as Santoro Production In August 1960 Thom, best known for writing the film Compulsion, announced he would direct a play Angel Angel Down We Go starring this then wife Janice Rule. It would be presented by Leland Hayward in December and was about a group of New York University students in Greenwich Village. By November Hawyward said production was not going ahead because he had been unable to find a director and a theatre. In August 1961 the play was acquired by a company, Theatrical Interests Plan. In September 1962 Shirley Knight was going to star. The Broadway production did not occur and Thom turned it into a film script. Film rights were bought by Sam Katzman who sourced finance from AIP. Jones signed in December 1968 and filming began 18 February 1969. Jordan Christopher, married to Richard Burton's ex-wife Sybil, signed to co star. The part of the daughter was played by Holly Near who had not planned to be in movies but had been invited to audition off the back of her appearance at the Hugh O'Brian awards. \\"I got the part because I was beautiful and because I was fat\\", recalled Near in her memoir, adding that Thom asked her to put on a few pounds for the movie.Near p 43 Near said Jones \\"was the grand dame that she deserved to be. I watched her struggle with her part, with her role, with her fear. I felt like an ugly ducking next to an aging swan.\\"Near p 44 Near wrote that she felt Thom \\"didn't have much compassion for my character... I struggled to give her dignity where there was none... I always wondered why Robert wanted to make this film.\\" Songs The songs in the film - \\"Angel Angel Down We Go\\", \\"The Fat Song\\", \\"Hey Hey Hey and a Hi Ho\\", \\"Lady Lady\\", \\"Mother Lover\\" and \\"Revelation\\" - were written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, and were sung by Jordan Christopher. Reception The Los Angeles Times called it \\"a pretentious mess\\" although \\"it can never be said to bore.\\" According to the New York Times the film was \\"an unmitigated financial disaster.\\" \\"It was trash\\", said Near.Near p 46 AIP tried re- releasing the film as The Cult of the Damned in 1970. It was issued on a double bill with The Vampire Lovers.

Built in 1855 and repeatedly enlarged, it is one of only two surviving 19th-century railroad hotels in the town. It was operated until 1960, and for many years housed the local VFW post. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It is now home to the Greater Wakefield Resource Center. Description and history The Union Hotel is located in southernmost Wakefield, in the village of Union at the northwest corner of Main and Church streets. It is essentially a complex of connected wood-frame structures, most 2-1/2 stories in height and covered in wooden clapboards. It consists of a main block and several wings, which primarily housed hotel rooms, arranged around a central courtyard and connected by covered passages. An open single-story porch extends across the front and around to both sides, with a hip roof supported by round metal posts. The interior of the public spaces have a mix of old and modern finishes, from original marble parquet flooring to linoleum. The 2-1/2 story wood frame building was built in 1855 by Robert Pike, who operated the hotel until his death in 1916. It was then operated by other owners until financial reverses led to a bank foreclosure in 1961. The local VFW post purchased the building in 1966. Most recently, the building has been acquired and restored by the Greater Wakefield Resource Center, a non-profit umbrella organization. The building is one of only three hotel buildings that were purpose-built after the arrival of the railroad in the area, at a time when the Union village in southern Wakefield was its northern terminus. For seventeen years, Union had the only railroad station in all of Carroll County, making it a key transportation junction for the region.

Starring Lino Ventura, Bernard Blier and Mireille Darc, with witty dialogue by Michel Audiard, it is an espionage caper built around the efforts of agents from various countries to extract valuable weaponry patents from the young and attractive widow of an international arms dealer. Plot In Paris, French counter-espionage are alerted to the death in an expensive brothel of international arms dealer Shah. To avoid repercussions and to exploit this opportunity, they smuggle his corpse back to his castle in Bavaria in the care of top agent Francis, posing as the dead man's cousin Ludo. There he hands it over to the young and very attractive French widow Amaranth, who is now the legal owner of the valuable patents for nuclear weaponry that Shah had acquired. The fake cousin Ludo's mission is to get the patents for France, but he is joined at the castle by a fake Russian step-brother Boris, a fake German psychoanalyst Hans and a fake Italian priest Eusebio. After trying unsuccessfully to eliminate each other by such devices as a bomb in the bathroom cistern and a scorpion in the bed, the four agents agree an uneasy truce and instead concentrate on charming the widow. While she is in no hurry to decide the future of her person or her patents, the shaky alliance of the spies faces two new challenges. One is O'Brien, a brash American who regularly bursts in and is regularly thrown out into the moat by the temporary allies. The other is gradual and subtle, in the form of Chinese spies who infiltrate the castle by killing the servants one by one and assuming their clothes and jobs. Following a climactic battle in which the hordes of Chinese using martial arts are eliminated, Francis is admitted to the widow's bed and in the morning escapes with her to Lisbon, where the patents are in a bank vault. She, regarding the trip as an advance honeymoon with her next husband, agrees to return to France with him and the patents. But the three foiled spies and O'Brien have not given up, leading to further battles which demolish part of the Portuguese hotel and result in bodies dropping regularly from the night express to Paris. In the end, as a patriotic act to secure the patents for France, Francis commits bigamy by marrying Amaranth.

The 2-1/2 story wood frame house is believed to have been built c. 1785, but its exterior styling is mainly Federal in character, dating to the 1820s or later. It was used as an inn on the busy stagecoach route through town in the 19th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Wakefield House is located in the central village of Wakefield Corner, on the east side of the triangular junction of New Hampshire Route 153 and Wakefield Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, end chimneys, and clapboarded exterior. It has a five-bay facade, with a double center door that is a mid-19th century alteration, probably made when the building was converted for use as an inn in 1853. The single-story front porch, which extends the full width of the facade, also dates to this time. The property also includes a barn, carriage barn, and toolshed. The village of Wakefield Corner is one of the older villages of the town, having become well established by 1800 as a center of commerce and transportation. It was home to the town offices, shops, and taverns and inns serving the stagecoach route. The village was bypassed by the railroad, which stopped at Sanbornville, a mile to the north, but has retained some of its civic importance. The Wakefield House, constructed in the late 19th century as a private residence, was converted into an inn in 1853 to serve this business. It continued in this use into the 1879s, and remains a well-preserved example of a mid-19th century traveler accommodation.

Joo Won received nominations for Best New Actor at the 48th Baeksang Arts Awards and the 21st Buil Film Awards in 2012. Plot Seong-beom is a foul-mouthed, hot- tempered detective with uncanny animal instincts in the violent crimes section who has never failed to solve a case. While he is on an undercover operation, he hears that a colleague of his has been brutally murdered by an unknown assailant. Seong-beom and the police agency instinctively know there is something behind this murder case. They set up a Special Investigations Unit (S.I.U.), and profiler Ho-ryong, a former FBI agent, is assigned as Seong- beom's partner. As the police dragnet begins to close in, the suspect is always faster than the police.

Chicken sexing is practiced mostly by large commercial hatcheries to separate female chicks or \\"pullets\\" (destined to lay eggs for commercial sale) from the males or \\"cockerels\\" (most of which are killed within days of hatching because they are irrelevant to egg production). The females and a limited number of males kept for meat production are then put on different feeding programs appropriate for their commercial roles. Different segments of the poultry industry sex chickens for various reasons. In farms that produce eggs, males are unwanted; for meat production, separate male and female lines for breeding are maintained to produce the hybrid birds that are sold for the table, and chicks of the wrong sex in either line are unwanted. Chicks of an unwanted sex are killed almost immediately to reduce costs to the breeder.Hatchery Horrors: The Egg Industry's tiniest victims. Mercy for Animals.New Investigation Reveals Horrific Cruelty at 'Humane' Chicken Hatchery . Mercy for Animals. Retrieved 17 October 2013. Methods of chick sexing Several methods are used to determine the sex of a day-old chick. Some are effective only with certain breeds or crosses, while others are universal. The two chief methods of sexing chicks are feather sexing and vent sexing. =Vent sexing= Vent sexing in Wenchang, Hainan, China (2014) Vent sexing, also known simply as venting, involves squeezing the feces out of the chick, which opens up the chick's anal vent (called a cloaca) slightly, allowing the chicken sexer to see if the chick has a small \\"bump\\", which would indicate that the chick is a male. Some females also have bumps, though they are rarely as large as those of male chicks. The eminence or genital organ is found midway on the lower rim of the vent, and looks like a very small pimple. Most males have a relatively prominent eminence, most females have none. However, a small proportion of both males and female have relatively small eminences. Sexing these chickens can be quite difficult, but with regular practice, the sexer will eventually learn to identify the differences. When learning to sex chickens, it is best to assume that chickens with small eminences are female. The male eminence is solid and will not disappear upon gentle rubbing with one's thumb. A paper about vent sexing was published in Japan in 1933 by Professors Masui and Hashimoto, which was soon translated into English under the title sexing baby chicks. After their discovery, interested poultry breeders hired those who had been trained in Masui and Hashimoto's technique, or sent representatives to Japan to learn it. = Feather sexing = Chicks of different sexes can appear quite similar. (See also Delayed feathering in chickens for a description of the genes involved.) The sex-linked slow-feathering gene can be used for crosses where the sex of the chicks can be determined at hatching time by the length of the wing feathers. A cross between a fast-feathering male and a slow-feathering female results in offspring where the female chicks have primary wing feathers that are significantly longer than the coverts. The male chicks have primary wing feathers that are shorter, about the same length as the coverts. = Colour sexing = The sex-linked silver/gold (Ss) gene can also be used to sex newly hatched chicks. An S female mated to an s male will produce offspring where the females have a darker, buff down color, while the males have a lighter, whiter down colour. If not obscured by other coloration (controlled by other genes), the chicks can accurately be sexed with little or no training. = Auto-sexing breeds = With some breeds, the sex of the newly hatched chick can be discovered by inspection without resorting to the use of sex-linked crosses in the parent stock. One example of an auto-sexing breed is the California Gray, developed by Dryden Farms in the 1950s. =Semi-auto-sexing breeds= Newly hatched Barred Rocks, Rhode Island Reds, and New Hampshire Reds can be sexed with fair accuracy. With Barred Rocks, the males tend to have a large, distinct white head spot and yellow feet, and the females have a smaller, less well-defined head spot and darker feet. Rhode Island Red and New Hampshire Red chicks with chipmunk stripes are almost always females. With all these breeds, the chicks with the most distinct indicators can be sexed with confidence, while the others cannot. Nevertheless, one can often pick over a straight-run batch of chicks (at a feed store, say) and find enough of the desired sex. =Alternative methods= Small poultry farmers whose operations are not of sufficient size to warrant hiring a chicken sexer must wait until the hatchlings are four to six weeks old before learning the sexes of their chickens. At that time, their secondary sex characteristics begin to appear, making it possible for anyone with a minimal amount of training to sex a chicken. =In-ovo sexing= Automated systems to determine the sex of the developing chick long before hatching have been announced but not widely deployed . A 97% accurate 14-day in-ovo experiment was reported in 2017. The system relies on candling eggs and using spectroscopy to determine feather colour, and hence is suitable only for strains with sex-linked feather colouration. =Machine sexing= Chicken sexing machine used in sexing poultry - baby chickens Instrument or machine sexing of chickens has almost disappeared, because the instruments are no longer available and spare parts cannot be obtained. The Keeler Optical (English) or Chicktester (Japanese) machine features a blunt-ended telescopic tube, containing a light. The sexer inserts the tube into the evacuated cloaca and with the help of the light can identify either testis or ovaries. Successful development of this technique depends on the capability of the students and their level of experience. Cultural references * Chick sexing was an important mode of employment for second-generation Japanese Americans (Nisei), who dominated the trade between the late 1930s and 1950s. * The 'example of the chicken sexers' is famous in several debates in philosophy, especially in the internalism/externalism debate in epistemology. As the chick sexer does not ‚Äúexperience the chicken as being male or female,‚Äù the exact nature of the source of their knowledge becomes a matter of discussion to explore the relationship between experience, perception, and inference.

He is known for his arrangements of pop songs by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and the Beatles and for the use of beatboxing while playing guitar. Career =Early life= Rafferty was born January 26, 1969, and raised in Harlem, New York. His first inspiration was his father strumming a Martin D-28 guitar for him. By the age of six, he was studying with Woody Mann and exploring blues and country music. He credits Woody Mann with much of his development. A few years later, Rafferty was introduced to classical guitar with formal instruction from Dennis Cinelli and Pat O'Brien. In 1986, he enrolled at the State University of New York at Purchase, majoring in classical guitar. He continued a fruitful collaboration with childhood friend and drummer, John- Christian Urich. They played together in a variety of contexts from hard rock to R&B.; By the time Rafferty finished college, he switched to electric guitar. =Rap and jazz= By the mid to late 1980s, Rafferty and Urich formed the duo Raf and Cooly C, backed by a live band, with Rafferty rapping and playing guitar and Urich adding drums and beatbox. The duo created a local stir. They were picked to perform on the album, Bring Me Edelweiss by the Austrian band Edelweiss for Atlantic Records. The album went gold in Europe, though Rafferty and Urich never made any money. In 1989, Rafferty quit Raf and Cooly C and began to explore jazz. After seeing pianist Mike Longo perform at the Birdland club in New York, he took lessons from him. After graduating from college, he played in jam sessions and gigs in New York City. He worked with Bob Cranshaw, Lou Donaldson, Virgil Jones, Gloria Lynn, Frank Wess, Buster Williams, and the Dizzy Gillespie Big Band directed by Jimmy Owens. He also crossed paths with talents from his own generation, such as Eric Person, Norah Jones, and Chris Potter. Drawn to the jazz scene in Harlem, he worked for nearly a year with organist Jimmy \\"Preacher\\" Robbins. He also worked with the Tippy Larkin Quintet. In 1993, he recorded his debut album, First Impressions, with his mentor, Mike Longo, on piano, Paul West on bass, and Ray Mosca on drums. The album received a favorable review in Just Jazz Guitar magazine. Beginning in the mid 1990s, he headed his own trio, often taking them on annual tours of Europe, particularly in Austria and Germany. By the late '90s, he settled on a band featuring Danton Boller and Tomas Fujiwara. The same group appeared on his third album, Three Souls. He formed an experimental jazz trio, the New York Trio Project, with bassist John Menegon and drummer Jeff Siegel. Boller introduced him to tenor saxophonist Bennie Wallace, and tours followed. He met Alvin Queen, who used him as a sideman in his quintet with alto saxophonist Jesse Davis and trumpeter Joe Magnarelli. In 2006, he was asked to substitute on Lonnie Smith's organ trio. They performed at jazz festivals, the Jazz Standard, and Smoke in New York City. =Switching to fingerstyle= In 2007, a friend showed him a video of fingerstyle guitarist Tommy Emmanuel. Inspired by what he saw, he began to experiment with arranging pop songs, taking an approach that enabled him to play bass lines, melody, and middle voicings simultaneously. He brought to fingerstyle guitar the music he enjoyed kid: disco, hip hop, funk, jazz, and R&B.; He also used beatboxing, which he learned from Run‚ÄìD.M.C. records in the 1980s and from his time as a rapper. His first album as a solo acoustic guitarist, Gratitude, was recorded on his own at his home in Jackson Heights, New York. He began distributing his home performances on YouTube. His cover versions of Michael Jackson's \\"Billie Jean\\" and Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\" received more than one million views. At the suggestion of a YouTube fan, Rafferty went to the Chet Atkins Appreciation Society in 2008 to meet like-minded fingerstyle guitarists. He was asked to be appear as a guest at a Tommy Emmanuel concert at B.B. King's club in New York. He performed with Emmanuel at the Bangkok Guitar Festival, in Helsinki, Finland in 2009, and again B.B. King's club in 2010. The association with Emmanuel allowed him to meet and play with other established acoustic musicians, such as Michael Fix and Joe Robinson. Other work He performed at Merkin Concert Hall in New York City in 1996 at a tribute concert for guitarist Tal Farlow. Included on the bill were over a dozen jazz guitarists, including Jimmy Bruno, Howard Alden, Jack Wilkins, Johnny Smith, Remo Palmier, John Abercrombie, Herb Ellis, Ron Affif, Al Gafa, Joe Diorio, Mark Elf, Gene Bertoncini, and Vic Juris. He has written two instructional books, How to Develop Virtuoso Single Line Technique for Jazz Guitar, based on ‚ÄúThe Virtuoso Pianist‚Äù by C.F. Hanon (2003) and How to Play Single Note Lines that Outline Chord Changes for Jazz Guitar (2003). Award and honors In 1998, he was selected for inclusion in the book, The Jazz Guitar: Its Evolution, Player, and Personalities Since 1900 by Maurice J. Summerfield. His album I Remember Michael was in the top 10 Critics' Poll of Jazziz magazine in 2011.

However, the Arctic Ocean remains relatively clean compared to other marine regions of the world. Economic activity in the Arctic seas is not the only source of pollution. The growing presence of military weapons systems in the region raises concerns of increased pollution. Management of specific risks of marine pollution in the Arctic is governed primarily by national legislation in coastal states, although these take existing international standards into account. Bilateral agreements exist between Arctic states on cooperation in the prevention of marine pollution in the Arctic seas and immediate responses in case of oil spills. Nevertheless, there is no legal framework relating to weapons and other military presence. The first steps in this direction have already been made. After signing the 2010 Treaty on Maritime Delimitation of the continental shelf in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean, Russia and Norway began bilateral consultations on the harmonization of national environmental standards used for the exploration and development of the mineral resources of the shelf. The parties came to an agreement to make a comparative analysis of national legislation and to identify differences concerning measures for preventing the pollution of the environment. A recent report published by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) suggested that the reduction of the polar ice caps and the projected increase in shipping activity in the region could have a severe impact on the levels of pollution experienced across the entire Arctic region but notes that a shift to cleaner sulphur-based fuel could resolve the issue.

It is situated at the southern flank of the Verne Ramparts, on the slopes of Verne Hill, along the route of the horse drawn and cable operated Merchant's Railway - now a public footpath. It is on the edge of the Verne Citadel, a 19th-century fort, which is now HM Prison The Verne. The cistern became Grade II Listed in May 1993. History Constructed circa 1880, the water supply cistern has a monumental entrance built into the hillside. This cistern evidently served, inter alia, a tank slightly lower on the slope, however this is now concealed by foliage and remains inaccessible. At the time of construction of the citadel, the southern face of Verne Hill went through remodeling, and this was when an existing fresh water spring head was housed in the cistern's stone retaining wall, cut into the outer wall of the Verne Ditch bank, midway along and adjacent to the upper track. Before the supply of piped water to Portland in the early 20th century, this storage cistern and its works would have been an important installation. In recent decades the entrance of the cistern has become overgrown and inaccessible, but is often cut back and cleared. The structure is not under care, and remains a victim of vandalism, particularly littering within the interior. It is located on common land, and can be viewed by the public.

The unusual windy weather conditions also contributed to two other fires on the same day in Sweden. Ume√• took the opportunity to complete its plans to restructure the city. Part of the new design included planting of birch trees along the streets, leading to Ume√• being known as the \\"City of Birches\\". History The preponderance of fires around the city increased as agriculture methods changed. Historically the S√°mi people had not used burning as a part of their practice, as it destroyed the lichen required by their reindeer. However, new farmers frequently used swidden or slash and burn farming. During the nineteenth century, the timber industry moved north, clearing the land of trees but leaving the waste behind and creating a fire risk. There was a fire in Norrland in 1851, and in the later 19th century fires swept the area every ten years or so: there were major fires in 1868 and in 1878, but the most damaging to Ume√• occurred on the afternoon of 25 June 1888. This fire was reported to have started at a brewery near Renmarksb√§cken. On the same day there was a devastating fire in Sundsvall driven by high wind. There were several other forest fires in Sweden that day, and the settlement of Lilla Edet near Gothenburg also burnt to the ground. In Ume√•, the town hall was destroyed as were the Teg shipyards and houses in the eastern parts of Ume√• and on √ñn Island. The fire left 2,300 of the 3,000 inhabitants without homes. After the fire The oldest fire station in the city dates from the year of the fire The fires at three unconnected Swedish settlements were widely reported. A collection made in California to aid the victims raised $5,000 and blankets and tents were sent from New Zealand to help the homeless. King Oscar and his ministers toured the area and collections were organised in all the major Swedish towns. Ume√• had drawn up improved urban plans when it became a government requirement in 1874 and had already started making changes to the city infrastructure. The town of Sundsvall was arguing for a reduction in the new insurance rules three years after its fire because it had decided to rebuild its buildings in stone. To prevent the spread of fire between wooden buildings, streets were designed to be wide enough to serve as firebreaks. The streets were lined with birch trees; as a result, Ume√• came to be known as the \\"Bj√∂rkarnas Stad\\", the \\"City of Birches\\". The Ume√• Town Hall was rebuilt on the original site to a design by Fredrik Olaus Lindstr√∂m. It was completed in 1890. Ume√• City Church also had to be rebuilt according to a design by Lindstrom, whilst the brick built old prison survived. The oldest fire station in the city is brick-built and dates from 1888.

The FAP began at Fresno State College, as a way to address gender inequities in art education, and the art world in general. In 1971, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro brought the FAP to the newly formed California Institute of the Arts, leaving Rita Yokoi to run the Fresno FAP until her retirement in 1992. The FAP at California Institute of the Arts was active until 1976. The students in the Feminist Art Program read women writers, studied women artists, and made art about being a woman based on group consciousness raising sessions. Often, the program was separate from the rest of the art school to allow the women to develop in a greenhouse-like environment and away from discerning critiques. While the separatist ideology has been critiqued as reinforcing gender, the FAP has made a lasting impression on feminist art which can be seen in retrospectives, group exhibitions, and creative re-workings of the original projects.  Fresno Feminist Art Program  The original Feminist Art Program was developed by artist Judy Chicago. The first such program was launched in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College, now California State University, Fresno. In the spring of 1971, It became a full 15-unit program. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Artist Vicki Hall worked as Judy Chicago's teaching assistant. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. The Fresno Feminist Art Program served as a model for other feminist art efforts, such as Womanhouse, a collaborative feminist art exhibition and the first project produced after the Feminist Art Program moved to the California Institute of the Arts in the fall of 1971. Sheila de Bretteville and Arlene Raven also taught in that program. Womanhouse, like the Fresno project, also developed into a feminist studio space and promoted the concept of collaborative women's art. After Chicago left for CalArts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992. Feminist Art Program (FAP) at CalArts Later, Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program (FAP) at California Institute of the Arts. The Feminist Art Program (FAP) was created by Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California, in 1971. Building on the \\"radical educational techniques\\" that she had first tried out in her classes for women in 19701971, when she worked at Fresno State, Chicago and Schapiro made the program, the first of its kind accessible to women only. Chicago in particular felt she had to \\"redo\\" her education as an art historian, since she had been taught by men exclusively and considered that this background forced a male perspective on her as an artist and disallowed her from developing her \\"own forms, artistic language, and subject matter\\". Feminist Studio Workshop The Feminist Studio Workshop was founded in Los Angeles in 1973 by Judy Chicago, Arlene Raven, and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville as a two-year feminist art program. Women from the program were instrumental in finding and creating the Woman's Building, the first independent center to showcase women's art and culture. Disillusioned with the male-dominated atmosphere at CalArts and desiring their own space, the faculty modeled their classes on a non-hierarchical structure and focused on training students in less traditional art forms such as performance art and graphic design. Chicago left the Feminist Studio Workshop in 1974 to work on The Dinner Party, and by the end of the decade, Raven and de Bretteville had left as well and the program was taken over by former students. However, enrollment in the Feminist Studio Workshop declined as the political climate changed and public funding decreased. The program closed in 1981, although the Woman's Building itself remained open until 1991.

Charles C. Foote (March 30, 1811 - May 3, 1891) was an American Presbyterian minister, abolitionist and temperance activist. He was the vice- presidential nominee of the Liberty Party in the 1848 election alongside Gerritt Smith. The Liberty Party was an abolitionist political party which later merged with the Free Soil Party. Foote was born in 1811 in Olean, New York and moved to Milford, Michigan in 1834. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1840. He was ordained a Presbyterian minister and married Clarissa Clark in that same year. He spent the next two years studying medicine at Fairfield Medical School with a desire for foreign missionary work. Instead of going abroad, Foote served as a pastor in churches in upstate New York and Michigan. In 1848, he was chosen as the Liberty Party's vice-presidential nominee on the 2nd ballot of their national convention. The ticket would come in fourth place in the election, carrying 2,545 popular votes, all from New York. In 1854, Foote moved to Detroit, Michigan and served as a traveling fundraising agent of the Refugee Home Society, which purchased land for former slaves in Ontario, where slavery was outlawed. He stayed in this position until the American Civil War ended and slavery was outlawed, at which time Foote became an agent in the Freedmen's Aid Society. In 1882, Foote ran for Governor of Michigan as the American Party nominee. The American Party was a political party which demanded recognition of the Sabbath, the introduction of the Bible into public schools, alcohol prohibition, the restriction of land monopolies and resumption of specie payment. He was also an active member of the Prohibition Party from its founding in 1869 until his death in 1891. Foote's first wife, Clarissa, died in 1857 and was buried in White Lake, Michigan. He married Hannah Merritt a year later. Foote died on May 3, 1891 at the age of 80 and was also buried in White Lake.

Biography He was born in Castel Durante as the son of Guido Durantino, who was also known as Guido Fontana. Along with his father and his brothers Camillo and Nicola, he ran a workshop for several decades. He finally moved with his family to Urbino from the 1530s onwards, where he set up his own workshop in grotesques in 1565. Supported by Duke Guidobaldo II of Urbino, Orazio introduced istoriato maiolica in the area, hence contributing to the development of new center of maiolica production and innovation. Later on he concentrated on luxury wares of the Spezieria (Medical Dispensary attached to the Palace at Urbino) with surprisingly sculptural, sometimes even fantastic shapes, leaving the plainer, and probably more profitable, white and common wares to his father. Together with his workshop he realized great commissions, including table service for Anne de Montmorency. He died in Urbino in 1571. The rinfrescatoi basin in the District Museum in Tarn√≥w created between 1565-1571, is one of the best examples of Orazio's workshop artistry combining grotesque sculpture, original form with colourful painted decoration.

The group reached the national pop charts with \\"I Learned A Lesson I'll Never Forget\\" in 1944, but Dickens soon left to join the Phil Moore Four as bass player, recording with them for the RCA label.

They recorded for the Continental, Super Disc and Gotham record labels over the next three years, releasing a string of jump blues singles but with little commercial success. In mid 1949 Dickens began recording for Decca Records. By that time, his group had become a Quintet, comprising Dickens himself on bass, Louis Judge (tenor sax), Clarence Harmon (piano), Sam Hendricks (guitar), and Jimmy Crawford (drums), with vocalist Joe Gregory. One of his recordings was \\"a slightly speeded up, slightly smoothed out adaptation\\" of Wild Bill Moore's earlier record, \\"Rock and Roll\\". Dickens also made recordings as an accompanist to boogie woogie blues musician Piano Red. Dickens and his Quintet continued to record for Decca until 1951, their recordings including \\"We're Gonna Rock This Morning\\" (1951). Dickens also undertook club performances as the leader of Doles Dickens and His Whispers; it is unclear whether the same musicians were in both groups. He maintained a career as a session musician in New York, appearing on records by Wilbert Harrison, Varetta Dillard, Jimmy Witherspoon, Piano Red, Mahalia Jackson, Bill Haley, LaVern Baker and others. His final recording under his own name was \\"Piakukaungcung\\", an instrumental on the Dot label in 1958, written by Lincoln Chase and described by Billboard as having \\"the sound of hysteria...

Production Little Jessie James was written by Harlan Thompson, the author of the book and the lyrics. The music was by Harry Archer. It was staged by Walter Brooks and produced by L. Lawrence Weber. Scenery was designed by P. Dodd Ackerman and costumes by Mabel E. Johnston. Nan Halperin played Jessie Jamieson, in pursuit of Jay Velie as Paul Revere. Supporting roles were played by Miriam Hopkins and Allen Kearns. This was Halperin's best known role outside of vaudeville. The show was low-cost, with a single set and only eight chorus girls. The James Boys, who were billed as the \\"Paul Whiteman Orchestra\\", played a specialty during the entr'acte. The musical director Ernest Cutting had eleven men in the pit at the Longacre. including strings, brass, piano and percussion. Halperin and Jay Velie introduced the song I Love You by Thompson and Archer. The musical played at the Longacre Theatre on Broadway from August 15, 1923 to January 27, 1924, then moved to the Little Theatre where it played until July 19, 1924. The show played for a total of 385 performances. After New York, L. Lawrence Weber took the show on the road with four touring companies in the USA. It played for one night in Schenectady, New York, on March 18, 1925. The show played in Australia for eight months, and under the name Lucky Break played in London for 198 performances in 1934‚Äì35. Plot synopsis Little Jessie James is a musical farce in two acts. Despite its name, it was not a western but was set in an apartment looking over Central Park. Jessie Jamieson (Halperin) is out to get Paul Revere (Velie) and will not let the usual bedroom farce complications distract her from winning her man. Reception The New York critics did not pan the show, but did not give it much attention. It only received passing mention from Burns Mantle in his review of the year's shows. However, Little Jessie James was the biggest hit of the season. I Love You contributed to the show's success. The song was the biggest hit of all the songs from that season's musicals.

He was born in Moravia, the son of Theodor Koerner, part of a family involved in the lumber industry. Koerner was exposed to art at an early age in Paris and Italy. Although his ultimate goal was to become an artist, on his father's advice, he studied law at Charles University in Prague and at the Sorbonne. With the rise of the Third Reich in Germany, he left Prague with his father and uncles, settling in Paris. However, it became necessary for the family to leave again and, the following year, they arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia. He worked in the family lumber business for twelve years before returning to his first love, art. He also taught at the Vancouver School of Art and the University of British Columbia. A number of his works were acquired by the National Gallery of Canada. He also became friends with painter Lawren Harris, who invited him to join the exhibition committee of the Vancouver Art Gallery. His work also appears in the collections of the Tate in London, of Clare Hall at Cambridge University and of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC. His work was influenced by German philosopher Bo Yin Ra. Following his 100th birthday, Koerner had a show at the Burnaby Art Gallery and the exhibition John Koerner: The Hidden Side of Nature at the Penticton Art Gallery. He died at home in Vancouver at the age of 100. He was married twice: first to Eileen Newby, who died in 2001, and then to Lisa Birnie.

He is best known for his early work at LinkedIn, for being a co-founder of PeopleLinx, and for being a founder of UpdatesCentral. Biography Born in Wausau, Wisconsin, his father became a colonel in the US Army, resulting in the family moving around the United States, including to Chicago and later Atlanta, Georgia. After graduating from Alfred University with a BSBA in Marketing, he studied at Bond University on Australia's Gold Coast. Baynes serves as advisor to several start-ups and consults with senior executives on business architecture and internet product strategy. Baynes is a noted speaker on Internet business strategy, go-to-market strategy and strategic consulting, as well as personal strategies for individuals to raise their profile and develop business using social networking. =Early career= Upon returning home to the United States while working for a country club, Baynes watched Google News for a suitable Internet start-up to join. Noticing that LinkedIn was opening offices close to the former PayPal operations in Omaha, Nebraska, close to one of his extended family bases, in 2007 Baynes became company employee No. 162. At LinkedIn, Baynes became responsible for envisaging and delivering the company's customer operations and internal training, supporting the network's now more that 250 million members. Business Ventures =PeopleLinx= While working at LinkedIn together, Baynes and Nathan Egan pitched to LinkedIn's board the idea of offering professional services. After the proposal was turned down, Baynes and Egan co-founded Philadelphia-based PeopleLinx in 2009. With the aim to help large corporate organizations and their employees get the most out of social networks, during the first two years of operations the company offered LinkedIn-focused consulting and training programs, but the primarily Fortune 500 corporate customers wanted something with scale that would offer continued engagement beyond the training, together with associated metrics of success. The result was the SaaS-based PeopleLinx, the world's first engagement, social selling, and analytics software for social media. Through enabling a company's employees to improve their social media influence, the SaaS enables their employers brand to raise its profile, improve market and customer engagement,n and there by directly increase revenue and sales. As Head of Partnerships, Baynes was responsible for all client-facing services, partnerships and social sales strategy. Having founded and developed the company through financial bootstrapping, in May 2012 state-funded economic-development organization the Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern Pennsylvania approved a $150,000 investment in the firm. In March 2013, PeopleLinx raised $3.2 million in a series A funding round from both angel investors and investment firms, including: Bala Cynwyd-based Osage Venture Partners; New York-based Greycroft Partners; and Center City-based Mission Operators Group. =Game Time Updates= In 2015, he left PeopleLinx to work on a new startup called Game Time Updates, founded with help from Michael Coupe and Will Dyson, developer. Game Time Updates aimed to be a social media automated marketing software and tool for the restaurant, bar, and beverage industry. The service boasted the ability to monetize social following, keep social media updated with consistently high quality content, reporting, and an opportunity to pair brands with college and professional sports teams. =UpdatesCentral= UpdatesCentral, a customer engagement and lead generator for social media, was founded by Patrick Baynes in June 2009. Baynes is CEO of UpdatesCentral and leads vision, execution, and customer relationships. The idea occurred to him by observing a busy local eatery's social accounts as they were rarely updated despite massive opportunities, and the unsuitable current options for doing so. In 2011, Will Dyson joined as CTO and in 2014, Michael Coupe joined as co- founder and COO. Launched in January 2015, UpdatesCentral now boasts 500 small business clients and publishes 2,000 to 3,000 social media posts a day.

Rizal is regarded as one of the greatest national heroes of the Philippines. The house is designated as a National Shrine (Level 1) by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. It is located along Mercado Street and Rizal Street in Calamba's Poblacion 5 and is in close proximity to St. John the Baptist Parish Church and the City College of Calamba.  History  Rizal's father, Francisco Rizal Mercado, took two years to build the original Rizal ancestral house. The Spanish authorities confiscated the house in 1891. Paciano Rizal, brother of Jos√© Rizal, reoccupied the house during the Philippine Revolution, but lost it again to the friars. It was subsequently sold, destroyed in World War II and eventually demolished. The government bought what remained of the Rizal House for ‚Ç± 24,000. In 1949, President Elpidio Quirino passed Executive Order no.145, facilitating reconstruction of the house. Filipino school children provided most of the funding for the project while Juan F. Nakpil served as the supervising architect. Staying true to the original home, the reconstructed house occupies the same site and is built from the materials during the time the house was built. On June 19, 1950, the newly built home was inaugurated and now serves as a repository for Rizal's memorabilia. During the Centenary of the Philippine Independence in 1998, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts in cooperation with the National Centennial Commission, decided that Rizal's Shrine should focus specifically on his childhood. The house is intended to provide an accurate representation of the home Rizal grew up in until his formal schooling in Bi√±an (where Rizal was born.) Rizal's anecdotes often reference his childhood home, recounting the nipa hut in the garden where he learned to sleep and sculpt; the kitchen where he learned the alphabet; the bedroom where he learned to pray; the library where he discovered books and the azotea where he listened to his grandmother's stories of \\"skeletons, buried treasures and trees that bloomed with diamonds.\\" Near Rizal's home is the church where he was baptised. Saint John the Baptist Church.  Features  The Rizal Shrine is a typical rectangular Bahay na Bato, reminiscent of upper-class Filipino homes built during the Spanish Colonial era. The lower portion is made of adobe stone and brick, while the upper portion consists of hardwood. The original interior flooring of the house was discovered during reconstruction and utilized. It has sliding windows made of capiz shells, the exterior walls are painted green (originally white) and the roof is constructed of red ceramic tile. In June 2009, the National Historical Institute (now National Historical Commission of the Philippines) ordered the shrine's repainting to highlight the meaning of Rizal's surname. The ground floor of the house historically served as a stable for horses and carriages. It contains several exhibits on Rizal's childhood, including exact copies of Rizal's writings, drawings and original baptismal certificate. The upper floor served as the family's living quarters and consisted of: the living room, dining area, bathroom and library. Containing more than 1000 books, a caida serves as Francisco Mercado's library, the largest private library in Calamba at that time. Adjacent to the library is the family's formal dining room, where Rizal's parents hosted guests and other prominent members of the society. The caida is connected to a sala, which leads to three bedrooms: the boys' room (for Jose and Paciano), the girls' room for his 9 sisters and the master bedroom. The biggest among all the rooms, the master bedroom contains the four-poster bed where Rizal was born. Going beyond the sala is an informal dining room or comedor. Prominent in this room is the punkah, a large rectangular Indian fan. Next to the comedor and the azotea is an old well, one of the only surviving features of the original house. Calambajf2779 09.JPGOriginal view of Rizal Shrine before it was painted green Rizal Shrine Indoor (Calamba, Laguna).jpgInside the Rizal Shrine Statue of the little Jose Rizal in their house in Calamba, Laguna..jpgStatue of little Rizal Built in 1997, a gallery, library, audio-visual room and shop of Rizal memorabilia reside adjacent to the shrine. The shrine has a large lawn with a replica of the nipa hut and a statue depicting young Rizal with his dog. The statue was constructed in 1996 by Dudley Diaz for the centennial celebration commemorating Rizal's death. The remains of Rizal's parents, Francisco Rizal Mercado (father) Teodora Alonso Realonda (mother), are also located in the shrine.

It will honor members of the armed forces who participated in Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield. The National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act () authorized the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to establish a memorial in the capital without use of federal funds. The bill was incorporated into Howard P. \\"Buck\\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 () and was enacted in December 2014. Background The Gulf War (2 August 1990 ‚Äì 28 February 1991), codenamed Operation Desert Storm (17 January 1991 ‚Äì 28 February 1991) was a war waged by coalition forces from 34 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait. The war is also known under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, Kuwait War, or the First Iraq War, before the term \\"Iraq War\\" became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War (also referred to in the U.S. as \\"Operation Iraqi Freedom\\").Operation Iraqi Freedom: Strategies, Approaches, Results, and Issues for Congress. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2014-05-24. Kuwait's invasion by Iraqi troops that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation, and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council. U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the Coalition, the biggest coalition since World War II. The great majority of the Coalition's military forces were from the U.S., with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Saudi Arabia paid around US$36 billion of the US$60 billion cost. Operation Desert Shield was the codename for a \\"wholly defensive\\" United States mission to prevent Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia. Operation Desert Shield began on 7 August 1990 when U.S. troops were sent to Saudi Arabia due also to the request of its monarch, King Fahd, who had earlier called for U.S. military assistance. This \\"wholly defensive\\" doctrine was quickly abandoned when, on 8 August, Iraq declared Kuwait to be Iraq's 19th province and Saddam named his cousin, Ali Hassan Al-Majid, as its military-governor. Approximately 500,000 Americans served in operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield. There were 382 American fatalities. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act would authorize the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to establish a commemorative work on federal land in the District of Columbia to commemorate and honor those who, as members of the Armed Forces, served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield. The bill would prohibit the use of federal funds to pay any expense to establish the commemorative work. The bill would require the Association, upon payment of all expenses for the memorial's establishment (including perpetual maintenance and preservation expenses), to transmit any remaining balance to the United States Secretary of the Interior for deposit in the separate account with the National Park Foundation (NPF) established for crediting money provided by a sponsor of a commemorative work. The bill would require any remaining balance transmitted to the separate NPF account upon expiration of the authority to establish the commemorative work to be available to the Secretary or to the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA), as appropriate, following a specified process. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on April 9, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 503 would authorize a nonprofit organization to establish a commemorative work on federal lands in the District of Columbia. Enacting the legislation would affect direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the net effect on the budget would not be significant in any year. Enacting H.R. 503 would not affect revenues. The legislation would authorize the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to establish a memorial to honor members of the armed forces who participated in Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield. The memorial project, which would be completed without the use of federal funds, would be subject to the requirements of the Commemorative Works Act. Under that act, any entity that receives a permit to construct a memorial in the District of Columbia or its environs must donate to the National Park Foundation (a nonprofit organization) an amount equal to 10 percent of the memorial‚Äôs estimated construction cost. That amount, as well as any project funds remaining after construction of the memorial, would be available in future years for maintenance of the memorial. Based on the experience of similar commemorative projects, CBO expects that any amounts collected by the federal government would not be received for several years and would be offset by a transfer to the National Park Foundation (a nonfederal entity) soon thereafter. H.R. 503 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not impose a cost on state, local, or tribal governments. On January 24, 2014, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for , the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on November 21, 2013. The two bills are similar and the CBO cost estimates are the same. Procedural history The National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 5, 2014 by Rep. David P. Roe (R, TN-1). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. The bill was reported (amended) by the committee on May 6, 2014 alongside House Report 113-437. Rep. Roe, who introduced the bill, said \\"I believe we should honor the commitment of every man and woman that honorably serves this country, and I am proud to see this bill move forward.\\" AMVETS supported the bill, with their National Executive Director Stewart Hickey saying that they were pleased that \\"Gulf War veterans can finally be recognized for their valiant service to our nation.\\" The American Legion, the National Guard Association of the United States, and the Air Force Association also supported the bill. On May 28, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 242 to pass the bill 370-0.  Monument planning  A subsequent bill enacted in March 2017 authorized the construction in the restricted Area 1 near the National Mall, which will expire in March 2024. The Commission of Fine Arts approved a location north of the Lincoln Memorial in 2018 and approved a conceptual design in November 2019. Lead designer OLIN anticipates completion in 2021. The design has curved walls surrounding a central water feature. The National Desert Storm Memorial Association, however, must raise another $22 million of its $40 million goal before it can begin construction.

Early years  Varshavsky was born in 1906 in the southern port city of Odessa into an educated middle-class Jewish family. His father Pyotr Moiseevich Varshavsky was a physician, specialised in skin diseases and sexually transmitted infections. His mother Elza Filippovna Kalmeyer was descended from a large and prosperous family of textile merchants from the town of Grobi≈Üa in Courland. In 1921, Varshavsky joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party. In 1921-22 he was arrested three times by the Odessa Government Extraordinary Commission (Cheka) and then moved to Moscow where he found a job as a proof- reader at several Komsomol-run publishers. In 1923, after another arrest Varshavsky deserted the Socialist Revolutionary Party and moved to Yekaterinburg, where he worked as an editor at the Ural region publishing house Uralkniga. In October 1924 he returned to Moscow where he worked first as a secretary in the editor's office of the Moscow branch of the Leningrad publishing house Khudozhestvennaya Literatur–∞, then as a proof-reader at the publishing house Novaya Moskva and at the printers of the Der Emes publishers. Sergei Varshavsky also worked as a copyreader for the newspaper Vechernyaya Moskva until 1928.  Writing  From 1928 to 1930, Varshavsky was on active military duty in Leningrad, serving in the Baltic naval aviation. Varshavsky edited the first air force newspaper, Vozdushnik Baltiki, and joined the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP). In 1930, after naval discharge, he became an executive editor of the magazines Zalp and Stroyka. From 1932 until 1937 Varshavsky was in charge of literature and drama broadcasting at the Leningrad radio committee whilst serving as head of Critics and Bibliography at the newspaper Leningradskaya Pravda. He was a member of the Union of Soviet Writers from its foundation in 1934. Sergei Varshavsky published a number of works on history and literature, as well as many art, literary and history of art criticism pieces in Moscow and Leningrad newspapers and magazines. From April 1937 to the start of World War Two he was editorial secretary of the Leningrad branch of the Union of Theatre Workers of the Russian Federation and an editor of the Leningrad film studio LenTechFilm. From 1931 to the end of his life he collaborated with the writer B.Rest (which was the pen-name of Yuliy Isaakovich Shapiro) and published as co-authors.

In the following 34 years, Varshavsky became a persistent and enthusiastic collector. He created impressive collections of English and French lithography from the first half of the 19th century (including Paul Gavarni, Hippolyte Bellang√©, Richard Parkes Bonington, James Duffield Harding, Nicolas Toussaint Charlet), of the Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints from the Edo period (Harunobu, Hokusai, Hiroshige, Toyokuni, Kunisada, Kuniyoshi and many others), as well as art and craft items, in particular Japanese (netsuke, tsuba, etc.) and Chinese ornaments (snuff bottles, ceramics, lacquer, carved ivory). Apart from that he assembled a large library which consists of art history, fiction and reference volumes. His entire collection and library were all based at his modest ground-floor apartment in Leningrad. Many said that visiting this flat was truly unforgettable.\\"It was very difficult to find his apartment. I had to make my way through courtyards, passing rubbish bins and the picturesque back streets of St. Petersburg. I remember that visit as a trip to Aladdin‚Äôs cave. The tiny ground floor apartment was stuffed with closets and cabinets which contained ‚Äî from floor to ceiling ‚Äî antique Chinese vases, sculptures of different dynasties, Japanese woodblock prints, netsuke, porcelain, Thai majolica, terracotta from Inner Mongolia‚Ä¶ Apart from being packed in closets, all these treasures were piled up on the sofa, on the floor, on the chairs ‚Äî all over the house. It was impossible to comprehend how the owner of the house managed to find a place to live in this museum storeroom.\\" The main objects from the collection were at different times either sold or given as gifts by Sergei Varshavsky or his descendants to the Hermitage and Pushkin Museum and were exhibited many times–§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü—É–∑—Å–∫–∞—è –∏ –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –ª–∏—Ç–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏–Ω—ã XIX –≤–µ–∫–∞. –ò–∑–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ª–∏—Å—Ç—ã –∏–∑ –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –°.–ü.–í–∞—Ä—à–∞–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ. // –ú. ‚Äî –°–æ–≤. —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫. ‚Äî 1985.

Once at-risk individuals are identified, drug toxicity can be prevented using elective dose reduction or prescription of a different medication.Church D, Kerr R, Domingo E, Rosmarin D, Palles C, Maskell K, Tomlinson I, Kerr D (2014). \\"'Toxgnostics': an unmet need in cancer medicine\\".

Medscape Oncology, Kerr on Oncology. 28 August 2014.  Background  The majority of toxgnostic studies have been candidate gene studies restricted to the known Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion genes (ADME) of drug treated patients. The PharmaADME consortiumPharmaADME consortium. Michael S. Phillips Ph.D. Retrieved 30 Dec 2014. identified 32 core genes containing 184 variants within common pathways that should be included in ADME candidate gene studies of toxicity biomarkers. Toxicity biomarkers that have been clinically validated using this restricted panel of genes include the P450 cytochrome assay that is currently recommended for routine clinical use of the oral anticoagulant warfarin. Using next-generation sequencing methods and genome-wide association studies a more comprehensive toxgnostic approach can be utilized through unbiased analysis of several million variants across the whole human genome, including introns and exons, for pharmacogenomic markers of drug induced toxicity. Cancer drugs have been highlighted as particularly appropriate candidates for toxgnostic studies due to the significant toxicity profiles associated with both targeted therapiesWidakowich C, de Castro G Jr, de Azambuja E, Dinh P, Awada A (2007). \\"Review: Side Effects of Approved Molecular Targeted Therapies in Solid Cancers\\". Oncologist (12):1443‚Äì1455. and chemotherapy.Walko CM, McLeod H (2009). \\"Pharmacogenomic progress in individualized dosing of key drugs for cancer patients\\". Nature Clinical Practice Oncology (6):153-162. doi:10.1038/ncponc1303. Most cancer patients obtain only modest benefit from treatment, whereas toxicity is common and often associated with severe side effects which include considerable morbidity and mortality. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs 5-fluorouracil (5FU) prescribed as adjuvant therapy following surgical resection of early stage colorectal cancer benefits only approx. 4% of patients, whereas 30‚Äì40% of those treated will suffer severe toxicity such as neutropenia, mucositis, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea, and stomatitis, fatal toxicities will kill 0.5-1% of people treated.Quasar Collaborative Group, Gray R, Barnwell J, McConkey C, Hills RK, Williams NS, Kerr, DJ (2007)\\"Adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation in patients with colorectal cancer: a randomised study.\\" Lancet 370: 2020‚Äì2029. . Through the use of toxgnostic screens a number of genetic variants have now been identified that can be used to predict 5FU toxicity prior to treatment.Rosmarin D, Palles C, Pagnamenta A, Kaur K, Pita G, Martin M, Domingo E, Jones A, Howarth K, Freeman-Mills L, Johnstone E, Wang H, Love S, Scudder C, Julier P, Fern√°ndez-Rozadilla C, Ruiz-Ponte C, Carracedo A, Castellvi-Bel S, Castells A, Gonzalez-Neira A, Taylor J, Kerr R, Kerr D, Tomlinson I (2014). Gut. doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2013-306571. These genetic variants can be used to identify the individuals predisposed to severe drug toxicity and the dose of 5FU chemotherapy can be reduced to prevent severe toxic side effects. Toxgnostic biomarker tests currently available for use in clinical practice include markers for irinotecan, thioguanine, warfarin and 5FU.  Toxgnostic principles  Toxgnostic studies are defined by four key elements: # Analysis should be embedded within large, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials (i.e. Phase III clinical trials) # The phenotype of interest should be clinically relevant and clearly defined using internationally standardized criteria and systematically captured such as the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3‚Äì5 toxicity. # Analysis should be unbiased to encompass the maximum relevant genomic diversity, rather than being limited by what is often a superficial understanding of the pathways involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the agent. # The performance of individual variants should be compared with that of a combined risk score, which may outperform each individual variant when they are analysed separately. Appropriate analytical approaches for toxgnostic studies include candidate gene studies, GWAS and whole genome sequencing. GWAS and whole genome sequencing are the most comprehensive approaches though careful considerations must be applied to the relevance, analysis and interpretation of the results to prevent over-fitting, which produces false-positive results, a proposed GWAS workflow is shown below. Proposed clinical trial paradigm for discovery of toxgnostics markers through GWAS.  Regulatory oversight of toxgnostic tests  Toxicity biomarkers can be co-developed and co-approved with the respective drug as a companion diagnostic test, this requires premarket approval (PMA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) IVD Companion Diagnostic Device guidance issued in draft 14 July 2011 states that a companion diagnostic test can be used to ‚ÄúIdentify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product‚Äù. Additionally there are guidelines for the submission of pharmacogenomic studies from the FDA and draft guidance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Her grandfather was a village mullah. 1920 working as a teacher in the village of Samara province Dengizbaevo; 1920 study in the Tatar-Bashkir Pedagogical College in Samara; 1932 study at the Moscow Institute for the preparation of the editors; 1935 ‚Äì 1937 studies at the Bashkir Pedagogical Institute; 1933 work in the literary staff of the newspaper BASSR Baimaksky region (along with her husband, writer Bashkir lip Davletshin subsequently Commissar of Education, Bashkir ASSR); In 1937‚Äì1942, as the wife of the repressed People's Commissar of Education of the Bashkir ASSR, Gubay Davletshin, was imprisoned. In 1942, Davletshina was released due to illness, then to death lived in exile in Birsk. She died in 1954 in Birsk from tuberculosis. Museum of Hadiya Davletshina in Birsk Hadiya Ilyasova received her primary education in a rural madrasah, then in a Soviet school. When her father died in 1919, the girl had to take care of the family. Hadiya had to work to feed a deaf mother and three brothers and sisters. During the Civil War in Russia (1918‚Äì1920), Hadiya became one of the first Komsomol (Youth organization) members in the district. From the age of 15, Hadiya Ilyasova began to work as a teacher in the neighboring village of Dengizbaevo. Several times she miraculously managed to escape from the reprisals organized by opponents of the Soviet regime. In 1920, she became a student of the Tatar-Bashkir Pedagogical College in Samara. In 1922, at the age of 17, she married her fellow countryman Gubay Davletshin, who then worked in the Samara Provincial Committee. In 1923 they had a son, Bulat. But the boy was weak and soon died. They had no more children. Here she began to study Russian, first became acquainted with the works of Russian classics. Her favorite writer was Maxim Gorky. Hadiya was greatly impressed by the novel Mother and other works of the writer. Then she worked in schools, was a teacher in an orphanage. In 1932‚Äì33, –ùadiya studied at the Moscow Publishing Institute. In 1935‚Äì37, she was a student of the Faculty of Language and Literature of the Bashkir Pedagogical Institute named after Timiryazev (now Bashkir State University). In 1933, with her husband, Gubai Davletshin, Hadiya left for Baymak district in the south of Bashkortostan , where she works as an employee of the regional newspaper. In 1934, she participated in the I Congress of Soviet Writers, met with Maxim Gorky . In 1935 she joined the Writers Union of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1936, she was a delegate to the III plenum of writers of the USSR in Minsk. The first story of Hadiya Davletshina \\"Hylyukai Pioneer\\" was published in 1926 in the newspaper \\"Bashkortostan yeshtere\\" (\\"Youth of Bashkortostan\\"). In 1931, the story \\"Aybika\\" was published, bringing the writer wide fame. In 1936, the story was translated into Russian. For the first time in Bashkir literature, the process of the formation of the personality of a simple Bashkir woman after the 1917 revolution, under the conditions of Soviet power, was deeply and thoroughly shown. Aybika was able to free herself from traditional restrictions and became a tractor driver. So the writer showed an example of the struggle for women's rights Hadiya Davletshina.Bashkir Encyclopedia. Hadiya Davletshina wrote a lot and fruitfully. Her poems, essays and stories were constantly published. In 1932, her story \\"Waves of Ears\\" was published, later a storybook, the story \\"Flaming Years\\". Everywhere where Davletshins lived, their house was open to friends, relatives, fellow countrymen who needed help. They helped many to get settled in life, to get an education. One of them, the orphan girl Fatima Mustafina, later became the Minister of Education of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist RepublicFatima Mustafina. In the early 30s, the writer began work on the epic novel Irgiz. Some excerpts from it were published in periodicals. For the first time in Bashkir literature, the main character of a major work was the people. The life of the Bashkir people has been shown for two decades against a broad background of social and political events taking place in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century. In her novel, the writer skillfully uses knowledge of the life and way of life of the people, shows the colorful characters and mentality of the Bashkirs. The use of the wealth of oral folklore, the colorfulness and richness of the language, the epic scale made the novel a classic work not only of Bashkir, but also of all Oriental and Turkic-speaking literature. Speaking at the First Congress of Writers of the RSFSR in 1958, Leonid Sobolev said: \\"Without knowing Hadia Davletshina‚Äôs novel Irgiz, one cannot understand the reality of the Bashkir people.\\" The Kazakh writer Sabit Mukanov called her work a creative feat. Hadiya Davletshina is called the first woman novelist of the East. The active work of Hadiya Davletshina on the novel was brutally interrupted. 1937‚Äì1938 in the history of the Soviet Union are called the period of the Great Terror. In 1937, her husband, People's Commissar of Education of the BASSR Gubay Davletshin, was arrested and later shot. He did a lot for the development of the education and culture of the Bashkir Republic. Hadiya Davletshina, as a ‚Äúmember of the family of the enemy of the people‚Äù, was sentenced to five years in prison, which she spent in Mordovia The true —Åriminal case of a family member of the traitor of the Motherland Hadiya Davletshina . Here she worked with other prisoners and mentally continued her novel Irgiz. In conclusion, her tuberculosis worsened . In 1942, she was released due to illness. Hadia wanted to return to Ufa, but she was sent to exile in Birsk without the right to leave. In Birsk, Hadiya Davletshina lived in great need. She was not given work. She was strictly forbidden to publish her works and engage in literary activities. In the last years of her life, she worked as a cleaner at the Birsk Pedagogical Institute. On 20 March 1951, Hadiya Davletshina wrote a letter to the chairman of the board of the Union of Writers of the USSR, Alexander Fadeev, in which she asked for help with the publication of the novel. This letter is written on six pages, on the sheets there are many spots from the tears of the writer. In Birsk, after some time, Hadiya married Safin, who took care of her and managed to extend her life a bit. Hadiya Davletshina died on 5 December 1954.She did not see her novel published. The novel \\"Irgiz\\" was published only in 1957. He came out in a large circulation in the Bashkir book publishing house. Later he came out in Russian, published in the languages of the peoples of the USSR. In 1985, a collection of novels and short stories by the writer Aybika was published in Bashknigoizdat. In 2005, the publishing house \\"Kitap\\" published the volume of selected works of Hadiya Davletshina. In 1967, for the novel \\"Irgiz\\", the writer posthumously became the first laureate of the Republican Prize of the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic named after Salawat Yulayev . Despite a serious illness, Hadiya Davletshina wrote a lot, but her works were not allowed to publish. After the death of writer, her mother Guliaohar (blind) gave Hadiya\`s manuscripts to people who promised to publish them. The investigation has not yet yielded any result.

In May 2013, their brewery and taproom opened to the public with distribution of kegs and cans in the Duluth area beginning shortly thereafter. In November 2013, limited distribution of cans to liquor stores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area began. An expansion was simultaneously announced with a stated goal of expanding production from 4,500 bbl to 8,000 bbl per year. As of 2015, Bent Paddle reported 13,850 bbl produced for the year.  History  It was founded by Bryon & Karen Tonnis and Colin & Laura Mullen. Bryon Tonnis had most recently worked as the head brewer at the Rock Bottom Brewery location in Minneapolis while Colin Mullen had been the head brewer at Barley John's Brew Pub in New Brighton, Minnesota. Karen Tonnis manages the brewery's operations and distribution while Laura Mullen manages outreach and events (areas in which both have prior professional experience). The origin of the brewery's name comes from both a bent canoe paddle Bryon Tonnis had used to mix his brewing mash as well as the brewers' shared love of canoeing. The original taproom closed to the public in April 2018, while a new one opened just a block away. The original building remains Bent Paddle's primary brewing facility.  Awards  As part of their \\"Best of MN\\" awards, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune named Bent Paddle the best new brewery in Greater Minnesota for 2014. The brewery also won a bronze medal at the 2014 Great American Beer Festival for their 14¬∞ ESB. The same beer won gold at the 2017 festival.  Logo dispute  In August 2014, Long Trail Brewing Company filed a trademark infringement suit against Bent Paddle for using a logo of a hiker with a backpack similar to their own. The suit was amicably settled in December 2014 with Bent Paddle agreeing to discontinue the use of that logo and both breweries making charitable donations to hiking-related groups in one another's states.

It is also a feminist Internet meme. A shortened hashtag version of the phrase not all men are like that, it is sometimes abbreviated NAMALT. A Time magazine article on the subject states that \\"Not all men\\" was previously stated as an object of frustration, but in early 2014 it became usually used as an object of mockery. Intended to counter generalizations about men's behavior, some critics claim the phrase deflects conversations from uncomfortable topics, such as sexual assault. Origin Vox states that the phrase \\"not all men are like that,\\" as a general defense of men in gendered criticisms of their behavior, has been around for more than a decade. Before 2013, \\"not all men\\" was not seen as a derailment tactic; the most common strategies cited by feminist bloggers were \\"'what about the men?' and 'patriarchy hurts men too'‚Äîpleas for inclusion, not for exemption\\". Jasmine Bailey says the \\"not all men\\" argument \\"seemingly began as a sincere way to counter feminist arguments\\". #NotAllMen, however, is often impugned by feminists. The #NotAllMen Twitter hashtag was tweeted as early as 2011. The first viral tweet with this phrase, which was not yet a hashtag, was a satirical tweet by Shafiqah Hudson in February 2013: \\"ME: Men and boys are socially instructed to not listen to us. They are taught to interrupt us when we‚Äì RANDOM MAN: Excuse me. Not ALL men.\\" The stereotypical \\"Not-All-Men\\", barging into a conversation criticizing male behavior, was caricatured in a comic by artist Matt Lubchansky on April 14, 2014. Lubchansky's comic was quickly retweeted and otherwise shared by several male celebrities including Wil Wheaton, Paul F. Tompkins, Matt Fraction, and John Scalzi. 2014 Isla Vista killings #NotAllMen was already a Twitter hashtag created by the Twitter user Sassycrass before the 2014 Isla Vista killings, but it gained additional traction after the event, because of the hatred against women expressed by the murderer, Elliot Rodger (although only two of the six casualties were women). In response to the hashtag #NotAllMen, an anonymous female Twitter user created the hashtag #YesAllWomen, to express that all women are affected by sexism and misogyny, even though not all men are sexist. This newly created hashtag quickly became used by women throughout social media to share their experiences of sexual discrimination and attacks.For coverage of this topic, see the following sources:   * Following the killing spree, the attacker's Internet activity was described as misogynistic, and hatred of women was cited as a factor in the killing spree. In the wake of the killings, some Twitter users pointed out the fact that \\"not all men\\" are like this, or would commit such crimes. Bengaluru incident After reports of a mass molestation occurring at India's Bengaluru New Year's Eve celebration, #NotAllMen began trending on Twitter. This drew an angry reaction from women, with many Indian feminists and women strongly criticizing the hashtag while responding with their own hashtag #YesAllWomen. Usage Kelsey McKinney of Vox states, \\"The phrase has been reappropriated by feminists and turned into a meme meant to parody its pervasiveness and bad faith.\\" #NotAllMen-related memes include references to Aquaman, Adventure Time, Magic: The Gathering, and the Kool-Aid Man crashing through a wall to exclaim \\"not all men\\". An explanation of the NotAllMen hashtag came from Hillary Di Menna of This Magazine, who claimed that: \\"Saying 'not all men' is not helpful. We need to listen and we need to reflect\\".

Around 621 BC the people of Athens commissioned Draco to devise a written law code and constitution, giving him the title of the first legislator of Athens. The literate could read the code at a central location accessible to anyone. This enactment of a rule of law was an early manifestation of Athenian democracy. Background The need for written laws began with the unequal access to legal knowledge by the aristocracy and the people; the established laws of Athens were inefficiently formulated in the spoken language and often modified and re-evaluated. The aristocratic exploitation of this system began during the mid-seventh century BC, and laws were often amended to benefit the aristocracy.\\"The distinctive privilege which the nobles had always enjoyed was the exclusive knowledge and administration of the laws. They were, then, open to the charge of exercising this privilege in their own favor.\\" - Athenian Political Commissions by Frederick Danesbury Smith This triggered feuds by families ignorant of the law in an attempt to obtain justice.\\"Murders were settled by members of the victim's family, who would then go and kill the murderer. This often began endless blood feuds.\\" - To minimize the incidence of these feuds, the governing aristocratic families of Athens decided to abandon their concealed system of legal proposals and amendments and promulgate them to Athenian society in writing. They authorized Draco, an aristocratic legislator,\\"He was elected as one of the nine archons, but was not the archon eponymous.\\" - Athenian Political Commissions, page 12, by Frederick Danesbury Smith to construct the written constitution, and he began to write the text around 621 BC. To promulgate the new constitution, its text was inscribed on displaying devices.\\"'Axones' and 'kyrbeis' are names given to structures that contained the law codes of Draco and Solon in ancient Athens during the Archaic Age.\\" - http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/greekterms/g/Axones.htm; These two terms are debated in specificity to their materialistic structure and functionality. The following quote describes both terms: \\"Robertson says [describes such information in Solon's Axones and Kyrbeis, and the Sixth-Century Background (Figs. 1-2), Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, (2nd Qtr., 1986), pp. 147-176] axones and kyrbeis were not names for the same thing: the axones were revolving wooden beams, while kyrbeis were standing pillars in the Royal Stoa.\\" - http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/greekterms/g/Axones.htm; The following describes the term \\"axone\\" particularly: \\"These beams were called axones, a word meaning 'axles,' because the ends of each beam were pivoted and placed within a frame in such a way that they could be rotated.\\" - James Sickinger, Literacy, Documents, and Archives in the Ancient Athenian Democracy, The American Archivist, (Fall, 1999), pp. 229-246 As a result, the Draconian constitution was accessible to the literate. Draco introduced the concepts of intentional and unintentional homicide,\\"Another result of the codification of laws by Draco -- and the only part that remained part of the legal code -- was the introduction of the concept of 'intention to murder.'\\" - http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/greecehellas1/a/cylonanddraco_3.htm with both crimes adjudicated at the Areopagus.\\"Any person who felt himself wronged might lay an information before the Council of Areopagus, on declaring what law was broken by the wrong done to him.\\" - Since murder cases were tried by the state, feuds as a form of justice became illegal. The homicide laws were the only laws retained by the early-6th-century BC Solonian Constitution.\\"We know nothing about what Drakon's [Draco's] nomoi were.

Kenyon (translator) In Constitution of the Athenians =Setting= Aristotle's timeline of the Draconian constitution is characterized by the vague phrase \\"not very long after\\": Given the founding of Athens by Cecrops I and its first constitution in 1556 BC, its legal framework would have functioned for over 900 years before Draco codified the laws and drafted his constitution around 620 BC. Therefore, subsequently, commentators assume that the phrase \\"not very long after\\" refers instead to the more-recent Cylonian affair. =Prytanes= Aristotle's undefined use of \\"Prytanes\\" refers to a number of Athenian state positions during and after the development of the Draconian constitution: \\"Prytanes\\" later referred to the fifty members of the Council, although their only other appearance in the context of the Draconian constitution was in Herodotus' account of the Cylonian affair (where the \\"Prytanes of Naucrari\\" are mentioned). This may have occurred due to Herodotus' (a Dorian) habit of referring to the first magistrates of Dorian cities as \\"Prytanes of Naucrari\\" and conflating them with the first magistrates of Athens (the Archons). Thucydides' more-detailed version also refers to Herodotus' \\"Prytanes of Naucrari.\\" \\"Those,\\" he wrote, \\"to whom the people had confided the keeping of the citadel, seeing the partisans of Cylon perish at the feet of the statue of Minerva, caused them to go out of the citadel, promising them that no harm would be done to them.\\" As Thucydides had mentioned in his account of the Cylonian affair, the nine Archons were the people entrusted with the citadel.\\"Each tribe was divided into three Trittyes [=Thirds], with twelve Naucraries in each; and the Naucraries had officers of their own, called Naucrari, whose duty it was to superintend the current receipts and expenditure.\\" - http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/athenian_const.1.1.html, Constitution of the Athenians, Aristotle, Frederic G.

Agreement about the mission was reached in January 2014, and the first operations started at the end of April. The mission ended its mandate after nearly a year on 15 March 2015.http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/csdp/missions-and-operations/eufor- rca/index_en.htm  Background  In 2012 the Central African Republic was embroiled in internal conflict, resulting in the ousting of the Christian president Francois Bozize in March 2013. Michel Djotodia, the leader of Muslim S√©l√©ka rebels, assumed the presidency but was himself forced to resign in January 2014. According to the UN Refugee Agency, 37,000 people have escaped to neighboring countries, while 173,000 have been internally displaced. In December 2013, peacekeeping missions Operation Sangaris by France and MISCA by the African Union were mounted. On 20 January 2014, EU foreign ministers reached agreement for the creation of EUFOR RCA, which is the ninth EU military operation in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy. On 28 January, United Nations Security Council resolution 2134 approved deployment of the EU force into the Central African Republic. The military operation was established on 10 February, with major general Philippe Ponti√®s as its commander.  Deployment  On 30 April 2014, EUFOR RCA started its first major operation by taking over security at the Bangui M'Poko International Airport. The initial force consisted of 150 troops, and was contributed by former colonial power France and by Estonia.* During May and June troops from Finland, Georgia, Latvia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Spain as well as military advisors from Luxembourg joined the force. On 15 June it achieved full operational capability with 700 troops. The EU mission is planned to last for half a year, with the overall goal to secure a safe environment in the Bangui area, and afterwards hand it over to African partners who should arrive with a 12,000 troop United Nations peacekeeper force in September. On 28 August 2014, troops from Italy joined the force with 50 paratroopers from Folgore Parachute Brigade. According to some experts, the mission is unlikely to achieve all its objectives in the planned time frame, and training of local security forces will probably continue into 2015.

He also appeared in a few film shorts. Career Velie was born in Denver, Colorado, on 16 May 1892. He became an actor and singer, first appearing on stage in 1912. His career on Broadway lasted for over fifty 50 years, often appearing with his sister, Janet. Jay Velie, 1921 in the New York Clipper Velie's first Broadway lead was in Little Jesse James (1923‚Äì24). Little Jessie James was written by Harlan Thompson, the author of the book and the lyrics. The music was by Harry Archer. It was produced by L. Lawrence Weber. Nan Halperin played Jessie Jamieson, in pursuit of Jay Velie as Paul Revere. Little Jessie James was the biggest hit of the season, and I Love You, performed by Halpern and Velie, was the biggest hit of all the songs from that season's musicals. After this, Velie continued to play in Broadway shows, included several major hits, until his final role in 70, Girls, 70 in 1971. Valie formed a song-and-dance vaudeville team with Ren√©e Robert. On 4 January 1925 they opened the one-act musical Terpsichore and Troubadour by Rodgers and Hart at the Palace Theatre. Later they took this act on the road. Velie was among the cast of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel, which opened at the Majestic Theatre on 19 April 1945 and ran for 890 performances. This may have been the greatest of the Rodgers and Hammerstein scores. Velie was cast as Senator Brockbank in the Irving Berlin musical Call Me Madam, produced by Leland Hayward and directed by George Abbott. It opened at the Imperial Theatre on 12 October 1950 and ran for 644 performances. Velie played \\"Mr. M.\\" in the musical Happy Hunting directed by Abe Burrows, which opened on 6 December 1956 at the Majestic Theatre and ran for 412 performances. The show won several Tony nominations for members of the cast. The Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music reopened at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on 16 November 1959 and played for 1,443 performances. Velie played Admiral von Schreiber as a replacement. Velie appeared in Jennie, a musical by Arnold Schulman that opened at the Majestic on 17 October 1963 and ran for 82 performances. He again played Admiral von Schreiber in a revival of The Sound of Music that played for 23 performances from 26 April 1967 to 14 May 1967 at the New York City Center. This version received lukewarm reviews. Jay Velie died of congestive failure on 22 April 1982 at his home in Larchmont, New York, aged 89.

A second battle broke out at the airport on 28 September 2014. Background The Ukrainian government started an \\"anti-terrorist\\" operation against pro-Russian insurgents in the Donetsk Oblast in early April 2014. Pro- Russian protesters and insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic captured and occupied numerous government buildings, towns, and territories in the region. In Donetsk city itself, many government buildings were under separatist control. Donetsk International Airport remained outside of insurgent control. Events During the morning of 26 May, pro-Russian separatist insurgents captured the terminal buildings of Donetsk International Airport, and demanded the withdrawal of government forces from the area. The militants also blocked off the road to the airport. Soon after, the National Guard of Ukraine issued an ultimatum to the insurgents, which said that they should surrender immediately. This was rejected, causing paratroopers to launch an assault on the airport, accompanied by airstrikes against insurgent positions. Attack helicopters were also used to target insurgent anti-aircraft guns. Lorries with separatist reinforcements were seen heading towards the airport. As evening fell, government forces pushed out the insurgents, who then launched a counterattack that was repelled by government forces. Sporadic gunfire was heard during the night, making it unclear if government soldiers were in full control of the airport. The next day, both Ukrainian and pro- Russian leaders confirmed that Ukrainian forces were in full control of the airport, but by mid-morning, machine gun fire could still be heard on one of the main roads leading to the airport. Insurgents built barricades on the road to the airport. Donetsk mayor Oleksandr Lukyanchenko urged all residents to stay in their homes. During the fighting, Druzhba Arena, home of the Kontinental Hockey League team HC Donbass, was ransacked by pro-Russian insurgents, who looted the building, destroyed surveillance equipment, and set it on fire. In the days following the battle, anger toward the Ukrainian government grew among some local residents. According to one resident, many people were thinking of joining the insurgency if government military operations continued. Sporadic fighting also continued, with at least one insurgent being killed in a firefight on 29 May. Six other insurgents died on 31 May, after they attempted to retrieve the bodies of their comrades at the site of the airport battle. =Casualties= Mayor of Donetsk Oleksandr Lukyanchenko said the death toll in the clashes stood at forty, almost all of them separatist insurgents, as well as two civilians. The city morgue reported a death toll of thirty-three insurgents and two civilians. Forty-three insurgents were wounded. DPR leaders Alexander Borodai and Denis Pushilin put the death toll at 100, with half being insurgents and the other half being civilians. This number was considered inflated by the Ukrainian government, and an attempt to lure Russia to intervene in the Donbass. Ukrainian officials reported no losses. 15‚Äì35 of the insurgents were reportedly killed in a single incident when two lorries carrying wounded fighters away from the airport were ambushed in a friendly-fire incident by the Vostok Battalion, which confused them for Ukrainian forces (separatist \\"prime minister\\" Aleksander Boroday announced that they had been ambushed by Ukrainian ground forces and hit by airstrikes). Thirty-four of the dead insurgents were Russian nationals and Donetsk insurgents claimed the bodies were returned to Russia. It was later revealed the bodies were returned covertly to hide the fact that they were Russian, eventually ending up in a Rostov-on-Don morgue in the Russian Federation. Among the dead on the pro-Russian side were former Russian Airborne Troops of the 45th regiment special forces, Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War veterans, and world kick-boxing champion Nikolai Leonov who was a native of Dnipropetrovsk. =Chechen involvement= It was claimed and later verified that forces loyal to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov came to Donetsk to fight alongside the insurgents. Although Kadyrov denied that he sent Chechens to Donetsk, one Chechen fighter claimed that Kadyrov had given them an order to go to Ukraine.

The children's welfare system will forever be changed for the better, and her accomplishments will forever be felt. In addition, many dedications have been made in her honor. In 2000, the Hillsborough County School Board named an elementary school in her honor, the Colleen Bevis Elementary School. The school is located in Lithia, Florida and is home to the Bevis Broncos. According to the Hillsborough County Public School System, \\"In 1987, the cooperative school program for severely emotionally disturbed students at USF's Department of Child and Family Studies was officially named the Colleen Lunsford Bevis School by both USF and Hillsborough County School Board in recognition of her work\\". Located on the same campus at that time, the Colleen Bevis Resource and Education Center held systems of care resources for children and families. According to the Florida Mental Health Institute, the resource center was also a place for, \\"...public interest , non-profit civic and support groups to hold meetings and conduct organizational activities.\\" Unfortunately, both the Colleen Lunsford Bevis School and Resource Center located on the USF campus has closed, but her legacy still remains. Recently, the Children's Board dedicated a board room in Colleen's honor as well Colleen Lunsford Bevis died on October 11, 2013, at her home in Hillsborough County, Florida.

Early life Ormsby was born in Hampton, Connecticut and became an apprentice in an engraving shop at a young age. In 1829, he attended the National Academy of Design in New York City. Upon graduating he moved to Albany, New York where he engraved over his own name for a few years then to Lancaster, Massachusetts, where he worked for the firm of Carter, Andrews & Co. Eventually, he settled in New York City where he founded the New York Bank Note Company and became one of the founders of the Continental Bank Note Company. He married Julia Ann Brainard in 1830 and they divorced in 1846. Engraving Ormsby was an excellent line engraver and was called upon for a great deal of work for bank notes were in wide use by the Government at the time of the Civil War. He designed the five-dollar note, intended to prevent counterfeiting and was the author of several pamphlets, including, \\"Cycloidal Configurations\\" or the Harvest of Counterfeiture, and a volume on paper-money engraving entitled, \\"A description of the Present System of Bank Note Engraving that was published in 1852. = The Columbian Magazine = Ormsby provided engraving plates for illustrations for The Columbian Magazine', a journal known for printing the stories of Edgar Allan Poe along with political and technological stories, from its first issue. He purchased controlling interest in the magazine in 1847, but readership declined and the magazine eventually failed. Inventions thumbrightThe cylinder of Colt Walker revolver number 1017, held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Ormsby's engraved battle scene can be partially seen Dedicated to stopping counterfeiters, Ormsby invented the ‚Äúgrammagraph\\", a machine used to copy medals and medallions onto bank note dies in order to give the illusion of a bas-relief. The device was later used as a pantographic engraving machine to produce \\"roll-die\\" engraving on metal. The machine automated an existing engraving technique that varied spaces between parallel contour lines to give the impression of depth to a print. In Ormsby's case this was most famously used on the cylinders of revolvers made by Samuel Colt of Colt Firearms. Ormsby produced half a dozen engraving scenes for Colt as early as 1839 and these were featured on models such as the Colt Walker, Colt Dragoon Revolver, Colt Model 1849 Pocket Revolver, Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, and Colt Model 1855 Sidehammer Pocket Revolver. Other inventions by Ormsby included a refined transfer press, medal-ruling machines and geometric lathes that took engraving from human hands to machinery. This was because for the majority of his career he worked alone or with one assistant. Ormsby is said to have helped Samuel Morse in the creation of the Morse alphabet. Later life Ormsby died in Brooklyn, New York, on December 8, 1883. He was the father of Waterman L. Ormsby a reporter for the New York Herald.

In addition, the defendants had weighed up the possibility of carrying out an attack at the Finnish Parliament or at a football match. In interrogations, the defendants admitted to having been inspired by the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013.

From the start, their discussions concerned planning a mass murder. Possible targets included a movie theater, a marathon, the Finnish Parliament House, the Presidential Independence Day Reception and numerous education institutions. The University of Helsinki was chosen as a target in August 2013, because it would be possible to kill many young people there. The accused acquired much equipment suitable for the attack, such as a crossbow, magazines and a large amount of ammunition, combat belts, gas masks and chemicals suitable for creating poisonous arsine gas.Yliopistoiskua suunnitelleet harkitsivat joukkosurmaa my√∂s maratonille tai Linnan juhliin, YLE, 26 May 2014. Accessed on 27 May 2014. The accused had originally discussed carrying out the attack on 20 January 2014. The man had travelled to Helsinki on 15 January, carrying the equipment he had acquired, and stayed with the woman. On 17 January, the two accused people had gone to investigate the University premises, and had studied the premises through the Internet. On the morning of 20 January the man said he wanted to move the attack to a later date. He told the woman that he wanted to plan the attack better and acquire more equipment. The accused had discussed starting the attack by robbing a weapons store near the University. By thus having acquired more weapons, they would have moved straight to the University, where they would have killed people at random. In their discussions, they mentioned locking the exits, setting fire to the building and spreading poison gas. The accused mentioned wanting to die in the attack. Prevention of the attack The accused man contacted a third person via Tor anonymity network on 23 January 2014, who had also written texts concerning mass murder. The accused man asked the third person whether they wanted to take part in the attack. After five days of messaging, it became apparent that the attack was planned to take place on 10 March. The accused man had placed an announcement on the Tor network looking for an accomplice to take part in a \\"massage\\". The man was caught when an undercover police officer replied to the announcement. According to the court, the man had used the word \\"massage\\" because he had confused it with the word \\"massacre\\".Helsingin yliopistolle joukkosurmaa suunnitellut mies halusi syytt√§j√§n mukaan aseita, joilla \\"on helppo l√§hte√§ teurastamaan porukkaa\\" ‚Äì etsi Tor-verkossa kaveria suorittamaan \\"hieronnan\\", MTV Uutiset 4 March 2019.

With the help of contributions of poor and rich citizens of India, a trust was established with the name Mahatma Gandhi National Memorial Trust, for this cause. The Patna Sangrahalaya was established in 1967 near the North-Western corner of Gandhi Maidan. It was a member of the Central Gandhi Sangrahalaya Samiti until July 1971, when the five museums (Ahmadabad, Madurai, Bairakpore, Mumbai, Patna) were made independent. Since then, Gandhi Sangrahalaya, Patna has been an autonomous institution. The museum is located in a quiet place, and contains a Visual Biography of Bapuji containing photos, paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, and quotations; all the major events in his life are told here.

Education Hatfield received her BA in Psychology and English in 1959 from the University of Michigan and her PhD from Stanford University in 1963.  Career  Relationship science was Hatfield's first professional research focus, beginning at the foundation of her career in the 1960s with an emphasis on human attraction and the nature of romantic love. In addition to Berscheid, she has conducted this research with a number of colleagues, including Leon Festinger -- her dissertation advisor at Stanford University--, Elliot Aronson, William Walster, Russell D. Clark, and Susan Sprecher. The \\"Passionate Love Scale\\", developed in 1986 by Hatfield and Sprecher, is one of the most widely used in the field. Hatfield's research in the area has not been without controversy‚Äîin 1975, the $84,000 grant she was awarded by the National Science Foundation became the focus of the first Golden Fleece Award for wasteful government spending by then United States Senator William Proxmire. Due to Proxmire's campaign, the funding was rescinded. Undaunted, Hatfield went on to write or co-write many books and papers based on her research, among them A New Look at Love, which won the American Psychological Foundation's National Media Award, and the often-cited Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality article \\"Gender Differences in Receptivity to Sexual Offers\\" (1989). In the 1990s, Hatfield and husband, American historian Richard Rapson, began researching emotional contagion: the process by which people's emotions are influenced by the demonstrated emotions of their companions. This resulted in the book, with John Caccioppo, on Emotional Contagion. (Cambridge University Press, 1994). In the 2000s, she presented alongside Katherine Aumer on the psychology of hate.. Hatfield is former chair and professor of Psychology at the University of Hawai'i and past-president of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality (SSSS). In 2012, the Association for Psychological Science gave Hatfield the William James award for a Lifetime of Scientific Achievement. In recent years, she has received Distinguished Scientist Awards (for a lifetime of scientific achievement) from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology (SESP), from the SSSS, and from the University of Hawai'i, and she has received the Alfred Kinsey Award from the Western Region of SSSS. Two of her books have won the American Psychological Association's National Media Award.

Its common names include bayberry, southern bayberry, pocosin bayberry, and evergreen bayberry. It sees uses in the garden and for candlemaking, as well as a medicinal plant. Taxonomy This plant is one of several Myrica species that are sometimes split into the genus Morella, e.g. in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System. Additionally M. pensylvanica, which occurs more northerly, and this species are sometimes lumped, disregarding the putative difference that M. pensylvanica is deciduous. M. caroliniensis has several synonyms aside from the Myrica/Morella and M. pensylvanica splits: Myrica heterophylla, Cerothamnus caroliniensis, and Myrica heterophylla var. curtissii. M. caroliniensis is similar to wax myrtle, M. cerifera. These plants' leaves and scent distinguish them: wax myrtle leaves have scent glands on both sides and are fragrant when crushed, bayberry has scent glands mainly on the leaf undersides and is not markedly fragrant. Bayberry and wax myrtle hybridize. Description Myrica caroliniensis is a shrub or small tree adapted to a range of environments from dunes to pocosins, mostly associated with wetlands. In nature, it ranges from Texas to Maryland on the U.S. east coast. It is difficult to distinguish from M. pensylvanica which occurs north to Canada. Myrica caroliniensis is evergreen or tardily deciduous, forming rhizomatous colonies . The glandular leaves are long with a leathery texture and serrated edges. The plant is dioecious, with male and female flowers borne on separate plants. Male flowers have three to five stamens surrounded by short bracts. Female flowers develop into globular drupes surrounded by a waxy coating. The species flowers from spring to early summer, and bears fruit in late summer or fall. Bayberry is an actinorhizal plant: its roots feature nitrogen fixing nodules formed in symbiosis with the nitrogen fixing actinobacteria Frankia. Thus it is tolerant of nitrogen-poor, acidic soils such as wetlands and dunes. The fruit is a source of food for many bird species, including the northern bobwhite quail and the wild turkey. In winter, the seeds are important foods for the Carolina wren and species of tree sparrow. To a point, M. caroliniensis will also provide habitat for the northern bobwhite quail. Birds' digestive systems remove the wax from the fruit, a prerequisite for germination. Uses =Ornamental= Myrica caroliniensis finds use in gardening and horticulture. =Herbalism= Pioneers used the bark of bayberry in dentifrice. Choctaw boiled bayberry and used the result as a treatment for fevers. In 1722, it was reported that colonists in Louisiana drank a mixture of wax and hot water to treat severe dysentery. Bayberry was reported in an account from 1737 as being used to treat convulsions, colic, palsy, and seizures. Starting in the early 19th century, the herbalist Samuel Thomson recommended this plant for producing \\"heat\\" within the body and as a treatment for infectious diseases and diarrhea. That use of bayberry waned later in the 19th century, in favor of using it for a variety of ailments, including a topical use for bleeding gums. For twenty years starting in 1916, bayberry root bark was listed in the American National Formulary. In general, either a decoction or a tincture is used. Infusions and a topical paste have also been used. Pregnant women should not use bayberry. =Candles= Southern bayberry's fruits are a traditional source of the wax for those old-fashioned Christmas decorations called bayberry candles. The wax was extracted by boiling the berries, and skimming off the floating hydrocarbons. The fats were then boiled again and then strained. After that the liquid was usable in candle making, whether through dipping or molding. Southern bayberry is not the only plant usable for making bayberry candles, however. Its close relatives are also usable. Southern bayberry and its relatives have largely been supplanted in candlemaking by substitutes made from paraffin. The substitute candles have artificial colors and aroma compounds that create candles that look and smell similar to natural ones.

It is located about southeast of Kovel on the highway M-19. History Kolodiazhene was first mentioned as an important settlement in the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia since 1199; it was later a part of the Kievan Rus', which it joined in 1220 although the town was thought to have been settled by Vikings in the 900s who usurped the land from indigenous Slavs. The main occupations of the inhabitants were agriculture and animal husbandry. As the town was situated near the growing power of the Kingdom of Poland, the inhabitants of the area fought against the Poles eastern expansion and it is thought that the name Kolodiazhne came from the Polish name for handcuffs which was Kajdany, although this was denied by the inhabitants who endured the attacks, some believed the name came down from Kolodka meaning a small log. Whatever the origins of the name, it stuck. The official date of today's town is listed as 1583, perhaps because of its records having being destroyed over the years. The town was located on a transit route, which is why it was always fought over by various invaders. It is said that Napoleons Grand Army came through the area and at one point in its history it found itself situated right on the Eastern Front during World War 1. The area suffered greatly through both World Wars, especially during World War 2. Notable residents The town's most famous resident was the poet Lesya Ukrainka, who got ideas for, and wrote, some of her poems in the area. Today, there is a museum dedicated to Lesya Ukrainka in the village.

The estate remained the seat of the Aclands until the 17th century, after which it was let to tenants until sold in 1945. Description of house Acland Barton and Chapel were classed as a Grade I listed building in 1965. The house was completely rebuilt in the 15th century, and included its own private domestic chapel, licensed by the Bishop of Exeter. The date 1591 survives carved onto the wooden porch,Pevsner, pp.125‚Äì6 and represents the modernisation and rebuilding of the house at that date involving the insertion into the great hall of a ceiling with room above, thus lowering the height of the house's principal room. This work was done by Hugh Acland (1543‚Äì1622),Acland, p.5 who lived at Acland his whole life.Acland, p.4 The surviving structure is the main range and west wing of the Tudor house. The hall's wooden screen and screens passage survives. The windows of the main range are later alterations. Descent The estate is likely originally to have been named after its first Anglo-Saxon holder named Acca.Acland, p.2, quoting Gover J.E.B. et al, The Place Names of Devon, 1931, p.342 The manor's name signifies \\"Acca's lane\\".Acland, Anne, p.2 Acca \\"once owned a sizeable estate in this district\\",Acland, Anne.

Of which > lineage, five of the first were called Baldwin... In the opinion of Hoskins (1981), the early and repeated use of the Flemish first name of Baldwin, suggests that the Acland family probably migrated to England from Flanders soon after the Norman ConquestAcland, foreword by W. G. Hoskins, pp.xv‚Äìxvi of 1066. The family's historian Anne Acland (Lady Acland, wife of Sir Richard Thomas Dyke Acland, 15th Baronet (1906‚Äì1990)) stated (1981): \\"However the name is spelt, there is no branch of the enormous family which does not stem from the tree which first took root at Acland Barton\\". By the end of the 12th century the Aclands of Acland held an estate of about 400 acres of land. The descent of the estate of Acland as reported by John Acland in the Heraldic Visitation (1531, 1564 or 1620) of Devon was as follows:Vivian, p.3 *Baldwin Eccelin *Baldwin Acalan (son) *William de Acalan (son), who married Sara, daughter and heiress of John de la Pile. *Baldwin de Akelane (son), living in 1320 *John Akelane (son), who married a certain Agneta, of unrecorded family *John Akelane of Akelane (son), who married Alicia Hawkridge, daughter and heiress of William Hawkridge of Hawkridge in the parish of Chittlehampton, Devon, about 4¬Ω miles south-east of Acland.

Eleanor's mother (or step-mother) was Elizabeth Rolle (a daughter of George Rolle (died 1552) of Stevenstone, the founder of a Devonshire land-owning dynasty even greater than the Aclands), who re-married to Sir John Acland (died 1620) of Columb John, Sir Arthur's uncle. Eleanor survived Sir Arthur and remarried to Sir Francis Vincent, 1st Baronet (c. 1568 ‚Äì 1640) of Stoke d'Abernon,Per monumental inscription, Landkey in Surrey. *Sir John Acland, 1st Baronet (c. 1591 ‚Äì 1647) (grandson and heir of Hugh Acland (c. 1543 ‚Äì 1622) and son of Arthur Acland (died 1610), who predeceased his father. He is described in Pole's Description of Devonshire (circa 1635) as \\"ye nowe lord of Akland\\".Pole, p.414 He married his step-sister Elizabeth Vincent (died 1671) and was buried at Stoke D'Abernon. He moved his residence from Acland to Columb John, the former seat of his great-uncle Sir John Acland (died 1620) After this, Acland was retained in the family's ownership and let to tenants, whereupon it became known as Acland Barton. The house served for many generations as a farmhouse, let to tenants by the Acland family, until it was sold in 1945 to the tenant by Sir Richard Thomas Dyke Acland, 15th Baronet (1906‚Äì1990). For the continuing descent of the Acland family see Acland Baronets and Killerton. By the 19th century the family possessed a huge estate in the West Country of almost 40,000 acres, and in the late 20th century it was probably the oldest surviving landed family in Devon. Description in 1726 The \\"Farme of Akelane\\" is the first entry in the 261 pages which comprise the 1726 survey made of the Acland estates by Thomas Nott, steward to Sir Hugh Acland, 6th Baronet (1696‚Äì1728). It was listed under the heading \\"Landkey Parish\\" and was recorded at an annual value of ¬£79, having been leased to Edward Ratclyffe and part to Gregory Davy. The tenant was Samuel Wreford. A note stated:Ravenhill & Rowe, pp.37‚Äì8, Acland Estate survey of 1726 made by Thomas Nott, opening entry > To this farm there belongs an isle (i.e. aisle) in the parish church of > Landkey where many of the ancestors (of) Sr Hugh Acland ly interred, this > isle is repaired by the owner of the farme. Notwithstanding it is charged > with church rates which being thought unreasonable it was contested at law > but given for the parish they proving the ancient usage of the same so that > I suppose the isle was built by some of the family for their own conveniency > and the rates still continued as before but whatever seat there was before > in the church it is now lost. This appears to confirm that the Acland family built the south transept of St Paul's Church, Landkey, in which is situated the Acland Chapel, in which the only surviving monument is that of Arthur Acland (died 1610) of Acland and in which was formerly situated the Acland family pew. This is not to be confused with the private chapel which existed within the former \\"mansion\\"Hoskins, p.422, who uses the term \\"mansion\\" to denote the ancient seats of the Devonshire gentry, rather than as usually a term denoting a grand country house of Acland, licensed by the Bishop of Exeter. Map of 1758 The survey made in 1758 by John Bowring of the Acland family's estates includes an elaborate map (no. XVIII) showing \\"Riverton Manor, Acland Barton, Westcott, East Bathey, West Bathey and a cottage at Newland in the parish of Landkey\\".Ravenhill & Rowe, p.87; Map XVIII held at Devon Record Office, 1148M, add/6/11 It is decorated in the Rococo style with acanthus, field plants, a lamb and winged putto and with scrolls and cornucopia of fruit and flowers.Ravenhill & Rowe, p.87 Notes References Sources *Acland, Anne.

It opened on June 12, 1960 as an extension of Rainbow Caverns Mine Train, which opened on July 2, 1956... It closed on January 2, 1977 to make room for Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. History In 1956, the Rainbow Caverns Mine Train was opened in Frontierland, as part of the Living Desert. Guests boarded a miniature train and were transported through the various scenery of the desert environment, which featured anthropomorphic cacti, the Balancing Rocks which precariously rolled back and forth above the guests, and the beautiful Rainbow Caverns. The Living Desert was also host to other attractions like the Conestoga Wagons, Stagecoaches, and Pack Mules, though the former two disappeared when Nature's Wonderland was introduced. Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland was redesigned by Marc Davis when Walt Disney requested him to insert more humor into Disneyland's attractions. Rainbow Caverns Mine Train was closed and redesigned into Nature's Wonderland, taking inspiration from True-Life Adventures. The scenes of the Living Desert and Rainbow Caverns were incorporated into the redesign, which had guests boarding a train at the fictional Western town Rainbow Ridge before heading off into the attraction. The train traveled through Cascade Peak, Bear Country, Beaver Valley, the Living Desert, Devil's Paint Pots (multicolored geysers), and Rainbow Caverns before returning to the station. The attraction featured over two-hundred replicas of North American animals, and the narrative was provided by Dallas McKennon (who also did voices for some of Walt Disney's feature films and is the voice of Gumby). Due to the rise in popularity for thrill rides, Nature's Wonderland was closed to build a new attraction, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which opened in 1979. However, Big Thunder Mountain is similar to Nature's Wonderland, featuring a runaway train as the ride vehicle, the set of Rainbow Ridge is used as the loading area, and a tribute to Rainbow Caverns exists within the attraction. A surviving locomotive from the ride was part of the scenery on Rivers of America for years, near the former location of Cascade Peak. It was removed in 2010 and sat abandoned in a lot for years until it was moved to the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum in 2014, pending final contracts for donation to the Carolwood Society, but was then returned to Disney when negotiations dragged. The deal was finally signed in 2016, and the group began raising funds to restore the engine. It will be placed on display in a new building next door to the Carolwood barn. An episode of Mickey Mouse titled \\"Nature's Wonderland\\" was released in October 2017, with its story made in homage of the defunct attraction.

(ed). 1982. South African Music Encyclopedia vol. 2, Cape Town, p 170: Oxford University Press. He was head of music and principal conductor at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) and head of music at the University of the Witwatersrand. He became a central figure in art music in South Africa during the mid 20th century. Early life Anton Hartman was the third of six children of a poor family, born at Geduld near Johannesburg in South Africa on 26 October 1918. His father, Stephanus Lionel, a champion marathon runner, was a mine worker and his mother, Maria Barbara Van Amstel, n√©e Van Ryneveld, a piano teacher. She also played piano accompaniments to the silent movies in the 1920s. Hartman first received piano lessons from his mother when he was about seven years old. He made good progress and was soon playing solo piano works and Lieder accompaniments. His elder sisters were also able singers. The family was keen on their long playing records, the predecessors of CDs, listening again and again to a vast collection of music. As a child and teenager Anton Hartman was a loyal member of the Voortrekkers movement which was to become a feature in Afrikaans cultural society. He became a leader in his commando. Their structured activities suited his personality type, one that was also moulded by financial hardship and a fervent will to advance in life. This organisation still exists, focusing as it did on Christian ethics, self-realisation and community service. Hartman obtained the Performer's Licentiate in Piano of the University of South Africa (Unisa) and a BMus degree at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) in 1939, Adolph Hallis being his teacher. Aged 21, Hartman started his career at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in December 1939 and his first position was that of programme compiler of classical music for the Afrikaans service.Malan, J. (ed). 1982. South African Music Encyclopedia vol. 2, Cape Town, p 171: Oxford University Press. Achievements Conducting class. Anton Hartman, Hannes Uys, Albert Coates, Blanche Gerstman, Ernest Fleischmann. (1947) The SABC environment provided many opportunities to acquaint himself with its symphony orchestra: rehearsals, recordings and concerts, many of which were broadcast live and which were the order of the day. Hartman began to realise that, most of all, he wanted to become a conductor. While temporarily transferred to Cape Town in 1947 he took conducting lessons with Albert Coates, sharing these group lessons with Ernest Fleischman, Blanche Gerstman (composer) and Hannes Uys (the father of Tessa and Pieter Dirk Uys).Hartman, M. 2009. Anton Hartman Story Pretoria, p 26: Crink. In 1948 he was appointed part-time conductor of the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra and the West Rand Municipal Orchestra of Krugersdorp, both of which were amateur orchestras. Certificate of attendance of the International Summer Music Academy in Salzburg (1950) In 1944 he married Josina Wilhelmina (Jossie) Boshoff, a singer whom he first met as a secretary at the SABC. Hartman was awarded the Melanie Pollak Scholarship and Union Post Graduate Scholarship which enabled him to study abroad. Having obtained study leave from the SABC, he and Jossie left for Europe in 1949. Vienna became a second home where his conducting teachers included Felix Prohaska (conductor of the Vienna State Opera) and Clemens Krauss for close on two years. His other teachers were Felix Petyrek (composition), Renate Lang (piano) and Oskar Fitz (violin and viola). Jossie's singing teacher was Maria Hittorf. During the summer holidays of 1950 and 1951 Hartman attended the International Summer Academy courses at the Mozarteum in Salzburg with teacher Igor Markevitch, at which he excelled. Markevitch invited the South African to be his assistant at the courses of 1953 and 1955. The latter event saw a very young Daniel Barenboim as one of Hartman's students.Botha, D. (prod.) 1981 Anton Hartman. [Video recording]. Johannesburg: South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). In Salzburg he met Wolfgang Sawallisch who became a lifelong friend. Austria was where his skills, know-how and tastes were refined. He attended many rehearsals and performances conducted by the great names of the time. Karl B√∂hm, Otto Klemperer, Erich Kleiber, Rafael Kubelik, Rudolf Moralt, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Hans Knappertsbusch and Herbert von Karajan were on his list of admired maestri, whereas he found Leopold Stokowski's theatrical mannerisms outrageous. Upon his return to South Africa late in 1951 Hartman was appointed assistant conductor at the SABC, alongside Jeremy Schulman and Edgar Cree. His first live broadcast with the SABC Orchestra was on 15 November 1951, Beethoven's Third Symphony (the Eroica) being presented as the main work on the programme. Renowned visiting American pianist Andor Foldes performed with the SABC under his baton in 1953. Hartman added his voice to the plea for a bigger symphony orchestra which could perform and broadcast a wider range of music. This became a reality in 1954 when the orchestra amalgamated with the Johannesburg City Orchestra. Career The Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge (FAK), translated Federation of Afrikaans cultural societies, was founded in 1929. Hartman had already served on the dynamic music committee of the FAK since 1944. In 1955 he was appointed head of this committee,FAK (Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge) 1955.

Over the following decades Hartman and his committee made significant strides in producing popular Afrikaans song books, presenting courses for school music, arranging competitions for choirs and awarding bursaries for deserving musicians.Hartman, M. 2009. Anton Hartman Story Pretoria, p 96: Crink. Hartman meets Igor Stravinsky at the Johannesburg international airport (1962) In 1960 Hartman was appointed head of music at the SABC, a newly created position. This resulted in a scaling down of his conducting load and his being sent to Europe to investigate management models and recruit orchestra players. It was the first of a number of such visits to Europe. Upon his return home he initiated more projects for light music as well as ethnic Afrikaans music (Boeremusiek). For the former projects international artists Mantovani and Jos Cleber were involved.Van den Berg, R.J. 1976. Die musiekaktiwiteite van die SAUK 1936 ‚Äì 1966, p 197. Potchefstroom: Masters thesis North West University. The next two decades Hartman‚Äôs career at the SABC saw him becoming principal conductor in 1964 and later head of music again in 1967 until 1977. He was a long time friend and associate of Hans Adler (Chairman of the Johannesburg Musical Society, and well known for his keyboard instrument collection and extensive library, later willed to Witwatersrand University, where Hartman had just earlier become head of music) and their co-operation led to many years of concerts and SABC recordings by the finest overseas musicians. Classical musicians who accepted invitations by the SABC to perform or conduct in South Africa in the sixties and seventies included Radu Aldulescu, Henk Badings, Michel Block, Erling Blondell-Bengtsson, Jorge Bolet, Alfred Brendel, Frederick Brenn, Pierre Boulez, Alfredo Campoli, Edgar Cosma, Robert Craft, Marina de Gabar√°in, Monique de la Bruchollerie, Antal Dorati, Phillipe Entremont, Christian Ferras, Arthur Fiedler, Pierre Fournier, Josef Friedland, Erick Friedman, Pierino Gamba, Leonce Gras, Monique Haas, Piet Halsema, Jascha Horenstein, Mindru Katz, Gerald Krug, Louis Lane, Franco Mannino, Dennis Matthews, Ivan Melman, Hans Mommer, Andre Navarra, Rafael Orozco, Franco Patone, Gyorgy Pauk, Edith Peinemann, John Pritchard, Ruggiero Ricci, Witold Rowicki, Malcolm Sargent, Bela Siki, Constantin Silvestri, Abbey Simon, Ruth Slenczynska, Maria Stader, Janos Starker, Daniel Sternefeld, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Igor Stravinsky, Henryk Szering, Bryden Thomas, Sergio Varella- Cid, Tibor Varga, Tamas Vas√†ry, Heinz Wallberg, Ernst Wallfisch, Daniel Wayenberg, Kurt W√∂ss, Narciso Yepes Van den Berg, R.J. 1976.

Hartman was also committed to presenting South African musicians in SABC broadcasts. Instrumentalists and vocalists were traced through auditions and offered contracts. South African composers were commissioned to compose for broadcasting and be 'discovered'.Van den Berg, R.J. 1976. Die musiekaktiwiteite van die SAUK 1936 ‚Äì 1966, p 57. Potchefstroom: Masters thesis North West University. Stefans Grov√©, Arnold van Wyk, Hubert du Plessis, Roelof Temmingh and Peter Klatzow featured in this group. His passionate desire to involve the youth in art music flowered into the founding of the South African National Youth Orchestra, in association with the South African Society of Music Teachers. The SABC also had its own Junior Orchestra. The inception in 1970 of the SABC Music Prize for young local performers who wished to pursue a solo career was another brain-child of Hartman‚Äôs. As a result of Hartman‚Äôs establishing of the Opera Society of South Africa (OPSA) in 1957, opera productions in Afrikaans increased and local singers performed and shone in their roles. Operas and oratorios were translated into Afrikaans by Hartman himself together with his colleagues. The SABC Orchestra visited local cities, rural towns and neighbouring countries, Mozambique and South West Africa (today Namibia) to introduce audiences to the genre. Orchestras in Salisbury (today Harare) and Bulawayo in Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe) were conducted by Hartman in 1971, 1973 and 1976.Hartman, M. 2009. Anton Hartman Story Pretoria, p 158: Crink. During the 70th anniversary celebrations of the city of Johannesburg in 1956 the London Symphony Orchestra visited the 'City of Gold' and Hartman conducted one of the performances. From left: Hartman, Graham Newcater, Walter Mony Hartman was invited to conduct in Europe, in many instances being the first South African to do so. In 1953 he conducted the orchestra at the opening concert at the International Summer Academy in Salzburg. A performance with the radio symphony orchestra of Vienna followed in 1955, as well as with the radio symphony orchestra of the North West German radio in Hamburg in the same year. A recording of works by South Africans John Joubert and Arnold van Wyk was made by the latter orchestra. In 1964 he conducted three concerts in Brussels, Belgium, that were recorded and later broadcast. In August 1966 Hartman was on the outdoor podium with the orchestra of Santa Cecilia in the Forum Romanum in Rome, Italy. More invitations to Italy followed when Hartman was selected as jury member for the Radio Italia Prix in 1969, 1972, and 1976.Hartman, M. 2009. Anton Hartman Story Pretoria, p 148: Crink.

In 1968 he served on the board of the newly established Rand Afrikaans University (today the University of Johannesburg). The University of Stellenbosch awarded Hartman an honorary degree DMus in 1968 and his alma mater awarded Hartman an honorary degree DMus in 1975.Malan, J. (ed). 1982.

Anton Hartman Story Pretoria, p 147: Crink. In 1978 Hartman left the SABC to take up the post of head of music at the University of the Witwatersrand. Anton Nel was the top piano student there at the time and later pursued an international career as pedagogue and concert pianist.Hartman, M. 2009. Anton Hartman Story Pretoria, p 182: Crink. Hartman sought insight into the running of academic music departments and drawing up syllabi. For this purpose he visited eleven institutions in the USA, including the Curtis Institute of Music, Eastman School of Music, Oberlin College in Ohio, Cleveland Institute of Music, Akron (university and symphony orchestra), North Carolina School of Arts, Florida State University and the Juilliard School of Music in January 1980. Personalities interviewed by Hartman included John de Lancie, Clayton Krehbiel, Louis Lane (a personal friend) and Dorothy Delay. Delay accepted the invitation to visit South Africa the following year to present master classes. New music courses were subsequently introduced at Wits. Throughout the years numerous articles by Hartman were published in books and journals, including 'History of the music of the Afrikaner'.Nel, P.G. (ed). 1979. Die kultuurontplooiing van die Afrikaner, p 334-348. Pretoria, Cape Town: Tafelberg. The South African State Theatre in Pretoria was inaugurated in May 1981. Hartman conducted one of the gala concerts with soloists Mimi Coertse, Evelyn Dalberg, Bernard de Clerk and Deon Van der Walt. Hartman was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer in that year and died on 3 February 1982. The cultural agenda of Afrikaner nationalism Afrikaner nationalism was aimed at countering British imperialism in South Africa. It originated in the late 19th century and reached its zenith by about 1975.Giliomee, H. 2012. Afrikanernasionalisme, 1875‚Äì1899, p 219. In: Pretorius, F. (ed.) Geskiedenis van Suid-Afrika. Cape Town: Tafelberg. Afrikaans, the young language of a very diverse group of people, was the primary (but not exclusive) asset of Afrikaner nationalism. Tangible until at least the mid 20th century, British imperialism evaporated as Afrikaner nationalism and black nationalism took over. Afrikaner nationalism flourished in the organisations that sprouted from it. The Afrikaner Broederbond (AB, founded in 1918) was one such organisation. In English this can be translated to Brotherhood. It was a 'secret' and powerful Afrikaner men's society that exerted its influence in many spheres.Hartman, M. 2009. Anton Hartman Story, p 67. Pretoria: Crink. Broederbonders who became prominent in the South African landscape included the industrialist Anton Rupert, poet and playwright N.P. van Wyk Louw,Dommisse, E. and Esterhuyse, W. 2008.

Cape Town: Media 24 According to his diary Hartman, aged 33, was invited to join the AB on 29 February 1952. As a mother tongue Afrikaans speaker and deeply aware of his fellow Afrikaners‚Äô perceived or real educational, cultural and economic inferiority he accepted this invitation. When he was a young employee at the SABC carefully selecting records to play on the air, he was already harnessing the uplifting that beautiful music could bring to very ordinary people in the remote rural areas of the expansive sub continent. By the time he was head of music or the principal conductor of the SABC he could build the biggest philharmonic orchestra south of the Sahara to a formidable entity. He also insisted on exposing South African audiences to art music of the 20th century.

The Pistol Pete mascot costume features traditional cowboy attire and a headpiece resembling Frank Eaton. Pistol Pete has been the mascot for the Oklahoma State Cowboys since 1923.Oklahoma State University Archived Content History Pistol Pete, mascot of the Oklahoma A&M; Aggies Pistol Pete, mascot of the Oklahoma State Cowboys From the 1890s on, Oklahoma A&M; sports teams had been referred to as the Agriculturists or Aggies, the Farmers, and officially but unpopularly, the Tigers. By 1924 Charles Saulsberry, sports editor of the Oklahoma City Times, and other writers who regularly covered college events had begun to refer to Stillwater's teams as the A&M; Cowboys. The Athletic Council authorized Athletic Director Edward C. Gallagher to have 2,000 balloons printed, \\"Oklahoma Aggies - Ride 'Em Cowboy\\" for sale at football games in 1926. Around 1923, when Oklahoma A&M; College was searching for a new mascot to replace their tiger (which had been copied from Princeton and accounts for the orange and black school colors), a group of students saw Frank Eaton leading Stillwater's Armistice Day Parade. He was approached to see if he would be interested in being the model for the new mascot, and he agreed. A likeness was drawn and began to be used on sweatshirts, stickers, etc. and a tradition was born. That caricature was the basis for what is used today as the official Oklahoma State University mascot. For thirty-five years, the crusty old cowboy was a living symbol of OSU, representing the colorful past of the area. As such, he would attend OSU athletic events, building dedications, etc., and sign autographs, pose for photographs and reminisce about the American Old West with anyone who would listen. In more recent years, the University of Wyoming and New Mexico State University began using variations of OSU's artwork as logos for their schools. To this day, his likeness is a visible reminder of the Old West to literally millions of people yearly as a symbol of colleges whose mascots pay homage to the cowboy. However, it was not until 1958 that \\"Pistol Pete\\" was adopted as the school's mascot. The familiar caricature of \\"Pistol Pete\\" was officially sanctioned in 1984 by Oklahoma State University as a licensed symbol. Each year, an average of 15 Oklahoma State students audition to portray Pistol Pete. A panel of former \\"Petes\\" conduct the tryouts and select two replacements based largely on an interview. Candidates are also asked to exhibit themselves as they would during in-game scenarios. The two students chosen share around 650 appearances per year, which includes all OSU Cowboy and Cowgirl athletic events, though Pistol Pete has also assumed a significant role as an ambassador and symbol for Oklahoma State University at large. As such, Pistol Pete is often asked to make appearances in parades, community festivals, corporate functions, weddings and birthday parties. President Thep Phongparnich of Thailand's Maejo University received Oklahoma State's Distinguished International Alumni Award on November 12, 2005, following which his university also adopted Pistol Pete as a mascot.Distinguished International Alumni Award See also *Oklahoma State Cowboys and Cowgirls References External links *Pistol Pete at Oklahoma State University *Pistol Pete Interview Series - Oklahoma Oral History Research Program *Frank Eaton at OSU's Special Collections and University Archives Category:Big 12 Conference mascots Category:Oklahoma State Cowboys and Cowgirls ","title":"Pistol Pete (Oklahoma State University)"},{"id":"42889245","text":"Newman Centre is the Roman Catholic university chaplaincy for the University of Toronto.

It is under the direction of the Archdiocese of Toronto and is associated with the neighbouring St. Thomas Aquinas Parish Church. Site history =Construction= The structure was built in 1890-1891 by the Canadian businessman \\"The Barley King of Canada\\" Wilmot Deloui Matthews. It is constructed of red clay, terra-cotta bricks, plum-coloured Credit Valley sandstone and pressed terra-cotta decorative elements. In 1899, to celebrate his daughter‚Äôs wedding, Matthews hired architect George M. Miller and sculptor Gustav Hahn to design an Art Nouveau ballroom in the house. In 1900, a larger kitchen was added. Later expansions would see an upper floor and basement being converted to create more living space. Originally, there was a coach house adjacent to it. The coach house was later replaced by St. Thomas Aquinas Church.Our History from NewmanToronto.com, retrieved 28 May 2014 =Purchase= In 1919, Matthews died. In 1922, the house was sold to the Newman Foundation. The Newman Foundation was a body created to purchase a suitable site for the local Newman Club. The Newman Club's purpose is to support Roman Catholic students in secular universities. The Newman Foundation was able to raise the necessary funds because of donations from two major benefactors, one of whom was Frank Patrick O'Connor. This allowed the foundation to purchase the property for the sum of $100,000. The Newman Centre is one of city's preserved examples of Romanesque Revival architecture. In 1977, it became one of the first buildings in Toronto to receive heritage status from the Ontario Heritage Trust. The cost of maintenance is met by the Archdiocese of Toronto. The site has been used for filming, including scenes from Spotlight, Suits, The Odd Squad and Storage Wars. Ministry The students that live in the centre are known as Student Campus Ministers. This role was established by Fr. Thomas Rosica CSB in 1994. Until Fr Rosica's departure in 2000, the chaplaincy was administered by the Congregation of St. Basil. Originally, from 1913 to 1936 it was run by the Paulist Fathers. In 2000, the Basilians handed it over to the archdiocese who continue to serve the centre and parish.

Crowdfunding The An Intimate History of the Greater Kingdom series was funded entirely by its audience. Miranda began writing this series in 2007. She posted the first draft in serial form on the internet in 2008. It was a success; at one point in 2008, 2000 people were reading it per day. She realized the series was not sustainable in serial form in 2009. So she took it down, and solicited support from her fans to make the series into a novel.

These are two of the fundamental elements in circuit theory. Real electrical generators are most commonly modelled as a non-ideal source consisting of a combination of an ideal source and a resistor. Voltage generators are modelled as an ideal voltage source in series with a resistor. Current generators are modelled as an ideal current source in parallel with a resistor. The resistor is referred to as the internal resistance of the source. Real world equipment may not perfectly follow these models, especially at extremes of loading (both high and low) but for most purposes they suffice. The two models of non-ideal generators are interchangeable, either can be used for any given generator. Th√©venin's theorem allows a non-ideal current source model to be converted to a non-ideal voltage source model and Norton's theorem allows a non-ideal voltage source model to be converted to a non-ideal current source model. Both models are equally valid, but the voltage source model is more applicable to when the internal resistance is low (that is, much lower than the load impedance) and the current source model is more applicable when the internal resistance is high (compared to the load).

Symbols do vary from region to region and time period to time period. Another common symbol for a current source is two interlocking circles. Dependent sources A dependent source is one in which the voltage or current of the source output is dependent on another voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit. There are thus four possible types: current dependent voltage source, voltage dependent voltage source, current dependent current source and voltage dependent current source. Non-ideal dependent sources can be modelled with the addition of an impedance in the same way as non-dependent sources. These elements are widely used to model the function of two-port networks; one generator is needed for each port and it is dependent on either voltage or current at the other port. The models are an example of black box modelling, that is, they are quite unrelated to what is physically inside the device but correctly model the device's function. There are a number of these two-port models, differing only in the type of generator required to represent them. This kind of model is particularly useful for modelling the behaviour of transistors. Dependent sources used to represent a two-port network in h-parameters The model used to represent h-parameters is shown in the figure. h-parameters are frequently used in transistor data sheets to specify the device. The h-parameters are defined as the matrix : \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_1  I_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} h_{11} & h_{12}  h_{21} & h_{22} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I_1  V_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} where the voltage and current variables are as shown in the figure. The circuit model using dependent generators is just an alternative way of representing this matrix.

Services Viapath provides pathology services to Bedford Hospital NHS Trust and the Princess Royal University Hospital as well as to Guy's, St Thomas‚Äô and King's College hospitals, delivering tests across 20 major pathology services, from clinical transplantation to biochemical genetics and biochemical sciences. More than 1,000 scientists support these services, providing over 20,000 individual pathology tests. The laboratories are either accredited with or working towards the ISO 15189 medical laboratory standard and are listed by UKAS. The cancer diagnostics hub has an extensive range of tests and the Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Centre offers a comprehensive, state of the art clinical and diagnostic service. Taking on the recommendations of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on cancer services, it offers a multidisciplinary service to diagnose and monitor haematological cancers. This includes immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, molecular haemato-oncology and histology providing a high- volume, rapid turn-around, integrated diagnostic facility in a single pathology laboratory site. The genetics laboratories are supporting the UK‚Äôs ground-breaking 100,000 Genomes Project, which is set to improve the lives of countless patients with cancer and rare diseases by sequencing 100,000 whole genomes from around 70,000 NHS patients with rare diseases or cancer. Viapath has instigated many research projects some of which have resulted in the development of new tests with sustainable clinical benefits. One such project aims to revolutionise the field of pathogen identification and anti-microbial susceptibility. It will improve early management of sepsis, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use to combat antimicrobial resistance, and identify rare but serious pandemic infectious diseases threats, both known and emerging. The goal is to provide same-day microbiological identification and anti-microbial susceptibility, which until now has been an enigma. A Newborn Screening project enabled the linking of newborn and antenatal screening results, improving the robustness, flexibility and scalability of Viapath‚Äôs NHS service which is a benefit to patient lives. Viapath has an Innovation Fund from which scientists are invited to apply for funding to develop new tests which then progress to new services that support patient care. In 2018 Viapath Nutris, a pathology-to-patient service providing access to tests which are focusing initially on vitamin deficiency, was introduced. There are around 120,000 people in the UK who are B12 deficient, with vegans, vegetarians and patients with pernicious anaemia most vulnerable and waiting for a B12 deficiency diagnosis, risks neurological damage and cognitive decline. The online service provides direct access to tests that help patients to identify their B12 status and manage it. History Viapath was established under the name of GSTS Pathology in 2009 as a partnership with Serco. It was founded in response to the recommendations in the ‚ÄúReport of the Review of NHS Pathology Services in England‚Äù chaired by Lord Carter of Coles, published in 2006. GSTS Pathology posted a ¬£5.9 million loss in 2011 but a ¬£3.8m net profit for the year ending December 2013, up from ¬£300,000 in 2012. Income increased by 6% from ¬£87.6m in 2012 to ¬£92.5m in 2013. In 2014 the majority-owned NHS joint venture rebranded itself Viapath when it merged with Kingspath. In January 2014, Viapath began operating as three different entities: Viapath Group, Viapath Analytics and Viapath Services. Viapath Group ‚Äì enables the provision of an end to end pathology service including laboratory testing services, laboratory facilities and equipment, logistics, IT and corporate support services. Viapath Analytics ‚Äì enables the provision of laboratory testing services across the full range of core and reference pathology services including Blood Sciences, Histopathology & Cytology, Microbiology, Molecular Pathology and Genetics. Viapath Services ‚Äì enables the provision of fully managed laboratory services including equipment, consumables, facilities, stock, logistics and IT to support laboratory testing across all pathology disciplines. The company awarded a contract to Cerner for its PathNet pathology system in May 2014. The company increased its income by 5% to ¬£97.1m in 2014 compared to the previous year. Profit however dipped very slightly from ¬£3.8m to ¬£3.7m over the same period. In February 2016, Dr David Bennett, former head of NHS Foundation Trust regulator Monitor, was appointed the new Chair of Viapath. In July 2016, Dr Dominic Harrington won the ‚ÄòAcademy for Healthcare Science award for innovation‚Äô at the Advancing Healthcare Awards. He was recognised for his achievement in creating Viapath‚Äôs Innovation Academy. The Innovation Academy is a peer-to-peer platform for innovation and was formed to encourage networking in order to advance pathology services and communicate developments in pathology. Over 100 delegates attended the inaugural symposium, which included presentations on subjects such as Child Health, Infectious Diseases and Next Generation Diagnostics. In 2016, response to the Government‚Äôs new Apprenticeship Levy scheme, Viapath partnered with 3aaa Apprenticeships to train apprentices under Viapath‚Äôs new VIAcademy scheme. In 2018, in conjunction with the Academy of Healthcare Science, the ‚ÄúViapath Award For Innovation In Healthcare Science‚Äù was created, a category that was open to all UK healthcare scientists. The winners were Jonathan Ashmore and Cormac McGrath, clinical scientists from NHS Highlands and Belfast Health and Social Care Trust for their work on developing a free app which allows children to experience their upcoming MRI in virtual reality, helping them to understand and prepare for what is often a difficult and scary experience. Following successful trials, in 2018, Viapath agreed to implement diagnostics.ai's unique artificial intelligence (AI) technology into Viapath's South London Specialist Virology Centre at King's College Hospital. This technology automates the analysis and reporting of results. The innovative system removes manual steps, delivering a digitised and paperless system (tying into the NHS Five Year Forward View- Paperless 2020), as well as enabling faster turnaround, reduced risk and improved laboratory capacity. When the company lost its bid for a renewal of the 15 year contract the trusts bought our Serco's share. NHS overcharging Internal documents leaked to Corporate Watch in August 2014 indicate that the company overcharged the NHS for diagnostic tests. A 2013 internal audit by Guy's into three of the 15 laboratories run by Viapath found its invoicing and billing systems were ‚Äúunreliable‚Äù and contained ‚Äúmaterial inaccuracies‚Äù, amounting to an overcharge of ¬£283,561 over a sample three-month period. A variety of complaints by clinicians were recorded, centering on a policy of employing staff who were less experienced and less expensive. In a review of its first four years, marked ‚Äústrictly confidential‚Äù, Chief Executive Richard Jones admitted that it had ‚Äúachieved much less than hoped‚Äù and that ‚Äúinitial attempts at transformation were badly handled and ended up costing money rather than saving it‚Äù.

In 1916, he graduated from Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. With the United States' entry into World War I, Vaughan was commissioned second lieutenant in the Field Artillery and was assigned for military training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. During the training, Vaughan befriended another officer, future U.S. President Harry S. Truman. They were both assigned to the 129th Field Artillery Regiment within the 35th Division and sent to France. Vaughan participated in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel or the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He served as a liaison officer and battery commander, and for his service in combat, he was later decorated with two Silver Stars and the French Croix de Guerre. Vaughan returned to active duty in World War II, was injured in a plane crash in 1943, and was assigned to the staff of the Truman Committee. Truman made him the first Vice Presidential military aide in 1945; he continued as military aide to the president when Truman succeeded Franklin D. Roosevelt, and remained in the post until the end of Truman's presidency in 1953. In the 1950s, Vaughan was accused of bribery. In 1951, White House Appointments Secretary Matthew J.

Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case examining whether a federal court has jurisdiction over activity that violates the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act but takes place off Indian lands, and, if so, whether tribal sovereign immunity prevents a state from suing in federal court.The Oyez Project: Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community In a 5-4 decision, the Court held that the State of Michigan's suit against Bay Mills is barred by tribal immunity.. Background In 1988, Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) to establish the jurisdictional framework which governs Indian gaming and created three classes of gaming. Class III gaming, which is the most highly regulated and the class involved in this case, includes casino gaming, horse racing, and slot machines. A tribe may conduct gaming operations pursuant to a compact entered into with a state.Michigan Gaming Control Board: Tribal-State Compacts IGRA allows a state to bring a suit against a tribe for certain compact violations, including gaming on Indian lands in violation of an effective compact.25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii) The compact between Michigan and the Bay Mills Indian Community was approved by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs on November 19, 1993 and the tribe operated gaming in the Upper Peninsula.A Compact Between the Bay Mills Indian Community and the State of Michigan Providing for the Conduct of Tribal Class III Gaming by the Bay Mills Indian Community In 2010, using accrued interest from federal appropriations,Michigan Indian Land Claims Settlement Act, 111 Stat. 2652 the tribe purchased land near Vanderbilt, in the Lower Peninsula, and claimed authority to operate a casino there. The state filed suit in federal court and the Interior Department opined that the use of the land trust funds to purchase the land did not convert it to Indian territory. The court enjoined the tribe against opening a casino. The Sixth Circuit vacated the injunction holding that tribal immunity barred Michigan's suit against Bay Mills unless Congress provided otherwise. Supreme Court The case was argued before the Court on December 2, 2013. John J. Bursch, then the Michigan Solicitor General, argued for the petitioner, and Neal Kumar Katyal argued for the respondent. Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler argued for the United States as amicus curiae. =Opinion and Concurrence= Justice Elena Kagan delivered the Opinion of the Court affirming the decision of the Sixth Circuit. The majority included Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Kennedy, Breyer, and Sotomayor. Justice Kagan begins by exploring the concept of Indian tribes being \\"domestic dependent nations\\" exercising \\"inherent sovereign authority\\" subject to the plenary authority of Congress. Quoting the Court's ruling in Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, Kagan notes that tribes enjoy immunity from suits which are traditionally enjoyed by other sovereign powers which is a \\"necessary corollary to Indian sovereignty and self-governance.\\" Kagan goes on to explain why the IGRA does not apply here, citing its provision that a state may bring suit to enjoin tribal gaming on Indian lands in violation of an effective compact, but may not do so off Indian lands, which applies to the Vanderbilt property. While Michigan argued that the Court should \\"correct\\" this anomaly, it declines to do so. The opinion points out that Michigan could utilize its own statutory provisions and procedures to take action which may be in violation of state law (such as denying a license to Bay Mills for an off-reservation casino, and bringing suit against the tribe if it went ahead anyway). The opinion concludes by relying on the doctrine of stare decisis, relying on and citing its prior decision in Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc. (1998), reaffirms that the \\"doctrine of tribal immunity is settled law and controls this case.\\" It is ultimately Congress' job \\"to determine whether or how to limit tribal immunity\\" and \\"[t]he special brand of sovereignty the tribes retain...rests in the hands of Congress.\\" Justice Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion detailing why history and courtesy advise against limiting tribal sovereign immunity. Indian tribes existed before the United States as \\"self-governing sovereign political communities,\\" and \\"have not given up their full sovereignty\\"United States v. Wheeler, . they retain their sovereignty and powers absent congressional acts to the contrary. She cites Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), in which the Court ruled that tribes are not foreign states and that \\"[t]he condition of the Indians in relation to the United States is perhaps unlike that of any other two people in existence\\",. concluding that 200 years of jurisprudence are against treating the tribes like foreign visitors in United States courts. =Dissents= Justice Scalia filed a dissent contending that the Court's ruling in Kiowa was wrongly decided and that \\"stare decisis does not recommend its retention.\\" Justice Thomas, joined by Justices Scalia, Ginsburg, and Alito, additionally contends that Kiowa was \\"error,\\" and that \\"[s]uch an expansion of tribal immunity is unsupported by any rational basis for that doctrine, inconsistent with the limits on tribal sovereignty, and an affront to state sovereignty.\\" He further argues that the immunity a tribe may claim in court is because the law provides it, not because it is inherently entitled to it as a sovereign, later citing Kiowa that the Court \\"has taken the lead in drawing the bounds of tribal immunity\\" and that any asserted deference to Congress \\"was a fiction and remains an enigma.\\" Thomas goes on to assert that stare decisis may sometimes be \\"the preferred course,\\" but it is \\"not an inexorable command.\\" Because of the increase in commercial activity undertaken by tribes, and, thus, the limitation and even extinguishing of states' \\"ability to protect their citizens and enforce the law against tribal businesses,\\" Thomas argues that stare decisis is inappropriate in this case. Justice Ginsburg dissented on the basis that no brand of \\"immoderate, judicially confirmed immunity...will have staying power.\\" References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:Legal history of Michigan Category:United States Native American case law Category:2014 in United States case law ","title":"Michigan v.

The story follows Steve Van Ruyle (Robert Preston) and Kit Lane (Ellen Drew) as they investigate the apparent murder of Lane's boss, in an attempt to clear her as a suspect. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer optioned the film rights to the play in 1934 and hired Rand to work on the screenplay, but they did not move forward and the option lapsed. The rights were later resold, first to RKO Pictures, then to Paramount Pictures. Paramount brought in a new team of writers, and Rand played no role in the final production. Plot Steve Van Ruyle (Robert Preston) is a sailor who inherits a position on the board of a company headed by Bjorn Faulkner (Nils Asther). The board discovers $20 million has disappeared from the company's funds, and demands answers from Faulkner. That night Faulkner meets with a man called Anton Haraba, and is apparently thrown from his penthouse balcony to his death. Faulkner's secretary, Kit Lane (Ellen Drew), enters the penthouse moments later, leading police to arrest her for Faulkner's murder. Van Ruyle decides to investigate the crime. Suspecting that Lane and Faulkner were embezzling the money together, he pays her bail so he can question her about the situation. They find Faulkner's diary, and the entries lead Van Ruyle to believe Lane is innocent. The district attorney (Paul Stanton) disagrees, and Lane goes to trial. Van Ruyle attempts to prove Lane's innocence with fake evidence, but his ruse is discovered. The two flee with evidence from Faulkner's apartment, which they use to track down the mysterious Haraba. They trace him to a hotel in Havana, Cuba, where they discover that \\"Haraba\\" is a pseudonym being used by Faulkner, who has faked his own death. When Faulkner takes Lane captive, Van Ruyle rushes with police to Faulkner's room to rescue her. Faulkner is arrested, and Van Ruyle and Lane decide to get married.

The movie rights to the play were initially purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in October 1934 as a possible vehicle for Loretta Young. They hired Rand to write a screenplay, but the project was scrapped. After MGM's option expired, Al Woods, who was producing the play on Broadway, considered making a movie version through a production company of his own. Instead, in 1938 RKO Pictures bought the rights for $10,000, a fee split between Woods and Rand. RKO looked at Claudette Colbert and Lucille Ball as possibilities to star, but they also gave up on the adaptation. The rights were resold to Paramount Pictures in July 1939 for $35,000. Rand did not participate in the production at Paramount. Three other writers (Delmer Daves, Robert Pirosh, and Eve Greene) were brought in to prepare a new screenplay. Paramount planned for the film to star Barbara Stanwyck and Don Ameche, who was to be loaned out by 20th Century Fox, where he was on contract. Ameche refused to take the part, which delayed the start of the production, causing Stanwyck to drop out. As a result, Ameche was suspended for two weeks by 20th Century Fox and sued by Paramount for $170,000 in damages. Paramount considered Paulette Goddard and Ray Milland for the roles before finally casting Drew and Asther. The production used the working titles Private Secretary and Secrets of a Secretary, but the movie was released in 1941 as The Night of January 16th, following the title of the play. The play took place entirely in a courtroom, and its best-known feature was that it used a jury selected from members of the audience, who would decide the defendant's guilt or innocence at the end. This feature was impossible to reproduce in a movie, so the new screenplay altered the plot significantly, focusing on Steve Van Ruyle, a character that did not exist in the play. Unlike the play where Faulkner is already dead, in the movie he appears as a living character who is then apparently murdered. The name of the prime suspect, Faulkner's assistant, was changed from Karen Andre to Kit Lane, and the action is not focused on the courtroom. Rand claimed only a single line from her original dialog appeared in the movie, which she dismissed as a \\"cheap, trashy vulgarity\\". Reception The film received little attention when it was released, and most of the reviews were negative. A review in Variety praised Drew's performance, but described the direction as \\"heavyhanded\\" and the plot as involving \\"an unbelievable set of coincidences\\".

Nevertheless, most of her medals were obtained in Central American and Caribbean Games. After winning five consecutive gold medals at the 1986 edition hosted in Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, she was awarded the 1986 National Sports Prize of Mexico. Life after retirement After retiring from international competitions, Bret√≥n coached Olympic medalists A√≠da Rom√°n and Mariana Avitia (Google translation) and briefly worked as sports commentator for Televisa Deportes during the 2012 Summer Olympics. Controversially, she also served as president of the Mexican Archery Federation (in ), where she was involved in two major scandals that forced her resignation. In the first incident, the father of an underage female athlete accused her of molesting his daughter on 2 May 2004 during an international competition in France. According to the claimant, the travel expenses of the minor had been paid in advance by a state government, but Bret√≥n booked a single room for both alleging budget cuts and, reportedly, asked an accompanying female athlete (with no prior knowledge of the local language nor acquainted with the city) to search for and bring back something to eat at the hotel while she sexually harassed his daughter. A year later, on October 2005, Bret√≥n was caught by immigration authorities of the United States while trying to secure travel visas for two deli vendors and a friend of her own daughter by presenting them as official coaches of the Mexican archery team. The United States Embassy in Mexico City intervened and she was charged with visa fraud and banned from visiting the country for ninety-nine years. Following the incident, she was asked to resign from all executive posts in both the federation and the Mexican Sports Confederation (Codeme). Bret√≥n died at the age of 64 from a chronic degenerative disease on 27 May 2014, at the ISSSTE General Hospital in Tacuba, a northeastern borough of Mexico City. Her remains, however, were moved by her family to the central state of Hidalgo.

The songwriting is credited to Ray Davies. On one of the earliest covers of the album (CVPV 76032.30), the song is credited R.Davies - D.Davies. Background On every release of \\"Party Line\\", the song is said to be written by Ray Davies, the main songwriter of The Kinks. However, in his critically acclaimed autobiography Kink, Dave Davies (who also sang \\"Party Line\\") claimed that he had written the song rather than Ray. Dave Davies has said, \\"On 'Party Line' I got really stuck for lyrics; I just didn't know what to write. And Ray and I got together and busted out a few things on the piano and got a lot of ideas for it. So he heiped me with the lyrics on that.\\" However, Rob Jovanovic, author of God Save The Kinks: A Biography, wrote that \\"Party Line\\" was co-written between both Davies brothers. The opening of the track (a man answering a telephone) is a remnant from the early stages of the Face to Face album, where the songs were to be linked by sound effects (other songs, such as \\"Holiday in Waikiki\\" and \\"Rainy Day in June\\", also have these sound effects). The man answering the phone in the sound effect is Grenville Collins, one of the band's managers at the time. Lyrics and music The lyrics of \\"Party Line\\", the singer complains about being on a party line, with lyrics like \\"I can't speak without an interception / This is private, please get off my line / Please tell me when I can have my privacy / I'd like to meet the girl who's always talking / when I'm speaking on my party line\\". He says that he's \\"wonderin' all the time who's on the other end,\\" and asking himself, \\"Is she big, is she small? Is she a she at all? Who's on my party line?\\" He goes on to say, \\"Wish I had a more direct connection / This party line was here when I arrived / And I'm not voting in the next election / If they don't do something about finding out / The person who is on my party line\\". The track opens with a sound effect of a telephone ringing and being answered. Unusually for the band, the lead vocals are done by Dave Davies, rather than Ray.

Personal life  Jarvis is an avid traveller and has visited over 100 countries across all seven continents. After summitting Mount Kilimanjaro at the age of 23, he backpacked through rural Malawi where he was requested to name a newborn baby in a mudhut village he had been brought to by a local. It was requested that he use names from his culture that had meanings, so he used names of popular culutural characters that represented the villagers' values, choosing Fonzy (charisma, mechanical skills, cool) and Kermit (compassion, wisdom, leadership). In 2015 Fonzy Kermit Mwangomba named his first born son Greg after his 'white father' who had provided financial support to him throughout his life. Following a return visit to Masoko village in 2017, Jarvis successfully raised funds for Fonzy to study to become a mechanic, as per his wish and his TV namesake.

Founded in 1998, Sageworks provides financial analysis and risk management software, in addition to creating products for commercial lenders. It collects financial information on the private sector by aggregating data from large accounting firms. The company also publishes \\"private company indicator\\" reports, which analyze activity and profitability in certain market segments. The firm is a private business key executives include co-founder and Chairman Brian Hamilton and CEO Scott Ogle.  History  Sageworks was founded in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1998 by serial entrepreneur Brian Hamilton and computer programmer Sarah Tourville. The two met while Hamilton was teaching at Duke University Continuing Studies in the early 1990s. Tourville, one of Hamilton's students, said she could program a financial analysis system after Hamilton said that no one has come up with a way to automate certain analyses. In the late 1990s Hamilton and Tourville spent two years developing software for what was to be known as Sageworks' Financial Information into Narrative Data (FIND), the technology behind its ProfitCents product. Initially the firm struggled to properly market its tools in the early 2000s. CitiBank and Intuit were both early adopters. Sageworks has collected financial data since financial statement year 2001. By 2014, it included 2001-2011 data from nearly 240,000 private firms, including three or more consecutive years of financial data for each of 99,040. (full paper available in pre-publication form) It provides financial performance data on private companies based on their income statements and balance sheets. The data is provided by large accounting firms that work with private companies, then anonymized by labeling each company with a unique identifier number. Commercial users are given access to aggregated data by industry and region and not the financials of individual companies. Its data tends to comprise figures from large private firms; as of 2014, it contained data on almost 240,000 private companies. This compares to Sageworks' multi-year data from 2001-2011 of 4,360 public U.S. firms.Commercial users are given access to aggregated data by industry and region and not the financials of individual companies. Its data tends to comprise figures from large private firms; as of 2014, it contained data on almost 240,000 private companies. In January 2004, the company announced a deal to license to LexisNexis its ProfitCents public product, which turns U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data from public companies into plain-English text reports. In 2013, Scott Ogle became chief executive officer. In 2014, Sageworks launched its LoanSage product, a platform for small business owners to get loans of up to $2 million in one day. That same year, the company unveiled Sageworks Bank Information, a cloud- based platform providing data on banks and credit unions with data of 6,000 U.S. banks and 7,000 credit unions. The same year it launched its CFO platform, a suite of financial analysis tools for financial executives with financial analysis, benchmarking, valuation, and industry data, and Sageworks Bank Information, a cloud-based platform with bank and credit union data. In November 2016, the company launched a platform that helps lenders provide financing for small and medium-sized businesses. In June 2017, it released its CashSage product, for analyzing cash flow. Uses Sageworks' data has been used by academics to analyze economics using data from private companies, where traditionally only a very small data-set of about 4,000 public companies that publicly reported their data was available. According to a paper from researchers with New York University and Harvard Business School, Sageworks' data is especially useful, because it is free of survivor bias and other selection biases. Sageworks also uses data to create the \\"Sageworks Private Company Indicator\\", which shows private-company sales growth and profit margins. The firm also occasionally issues aggregate information about average profitability of private firms in various industries.  Acquisition  In 2018, Accel-KKR acquired Sageworks for an undisclosed amount and became part of the Banker's Toolbox suite of products. In 2019, Banker's Toolbox sunset the Sageworks brand and re-branded themselves as Abrigo. Inmates to Entrepreneurs Sageworks and its co-founder, Hamilton, started a program called Inmates to Entrepreneurs in 2008. The program encourages prison inmates to start their own business. P The program is based on Hamilton's small business seminar, focusing on marketing, sales, customer service, accounting, finance and staffing. Participants make informal business plans and are paired with mentors.

He was a member of the Hip-Hop group Jet Life and performs under the aliases \\"Super Villain\\" and \\"Flamingo Barnes.\\" History Trademark Da Skydiver was born and raised in New Orleans, LA. Cited in a song as \\"Trade from Dunn Street.\\" He was introduced to Hip-Hop when he was eight years old by an older cousin who brought back a variety of music from his travels in the Navy. His cousin exposed him to all types of Hip-Hop including the Wu-Tang Clan. While constantly hearing Cash Money and No Limit Records in New Orleans, LA, Trademark also became heavily influenced by the New York sound and the Wu-Tang Clan entire discography, particularly Method Man‚Äôs album ‚ÄúTical 2000: Judgment Day.‚Äù After hearing that album, Trademark was inspired and began his rap career. Two of Trademark‚Äôs childhood friends were the rappers Curren$y and Young Roddy. Early on in his career, a mutual friend brought Trademark into a studio session and Curren$y was there. Curren$y got him to appear on a friend‚Äôs mixtape and from there, they both realized that their styles meshed well and continued to work in tandem on a variety of projects. Soon after that studio day, they formed Jet Life. Jet Life grew to include (at different points) Trademark Da Skydiver, Curren$y, Young Roddy, Corner Boy P, T.Y., Fiend, Street Wiz, Marygold, and producer Monsta Beatz. Trademark played a prominent role in the conception and execution of Jet Life's \\"Jet World Order\\" Series which were both released via Jet Life's partnership with iHipHop Distribution. In 2009, he began a three part series under the name ‚ÄúSuper Villain.‚Äù The name originated from his experiences as a young person being told what he could and couldn‚Äôt do, who he should be and shouldn‚Äôt be. Thus, he created the ‚ÄúSuper Villain‚Äù alias as a way to rebel against those boundaries. By creating an all-powerful persona, he was able to create a new style for this series that showcased his diversity and skill as a rapper. Trademark Da Skydiver released ‚ÄúFlamingo Barnes‚Äù in 2012 and then released ‚ÄúFlamingo Barnes 2: Mingo Royale‚Äù in 2013. After working for a few years with the Jet Life crew, Trademark decided to show his versatility and individual value as a rapper by creating the Flamingo Barnes project and subsequent record label with the same name. The two albums have been described as having trap music production with nods to the ASAP Mob sound but Trademark defines the style as just simply, ‚ÄúFlamingo Barnes.‚Äù Trademark was recently named an ‚ÄúArtist to Watch‚Äù on iTunes Hip-Hop Homepage. His music video for ‚ÄúRite Nah‚Äù featuring Dizzy Wright premiered on BET‚Äôs 106 & Park and is also in rotation on MTV Jams.

The new barracks became the depot for the two battalions of the 10th (North Lincolnshire) Regiment of Foot.

Rush announced his candidacy on March 24, 2014, with a two-day series of announcements in different Florida towns. Platform Stephen Colbert, a comedian, satirically described Rush as a \\"staunch conservative, a free-market capitalist, small government, walk softly and carry a big stick kind of guy.\\" Colbert also stated that Rush \\"is running on a platform of traditional marriage, strict constitutionalism, strong national defense, and repealing Obamacare\\", which Rush agreed was true. Rush had three main points he listed running on, being: *Focusing on the economy, *Decreasing spending, and *Building a country where private businesses create jobs. Rush characterized himself as a \\"straight shooter\\" and a conservative Republican. John Konkus, of the GOP consulting firm Jamestown Associates, served as Rush's media adviser. Alex Patton of Ozean Media served as campaign adviser. Rush was endorsed by the Conservative Party of Florida, a reversal of their endorsement of incumbent Ted Yoho in the last election cycle. Career Previously, Rush worked as a Sheriff's deputy at the Alachua County Sheriff's Office under Sheriff Steve Oelrich. While in that position, part of Rush's roles were to investigate D.U.I.s. Rush returned to the force after law school, still at the A.S.O., as a volunteer reserve deputy. As of mid 2014, Rush works for his father's firm, the Law Office of Robert A. Rush, otherwise known as Rush & Glassman. As of late 2019, Rush is no longer employed with that firm. Personal life Rush is the son of Robert and Kristy Rush and was raised in their home town of Gainesville, Florida. Robert is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and the University of Florida. He was a producer of the Gainesville production of Elvis People, working with associate producer Emilee MacDonald and playwright Doug Grissom. After high school, Rush was selected to attend the West Point Military Academy, but declined the offer to attend the University of Florida, his father's alma mater. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in Classics. While at university, Rush participated in the Theatre Strike Force, an improv acting club. Rush received national attention for his involvement in live action role playing (LARP). Rush is a member of The Mind's Eye Society, an online role playing community described as \\"not dissimilar from Dungeons and Dragons, but with a Gothic supernatural bent.\\" He is also a leader in the Gainesville Covenant of the Poisoned Absinthe, a live action roleplaying group made up \\"of an assortment of games from White Wolf's selection, including Vampire: The Masquerade, Changeling: The Lost, and Mage: The Awakening.\\" Prior to announcing his candidacy, Rush deleted some photos and websites regarding his role-playing activities, and told the Gainesville Sun that \\"I had scrubbed as much as I could Google of myself, just because it's a little embarrassing, and I didn't want it to overshadow my campaign.

It covers the naval battles and technology used during the War of 1812. It is considered a seminal work in its field, and had a massive impact on the formation of the modern American Navy.Morris, Edmund. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, Ballantine Books 1979. Background Theodore Roosevelt graduated from Harvard University in 1880, and was soon after married to Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt. While attending Columbia Law School and living in Manhattan, Roosevelt began completing research on a book he had started while still at Harvard. He had already completed two chapters of the book, and had finished it by December 1881. Roosevelt set out to write about a subject that both technically and historically challenged him. He decided on chronicling the naval battles between the British and American navies during the War of 1812. He tried to analyze the facts as unbiasedly as possible, looking at both American and British documents from the period, as well as some others from Continental Europe. Content Roosevelt introduces the war by discussing the political and social climates of both Great Britain and America before the war. He makes several scathing comments on American unpreparedness for the war, putting the blame especially on President Thomas Jefferson. Roosevelt then discusses, year by year, the naval wars on both the Atlantic Ocean and on the lakes of the Americas. He follows mainly the American crews, but discuss both sides' strengths and weaknesses. Roosevelt's analysis of each crew and commanders role in particular battles leaves the reader with no doubts as to who should receive glory and who should be shamed. He is not absolutely pro- American either. His criticism of Oliver Hazard Perry at the Battle of Lake Erie shows this well. Throughout the book, he praises both sides of the conflict. Conclusion Roosevelt concludes that the Americans left the war with a deserved naval victory. However, he does note that this victory was largely moral; the small, singular battles did not have a major effect on Britain's naval arsenal. It did, he notes, give the American people confidence, while on land their army was consistently beaten, with some exceptions, such as the Battle of New Orleans.DiNunzio, Mario R. Theodore Roosevelt: An American Mind, Palgrave Macmillan, 1994. Impact The book is considered one of the best in its field. It was a considerable achievement for the 23-year-old Roosevelt, who had to learn the technical side of naval terminology and technology. While it was criticized by some for being scholarly and boring, it did well, going through four editions in six years. In 1886, just four years after being published, the U.S. Navy ordered a copy of the book to be placed on every ship. It also affected Roosevelt's later career, bringing his attention to the importance of a strong navy on national power. He would go on to be Assistant Secretary of the Navy, where he helped modernize and build the American navy; as President, he took a keen interest in the navy, including dispatching the Great White Fleet. This contributed significantly to America's rise as a world power. The book also influenced Alfred Thayer Mahan when he wrote The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, considered the greatest work on naval war in history.

It enjoyed considerable critical and commercial success, was nominated for the Nordic Council's Literature Prize, and has been widely translated. Synopsis The novel is set in Reykjav√≠k during the boom that preceded the 2008‚Äì11 Icelandic financial crisis. The protagonist of the novel is Eva, an Icelander who spent most of her formative years in California, and works as an artist. Largely estranged from her family, recently abandoned by her long-term partner Hrafn (and emotionally scarred by the cot-death some years before of her daughter by him), and implicitly without a very successful career, Eva moves from New York to Reykjav√≠k, taking up the offer of an Icelandic banker, Emil √ûorsson, to house-sit his flat, in one of the new developments on S√¶braut, opposite the sculpture S√≥lfar. After a series of somewhat strange encounters with neighbours which serve as opportunities to develop Eva's character and back- story, and to build narrative tension, Eva finds herself locked into the flat, a situation that persists for most of the novel. It emerges that the flat is full of hidden cameras and it is implied that Eva is in fact part of an art installation by a famous Serbo-Croatian artist, Joseph Novak. Eva is forced to follow instructions she receives by telephone to put her face into a face- shaped impression in the bedroom wall; while wearing this 'mask' she loses consciousness and generally finds herself unable to remember what happens to her. The third-person narrative is recounted largely from the point of view of Eva while not wearing the mask, during which time she often drinks heavily or takes sedatives. Eva makes attempts to escape, but is unsuccessful. The narrative focuses on the psychological torment inflicted on Eva by her imprisonment and her efforts to understand what happens to her while wearing the mask. It is hinted that she is (or at least believes she is) variously sexually abused; paraded as a celebrity at parties for the elite of the banking and art worlds; reunited with Hrafn; and eventually celebrated herself as a successful artist. Aspects of the story are continued in Steinar Bragi's 2009 Himinninn yfir √ûingv√∂llum: √ûrj√°r s√∂gur. Analyses Eir√≠kur √ñrn Nor√∞dahl has read the novel in relation to the 2008‚Äì11 Icelandic financial crisis: :: Konur might be construed as a crisis-novel, where the newly-built house of nouveau riche plenty, owned by a ‚Äúfinancial viking‚Äù, turns on the inhabitant, starts torturing her before literally (and symbolically) devouring her. It is in all ways a novel written about the times pre-crisis and it successfully demonstrates the seeds of the city‚Äôs, and the country‚Äôs, self-destruction, through a kind of symbolic pre-cognition.Eir√≠kur √ñrn Nor√∞dahl, 'Literature in the Land of the Inherently Cute: The Search for Literary Crisis', in Booby, be Quiet!

In the assessment of J√ºrg Glauser, Konur is 'one of the books most obviously pessimistic about culture that have appeared in iceland in recent years'.'Eines der krassesten kulturpessimistischen B√ºcher, das in den letzten Jahren in Island erschienen ist': J√ºrg Glauser, _Island: Eine Literaturgeschichte_ (Stuttgart: Metzler, 2011), p. 153. He finds that the novel, 'a relentless story of the exploitation of the female body by contemporary art and media, draws an even deeper link between modern city architecture and the decay of the ethical foundations of society. In this text, contemporary architecture has reached an almost apocalyptic dimension and represents evil in itself'.'eine unerbittliche Geschichte √ºber die Ausbeutung des weiblichen K√∂rpers durch die Gegenwartskunst und -medien, nimmt eine noch st√§rkere Engf√ºhrung zwischen moderner Stadtarchitektur und dem Zerfall der ethischen Grundlagen der Gesellschaft vor. In diesem Text hat die zeitgen√∂ssische Architektur eine geradezu apokalyptische Dimension erreicht und repr√§sentiert das B√∂se an sich': J√ºrg Glauser, _Island: Eine Literaturgeschichte_ (Stuttgart: Metzler, 2011), p. 153. Other commentary too has focused on the novel's explorations of warped domestic spaces and the status of women.Karin Wideg√•rd, ‚ÄûSteinar Bragi  Kvinnor‚Äú, G√∂teborgs-Posten (24 September 2010).√ölfhildur Dagsd√≥ttir, ‚ÄûListin a√∞ p√≠na konur‚Äú, T√≠marit M√°ls og menningar, 70.4 (2009), 109-113.
