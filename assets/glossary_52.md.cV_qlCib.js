History Filmstaden was once one of the most modern film studios in Europe. It was built in 1919–1920 on the basis of designs by Swedish architect Ebbe Crone (1885-1960). It was owned and operated by SF Studios (Svensk Filmindustri), the main Swedish film producer at the time. Some 400 movies have been created at Filmstaden. The first movie to be filmed at Filmstaden was The Phantom Carriage (Körkarlen. 1921) by director Victor Sjöström. Practically all Swedish actors and film directors of the 20th century had some connection with Filmstaden. In 1969, Svensk Filmindustri left Filmstaden and the studios were used by small film producers, production of television dramas and the Riksteatern Theatre. One of the last major films to partly have been filmed at Filmstaden was The Emigrants (Utvandrarna. 1971) directed by Jan Troell. Most of the buildings were quite well preserved until the beginning of the 21st century when Filmstaden had to make way for a housing development. However, some buildings have been renovated and SF Studios has moved its headquarters back into a former studio building.

Reactions were anything but uniform, and proponents of various ideologies attempted to appropriate his work quite early. Overview Beginning while Nietzsche was still alive, though incapacitated by mental illness, many Germans discovered his appeals for greater heroic individualism and personality development in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but responded to those appeals in diverging ways. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s. Nietzsche's anarchistic influence was particularly strong in France and the United States.O. Ewald, \\"German Philosophy in 1907\\", in The Philosophical Review, Vol. 17, No. 4, Jul., 1908, pp. 400-426; T. A. Riley, \\"Anti-Statism in German Literature, as Exemplified by the Work of John Henry Mackay\\", in PMLA, Vol. 62, No. 3, Sep., 1947, pp. 828-843; C. E. Forth, \\"Nietzsche, Decadence, and Regeneration in France, 1891-95\\", in Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 54, No. 1, Jan., 1993, pp. 97-117 By World War I, German soldiers even received copies of Thus Spoke Zarathustra as gifts.Steven E. Aschheim notes that \\"[a]bout 150,000 copies of a specially durable wartime Zarathustra were distributed to the troops\\" in The Nietzsche Legacy in Germany, 1890-1990, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1992, p. 135Kaufmann, p. 8 The Dreyfus Affair provides another example of his reception: the French antisemitic Right labelled the Jewish and leftist intellectuals who defended Alfred Dreyfus as \\"Nietzscheans\\".Schrift, A.D. (1995). Nietzsche's French Legacy: A Genealogy of Poststructuralism. Routledge. . Such seemingly paradoxical acceptance by diametrically opposed camps is typical of the history of the reception of Nietzsche's thought. In the context of the rise of French fascism, one researcher notes, \\"Although, as much recent work has stressed, Nietzsche had an important impact on \\"leftist\\" French ideology and theory, this should not obscure the fact that his work was also crucial to the right and to the neither right nor left fusions of developing French fascism.Mary Ann Frese Witt, The Search for Modern Tragedy, Cornell University Press, 2001, p. 137 Indeed, as Ernst Nolte proposed, Maurrassian ideology of \\"aristocratic revolt against egalitarian-utopian 'transcendence'\\" (transcendence being Nolte's term for the ontological absence of theodic center justifying modern \\"emancipation culture\\"), the interrelation between Nietzschean ideology and proto-fascism offer extensive space for criticism and the Nietzschean ambiance pervading French ideological fermentation of extremism in time birthing formal fascism, is unavoidable. Many political leaders of the 20th century were at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche's ideas. However, it is not always possible to determine whether or not they actually read his work. Regarding Hitler, for example, there is a debate. Some authors claim that he probably never read Nietzsche, or that if he did, his reading was not extensive.Weaver Santaniello, Nietzsche, God, and the Jews, SUNY Press, 1994, p. 41: \\"Hitler probably never read a word of Nietzsche\\"; Berel Lang, Post-Holocaust: Interpretation, Misinterpretation, and the Claims of History, Indiana University Press, 2005, p. 162: \\"Arguably, Hitler himself never read a word of Nietzsche; certainly, if he did read him, it was not extensively\\"; Jacob Golomb, Nietzsche and Jewish Culture, Routledge, 1997, p. 9: \\"To be sure, it is almost certain that Hitler either never read Nietzsche directly or read very little.\\"; Andrew C. Janos, East Central Europe in the Modern World, Stanford University Press, 2002, p. 184: \\"By all indications, Hitler never read Nietzsche. Neither Mein Kampf nor Hitler's Table Talk (Tischgesprache) mentions his name. In all fairness, one may say Hitler did read Nietzsche in some capacity, but not in a scholarly fashion. In any case, Nietzschean ideas reached him through the filter of Alfred Rosenberg's Myth of the Twentieth Century, and, more simply, through what was coffeehouse Quatsch in Vienna and Munich. This at least is the impression he gives in his published conversations with Dietrich Eckart.\\" Hitler more than likely became familiar with Nietzsche quotes during his time in Vienna when quotes by Nietzsche were frequently published in pan-German newspapers.Brigitte Hamann, Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship, p.74 Nevertheless, others point to a quote in Hitler's Table Talk, where the dictator mentioned Nietzsche when he spoke about what he called \\"great men\\", as an indication that Hitler may have been familiarized with Nietzsche's work.Jacob Golomb & Robert S. Wistrich (2002), \\"Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism? On the Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy\\", Princeton University Press, 2007. Retrieved on June 8th, 2013. \\"In Hitler's Table Talk, [Hitler] refers to Nietzsche, saying: \\"In our part of the world, the Jews would have immediately eliminated Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Kant. If the Bolsheviks had dominion over us for 200 years, what works of our past would be handed on to posterity? Our great men would fall into oblivion, or else they'd be presented to future generations as criminals and bandits.\\" Other authors like Melendez (2001) point out to the parallels between Hitler's and Nietzsche's titanic anti-egalitarianism,Meléndez Germán (2001), Nietzsche en perspectiva, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, pages 255-258. Chapter \\"Poder y Anti-igualitarismo en Nietzsche y Hitler\\", by Ernst Tugendhat. and the idea of the \\"übermensch\\",Star Alexander, The New York Times, January 13, 2012. a term which was frequently used by Hitler and Mussolini to refer to the so-called \\"Aryan race\\", or rather, its projected future after fascist engineering. Alfred Rosenberg, an influential Nazi ideologist, also delivered a speech in which he related National Socialism to Nietzsche's ideology.Rosenberg is quoted \\"In a truly historical sense, the movement eclipses the rest of the world, much as Nietzsche, the individual, eclipsed the powers of his times.\\" Broadly speaking, despite Nietzsche's hostility towards anti-semitism and nationalism, the Nazis made very selective use of Nietzsche's philosophy, and eventually, this association caused Nietzsche's reputation to suffer following World War II.Rafael Arévalo Martínez (1943), Nietzsche el conquistador: (la doctrina que engendró la segunda guerra mundial.), Tipografía Sánchez & De Guise, 170 pp. On the other hand, it is known that Mussolini early on heard lectures about Nietzsche, Vilfredo Pareto, and others in ideologically forming fascism. A girlfriend of Mussolini, Margherita Sarfatti, who was Jewish, relates that Nietzsche virtually was the transforming factor in Mussolini's \\"conversion\\" from hard socialism to spiritualistic, ascetic fascism,Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi, Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy, University of California Press, 2000, p. 44: \\"In 1908 he presented his conception of the superman's role in modern society in a writing on Nietzsche entitled, \\"The Philosophy of Force.\\" Nietzsche's influence on Continental philosophy increased dramatically after the Second World War.  Nietzsche and anarchism  During the 19th century, Nietzsche was frequently associated with anarchist movements, in spite of the fact that in his writings he definitely holds a negative view of egalitarian anarchists.In Beyond Good and Evil (6.2:126), to only cite one volcanic attack against anarchists of modernity, he refers to \\"anarchist dogs\\" Nevertheless, Nietzsche's ideas generated strong interest from key figures from the historical anarchist movement which began in the 1890s. According to a recent study, \\"Gustav Landauer, Emma Goldman and others reflected on the chances offered and the dangers posed by these ideas in relation to their own politics. Heated debates over meaning, for example on the will to power or on the status of women in Nietzsche’s works, provided even the most vehement critics such as Peter Kropotkin with productive cues for developing their own theories. In recent times, a newer strand called post-anarchism has invoked Nietzsche’s ideas, while also disregarding the historical variants of Nietzschean anarchism. This calls into question the innovative potential of post-anarchism.\\" Some hypothesize on certain grounds Nietzsche's violent stance against anarchism may (at least partially) be the result of a popular association during this period between his ideas and those of Max Stirner.\\"Nietzsche's possible reading, knowledge, and plagiarism of Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own (1845) has been a contentious question and frequently discussed for more than a century now.\\" Thomas H. Brobjer, \\"Philologica: A Possible Solution to the Stirner-Nietzsche Question\\", in The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 25, Spring 2003, pp. 109-114 Thus far, no plagiarism has been detected at all, but a probable concealed influence in his formative years. Spencer Sunshine writes, \\"There were many things that drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of \\"herds\\"; his anti-Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the state on cultural production; his desire for an \\"overman\\" — that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, \\"Yes\\" to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the \\"transvaluation of values\\" as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history.\\"Spencer Sunshine, \\"Nietzsche and the Anarchists\\" Lacking in Nietzsche is the anarchist utopian-egalitarian belief that every soul is capable of epic greatness: Nietzsche's aristocratic elitism is the death-knell of any Nietzschean conventional anarchism. According to Sunshine: \\"The list is not limited to culturally oriented anarchists such as Emma Goldman, who gave dozens of lectures about Nietzsche and baptized him as an honorary anarchist. Pro-Nietzschean anarchists also include prominent Spanish CNT–FAI members in the 1930s such as Salvador Seguí and anarcha- feminist Federica Montseny; anarcho-syndicalist militants like Rudolf Rocker; and even the younger Murray Bookchin, who cited Nietzsche's conception of the 'transvaluation of values' in support of the Spanish anarchist project.\\" Also in European individualist anarchist circles his influence is clear in thinker/activists such as Emile ArmandThe Anarchism of Émile Armand by Emile Armand and Renzo NovatoreToward the Creative Nothing by Renzo Novatore among others. Also more recently in post-left anarchy, Nietzsche is present in the thought of Hakim Bey and Wolfi Landstreicher.  Nietzsche and fascism  The Italian and German fascist regimes were eager to lay claim to Nietzsche's ideas, and to position themselves as inspired by them. In 1932, Nietzsche's sister, Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche, received a bouquet of roses from Adolf Hitler during a German premiere of Benito Mussolini's 100 Days, and in 1934 Hitler personally presented her with a wreath for Nietzsche's grave carrying the words \\"To A Great Fighter\\". Also in 1934, Elisabeth gave to Hitler Nietzsche's favorite walking stick, and Hitler was photographed gazing into the eyes of a white marble bust of Nietzsche.John Rodden, Repainting the Little Red Schoolhouse: A History of Eastern German Education, 1945-1995, Oxford University Press, 2002, p 289 Heinrich Hoffmann's popular biography Hitler as Nobody Knows Him (which sold nearly a half-million copies by 1938) featured this photo with the caption reading: \\"The Führer before the bust of the German philosopher whose ideas have fertilized two great popular movements: the national socialist of Germany and the fascist of Italy.\\"Hans D. Sluga, Heidegger's Crisis: Philosophy and Politics in Nazi Germany, Harvard University Press, 1993, p 179 Nietzsche was no less popular among French fascists, perhaps with more doctrinal truthfulness, as Robert S. Wistrich has pointed out > The \\"fascist\\" Nietzsche was above all considered to be a heroic opponent of > necrotic Enlightenment \\"rationality\\" and a kind of spiritual vitalist, who > had glorified war and violence in an age of herd-lemming shopkeepers, > inspiring the anti-Marxist revolutions of the interwar period. According to > the French fascist Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, it was the Nietzschean emphasis > on the autotelic power of the Will that inspired the mystic voluntarism and > political activism of his comrades. Such politicized readings were > vehemently rejected by another French writer, the socialo-communist > anarchist Georges Bataille, who in the 1930s sought to establish (in > ambiguous success) the \\"radical incompatibility\\" between Nietzsche (as a > thinker who abhorred mass politics) and \\"the fascist reactionaries.\\" He > argued that nothing was more alien to Nietzsche than the pan-Germanism, > racism, militarism and anti-Semitism of the Nazis, into whose service the > German philosopher had been pressed.Jacob Golomb, Robert S. Wistrich, > Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism?: On The Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy, > Princeton University Press, 2002, p 162 Bataille here was sharp-witted but > combined half-truths without his customary dialectical finesse. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger, an active member of the Nazi Party, noted that everyone in his day was either 'for' or 'against' Nietzsche while claiming that this thinker heard a \\"command to reflect on the essence of a planetary domination.\\" Alan D. Schrift cites this passage and writes, \\"That Heidegger sees Nietzsche heeding a command to reflect and prepare for earthly domination is of less interest to me than his noting that everyone thinks in terms of a position for or against Nietzsche. In particular, the gesture of setting up 'Nietzsche' as a battlefield on which to take one's stand against or to enter into competition with the ideas of one's intellectual predecessors or rivals has happened quite frequently in the twentieth century.\\"Alan D. Schrift (Ed.), Why Nietzsche still?, University of California Press, 2000, pp 184–185 Marching in ideological warfare against the arrows from Bataille, Thomas Mann, Albert Camus and others, the Nazi movement, despite Nietzsche' virulent hatred of both volkist-populist socialist and nationalism (\\"national socialism\\"), did, in certain of its emphases, share an affinity with Nietzsche's ideas, including his ferocious attacks against democracy, egalitarianism, the communistic-socialistic social model, popular Christianity, parliamentary government, and a number of other things. In The Will to Power Nietzsche praised – sometimes metaphorically, other times both metaphorically and literally – the sublimity of war and warriors, and heralded an international ruling race that would become the \\"lords of the earth\\". Here Nietzsche was referring to pan-Europeanism of a Caesarist type, positively embracing Jews, not a Germanic master race but a neo-imperial elite of culturally refined \\"redeemers\\" of humanity, which was otherwise considered wretched and plebeian and ugly in its mindless existence. The Nazis appropriated, or rather received also inspiration in this case, from Nietzsche's extremely old-fashioned and semi-feudal views on women: Nietzsche despised modern feminism, along with democracy and socialism, as mere egalitarian leveling movements of nihilism. He forthrightly declared, \\"Man shall be trained for war and woman for the procreation of the warrior, anything else is folly\\"; and was indeed unified with the Nazi world-view at least in terms of the social role of women: \\"They belong in the kitchen and their chief role in life is to beget children for German warriors.\\"William Lawrence Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, Simon and Schuster, 1960, pp 99–101. Here is one area where Nietzsche indeed did not contradict the Nazis in his politics of \\"aristocratic radicalism.\\" During the interbellum years, certain Nazis had employed a highly selective reading of Nietzsche's work to advance their ideology, notably Alfred Baeumler, who strikingly omitted the fact of Nietzsche's anti-socialism and anti-nationalism (for Nietzsche, both equally contemptible mass herd movements of modernity) in his reading of The Will to Power. The era of Nazi rule (1933–1945) saw Nietzsche's writings widely studied in German (and, after 1938, Austrian) schools and universities. Despite the fact that Nietzsche had expressed his disgust with plebeian-volkist antisemitism and supremacist German nationalism in the most forthright terms possible (e.g. he resolved \\"to have nothing to do with anyone involved in the perfidious race-fraud\\"), phrases like \\"the will to power\\" became common in Nazi circles. The wide popularity of Nietzsche among Nazis stemmed in part from the endeavors of his sister, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, the editor of Nietzsche's work after his 1889 breakdown, and an eventual Nazi sympathizer. Mazzino Montinari, while editing Nietzsche's posthumous works in the 1960s, found that Förster- Nietzsche, while editing the posthumous fragments making up The Will to Power, had cut extracts, changed their order, quoted him out of context, etc.Mazzino Montinari, \\"La Volonté de puissance\\" n'existe pas, Éditions de l'Éclat, 1996 Nietzsche's reception among the more intellectually percipient or zealous fascists was not universally warm. For example, one \\"rabidly Nazi writer, Curt von Westernhagen, who announced in his book Nietzsche, Juden, Antijuden (1936) that the time had come to expose the 'defective personality of Nietzsche whose inordinate tributes for, and espousal of, Jews had caused him to depart from the Germanic principles enunciated by Meister Richard Wagner'.\\"Jacob Golomb, Robert S. Wistrich, Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism?: On The Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy, Princeton University Press, 2002, p 149 > The real problem with the labelling of Nietzsche as a fascist, or worse, a > Nazi, is that it ignores the fact that Nietzsche's aristocratism seeks to > revive an older conception of politics, one which he locates in Greek agon > which [...] has striking affinities with the philosophy of action expounded > in our own time by Hannah Arendt. Once an affinity like this is appreciated, > the absurdity of describing Nietzsche's political thought as 'fascist', or > Nazi, becomes readily apparent.Keith Ansell-Pearson, An Introduction to > Nietzsche as Political Thinker: The Perfect Nihilist, Cambridge University > Press, 1994, pp 33–34  Nietzsche and Zionism  Jacob Golomb observed, \\"Nietzsche's ideas were widely disseminated among and appropriated by the first Hebrew Zionist writers and leaders.\\"Jacob Golomb, Nietzsche and Zion, Cornell University Press, 2004, p. 1 According to Steven Aschheim, \\"Classical Zionism, that essentially secular and modernizing movement, was acutely aware of the crisis of Jewish tradition and its supporting institutions. Nietzsche was enlisted as an authority for articulating the movement's ruptured relationship with the past and a force in its drive to normalization and its activist ideal of self- creating Hebraic New Man.\\"Steven E. Aschheim, The Nietzsche legacy in Germany, 1890-1990, University of California Press, 1994, p 102 Francis R. Nicosia notes, \\"At the height of his fame between 1895 and 1902, some of Nietzsche's ideas seemed to have a particular resonance for some Zionists, including Theodor Herzl.\\"Francis R. Nicosia, Zionism and Anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany, Cambridge University Press, 2008, p 36 Under his editorship the Neue Freie Presse dedicated seven consecutive issues to Nietzsche obituaries, and Golomb notes that Herzl's cousin Raoul Auernheimer claimed Herzl was familiar with Nietzsche and had \\"absorbed his style.\\"Jacob Golomb, Nietzsche and Zion, Cornell University Press, 2004, pp 25–27 However, Gabriel Sheffer suggests that Herzl was too bourgeois and too eager to be accepted into mainstream society to be much of a revolutionary (even an \\"aristocratic\\" one), and hence could not have been strongly influenced by Nietzsche, but remarks, \\"Some East European Jewish intellectuals, such as the writers Yosef Hayyim Brenner and Micha Josef Berdyczewski, followed after Herzl because they thought that Zionism offered the chance for a Nietzschean 'transvaluation of values' within Jewry\\".Gabriel Sheffer, U.S.-Israeli Relations at the Crossroads, Routledge, 1997, p 170 Nietzsche also influenced Theodor Lessing. Martin Buber was fascinated by Nietzsche, whom he praised as a heroic figure, and he strove to introduce \\"a Nietzschean perspective into Zionist affairs.\\" In 1901, Buber, who had just been appointed the editor of Die Welt, the primary publication of the World Zionist Organization, published a poem in Zarathustrastil (a style reminiscent of Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra) calling for the return of Jewish literature, art and scholarship.Jacob Golomb (Ed.), Nietzsche and Jewish Culture, Routledge, 1997, pp 235–236 Max Nordau, an early Zionist orator and controversial racial anthropologist, insisted that Nietzsche had been insane since birth, and advocated \\"branding his disciples [...] as hysterical and imbecile.\\"Robert S. Wistrich, Laboratory for World Destruction: Germans and Jews in Central Europe, University of Nebraska Press, 2007, p 158  Nietzsche, analytical psychology and psychoanalysis  Carl Jung, the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology, recognized Nietzsche's profundity early on. \\"From the time Jung first became gripped by Nietzsche’s ideas as a student in Basel to his days as a leading figure in the psychoanalytic movement, Jung read, and increasingly developed, his own thought in a dialogue with the work of Nietzsche. … Untangling the exact influence of Nietzsche on Jung, however, is a complicated business. Jung never openly addressed the exact influence Nietzsche had on his own concepts, and when he did link his own ideas to Nietzsche’s, he almost never made it clear whether the idea in question was inspired by Nietzsche or whether he merely discovered the parallel at a later stage.\\" In 1934, Jung held a lengthy and insightful seminar on Nietzsche's Zarathustra.Jung Timeline In 1936, Jung explained that Germans of the present day had been seized or possessed by the psychic force known in Germanic mythology as Wotan, \\"the god of storm and frenzy, the unleasher of passions and the lust of battle\\"—Wotan being synonymous with Nietzsche's Dionysus, Jung said. A 12th-century stick found among the Bryggen inscriptions, Bergen, Norway bears a runic message by which the population called upon Thor and Wotan for help: Thor is asked to receive the reader, and Wotan to own them.McLeod, Mees (2006:30). \\"Nietzsche provided Jung both with the terminology (the Dionysian) and the case study (Zarathustra as an example of the Dionysian at work in the psyche) to help him put into words his thoughts about the spirit of his own age: an age confronted with an uprush of the Wotanic/Dionysian spirit in the collective unconscious. This, in a nutshell, is how Jung came to see Nietzsche, and explains why he was so fascinated by Nietzsche as a thinker.\\" Nietzsche had also an important influence on psychotherapist and founder of the school of individual psychology Alfred Adler. According to Ernest Jones, biographer and personal acquaintance of Sigmund Freud, Freud frequently referred to Nietzsche as having \\"more penetrating knowledge of himself than any man who ever lived or was likely to live\\".Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud Yet Jones also reports that Freud emphatically denied that Nietzsche's writings influenced his own psychological discoveries; in the 1890s, Freud, whose education at the University of Vienna in the 1870s had included a strong relationship with Franz Brentano, his teacher in philosophy, from whom he had acquired an enthusiasm for Aristotle and Ludwig Feuerbach, was acutely aware of the possibility of convergence of his own ideas with those of Nietzsche and doggedly refused to read the philosopher as a result. In his excoriating — but also sympathetic — critique of psychoanalysis, The Psychoanalytic Movement, Ernest Gellner depicts Nietzsche as setting out the conditions for elaborating a realistic psychology, in contrast with the eccentrically implausible Enlightenment psychology of Hume and Smith, and assesses the success of Freud and the psychoanalytic movement as in large part based upon its success in meeting this \\"Nietzschean minimum\\".Gellner, Ernest, The Psychoanalytic Movement.

P. Lovecraft, Olaf Stapledon, Menno ter Braak, Richard Wright, Robert E. Howard, and Jack London. American writer H. L. Mencken avidly read and translated Nietzsche's works and has gained the sobriquet \\"the American Nietzsche\\". In his book on Nietzsche, Mencken portrayed the philosopher as a proponent of anti-egalitarian aristocratic revolution, a depiction in sharp contrast with left-wing interpretations of Nietzsche. Nietzsche was declared an honorary anarchist by Emma Goldman, and he influenced other anarchists such as Guy Aldred, Rudolf Rocker, Max Cafard and John Moore. The popular conservative writer, philosopher, poet, journalist and theological apologist of Catholicism G. K. Chesterton expressed contempt for Nietzsche's ideas, deeming his philosophy basically a poison or death-wish of Western culture: Thomas Mann's essays mention Nietzsche with respect and even adoration, although one of his final essays, \\"Nietzsche's Philosophy in the Light of Recent History\\", looks at his favorite philosopher through the lens of Nazism and World War II and ends up placing Nietzsche at a more critical distance. Many of Nietzsche's ideas, particularly on artists and aesthetics, are incorporated and explored throughout Mann's works. The theme of the aesthetic justification of existence Nietzsche introduced from his earliest writings, in \\"The Birth of Tragedy\\" declaring sublime art as the only metaphysical consolation of existence; and in the context of fascism and Nazism, the Nietzschean aestheticization of politics void of morality and ordered by caste hierarchy in service of the creative caste, has posed many problems and questions for thinkers in contemporary times. One of the characters in Mann's 1947 novel Doktor Faustus represents Nietzsche fictionally. In 1938 the German existentialist Karl Jaspers wrote the following about the influence of Nietzsche and Søren Kierkegaard: Bertrand Russell in his History of Western Philosophy was scathing in his chapter on Nietzsche, calling his work the \\"mere power- phantasies of an invalid\\" and referring to Nietzsche as a \\"megalomaniac\\". Russell is here depicting the \\"hard Nietzsche\\" very few today would recognize. In one particularly harsh section, he says: Likewise, the fictional valet Reginald Jeeves, created by author P.G. Wodehouse, is a fan of Baruch Spinoza, recommending his works to his employer, Bertie Wooster over those of Friedrich Nietzsche:  Nietzsche after World War II  The appropriation of Nietzsche's work by the Nazis, combined with the rise of analytic philosophy, ensured that British and American academic philosophers would almost completely ignore him until at least 1950. Even George Santayana, an American philosopher whose life and work betray some similarity to Nietzsche's, dismissed Nietzsche in his 1916 Egotism in German Philosophy as a \\"prophet of Romanticism\\". Analytic philosophers, if they mentioned Nietzsche at all, characterized him as a literary figure rather than as a philosopher. Nietzsche's present stature in the English-speaking world owes much to the exegetical writings and improved Nietzsche translations by the Jewish-German, American philosopher Walter Kaufmann and the British scholar R.J. Hollingdale. Nietzsche's influence on Continental philosophy increased dramatically after the Second World War, especially among the French intellectual Left and post-structuralists. According to the philosopher René Girard,René Girard, \\"Dionysus versus the Crucified\\", MLN, Vol. 99, No. 4 (Sep., 1984), pp. 816–835. Nietzsche's greatest political legacy lies in his 20th-century French interpreters, among them Georges Bataille, Pierre Klossowski, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze (and Félix Guattari), and Jacques Derrida. This philosophical movement (originating with the work of Bataille) has been dubbed French Nietzscheanism.Alan D. Schrift, Poststructuralism and Critical Theory's Second Generation, Routledge, 2014, ch. 1: French Nietzscheanism. Foucault's later writings, for example, revise Nietzsche's genealogical method to develop anti-foundationalist theories of power that divide and fragment rather than unite polities (as evinced in the liberal tradition of political theory). Deleuze, arguably the foremost of Nietzsche's Leftist interpreters, used the much-maligned \\"will to power\\" thesis in tandem with Marxian notions of commodity surplus and Freudian ideas of desire to articulate concepts such as the rhizome and other \\"outsides\\" to state power as traditionally conceived. Gilles Deleuze and Pierre Klossowski wrote monographs drawing new attention to Nietzsche's work, and a 1972 conference at Cérisy-la-Salle ranks as the most important event in France for a generation's reception of Nietzsche. In Germany interest in Nietzsche was revived from the 1980s onwards, particularly by the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, who has devoted several essays to Nietzsche. Ernst Nolte the German historian, in his literature analyzing fascism and Nazism, presented Nietzsche as a force of the Counter-Enlightenment and foe of all modern \\"emancipation politics\\", and Nolte's judgment generated impassioned dialogue. In recent years, Nietzsche has also influenced members of the analytical philosophy tradition, such as Bernard Williams in his last finished book, Truth And Truthfulness: An Essay In Genealogy (2002). Prior to that Arthur Danto, with his book, Nietzsche as Philosopher (1965), presented what was the first full-length study of Nietzsche by an analytical philosopher. Then later, Alexander Nehamas, came out with his book, Nietzsche: Life as Literature (1985).

In the United States, they are known as hours of service. Within the European Union, Directive 2002/15/EC is setting the rules regarding working time for drivers carrying out road transport activities in the European Union from the point of view of improving road safety, health and safety of drivers and ensure fair competition among transport operators. Working time of mobile workers is a strictly national obligation to implement and to check and it cannot be imposed to drivers from third countries. Regulation (EC) 561/2006 is the regulation complementing the aforementioned Directive in view of driving times, breaks and rest periods required to be taken by professional drivers of vehicles carrying goods or passengers in international or national transport operations. There are special circumstances when carriages and thus drivers may be exempt from the Directive 2002/15/EC. The Regulation (EC) 561/2006 applies to the carriage by road of goods by vehicles with a total mass exceeding 3.5 tonnes and to the transport by road of passengers by vehicles that are adapted to carry more than nine people (including the driver). It applies, irrespective of the country of registration of the vehicle, to carriage by road in the EU and between EU countries, Switzerland and European Economic Area countries. The Regulation exempts from its scope of application ten categories of carriages (Art. 3), but there are also specific national exemptions offered in Art. 13. Though EU countries have to inform the Commission of those specific national exemptions. UNECE have adopted in 1970 the European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport (AETR).United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, http://www.unece.org/trans/main/sc1/sc1aetr.html This Agreement is common for EU, EEA countries, and Switzerland as well as other non-EU countries of the European continent. All vehicles crossing an AETR signatory country during its transport operations (carriages) should obey the common rules set by the AETR agreement. Since September 2010, AETR rules have been amended to align closely with EU Regulation 561/2006. Under certain circumstances, drivers may instead fall within scope of the domestic rules of that country. In addition to the above requirements, drivers in the EU must also abide with the European Working Time Directive 2003/88/EC. Regulations In the European Union, drivers' working hours are regulated by EU regulation (EC) No 561/2006 which entered into force on 11 April 2007. The non-stop driving time may not exceed 4.5 hours. After 4.5 hours of driving the driver must take a break period of at least 45 minutes. However, this can be split into 2 breaks, the first being at least 15 minutes, and the second being at least 30 minutes in length. The daily driving time shall not exceed 9 hours. The daily driving time may be extended to at most 10 hours not more than twice during the week. The weekly driving time may not exceed 56 hours. In addition to this, a driver cannot exceed 90 hours driving in a fortnight. Within each period of 24 hours after the end of the previous daily rest period or weekly rest period a driver must take a new daily rest period. An 11-hour (or more) daily rest is called a regular daily rest period. Alternatively, a driver can split a regular daily rest period into two periods. The first period must be at least 3 hours of uninterrupted rest and can be taken at any time during the day. The second must be at least 9 hours of uninterrupted rest, giving a total minimum rest of 12 hours. A driver may reduce his daily rest period to no less than 9 continuous hours, but this can be done no more than three times between any two weekly rest periods; no compensation for the reduction is required. A daily rest that is less than 11 hours but at least 9 hours long is called a reduced daily rest period. When a daily rest is taken, this may be taken in a vehicle, as long as it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary. 'Multi-manning' The situation where, during each period of driving between any two consecutive daily rest periods, or between a daily rest period and a weekly rest period, there are at least two drivers in the vehicle to do the driving. For the first hour of multi-manning the presence of another driver or drivers is optional, but for the remainder of the period it is compulsory. This allows for a vehicle to depart from its operating centre and collect a second driver along the way, providing that this is done within 1 hour of the first driver starting work. Vehicles manned by two or more drivers are governed by the same rules that apply to single-manned vehicles, apart from the daily rest requirements. Where a vehicle is manned by two or more drivers, each driver must have a daily rest period of at least 9 consecutive hours within the 30-hour period that starts at the end of the last daily or weekly rest period. Organising drivers' duties in such a fashion enables a crew's duties to be spread over 21 hours. The maximum driving time for a two-man crew taking advantage of this concession is 20 hours before a daily rest is required (although only if both drivers are entitled to drive 10 hours). Under multi-manning, the 'second' driver in a crew may not necessarily be the same driver from the duration of the first driver's shift but could in principle be any number of drivers as long as the conditions are met. Whether these second drivers could claim the multi-manning concession in these circumstances would depend on their other duties. On a multi-manning operation the first 45 minutes of a period of availability will be considered to be a break, so long as the co-driver does no work. Journeys involving ferry or train transport Where a driver accompanies a vehicle that is being transported by ferry or train, the daily rest requirements are more flexible. A regular daily rest period may be interrupted no more than twice, but the total interruption must not exceed 1 hour in total. This allows for a vehicle to be driven on to a ferry and off again at the end of the crossing. Where the rest period is interrupted in this way, the total accumulated rest period must still be 11 hours. A bunk or couchette must be available during the rest period. Weekly rest A regular weekly rest period is a period of at least 45 consecutive hours. An actual working week starts at the end of a weekly rest period, and finishes when another weekly rest period is commenced, which may mean that weekly rest is taken in the middle of a fixed (Monday–Sunday) week. This is perfectly acceptable – the working week is not required to be aligned with the 'fixed' week defined in the rules, provided all the relevant limits are complied with. Alternatively, a driver can take a reduced weekly rest period of a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. If a reduction is taken, it must be compensated for by an equivalent period of rest taken in one block before the end of the third week following the week in question. The compensating rest must be attached to a period of rest of at least 9 hours – in effect either a weekly or a daily rest period. For example, where a driver reduces a weekly rest period to 33 hours in week 1, he must compensate for this by attaching a 12-hour period of rest to another rest period of at least 9 hours before the end of week 4. This compensation cannot be taken in several smaller periods. A weekly rest period that falls in two weeks may be counted in either week but not in both. However, a rest period of at least 69 hours in total may be counted as two back-to-back weekly rests (e.g. a 45-hour weekly rest followed by 24 hours), provided that the driver does not exceed 144 hours' work either before or after the rest period in question. Where reduced weekly rest periods are taken away from base, these may be taken in a vehicle, provided that it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary. Unforeseen events Provided that road safety is not jeopardised, and to enable a driver to reach a suitable stopping place, a departure from the EU rules may be permitted to the extent necessary to ensure the safety of persons, the vehicle or its load. Drivers must note all the reasons for doing so on the back of their tachograph record sheets (if using an analogue tachograph) or on a printout or temporary sheet (if using a digital tachograph) at the latest on reaching the suitable stopping place (see relevant sections covering manual entries). Repeated and regular occurrences, however, might indicate to enforcement officers that employers were not in fact scheduling work to enable compliance with the applicable rules.

The character first appeared on-screen on 30 January 2007 in the series nine episode \\"Into the Dark\\". Kensit had made a former unrelated guest appearance on Holby City sister show, Casualty, in 2001. Faye is a Ward Sister at Holby General, with a mysterious past including two dead husbands and a disabled son. Her storylines have seen her marry registrar Joseph Byrne (Luke Roberts), and develop feelings for consultant Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow) following the death of her son. Her introductory storyline, shot on location in Dubai, in which she kills her third husband and leaves for Holby, proved so popular that Kensit was shortlisted \\"Best Actress\\" in the 2007 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards for her portrayal of the character within three months of arriving on the show. However, the dramaticism of the character's storylines and the manner in which they reflect upon real NHS nurses has attracted criticism. Kensit left the show in the series thirteen episode \\"Snow Queens\\", broadcast on 28 December 2010. In 2019, Kensit agreed to reprise the role as part of the show's twentieth anniversary celebrations. Development =Creation= Early publicity for the character gave her name as Eliza Clark. This was ultimately changed to Faye Morton, and although Faye did not first appear on- screen until January 2007, the announcement that Patsy Kensit had been cast in the role was made on 14 December 2005. Holby City executive producer Richard Stokes and series producer Emma Turner spoke of their delight at Kensit's casting, describing her as \\"a talented and popular actress who lights up the screen.\\" Kensit took the role in Holby City after two years of working on the ITV soap opera Emmerdale, commenting that she was \\"thrilled\\" to be offered the part, and was looking forward to working in London. Having formerly worked in Yorkshire to film Emmerdale, working in London reduced the actress' daily commute to 45 minutes. Television critic Jim Shelley noted that Kensit's casting in the role followed a trend of Holby City producers for hiring established actors, including comedian Adrian Edmondson and Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell. In preparation for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research. She commented on the experience: \\"I wanted to throw up. First of all I stood in the corner but in the end I couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women. They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such love and care... I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't think I could cope.\\" In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed \\"a convincing performance\\". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: \\"Making films isn't for me any more because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this is something I grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll stay as long as they want me, I feel like I've come back home.\\" =Personality and relationships= Initial publicity for the character billed her as \\"a nurse who has more than a few secrets to hide and an attitude that cannot fail to ruffle the feathers of her colleagues.\\" The Daily Express have described her as \\"Gregarious...likes a gossip, but she's emotionally vulnerable\\", while Holby City actress Tina Hobley has compared Faye to her own character, Chrissie Williams, explaining that \\"Faye is a quieter character all round who will do anything for an easy life, whereas Chrissie likes to stir up a bit of drama. I think she sees Faye as a goody two shoes.\\" In the flashback episode \\"What Lies Beneath\\", exploring Faye's decision to move to Holby, she is seen to fight with her husband James, then later step over his dead body on the stairs. Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a relationship with cardiothoracic registrar Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers). The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: \\"For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!\\" Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and became involved with his colleague Joseph Byrne. In terms of friendships, Faye is close to Ward Sister Kyla Tyson (Rakie Ayola). Though the BBC describe Faye and Chrissie as rivals, Hobley has commented: \\"I'd like there to be more development with Chrissie and Faye's relationship as they've only really had Sam as a common interest up until now. I just hope its friendship that develops, because I can't bear all that bitchy cat-fighting stuff.\\" =Return= In 2019, Kensit and Roberts agreed to reprise their roles as Faye and Joseph as part of the show's twentieth anniversary celebrations. The production team created a special episode focused on the characters of Faye, Joseph and Jac. Kensit was honoured to be asked to return and thought that the return episode was \\"gripping\\" television. She added that \\"Faye has changed quite a lot, it’s very feisty and there are lots of surprises! It’s also really exciting to be working with Rosie and Luke again.\\" Holby City's executive producer Simon Harper said that Faye and Joseph were \\"two huge, iconic characters\\" and their return would be a \\"nostalgic and exciting treat for long-term viewers.\\" Harper described the \\"unique episode\\" as centric to the \\"classic Darwin trio with all their past tensions and rivalries bubbling to the surface.\\" He added that Faye and Jac's infamous feud would be reignited as Jac feels insulted that Joseph returns with her \\"sworn enemy\\" Faye. Harper concluded that with \\"acerbic one-liners flying thicker than a blizzard, it's quintessential Holby City.\\" Storylines Faye arrives at Holby General in the episode \\"Into the Dark\\", requesting that registrars Joseph Byrne and Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) help her gain employment as a Bank Nurse. During her first few months at the hospital, Faye remains close to Joseph, but does not get on well with Jac, who she speaks to sternly about her close relationship with Joseph's father, Lord Byrne (Ronald Pickup). In the episode \\"What Lies Beneath\\", flashbacks show the trio's first meeting in Dubai. Faye's husband James reveals to her that he has lost her life savings. The pair fight, and James ends up dead at the bottom of their stairs. Faye leaves him, and returns to England with Joseph and Jac. Faye is questioned by the police about James' death but is not charged. Faye begins a friendship with Ward Sister Kyla Tyson, and supports her through her domestic abuse ordeal at the hands of her husband, his subsequent death, and the loss of her son to foster care. She resists the advances of hospital lothario Sam Strachan, and impresses general surgical consultant Dan Clifford (Peter Wingfield) with her approach to patient care - leading to an on the spot promotion after a clash with Thandie Abebe (Ginny Holder) in the episode \\"Leap of Faith\\". Faye begins dating Sam, unaware that he is cheating on her with Ward Sister Chrissie Williams. She ends their relationship when she discovers his infidelity and turns her attention to Joseph, who had tried to warn her about Sam's indiscretion. She supports Joseph when he is tormented by Jac about the relationship she had had with his father prior to his death. When STI clinician Tim attacks staff members with a crossbow, Faye is shot in the back, but makes a full recovery. She reveals to Joseph that she was formerly married to a much older man named Donald, who left her a substantial amount of money after his death from cancer. She is investigated by the police, who find it suspicious that she has been twice widowed. Her stepson, Carl Hewson, blackmails her for money, but is later attacked by loan sharks and dies in theatre. Following a fight with Joseph, Faye disappears to South Africa. Joseph and consultant Linden Cullen travel there to find her, and discover that Faye has a young son, Archie, who has Lowe syndrome. He has been kidnapped by his father, Faye's first husband Lucas, and Joseph is forced to operate on him to save his life. Faye and Joseph go on to become engaged, and marry at his family home. Archie is later admitted to hospital when he accidentally swallows a whistle and he undergoes an operation to remove it and he is seemingly recovering in ICU however when nurse Lauren Minster mistakingly administers him the wrong drug Potassium, he dies. Faye is arrested for his murder when post-mortem results prove inconclusive, and is suspended from work. She is acquitted when Lauren confesses, and fights with the nurse, who attempts suicide. Faye is able to make her peace with Lauren, but is unable to fully forgive her. In the aftermath of Archie's death, Faye and Joseph grow apart, and she develops romantic feelings for Linden. Faye and Joseph separate, and she and Linden begin a relationship. Faye discovers that she is pregnant with Joseph's baby, but Linden promises to support her and they become briefly engaged. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their engagement. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is hit in the head with a glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath of Linden's death, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased younger brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit. Faye left her job on 28 December 2010 and went to live in France, leaving her son, Harry, in the care of Joseph. She returned on 3 September 2019 (series 21, episode 36, \\"The Perfect Storm\\", as a heart transplant patient. Reception Within four months of first appearing in Holby City, Kensit was nominated for the \\"Best Actress\\" award at the 2007 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards for her portrayal of Faye. The character's introductory episode, \\"Into the Dark\\" drew a high of 7 million viewers, while \\"What Lies Beneath\\", the flashback episode in which the character was seen to kill her husband in Dubai drew ratings of 6.32 million. The character's introduction to the series was highly publicised in the media, including a front cover and inside spread featuring Kensit discussing her new role in the week's edition of the Radio Times. The Liverpool Echo selected the character's introductory episode as a televisual 'Pick of the Day', The Mirror TV critic Jim Shelley selected her arrival as a highlight of the week, and Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror described her debut as \\"sensational\\". Faye has continued to generate high publicity for the series, with the 11 August 2007 edition of Total TV Guide featuring Kensit, Hobley and Chambers on its front cover, appearing in character to promote their love triangle storyline, and the 1 September 2007 Daily Express television supplement again featuring Kensit and Hobley on its cover, with an inside feature on the same storyline. It was reported on 19 August 2007 that Kensit's casting had \\"boosted the series' appeal\\" to such an extent that for the first time, a Holby City calendar had been commissioned. The report quoted a series insider as stating: \\"Patsy has really set the show off this year, and what better way to thank the dedicated fans?\\". The character was heavily criticised in the July 2007 edition of the Nursing and Midwifery Council magazine. The publication discussed the topic of nurses in popular culture, and the negative impression of the nursing profession conveyed by fictional nurses. With a promotional image of Kensit as Faye adorning the front cover, the magazine asserted: This criticism was echoed by Shelley, who, commenting on an interview Kensit had given to publicise the show and her role with Jonathan Ross, suggested that \\"reality\\" was not a term that could be applied to Holby City portrayal of nursing. In July 2009, Conservative Party strategists identified \\"Holby City woman\\" as a key voter demographic who may help the party win the 2010 General Election. The \\"Holby City woman\\" archetype is modelled on Faye, a female voter in her 30s or 40s, employed in a clinical or clerical position or some other public sector job. She is a swing voter in General Elections, who has voted for the Labour Party in previous elections, though her identification with the Labour Party is not strong. Jonathan Oliver for The Times noted that \\"Faye Morton, the Holby City staff nurse played by Patsy Kensit is just the sort of person that Cameron might now hope to recruit\\".

It is an independent, registered charitable organization.\\" Toronto’s Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art is on the move\\". James Adams, The Globe and Mail, 2 October 2012 History The museum, originally known as the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art (MOCCA), was founded from the former Art Gallery of North York in 1999. In 2005, MOCCA relocated to a repurposed textile factory in the West Queen West Art + Design District in downtown Toronto.\\"MOCA delays launch to fall, puts house in order\\". Toronto Star, Murray Whyte, 29 November 2016 The City of Toronto government funded the half- million dollar renovation of the building. In 2015, with its building about to be demolished and replaced by condominiums,\\"Is Toronto's West Queen West neighbourhood turning into the next Yorkville?\\" .

Toronto Star, 29 June 2015. At its former location on Queen West, the museum functioned as a hub for creative exchange and played a critical role in shaping the city's contemporary art scene. Through a commitment to collaborative partnerships with leading like-minded artists, organizations, institutions and festivals from Toronto and further afield, MOCCA connected the city to a national and global network of peers. MOCCA featured the work of over 1,100 Canadian and other international artists, hosted 200+ exhibitions and welcomed 40,000 annual visitors. As the lease on Queen West wound down, the need to move provided an opportunity to seek a larger space that could accommodate the museum's ever-growing aspirations and significance. In September 2018, the museum was moved to the Tower Automotive Building. In 2016, the museum changed its name to the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto Canada (MOCA). In September 2018, MOCA moved into a 55,000 square foot purpose-designed home in a former industrial space at the heart of a new neighbourhood in the Lower Junction. The museum received funding from the Canada Cultural Spaces Fund. The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Ontario Museum Association and the Ontario Association of Art Galleries. Award During its time on Queen Street West, the museum presented the MOCCA Award in Contemporary Art. In 2010, the award was given to Edward Burtynsky.\\"Edward Burtynsky gifts photos to Vancouver Art Gallery\\". CBC News, 18 February 2014 Exhibits The museum's former Queen Street West location featured two large exhibition spaces, a Main Space and a Project Room. More than 80 exhibits and projects were presented in this space, involving about 800 artists, including Suzy Lake and Kris Knight.\\"Dean Baldwin and MOCCA turned a museum into a yacht club\\".

It was founded during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush of 1859 and was involved in the mining industry, both as a supply hub and as a gold ore processing center beginning in the 1890s. Residents of Colorado City worked at some of the 50 coal mines of the Colorado Springs area. It was briefly the capital of the Colorado Territory. For many years, Colorado Springs prohibited the use of alcohol within its border due to the lifestyle of Colorado City's opium dens, bordellos, and saloons. It is now a tourist area, with boutiques, art galleries, and restaurants. Etymology Garden of the Gods formations It was initially and briefly known as El Dorado for the gold mines found during the gold rush. The name Colorado City was selected by its founders because of the red sandstone rocks and red outcroppings in the vicinity (specifically, the Rampart Range and Garden of the Gods formations). The word Colorado in Spanish means \\"blushing\\" or \\"red\\". Geography The approximate boundaries are U.S. Highway 24 to the south, 32nd Street to the west, 13th Street to the east and Uintah Street to the north, with the town square restructured as Bancroft Park. History =Founded= Colorado City Town Company laid claim to two square miles of land that would become Colorado City on May 22, 1859. Founded at the confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks on August 13, 1859, it was the first Pikes Peak region settlement. The founders— Melancthon Beach, Anthony Bott, George Bute, and Rufus Cable—envisioned Colorado City as a major supply hub for the new gold mines in South Park and the Blue River, where major strikes in the Pike's Peak Gold Rush had recently been made. The location for the town was selected for its proximity to Ute Pass, the route westward to the gold mines. With In 1859, Colorado City was in the most westerly part of Kansas Territory. The Colorado City area became part of the Jefferson Territory on October 24, 1859. There were more than 300 cabins that had been built by 1861. Its residents included ranchers, farmers, freighters, and outfitters for gold prospectors. =Territorial capital and county seat= Former El Paso County courthouse, Old Colorado City Colorado Territory was established on November 5, 1861. Until August 14, 1862 (including one legislative session), the city was the Colorado Territory capital until it was moved to Golden. Colorado City effectively functioned as the capital for only five days. When the second territorial legislature met at Colorado City on July 7, 1862, in a log cabin that still stands on Colorado Avenue, they found the accommodations so inadequate that they voted to adjourn on July 11 and reconvene in Denver on July 16. El Paso County was formed in 1861 and Colorado City was the county seat until 1873, when the courthouse moved to Colorado Springs. =Saloons and bordellos= For the first two decades, the population of the town decreased. Some people chose to farm or ranch outside of the town limits. In addition, the town did not get the travelers it anticipated because most people chose to travel through Denver due to skirmishes with Native Americans along the Arkansas River. Its primary interest was as a \\"watering hole\\", due to its many saloons on the south side of Colorado Avenue. There were brothels and gambling rooms on upper floors of the saloons and brothels behind the saloons on Cucharras Street. Tunnels under Colorado Avenue ensured that men could enter these businesses without being seen. In addition to saloons and brothels, Colorado City had opium dens in its early days. When William Jackson Palmer purchased the land for Colorado Springs, he outlawed the consumption of alcohol within the new town's borders in reaction to the businesses he found unsavory in Colorado City. In 1896 and until 1916, ordinances were passed that prohibited prostitution, opium dens, and dance halls, but brothels continued to be established after 1896. The mayor of the town had warned prostitutes to leave Colorado City by 1908 or 1909, when most of the red-light district was burned down in two separate fires. Between 1902 and 1909, there were other fires along Saloon Row and the red light district. Liquor was outlawed in Colorado City in 1916. For the bordellos that rebuilt or remained, they received continued pressure to close down until Colorado City was annexed to Colorado Springs in 1917. At that time, at least one owner, Laura Bell McDaniel, was arrested. In 1933, at the end of Prohibition, Colorado Springs lifted the ban of the sale and consumption of alcohol. =Coal miners= Coal was mined in Colorado Springs beginning in 1859. At the industry's height, there were 50 coal mines in the Colorado Springs, mostly in the Rockrimmon and Cragmor - Colorado Springs Country Club area. Mine workers often lived on the west side of town, like Old Colorado City, while investors lived in the Old North End. =Transportation= Historic trails and roads Roads into the area included a toll road that connected to the northeast with the Overland's 1865 \\"Despatch Express Route\\". Southward out of Colorado City a stage road (now Old Stage Road) traversed through South Cheyenne Creek's canyon to Cripple Creek, and a carriage road through North and South Cheyenne Canyons and westward was the Ute Pass Wagon Road. Another route into the area was the north–south Cherokee Trail / Jimmy Camp Trail, which was near the Goodnight–Loving Trail. The Jimmy Camp Trail was one branch of the Trapper's Trail, a trail used by trappers and explorers from 1820 and during the gold rush. Trapper's Trail ran north–south from Fort Laramie to the El Pueblo trading post in the present Pueblo County, and from there branched off to Bent's Old Fort or Taos, New Mexico. Railroad spurs growth In 1883, the Colorado Midland Railroad came to Colorado City, with its operating and administrative headquarters in the town. Industries located in and around town to take advantage of the convenient rail access. The industries that generated thousands of jobs included ore processing mills, Ute Pass Paint Factory, Colorado City Glass Works, and Hassell Iron Works. Banks, restaurants, rooming houses, offices, meeting halls and other supporting commercial establishments were built along the north side of Colorado Avenue between Court and 26th Street. The town's workforce also included railroad workers. =Supply hub and processing mills= Major gold strikes were made west of Colorado City during the Cripple Creek Gold Rush in the 1890s. The town grew as ore was sent to the town to be processed and prospectors came to purchase supplies and for amusement. Ore processing mills were established in Colorado City in the 1890s. Eventually Colorado City was processing much of the gold ore mined at Cripple Creek. There were four processing companies in Colorado City before 1912. Golden Cycle Mill had a better reduction process and by 1912 the other mills had ceased to operate. Colorado City was the location of a 1903 strike that spread to Cripple Creek and eventually led to the Colorado Labor Wars. In the 1910s, a reduction in demand for the railroad and ore processing mills depressed Colorado City's economy. =Annexation= Part of Old Colorado City was annexed in 1898. It was finally incorporated into Colorado Springs in 1917 and called West Colorado Springs, or more popularly, the West Side. =Historic district= City Hall of Old Colorado City, built in 1892 Since the mid-1970s, Old Colorado City had been part of private and public revitalization efforts, including capturing the historical character of its buildings, burying utility wires, and landscaping. Buildings have been painted colors used around the turn of the 20th century, modern signs have been replaced or removed, and architectural details have been exposed. In 1982, the Old Colorado Historic Commercial District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It includes 27 properties situated primarily along Colorado Avenue between 24th and 26th streets and some additional properties on Court Street and the block between 26th and 27th streets. One-story frame and brick buildings are the earliest known style of construction. Western Victorian, turn-of-the-century commercial buildings are the second style. These structures are generally two-story, red brick structures with Queen Anne, Romanesque Revival and Italianate style architecture. Bancroft Park is located within the district. It includes a bandshell, pavilion and early pioneer cabin. =Modern history= Old Colorado City has a shopping district featuring art galleries, boutiques, restaurants, and tourist shops. Special attractions include Simpich Showcase and Magic Town at The Michael Garman Museum and Gallery.

Biography Cullen was born in Tenerife, Canary Islands, but moved to Argentina in the 1820s after establishing commercial activities (linked with fluvial trade) in the area. He met Santa Fe's caudillo Estanislao López when serving as a deputy of the Cabildo of Montevideo. After being involved in activism related to the independence of Uruguay and the resistance against Brazil (see Cisplatine War), he returned to Santa Fe, settled in a ranch, and married Joaquina Rodríguez del Fresno, the young widow of Pedro Aldao and sister-in-law of López. In 1828 he became a counselor of López, and his Minister of Government in 1833. At the time of López's death on 15 June 1838, Cullen was in Buenos Aires as representative of Santa Fe, trying to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing French blockade of the port (caused by a law of 1821 that obligated resident foreign citizens of the province of Buenos Aires to serve in conscription).Historia General de las Relaciones Exteriores de la República Argentina. Cap. 20: Los bloqueos francés y anglofrancés. Cullen argued that the blockade was the result of a provincial law and therefore the other provinces were not bound to help Buenos Aires. Juan Manuel de Rosas, the powerful governor of Buenos Aires, contended that this violated the Federal Pact. When Cullen returned to Santa Fe, he became governor, but his election was not acknowledged by Rosas and by Pascual Echagüe, governor of the neighbouring Entre Ríos Province. Without López's support, he faced opposition from his personal enemies in the province and from those loyals to Rosas. In the end, all provinces including Santa Fe ended up supporting Buenos Aires against the French, and Cullen was forced to resign and go to exile. Accused of conspiring with the Unitarians (enemies of Rosas) and the French, he sought asylum in Santiago del Estero, but he was betrayed by his host and delivered to Rosas's men, to be tried in Buenos Aires. However, right after crossing the Arroyo del Medio and entering the territory of Buenos Aires Province, his captors announced they had orders to kill him. Cullen was assisted by a priest in San Nicolás de los Arroyos and wrote a letter to his wife; he was then killed by a firing squad, on 21 June 1839. He was buried in the spot. In 1840 the army of General Juan Lavalle passed by the place on its way to Santa Fe, and Cullen's body was exhumed at the request of Pedro Rodríguez del Fresno, an officer of Lavalle's and Cullen's brother-in- law. He was taken to the Convent of Saint Dominic in Santa Fe, where they remain today, next to the bodies of his son Patricio and several other important leaders. Domingo Cullen at Todo-Argentina.net.Un santafesino en la fundación del Club del Progreso: José María Cullen. Descent Cullen's family was of Irish origin, descended from Thomas Cullen Maher, who emigrated from Kilkenny to the Canary Islands in 1793. Domingo Cullen (full name: Domingo Alejandro Lorenzo Cullen y Ferraz), born in Tenerife, was Cullen Maher's third grandson, the son of Guillermo Felipe Cullen and Ángela Isidra Ferraz de la Guardia. Cullen emigrated to the Río de la Plata region, first settling in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1811, and moving then to Santa Fe in 1823. This Argentine branch of the family has given Santa Fe many influential characters in the field of politics. Cullen Family in Argentina . Cullen Reunion 2007 . Domingo Cullen at IrishGenealogy.com.ar. Domingo Cullen, as depicted by J. Zorrila de San Martín Cullen had seven children. José María Cullen, his firstborn, and Patricio Cullen, his second son, both served as governors of Santa Fe (Tomás Cullen, his last son, was also ad interim governor). His third child, Joaquina, was the wife of Nicasio Oroño, governor and political chief of Rosario, and the fourth, Josefa, was married to Juan María Gutiérrez Granados, member of the Constitutional Assembly that crafted the Argentine Constitution of 1853.

Hawkers (peddlers) were often frowned upon by the law, but book peddlers were treated differently. For example, in laws of Massachusetts and Missouri that imposed penalties for hawkers operating without license, the book peddlers were excluded.Emert v.

In addition to the initial goal of peddling the Christian literature, they started to arrange religious discussion meetings. Eventually the activities of the society were frowned upon by the administration of the Russian Church for their independence and liberalism and closeness to the Tolstoyans. After various restrictions put forth by the infamous Ober-Procurator of the Holy Synod Konstantin Pobedonostsev, the activity of the society dwindled. The Seventh-day Adventists, persecuted in Russia, employed colportage of literature published abroad and smuggled into Russia, under the threat of arrest, fine, and confiscation.Seventh Day Adventists in Russia Japan The tradition of book peddling traces back to the Edo period.

The Mark 13 design was based on the earlier Mark 6 nuclear bomb design, which was in turn based on the Mark 4 nuclear bomb and the Mark 3 nuclear bomb used at the end of World War II. Description The Mark 13 bomb was nearly the same size as the Mark 6 nuclear bomb it was developed from; 61 inches in diameter and 128 inches long (150 cm by 320 cm), weighing 7,400 lb (3,300 kg). The W-13 warhead was somewhat smaller, being roughly 58 inches in diameter and 100 inches long, with a 6,000 to 6,500 lb weight (145 cm by 250 cm, 2,700 kg to 2,900 kg).Complete list of all US nuclear weapons, Carey Sublette, at the nuclearweaponarchive.org website. Accessed April 17, 2007. The Mark 13 design used a 92-point nuclear implosion system (see Nuclear weapon design). A similar 92-point system was used in later variants of the Mark 6 weapon. Testing The Mark 13 nuclear bomb design was tested at least once, in the Operation Upshot–Knothole Harry test shot conducted on May 19, 1953. The estimated yield of this test was 32 kilotons. Deployment As the Mark 13 neared production, advances in thermonuclear weapon design, particularly the Ivy Mike thermonuclear test in November 1952, made the Mark 13 obsolete. Development continued for research purposes (the Upshot-Knothole Harry test shot came months after the first thermonuclear test in Ivy Mike), and in two variant designs, but the Mark 13 proper was never deployed. The Mark 13 bomb version was cancelled in August 1953, and the W-13 warhead version was cancelled in September 1953. Variants =Mark 18= The Mark 18 nuclear bomb also known as the Super Oralloy Bomb (or its initials SOB) utilized the 92-point Mark 13 implosion system, but a different fissile core with around 60 kilograms of highly enriched uranium (Oralloy). This was the largest pure fission nuclear bomb ever tested, with a yield of more than 500 kilotons. The Mark 18 was produced in moderate quantities (90 units) and in service from 1953 to 1956. =Mark 20= The Mark 20 nuclear bomb was a planned successor to the Mark 13 incorporating some improvements in its design. Research was halted at the same time as the Mark 13. The Mark 20 was the same size as the Mark 13, but weighed only 6,400 lb.

The Hōzanji Line is the oldest commercially operated funicular in Japan, opened in 1918. It runs to Hōzan-ji, a Shingon Buddhist temple. Sanjō Line climbs up Mount Ikoma, reaching Ikoma Sanjo Amusement Park. The Hōzanji Line is the only double-track funicular in the country. However, the two tracks are treated as different lines, called and . Normally, only Hōzanji Line 1 and Sanjō Line are used. Hōzanji Line 2 is operated in holiday seasons, and for safety inspections of the Line 1. Since the Hōzanji Line runs along a fairly urbanized area, it also functions as a commuter line. However, the line does not accept PiTaPa, a smart card ticketing system, nor Surutto Kansai, a prepaid magnetic card ticketing system.

WNNO is a sister station to WDLS AM 900. Its station is located in the vacation mecca of Wisconsin Dells and Lake Delton, and its signal can be reached out to Portage, Poynette, Baraboo, Lyndon Station, and Adams- Friendship, as well as the northern tier of the Madison Metro area. History The construction permit for this station was obtained as WQRH in February 1973. Owned by Obed S. Borgen, it and its sister station WWDA AM 990 were sold to the Taylor Electric Company late in the year; the call letters were changed to WNNO-AM-FM before the FM signed on. After having been established in a trailer located at the transmitter site along Highway 23, about three miles outside of Wisconsin Dells—where listeners passing by would occasionally honk their horns, to which the on-air jocks would acknowledge the \\"neighbors driving by\\"—new studios were built at 721 Superior Street in downtown Wisconsin Dells, where they would stay for the next 28 years. John Taylor was the station GM, and the WNNO-FM format was Top 40 hits. The station simulcast with WNNO AM. The station was sold to Voss Radio, Inc. in 1977 and continued to simulcast Top 40 hits with WNNO-AM, which had now changed frequency to AM 900. The format changed to “Memory Music” in late 1983-1985 and Chicago Cubs games were also broadcast during this period. Voss sold the station to Armada Broadcasting in 1985, and the format was changed back to simulcasting Top 40 hits. Mutual news was dropped and the emphasis was on more local events. One of the principal owners of Armada is the nephew of radio legend Gary Owens, and Gary's liners for WNNO could be heard on-air at this time. During the early- to mid-90s, WNNO-FM was a Top-40 station, while WNNO AM simulcast WNNO-FM or was off the air. WNNO and WNNO-FM had studios together on Superior Street in Wisconsin Dells and would usually be on the air from 6AM-midnight. In the late 1990s WNNO-AM-FM were purchased by Magnum Radio Group and studios were moved to Church Street in Wisconsin Dells. By this time, WNNO AM had become a simulcast of WIBU/1240 Poynette/Portage, which aired Jones Radio Networks' Classic Hit Country format at the time. The calls of WNNO AM were changed to WDLS, which is now a classic country station; concurrently, WNNO-FM became Hot AC under the name \\"Mix 106\\", also using programming from Jones Radio Networks (Now Dial Global).

His other film credits include a feature film version of Hamlet (with Pyros playing the eponymous lead, Prince Hamlet), directed by Oscar Redding which had its world premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival. His performance was critically acclaimed. Alison Croggon, writing in The Australian Newspaper said, 'crucially, Redding has a brilliant Hamlet in Richard Pyros. There are times when his performance lifts the hair on the back of your neck: this Hamlet might be mad, but the method in it has a profound legibility, and his corrosive intelligence shines through every gesture.'

José Gustavo Guerrero (26 June 1876 - 25 October 1958), was a Salvadoran diplomat and jurist. He was President of the Assembly of the League of Nations from 1929 to 1930. He served as the last president of the Permanent Court of International Justice from 1937 to 1945; he was also the first president of the International Court of Justice (\\"World Court\\") from 1946 to 1949, and remained on the Court as a regular judge until his death in 1958.  World War II  Jose Gustavo Guerrero was a Salvadoran judge who challenged the Nazis during Hitler's invasion on Europe. The distinguished Salvadoran jurist lived in Europe for many years in his career as a diplomat and as presiding judge of the Permanent Court of Justice International, based in The Hague, The Netherlands. In 1937, during the rise of Nazism in Europe, Doctor Guerrero took over as president, until he was forced to leave in 1940 by the Nazis. Precisely after the fall of Holland, on May 17, 1940, the Nazis tried to take the Palace of the Permanent Court of Justice in The Hague, but there they met the Salvadoran, the only judge who stayed with a group of Dutch officers. When a German general approached, the Presiding Judge told him: \\"The Court and its staff are inviolable. Only on my body can they enter the palace.\\" For this and others before courage in defense of Universal Law, Dr. Guerrero was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Once established in Geneva, Dr. Guerrero was visited by the Consul General of El Salvador in Switzerland, Colonel José Castellanos Contreras, who had fled from Germany, where he served as Consul until El Salvador broke relations with the Hitler regime. Colonel Castellanos had already granted several visas to people of Jewish origin who were persecuted by the Nazis. However, now it was part of a larger project: the handing over of false documents of Salvadoran nationality to people of Jewish origin Castellanos then consulted Dr. Guerrero, who immediately agreed to that plan that saved the lives of thousands of Jews. According to the investigations, Dr. Guerrero would have contributed to writing the text of the document that was then given to them to save their lives. In 1945 San Francisco, California, a conference was held attended by more than 50 countries and on which the United Nations Organization (UN) was founded.

The similar concept of transmigration has been used frequently to the point of cliché in the sense of people \\"switching bodies,\\" in which the identity of a character transfers to another's body, either unilaterally or by exchange (e.g. Vice Versa), or to an animal (e.g. The Once and Future King) or object (e.g. The Picture of Dorian Gray). This concept has been used many times in various films, particularly in Indian cinema and television. Literature Metempsychosis is the title of a work by the metaphysical poet John Donne, written in 1601.Collins, Siobhán (2005) \\"Bodily Formations and Reading Strategies in John Donne's Metempsychosis\\" Critical Studies 26: pp. 191-208, page 191 The poem, also known as the Infinitati Sacrum,full text of Metempsychosis or Infinitati Sacrum from Luminarium Editions consists of two parts, the \\"Epistle\\" and \\"The Progress of the Soule\\". In the first line of the latter part, Donne writes that he \\"sing[s] of the progresse of a deathlesse soule\\". During the classical period of German literature, metempsychosis attracted much attention: Goethe played with the idea, and it was taken up more seriously by Lessing, who borrowed it from Charles Bonnet, and by Herder. Reincarnation is a key plot device in Edgar Allan Poe's 1832 short story \\"Metzengerstein',Bonaparte, Marie (1949) The life and works of Edgar Allan Poe: a psycho-analytic interpretation Imago, London, page 273, in his \\"Morella\\" (1835)Roderick, Phillip L.

(1971) The French face of Edgar Poe (2nd edition) Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, Illinois, page 272, Mark Twain mentions this concept in \\"A Word of Explanation\\" at the beginning of his \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.\\" He comes across a \\"curious stranger\\" at Warwick Castle in England who shows him ancient armor that supposedly once belonged to the knights of the Round Table. He interrupts his musings by saying: \\"You know about transmigration of souls; do you know about transposition of epochs -- and bodies?\\" He later claims to have killed one of the knights himself ... with a bullet! Metempsychosis recurs as a theme in James Joyce's modernist novel, Ulysses (1920). In Joycean fashion, the word famously appears, mispronounced by Molly Bloom, as \\"met him pike hoses.\\"Cf. Joyce, Ulysses, §8 Lestrygonians J. D. Salinger's short story \\"Teddy\\" (Nine Stories 1953) concerns reincarnation. An examination of transmigration in the arts is Philip K. Dick's novel The Transmigration of Timothy Archer. The bestselling suspense reincarnation series of M. J. Rose inspired the FOX-TV series Past Life, Chuck Palahniuk's book Diary centers around an artist whose reincarnated soul is repeatedly used in order to keep the residents of an island rich. American author Suzanne Weyn's 2008 romance novel, Reincarnation, follows two lovers who keep searching for one another as they progress through the centuries. The Power of Five series by Anthony Horowitz involves children from 8000 B.C. returning as ordinary 21st century children.

The name came from Dionysus, the Greek god of ecstatic states, particularly those produced by wine, which is sometimes said to be derived from the Greek Dios (Διός, \\"of Zeus\\") and Nysos or Nysa (Νῦσα), where the young god was raised. Dionysus (or Dionysos; also known as Bacchus in Roman mythology and associated with the Italic Liber), the Thracian god of wine, represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but also its social and beneficent influences. He is viewed as the promoter of civilization, a lawgiver, and lover of peace—as well as the patron deity of both agriculture and the theater. Dionysus is a god of mystery religious rites, such as those practiced in honor of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis near Athens. In the Thracian mysteries, he wears the \\"bassaris\\" or fox-skin, symbolizing new life. (See also Maenads.) A mediaeval Latinised form of the Anglo-Norman surname Le Denys was Dacus, which correctly meant Dacian, but when the Vikings were about was often used to mean \\"Danish\\" or \\"The Dane\\". The name became modernised as Denys, then later as Dennis. Alternative forms and spellings of the name include Denis, Denys, Dennys, Denish, Deon, Deonne, Deonte, and Dion, Dionice. Diminutive forms include Den, Dennoh, Deno, Denny, Deny and Deen. The name Sydenie (alternate spellings: Sydney or Sidney) may derive from a village in Normandy called Saint-Denis. A medieval diminutive was Dye, from which the names Dyson and Tyson are derived. Dennis is a very popular English, Irish and Danish name, common throughout the English-speaking world. Denis is a very popular French name, common throughout the Francophone world, but is also a common English, Irish, German, Italian, Dutch, Croatian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian, Brazilian, Bosnian, and Albanian name. Dionizy is the Polish version of the name. Deniz is the Turkish version of the name. The Turkish language word for \\"sea\\" is \\"deniz\\", e.g. Kara Deniz means the Black Sea. Dionigi and Dionisio are the Italian versions of the name. The Irish name Donnchadh may be anglicised as Denis, but has a different origin and is in fact related to the name Duncan. Feminine versions of the name include: Denise, Denisa, Deni, Denice, Deniece, Dione, and Dionne.

He last played with the Chiba Lotte Marines, and played in the major leagues with the New York Mets in 2002. Biography Komiyama was a star on the Waseda University college baseball team, and was drafted by the Lotte Orions (current Chiba Lotte Marines) in the first round in 1989. He won 6 games as a rookie in 1990, and won 10 games in 1992, becoming the team's ace. He would be the opening-day starter for three consecutive years after this. In 1997, he won only 11 games, but recorded a 2.49 ERA, the best in the league. The Marines cut Komiyama in 1999, and he signed with the Yokohama BayStars, playing two seasons where he posted ERA's under 4.00 as a starter. He became a free agent, and signed with the New York Mets in 2002, but returned to Japan after the season. He spent 2003 in semi-retirement, working as a baseball commentator while continuing his training. He returned to the Chiba Lotte Marines in 2004, but was mostly unable to repeat his performances from earlier in his career with the team. However, he still managed to contribute to the team's championship in 2005, mostly pitching in long relief. In 2007, he revealed that he would throw pitches under-handed (submarine) as well as his usual over-handed form. Komiyama has appeared as a baseball commentator numerous times, even though he is still an active player. He was rumored to start the 2007 season doubling as a relief pitcher and a pitching coach, but he has announced that he will not coach until after he has retired. Pitching style Komiyama was never regarded as a truly dominating starter, even in the Japanese leagues, as he never won more than 12 games in a season. He posted an ERA below 3.00 in two of his seasons in Japan, but won only 11 games in both those years, and he has more losses than wins in his career. Komiyama has been known to experiment with various pitches during the off- season, and his most recent pitch, the \\"shakeball\\" (a variant of the knuckleball only reaching 50~60 mph, or 80~90 km/h) has been somewhat successful against batters. In his prime, he mostly relied on good control and outsmarting hitters. His fastball falls in the mid 80 mph range, but he has a large assortment of pitches, and has used a slider, curve, splitter, changeup, cutter, sinker, and shootball at various points in his career.

Shiroo Murder of Iccho Itoh On April 17, 2007, Shiroo shot Iccho Itoh, the mayor of Nagasaki, who died early the next morning. Shiroo's apparent motive for the assassination was a grudge over an insurance claim. City officials had refused to compensate him for a Yamaguchi-gumi vehicle that was damaged at a public works construction site in 2003. It was reported in the Japanese press that prior to the shooting, Shiroo had mailed a letter to TV Asahi outlining his grudges against the mayor and the city government. In addition to the insurance claim, Shiroo was also reportedly angry that a construction company linked to his gang had been denied a contract by the city government. He later told police that he had been planning the assassination since February. Shiroo approached Itoh at 7:50 pm outside his campaign office near Nagasaki Station, shooting him twice in the back with an American-made revolver. Local police quickly subdued and arrested Shiroo, who reportedly later told police that he had planned to commit suicide after killing the mayor. Shiroo was indicted by the Nagasaki District Public Prosecutor's office for murder, gun possession and obstruction of election campaigning. Two of Shiroo's associates, Hiromi Ogawa and Masaki Yamashita, were arrested for helping Shiroo plan the killing, but charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence. Shiroo denied that he had told anyone of his plans to assassinate Itoh. Police sources stated that the killing was a result of this personal grudge, and was not authorized by the Yamaguchi-gumi leadership. After the mayor's death, Shiroo's gang, the Suishin-kai, announced that it would voluntarily disband. Legal proceedings and conviction His trial began on January 22, 2008. Prosecutors sought capital punishment for him and he was sentenced to death on May 26, 2008. However, the Fukuoka High Court revoked the death sentence and sentenced him to life imprisonment on September 29, 2009.

He was a tutor of his nephew, General Morazán. In 1820 he occupied his first public office, as secretary of the town government of Tegucigalpa. On 16 September 1824 he became the first head of state of Honduras, after the independence of Central America from Spain and from Mexico. Colonel José Justo Milla was his vice-head of state. During his term he decreed the first territorial subdivisions of Honduras, creating the departments of Comayagua, Tegucigalpa, Santa Bárbara, Yoro, Olancho and Choluteca (department). He also promulgated the first constitution of the country (state), on 11 December 1825. The government of Herrera was overthrown on 10 May 1827 in a coup d'état led by Colonel Milla and aided by Honduran Conservatives.

He exercised this office until November 1833, relying on the support of General Morazán. He tried to implement various Liberal reforms, but unsuccessfully, due to the opposition of the clergy. In 1835 he was elected head of state of El Salvador, but he declined the office. In 1838 he retired from politics, working as a teacher in the city of San Vicente, El Salvador.

A former linebacker at Florida State University, he began his coaching career in 1981. He has now coached for 36 years across college and the NFL. Herring arrived in Denver to coach linebackers in 2015 after previous stops in the league with Chicago (2014), Houston (2002-03, ’11-13) and Dallas (2008-10). Herring has coached nine linebackers who have made Pro Bowl appearances during their careers, including outside linebackers DeMarcus Ware (9), Mario Williams (4), and Connor Barwin (1), and inside linebackers Zach Thomas (7), Keith Brooking (5), Lance Briggs (7), Brian Cushing (1), Sean Lee (2) and DeMeco Ryans (2). Herring also served as the interim head football coach for the University of Arkansas in the 2008 Cotton Bowl Classic. College career Herring played at Florida State University from 1978 to 1980, earning his bachelor's degree in criminology. As a player, he was a three-year starting linebacker, leading the team in tackles for three consecutive years. His 452 total tackles in his career ranks him third all-time for tackles in Florida State history and his 170 tackles during his 1980 senior season also ranks him third on the single-season tackle list. During his career with the Florida State Seminoles, he played in two Orange Bowls and one Tangerine Bowl, serving as team captain for the 1980 team that made it to the Orange Bowl. His final two years at FSU, the Seminoles finished 11–1 and 10–2 and ranked in the top 10 in the final AP poll. In 1989, Herring was inducted into the Florida State Hall of Fame. Coaching career =Early career= Herring first served as a graduate assistant coach at Oklahoma State University in 1981 under head coach Jimmy Johnson. After one year, Johnson promoted Herring to coach OSU's linebackers, a position that he would hold until 1985. During this time, Herring worked with quarterbacks coach Houston Nutt, under whom Herring would later serve as defensive coordinator at the University of Arkansas. In 1986, Herring left OSU to coach linebackers at Auburn University under head coach Pat Dye. At Auburn, Herring helped lead the Tigers to three consecutive SEC titles from 1987 to 1989. In 1992, Herring was offered his first defensive coordinator position, though he continued to coach linebackers, at Texas Christian University. After two years at TCU, Herring left to coach linebackers at Clemson University. Herring was promoted to defensive coordinator for the Tigers for the 1997 season, and held that position through the 2001 season. The Tigers made six bowl appearances during that stretch as seven of Herring’s linebackers were selected in the NFL Draft. In 2002, Herring accepted a position in the NFL with the Houston Texans to coach linebackers, after having been on the job as defensive coordinator at Ole Miss for less than a month.http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=200350http://www.houstontexans.com/news/Transactions2000_2002.asp?print=yes Although Herring only held the Texans position for two years, he coached the 2003 league-leader in tackles, Jamie Sharper. In 2004, Herring left the NFL to become defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at North Carolina State University. In his first year at North Carolina State, the Wolfpack defense led the nation in total defense after ranking 89th in that category the year prior. =Arkansas= In 2005, Herring left North Carolina State for a defensive coordinator position with Houston Nutt at the University of Arkansas. At Arkansas, Herring improved the Razorback defense in almost every statistical category. In the 2006 season, Herring led a defense ranked 44th out of 119 Division I-A FBS teams.Ranking Summary For his performance in the 2006 season, Herring was a finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually the nation's top assistant coach in college football. On November 26, 2007, after Houston Nutt was forced to resign, Herring was announced as the interim coach of the Razorbacks for the Cotton Bowl Classic.Statement from Arkansas Interim Head Coach Reggie Herring - University of Arkansas Athletics The 24th-ranked Razorbacks lost the game 38–7 to 7th-ranked Missouri. He had said about the Capital One Bowl that his team needed to \\"...punch Mickey Mouse in the mouth.\\"http://nfldraft.rivals.com/barrier_noentry.asp?ReturnTo=&sid;=1164&script;=content.asp&cid;=619613&fid;=&tid;=∣=&rid;= =Texas A&M;= On January 4, 2008, Herring was named the defensive coordinator at Texas A&M; by head coach Mike Sherman. Herring took part in the Aggies' 2008 recruiting, and resigned after National Signing Day to return to the NFL and become the linebackers coach at the Dallas Cowboys. =Dallas Cowboys= Herring was hired by the Dallas Cowboys on February 8, 2008. He worked as the team's linebacker position coach under head coach Wade Phillips. With the help of his tutelage, the Cowboys led the NFL in quarterback sacks (59) during the 2008 season.http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?tabSeq=2&statisticCategory;=SACKS&conference;=ALL&role;=OPP&season;=2008&seasonType;=REG As linebackers coach for Dallas from 2008-10, Herring helped outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware deliver the most productive three-season stretch of his career. =Houston Texans= Herring joined new Houston Texans defensive coordinator Wade Phillips in January 2011. Herring coached in his second stint with the Texans from 2011-13. He was part of a staff that helped turn the league’s 30th-ranked defensive unit into a group that ranked fourth overall (308.8 ypg) during his three years with the club. =Chicago Bears= Herring joined Marc Trestman's coaching staff as Chicago Bears linebackers coach on January 22, 2014. However, he was released by the team on January 20, 2015. =Denver Broncos= Herring joined Gary Kubiak's coaching staff as Denver Broncos linebackers coach on January 26, 2015. Herring helped Denver’s defensive transition to a 3-4 alignment in 2015. On February 7, 2016, Herring was part of the Broncos coaching staff that won Super Bowl 50. In the game, the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers by a score of 24–10. Coaching Denver’s inside linebackers for the last three seasons, Herring helped lead a defense that allowed a league-low 296.4 yards per game during that span. Personal life Herring is married to the former Lisa Ward of Griffin, Georgia. The couple has a daughter, Caroline, and a son, Adam, who is a former linebacker on the Auburn football team and now coaches at University of Texas at Austin.

History The Teifi Valley Railway was originally conceived as a broad-gauge line between Carmarthen and Cardigan. The line was opened temporarily in 1860, under the South Wales Railway and was fully opened the following year. It was operated by the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway between Carmarthen and Cynwyl Elfed. In 1864, the line was extended to Pencader and Llandysul. By 1872 it had been converted to standard gauge () but, by now, the line was bankrupt. Bought by the Great Western Railway, it extended the terminus to Newcastle Emlyn in 1895, The GWR saw no point in developing the line beyond this point and so it became a terminus. Passenger services ceased in 1952, but goods services continued to run due in part to milk train services to the Co-operative Group creamery. Co-located at the station, later owned by Dried Milk Products it latterly produced cheese. Freight services continued until 1973. Present After the cessation of freight services, the lines were removed and the station demolished. Today there is no sign of the station and the site has been redeveloped as a garage. The Teifi Valley Railway, taking its name from what the old line was called locally, is a narrow gauge steam/diesel visitor attraction which runs part way to Newcastle Emlyn from its base at Henllan. Extension of its line into Newcastle Emlyn will require rebuilding of a bridge over the River Teifi which had been demolished following storm damage in 1987.

Following closure, the station building and signal box were demolished, leaving behind only a bare platform. In 1978, the Gwili Railway re-opened the station and gradually rebuilt the station building and signal box using redundant buildings recovered from the Heart of Wales Line. The station building was constructed from Llandovery signal box, clad with components from Ammanford (GWR) railway station, while the signal box from Llandybie was also recovered and is now used as the 'new' Bronwydd Arms signal box. A third box from central Wales, Ffairfach, is also in use as a museum. Other smaller items have been incorporated into the rebuilt station, such as Great Western Railway lamp posts and benches, a parcels shed and a water tower, recovered from Barry Docks in 1979. The station features a level crossing with wooden gates at the south end where the railway crosses the B4301 road. Passenger trains now currently use the crossing which had been brought into use as part of the railway's extension to Abergwili Junction. In 2010 the level crossing was renewed to enable the original two-gate system to be re-instated in GWR style, thus re-creating another feature of the original station.

Of apparent magnitude 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, it is located 5.2 degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini. It is only visible as a disc at magnifications over 200-fold. The nebula was discovered by astronomer Ralph Copeland in 1883. The central star has a stellar class of WC4 and is hydrogen deficient with an effective temperature of 76-. The distance to this nebula is not known accurately, but is estimated to be around . This planetary nebular has a slightly elliptical form, a complex structure, and a ring that is somewhat broken. It shows a typical abundance of carbon and a slightly enhanced nitrogen abundance. Radial velocity studies indicate that the star may be a member of a binary system. The nebula does not show enrichment of s-process elements. This suggests that the star's asymptotic giant branch stage may have been truncated by interaction with the companion. Alternatively, the star may be low in mass and did not undergo third dredge- up, or the star's s-process elements were heavily diluted by the envelope during the AGB phase.

Her relationship with and marriage to Fox was one of the most famous and controversial of their age.  Early life  Elizabeth Armistead was born Elizabeth Bridget Cane on 11 July 1750. Later items in The Public Advertiser and Town and Country Magazine reported her place of birth as Greenwich, London, and her parentage as variously a market porter and an herb-vendor or a shoemaker turned Methodist lay preacher, but biographer I. M. Davis gives such accounts little credence.Davis, I. M., 1986, The Harlot and the Statesman, The Kensal Press, Samuel Rogers believed she had once been a waiting woman to actress Fanny Abington.Rogers, Samuel, 1859, Recollections, London. The reasons for her changing her maiden name to Armistead or Armitstead are unknown.Levy 2004. She began her career in an exclusive, high-class brothel in London, though which one is uncertain. An entry in Sir Joshua Reynolds's appointment books for 1771 includes a marginal annotation, \\"Mrs Armistead at Mrs Mitchell's, Upper John Street, Soho Square\\". Together with Charlotte Hayes and Jane Goadby, Elizabeth Mitchell was one of the most infamous brothel- keepers of the time.Rubenhold, Hallie. The Covent Garden Ladies. Tempus Publishing, 2005 (See Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies, a description of prostitutes of that era, for context.) It was perhaps at one such establishment that Armistead met her first documented patron, Frederick St John, 2nd Viscount Bolingbroke. Many years later, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, recalled how he and a group of young friends, including Charles James Fox, had taken a visiting French nobleman to a bawdy-house. On learning that their friend Bolingbroke was being entertained by one of the women, Egremont, Fox and the others kicked the door open. The woman was Elizabeth Armistead.British Library. Correspondence: Egremont/Holland  Career as a courtesan  Not long after the incident with Fox and Egremont, Lord Bolingbroke took Mrs Armistead out of the brothel and made her his mistress. Divorced from Lady Diana Spencer, Bolingbroke had consorted with many of the most celebrated courtesans of the time.Hicks, Carola. Improper Pursuits. Macmillan, 2001 According to Westminster Magazine, he arranged for his new mistress to try her hand at acting. In the autumn of 1774, billed as \\"a young lady who has never appeared on any stage\\", Elizabeth Armistead appeared three times at Covent Garden playhouse, performing the role of Indiana in Richard Steele's The Conscious Lovers. Shortly thereafter, she played Perdita in A Winter's Tale.Genest, John. Some Accounts of the English Stage, 1660–1830, 1832 The magazine was critical of her acting but praised her figure and voice. As the viscount's mistress, Armistead soon made friends with his circle including Fox, Egremont, the Hon. Richard FitzPatrick, Lord Robert Spencer, and James Hare. Her beauty and gentle nature made her sought after and ensured her the attentions of a string of rich and notable clients. By 1776, Town and Country reported that she could \\"claim the conquest of two ducal coronets, a marquis, four earls and a viscount\\".Town and Country Magazine, July 1776 Elizabeth Armistead's standing as mistress to high nobility attracted the interest of General Richard Smith, a man of humble origins who had amassed a fortune while in command of the East India Company's army of Bengal. Smith provided his new mistress with the leasehold of a house on Bond Street and a handsome allowance to maintain it. He may also have given her an annuity. The General enjoyed little of her company however, for he was soon imprisoned on corruption charges for trying to buy a seat in Parliament. Armistead's next notable patron was John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. She may have met the duke through her friendship with his maternal cousin, Richard FitzPatrick. Elizabeth Armistead was one of a number of celebrated courtesans kept by the duke over the years of his extended bachelorhood.Sackville-West, Vita. Knole and the Sackvilles. Heinemann, 1934 It may have been from Lord Dorset that she acquired the leasehold of a house on Clarges Street that was to become her principal residence. Toward the end of their alliance in 1777, she appeared in two plays by George Coleman at the Haymarket Theatre. According to Town and Country, Dorset's patronage ceased abruptly when he embarked on an affair with the Countess of Derby. His desertion was reported to have caused Mrs Armistead a period of financial difficulty.Davis, I.M. The Harlot and the Statesman. The Kendall Press, 1986 For a time, she spread her favours among several patrons including Lord George Cavendish, but soon the cuckolded Earl of Derby sought her favours. In the summer of 1778, the threat of French invasion sent Lord Derby to a militia camp in Winchester. George Selwyn wrote: \\"He does not, however, think his establishment complete without a declared mistress and he is therefore to take Mrs Armstead from Lord George that he may have the privilege of supporting her expenses entirely to himself.\\"Jesse, John Heneage. George Selwyn and his Contemporaries. London, 1901. That autumn the earl set her up in a house in the quiet suburb of Hampstead Heath. Though the scandal magazines predicted their liaison might become a lasting one, Armistead elected to return to Lord George Cavendish, who provided her with her second annuity.Town and Country Magazine, March 1779  High priestess of patriotism and royal mistress  Even as she supported herself with a string of wealthy lovers, Elizabeth Armistead maintained close friendships with the young politicians of the Whig party. When Richard Fitzpatrick was ordered to America with his regiment, she wrote letters to him enclosed in those of his friend Charles James Fox. Later, her drawing room at Clarges Street became a meeting place for the Foxite Whigs. It may have been through Fox and his friends that Armistead came to the notice of the Prince of Wales (the future George IV). Chafing for independence from his strict parents, the young prince had been drawn to Fox and his lively circle. A passionate affair with actress Mary Robinson had cooled, leaving him looking for a new mistress. According to Town and Country Magazine, the Prince spotted Mrs Armistead about town and directed his page to make approaches.Town and Country Magazine, March 1781 Their first encounter was reported to have taken place at an inn near Bushy Park. Mrs Robinson tried to rekindle the interest of her royal lover which the partisan newspapers of the day whipped up into a \\"severe contest\\" between the old mistress and the new.The Public Advertiser, 16 January 1781 Because of her connection with the Opposition Whigs, Elizabeth Armistead came under attack from the pro-Administration press. Whatever cachet the title of royal mistress may have brought her, she soon discovered the Prince had neither the inclination nor the funds to support her in the style she had long maintained. After several months, she set off on an extended Continental Tour as a means of breaking off the affair without giving offence to the future king. Shortly before going abroad, Mrs Armistead acquired the lease of a small country house in Surrey called St Ann's Hill. The place belonged to the estate of the Duke of Marlborough and probably came to her attention though his brother Lord Robert Spencer who was one of her Whig friends and a rumoured lover. For nearly a year, beginning in the summer of 1781, she toured the European continent with a string of titled patrons. Her former lover, Lord Derby, took her to Paris and then to Spa, Belgium. Later she was accompanied by the Earl of Cholmondeley to Italy, then by Lord Coleraine back to Paris. She returned to England to find the Whigs finally in power under Lord Rockingham and her friend Charles Fox in office as Foreign Secretary. After the death of Rockingham forced Fox to resign, he was rumoured to have had an affair with Mary Robinson before beginning one with his long- time friend Elizabeth Armistead.Countess of Ilchester and Stavordale ed., The Life and Letters of Lady Sarah Lennox, John Murray, 1904  Mistress and wife of Charles Fox  It is not known what compelled Charles James Fox and Elizabeth Armistead to become lovers after nearly a decade of platonic friendship. Perhaps the newspaper gossip that he was involved with her rival courtesan, Mrs Robinson, may have made her see her old friend in a different light. The relationship likely began with the expectation on both their parts that it would be temporary, but it soon became clear that Fox was smitten with his new mistress. When her exclusive attachment to him put her into debt, she tried to break it off but Fox refused to hear of it. \\"You shall not go without me, wherever you go,\\" he wrote. \\"I have examined myself and know that I can better abandon friends, country, everything than live without Liz.\\"British Library, Correspondence: Fox/Mrs Armistead They retired to St Ann's Hill where they lived quietly and simply. She sold her annuities and her houses in London to help pay down his debts. In 1785, she purchased the house and land from the Duke of Marlborough, who granted them a mortgage of £100 a year. Fox and Mrs Armistead had no children together but often had his nephew, Lord Holland, or his illegitimate children Harry Fox and Harriet Willoughby, to stay at St Ann's Hill. They also appear to have practically adopted young Robert St John, the grandson of Mrs Armistead's first keeper, Lord Bolingbroke. In 1795, after they had been together for more than ten years, Fox wrote to his nephew, \\"I think my affection for her increases every day. She is a comfort to me in every misfortune and makes me enjoy doubly every pleasant circumstance of life. There is to me a charm and delight in her society which time does not in the least wear off, and for real goodness of heart if she ever had an equal she certainly never had a superior.\\"British Library, Correspondence: Fox/Holland Not long after Fox wrote so glowingly of his unsanctified union with Elizabeth Armistead, their relationship was threatened when she learned that banker Thomas Coutts hoped Fox would marry his favourite daughter, Frances. Not wanting to stand in the way of such an advantageous match for him, Mrs Armistead offered to step aside but Fox would not hear of it. \\"I cannot figure to myself any possible idea of happiness without you,\\" he wrote, \\"and being sure of this is it possible that I can think of any trifling advantage of fortune or connection as weighing a feather in the scale against the whole comfort and happiness of my life?\\" To prevent her worrying that he might wed someone else, and to secure her future should any harm befall him, Fox resolved to marry his mistress. Mrs Armistead understood what a scandal it would cause and insisted the marriage be kept secret. On 28 September 1795, the two were wed in the parish of Wyton by Rev. John Pery with her maid Mary Dassonville and the parson's clerk Jeremiah Bradshaw as witnesses. For the next seven years they continued to live happily, to all appearances as mistress and keeper.Brayley, Edward Wedlake. History of Surrey, Vol. 2, London, 1842 In 1802, when they were about to embark on a trip to France where he would be honoured by Napoleon, Fox insisted on making the marriage public. The announcement caused some gossip and social awkwardness, but Mrs Fox was generally accepted. When Fox returned to office as Foreign Secretary in the Ministry of All the Talents, his wife managed the expected social obligations with aplomb that may have confounded her critics. \\"Mrs Fox is happy,\\" wrote Lady Elizabeth Foster, \\"but has the most perfect good sense as well as good nature in her new situation.\\" Elizabeth and her husband had little time to enjoy her social triumph. In the summer of 1806, he grew very ill with dropsy, a symptom of his fatal liver disease, and died at Chiswick on 13 September 1806. The last word he spoke was her name. \\"If we had not known it before,\\" wrote his nephew Lord Holland, \\"his last hours would have convinced us that the ruling passion of his heart was affection and tenderness for her.\\"  Statesman's respected widow  Though devastated by the death of her \\"angel\\", Mrs Fox returned to St Ann's Hill and continued the quiet, domestic life she had led with him. Out of loyalty to his memory and sincere affection for her his family and their circle of friends remained devoted to her. She often hosted company or paid visits to them. Following Fox's death, she was granted a pension of £1200 per year and in 1823 King George IV granted his former mistress an annuity of £500 per year which was continued by his brother and later his niece, Queen Victoria. Mrs Fox took a kind interest in the welfare of villagers from nearby Chertsey, subscribing to various charities and supporting a small school for the children of the parish. As the Victorian era dawned, the world conveniently forgot her notorious past. Instead she was regarded as one of the few remaining links with the Foxite Whigs, whose reforming zeal had finally begun to bear fruit. She died on 8 July 1842, within days of her ninety-second birthday. Her funeral took place at All Saints (now St Peter's) church in Chertsey. Her late husband's namesake great- nephew Colonel Charles Richard Fox was chief mourner together with his brother-in-law, Lord Lilford. As a token of respect, the Duke of Bedford sent an empty carriage to join the funeral cortege. \\"The ceremony was intended to be private,\\" reported the Windsor and Eton Express, \\"but persons of all classes were anxious to show their respect for one who has been so long and justly beloved, and who by her urbanity, kindness, and excessive benevolence, has acquired the esteem of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood of her own residence, St Ann's Hill.\\"The Windsor and Eton Express, 16 July 1842.

The Cambrian Railways, which completed the building in 1864, designed it to be both the station for the town and its company headquarters. This dual purpose gave Llandiloes station an imposing appearance. The station closed to passengers in 1962. The rest of the line was abandoned in 1967. The trackbed has been redeveloped as a bypass carrying traffic around Llanidloes town centre. The former station building has been restored and is now a business centre. History Llanidloes development into a major junction station arose because of the rapid and chaotic growth of the Victorian railway network in Great Britain. In 1859, the Mid-Wales Railway (MWR) had received an Act of Parliament to build and run a railway from Newtown to Brecon via Builth Wells and then on to Merthyr Tydfil, Cardiff or Neath. But just as the MWR began building north towards Llanidloes, problems arose when the Manchester and Milford Railway (M&MR;) finally received parliamentary assent to connect the industrial north west of England directly with the port of Milford Haven via a series of interconnecting lines in 1860. The initial proposal had been put forward in 1846 but the scheme was not passed until it received backing from the London and North Western Railway. As a result of this timing, parliament had accidentally granted the M&MR; and the MWR the same rights to build two separate lines through the same terrain. In response the M&MR; prioritised its work on completing the first section to Llandiloes by working east from Llangurig on what became known as the Llangurig branch. Further work west of Llangurig is visible on Google Earth and Victorian OS Maps including the portals of the summit tunnel at Blaen Myherin. However, by 1861, surveyors and navvies from the competing companies were physically clashing south of the town. In response, another Act of Parliament was passed in 1862, giving the jointly owned Llanidloes and Newtown Railway (L&NR;) (which was managed by the Cambrian Railways since 1860) the rights to extend southwards from Llanidloes with of double track to Penpontbren Junction where the M&MR; line would diverge to Carmarthen and the MWR line would continue to (serving Builth Wells). The M&MR; and MWR would both pay 5% \\"per annum\\" on construction costs and maintenance. The three companies would also pay equal shares of interest and running costs for a new station at Llanidloes. However these charges would eventually prove crippling for the M&MR.; The northern section from Llanidloes to Newtown would be operated through the jointly owned L&NR; connecting the MWR and M&MR; with the Oswestry and Newtown Railway. The commercial rivalry between the rail companies meant Llandiloes station would no longer be just a small country stop between Newtown and Builth Wells. It would now stand at the junction between the MWR and the M&MR.; The building was therefore designed in a style befitting a grand junction station and the headquarters of Cambrian Railways. When it was completed in 1864, Llandiloes had a Georgian-style exterior and the appearance of an early-19th-century country residence. The station also had a large island platform, a footbridge, and substantial freight sidings to the east. By 1875 the M&MR; was in receivership because it had been unable to raise the capital required to complete the railway from the NW England to west Wales. The line beyond Llangurig to Strata Florida for Carmarthen was abandoned after initial works to the summit tunnel including both north and south portals. The M&MR; was diverted west from Strata Florida to Aberystwyth; the remaining 1.5-mile spur from Penpontbren Junction to Llangurig was lifted in 1882 after carrying one demonstration freight train. This left the junction-intended Llandiloes without a junction. The grand station building was largely left unoccupied. The Cambrian Railways (CR) had already moved into its main headquarters at in 1864. On grouping in 1923, the CR became part of the Great Western Railway. In 1963, the station and the line were part of a proposed move into the London Midland Region of British Railways.

This species of Vachellia is native to eastern and southern Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Somalia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe). It has also become a landscape tree in other warm climates, outside of its natural range. Description The trees grow to a height of . The characteristic bark is smooth, powdery and greenish yellow, although new twigs are purple, flaking later to reveal the characteristic yellow. It is one of the few trees where photosynthesis takes place in the bark. Straight, white spines grow from the branch nodes in pairs. The leaves are twice compound, with small leaflets (). The flowers are produced in scented pale cream spherical inflorescences, clustered at the nodes and towards the ends of the branches. The pale brown pods contain 5-10 elliptical, flattened green seeds and are long, straight, flat and rather papery, the segments are mostly longer than they are wide, often breaking up to form small clusters of segments each containing an individual seed. As the pods mature they change colour from green to pale greyish brown. Fever trees are fast growing and short lived. They have a tendency to occur as single-aged stands, and are subject to stand-level diebacks that have been variously attributed to elephants, water tables, and synchronous senescence. Etymology In KwaZulu-Natal The name xanthophloea is derived from Greek and means \\"yellow bark\\" (ξανθός \\"yellow, golden\\"; φλοιός \\"bark\\"). The common name, fever tree, comes from its tendency to grow in swampy areas: early European settlers in the region noted that malarial fever was contracted in areas with these trees. It is now understood that malarial fever is spread by mosquitos living in the swampy areas that often support this tree species, and not by the tree species itself. This is because mosquitos often lay eggs in moist swampy areas, and they need blood to do that.Vachellia xanthophloea (as Acacia xanthophloea) entry at PlantZAfrica.com Ecology Trunk with greenish yellow bark Vachellia xanthophloea is found growing near swamps, riverine forests or on lake shores, in semi-evergreen bush land and woodland where there is a high groundwater table. In seasonally flooded areas it often forms dense single species stands. The leaves and pods are used to provide food for livestock while the young branches and foliage are eaten by African elephants while giraffe and vervet monkeys eat the pods and leaves. The flowers are used for foraging by bees and provides favoured nesting sites for birds. Like other acacias and Fabaceae it is a nitrogen fixer, so improves soil fertility. The gum is part of the diet of the Senegal bushbaby (Gallinago senegalensis) especially in the dry season. Butterflies recorded as feeding on Vachellia xanthophloea in Kenya included the Kikuyu ciliate blue (Anthene kikuyu), Pitman's hairtail (Anthene pitmani), common ciliate blue (Anthene definita), African babul blue (Azanus jesous), Victoria's bar (Cigaritis victoriae) and common zebra blue (Leptotes pirithous). In addition 30 species of larger moths have been recorded as feeding on this tree. Other uses Fever trees lining a road near Hartbeespoort Dam in South Africa Vachellia xanthophloea are planted next to dams and streams on farms to control soil erosion, as a live fence or hedge and in ornamental planting for shade and shelter in amenity areas. Vachellia xanthophloea is often planted as a source of firewood, but its gummy sap leaves a thick, black, tarlike residue when burnt. The valuable timber of Vachellia xanthophloea is pale reddish brown with a hard, heavy texture, and, because it is liable to crack, it should be seasoned before use. The timber is used to make poles and posts. Invasive species Flowers In Australia, Vachellia xanthophlea is a prohibited invasive plant in the state of Queensland under the Biosecurity Act 2014, under which it must not be given away, sold, or released into the environment without a permit. The act further requires that all sightings of Vachellia xanthophlea are to be reported to the appropriate authorities within 24 hours and that within Queensland everyone is obliged to take all reasonable and practical steps to minimise the risk of Vachellia xanthophlea spreading until they have received advice from an authorised officer. Although so far, it has only been found in a few gardens and not in the \\"wild\\". It is also a \\"declared pest\\" in Western Australia. In popular culture These trees are immortalized by Rudyard Kipling in one of his Just So Stories, \\"The Elephant's Child\\", wherein he repeatedly refers to \\"the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever- trees.\\"\\"The Elephant's Child\\" Shamanic usage This tree has been used for thousands of years by African tribes as a divination tool. Bark from this tree and four other herbs including Silene capensis (African dream root) and Synaptolepis kirkii are boiled into a brew. This is taken to induce lucid dreams, which they call \\"white paths\\". Before going to sleep a question is asked that will be answered in their dreams. Medicinally, the roots and a powder made from bark stripped from the trunk are used as an emetic and as a prophylactic against malaria. Gallery Notes and references Bibliography * Pooley, E. (1993).

Schurmann taught at the University of California, Berkeley, in the departments of Sociology and History for 38 years. He also served a term as the head of the Center for Chinese Studies. He was an early opponent of the Vietnam War, and was the first American professor to visit Hanoi during the bombing raids there.

He developed fluency in as many as 12 languages, acquiring them from his Slovenian father who spoke five languages himself, his mother who was an immigrant from Germany, and from the dialects spoken in the melting pot community where he was raised. He briefly attended Trinity College in nearby Hartford, Connecticut. He was drafted by the United States Army during World War II and was assigned to learn Japanese, serving as a newspaper censor during the American occupation of Japan. He befriended Stefan Brecht during his Army service and met Thomas Mann and other German émigrés at the California home of Stefan's father Bertolt Brecht. After completing his military service, Schurmann attended Harvard University where he was awarded a Ph.D. in Asian studies, which he was able to attend using his G.I.

Career  During the late 1950s, Schurmann spent two years exploring Afghanistan on horseback, where he documented a blue-eyed, blond-haired tribe that descended from the invasions by Genghis Khan, a history that he recounted in his 1962 book The Mongols of Afghanistan: An Ethnography of the Moghôls and Related Peoples of Afghanistan. He was an early opponent of the Vietnam War, founding the Berkeley Faculty Peace Committee in 1965 and visiting North Vietnam with author and political activist Mary McCarthy in 1968. In 1967, Schurmann signed a letter declaring his intention to refuse to pay taxes in protest against the U.S. war against Vietnam, and urging other people to also take this stand.\\"An Open Letter\\" archived at Horowitz Transaction Publishers Archive His major work Ideology and Organization in Communist China was published in 1966, just as Mao's Cultural Revolution was starting, and was revised and enlarged in 1968 and 1971. A widely influential analysis, the book applied the sociological insights of Max Weber to interviews Schurmann conducted in Hong Kong with refugees and wide reading in Chinese newspapers and documents. The book demonstrates how Mao Zedong's \\"dialectical conception of Chinese society\\" structured his organizational approach to the Chinese Communist Party and the government. The book argued that a \\"consistent yet changing ideology\\" created a web of organization which covered and penetrated all aspects of Chinese society, building from the 1930s.Ideology and Organization in Communist China (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966; revised and enlarged, 1968, 1971 He edited the three-volume series The China Reader with Orville Schell, a student of his who became an author and China expert in his own right. Together with Schell, he established the Pacific News Service in 1970, with the goal of providing Americans with more detailed coverage of news from Asia and Latin America. The service created New America Media in 1996, a multimedia ethnic news agency and a coalition of ethnic media organizations. His 1974 work The Logic of World Power provided a summary of international relations following World War II. The Foreign Politics of Richard Nixon, a book he wrote in the 1970s about the U.S. President's role in foreign affairs, was published in 1987. Schurmann wrote hundreds of columns for Pacific News Service about the development and goals of militant Islam.

Old Colorado City, built in 1858 during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush was the Colorado Territory capital. The town of Colorado Springs, was founded by General William Jackson Palmer as a resort town. Old Colorado City was annexed into Colorado Springs. Railroads brought tourists and visitors to the area from other parts of the United States and abroad. The city was noted for junctions for seven railways: Denver and Rio Grande (1870), Denver and New Orleans Manitou Branch (1882), Colorado Midland (1886-1918), Colorado Springs and Interurban (1887-1932 horse/electric tram), Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe (1889), Rock Island (1889), and Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek (1900-22 Short Line) Railways. It was also known for mining exchanges and brokers for the Cripple Creek Gold Rush. Palmer, Spencer Penrose, and Winfield Scott Stratton provided land and funding for parks, buildings, and non-profit organizations. It was a home to successful mine owners, artists, and writers. The climate and mountain setting made it a popular tourist destination and health resort. A dry climate supported resorts for people with weak lungs or tuberculosis, including the 19th and 20th century Colorado Springs sanatoria. In 1928–29, Alexander Aircraft Company was \\"the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world.\\" The city supported three World War II and Cold War military installations. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) center was located within the city before relocating to Cheyenne Mountain. Geological history The Garden of the Gods is one of the city's Pennsylvanian age's Fountain Formations. Another is the Red Rock Canyon Open Space Notable landforms, such as the Cheyenne Mountain on the city's southwest, were formed of Precambrian Pikes Peak granite uplifted in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains. Formation of the city's hills—including the Mesa, Institute Heights, and Knob Hill—created valleys for the Camp, Cheyenne, and Fountain creeks which enter the city on the west; Monument Creek from the north; and Cottonwood & Sand creeks (east). Bluffs formed with American Lower Eocene coal deposits of the Colorado Springs lignite field. Eponymic mineral springs, which flowed in 1912 from aquifers under the elevated landforms, included Horn's Mineral Springs at 1210 Lincoln, Monument Springs on Monument Creek's west bank in Monument Valley Park, and Jimmy's Camp Springs. There were also other springs located at that time on Bijou, Kiowa, 7th, and Cucharra streets and West Cheyenne Road. Before founding =Native American settlements= A Ute Indian photograph by Robert N. Dennis Ute people have believed that the Pikes Peak region is their home. Their name for Pikes Peak is Tavakiev, meaning sun mountain. They lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Summers were spent in the mountains, which was considered by other tribes to be the domain of the Utes. In the fall they would travel down Ute Pass and visited the springs where they \\"made offerings to the spirits of the springs for good health and good hunting\\". From there they began a journey eastward to hunt buffalo. They spent winters in mountain valleys where they were protected from the weather. Garden of the Gods artifacts from up to 3,500 years ago, such as grinding stones, \\"suggest the groups would gather together after their hunt to complete the tanning of hides and processing of meat.\\" For instance, grinding stones found there from B.C. were used by the Ute people. Arapaho, Cheyenne, and other tribes also gathered in the Manitou Springs and Garden of the Gods areas. Cheyenne Mountain, named after the Cheyenne people was considered a great source of timber for teepee poles. Waterfalls were believed by the Cheyenne and Arapaho to be a spiritual place where one might gain inspiration, which may have been why they visited the local Cañons. By 1882, Utes were forced to live on reservations in southwestern Colorado and eastern Utah. =Treaties and settler exploration= Part of the American frontier, Colorado Springs land was in New France (1682 treaty), New Spain (1762 treaty), and the United States' Louisiana Purchase beginning in 1803. When the region was bought by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase, explorers entered the area. Zebulon Pike explored the region in November 1806. The land including the current city was designated part of the 1854 Kansas Territory and on June 24, 1857, a team of Major John Sedgwick's Column camped at the mouth of Jimmy Camp Creek. In 1858, a subsequent April US Army camp was near Soda Spring in Manitou Springs, and the Lawrence Party camped at Garden of the Gods in July before establishing a town in or after September of that year at Montana City, which is now part of Denver, Colorado. Foundation =Gold rush settlement= Colorado City, now called Old Colorado City, was founded at the confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks on August 13, 1859, making it the first Pikes Peak region settlement. The Colorado City area became part of the Jefferson Territory on October 24 and of El Paso County on November 28, 1859. From November 5, 1861, until August 14, 1862 (including one legislative session), the city was the Colorado Territory capital. It then moved to Golden, before it was finally moved to Denver in 1867. Roads into the area included a toll road that connected to the northeast with the Overland's 1865 \\"Despatch Express Route\\". Southward out of Colorado City a stage road (now Old Stage Road) traversed through South Cheyenne Creek's canyon to Cripple Creek, and a carriage road through North and South Cheyenne Canyons and westward was the Ute Pass Wagon Road. Another route into the area was the north–south Cherokee Trail / Jimmy Camp Trail, which was near the Goodnight–Loving Trail. The Jimmy Camp Trail was one branch of the Trapper's Trail, a trail used by trappers and explorers from 1820 and during the gold rush. Trapper's Trail ran north–south from Fort Laramie to the El Pueblo trading post in the present Pueblo County, and from there branched off to Bent's Old Fort or Taos, New Mexico. =Colorado Springs founding and incorporation= Civil War General William Jackson Palmer came to the Colorado Territory as a surveyor with the Kansas Pacific Railway in search of possible railroad routes. Dr. William Abraham Bell from England was also part of the survey party. Having viewed the valley in the shadow of Pikes Peak as an ideal town site in July 1869, Palmer and Bell founded Fountain Colony, downstream of Colorado City, on July 31, 1871, and it was laid out by the Colorado Springs Company that year. The town was named Colorado Springs by 1879. It was named for springs found along Monument Creek as early as 1871. Four chalybeate mineral springs were later discovered along Monument Creek in October 1880. The El Paso County seat transferred from Colorado City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs. Early infrastructure included of irrigation canals along streets and a drinking water supply from Manitou's Ruxton Creek by 1879. Water was diverted to the Ruxton Creek Basin from the Middle Beaver Creek basin in 1889. (see also http://www2.coloradocollege.edu/dept/ev/faculty/hecox/Courses/EV421/March- April%202011/2010%20PPWS%20Forest%20Management%20Plan.pdf ) The town was \\"Little London\\" for the many English tourists and settlers actively recruited by Palmer's English associate Dr. William Abraham Bell and Palmer's English financial backers who provided the capital for his railroad, Denver and Rio Grande Railroad served the city beginning October 1871. In 1873 Colorado Springs became the county seat for the county; Previously, Old Colorado City was the county seat. Antlers Hotel, built in 1898 The Pikes Peak region was one of the most popular travel destinations in the late 19th century United States. The town saw an influx of writers, artists and people from England in the late 1870s, some of whom made their home in the town. Some of the key attractions were Garden of the Gods, Glen Eyrie, Pikes Peak, and Cheyenne Canyon. Domestic and international travelers were drawn to the high altitude, sunshine, mineral waters, and dry climate. The town was described as \\"a veritable Eden for consumptive invalids\\". At the peak of its period as a health resort for tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs, there were 17 tuberculosis hospitals in the area. The permanent residents fear of catching the highly contagious disease nearly resulted in a state bill that would have required tubercular patients to wear bells to announce their presence. The Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind and Colorado College were founded in 1874. Palmer opened the Antlers Hotel in 1882. Colorado Springs incorporated on June 19, 1886, After settlement =Late 19th century and early 20th century= Colorado Midland Railroad began service in the town in 1885. Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad service began in 1889. Trolleys ran to Manitou Springs the following year. Colorado Springs grew by 164% when 11,140 people settled in the town between 1880 and 1890. After the Cripple Creek gold discovery in 1891, the people who made a fortune from the gold rush and industry built large houses on Wood Avenue, then in the undeveloped downtown area of Colorado Springs. Several large stone buildings like Colorado College, St. Mary's Church, the first Antlers Hotel, the library, and the county courthouse were built on wide streets, in anticipation of significant population growth.Colorado College Tutt Library.

By 1898, the city that had grown through annexations of Old Colorado City, Ivywild, Roswell and other towns was designated into quadrants by the north–south Cascade Avenue and the east–west Washington/Pike's Peak avenues, along with voting precincts 27-41 and five wards with the fire alarm zones. Inventor Nikola Tesla built and operated his wireless power experimental station in 1899 on Knob Hill, near the current intersection of Foote and Kiowa Streets. Governor James Hamilton Peabody sent troops to Colorado City in 1903 to settle a miner's strike. They set up Camp Peabody at what became the 1903 Colorado Labor War. According to Mrs. Gilbert McClurg, reported in the Colorado Springs Gazette, General Palmer visited the west bank of Monument Creek and located a lost mineral spring so that it was included in his plans for Monument Valley Park. By 1905, the lake at Monument Valley Park was built at a cost of US$750,000 (), the YMCA building was built for $100,000 (), and Broadmoor Country Club built one of the city's two polo fields. There was a plan in 1911 plan to build a Colorado Springs Union Depot to consolidate the two railroad passenger depots, but it was never completed.Report of the Commission on the Colorado Springs Union Depot (available at PPLD Special Collections and the Colorado College Tutt Library) A zoological park was built along Cheyenne Creek, near Bear Creek Road (now Eighth Street), by 1916 and the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo was built in 1925 above The Broadmoor resort on the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo Road. In 1919, William Kennon Jewett deeded the Colorado Springs Golf Club's golf course to the City of Colorado Springs. Aircraft flights to the Broadmoor neighborhood fields began in 1919, the Alexander Airport (later called Nichols Field) north of the city opened in 1925 and land was purchased in 1927 for the first Colorado Springs Municipal Airport. Successful mine owner Winfield Scott Stratton funded the Myron Stratton Home for housing itinerant children and the elderly, donated land for City Hall, the main post office, the Courthouse, and a park; he also greatly expanded the city's trolley car system and built the Mining Exchange building. Spencer Penrose and his wife, over the course of their lives, financed construction of The Broadmoor resort (1918), Pikes Peak Highway, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (1921), Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun (1937), made a significant donation to what is now known as Penrose-St Francis Health Services, and established the El Pomar Foundation, which still oversees many of his contributions in Colorado Springs today. A bronze sculpture of Palmer on a horse was unveiled in 1929. To many residents who lived in Colorado Springs in the years since, Palmer became known as \\"the man on the iron horse\\". Many of the large homes in Colorado Springs were made into apartment houses or became boarding houses during the Depression of the 1930s and when there was a housing shortage during World War II. Some homes were also converted into office space. =Land purchases and annexation= Colorado Springs annexed Roswell in 1880. The city purchased 640 acres in North Cheyenne Cañon after citizens of Colorado Springs voted for the measure in 1885. Between 1889 and 1890 Seavey's Addition, West Colorado Springs, East End, and another North End addition were annexed to the city. In 1891, the Broadmoor Land Company began developing the Broadmoor suburb and built the Broadmoor Casino. By December 12, 1895, the city had \\"four Mining Exchanges and 275 mining brokers.\\" Silver Cascade Falls, Helen Hunt Falls, N. Cheyenne Canyon Road and other land in North Cheyenne were purchased and donated to the city in 1907 by William Jackson Palmer. The cañon was considered by the Park Commission to be \\"by far the grandest and most popular of all the beautiful cañons near the city.\\" Several areas near downtown, such as North End and Wood Avenue were annexed by 1912 and Colorado City (now called Old Colorado City) was annexed in 1917. After a lull between 1917 and 1946, annexation began in earnest. Some examples of annexed areas are: Pleasant Valley (1950), Knob Hill (1952), Austin Bluffs (1958-1965), Pike View (1962), Papeton (1968), Woodmen Valley (1969), and Stratton Additions (1966-1971). Between 1960 and 1970 divisions of Cheyenne Mountain, Elmere, Black Forest-Peyton, Fountain, Pikes Peak and Monument were annexed into Colorado Springs, resulting in an increased population of 37,500 by 1970. Broadmoor and Skyway were annexed, without a vote of its residents, before the state's Poundstone Amendment (1974) was enacted. Briargate was annexed in 1982. Parks The first city park in Colorado Springs, included in the initial town plans in 1871, is Acacia Park. It was initially called Acacia Square or North Park. General William Jackson Palmer donated land to establish Acacia and additional parks, including: Antlers Park, Monument Valley Park, North Cheyenne Cañon, Palmer Park, Pioneer Square (South) Park, Prospect Lake and Bear Creek Cañon Park. He donated a total of 1,270 acres of land, some of which was also used for scenic drives, tree-lined roadways and foot and bridle paths. The Perkins heirs donated Garden of the Gods to the city in 1909. =Military installations= The city purchased land at the southern border of the city and donated it to the War Department. After the Pearl Harbor attack, the U.S. Army established Camp Carson, named for General Kit Carson, near the southern borders of the city as a training facility in preparation for World War II. Colorado Springs Municipal Airport was used by the Colorado Springs Army Air Base and was assigned to the Air Force in 1942 for photo reconnaissance training. It was renamed Peterson Field for Lt. Edward J. Peterson who died during a takeoff from the field. After World War II there was little military presence in the city. Camp Carson had only 600 soldiers. When the Korean War began there was an influx of military personnel. Over time, Camp Carson grew and became a significant industry within the city. In 1951, the United States Air Defense Command moved to Colorado Springs and opened Ent Air Force Base. In 1954 Camp Carson became Fort Carson. That year the United States Air Force Academy was established. NORAD headquarters, 2006 NORAD's main facility was built in Cheyenne Mountain, which permanently secured the city's military presence and as a result increased the city's revenue, and opened in 1966. Ent Air Force Base was shut down and in 1977 was converted into the United States Olympic Training Center. Peterson Field was renamed Peterson Air Force Base and was permanently activated. In 1983 Falcon Air Force Base, (later Schriever Air Force Base), was founded as a missile defense and satellite control center. Air Force Space Command is located on Peterson AFB. =Late 20th and early 21st century= Between 1965 and 1968 the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak Community College and the Colorado Technical University were established in the city. In 1972, the city's first National Register of Historic Places designation was the 1903 El Paso County Courthouse. The first designated historic district was the 1979 Rock Ledge Ranch Historic Site. In 1977, most of the former Ent Air Force Base became the first US Olympic Training Center, and the US Olympic Committee moved there in 1978. In 2012, the Waldo Canyon fire destroyed 346 homes and killed two people in the city. Gallery File:Alamo hotel Colorado Springs Colorado.JPGAlamo Hotel, 128 S.

Based on a 1959 novel by Jack Finney, it was adapted for the screen by Rod Serling and released by Paramount Pictures on June 15, 1966. Plot A World War II-era German submarine missing for 20 years is retrieved in the Bahamas by diver Mark Brittain (Frank Sinatra), and hired by the wealthy Rosa Lucchesi and her partner Vic Rossiter, who have been searching for sunken Spanish galleons. The recovery of the submarine results in a plot devised by Eric Lauffnauer, a U-boat officer during the war, to pull a daring million-dollar heist on the British ocean liner Queen Mary, which he and the others plan to rob on the high seas while the liner is making a transatlantic crossing. Brittain gets the submarine in working order with the assistance of his own partner, Linc, and a new man, Moreno, a war hero and expert with engines. Disguised as officers from a British vessel on a top-secret mission, Brittain, Rossiter and Lauffnauer board the Queen Mary, where they seize the bullion in the cargo hold. The captain complies after the pirates threaten to open fire on the ship and its civilian passengers. Rossiter's greed leads to his being killed by a member of the Queens crew. Brittain must abandon the money when Lauffnauer prepares to dive the submarine without him. A U.S. Coast Guard cutter in the vicinity comes to the ocean liner's aid. Lauffnauer elects to fire the submarine's torpedoes at it. When the others protest, he draws a gun. Rosa tries to stop him and Lauffnauer accidentally shoots his friend, Moreno. The Coast Guard cutter destroys the torpedoes that Lauffnauer manages to fire from the U-boat. Brittain, Rosa and Linc dive off the submarine, just before it is rammed by the Americans killing the crazy Lauffnauer. The remaining gang members survive, paddling a raft, but their mission has resulted in three deaths and netted them nothing.

The shuttle linked the main building of the terminal and its satellite, 279 metres away. The whole ride took a minute, and was free of charge. The system was made by Nippon Otis Elevator, a company specialising in elevators and escalators. It was technically (and legally) not a railway, but a horizontal elevator; cars were attached to a cable that moved them, like a funicular. The cars did not have wheels; instead, they floated on a 0.2-mm layer of compressed air. This was the first use of such a system to be used in an airport, as well as the first in Japan.

It was constructed in 1903 by Hugh Bovill, an English settler and son of Sir William Bovill, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Hugh and his wife, Charlotte, operated the house as a hotel from 1903 to 1911, serving tourists and loggers. In addition to lodging, the hotel also housed a store, and was a hub for local commerce in the community. Disillusioned with the growing presence of the timber industry in Bovill and the destruction of the area's forests, the Bovill family left the property around 1911. They would return in the early 1930s with an unsuccessful attempt at reviving the hotel, before permanently leaving it behind. The structure would continue to serve as a lodging building for timber workers through the majority of the 20th century, until the 1980s. The Hotel Bovill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. At the time, it was noted that the property was vacant and in an increasing state of dilapidation. History A log cabin homestead was established in Bovill in 1891 by Francis Warren. This cabin was subsequently purchased by English settler Hugh Bovill in 1899, who relocated the cabin to the site of the Hotel Bovill. Bovill was the son of Sir William Bovill, an English lawyer and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. In 1884, Hugh married Charlotte ( Robinson), the daughter of a Canon in York Minister and Commissioner of Education under Queen Victoria, and the couple moved into the cabin at the Hotel Bovill site. Within the next four years, the two-story structure was built, complete with decorative millwork and gabled peaks, with ornate porch railings and columns. In 1903, the structure was known locally as \\"Headquarters.\\" Between 1903 and 1911, an adjacent store was constructed on the property, in addition to expansion of the main home, followed by a shed which functioned as the city's post office. The modifications to the main home in 1911 united the store and main house into a single building, and the front porch was expanded to continuously span the length of the building, with drop siding added to the structure. Circa this period, the house began to function as a hotel, and was named Hotel Bovill. The hotel facility was the sole supply and lodging center in the Bovill area for both tourists and timber prospectors. The Bovill family continued to live in the home and served as proprietors of the lodgers. Charlotte Bovill gained local notoriety for her \\"wilderness cuisine\\" served to lodgers, which included huckleberry pie, roasted bear, venison, homemade rhubarb wine, and ginger beer. Around 1911, the Bovill family were dismayed by the \\"ravaged\\" forests and influx of logging in the area, which prompted them to relocate to Coeur d'Alene, leaving behind a reported $150,000 worth of property. In the early 1930s, the Bovills returned to the hotel during the Civilian Conservation Corps-era, unsuccessfully hoping to reopen the hotel, before leaving the property permanently. Hugh Bovill died in Newport, Oregon in 1935, and Charlotte in Santa Cruz, California, in 1946. In the 1950s, the original wooden foundation was replaced with concrete blocks, and a composition shingle roof was added to prevent further deterioration of the structure. For the majority of the latter-half of the 20th century, the Hotel Bovill continued to function as a hotel, primarily for loggers and other timber industry workers. Status and preservation In 1994, the property was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It was noted in the May 1994 NRHP application: At the time of its NRHP listing, the property was vacant and in a state of increasing dilapidation.

Thompson (born January 7, 1939 in Detroit, Michigan) is an American- born Danish biblical scholar and theologian. He was professor of theology at the University of Copenhagen from 1993 to 2009, and he lives in Denmark. Thompson is a part of the minimalist movement known as the Copenhagen School, a group of scholars who hold that the Bible cannot be used as a source to determine the history of ancient Israel, and that \\"Israel\\" itself is a problematic concept.Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&T; Clark 2014 THOMAS L. THOMPSON p.24 Biography Thompson was raised as a Catholic and obtained a bachelor of arts from Duquesne University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, in 1962. After a year in Oxford, he moved to Tübingen, where he studied for 12 years with Kurt Galling and Herbert Haag.Philip R Davies.'Introduction' to Thomas L. Thompson, Biblical Narrative and Palestine's History: Changing Perspectives 2, Routledge 2014 p.1. In the meantime, he was instructor in theology at Dayton University (1964–65) and assistant professor in Old Testament studies at the University of Detroit (1967–69). He then studied Catholic theology at the University of Tübingen; his dissertation, \\"The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham\\", was completed in 1971, but rejected by the Catholic faculty (one of his examiners was Joseph Ratzinger, then Tübingen's Professor of Systematic Theology and later Pope Benedict XVI). Thompson then considered submitting his dissertation to the Protestant faculty, but left Tübingen in 1975 without a degree. The rejected dissertation was published in 1974 by De Gruyter Press.P.R.F. Moorey, \\"A Century of Biblical Archaeology\\", p.114. The work, together with John Van Seters' Abraham in History and Tradition, became one of the pioneer works of biblical minimalism. While teaching part-time at the University of North Carolina, he was invited to finish his studies at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, receiving his Ph.D. in Old Testament studies summa cum laude in 1976.Thompson, Thomas L. 2011. On the Problem of Critical Scholarship: A Memoire The controversy around his dissertation prevented him from obtaining a position at a North American university.Thomas Thompson.The Mythic Past (Basic Books: New York, 1999), p. xiii He continued as a private scholar while working as a high-school teacher, janitor, and house painter until he was awarded a guest professorship at the École Biblique in Jerusalem in 1984. This appointment proved controversial among Israelis, who, according to Thompson, objected to his earlier study casting doubt on the historicity of the Jewish origin narratives. He then worked on a project on Palestinian place names for UNESCO, criticizing Israeli authorities for de-Arabicizing Palestinian place names. Accusations of antisemitism led to the project being closed. Thompson was named a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow in 1988. He taught as visiting associate professor at Lawrence University (1988–89) and as associate professor at Marquette University (1989–1993), but did not receive tenure. In 1990, he met Danish theologian Niels Peter Lemche at a conference, and in 1993, joined the faculty of the department of theology at the University of Copenhagen as professor in Old Testament exegesis. He retired and was granted emeritus status in 2009. Thompson is general editor for the series Copenhagen International Seminar, associate editor of the Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament, and serves on the editorial boards of the journals Holy Land Studies and Dansk Teologisk Tidsskrift. Old Testament writings The focus of Thompson's writing has been the interface between the Bible (specifically the Old Testament) and archaeology. His The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives (1974) was a critique of the then-dominant view that biblical archaeology had demonstrated the historicity of figures such as Abraham and other Biblical patriarchs.Marc Brettler. \\"The Copenhagen School: The Historiographical Issues The Copenhagen School: The Historiographical Issues\\", AJS Review, Vol. 27, No. 1 (April 2003), p. 1-21 His The Early History of the Israelite People From the Written and Archaeological Sources (1993) set out his argument that the biblical history was not reliable, and concludes: \\"The linguistic and literary reality of the biblical tradition is folkloristic in essence. The concept of a benei Israel ... is a reflection of no sociopolitical entity of the historical state of Israel of the Assyrian period....\\" In The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past (U.S. title: The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel), he argued that the Old Testament was entirely, or almost entirely, a product of the period between the fifth and second centuries BC.A book review by Danny Yee Thompson's arguments were criticized by many biblical scholars, prominent among them William G. Dever in his book What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?, which has been described as \\"a very polemic and partly vehement attack not least against Professor Thomas L. Thompson\\". Thompson himself reviewed Dever's book and provided his own responses to Dever's critiques. The fact that Thompson, as a target of many of the critiques advanced in the book would have chosen to review it, was criticized by H. Hagelia.H. Hagelia. (2002). \\"Review or response? A critical evaluation of Thomas L. Thompson's review of William G. Dever.\\" Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament, 16(2), 314-318. New Testament writings Thompson presented a criticism of the historicity of the New Testament in his 2005 book, The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David, He argues that the biblical accounts of both King David and Jesus of Nazareth are mythical in nature and based on Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Greek and Roman literature. For example, he argues that the resurrection of Jesus is taken directly from the myths about Dionysus, which he described as a \\"dying and rising god\\". Thompson did not draw a final conclusion on the historicity or ahistoricity of Jesus. He was a fellow of the short-lived Jesus Project from 2008 to 2009. The Messiah Myth was criticized by New Testament scholars such as Bart Ehrman, who in 2012 published a criticism of Jesus ahistoricity theory proponents, Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth, in which he stated that \\"A different sort of support for a mythicist position comes in the work of Thomas L.

This antenna uses a top-loaded design and a full, 120-wire ground radial counterpoise system. Construction of the antenna was begun in October 2008 after approval for the low profile antenna design was approved by Lane County. The overall height of the antenna system at 70 feet above ground level was an aid in securing permit approval and acceptance by nearby residents. Construction of a new transmitter building and installation of transmitting equipment was completed in January 2009.

It runs from Maryland Route 291 (MD 291) at the Maryland border west of Blackiston to the Delaware Bay in Woodland Beach. The route passes through rural areas of northern Kent County as well as the towns of Clayton and Smyrna. DE 6 intersects DE 42 in Blackiston, DE 15 in Clayton, DE 300 and U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Smyrna, and DE 9 to the east of Smyrna. The road was built as a state highway during the 1920s and 1930s and received the DE 6 designation by 1936. The easternmost part of the route was paved in the 1960s and the route was moved to its current alignment bypassing downtown Smyrna by the 1990s. Route description DE 6 eastbound past DE 15 in Clayton DE 6 begins at the Maryland border, where the road continues west into that state as MD 291\\\\. From the state line, the route heads east on two-lane undivided Millington Road, passing through the Blackiston Wildlife Area. The road runs through areas of woods and farms with some homes. In Blackiston, DE 6 intersects the western terminus of DE 42, which heads southeast toward the town of Kenton. The route continues east through more agricultural areas and reaches a junction with DE 15, at which point residential development near the road increases. DE 15 turns east to form a concurrency with DE 6, with the two routes continuing east. Upon reaching the western edge of the town of Clayton, DE 15 splits from DE 6 by heading to the north. DE 6 proceeds northeast through Clayton on Main Street, where it passes homes along with a few businesses. In Clayton, the road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at- grade as it turns more to the east. The route continues into the town of Smyrna, where it becomes Smyrna Clayton Boulevard. Shortly after entering Smyrna, DE 6 crosses Greens Branch and intersects DE 300, where it turns northeast onto West Glenwood Avenue and forms a concurrency with DE 300\\\\. The two routes pass a mix of homes and businesses before gaining a center left- turn lane past the Main Street intersection and entering a commercial area in the northern part of Smyrna as East Glenwood Avenue. Here, the road widens into a divided highway before intersecting US 13\\\\. At this point, DE 300 ends and DE 6 turns southeast to form a concurrency with US 13\\\\. The two routes pass more businesses on four-lane divided North Dupont Boulevard. DE 6 splits from US 13 by heading to the east on two-lane undivided East Commerce Street, running through residential areas. The route passes over the DE 1 toll road without an interchange and leaves Smyrna. Upon leaving Smyrna, DE 6 becomes Woodland Beach Road and passes to the north of Smyrna Airport. The road heads east into agricultural areas, crossing Mill Creek as it winds east. The route intersects DE 9 before turning northeast into marshland within the Woodland Beach Wildlife Area. DE 6 turns north and reaches its eastern terminus at an intersection with Delaware Avenue in the community of Woodland Beach, located along the Delaware Bay. The portion of the route between Alley Mill Road west of Clayton and DE 300 in Smyrna is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 6 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 26,210 vehicles at the east end of the US 13 concurrency to a low of 525 vehicles at the Delaware Avenue intersection in Woodland Beach. None of DE 6 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, what is now DE 6 existed as an unimproved county road. The road was completed as a state highway within Clayton and was proposed as one from Clayton west to Blackiston by 1924. On August 5, 1925, the state highway between Clayton and Blackiston was completed. In 1929, the road leading to Woodland Beach was completed as a state highway. The portion of the road between Blackiston and the Maryland border was upgraded to a state highway in 1930. When Delaware created its state highway system by 1936, DE 6 was routed between the Maryland border west of Blackiston and Woodland Beach, following its current alignment to Smyrna, passing through Smyrna on Commerce Street, and continuing east on its current alignment to Woodland Beach. All of the route was paved except for the portion between present-day DE 9 and Woodland Beach. The eastern portion of the road was paved by 1967. By the 1990s, DE 6 was routed onto its current alignment through Smyrna along DE 300 and US 13, bypassing the downtown area.

It is most notable in Western countries outside of Italy in the form of ice cream. Fruits used for tutti frutti ice cream include cherries, raisins, and pineapple, often augmented with nuts. In the Netherlands, tutti-frutti (also \\"tutti frutti,\\" \\"tuttifrutti\\") is a compote of dried fruits, served as a dessert or a side dish to a meat course. In Belgium, tutti-frutti is often seen as a dessert. Typically, it contains a combination of raisins, currants, apricots, prunes, dates, and figs. In the United States, tutti frutti can also refer to fruits soaked in brandy or other spirits, or even to fruit fermented in a liquid containing sugar and yeast. In Indian English, tutti frutti usually refers to candied raw papaya. These are often small cubical pieces, often brightly colored. The most common color being red, it is also available in green and yellow. These are used in various bakery products, including cakes, milk- breads, cookies, dilkhush and buns. Tutti frutti is also used in cold desserts as topping for ice cream and sundaes. They are also used in sweet paans and sangeet (or \\"paper-masala\\"). History Tutti frutti ice cream has been served for at least 160 years, as it appeared on the bill of fare for an 1860 dinner in England. Recipes for tutti frutti ice cream were found in cookbooks of the late 19th century. A tutti frutti ice cream recipe was included in the 1874 cookbook Common Sense in the Household: A Manual of Practical Housewifery This recipe calls for actual tutti frutti and is not fancifully named. In the 1883 cookbook The Chicago Herald Cooking School there is also a tutti frutti ice cream recipe. In 1888, one of the first gum flavors to be sold in a vending machine, created by the Adams New York Gum Company, was tutti frutti. Many restaurant menus circa 1900 in the collection of the New York Public Library also list this variety of ice cream. At least one early 20th century American cookbook contains a suggestion that tutti frutti ice cream was popular in America. The Italian Cookbook contains a recipe for Tutti Frutti Ice and says, \\"This is not the tutti frutti ice cream as is known in America\\". A 1928 cookbook, Seven Hundred Sandwiches by Florence A. Cowles (published in Boston) includes a recipe for a Tutti Frutti Sandwich with a spread made of whipped cream, dates, raisins, figs, walnuts, and sugar.

From there, it runs generally northwest, including a 29 km concurrency with Highway 3 from just north of Turtleford to just south of St. Walburg, where it turns to a more northerly route (while Highway 3 continues west). Highway 26 continues north until it terminates at a junction with Highway 224 and Highway 950, at the northern edge of the village of Goodsoil. Route description The southern of the Highway 26 runs beside a former Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) branch line from Prince to St. Walburg, which CNoR built out from North Battleford and steadily extended until 1919. The rail line, and adjoining roads, caused a boom in the area, as early homesteaders were then able to deliver their production to grain elevators. The Canadian National Railway abandoned the entire branch line in 2005, when the remaining grain elevators closed, with grain now transported by truck on Highway 26. Major attractions Along Highway 26 these are a listing of lakes, big things, statues, historical markers, beaches, historical sites and buildings, national, regional and provincial parks. * The Goodsoil Historical Museum Site, in Goodsoil, is a Municipal Heritage Property on the Canadian Register of Historic Places. *Makwa Lake Provincial Park *Makwa Lake *Jackfish Lake just to the east of route near Meota. *The Battlefords Provincial Park, which borders Jackfish Lake *Meadow Lake Provincial Park *Ernie the Turtle at Turtleford *Windmill at Village of Edam *Imhoff Museum & Art Gallery at St. Walburg *St.Walburg & District Historical Museum at St. Walburg Major intersections From south to north: References External links *Saskatchewan Highways Website—Highway Numbering *Saskatchewan Road Map RV Itineraries *Big Things of Canada, A Celebration of Community Monuments of Canada 026 ","title":"Saskatchewan Highway 26"},{"id":"10741710","text":"5th Canadian Division Support Base Detachment Aldershot (also 5 CDSB Det Aldershot) is a training facility for 5th Canadian Division of the Canadian Army. It is located in Kings County, Nova Scotia. 5 Cdn Div Support Base Det Aldershot is located northwest of Kentville on a well-drained sandy plateau along the north side of the Cornwallis River. Surrounded by the agricultural heartland of Nova Scotia in the Annapolis Valley, 5 Cdn Div Support Base Detachment Aldershot is situated primarily on marginal agricultural land not suitable for crop growing. Relatively few military personnel are stationed at the training centre as it serves primarily for training regular force and Primary Reserve units of the Canadian Army's 5th Canadian Division. The training centre element at Camp Aldershot conducts year-round courses for Regular Force personnel, while expanding dramatically during the summer months to accommodate the numerous courses for Primary Reserve personnel. During the period of September–June 5 Cdn Div Support Base Det Aldershot serves as the primary weekend training location for Primary Reserve and Royal Canadian Army Cadets exercises for units from the Halifax metro area, and other locations in the Maritime Provinces. Camp Aldershot During the 1890s and the lead up to the Boer War, the British Army, which was responsible for Canada's defence until 1906, established Military Camp Aldershot (also shortened to Camp Aldershot) as a training area on land in the western part of Kings County between the villages of Aylesford and Kingston. Camp Aldershot was intended to train Canadian Militia units from Nova Scotia and was served by the Cornwallis Valley Railway branch line of the Dominion Atlantic Railway line running through the area. It received its name in honour of Aldershot in Hampshire, United Kingdom, the site of the home of the British Army. In 1904, the facility was moved to its present site on northwest of Kentville with its southern boundary along the Cornwallis River. The eastern boundary of the base abutted the Cornwallis Valley Railway which operated north from Kentville to Kingsport, providing efficient transport of troops and supplies. The Department of Militia and Defence took over administration of the facility from the British Army in 1906. Used almost exclusively as a militia facility from its inception, various militia units of cavalry, infantry and artillery from across Nova Scotia received training. Few permanent structures were established at Camp Aldershot in its early years, with militia units being required to erect canvas tents during training and to stable horses in the open. Camp Aldershot saw extensive use during the First World War with in excess of 7,000 soldiers being trained for the infantry at any particular time. Temporary buildings were constructed to house messes and cookhouses, as well as a camp hospital, however most soldiers training at Camp Aldershot during this time period were housed in canvas tents. Temporary structures were removed following the armistice in 1918 and the camp reverted to its previous use as a militia training facility, seeing very light use throughout the inter-war period when Canada's military underwent extensive downsizing. Given its proximity to Halifax which became a major troop shipment port, the camp underwent significant expansion during the Second World War with numerous new buildings constructed between 1939 and 1943. Only a single building from the First World War was retained, while water and sewer systems were installed in the camp's headquarters area (which was named Aldershot for postal purposes), firing ranges and parade squares established and various support buildings and barracks. Despite the construction of barracks, the huge influx of soldiers required the use of tents for housing along with temporary cookhouses. Camp Aldershot hosted the Canadian Army's 14 Advanced Infantry (Rifle) Training Centre (14 AITC) throughout the war. 14 AITC included instructor schools, trade schools, and officer training schools. The facility experienced some of its most demanding training toward the end of the war as the 14 AITC was tasked with preparing troops for Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan. Following the war, Camp Aldershot went into decline when compared to its war- time activity, however its well-constructed Second World War-era facilities were maintained given the tensions of the Cold War. In 1953 The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada returned from service in the Korean War and the First and Second Battalions were stationed at Camp Aldershot, along with additional units at Camp Debert. From 1953 to 1959, Camp Aldershot saw significant use while housing this regular force unit. The Black Watch's 2,300 soldiers along with dependents and civilian support staff pumped $15 million annually into the local economy. The Black Watch rotated to West Germany in 1959 and was stationed at the newly constructed Camp Gagetown in New Brunswick upon its return, delivering a significant blow to Camp Aldershot and Camp Debert, which had no regular force units returning to fill the void. Camp Aldershot was left with the Canadian Army's reserve militia units from Nova Scotia as its primary users, primarily The West Nova Scotia Regiment, however the Royal Canadian Army Cadets also used the camp as a Cadet Summer Training Centre (CSTC) from the late 1940s-late 1960s. Aldershot range and training area The late 1960s saw numerous changes to Canada's military during the unification of the Canadian Forces. Camp Aldershot underwent more decline as facility rationalization throughout the military took place and the army cadets established ACSTC Argonaut at CFB Gagetown. Rumours of the camp being declared surplus began during the early 1970s when military activity was at an all-time low, thus the new Atlantic Militia Area of Mobile Command began to increase training of reservists at the newly designated Militia Training Centre on the site in 1973. The use of the term \\"Camp Aldershot\\" was officially discontinued in lieu of Aldershot Range and Training Area. LFAATC Aldershot Training continued at ARTA through the 1970s and 1980s until the mid-1990s when the camp was designated to become host to the newly formed Land Force Atlantic Area training centre, officially termed LFAA TC Aldershot. Since the LFAATC was located at Aldershot, the majority of the Second World War-era buildings have been replaced by new construction, although the single First World War-era structure that was maintained has been incorporated as the new officers mess. Currently 5 Cdn Div TC Detachment Aldershot provides the majority of training for the 5th Canadian Division reserve units during the summer months, as well as a training area for Nova Scotia reserve units through the remainder of the year. Mess and barracks The mess is located behind only a few steps from course barracks. It has two serveries with only one open most days and a senior and officer eating area. The barracks for course as well as the class rooms, computer lab and offices all share one building. Half of the build is two top and bottom H hallways with rooms on the outer of the four halls. Rooms consist of eight bunks and three bunks and lockers. Each wing (A, B, C, D) has their own common room which consists of a TV and some sofa chairs, a microwave and table with chairs. They also have a kit cleaning room. Local Freedoms Land Force Atlantic Area Training Centre Aldershot was awarded the Freedom of the Town of Kentville, Nova Scotia on 14 October 2012.

It became the largest African-American culture and music event in the United States. Locally referred to as the Essence Fest, it has been held in New Orleans, Louisiana since 1995 except in 2006, when it was held in Houston, Texas due to Hurricane Katrina's effect on New Orleans and 2020 when it was cancelled. It was also held in Durban, South Africa in 2016. The festival features artists simultaneously performing on a main stage as well as four standing-room only superlounge stages. In 2008, for the first time since its 1995 inception, the festival was not produced by the original producer team. Instead, Essence Communications, owner of the festival and the Essence magazine, contracted Rehage Entertainment Inc. Starting 2013, Solomon Group became the Producer of Essence Festival. In 2013, MSNBC broadcast live from the Essence Festival. MSNBC returned for the 2014 festival. 2020 saw the event get cancelled with the COVID-19 pandemic to blame; the 26th is deferred to 2021.

Sub-specialty recognition and Board Certification Gastrointestinal pathology (including liver, gallbladder and pancreas) is a recognized sub- specialty discipline of surgical pathology. Recognition of a sub-specialty is generally related to dedicated fellowship training offered within the subspecialty or, alternatively, to surgical pathologists with a special interest and extensive experience in gastrointestinal pathology. There are approximately 30 gastrointestinal pathology fellowships offered within the United States (predominantly academic, and more recently three \\"corporate\\" fellowships). This translates to fewer than 40 fellowship trained gastrointestinal pathologists being trained annually in the United States each year. Fellowship in gastrointestinal pathology involves: * diagnostic evaluation of surgical (whole organ) and biopsy pathology of gastrointestinal tissue, [with the exception of at least one corporate fellowship] * consistent interaction with clinical colleagues (gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons and gastrointestinal radiologists) to ensure understanding of the clinical aspects of gastrointestinal disease, treatment modalities and other diagnostic findings; * research in gastrointestinal physiology, disease mechanisms and histomorphology * education of general pathologists and clinical colleagues. During the course of a one-year gastrointestinal pathology fellowship, the GI- liver pathology fellow will review between 8,000 and 15,000 gastrointestinal and liver biopsy and surgical specimens with all clinical history, laboratory data and frequently, knowledge of response to treatment. This volume of cases is similar to approximately five years of case experience for general surgical pathologists in private practice. Board certification in the United States requires approval by the certifying body, the American Board of Pathology. There has been considerable debate among academic and private practice gastrointestinal pathologists regarding the necessity, advantages and disadvantages of Board Certification in this subspecialty. The debate was last formally approached in 2001, during Dr. Joel K. Greenson's tenure as President of the Rodger C. Haggitt Gastrointestinal Pathology Society. The decision to seek Board Certification was declined by the membership of the Society. =History of the Rodger C. Haggitt Gastrointestinal Pathology Society= At the 1976 annual meeting of the organization then called the International Academy of Pathology (IAP), now the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP), the long course was devoted to gastrointestinal pathology. Due to its success, the first evening subspecialty conference devoted to gastrointestinal pathology was presented the following year at the IAP annual meeting in March 1977. That first evening session was organized by Jack Yardley from Johns Hopkins University, and included Henry Appelman (University of Michigan), Harvey Goldman (Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School), Bill Hawk (The Cleveland Clinic), Tom Kent (University of Iowa), Si- Chun Ming (Temple University), Tom Norris (University of Washington), and Robert Riddell (University of Chicago). This group, headed by Henry Appelman, organized a group for gastrointestinal pathologists. Every gastrointestinal pathologist in the United States and Canada received an invitation to attend the first organizational meeting, held during the 1979 IAP meeting. At that meeting, the establishment of a society was approved, and four subcommittees were formed to deal with membership, finances, bylaws, and educational activities. During the next year, all organizational functions were completed, and at the 1980 IAP meeting, the organization was officially established, by- laws were approved, the first officers elected, the first dues collected, and the first educational program was offered. The original name for the organization was the Gastrointestinal Pathology Club. Only later did it achieve \\"Society\\" status. In 2001, after the tragic and untimely homicidalOlympia Washington newspaper, Morning Olympian, 29 June 2000, page 19 and 1 November 2000, page 19 death of Dr. Rodger C. Haggitt, the name of the society was officially changed to Rodger C. Haggitt Gastrointestinal Pathology Society. The organization was developed as a mechanism: * for propagating interest in gastrointestinal pathology * for emphasizing the importance of gastrointestinal pathology as a sophisticated and complex area of pathology * for sharing information among members * for developing joint investigative efforts among members * for establishing referral centers or referral mechanisms for specific types of case problems * for devising a registry for unusual cases. The first three of these initial goals were accomplished early on. The Club was recognized as a companion society of the IAP and its first scientific session was presented about a year later. The fourth goal took longer, but it, too, has been fulfilled as exemplified by a published study on adenomas with invasive carcinoma that was shepherded by Harry Cooper. It took e-mail technology to really allow the fifth goal, the referral network, to operate. The development of an e-mail group from the Society, which became an opportunity for members to consult a wide group of GI colleagues regarding problem cases, has been functional since 1995. The sixth goal, the registry issue, has yet to get off the ground. Currently, the Society awards prizes for resident presentations at the USCAP annual meeting and organizes educational symposia at national meetings, including the IAP, the American Society of Clinical Pathologists, Digestive Disease Week and the international congresses of the International Academy of Pathology. =Current Impact of Gastrointestinal Pathology as a Sub-Specialty= Digestive diseases affect 1 in 5 Americans annually – at least 60 million people in the United States each year. Digestive diseases account for approximately 50 million physician visits, nearly 25 million endoscopic diagnostic procedures and over 20 million gastrointestinal specimens directed to pathologists – representing $87 billion in direct medical costs attributable to gastrointestinal disease. The demand for gastroenterology care and diagnostic procedures continue to increase, driven by an increasing incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the need for colorectal cancer screening in the aging U.S. population. By 2010, gastroenterologists will perform at least 40 million endoscopic procedures annually, translating into $40 billion endoscopy and $12 billion related gastrointestinal pathology expenses annually in the U.S. With less than 400 fellowship-trained gastrointestinal pathologists in practice in the United States, approximately 8% of the 20+ million gastrointestinal biopsies currently performed each year are reviewed by pathologists with fellowship training in digestive health and disease. The remaining 90 to 92% of biopsies are reviewed by highly skilled general surgical pathologists including some who have special interest in gastrointestinal pathology. General surgical pathologists who practice with a focus in gastrointestinal pathology may attend continuing medical education courses offered by fellowship-trained academic and private practice gastrointestinal pathologists, may attend intensive \\"mini-fellowships\\" that are offered by select institutions (i.e. AFIP) to further hone their diagnostic skills and develop close working relationships with gastroenterologists to ensure a broad knowledge base with regards to clinical correlation of the findings under the microscope. Whether a fellowship trained gastrointestinal pathologist, a general surgical pathologist with subspecialty interest in GI or an adept general surgical pathologist is reviewing a particular biopsy or surgical specimen, it is important to keep in mind that the training for the specialty of surgical pathology is rigorous. Following completion of both college and medical school, the surgical pathologist must have also completed an accredited residency in pathology and is board certified in Anatomic Pathology by the American Board of Pathology. Residency in pathology is one of the longest postgraduate training programs, encompassing 4–5 years. (In comparison, internal medicine and pediatrics are only 3 years.) In most instances, gastrointestinal biopsies and surgical specimens represent common diseases that display common histomorphologic patterns, and are accurately evaluated and classified by adept general pathologists. Similar to many aspects of medicine, not all gastrointestinal tissue specimens require sub-specialist review for the accurate diagnosis to be rendered. Internal medicine physicians treat many gastrointestinal conditions without referral to a gastroenterologist specialist. Similarly, many gastrointestinal tissue biopsies and surgical specimens are accurately diagnosed without referral to a gastrointestinal pathologist. Certain diseases are histologically subtle or the differential diagnosis is complicated or complex. In such cases a close working relationship between the pathologist and gastroenterologist with correlation of clinical, endoscopic, and biopsy findings may be of great benefit to the submitting physician and to the patient. Appropriate biopsy classification of GI biopsies is critical. Current literature and other non- published reviews estimate that at least 10% of the diagnoses of Barrett’s esophagus, a precancerous condition, are rendered in error. At least 15 – 20% of stomach biopsies have misclassified disease characteristics, 15% of colon polyps are misdiagnosed, and up to 50% of all cases of chronic inflammatory bowel disease are misdiagnosed or misclassified. Though pathology diagnosis is a critical determinant of future cancer risk and screening interval, many of these diagnoses do not result in significant morbidity or mortality for patients; thus, errors may be \\"masked\\" by the limited effect to the patient in the present context. The economic cost of inaccurate pathology diagnoses can be measured from the perspective of the healthcare system, the gastroenterologist practice and the patient. Within the healthcare system, gastroenterology pathology diagnostic inaccuracy of 10% is equivalent to 2 million misdiagnoses each year. The vast majority of these patients will incur additional medical expenses from repeat clinician office visits; repeat diagnostic procedures, unnecessary enrollment in surveillance programs, and treatment with incorrect or completely unnecessary medications. The cost savings of the correct gastrointestinal pathology diagnosis being rendered at first opportunity by expert board certified surgical pathologists is conservatively estimated within the range of $200M – $1B. Born out of increasing awareness of subspecialty gastrointestinal pathology services, increased marketing efforts by gastrointestinal pathology companies and increased patient awareness of laboratory errors, there is an increasing trend toward referral of tissue specimens to surgical pathologists with special interest in gastrointestinal pathology.

The route is a continuation of Maryland Route 300 (MD 300) from the Maryland border near Everetts Corner. It runs in a northeast direction from there to Smyrna, where it ends at U.S. Route 13 (US 13) while concurrent with DE 6\\\\. Along the way, DE 300 passes through rural areas as well as the towns of Kenton and Clayton. The road intersects DE 44 in Everetts Corner, DE 11 southwest of Kenton, DE 42 in Kenton, DE 15 between Kenton and Clayton, and DE 6 in Smyrna. The road was first built as a state highway in the 1920s and 1930s between the Maryland border and Clayton, with the DE 300 designation given to the road by 1936. The route was extended to its current terminus in the 1950s. Route description DE 300 eastbound in Clayton DE 300 begins at the Maryland border, where the road continues west into that state as MD 300\\\\. From the state line, the route heads east on two-lane undivided Sudlersville Road through agricultural areas and woods with some homes. A short distance after the state line, the road intersects the western terminus of DE 44 in Everetts Corner. DE 300 continues east-northeast through rural areas, passing through the community of Downs Chapel and crossing Jordan Branch. Farther east, the road intersects the northern terminus of DE 11\\\\. The route curves northeast, crossing an abandoned railroad line before entering the town of Kenton. At this point, the road becomes Main Street and passes homes along with a few businesses, intersecting DE 42 in the center of town. Past Kenton, DE 300 continues northeast on Wheatleys Pond Road, passing through more farm fields, some woodland, and residences. The road forms a brief concurrency with DE 15 before heading north and crossing Mill Creek. DE 300 enters the town of Clayton and passes residential subdivisions, curving northeast. The road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade, where it becomes the border between Clayton to the northwest and the town of Smyrna to the southeast, and runs north of industrial areas. The route continues past a mix of homes and businesses, heading into Smyrna and passing northwest of Bayhealth Emergency Center, Smyrna before intersecting DE 6\\\\. At this point, DE 6 turns northeast and forms a concurrency with DE 300 on West Glenwood Avenue. The two routes pass a mix of homes and businesses before gaining a center left-turn lane past the Main Street intersection and entering a commercial area in the northern part of Smyrna as East Glenwood Avenue. Here, the road widens into a divided highway before it intersects US 13\\\\. At this point, DE 300 ends and DE 6 turns southeast to form a concurrency with US 13. DE 300 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 15,378 vehicles at the eastern terminus at US 13 to a low of 2,686 vehicles at the DE 44 intersection. The portion of DE 300 between the Maryland border and DE 44 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, what is now DE 300 existed as an unimproved county road. The road was completed as a state highway between Kenton and Clayton and was proposed as one west of Kenton four years later. By 1931, the entire route between Clayton and the Maryland border was completed as a state highway. DE 300 was designated between the Maryland border and an intersection with DE 6 between Clayton and Smyrna by 1936. By 1954, DE 300 was extended east to its present terminus at US 13 in Smyrna. By the 1990s, DE 6 was routed along DE 300 in Smyrna, bypassing the downtown area.

Personal life Pollock was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on 1909 to Isadore and Sonia (Gordon) Pollock. on 1914, the Pollocks moved to Toledo. Pollock attended public school in Toledo, and graduated on 1926. He attended both the University of Toledo and Bowling Green State University, but did not graduate from either institution. Pollock's daughter, Frances Pollock Packard, died on 1968. He married Sally DeVera Kooperman on April 1934. The couple had a daughter, Frances. During his lifetime, Sam Pollock developed an extensive collection of labor literature. It became one of the largest and most respected private collections of union- related publications in the United States. At the time of his death, the collection numbered about 10,000 volumes that includes books, magazines, journals and other publications on labor history, socialism, communism, and economic and social theory. Many of the works were signed by their authors and most are classified as rare books. Pollock retired on 1973. He and his wife moved to Chatsworth, California. Pollock remained only semi-retired, however. He taught courses in health policy at California State University, Northridge. Pollock died in Chatsworth on 1983. Pollock's grandson is the noted experimental filmmaker Damon Packard.McKinney, \\"Lost In The 70's: The Art of Damon Packard,\\" Frozen Tears 2, 2004. Strike involvement When the Great Depression began on 1929, Pollock became deeply involved in the Ohio Unemployed League,McLaird, \\"Sam Pollock Labor Collection,\\" Archival Chronicle, March 1988. a branch of the American Workers Party (AWP). The goal of the League was to organize jobless workers, advocate for higher relief payments for the unemployed, and help the unemployed resist employer calls to take striking workers' jobs.Hentoff, Peace Agitator: The Story of A.J. Muste, 1982.Bernstein, The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941, 1970. On April 1934, Pollock became a leader in the bitter and violent strike by automobile parts workers at the Electric Auto-Lite plant in Toledo. Pollock and fellow League organizer Ted Selander essentially ran the strike along with AWP leader Louis Budenz. They helped plan mass marches which forced the plant to close. When a local court judge issued an injunction limiting the number of picketers, Pollock and Selander wrote a letter to the judge declaring that the Lucas County Unemployed League would \\"deliberately and specifically violate the injunction enjoining us from sympathetically picketing peacefully in support of the striking auto workers' federal union.\\"The letter in full is quoted in Selander, \\"The 1934 Toledo Auto-Lite Strike,\\" Socialist Action, March 1986. It may be found online at http://www.socialistaction.org/1934toledo.htm (accessed April 7, 2007). Pollock was arrested and convicted for picketing in violation of the court injunction on May 7, but his sentence was suspended. He was arrested again on May 11, but released by the court without any decision in his case. The strike erupted in rioting on May 23. Pollock played a significant, but minor part in the negotiations which helped end the strike on June 2, 1934.Budenz, \\"Strikes Under the New Deal,\\" Challenge to the New Deal, 1934; Fine, The Automobile under the Blue Eagle, 1964. After the strike, Pollock lost his job and was blacklisted for his activities on behalf of the union. Just a few weeks later, Pollock became deeply involved in the Hardin County onion pickers strike. On June 19, 1934, onion weeders formed the first union of farm laborers in the United States, under the auspices of the International Quarrymen's Union. The 30 employers belong to the Onion Growers' Association, refused to recognize or bargain with the union, so the union called a strike. On June 22, a local court judge issued a sweeping labor injunction which restricted picketing in groups of two. Local sheriff's deputies began mass arrests of the picketers for congregating in violation of the injunction.Although picketers were only in groups of two, the sheriff's deputies argued that the groups were too close together. The distance between groups varied from 25 feet to 100 yards, depending on the mood of the deputies. The county sheriff, supplied with funds provided by the employers, hired Ohio National Guard troops who had recently served in Toledo during the Auto-Lite strike, and armed them with riot guns, machine-guns, and tear gas. Protests from Governor George White regarding the use of public equipment for private use were ignored. The troops helped break the strike by forcing workers off the picket lines, and arrests hundreds of workers. When a truck full of replacement workers attempted to run down a group of picketers, the picketers retaliated by throwing stones. Pollock was jailed, and a $1,000 bail set for this incident.The official charges were unlawful assemblage, inciting to riot, and malicious destruction of property. Pollock was held incommunicado for several days. When the local sheriff did tell Sarah Pollock where her husband was, he denied her access to him. When Pollock finally met with his defense attorneys, sheriff's deputies crowded close to listen in the conversations, and physically intimidate the lawyers. The strike ended shortly thereafter without agreement, and the union disbanded.Montross, \\"Stepchildren of the New Deal,\\" The Nation, September 12, 1934; Sternsher, \\"Scioto Marsh Onion Workers Strike, Hardin County, Ohio, 1934,\\" Northwest Ohio Quarterly, Spring/Summer 1986. Union career Pollock was labeled, a radical for his involvement with the AWP and the two strikes, and ostracized from the mainstream labor movement. However, on 1938 Pollock was hired by the Amalgamated Meat Cutters to help organize a new local in Akron, Ohio. This organizing drive was highly successful, and the workers formed Local 372. On 1941, Pollock was appointed a national organizer with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters. Local 372 merged with Amalgamated District 427 on 1950 and moved its headquarters to Cleveland. Pollock and his family moved there as well. On 1951, Pollock was elected president of another Amalgamated Meat Cutters local, the United Food and Communication Workers Union. He held this post until his retirement on 1973. Pollock was appointed Interim District President in 1952, and elected to the position in his own right on 1953. During his tenure, Pollock negotiated a number of progressive collective bargaining agreements. Just a few years after his presidency began, Pollock had negotiated contracts, which limited the work week to 40 hours, and significantly raised wages. Pollock was particularly interested in health care for workers. On 1955, he won establishment of an employer-paid health and welfare fund, one of the first in the nation. On 1964, Pollock successfully negotiated the creation of the Community Health Foundation, a prepaid, direct- service medical care program. A year later, he won an agreement to establish a portable national employer-funded pension plan for all Amalgamated members. On 1958, Pollock helped defeat a right-to-work amendment to the Ohio constitution. During this political battle, he was extremely active on The Committee to Oppose the Ohio Right to Work Amendment.Fenton, \\"The Right-to- Work Vote in Ohio,\\" Midwest Journal of Political Science, August 1959.

Sport as entertainment plays an important role with South Australia having the second highest rate of event attendance of all states and territories with 49% of South Australians aged 15 years and over attending a sporting event each year.Sports attendance in Australia Australian Bureau of Statistics Regional and rural opportunities to participate in sport plays an important role in community life throughout SA. SA has developed a range of programs in supporting inclusive sports pathways focusing on specific populations groups such as indigenous, mature-aged, early childhood, people with disabilities and women. Significant elite sporting events in South Australia include the Tour Down Under, Clipsal 500, Adelaide Cup, International Cricket series and hosting various Australian Swimming Championships. Major events have been shown to bring significant economic benefit to the state. South Australian- based teams are represented in almost all Australian major professional sporting codes including the Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League, the Redbacks and Scorpions in cricket, Adelaide United in the A-League and W-League, Adelaide 36ers in the National Basketball League, Adelaide Lightning in the Women's National Basketball League, and the Adelaide Thunderbirds in the ANZ Championship for netball. The most popular spectator sports in South Australia by attendance are Australian Rules football (31%), motor sports (14%), horse racing (8%), cricket (5%) and soccer (4%). South Australia boasts world-class venues for high performance sport including the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide Super-Drome, Netball SA Stadium, and Hindmarsh Stadium. All major sporting codes within South Australia field representative teams on the national stage. South Australia's official sporting colours are red, blue and gold. Participation Research shows two thirds of South Australians are involved in sport or recreation with around forty percent of those involved, participating in organised sporting activities. Significantly people from regional areas are more likely to participate through a club based structure and are more likely to volunteer and to be a spectator than those in the Adelaide metropolitan area. It is estimated regional communities have an estimated one third of adults participating in exercise recreation and sport via a club or association and almost a quarter are involved as a coach, official, umpire or administrator. Participation rates for males and females are similar and while overall, participation rates decline with age it was more so with males, while women's participation rates remain constant until they are over the age of 65. Research shows walking, running, swimming, aerobics/fitness, golf, lawn bowls, weight training and cycling to be the most popular sports with strong participation by both men and women in South Australia. Historically not all sports have been available to women but that has changed with equal opportunity laws targeting discrimination based on gender. Differences in participation rates by men and women relate to the football codes and netball, which have in the past been limited by opportunities for participation by genders not traditionally associated with the sport. High performance sport South Australia has produced successful Olympians, Paralympians, Commonwealth Games representatives, world champions and national champions across a wide range of individual and team sports. The state has produced successful professional golfers including Jane Crafter and Tamie Durdin, world-class tennis players including Lleyton Hewitt, John Fitzgerald, Mark Woodforde, Darren Cahill, Roger Rasheed and Alicia Molik, and many other successful world champions including squash player Vicki Cardwell and Kylie Halliday in sport aerobics. The establishment of the South Australian Sports Institute in 1982 played a role in supporting elite individuals and team sports. Currently it has high performance programs for rowing, Paralympic, netball, canoe sprint, swimming, cycling, trampoline, diving, volleyball, hockey and water polo and conducts talent search activities throughout the state. Team sports =Australian rules football= Australian rules football is the most popular spectator sport in South Australia with an attendance level (of at least one match per year) of 31% of the population, compared with a national average of 16%.

South Australia also has a domestic men's and women's competition which is strongly supported, the South Australian National Football League. In 1990 a group of women established the South Australian Women's Football League after an exhibition match against Victoria. The league has seen seven of its state representatives making the All-Australian team which is selected from participants at the AFL Women's National Championships. In May 2013, the Australian Football League created a 'draft' for women to form two teams from the top 50 women Australian rules footballers in the nation to participate in an exhibition game before the Round 14 Melbourne versus Bulldogs AFL teams. Many South Australian women chose to nominate. Melbourne Demons drafted Alexandra Price from Port Adelaide FC and Bronwyn Davey from Greenacres FC while Western Bulldogs drafted Courtney Cramey, Morphetville Park. =Netball= Netball is a significant sport in South Australia with a wide range of participation opportunities across metropolitan, regional and rural locations within the state.

South Australia won regularly during the 60's and 70's but in 1985 begun its total domination when it won the first of 11 National Championships in a row. SA Coach Peter Koshnitsky having established a women's lacrosse program with the South Australian Sports Institute helped forge this success in partnership with outstanding leader and Australian & State captain and World Champion, Jenny Williams and other players of this era. The legacy of this era was highlighted by the continued success by South Australian teams at national championship level with success in 1997 and a further run of wins with six in a row from 1999 until 2005. South Australia has produced significant players during this period who have had incredible careers at international level contributing importantly to the 1986 and 2005 IFWLA World Championship victories.

The game traces its roots in the state back to the 1940s, when the Port Adelaide rugby union team split in four, and defected to rugby league. South Australia's only professional rugby league team, the Adelaide Rams, had a short but eventful existence. Originally the Australian Rugby League planned to relocate a Sydney team to Adelaide but the Super League war and the SARL's decision to align themselves with the News Ltd Super League in 1995 shut that idea down. Later in 1995, with Super League still only consisting of nine teams and Melbourne still aligned with the ARL, a decision was made to give Adelaide the 10th Super League license.Rugby League History - RL1908.com - Adelaide Rams Brought into existence for the 1997 Super League season, the team had instant success. In 1998 they were selected to join the 20-team National Rugby League; however, rumours abounded that they were to be axed from the 1999 season as part of a rationalisation of teams (from 20 to 14) in the competition. At present however, the South Australian Rugby League still operates a local semi- professional competition consisting of both junior and adult teams from across Adelaide. =Rugby union= South Australian Rugby Union or \\"SA Rugby\\" is the governing body in the state.

Despite these attacks, Bowen was able to continue to trade in local ports - following his attack on the East Indiaman, Bowen openly towed her into the nearby port of Callicoon and sold her in three shares to local merchants.

The brigantine was found to be useless for piracy and was burned. The Speedy Return was refitted to use against commercial vessels. The Speedy Return and the Content left Maratan together, but on the first night of the voyage, the Content ran aground on a ledge. Unaware of this, Bowen continued to sail for the Mascarene Islands. He expected to find the Rook Galley, as the ship had been sighted there earlier by former members of Drummond's crew. However, the Rook Galley was gone and Bowen decided to sail to Mauritius to look for her. Still unable to find the vessel, Bowen did not attack the ships in the harbour, since he did not know their strength. Instead, he sailed to Augustin Bay, where he met the Content. However, when the Content was examined, he found it to be useless to him and had the vessel burned. The crew came aboard the Speedy Return. In late 1702 Bowen once again met Thomas Howard, who, after leaving Bowen's crew at Madagascar following the loss of the Speaker had, along with a group of pirates, taken the 36-gun Prosperous, at the port of Mayotta. By Christmas, Bowen and Howard decided to join their forces. In March 1703 Bowen had the Speedy Return careened and it was not until the August 1703 that together they attacked and plundered the East Indiaman Pembroke near Johanna Island, one of the Comoros Islands. Bowen and Howard then attacked two Indian ships in the Red Sea, capturing the larger and renaming her Defiant. Return to Rajapura, retirement and death After declaring the Speedy Return and Prosperous unsound, they were burned and Bowen took command of the Defiant. Having also taken a sum of £70,000, Bowen returned to the port of Rajapura where the plunder was divided, and Thomas Howard remained, and then on to the Mascarene Islands where he and 40 others left the Defiant, with his intention being to retire from piracy and to return to Madagascar. However, within six months Bowen died of an unspecified intestinal disease and was buried on Bourbon. Following his retirement, Nathaniel North was elected to replace him as Captain of the Defiant. Bowen's career as a pirate was later profiled by Captain Charles Johnson - commonly believed to be a pseudonym of Daniel Defoe - in A General History of the Pyrates.

In the 2006 census, 4,047 Māori claimed affiliation to Ngā Rauru, representing 12 hapu. History =Early history= The early history of Ngā Rauru kitahī starts before the coming of the Te Kāhui Rere, a Māori tribe that is situated in the South Taranaki area. The iwi takes its name from Rauru Kītahi, a Māori warrior who, after travelling extensively throughout New Zealand, settled in the south Taranaki region. Rauru Kītahi was the first son of Ruarangi and Rongoueroa (see History of Te Āti Awa), and a descendant of Toi-te-huatahi. Awanuiarangi, the founding ancestor of Te Āti Awa, was Rauru's half-brother. =Tribal and land wars= In the early 19th century, northern iwi including Ngā Puhi and Ngāti Toa fought other Māori iwi in campaigns throughout the North Island, armed with European muskets. Ngā Rauru came under attack from Ngāti Toa in 1822, and from Ngāti Tuwharetoa in the 1840s. Initial trade relations with Europeans were profitable. However, in the 1850s divisions emerged within tribes across Taranaki over land sales to the government. This eventually led to the New Zealand Wars, starting in Taranaki. As a result, 607 square kilometres was confiscated from Ngā Rauru by Crown troops. In 1868, Ngā Rauru supported the Ngāti Ruanui leader Tītokowaru against Crown troops. In response, Crown troops destroyed and confiscated more Ngā Rauru land, devastating the economy of the iwi. Subsequent loss of control of Ngā Rauru land occurred through improper land title acquisitions by the New Zealand Government. Some redress was attempted by the New Zealand Government. Some land was returned to Māori control, but under perpetual lease by the Public Trustee, and ignoring traditional collective Māori title. The Sim Commission of 1926-1927 attempted to compensate Taranaki iwi including Ngā Rauru, but this was seen by many iwi as insufficient, conducted with little or no consultation with Taranaki iwi. Ngā Rauru today =Crown settlement= In 1991, Ngā Rauru submitted its claims to the Waitangi Tribunal. In 1996, the tribunal released The Taranaki Report: Kaupapa Tuatahi, which examined past government attempts at redress.The Taranaki Report: Kaupapa Tuatahi In 2000, Ngā Rauru entered into negotiations with the New Zealand Government towards a Deed of Settlement. The final settlement was ratified and signed on 27 November 2003. The settlement included: *A formal acknowledgement and apology for crown violations of the Treaty of Waitangi *An agreed historical account of Ngā Rauru during the New Zealand Wars *Cultural redress through rights to land management and rights-of-first-refusal to purchase government-owned land *Financial compensation totalling NZ$31 million. =Administration= The Ngā Rauru Iwi Authority manages the affairs of the iwi and represents it in negotiations with the New Zealand Government. With the Deed of Settlement now concluded, Ngā Rauru are moving ahead with economic development and plans to revitalise Māori language use. In particular, the Matauranga Unit of the Ngā Rauru Iwi Authority was established to compile, collect and preserve information pertaining to whakapapa and the Deed of Settlement, as part of a larger effort to revitalise Ngā Rauru culture, history and identity. =Radio station= Te Korimako O Taranaki is the radio station of Ngaa Rauru Kiitahi and other Taranaki region iwi, including Ngati Tama, Te Atiawa, Ngāti Maru, Taranaki, Ngati Mutunga, Ngati Ruanui, Ngāruahine. It started at the Bell Block campus of Taranaki Polytechnic in 1992, and moved to the Spotswood campus in 1993. It is available on across Taranaki.

The route intersects DE 300 in Kenton, DE 15 between Seven Hickories and Moores Corner, and U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Cheswold. The road was built as a state highway during the 1920s and 1930s. DE 42 was designated by 1936 between Kenton and Leipsic and extended to Blackiston by 1966. Route description DE 42 eastbound past US 13 in Cheswold DE 42 begins at an intersection with DE 6 in Blackiston. Northwest of DE 6, the road becomes Longridge Road, which changes names to Delaney Maryland Line Road and Clayton Delaney Road before it reaches the Maryland border and becomes Maryland Route 330 (MD 330). MD 330 heads west into Kent County, Maryland and, by way of MD 313, provides access to US 301\\\\. From the western terminus, DE 42 heads southeast on two-lane undivided Blackiston Road. The route runs through agricultural areas with some woods and homes. The road reaches the town of Kenton, where it becomes Commerce Street. In Kenton, the route crosses an abandoned railroad line and passes residences and a few businesses, intersecting with DE 300 in the center of town. Past Kenton, DE 42 heads to the east-southeast on Seven Hickories Road into farmland with woods and residences, crossing Pinks Branch. In Seven Hickories, the route intersects DE 15 and the two routes head east for a concurrency. In Moores Corner, DE 15 splits from DE 42 by turning southeast on Kenton Road before DE 42 continues east and intersects Pearsons Corner Road. The road heads east-northeast and passes to the south of Delaware Airpark. The route enters the town of Cheswold, where it becomes Main Street. The road passes homes and some businesses in the town, crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade. DE 42 reaches an intersection with US 13 on the eastern edge of Cheswold at Bishops Corner. After the US 13 intersection, the route heads northeast on Fast Landing Road. DE 42 passes over the DE 1 toll road, where it has ramps for emergency vehicles but no public access. The road runs through farmland with some woodland and homes, curving to the east. Farther east, the route turns southeast into marshland adjacent to the Leipsic River, crossing Dyke Branch. DE 42 enters the town of Leipsic, where it heads east into residential areas and ends at DE 9\\\\. Past the eastern terminus, the road continues east as Second Street. DE 42 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 7,654 vehicles at the eastern border of Cheswold to a low of 536 vehicles at the eastern terminus at DE 9. None of DE 42 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, what is now DE 42 existed as an unimproved county road. The road was completed as a state highway between Kenton and Lepisic four years later. The route was under construction as a state highway between Blackiston and Kenton by 1932. By 1936, DE 42 was assigned to its current alignment between DE 300 in Kenton and DE 9 in Leipsic and the state highway between Blackiston and Kenton was completed.

Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship, or simply the Maxwell Institute, is a research institute at Brigham Young University (BYU) made up of faculty and visiting scholars who study and write about religion, primarily The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The Institute's namesake, Neal A. Maxwell, is a former LDS apostle, known by Latter-day Saints and others for his writings and sermons. The mission statement reads: \\"The Maxwell Institute both gathers and nurtures disciple-scholars. As a research community, the Institute supports scholars whose work inspires and fortifies Latter-day Saints in their testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and engages the world of religious ideas.\\" The LDS Church identifies the Maxwell Institute as one of several third-party church affiliates offering gospel study resources.  History  The Maxwell Institute was established in 2006 as an umbrella organization for several of the BYU's academic initiatives, including: the Middle Eastern Texts Initiative (METI), the Center for the Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts (CPART), the Laura F. Willes Center for Book of Mormon Studies, and the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS). By 2013, FARMS had become fully absorbed into the Institute's Willes Center. In 2012, debate was sparked when the Maxwell Institute's then-director, Gerald Bradford, removed Daniel C. Peterson from a long-time editorship of the FARMS Review shortly after it had been renamed the Mormon Studies Review. Peterson retained his position as editor of the Middle Eastern Texts Initiative (METI) until resigning in September 2013. Under new leadership following Bradford's retirement in 2015, the Maxwell Institute underwent a series of internal and external reviews to determine its future direction. J. Spencer Fluhman was appointed director in 2016 and the Maxwell Institute began restructuring. Together with BYU administration and a new advisory board, Fluhman announced a new mission statement in March 2018. As part of this restructuring, METI was transferred to the international publisher Brill. CPART completed its final project in 2017. The Institute also published the Mormon Studies Review from 2013 through 2018 when complete ownership was transferred to the University of Illinois Press. In November 2018, BYU announced plans to move the Maxwell Institute to a new facility closer to the center of campus. The Faculty Office Building will be replaced by the new West View Building, which is scheduled for completion in spring 2020. The Maxwell Institute will temporarily be housed in BYU's Clyde Building until construction is complete.  Scholarship  The Maxwell Institute provides research positions for full-time faculty, visiting scholars, post- doctorate researchers, and other temporary research fellows who study the LDS Church, as well as Christianity and other religions more broadly. Institute scholars occasionally publish in-house, but most of their work is placed in other venues. The Maxwell Institute also includes two initiatives: # Laura F. Willes Center for Book of Mormon Studies, which deals principally with the Book of Mormon in ancient and modern settings, in addition to other LDS scripture. # William (Bill) Gay Research Chair, which focuses on study directly related to the ancient world and LDS scripture, particularly the Book of Abraham (the chair's current occupant is Egyptologist John Gee). The Maxwell Institute frequently sponsors guest lectures at BYU, as well as symposia, workshops, and conferences on religious topics. Wednesday Brown Bag discussions allow scholars to workshop current projects, prepare for conference presentations, discuss recently published works, and examine the dimensions of \\"disciple-scholarship.\\" The Maxwell Institute also employs a small staff of office assistants, communications personnel, and a large number of student interns. = Criticisms of objectivity in light of Institute's non- independent status = Commentator Michael Austin, reflecting on the Institute's status as an officially sanctioned venue for Latter-day Saint theological studies, opined that resources cited within the Institute's 2019 Study Edition of the Book of Mormon are \\"carefully curated to include only official Church sources and scholarship that supports the [LDS] Church’s conclusions,\\" adding that he believes that \\"the Church has produced and authorized a version of its signature scripture that is orders of magnitude more helpful, and more scholarly, than anything it has produced before. But officialness comes at a cost. Official books must tell official stories, which means that honest discussions of controversies and pressure points—no matter how important they may be to the study and interpretation of the text—cannot become part of the apparatus. Commentator John H. Brumbaugh opined, \\"In a sense, New Mormon historians challenge the foundational beliefs of Mormonism in a quest for professional rigor. [...] Faithful historians never challenged foundational beliefs; instead they are intended to build the devotion of Church members. BYU Studies and Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship are prime examples of Faithful history outlets. Renouncing objectivity, these organization functioned to 'Describe and defend the Restoration through highest quality scholarship.'\\"”  Publications  Although the Maxwell Institute is not primarily a publisher, it maintains a publishing imprint and produces a handful of books and periodicals each year for both general and academic readers. Periodicals include the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies (published in partnership with the University of Illinois Press) and Studies in the Bible and Antiquity (currently on hiatus). Other books include the \\"Living Faith\\" series. One of the Maxwell Institute's notable past publications is Royal Skousen's Book of Mormon Critical Text Project. Work from the Critical Text Project was incorporated into the Maxwell Institute Study Edition of the Book of Mormon, edited by Grant Hardy and published in partnership with BYU's Religious Studies Center and Deseret Book in 2018—the first study edition of the scripture ever published by an official Church affiliate. The Maxwell Institute Podcast features interviews with resident and visiting scholars and lecturers of the Maxwell Institute. In the past it has also featured religious and textual scholars from a variety of religious traditions beyond the Institute, including N. T. Wright, Marilynne Robinson, Martin Marty, and James Kugel.

The term \\"Tianqi\\" (天啓; \\"tenkei\\" in Japanese) is a reference to the era name of the reign of the Tianqi Emperor (r. 1621-1628) in the late Ming Dynasty, but the style and the name are not limited to his reign. Over the same period the related Transitional porcelain was being made. Generally speaking, Tianqi porcelain was one variety of porcelain among various styles of the Jingdezhen unofficial kilns from a time of production breakdown of the official kilns at the death of the Wanli Emperor in 1620 to a time of reorganization in 1683 during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing Dynasty. The Tianqi ware, and other associated wares, display a refreshing spontaneity of design that makes them unique in Chinese ceramic history. The influence of the master landscape artist Dong Qichang (董其昌) (1555-1636) can be discerned in the use of a dark and light color contrast. Designs for this ware are usually landscapes, birds and flowers, animals and human figures. Sizes are usually small to mid-size flatware and bowls. Many examples of the ware were treasured in Japan as part of the tea ceremony culture. Many examples of this ware show an unmistakable Japanese influence and it is thought that they were especially ordered from Japan by period tea masters. This ware is also known in Japan as ko sometsuke (古染付け) or “old blue-and white.” Base inscriptions are usually those from previous reigns in the dynasty with a preference for the Chenghua reign mark.

It is a fictional roadside diner on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona, that serves locals and truckers. It has a counter, two large booths and a couple of tables. Although one of the three waitresses, Alice, is the main character, the show revolves around all of the waitresses and Mel Sharples, the owner and cook. Most scenes of the show take place in the diner as well. The diner setting is so intertwined with the show that the series itself is often referred to erroneously as \\"Mel's Diner\\". Throughout the run of the series, Mel's Diner has a reputation, especially among its regular customers, for serving terrible food, though, more often than not, this is meant to be a joke. Mel's is noted for its gourmet chili, which is referred to as \\"Mel's Famous Chili\\". In the episode 'Sharples vs Sharples', Mel's mother, Carrie (Martha Raye), publishes a cookbook with Mel's chili recipe in it and the two fight about whose recipe it really is. Carrie takes it out of the book because Mel claims \\"it's mine, mine, mine\\". The outside shot of the diner's sign with the giant coffee cup sometimes seen in the opening credits of Alice is of a real Mel's Diner (1747 NW Grand Avenue) in Phoenix.\\"Phoenix visitors relive TV history at Mel's Diner\\", Associated Press in USA Today, December 17, 2010. The sign was seen by a producer scouting Phoenix for an establishing shot. It had been \\"Chris’ Diner\\" but the owner agreed to change the name to \\"Mel's\\" for the show and is called the same to this day. In the \\"Mel Spins His Wheels\\" episode, Alice informs a customer that the diner's address is 2128 Bush Highway. However, in a subsequent episode (\\"Big Bad Mel\\"), the diner's address is given as 1130 Bush Highway.

The highway began as the Plank and Gravel Road, a toll road formed by the Ingersoll and Port Burwell Road Company. It was first assigned in 1930. Several extensions in the early 1930s took the route north to Highway 86 at Tralee. However, a significant amount of Highway 19 was decommissioned and turned over to local and county governments in 1997 and 1998.  Route description  The southern end of Highway 19 begins at Highway 3 in Tillsonburg, while the northern end terminates 400 metres north of the centreline of Highway 401, southeast of the Ingersoll town limits. Highway 19 is situated entirely in Oxford County and serves the communities of Ostrander, Mount Elgin and Salford. Prior to 1998, it began in Port Burwell on the shores of Lake Erie, while the northern terminus extended to Highway 86 east of Listowel in the community of Tralee. The route begins on the southern edge of Tillsonburg at Highway 3 (Talbot Road), travelling north along the eastern side of Big Otter Creek. This section of the highway, known as Vienna Road, lies next to a business/industrial park. At County Road 51 (Simcoe Street), Vienna Road ends and Highway 19 turns west, becoming Oxford Street and crossing Big Otter Creek. At Broadway Street, Highway 19 turns northwest and passes through the downtown strip as well as beside Tillsonburg Town Centre. It continues into residential subdivisions, eventually exiting the town into the municipality of South-West Oxford as it turns north at Quarter Town Line and becomes Plank Line. The route enters farmland, but bisects the hamlet of Ostrander shortly thereafter. It crosses the Ontario Southland Railway, which lies roughly parallel to the entire length of the highway, before passing west of Tillsonburg Airport and curving northwest. After travelling through farmland, the route enter Mount Elgin and intersects County Road 18 (Mt. Elgin Road). After, it continues through more farmland to the community of Salford, where it encounters County Road 46 (Salford Road). It turns northward briefly, emerging back into agricultural surroundings for the final stretch of the route. Just southeast of Ingersoll, it encounters an interchange with Highway 401 (Exit 218); Highway 19 ends immediately north of the westbound ramps. County Road 119 (Harris Street) continues northwest into the town to meet former Highway 2.  History  The history of Highway 19 dates back to 1849, when the Baldwin Act and the Act to Authorize Formation of Joint Stock Companies were passed. George Tillson, his sons, and his brother-in-law Benjamin Van Norman were the principal stockholders of the Ingersoll and Port Burwell Road Company, which they formed along with approximately 200 shareholders in September 1849\\\\. Proceeding quickly, the company established eight toll booths along the new route, which became known as the Plank and Gravel Road due to the materials with which it was constructed. However, the greed of toll road operators resulted in diminishing upkeep, which forced the province to enact legislature allowing counties to assume ownership of the roads. It took until 1907 for Oxford County to assume the toll road; the proprietors were compensated with $15,500 ($ when adjusted for inflation from 1916). The gradual implementation of various legislation over the following decade allowed many counties to vastly improve roads under their jurisdiction. By the time the Department of Highways (DHO) assumed the road from Highway 3 in Tillsonburg to Highway 2 in Ingersoll on March 12, 1930 as King's Highway 19, it was once again a gravel road. A year later, on May 27, 1931, the highway was extended north from Woodstock to Shakespeare. As a result of this, a concurrency with Highway 2 was created between Ingersoll and Woodstock. Several months later, on July 1, the department assumed the remainder of the Ingersoll to Port Burwell Road, extending Highway 19 south of Tillsonburg. As part of a depression relief program, the DHO and Department of Labour undertook several projects in 1933 and 1934, one of which included the Stratford to Tralee Road. On July 4, 1934, the DHO assumed the road as part of Highway 19\\\\. To remedy the discontinuity, a concurrency with Highway 7 was established. At this point, Highway 19 had grown from its original length of to . The route remained unchanged until the early 1960s, when several highways were renumbered. Highway 19 between Woodstock and Shakespeare was redesignated as Highway 59, while Highway 100 between Thamesford and St. Marys was redesignated as Highway 19\\\\. The concurrencies with Highway 2 and Highway 7 were relocated as a result of this renumbering; Highway 19 became concurrent with Highway 2 between Ingersoll and Thamesford, and with Highway 7 between St. Marys and Stratford. While the length of the route was reduced insignificantly as a result of this renumbering, it became more direct. Between then and 1997, no changes were made to Highway 19\\\\. On April 1, 1997, the section from Highway 3 south to Port Burwell was transferred to Elgin County, Oxford County and Haldimand–Norfolk. This was followed by a second round of transfers on January 1, 1998, which resulted in the section north of Highway 401 being decommissioned and assumed by Oxford County and Perth County. Today, the majority of the Port Burwell to Tillsonburg segment is designated as Elgin County Road 19\\\\. A short segment in Haldimand–Norfolk and Oxford County immediately south of Tillsonburg is designated as County Highway 19\\\\. The Ingersoll to St. Marys segment is now known as Oxford County Road 119, while the segment north of Stratford is designated as Perth County Road 119 through Brunner, then Perth County Road 131 through Milverton.

Function  Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. This kinase has been reported to play roles in many different cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, cell transformation, cell cycle checkpoint, and cell volume control. Knockout studies in mice suggest that this kinase may be a fundamental regulator of cardiac contractility and Ca2+ handling in myocytes. Protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-α) is a specific member of the protein kinase family. These enzymes are characterized by their ability to add a phosphate group to other proteins, thus changing their function. PKC-α has been widely studied in the tissues of many organisms including drosophila, xenopus, cow, dog, chicken, human, monkey, mouse, pig, and rabbit. Many studies are currently being conducted investigating the structure, function, and regulation of this enzyme. The most recent investigations concerning this enzyme include its general regulation, hepatic function, and cardiac function.  Regulation  PKC-α is unique in its mode of regulation compared to other kinases within this family. In general, the protein kinase family is regulated by allosteric regulation, the binding of a modulating molecule that effects a conformational change in the enzyme and thus a change in the enzyme's activity. The primary mode of PKC-α's regulation, however, involves its interaction with the cell membrane, not direct interaction with specific molecules. The cell membrane consists of phospholipids. At warmer temperatures, phospholipids exist in a more fluid state as a result of increased intramolecular motion. The more fluid the cell membrane, the greater PKC-α's activity. At cooler temperatures, phospholipids are found in a solid state with constricted motion. As phospholipids become stationary, they assume a particular orientation within the membrane. Phospholipids that solidify at an irregular or angled orientation with respect to the membrane, can reduce PKC-α's activity. The composition of the cell membrane can also affect PKC-α's function. The presence of calcium ions, magnesium ions, and diacylglycerols (DAGs) are the most important because they influence the hydrophobic domain of the membrane. Varying concentrations of these three components constitute a longer or shorter length of the hydrophobic domain. Membranes with long hydrophobic domains result in decreased activity because it is harder for PKC-α to insert into the membrane. At low concentrations, the hydrophobic domain is shorter allowing PKC-α to readily insert into the membrane and its activity increases. Example of DAG Regulator, long carbon-hydrogen tails increase the hydrophobic domain of the cell membrane and decrease PKC-α's activity  Secondary structure  Using infrared spectroscopy techniques, researchers have demonstrated that the secondary structure of PKC alpha consists of around 44% beta sheets and nearly 22% alpha helices at 20 °C. Upon addition of calcium ions, a slight increase in beta sheets to 48% was observed. Additional ligands normally associated with PKC alpha, such as PMA, ATP, and phospholipids had no effect on secondary structure. The structure of PKC alpha was better preserved during denaturation of the enzyme at 75 °C in the presence of calcium ions than in their absence. In one study, beta sheet composition only decreased by 13% with calcium ions present compared to 19% when absent.  Role  = Epithelium = Another field of research has indicated that PKC-α plays a vital role in epithelial tissue, the tissue that covers all external and internal surfaces of the body. Specifically, PKC-α is involved in altering the function of tight junctions. Tight junctions exist at the meeting point between two cells. Here, tight junctions fuse together to form an impermeable barrier to not only large molecules such as proteins, but also smaller molecules like water. This prevents foreign molecules from entering the cell and helps regulate the internal environment of the cell. Cells infected with certain types of epithelial cancer exhibit increased PKC-α activity. This is a result of a change in the shape of the cell membrane, particularly in the areas where tight junctions exists. With greater activity of PKC-α, the tight junctions lose their ability to form a tight barrier. This causes an increased leakiness of the tight junctions and thus movement of molecules into the cells. In intestinal areas, luminal growth factors are able to enter the cell and increase the rate of cell growth. This is thought to be a promotional event that may prolong certain epithelial cancers. PKC family of proteins and their role in tight junctions = Liver = Much of the research of PKC alpha pertaining to its role in liver tissue involves the effects of bile acids on the phosphorylation mechanism of the PKC family of proteins. Past research has affirmed that the bile acid CDCA inhibits the healthy glucagon response through a phosphorylation-related sequence. In related studies further testing the effects of CDCA on hepatocytes, CDCA was shown to have induced PKC translocation to the plasma membrane. PKC alpha was favored in this process over PKC delta. The implications of this finding are that increased interaction between the glucagon receptor and PKC alpha could occur. = Heart = PKC alpha is one of the lesser studied proteins of the PKC family because it is not highly regulated in the serious medical condition known as acute myocardial ischemia, which results from a lack of blood supply to the myocardium (heart muscle tissue). Recent research into the role of PKC alpha in cardiac tissue has indicated that it has an important role in stimulating hypertrophy. This was demonstrated by the ability of agonist- mediated hypertrophy to be stopped only as a result of the inhibition of PKC alpha in an experiment in situ. However, in further in vivo research using mice, the transgenic overexpression of PKC alpha showed no effect on cardiac growth, and the inhibition of PKC alpha showed no effect on hypertrophic response to increased cardiac pressure. On the contrary, research has shown that removing PKC alpha altogether improved the hearts ability to contract. In summary, research is pointing in the direction that PKC alpha's role in cardiac tissue has more impact as a regulator of contractility than of hypertrophy. In another study, the binding peptides, RACK and others derived from PKC beta, were expressed in mouse hearts. The genetic code for these proteins are similar to those of all isoforms of the PKC family (alpha, beta, and gamma). As such, RACK and other proteins can regulate the expression of all PKC family proteins. In this particular study, however, only PKC alpha was affected. Again, overexpression caused decreased contractile performance, whereas inhibition saw increased performance. = Memory and PTSD = The scientists led by neuroscientist Dominique de Quervain of the University of Basel in Switzerland used memory tests and DNA studies to conclude that people who carried a particular DNA signature in at least one copy of a gene that encodes protein kinase C alpha had stronger memory than their peers; and brain scans of people with the genetic signature show stronger brain activation in parts of the prefrontal cortex compared with those who lacked the genetic feature. The team looked at the Rwandan refugees who had survived the 1994 genocide and found that the risk of PTSD in the refugees with strong memory signature is twice of that in the refugees without the genetic signature. = Cell membrane = Typical Reaction Scheme of PKC alpha PKC-α shows important regulation of phospholipase D. Phospholipase D is located on the plasma membrane and is responsible for hydrolyzing phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid and choline. Research has indicated that phospholipase D may play roles in tumorigenesis by altering cellular events such as invasion and migration. Point mutations at particular phenylalanine residues have shown to inhibit PKC-α's ability to activate phospholipase D. Current research is being conducted investigating PKC-α's inhibitory affects. Researchers hope to learn how to exploit PKC-α's ability to turn down phospholipase D's activity and use this function to create anti-cancer drugs. Another breakthrough branch of research concerning PKC-α concerns its role in erythrocyte (red blood cell) development. Currently, researchers understand that PKC-α is correlated with the differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells in bone marrow. These undifferentiated cells give rise to the mass of red blood cells present in blood. Future research endeavors seek to find whether it is activation or inhibition of PKC-α which affects the development of erythrocytes. By answering this question, scientists hope to gain insight into various types of hematologic diseases such as aplastic anemia and leukemia.  Pathology  Increased activation of PKCα is associated with the growth and invasion of cancers. High levels of PKCα are linked to malignant brain cancer. Moreover, a high proliferation rate of glioma tumor cells is the result of overexpression of isozyme PKCα.  Interactions  PKC alpha has been shown to interact with: * C1QBP, * CD29, * EGFR, * FSCN1, and * OGG1.

He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. He was born in New Delhi and educated at Rutlish School in Merton, south London.At Rutlish, he came to prominence by winning the Daily Telegraph Young Bowler of the year award in 1986, taking 94 wickets including 10 wickets for 30 runs against Wallington Grammar School. Boiling's first-class career began in 1988, when he was signed by Surrey after appearing for them in the Second XI the previous year. This came straight off the back of appearing in all eight of the England Young Cricketers' appearances in the 1988 Youth Cricket World Cup. In this tournament, Boiling was one of the most successful bowlers, with a best performance of 3 wickets for 7 runs against Pakistan. Boiling also starred for the Combined Universities in their 1989 run to the quarter finals of the Benson and Hedges Cup, during which they defeated Surrey and Worcestershire. Boiling's figures of 3 wickets for 9 runs from 8 overs against Surrey earned him the Gold Award. He became a regular member of the Surrey first team during the 1991 season, during which they reached the final of the NatWest Trophy. Boiling excelled in the semi-final, scoring 22 runs, taking 2 wickets for 22 runs, and taking a spectacular catch to dismiss Allan Lamb that was described by Richie Benaud as \\"one of the best catches you will ever see.\\" After a successful 1992 season, in which he took 45 first-class wickets including match figures of 10 for 203 against Gloucestershire, Boiling toured with the England A team to Australia. Although he played second fiddle to Peter Such, he took 3 for 93 against Tasmania, including Ricky Ponting for a duck. His 3 for 19 against Northern Territories included the wicket of Matthew Hayden. He was unlucky to have his toe broken whilst batting at the MCG against an Australian Academy XI, which effectively ended his chances of international selection. However, Boiling enjoyed a successful one-day season in 1993, taking 25 wickets in the 50 over AXA League and in 1994 helped to propel Surrey to the semi-finals of both the NatWest trophy and Benson and Hedges Cup. However, this was to prove his final year in the side, as he signed to Durham in time for 1995. During 1995, Boiling hit his highest first-class score of 69 against a West Indies attack which featured Ian Bishop and Ottis Gibson and took two five-wicket hauls, the second of which (5 for 73) helped to win the game against Nottinghamshire. Boiling played with decreasing regularity during the 1996 and 1997 seasons, although he remained in the Limited Overs side until the 1998 season, which was his last. Boiling will be remembered as a successful one-day bowler but he was not quite a big enough spinner of the ball to make a real impact on the batsman-friendly surfaces at the Oval or the seamer's pitches in the North East. A fine gully fielder, Boiling was a useful lower-order batsman who was a regular night-watchman. In this role he played probably his finest innings, of 62, against a Derbyshire attack including Devon Malcolm and Phillip DeFreitas. A partnership of 204 for the third wicket with Jonathan Lewis was instrumental in securing victory. On leaving cricket, Boiling qualified as a secondary school teacher.

The game was released for the PlayStation 2. Gameplay There are three options available at the main menu, single player, multiplayer and an options menu that allows players to modify gameplay elements such as difficulty and view unlocked items achieved during gameplay. Initially, the player is introduced to six fictional racers displayed at the top of a mountain once single player mode is selected from the main menu of the game. By pressing the select button over an unlocked racer, additional info of the racer will be displayed, and by pressing the select button over a locked character which is represented by a statue, valuable info on how to unlock, the same will be displayed such as a specific career to finish. In addition to two other fictional racers, players can also unlock real-life professional racers like Eric Carter and Tara Llanes when specific tournaments are finished during gameplay. Combat is also integrated into the game, in which the player can use two buttons to attack other racers, one for a left attack, and the other for the right. These attacks can be upgraded to more powerful attacks by performing tricks, taking out opponents, or collecting power-ups (known in-game as \\"pickups\\"). A bike shop with several unlockable items to purchase is available but is only accessible in one player mode. Up to four players can play the game, but when playing with more than two, the available tracks and modes are limited.

It was first published in 1655, fifteen and thirty years after the deaths of its authors. Date Scholars generally agree that the existing text of the play is a Massinger revision of an earlier work, though they disagree as to whether that earlier version was a Fletcher/Massinger collaboration or a work by Fletcher alone. (Cyrus Hoy favoured the latter view.) So the original must have predated Fletcher's death in 1625; lacking hard data on this point, scholars have estimated a date of authorship in the 1619–22 period. The play entered the historical record when it was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 6 June 1634; it is not improbable that Massinger's revision of the text shortly preceded that licensing. No firm information on the play's early stage history has survived; it is more likely than not that the play was acted by the King's Men, the company that performed most of the solo works of Fletcher and Massinger and their collaborations as well. Early in the Restoration era, A Very Woman received a revival production in Oxford (1661).Garrett, p. 11. Publication A Very Woman first appeared in print when it was included in an octavo volume titled Three New Plays, issued by Humphrey Moseley in 1655; the volume also contained Massinger's plays The Guardian and The Bashful Lover. (This 1655 volume appears to unite the final three surviving works of Massinger's dramatic career.) When Moseley entered the play into the Stationers' Register on 9 September 1653, he gave it a different subtitle, calling it A Very Woman, or The Woman's Plot. This alternative subtitle is found nowhere else, and there is no \\"woman's plot\\" in the play; but a play with the title The Woman's Plot was acted at Court on 5 November 1621.The Woman's Plot was one of the Massinger plays destroyed by John Warburton's cook. Moseley employed the possibilities for confusion inherent in play titles and subtitles to register two plays for a single fee – which appears to be what he did in this case.Oliphant, pp. 95–6, 251. (For other examples of Moseley's trick, see The Bashful Lover, The Guardian, and The Lovers' Progress.) Authorship The original edition attributed the play to Massinger alone. Nineteenth-century scholars devoted much attention to the study of the canon of Fletcher and his collaborators, including the plays of Fletcher and Massinger. In the context of that general study, A Very Woman attracted attention; F. G. Fleay was the first commentator to recognise Fletcher's presence. Given Fletcher's highly distinctive textual and stylistic preferences, scholars have found it easy to distinguish between the two authors in the extant text. Their respective shares break down this way: : Massinger — Act I; Act II, scenes 1, 2, and 3a (to Duke's exit); Act IV, 2; Act V; : Fletcher — Act II, scene 3b (from Duke's exit); Act III; Act IV, 1 and 3. Massinger's friend Sir Aston Cockayne borrowed heavily from A Very Woman for his own play The Obstinate Lady (published 1658).Logan and Smith, p. 232. The uncertainties of the play's origin led early critics astray in one particular. The name of the character Cardenes led some to wonder if A Very Woman had some connection with the lost play Cardenio, attributed to Fletcher and Shakespeare.Phelan, pp. 50–1; Oliphant, pp. 251–2. One early reference to Cardenio uses the \\"Cardenes\\" spelling. Modern critics dismiss any connection between the two. Speculation has also linked A Very Woman with the lost play The Spanish Viceroy. Sources The dramatists' primary source for their story was El amante liberal (1613) by Miguel de Cervantes; Massinger's revision was influenced by Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy.Logan and Smith, pp. 47 and 103. The work was also influenced by The Mirror of Knighthood.Gill, pp. 136–48. The Mirror of Knighthood was a translation and continuation of a Spanish romance, Del espeio de principes y caballeros, published in nine volumes between 1578 and 1601. It was enormously popular in its time, though one of the type of extravagant romances that inspired Cervantes' satire in Don Quixote. The first volume of The Mirror was translated by Margaret Tyler, in an era when literary work of any kind by a woman was rare. Synopsis The play is set in Palermo in Sicily, in Massinger's era – during the Spanish Habsburg rule of southern Italy. The plot involves the intertwined marital fortunes of the younger generation of two prominent families – those of the (otherwise unnamed) Viceroy of Sicily and Duke of Messina. The Viceroy has a son, Don Pedro, and a daughter, Almira; the Duke has a son, Don Martino Cardenes, and a niece, Leonora. The two couples, Pedro and Leonora and Cardenes and Almira, are in love and hope to be married. One source of contention clouds their matchmaking: another wealthy and prominent nobleman and a close friend of Pedro's, Don John Antonio, the Prince of Tarent (or Taranto, in southern Italy), had come to the Viceroy's court in Palermo with great display and expense, hoping to win the hand of Almira. She, however, has refused his suit in favour of Cardenes, and none too subtly or gently. As the play opens, Antonio has asked permission to pay his farewell respects to Almira; but in her arrogance she refuses this last courtesy. Pedro protests her rudeness, but Cardenes, an insecure and touchy young man, supports her decision. He goes a step further, confronting the departing Antonio, picking a quarrel with him, and striking him. The two draw their swords, and Antonio inflicts a severe and almost fatal wound upon Cardenes. Antonio is arrested and confined to prison – but his friend Pedro helps him escape. Cardenes survives his wound but endures a long convalescence and a bout of deep depression; Almira, burdened with grief and guilt, is sometimes hysterical, and those around her fear that she is losing her sanity. The Duke of Messina is incensed that Antonio has escaped the Viceroy's authority, and suspects collusion, though Pedro denies it. The Duke has Leonora accompany Almira in her convalescent seclusion, to keep her away from Pedro; both women are put under the watch of a court functionary named Cuculo and his wife Borachia. Antonio returns to Palermo, but appears in the slave market in the guise of a Turk; he is purchased by Cuculo and becomes a household servant, where he impresses everyone with his manners and breeding. Borachia thinks he must be the son of the Turkish sultan. In his slave guise, Antonio acts as the go- between for Pedro and Leonora. Both Cardenes and Almira are enduring their own versions of recovery from mental stress; Cardenes is under the cure of a prominent physician, while Leonora helps Almira regain her emotional balance. Almira loses some of her arrogance and acquires a measure of humility and sense; she also develops an infatuation with the Turkish slave who is really Antonio, her spurned suitor. When pirates break into Cuculo's house and attempt to abduct Almira and Leonora, Antonio plays a crucial role in fighting off the would-be kidnappers and rescue the two women. But while their fathers are expressing their gratitude, Almira provokes her father by announcing that she is in love with the Turkish slave. The irate Viceroy sends the man to prison, but Almira refuses to back down, saying that she will inflict upon herself whatever torture he suffers. The matter is resolved once Antonio reveals his true identity. Cardenes is now fully cured, restored to physical and mental health – but the court is astonished when Cardenes rejects the idea of marrying Almira. His near-fatal wound, his long convalescence, and his depression have given the young man a more mature and austere view of life, and he has turned away from egotism and sensuality. With Antonio substituted for Cardenes, the two couples who began the play can proceed to the altar. The comic relief in the play involves subjects – alcoholism and slavery — that are now generally considered questionable sources of humour. Borachia is an alcoholic, who turns aggressive and caustic when drunk; one of the slaves is an Englishman who has lived in France and absorbed French manners, a source of amusement for the play's original audience. On the more serious side, the drama displays Massinger's strong interest in medical and psychiatric matters and especially in the subject of clinical depression and its treatment. Samuel Taylor Coleridge reportedly once called the piece \\"one of the most perfect plays we have\\"T. Ashe, ed., Table Talk and Omniana of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, London, George Bell, 1888; p. 201. — an extreme of enthusiasm that no other commentator has matched. Notes References  * Garrett, Martin.

Established in 1949, the Shidler College of Business is named after The Shidler Group's Jay H. Shidler, founder and managing partner of The Shidler Group, a Honolulu-based company focused on commercial real estate and credit-related investments. In 2014, Mr. Shidler increased his initial gift of $25 million to $100 million, making it the largest donation at the University of Hawaii from a private donor. The Shidler College of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), and offers a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), a Master of Business Administration (MBA) (Full-time and Part-Time), a Master of Accounting, a Master of Human Resource Management, an Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA), and a Doctor of Philosophy in Business Administration (PhD).

Shidler also offers a Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship. For 2015, U.S. News & World Report ranked Shidler amongst the nation's top business schools. Shidler's international business program was ranked 18th best. History Hawaii experienced rapid social and economic growth during the post-World War II period. To meet the challenges presented by this growth, the Hawai‘i state government alongside many state businesses encouraged the University of Hawai‘i to establish a College of Business to develop the state's future business leaders. In 1949, the University of Hawai‘i at Manoa College of Business Administration opened its doors to a small group of business students in the historic Hawaii Hall building. While the College's initial curriculum provided a strong foundation to develop business leaders, its scope was limited to accounting, economics, and industrial relations. With Hawaii's sustained growth, the College also grew. In the early 1960s, the College recruited top business professors to help strengthen the existing program. Additional changes included strengthening the College in the area of liberal arts, requiring each student to minor in economics, and offering a general business program in fields such as management, finance, personnel, and statistics. In 1967, the College received national accreditation from Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), whereby placing it amongst the nation's best business schools. With 1,300 students enrolled in the mid-60's, it became clear that the College was outgrowing its existing space at Hawai‘i Hall. In 1969, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare provided a grant while spurred the construction of a new building. In the fall of 1971, the College moved into its new facility. In the next few years, the College continued to grow at an alarming rate almost doubling its size by the late 1970s. In the mid-'70s to the early '90s, the College matured and gained worldwide recognition for its international business focus. Faculty members with expertise in Asian business were heavily recruited; foreign and United States mainland students with an interest in international studies were applying in greater numbers and exchange opportunities with international universities were created. In 2006, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents voted to accept a $25 million donation from alumnus and founder of The Shidler Group, Jay H. Shidler, naming the College after him as the Shidler College of Business. In 2014, Jay H. Shidler extended his commitment to the College to $100 million, making it the largest donation to the University of Hawaii from a private donor. Mr. Shidler’s unique gift of ownership interests (leased- fees) in various land parcels across the U.S., as well as cash gifts, in-kind gifts and marketable securities, will generate income in perpetuity to meet the College’s long-term financial needs.

Peter Sumner returns to the role of Imperial Officer Lt. Pol Treidum, whom he played in Star Wars. An attempt was made to submit the film to an official fan film contest in 2003 that was sanctioned by George Lucas, however the short was not considered to be eligible as it was set prior to the events of Episode IV: A New Hope, which violated the contest's rules by adding new content to the series, which Lucas also considered to be a copyright violation. The film was briefly removed from the Internet at Lucas' request.  Synopsis  Set just before the events of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, the film tells of how Mara Jade (a character from the Star Wars expanded universe) worked with other Rebels to capture the plans for the first Death Star. While on the mission, though, Mara hears the Emperor's call to turn to the dark side of the Force. Other crucial moments in Star Wars history are explained in this film, such as how Han Solo got in trouble with Jabba the Hutt.  Cast  * Damian Rice ... Zev Senesca * Jason Chong ...

While the neighbourhood didn't develop until the 1960s and 1970s, the area is closely associated with the Town of Beverly, a working class community that amalgamated with Edmonton in 1961. A number of the Beverly coal mines were located in the area.  Demographics  In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, Rundle Heights had a population of living in dwellings, a -1.4% change from its 2009 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of people/km2 in 2012.  Residential development  Shortly after arriving in Canada in 1927, a Dutch immigrant named Jacob Prins bought a farm east of Beverly in the area that is now Rundle Heights, and which included one of the larger coal mines in the Edmonton Area.The Humberstone Coal Mine The farm would grow to . In the 1950s, the Prins family tried strip mining coal near the river on the eastern side of the property. The venture proved unsuccessful. In 1956, the City of Edmonton bought the site of the strip mine and used it for the Beverly Dump, a place to dispose of the city's refuse and garbage. The Prin's farm ceased production in 1966, and most of the land was subdivided for the Rundle Heights neighbourhood. With the neighbourhood encroaching on the Beverly Dump, and the dump reaching the end of its useful life, the city reclaimed the dump site for parkland. Today, Rundle Park and the Rundle Golf Course occupy the area once known as the Beverly Dump. The stretch of 32nd street that runs in the northern part of the neighborhood contains numerous public housing developments. The 3-2 Bloods are a set of the Bloods gang that operate in the area. However, this area is a small portion of the neighborhood at large. The neighbourhood is bounded on the north by 118 Avenue, to the west by 34 Street (north of 111 Avenue) and 36 Street (south of 111 Avenue) and by the river valley to the south and east. Surrounding neighbourhoods are Abbottsfield to the north, Beacon Heights to the north west, and Beverly Heights to the west. There are two schools in Rundle Heights. The Rundle Heights Elementary School is operated by the Edmonton Public School System and St. Jerome Catholic Elementary School is operated by the Edmonton Catholic School System.  Mining  The Town of Beverly was a coal mining town with over twenty mines operating in the area during the town's history. The following major mines were active in the area of Rundle Heights. * Humberstone Coal Mine * Old Bush Mine * Bush's Mine  References   Further reading  * Herzog, Lawrence, \\"Built on Coal, A History of Beverly, Edmonton's Working Class Town\\", Beverly Community Development Society, 2000, Edmonton, Alberta Category:Neighbourhoods in Edmonton ","title":"Rundle Heights, Edmonton"},{"id":"10743094","text":"Stephen George \\"Steve\\" Pratt (born 15 October 1949) is a former Australian military officer, aid worker and politician in the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. He wrote a book titled Duty of Care about his life experiences, including being unjustly imprisoned in Serbia while tending to the refugee crisis there in 1999.  Early career  Pratt spent the late 1990s working for the foreign aid organisation CARE Australia. Prior to that, he had a 23-year career as a Military Officer in the Infantry of the Australian Army, seeing service throughout the Asia/Pacific region. He worked in dangerous front-line locations including Rwanda, Cambodia, Zaire, Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, as well as in Yemen, Jordan and Kenya, managing up to 32 international aid workers and 2000 local staff. In 1993 and 1994 Pratt worked as a senior manager in northern Iraq alongside the UN dealing with the humanitarian problems that followed the Gulf War. He and his colleagues came under fire from Ba’athist Fedayeen as well as religious extremists. = Iraq spying allegations = Allegations that Pratt used the cover of humanitarian work to undertake spying activities for the United Nations in Northern Iraq during 1992 and 1993 were published in The Sunday Telegraph of 11 April 1999. Reportedly, Pratt's activities became known to the Iraqi Government and a price was apparently placed on his Head. The allegations were later found to have been inadequately verified by the Australian Press Council.The secret past of Aussie aid worker; By KATRINA CREER; THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH [Sydney, Australia]; 11 April 1999, Sunday; FULLPAGE, LOCAL; Pg. 20; reprinted at http://emperors- clothes.com/archive/telegraph.htmhttp://www.presscouncil.org.au/pcsite/adj/1039.html/ This accusation was attributed to media sensationalism while Pratt was being held in prison in Yugoslavia at the time. =Yugoslav spying allegations= In 1999 whilst evacuating Yugoslavia, Pratt, fellow Australian Peter Wallace and Yugoslav Branko Jelen, were arrested by Yugoslav authorities and accused of spying for NATO and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Pratt was forced at gunpoint to participate in a video confession, which was broadcast worldwide. After spending 5 months of a 12-year sentence in jail (including use of physical and emotional torture) in Yugoslavia, he was pardoned as innocent and released in September 1999 by former Serbian Leader, Slobodan Milosevic after appeals for clemency, just in time to return home for his daughter's birth. An investigation in 2000 by journalist Graham Davis of the Australian SBS network suggested an arrangement between CARE Canada, part of the CARE Federation, and the Government of Canada, a NATO member, to recruit a team of people, including former military personnel, to help monitor events in Kosovo during the Yugoslav civil war.http://www.nettime.org/Lists- Archives/nettime-l-0002/msg00088.html It was also revealed that former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, who was then CARE Australia's Chairman, and Graham Davis had known of the agreements with CARE Canada and the Canadian Government during the time of Pratt's jailing, but had agreed not to reveal any of the details for fear of jeopardising the release of Pratt, Wallace, and Jelen. Political career On 20 October 2001 Pratt was elected to the ACT Legislative Assembly as a Liberal MLA for the electorate of Brindabella. He was re-elected in the 2004 election. In September 2007, he became the Shadow Minister for Urban Services, Transport, and Emergency Services and Multicultural affairs. He was defeated in the 2008 Legislative Assembly election. = Political views = Pratt's political views are generally focused on law and order, ACT Government school closures, road safety, infrastructure needs in the ACT, the needs of the residents of Tharwa, including upgrades to the Tharwa Bridge, and opposition to the proposed gas- fired power station and data centre.  Disdain for public art and graffiti removal  Pratt gained notoriety for an ill-conceived campaign against graffiti and vandalism. In April 2007 he 'cleaned up' a legal mural that had been funded by a local disc (frisbee) golf club at Eddison Park, Woden, under a program intended to prevent unauthorised graffiti and vandalism. Despite being told by ACT Government officials prior to removing the mural the work was considered to be art, Pratt considered the work \\"obnoxious\\" and removed it anyway. The matter was later referred to the Australian Federal Police for further investigation. On 15 August 2008, Pratt released a media release describing a new 11 metre tall outdoor wind activated kinetic sculpture commissioned by the ACT Government as 'unnecessary', and a potential traffic hazard for motorists. He stated that he had hoped the construction he had observed would have yielded another light pole or traffic sign, and not a piece of public art.http://the- riotact.com/?p=8418http://www.canberraliberals.org.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?art_id=335&nav;_cat_id=171&nav;_top_id=55 Other achievements Pratt has the following decorations: the National Medal, the Defence Force Service Medal, the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal (clasps: Iraq; Great Lakes (Africa); Balkans), and the Australian Service Medal (South East Asia). He is the author of Duty of Care, an account of CARE Australia's emergency overseas work 1993–1999 and his ordeal under detention, in the former Yugoslavia, during the NATO conflict. In 2002, he obtained his Bachelor of Professional Studies (BPS) through the University of New England, specialising in \\"International Community Development\\" (ICD). He is married to Samira and has two children, Haydon and Yasmina.

A wilderness park, it derives its name from Cape Chignecto, a prominent headland which divides the Bay of Fundy with Chignecto Bay to the north and the Minas Channel leading to the Minas Basin to the east. The park, which opened in 1998, is the largest provincial park in Nova Scotia. It also anchors one end of the UNESCO Cliffs of Fundy Global Geopark.Francis Campbell, \\"Nova Scotia's Cliffs of Fundy designated UNESCO Global Geopark site\\", Halifax Chronicle Herald, July 10, 2020. Landscape The park's landscape is renowned for spectacular shoreline with extensive backpacking trails and scenic day hikes. The highest cliffs in Mainland Nova Scotia are located along the park's southern coast, measuring 200 metres (600 ft). The park occupies and has of wilderness coastline with unique geological features such as raised beaches, caves and sea stacks. The complex geology was created by continental collision along the Cobequid fault. The spectacular coastal landscapes of the park make it popular for hikers and kayakers. It also contains several abandoned logging camps, saw mills and the ghost towns of Eatonville and New Yarmouth. A secluded ravine named Refugee Cove was the site where Mi'kmaq sheltered fleeing Acadians during the Expulsion of the Acadians. The mixing of warm summer temperatures with the cold tidal waters of the Bay of Fundy create frequent fogs resulting in moist rain forest like conditions which nurture \\"fog forests\\" of large red spruce and many unique and endangered species of lichens. The park's high southern cliffs support species of vetch and primrose with Alpine characteristics which are unique in Nova Scotia.\\"Cape Chignecto: Incredible Coastline\\", Interpretive Guide and Map, (2005) Nova Scotia Dept. of Natural Resources Cape Chignecto also provides shelter for Nova Scotia's endangered mainland moose herd. Tides rise and fall 12 metres along the park's coastline, producing rip currents and rapid flooding at certain points. Several hikers have been trapped and had to be rescued when rising tides trapped them against sheer cliffs, including a couple and a dog who had to be rescued from rising waters at Eatonville by a helicopter from CFB Greenwood in July 2014. Facilities The park maintains over 50 kilometres of trails, both for day use hikers and overnight backpackers. An interpretation centre, picnic area, washrooms and giftshop are based at the trailhead at Red Rocks near the community of Advocate Harbour. In addition to 51 back country campsites and 28 walk-in sites, several overnight cabins and bunk houses on the trail system may be rented by hikers. A mothballed fire tower, closed since 2012, is located at the highest point of the park in New Yarmouth.\\"Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources Fire Towers\\", Maritimes Scanning Site A new, off-grid interpretation centre and day use trails at Eatonville were constructed in 2008-2009.

History of the park The Government of Nova Scotia purchased the land currently comprising the park in 1989 and added it to the Crown land reserve, administered by the Department of Natural Resources. This land was redesignated for a provincial park in the mid-1990s and Cape Chignecto Provincial Park opened to the public in 1998 after several years of planning and trail and campsite development. By area, Cape Chignecto is the largest provincial park in Nova Scotia. Although Cape Chignecto is Nova Scotia's largest provincial park and is owned administered by Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources, it was created, and until 2012, run by a local community development organization, the Cumberland Regional Economic Development Association. The park was operated by a very small seasonal staff based in Advocate and Amherst, Nova Scotia. However, in the spring of 2012 the Department of Natural Resources took over management of the park and brought its fees in line with other provincial parks.

Gross examination or \\"grossing\\" is the process by which pathology specimens are inspected with the bare eye to obtain diagnostic information, while being processed for further microscopic examination. Gross examination of surgical specimens is typically performed by a pathologist, or by a pathologists' assistant working within a pathology practice. Individuals trained in these fields are often able to gather diagnostically critical information in this stage of processing, including the stage and margin status of surgically removed tumors. The initial step in any examination of a clinical specimen is confirmation of the identity of the patient and the anatomical site from which the specimen was obtained. Sufficient clinical data should be communicated by the clinical team to the pathology team in order to guide the appropriate diagnostic examination and interpretation of the specimen - if such information is not provided, it must be obtained by the examiner prior to processing the specimen. There are usually two end products of the gross examination of a surgical specimen. The first is the gross description, a document which serves as the written record of the examiner's findings, and is included in the final pathology report. The second product is a set of tissue blocks, typically postage stamp-sized portions of tissue sealed in plastic cassettes, which will be processed into slides for microscopic examination. Since only a minority of the tissue from a large specimen can reasonably be subject to microscopic examination, the success of the final histological diagnosis is highly dependent on the skill of the professional performing the gross examination. The gross examiner may sample portions of the specimen for other types of ancillary tests as diagnostically indicated; these include microbiological culture, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or electron microscopy.

Synopsis  The novel centres on a single father and his children: Anna, his natural daughter; Claire, who was adopted as a baby when Anna was born; and Cooper (Coop), who was taken in \\"to stay and work on the farm\\"Ondaatje (2007) Divisadero at the age of four when orphaned. The family lives on a farm in Northern California where Anna and Claire are treated almost as twins, while Cooper is treated more as \\"a hired hand\\". After Anna begins a sexual relationship with Coop, an incident of violence tears the family apart. The book then details each of the characters' separate journeys through life post-incident and how they are all interconnected. Later in her life, Anna moves to France to live in a farmhouse once owned by the French poet Lucien Segura whom she is researching. Meanwhile, Claire works for a law firm in San Francisco while visiting her father on the weekends, and Coop becomes a professional gambler working his way up and down the West Coast of the United States. The second part of the story explores the story of the French poet, which has a number of close parallels to the first part of the story.  Style and structure  The novel starts with Anna as narrator, but some sections have a third person omniscient narrator. It is divided into three parts: * One: Anna, Claire and Coop * Two: The family in the cart * Three: The house in Dému = Anna, Claire and Coop = This part introduces the family members and their childhood to the reader. It ends with the narration of what made the family break apart: Anna and Coop begin an affair which is discovered by their father who starts beating Coop. Anna, who knows that her father is about to kill Coop, attacks her father. Finally he takes her with him and drives away. A little later, Coop comes to himself and returns to the family's farm house where Claire heals his wounds and he goes away as well. = The family in the cart = Claire stays with her father who never talked about what happened when Anna and Coop disappeared. She starts working for a lawyer but she still visits her father at the weekends. Anna managed to escape from her father at a rest stop and hitch-hiked to France where she begins with her research about Lucien Segura after a friend of her brought her the last rest of the way to Dému. She starts a relationship with her neighbour Rafael who had known the poet. Coop accompanies with a group of gamblers and befriends with them. After one of them dies, the group divides and Coop starts a tuition to become a hustler. They cheat at cards in a game with some gambler rivals and got busted. He terminates his carries because his reputation is ruined and begins an affair with a woman who turns out to have financial problems with violent guys who want him to win some money with gambling. He refuses. A while later Claire, who he met a few days before, finds him. This part also goes back to Rafaels childhood and tells how he and his family met Lucien Segura when they were looking for a new place to live. = The house in Dému = The last parts centers on the story of Lucien's teenage years, and how he got married and how he survived the war. Finally he realizes that the life with his wife was not the life he wanted and he starts out for Dému.  Themes  Ondaatje said in an interview with Ramona Koval that He goes on to say that he was exploring how strong this nuclear family is, albeit not blood-related, and how \\"they have to kind of deal with the rest of their lives with this one moment of trauma\\".

She was named for her mother.(2006) American Experience: John and Abigail Adams. PBS Paramount.  Romance and marriage  At the age of 18, Nabby met and fell in love with Royall Tyler. Her father thought she was too young to have a suitor, but he eventually accepted it. At one point the two were even engaged to be married. But John Adams, then the U.S. minister to the Kingdom of Great Britain, eagerly called for his wife and daughter to join him in London. For a time, Nabby maintained a long-distance relationship with Tyler, but eventually broke off the engagement, leaving Tyler depressed. Colonel William Stephens Smith Shortly afterward Nabby met Colonel William Stephens Smith, who was serving as her father's secretary and was 10 years her senior. They would later be related by marriage—Col. Smith's sister was the wife of Nabby's brother Charles Adams (1770–1800). They were married at the American minister's residence in London on June 12, 1786.Nagel, Paul C. 1987. The Adams women: Abigail and Louisa Adams, their sisters and daughters.

Journal and correspondence of Miss Adams, daughter of John Adams, second president of the United States, written in France and England, in 1785. book Their courtship was thought to be too short by Nabby's parents, and historians have not considered it to be a good marriage. While Colonel Smith was kind to his family, he never settled, continually seeking a better lot in life. He spent more money than he earned and lost everything to real estate speculation in the early 1800s. This left them on a small farm along the Chenango River in central New York. Their children were:  Diagnosis of breast cancer  In 1810, Nabby was diagnosed with breast cancer. On October 8, 1811, a mastectomy was performed by John Warren. The operation was performed by Warren and several assistants without any anesthesia in an upstairs room of the Adams home. Her mother, husband, and daughter, Caroline, were also on hand to assist. = The surgery = The exact details of the surgery are not known but it was described as a typical 19th century operation. The instruments used during the surgery consisted of a large fork with a pair of six-inch prongs sharpened to a needle point, a wooden-handled razor, a small oven filled with heated coals, and a thick iron spatula. Before the surgery began Dr. Warren strapped \\"Nabby\\" into a chair to restrain her, and then began to remove the clothing to expose the area on which he would operate. Once the diseased breast was exposed, other physicians held her left arm back so that Dr. Warren would have better access to the diseased tissue. He began the surgery by thrusting the large fork into her breast and lifting it from the chest wall. He then sliced at the base of the breast until it was completely severed from her chest. After removing the breast, he saw that the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes under Abigail's arms, and he worked to remove those tumors as well. To stop Abigail's bleeding, Dr. Warren applied the heated spatula to cauterize the open cuts, and then sutured the wounds. The surgery took around 25 minutes, but dressing the wounds took more than an hour. Warren and his assistants later expressed astonishment that Abigail endured the pain of the surgery and cauterization without crying out, despite the gruesomeness of the operation, which was so horrifying it caused her mother, husband, and daughter to turn away.  Death  About seven months after the surgery, in 1812, Abigail finally started to feel well once more. So she then returned home to New York where she subsequently began feeling pain in her abdomen and spine, as well as suffering from painful headaches. At first a local doctor in New York said that the pain was from rheumatism, but later in 1813 new tumors began to appear in the scar tissue as well as on the skin. She then returned to her parents' house to die; she died in August 1813 at the age of 48. She was buried at Hancock Cemetery in Quincy.  Depictions in popular culture  Nabby's death is a poignant part of the 2008 John Adams miniseries, in which she is played by Sarah Polley; Nabby Adams as a young girl was played by Madeline Taylor in the first three episodes of the same series. The series took artistic license by shifting Abigail's cancer diagnosis to 1803, and changing many other aspects of her life.  Mount Vernon Hotel Museum and Garden  The Abigail Adams Smith Museum, now known as the Mount Vernon Hotel Museum and Garden, was a carriage house was built in 1799 by a wealthy New York china merchant on property purchased from Abigail and her husband Col. William Stephens Smith. The carriage house was purchased by Joseph Hart and converted into a day hotel. Day hotels were popular at the time as they provided the burgeoning New York middle class an escape from the overcrowded and oppressive city. It was called the Mount Vernon Hotel after George Washington's home in Virginia and functioned in this capacity from 1826 to 1833. The property changed hands again when it was purchased by Jeremiah Towle. It served as the Towle family's private residence until 1905 when, with the spread of industrialization, it was purchased by Standard Gas Light Company. The building was preserved until its ultimate purchase by the Colonial Dames of America in 1924. In 1939, the building was opened to the public as the Abigail Adams Smith Museum. The Colonial Dames of America reinterpreted the house as a day hotel and reopened it as the Mount Vernon Hotel Museum and Garden in 2000. It remains open to the public with museum tours daily (except Monday).  Family tree  Notes  References   External links  *Nagel, Paul.

Its rohe (tribal area) extends from Waihi in the north, to the Kaimai Range in the west, to south of Te Puke in the south, and to Tauranga in the east. The rohe does not extend offshore to Matakana Island or Mayor Island / Tuhua. Ngāti Ranginui is part of the Tauranga Moana iwi group, which also includes Ngāti Pūkenga and Ngaiterangi. The three iwi all consider Mauao (Mt Maunganui) sacred and share many things in common. Collectively, the iwi are seeking compensation from the New Zealand Government for their losses from the New Zealand Wars but are yet to seek a settlement. History Ranginui is the founding ancestor of the iwi. In Tauranga traditions, Ranginui was the son of Tamatea-pokai-whenuaSome traditions identify Tamatea-pokai-whenua as the grandson of Tamatea Arikinui, while others indicate that these names represent the same person - see Tākitimu from the TakitimuSo spelled in Tauranga traditions canoe. Ranginui was the brother of Kahungunu (the founding ancestor of Ngāti Kahungunu) and Whaene. His brothers eventually moved to other regions of the North Island, while he remained in Tauranga, settling along the Wairoa River. His descendants would eventually form the Ngāti Ranginui iwi. In 1864, the Tauranga Moana iwi collectively fought against Crown troops stationed in Tauranga. A notable victory occurred at Gate Pā, but eventually thousands of hectares of land was confiscated. Ngāti Ranginui continues to seek redress with the New Zealand Government for their losses in the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s, together with the other Tauranga Moana iwi. Governance Ngāti Ranginui Iwi Society Inc is the Tūhono organisation of Ngāti Ranginui. It is an incorporated society, governed by one representative from each of ten marae. As of 2016, the chairperson Tawharangi Nuku, the chief executive is Stephanie O'Sullivan and the trust is based in Tauranga. Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Ranginui Settlement Trust is a governance entity recognised by the New Zealand Government since the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the iwi and the Crown on 21 June 2012. It is a common law trust, governed by eight trustees elected by member hapū plus an independent chair. As of 2016, the trust chairperson is Te Pio Kawe and the trust is based in Tauranga. Ngāti Ranginui Fisheries Trust is the mandated iwi organisation of Ngāti Ranginui under the Māori Fisheries Act, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the Māori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act and a Tūhono organisation. It is a charitable trust governed by seven trustees elected from the iwi whānui. As of 2016, the trust chairperson is Christopher Stokes and the trust is based in Tauranga. The iwi has interests in the territory of Bay of Plenty Regional Council, Western Bay of Plenty District Council and Tauranga City Council. Media Moana Radio is the radio station of Ngati Ranginui and the other Tauranga Moana iwi. It is available on and in Tauranga and across the Bay of Plenty.

Heisey Company was formed in Newark, Ohio, in 1895 by A.H. Heisey. The factory provided fine quality glass tableware and decorative glass figurines. Both pressed and blown glassware were made in a wide variety of patterns and colors. The company also made glass automobile headlights and Holophane Glassware lighting fixtures. The company was operated by Heisey and his sons until 1957, when the factory closed. Heisey glassware is readily identifiable by its high clarity and brilliance. It is highly finished through the process of firepolishing, with polished bottoms. Many of the pressed pieces appear to be cut crystal on casual inspection, due to the high quality of the glass and the crispness of the molding. The majority of the pieces are impressed with the company logo, a raised capital letter \\"H\\" inscribed in a diamond of approximately 1/4 inch (6 mm) in length. This mark is found on the bottom of most large pieces and on the base or stem of drinking glasses and compotes. Heisey glass is highly collectible and widely available in antique stores across North America and online auctions such as eBay. Popular pattern names include Crystolite, Greek Key, Empress, Plantation, Ridgeleigh, Stanhope, Old Sandwich, and Yeoman, amongst dozens of others. Heisey glass was produced in colors throughout the life of the factory, but the most prolific period of color manufacturing was from 1925 to 1938, when the most collectible colors were created. The company went to great lengths to produce distinct colors, and Heisey glass may often be identified from the specific colors alone. In 1925, Flamingo (a pastel rose-pink) and Moongleam (a vivid green) were introduced and produced in large quantities. Marigold is a brassy gold- yellow color. Sahara, which replaced Marigold, is a satisfying soft lemony yellow color. Hawthorne is a lavender color. Tangerine, a bright orange-red produced from about 1933, was part of a trend to darker, more vivid colors. During this time, a Cobalt color called Stiegel Blue was also produced. Alexandrite is the rarest of Heisey colors; it can be a pale blue-green under normal light, but in sunlight or ultraviolet light, it glows with a pink- lavender hue. Zircon is a very modern grey-blue and was the last new color introduced. uranium milk glass) souvenir cup from Hansboro, likely from the decade prior to World War I. Heisey Glassware: The Early Years: 1896-1924 Heisey is believed to have made a few pieces in milk glass in its early production years and likely produced vaseline glass as well in the early 1920s, although not in large quantities. At the time the factory closed, the Imperial Glass Company bought the molds for the Heisey glass production and continued producing some pieces mostly with the Imperial Glass mark until they went out of business in 1984. Many of these pieces were animal figurines, mostly in new or original colors using the old molds. National Heisey Glass Museum Enthusiasts of Heisey Glass formed the Heisey Collectors of America in 1971. In 1974, the group founded the National Heisey Glass Museum, located in Veterans Park in downtown Newark, Ohio. The museum is housed in the 1831 Samuel D. King home, which features a Greek Revival style. The museum maintains a significant collection of Heisey glass. Exhibits display examples of hundreds of patterns and all known colors, as well as such workmanship as cuttings, etchings, engravings, and experimental pieces. Other displays show the company's glass manufacturing process through molds, tools, etching plates, factory designs, and samples. In addition to the exhibits, the museum features a media center, company archives (with many original molds), a library, and a gift shop. When the Imperial Glass Company went out of business in the 1980s, the club purchased the Heisey molds and established an archive. The Heisey Collectors of America occasionally reproduces pieces from the original molds, for fundraising purposes, that are sold in the gift shop.

Their legions dominated the North Africa area and brought five centuries of relative peace and progress to coastal Libya. Roman influence was huge in Tripolitania, where the main city (Leptis Magna) was home to one of the most illustrious Roman Emperors, Septimius Severus. In those five centuries of Roman domination the area around Oea, Sabratha and Leptis Magna enjoyed good agriculture and commerce, and was defended by the Limes Tripolitanus. Cyrenaica, by contrast, was Greek before it was Roman. It was also known as Pentapolis, the \\"five cities\\" being Cyrene (near the village of Shahhat) with its port of Apollonia (Susa), Arsinoe (Taucheira), Berenice (Benghazi) and Barca (Marj). From the oldest and most famous of the Greek colonies the fertile coastal plain took the name of Cyrenaica. The Legio III Augusta was in control of coastal Libya during the Roman Empire, and by the third century was made partially of Libyan natives. Romans, in order to defend coastal Libya, made war against the Garamantes (living in actual Fezzan) and made expeditions to the desert area south of Libya.  Late Antiquity and Islamic conquest  Cyrenaica remained under East Roman (Byzantine) control, while Tripolitania fell under the Vandals in the mid-5th century. The Byzantines conquered the Vandal Kingdom in the Vandalic War of 533–534, including Tripolitania. The province was plagued over the next two decades by warfare between the Byzantines and the local Berber tribes, most notably the Leuathae. The Berbers were subdued however by John Troglita in the 540s. As part of the Muslim conquest of Egypt, Cyrenaica was conquered in 642, and in 643 the Arabs took the eastern parts of Tripolitania and sacked Tripoli. In 647 an army of 20,000, led by Abdallah ibn Sa'ad, penetrated into western Tripolitania and Tunisia. In a 15-month campaign, the Arabs raided the Exarchate of Carthage and defeated and killed its ruler, Gregory. The campaign was intended as a raid rather than for conquest, however, and Ibn Sa'ad's force returned to Egypt after Gregory's successor Gennadius gave them a huge tribute in gold.  Spanish and Ottoman Conquest  By the 15th century Libya was a haven for pirates. Habsburg Spain occupied Tripoli in 1510. Because the Spaniards were concerned with controlling the port instead of administering a colony, Charles V took Tripoli and in 1528 gave it to the Knights of St John of Malta. In 1538 Tripoli was reconquered by a pirate king called Khair ad-Din and the coast became renowned as the Barbary Coast. The Ottomans arrived to occupy Tripoli in 1551, they saw little reason to rein in the region. It would be more than two centuries before the pirates' control of the region was challenged.  Barbary Wars  Philadelphia aground off Tripoli, in 1803. The First and Second Barbary Wars were a series of military conflicts between the North African States and the United States. The sovereign authorities in these states demanded that all ships crossing or using their harbors pay duties and tax when traveling in their sovereign waters in the Mediterranean Sea. When the United States refused to pay, merchant vessels were seized by local Tripolitanian authorities and their crews were held for trial for trespassing. The United States government responded by deploying its navy to region along with the Marines to combat the North African state of Tripolitania. This was the first overseas conflict of the United States. Both the Barbary Wars resulted in American victories. Some Libyans claim \\"victory\\" as the ship USS Philadelphia (1799) was deceived and lured, then captured by Libyans. They cite continued harbor duty payments as evidence. The USS Philadelphia (1799) stayed until 1804 when the matter was resolved.  Italo-Turkish War  The Italo-Turkish War was a Colonial War fought between the Ottoman Empire and Italy from 29 September 1911 to 18 October 1912. Italy seized the Ottoman provinces of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, together forming what (later in 1934) became known as Libya. Some Libyans believe that the Ottoman Empire \\"sold\\" Libya at the treaty of Lousanne in order to survive a few years more. Libyan resistance was fierce and one of the top leaders was Sa'adon Al Swehli, but some Libyans fought on the Italian side.  Resistance against Italy  After the Italian victory, Omar Mukhtar organized and devised strategies for the Libyan resistance against the Italian colonization. Mukhtar was skilled in desert tactics. He knew his country’s geography and used that knowledge to his advantage in battles against the Italians. Mukhtar led his guerrilla fighters in some successful attacks against the Italians. His twenty-year struggle came to an end when he was wounded in battle and captured by the Italian army with the help of Libyan colonial troops. Mukhtar was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be executed by hanging in a public place. Italian forces were able to erase the remaining resistance and even create the Italian Libyan Colonial Division with native Libyans, that fought for Italy in the 1936 conquest of Ethiopia and received a \\"Gold Medal of Honor\\" for distinguished performance in battle.Medal of Military Honor Other Libyan forces in the Italian Army included the Savari.  World War II  More than 30,000 Libyans fought in the Italian Army from 1940 to 1943. There were two divisions of Arab-Berber troops (1st Libyan Division Sibelle and 2 Libyan Division Pescatori) that fought in World War II for the Fourth Shore of Italy. Even a battalion of Arab Libyan paratroopers was raised shortly before World War II, the first force of this kind to be created in all Africa.Full analysis of the initial Italian attack with references to the Libyan paratroopers They trained in Castel Benito, near Tripoli, where the first \\"Italian Military Parachute School\\" was located (the first troops trained were two Libyan battalions, the Libyan Parachute Battalion and the 1st National Libyan Parachute Battalion,Libyan Paratroopers of the Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali della Libia (Royal Colonial Corps). King Idris I on the cover of the Libyan Al Iza'a magazine, August 15, 1965 During World War II, the Senussi Idris supported the United Kingdom and brought some Cyrenaican nationalists to support the Allies against the Axis, which had occupied Libya. With the defeat of the German- Italian Army under Erwin Rommel, Idris was able to return to Benghazi: in 1951 was proclaimed King of Libya.  Coup d'etat  To the chagrin of Arab nationalists at home and supporters of Pan-Arabism in neighbouring states, King Idris maintained close ties with the United Kingdom and the United States, even after they intervened against Egypt during the 1956 Suez Crisis On 1 September 1969, a small group of military officers led by Muammar Gaddafi staged a coup against King Idris. The new regime headed by the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Libya a republic.  Yom Kippur War  The 1973 Yom Kippur War was the fourth major conflict between Israel and the neighboring Arab States. Libya was among the many Arab nations to contribute to the war with both military and financial aid. During the Yom Kippur War, Libya sent squadrons of Mirage fighters and gave Egypt around $1 billion in arms.  Libyan-Egyptian War The Libyan-Egyptian War was a border war between Libya and Egypt in July 1977. Tensions between the two countries had increased during April and May as demonstrators attacked the embassies of both countries. On 21 July 1977 gun battles between troops on the border began, followed by land and air attacks. A ceasefire was agreed to on 24 July. Libyan casualties were 400 dead or wounded while Egyptian casualties were 100 dead or wounded.  Uganda-Tanzania War  During the 1978 Uganda- Tanzania War, Muammar Gaddafi sent 3,000 troops to aid Idi Amin's government. However the Libyans soon found themselves on the front line, while behind them Uganda Army units were using supply trucks to retreat. Tanzanian and UNLA forces met little resistance and invaded Uganda.  Gulf of Sidra Incident  The lead F-14 has just destroyed the last remaining MiG-23 In the Gulf of Sidra incidents, fighters from the United States Navy F-14 Tomcats engaged in combat against fighters from the Libyan Air Force. During both events the United States Navy F-14 Tomcats defeated the Libyan Air Force. In the first Gulf of Sidra incident, two United States Navy F-14 Tomcats from the USS Nimitz engaged and shot down two Libyan Su-22s off of the Libyan coast. The second Gulf of Sidra incident occurred in 1989 when two United States Navy F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan MiG-23s that appeared to be attempting to engage them.  Chadian-Libyan conflict  The Chadian-Libyan conflict was related to the possession of the Aouzou Strip and was marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war. The Chadian government had the support of the French, and rival Chadian factions who united against the Libyan army. In the final Toyota war Libya was defeated. According to American sources Libya lost 7,500 men and 1.5 billion dollars in military equipment.  Second Congo War  The Second Congo War was a major conflict in Africa between 1998 and 2003. It was one of the bloodiest conflicts in modern history. During the Second Congo War, Libya supported the Democratic Republic of the Congo by providing planes that transported soldiers from Chad to the region.  2011 Libyan civil war  For the 2011 conflict see 2011 Libyan civil war  References  ","title":"Military history of Libya"},{"id":"10743568","text":"Mistaken Identity is the debut solo album of American guitarist and Living Colour-member Vernon Reid, released in June 1996 on Sony Music-imprint label 550 Music.

He studied medicine at the University of Dorpat, graduating in 1902. Later, he continued his education with studies in anatomy and histology in the laboratory of histology at Munich (1903) and at St. Petersburg as an assistant of Peter Lesgaft (1837–1909). From 1906 to 1912 he worked in Dorpat as a prosector-assistant in the anatomical institute directed by August Rauber (1841-1917). In 1913, he moved to the University of Bern as an associate professor, shortly afterwards relocating to Paris, where he conducted neurological research under the directorship of Joseph Jules Dejerine (1849-1917). In 1918 he returned to Bern, where he spent several years working in the institute of anatomy. In 1923 Landau founded the department of histology and embryology at Kaunas University. Here he served as departmental head until 1932, afterwards relocating to the University of Lausanne, where he conducted investigations in the fields of brain anatomy, neurology and neurohistology.

Gert Postel went to Hauptschule and finished his training as a mail carrier. Postel himself said that his mother died because of a maladministered depression treatment and that he himself had briefly been in a juvenile ward. From these events, he claimed to have gained the motivation to expose and embarrass psychiatry. Career as impostor Public health office in Flensburg (2014) =Public health officer in Flensburg= In September 1982, Postel successfully applied for the position of assistant public health officer in Flensburg using the pseudonym of \\"Dr. med. Dr. phil. Clemens Bartholdy\\". When asked about his dissertation's subject, he reportedly replied \\"On Pseudologia phantastica [with regard to] the example of the character Felix Krull from the homonymous novel by Thomas Mann and cognitively induced distortions in stereotypical judgment\\".https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/petra-hinz-hochstapler- gert-postel-spricht-ueber-die-lebenslaufluege-der- bundestagsabgeordneten_id_5747460.html Due to coincidence, his true identity was discovered in April 1983 and Postel had to leave his position in public service. In 1984, he received a suspended sentence and was placed on probation for multiple instances of forgery of documents, unauthorized assumption of academic titles and forgery of health certificates. Also during the eighties, by his own account, he lived seven years in a partnership with a judge. Other employments as a medical doctor followed, e.g. in a private clinic and as a surgeon major with the Bundeswehr. =Senior physician at Zschadraß forensic psychiatry= After studying theology for a while, Postel managed to return to medical service in 1995. Using his birth name, he obtained the position of a senior physician in a clinic specialized on neurology and psychiatry in Zschadraß near Leipzig. As a part of his job, he issued psychiatric expertises and held lectures for medical doctors without raising suspicion with anyone. By chance, a co-worker recognised him on July 10, 1997, forcing him to go into hiding. At that time, an appointment was already set for an interview with Hans Geisler, then Saxony's Minister of State for social affairs, health and family, on the occasion of Postel's appointment to a professorship and to the position of chief of medicine at Saxony's hospital for psychiatry and neurology at Arnsdorf near Dresden. =Imprisonment= Gert Postel was arrested on May 12, 1998. In 1999, the state court in Leipzig sentenced him to four years in jail for repeated imposture and forgery of documents. Following his probationary release in January 2001, Postel published an account of his experiences, titled \\"Doktorspiele\\" (Playing Doctor). Intended to be an exposure of psychiatric establishment, the book made him an idol within the anti-psychiatry movement in Germany. = The irresistible = In 2002, ARD broadcast an NDR-produced docudrama titled \\"Der Unwiderstehliche – Die 1000 Lügen des Gert Postel\\" (\\"The Irresistible One - The Thousand Lies of Gert Postel\\"), directed by Kai Christiansen. The film features both re-enacted scenes and footage from an interview with Postel. In contrast to the broadly sympathising stance towards Postel in the German media —who drew comparisons with the \\"Captain of Köpenick\\", Wilhelm Voigt— the film takes a far more critical approach, including themes like narcissism. It also makes mention of Postel's alleged stalking of several women, including a prosecutor investigating his case, and intimidation of a patient in Zschadraß, whom according to her own account Postel had threatened with transferral to a locked ward, for challenging his method of treatment. = See also = *Uwe BarschelPostel had been suspected of some involvement in the affair.

Homestar Runner Homestar Runner as seen in his character video. Homestar Runner is the namesake character of the series, and \\"is a terrific athlete\\" that \\"everybody loves the\\". He serves as the star athlete of an unspecified sports team led by Coach Z, and has partaken in rather rigorous exercise routines. Homestar, however, has suffered from psychological issues that Strong Bad had described as an \\"unbelievably loose grasp on the world around [him]\\", often forgetting things or interacting with himself as if he were a different person. Homestar is not stupid, as he has shown intelligence at rather irrelevant times, such as correctly stating Coulomb's law in response to being asked what 2+2 equals. His best friend is Pom Pom, although Homestar has also had an on and off relationship with lone female character Marzipan. Homestar speaks with a moderately severe rhotacism, and also sounds as though he experiences chronic nasal congestion. Strong Bad Strong Bad is the middle child of the three Strong brothers, the others being Strong Sad and Strong Mad. He typically wears a red lucha libre mask, black pants and his boxing gloves (with which he can type), but no shirt. Strong Bad is almost always accompanied by his pet/sidekick, The Cheat, often while playing pranks on other characters in the series. He often insults his younger brother, Strong Sad, and answers emails sent to him by his fans. Strong Mad Strong Mad is an enormous, hyper-muscular, semi-verbal, usually-angry character (much like the Hulk). He is the eldest brother of the brothers Strong; his siblings are Strong Bad and Strong Sad. He often hangs out with The Cheat and helps Strong Bad commit mischief, harass, and occasionally beat up the other characters. He is also the bassist to Marzipan's music group Cool Tapes. However, he appears to at least try to be friendly to other characters when not told to harm them by Strong Bad. He has also proved to possess a sort of childlike innocence, which he has demonstrated by making macaroni pictures and, once, asking if he could keep Bubs' Concession Stand, claiming it followed him home. His body is a rectangle with different dimensions given in different cartoons, with perfectly square shoulders and no distinct head or neck. He has two dots for eyes and giant, bushy eyebrows that are usually angry. His mouth is always partially open revealing three teeth. He wears a purple wrestler's singlet with a white circle in the front containing a large red M and has red shoes. He generally speaks in short, simple sentences, often in an unrestrained roar. His best friend is The Cheat, whom he protects with fervor. He also has a horrible painting in his closet that gives everyone The Jibblies, called the Rocoulm. Strong Sad Strong Sad is the younger brother of Strong Bad and Strong Mad. He stands somewhere between Strong Bad and Strong Mad in height, and has large, elephant-like feet he calls \\"soolnds,\\" which has led Strong Bad to believe he is in some way descended from elephants. His body is round and two shades of gray--a lighter gray from the waist up, a darker gray from the waist down. His head is white and has an odd lump on the top (which Strong Bad refers to as a \\"disturbing soft serve flip.\\"), and resembles the Manicouagan Reservoir. He is usually very calm and soft-spoken, although is hyperactive when given caffeine. He is constantly tortured by Strong Bad, who frequently threatens to beat him up (and often does). Strong Bad also calls Strong Sad names such as \\"Dairy Queen\\", \\"The Ghost of Christmas Suck\\", \\"Trundle Bed\\", \\"Diaper Stripe\\", and \\"Theloneus Dump\\". In early cartoons, Strong Sad's main defining characteristic is his chronic depression, but has since been known to have high levels of intelligence and creativity. His many interests include listening, books, listening to books, calligraphy, being alone, arts and crafts. Strong Sad also enjoys playing board games, and he seems to enjoy going to science-fiction and fantasy conventions. His isolation has led him to explore his creativity, which is evident in his description of his fictional folk hero Saddy Dumpington.A Folky Tale by Homestar Runner at The Homestar Runner Official YouTube channel The Cheat The Cheat is Strong Bad's sidekick and Strong Mad's best friend. He stands at knee-height to most other characters and is covered with yellow fur with prominent black spots down his back. His arms resemble flippers and he does not have any visible legs. He also has a gold tooth. It is not known what type of \\"animal\\" The Cheat is; he seems to belong to his own species. Whenever Strong Bad is abusive to The Cheat, Strong Mad stands up for him. The Cheat lives in The King of Town's grill, which, according to Strong Sad, is a nice place. He can play multiple instruments, such as the flute, drums, and keyboard, and often makes unusual animations that he calls \\"Powered by The Cheat\\". In the original book, he helped Strong Bad cheat in the Strongest Man in the World contest, which gave him his name. He is always referred to as The Cheat, not just Cheat, even when being spoken to. The practice even extends to his species. He speaks in a language consisting entirely of high-pitched squeaks and growls, which the other characters seem to be perfectly able to understand. Subtitles are used whenever The Cheat talks to the camera alone. He often has a hostile attitude towards others, threatening to throw things at them. He often sounds rather full of himself, complimenting himself several times in the majority of his videos. The Cheat, according to Strong Bad, came from a giant egg also filled with a lifetime supply of fish sticks which he won on the same day that he met Homestar Runner in a 10-step foot race to win the egg, although it is unknown if this is actually true. Marzipan Marzipan is the only major female character in Homestar Runner. She has a handbell-shaped body with her face on the surface of the \\"handle\\". Her eyes consist of two black circles of different sizes. Her mouth is usually seen in a slight curve. She wears her hair in a bright yellow-like golden blonde haired ponytail, and is almost always seen wearing a purple dress embellished with white trim and gold buttons, along with a matching hair band. Like Homestar Runner, she does not appear to have visible arms. Nevertheless, she is still able to pick up and handle objects without any hint of difficulty. She is voiced by Missy Palmer and is one of the few characters not voiced by Matt Chapman. The reason she is the only female character is because Missy Palmer cannot do any other voices. Marzipan is Homestar's on-again, off-again girlfriend, frequently breaking up with him due to his insensitive behavior and obliviousness to her needs before later getting back together with him. In the early days of the website she was listed as the King of Town's daughter; however, in an interview, The Brothers Chaps remarked that this was an idea they had that they did not go through with. She is essentially a feminist \\"hippie chick\\", demonstrated in her traits of being vegan who spends much of her time singing and playing her guitar; she is lead singer and guitarist in a band called Cool Tapes. Most of her songs are about happiness and nature. She often makes protest signs to express her views on issues of varying and personal interest. She often tends to fight for political correctness and being eco-friendly, but at times can be hypocritical. Like Strong Bad, she has her own segment called Marzipan's Answering Machine, where the other characters leave messages (such as prank calls) on her answering machine. Bubs Bubs is a businessman who owns Bubs' Concession Stand, which offers a constantly changing variety of goods and services. He has a round blue head and mismatched eyes (his right eye is white with a blue iris while his left is simply a black dot). His upper body is orange, and he has \\"flipper arms.\\" He has a green stripe around his middle which, according to Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, is a belt, and his lower half is colored dark gray. His voice is reminiscent of Redd Foxx from Sanford and Son or Rochester of The Jack Benny Show fame. Always ready to make a quick buck, Bubs will sell anything, including letters off the sign on his stand. Besides the Concession Stand, he seems to run a few other businesses on the side, many of which are decidedly shady in nature. This includes performing almost any service that someone wants done, such as being a \\"questionable doctor\\" or a \\"paranormal investigator.\\" It is implied that he is often involved in destroying and/or covering up evidence of crimes. He also sells bologna sandwiches from his truck to the other residents of Free Country, USA. His best friend appears to be Coach Z, although the coach often gets on his nerves. He has an alter ego of \\"the Thnikkaman\\", though nobody (with the occasional exception of Homestar) knows that the Thnikkaman is just Bubs in sunglasses with a piece of paper taped to his chest that says \\"tH\\". Coach Z Coach Z is the eccentric \\"coach\\" of the residents of Free Country, USA, though it is unclear exactly what he coaches. He has a strong Upper Midwestern accent, which sometimes gets him into trouble and is thought to be fake, and frequently mispronounces words to increasingly ludicrous degrees. He almost never says anything negative to anyone, and he often offers more encouragement than is needed. He wears a blue and purple baseball cap and a large gold \\"Z\\" emblem around his waist, but it is unclear whether his bright green color is his skin or a body suit. Coach Z also seems to have mental and gender confusion problems, as evidenced by his time spent \\"talking to his parents\\" on a disconnected telephone, and claiming to be a mother. He has even stated on one occasion that he sometimes \\"forgets what's real, and what's just in [his] head\\". He also has trouble managing his money, causing his electricity to be shut off one year. He is quite lonely and has an unrequited crush on Marzipan, very often making inappropriate romantic gestures to her, especially on her answering machines. He is very fond of hip-hop and often refers to it in conversation. He is also an aspiring rapper, recording several songs, including \\"These Peoples Try to Fade Me\\", \\"Hip-Hop Dance\\", \\"Rap Song\\", and \\"Fish Eye Lens (ft. Strong Bad)\\". Pom Pom Pom Pom is a Pom from the Isle of Pom. Pom Pom, like all Poms, appears to be inflated. His body consists of a yellow sphere with an orange stripe. His oval head, triangular arms and feet are the same color orange. Pom Pom's eyes are black ovals and he has no visible mouth. He talks by making bubbly noises that only the characters can understand and can absorb objects into his body for storage. Along with Marzipan and The Poopsmith, Pom Pom is the only main character not voiced by Matt Chapman; his 'voice' is a recycled sound clip of Mike Chapman blowing bubbles in milk. Pom Pom is Homestar Runner's best friend, but he sometimes hangs out with Strong Bad as well. It has been hinted that Pom Pom is a superb athlete, martial artist, and rich to boot. His nationality has been vaguely hinted at a variety of times: his parents are known as General and Fräulein Pom Pom. His father owns a film production company which allows Pom Pom to direct indie films. He appears in the game Dangeresque Roomisode 1: Behind the Dangerdesque, as a take-out guy. He makes a cameo in the beginning cutscene of Poker Night at the Inventory as he leaves a previous poker game before you arrive. The King of Town The King of Town is the self-proclaimed ruler of Free Country, USA. His head is completely white, with black lines for eyes, a mustache and a beard (though it has been suggested that the white is fur or hair, as he has pink flesh underneath). He wears a gold crown and what appears to be a red robe with white trim with no arms. He is a known glutton that will eat almost anything in front of him (including toilet paper and other inedible items) and anything with the word \\"butter\\" in its name. Apparently, the only foods he doesn't like are those which contain peas. He tends to speak with an older but jolly tone of voice, usually saying \\"doo hoo hoo hoo\\" to represent his hearty laughter. He apparently got overweight by eating the lifetime supply of fishsticks that was in the egg that contained The Cheat. The Poopsmith The Poopsmith is a character whose job is the King of Town's \\"poopsmith,\\" though it is never explained what this actually entails. His body is peach-colored and egg-shaped, and he has small blue legs and feet, a white head, and an enormous underbite. He always wears a pair of large orange gloves stained with \\"whatsit,\\" which has been implied to be feces, and he is usually seen carrying a large shovel used to dig through a pile of whatsit outside the King's castle. The Poopsmith has taken a vow of silence and therefore almost never speaks. He does occasionally hold up signs to communicate, however, and is sometimes seen poking his shovel as a half-gesture. However, in \\"email thunder\\", the 200th Strong Bad Email, he breaks his vow to sing the opening song, and speaks again later when calling Marzipan. In these instances, he is voiced by John Linnell of They Might Be Giants. He does not seem to ever display any emotions or facial expressions. Homsar Homsar is an enigmatic dwarf with red shoes, blue shirt and a bowler hat. Homsar's speech consists almost entirely of non sequiturs, seen when he claims to be the captain of the \\"Gravy Train\\" and a \\"song from the sixties,\\" more often than not prefaced by a bizarre \\"ah-ahh-ahh!\\" uttering, although it is revealed in Strong Badia the Free that Homsar is actually an intelligent being, with his way of speaking being a language of his own. Strong Bad claims that Homsar's parents are a cup of coffee and a Chipwich, although the former was not confirmed by Homsar himself. He seems to have the super power of being incredibly awkward, and often defies the laws of physics. In most of his appearances, his hat will either change shape to something, or move around on its own, often orbiting his head. He was created when a fan accidentally misspelled Homestar Runner's name in the second Strong Bad Email, \\"homsar\\". Senor Cardgage Senor Cardgage is a character who looks like a taller Strong Bad with a protruding gut, goatee, glasses, and a comb-over. He first appeared in the Strong Bad Email \\"kind of cool\\" when Strong Bad was asked if he wasn't the \\"stylish, buff, handsome man in a wrestling mask\\" that he is. He usually speaks in a way that is \\"almost one word and not quite another.\\" He is not one of the twelve main characters, and as such, he does not have his own character video, though Strong Bad attempts to make one in the email \\"too cool\\".

Additionally, the Solanco High School administration was required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education to develop a School Improvement Plan to address the high school's low student achievement. Under the Pennsylvania Accountability System, the school must pay for additional tutoring for struggling students. The school is eligible for special extra funding through school improvement grants, which it must apply for each year. Graduation rate In 2012, Solanco High School's graduation rate was 87%.

The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012 Elizabethtown College offers the program in Lancaster County. College remediation rate According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 37% of Solanco High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and/or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment The high school offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses at local higher education institutions to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Solanco partners with Millersville University, Harrisburg Area Community College, Lancaster Bible College, Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology and Pennsylvania State University. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, state-funded Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to or apply to their institutions. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students from the Commonwealth due to a state budget crisis. For the 2009-10 funding year, Solanco School District received a state grant of $2,568 for the program. Graduation requirements Among Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts, graduation requirements widely vary. Solanco School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 26 credits to graduate, including: math - 3 credits, English - 4 credits, social studies - 3 credits, science - 3 credits, Arts and Humanities - 2 credits Physical Education (Fitness 1.5 credits and Wellness 0.5 credits) and 8 electives. An additional credit in English, math, science or social studies at the student's choice is required. Students must earn 6 credits to advance to 10th grade. They must earn 12 credits to advance to 11th grade. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students are required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Solanco students may take one of several courses to meet the requirement. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, a civics and government exam will be added.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Literature exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 - 38% on grade level, Biology - 35% on grade level, and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, science, history, and math), and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers' use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Solanco School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08 Solanco High School received $427,158. The school received $77,938 in 2008-09 for a total of $505,096 in funding. In Lancaster County the highest award was given to Lancaster School District - $1,193,377. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future grant funding was curtailed by Governor Rendell. Extracurriculars Solanco School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and is in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania interscholastic Athletics Association (PIAA). The school is a member of the Lancaster-Lebanon 2 Sports League. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, or charter school, and those who are homeschooled, are eligible to participate in extracurricular programs, including all athletics.

It is located on a hill facing the Mediterranean Sea at 500 m elevation. It is one of the oldest villages in Lebanon. In the Middle Ages, the Maronites took it as a refuge from their enemy's attacks.  Geography  * North Lebanon Governorate * Batroun District * Elevation: 500m * Distance from Beirut: 53 km * Distance from Tripoli:43 km * Distance from Batroun:10 km  Etymology and names  Smar could be of Aramaic origin: Shemreho ܫܡܪܚܐ which means the guardian or the protector;Moubarac, Y. (1984), Pentalogie Antiochienne / Domaine Maronite, Volume 2, Part 2, éditions Cénacle Libanais, Beirut. – page 722 Jbeil means Byblos, being the nearby coastal famous city. Given its strategic location on an open hillside, the village and its fort could have served as an advanced position for the defense of Jbeil from its northern side. Others refer the name to the Phoenician roots: Sym meaning Tomb'and Mar meaning lord. In this case, the village could have served as a burial ground for the kings of Jbeil (which is the oldest Phoenician city located at 20 km at the southwest of Smar Jbeil).  History  Smar Jbeil is one of the oldest villages in Lebanon according to Fr. Henri Lammens in his book Tasrih Al Absar fi Ma Yahtawi Loubnan min al Athar.Lammens, H. (1982). Tasrīḥ al-abṣār fī mā yaḥtawī Lubnān min al-āthār. Lubnān: Dār al-Rāʼid al-Lubnānī. – pages 91, 106 and 123–125 It has a very old castle at the western entrance of the village built on a strategic hill, showing from its western side, the Mediterranean coast from Byblos to Tripoli, and from its eastern side the mountains of Lebanon specially the famous Cedars of God mountain near Bsharri. The origin of the castle could be Phoenician. =The Romans= The Roman troops conquered the village from its northern side under the leadership of Pompey the Great, probably during his Eastern campaign in 63 BC.Moubarac, Y. (1984), Pentalogie Antiochienne / Domaine Maronite, Volume 2, Part 2, éditions Cénacle Libanais, Beirut. – page 722 Up till today, we can see some Roman statues in the castle as well as a Roman theater with its circular architecture. =The Maronites= The Maronites and their army (the Maradites), came to Smar Jbeil as a refuge place after centuries of persecution by Byzantines in Syria. They took control of the castle where they installed their Patriarch. The first Patriarch Saint John Maron (685 A.C.) lived in Smar Jbeil castle before moving to Kfarhay. =The Arabs and Crusades= The Arabs invaded the village after the crushing of the Byzantine Empire in the 9th century and controlled the village until the crusaders attacked them from the Mediterranean Sea. The crusaders demolished the old castle and built a new one called “Chateau Fort” (Strong Castle) because of its strategic location. They built a new Church on the south eastern side of the castle. In addition, they remodeled the old church of Saint Nohra (From Aramaic Nuhro meaning the light), which was itself built on the ruins of an old Roman temple. They added some Roman style construction to the church. The church still have a Crusader Cross on its western entrance. After the Crusades, the village entered under the Mamluks rule in the 13th century. =The Mamluks and the Ottomans= The Mamluks were defeated in 1516 AC by the Ottomans. The Ottomans under the Sultan Selim I invaded the region and built a mosque on the eastern side of the castle. The village recovered its Maronite identity in the next century and the mosque was turned into a residence place.  The Castle  The Castle was built in the center of the village, on a hill showing the entire neighborhood. Most of the historians recognize that the castle was built by the Phoenicians, and was under the Persian Empire control in 555 B.C. It passed to the hands of Alexander of Macedon's (the Great) in 331 B.C. In the Middle Ages, the Maronites and their army the Maradaites took the castle as a refuge and it was the See of the First Maronite Catholic Patriarch Saint John Maron before he moved to Kfarhay. The Mardaites counterattacked their enemies from Smar Jbeil and they won the battle in Amyoun (30 km north) while defending their Patriarch. The Castle had a main tower showing the entire Mediterranean coast from Jounieh to Tripoli. In his book Tarikh Al Azminah, the Patriarch Estephan El Douaihy (1670–1704) explains how the main castle tower was demolished: > Sunday, November 25th 1630, at 3:00AM a huge earthquake hit the castle and > demolished the center tower from its four corners. It demolished also all > what was in the lower basement.El Douaihy, Patriarch Estephan, Tarikh Al > Azminah, in the version of the Abbot Boutros Fahd, editions Dar Lahd Khater, > Beirut – 3rd Edition. – page 497 The castle has many wells built in the rocks. It has also many tunnels connecting the castle to the neighboring valleys.  Churches  The old church of Saint Bassil and Nohra stands in the center of the village. It is constructed of mixed elements from a Roman temple and some later material, notably from medieval times. The church was renovated over the history first by the Crusades and after by the Maronites. The last renovation was done in the late 1800 where a rock chain was added to the main entrance. Saint Nohra is a priest form Manhour in Egypt who came to preach in Batroun in the early centuries of Christianity. When he reached the city, he was asked by its king to deny Jesus Christ; he refused immediately and kept preaching in Jesus Christ in the entire city. He was captured (by the king), killed and buried in one of the castle's wells. The well became since then, a shrine for all Christian believers. Saint Nohra is known as the intercessor of sight, he had a named Takla (different from Saint Takla) and a brother named Qanoon. Close to Saint Nohra, an old little ruined chapel with a single nave could be seen, Our Lady of Gifts church. It is believed that this church is older than Saint Nohra's church. Less than 500m from Saint Bassil and Nohra church you find Saint Takla church which is smaller yet very old church venerated by the parish until our days. .Moubarac, Y. (1984), Pentalogie Antiochienne / Domaine Maronite, Volume 2, Part 2, éditions Cénacle Libanais, Beirut. – page 722  Patriarchs  Smar Jbeil is the homeland of three Maronite Patriarchs Michael Rizzi (1567–1581), Sarkis Rizzi (1581–1596) and Joseph Rizzi (1596–1608). They were born in Bkoufa and they were known as Al-Samrani's in relation to Smar Jbeil, their homeland and origins. Under Patriarch Michael Rizzi, the monastery of Saint Anthony the Great in Qozhaya (From Aramaic: the living Treasure) knew a revival, and later in 1610 the same monastery received the first printing press in the Middle East printing in Aramaic language.  Families  Smar Jbeil is known to be the origin of the Bassil family. Most of the families in the village are related somehow to the Bassil family it represents 85 to 90% of the residents. The Jemayel family came to Smar Jbeil in the 1880s from Bekfaya, after the Mount Lebanon tragic events at that time. The Fares family came to Smar Jbeil in the 1930s from Ram.

PDPC 1 is an enzyme which serves to reverse the effects of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase upon pyruvate dehydrogenase.  Function  Pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) is one of the three components (E1, E2, and E3) of the large pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases catalyze phosphorylation of serine residues of E1 to inactivate the E1 component and inhibit the complex. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases catalyze the dephosphorylation and activation of the E1 component to reverse the effects of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase is a heterodimer consisting of catalytic and regulatory subunits. Two catalytic subunits have been reported; one is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and another one is much more abundant in the liver. The catalytic subunit, encoded by this gene, is the former, and belongs to the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) superfamily. Along with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, this enzyme is located in the mitochondrial matrix.  Regulation  Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase is stimulated by insulin, PEP, and AMP, but competitively inhibited by ATP, NADH, and Acetyl-CoA.

Biography Heisey was born in Hanover, Germany, and emigrated with his family to the United States as an infant in 1843. The family settled in Merrittown, Pennsylvania, where Heisey graduated from the Merrittown Academy. Following his father's death and his mother's return to Germany, Augustus lived with his sister. Upon graduation, he entered the printing business for a short time. He made a career change in 1861, becoming a clerk with the King Glass Company in Pittsburgh. However, the American Civil War interrupted his career, and he enlisted as a private in the Union Army in 1862. He served with Company C of the 155th Regiment of Pennsylvania Zouaves and fought in several battles, including the Battle of Gettysburg, where he was wounded during the defense of Little Round Top. He served in twenty-two different engagements and was cited for gallantry. In 1864, he was promoted to the rank of captain. He left the army the following year, having risen to the brevet rank of major. Following the war, Heisey resumed his career in the glass industry, becoming first a shipping clerk and later a salesman for Ripley & Company of Pittsburgh. He was regarded as one of the best salesmen in the industry. On May 11, 1870, in Pittsburgh, he married Susan N. Duncan, daughter of George Duncan, Sr., who soon became the sole owner of the Ripley Glass Company and renamed it Geo. Duncan & Sons. Heisey later became part owner and general manager of the Duncan Glass Company, along with his wife and brother-in-law. In 1895, after several years away from the glass industry, Augustus Heisey moved to Newark, Ohio, and opened a glass factory there on the site of the old Penny Farm, commencing operations in 1896. During his time in Newark, Heisey rose to several other important positions in business and in the community. He was President of the Newark Trust Company, Vice President of the Ohio National Life Insurance Company, a founder and director of the Newark Heat and Light Company and a number of other important community business and social institutions. Augustus died February 13, 1922, at Atlantic City, New Jersey, and his sons E. Wilson and T. Clarence assumed control of the company. They ran the factory successfully until it ceased production following the Christmas holiday in 1957.

It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. The planner that originally laid out the town planned for it to become the county seat. Lincoln lies on U.S. Route 113 between Ellendale and Milford. The town was never incorporated, but streets were laid out and several businesses and residences came, surrounding the current Delmarva Central Railroad line. Lincoln was formerly the headquarters of the Delaware Coast Line Railroad. Recently there has been a push to incorporate Lincoln, primarily for two reasons. First, the city of Milford is quickly growing towards Lincoln and could eventually envelope the town. Secondly, the Delaware Department of Transportation is developing a Milford By-Pass for US 113 that could divide the small community of Lincoln, effectively cutting off neighbors from each other, as well as causing the removal of several homes and businesses and at least one of the two schools in Lincoln.  History  Early mention of the area include the Library of Congress which has record of a newspaper, The Lincoln Herald, published in the community beginning in October 1865 and the paper was later mentioned in The New York Times in the March 2, 1866 issue. The Evening Telegraph makes mention of a fundraising effort in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to erect a church in Lincoln in the May 29, 1869 issue.

History The Smith Island Light was constructed in 1858 using the classic New England design of a 1-1/2 story keeper's house with a light tower centered on the roof. Electric power was provided by a bank of 18 lead- acid truck batteries connected in series and recharged by gasoline-powered generators. The structure stood about from the island's western edge. The bluff began to erode, and when the bluff reached the front door in the 1950s, the lighthouse was abandoned. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The broken lighthouse could be seen clinging precariously to the bluff from the 1980s until the spring of 1998, when the last remains toppled into the sea. The lighthouse was replaced with an automated navigational light emanating on a focal plane from a skeletal tower constructed in 1957. The tower also houses a weather station operated by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Before erosion toppled it into the sea, maritime author Jim Gibbs obtained permission from the Coast Guard to retrieve the lantern room. The lantern room is now part of the privately owned Skunk Bay Memorial Lighthouse located on northern tip of the Kitsap Peninsula near Hansville.

At the time of the 2011 census, Hat Head had a population of 326 people. Straight Street is the main street and is below sea level; however it has been many years since any flood activity invaded the village. A flood gate has effectively halted any freshwater flowing along Korogoro Creek from its source at the Swan Pool wetland, to its mouth at Hat Head. As a result, the creek suffers increasingly from sedimentation and will benefit from periodic opening of the installed floodgates during small flood events. Part of the Kempsey Shire, Hat Head is a semi-isolated coastal location. It is predominantly a fishing village and tourist fishing resort. Approximately 350 permanent residents live on sand- based land mass surrounded by a national park and water — little, if any, land remains for new building — and property values are as much as fourfold higher compared to the balance of Kempsey Shire. It is a much sought-after location providing unique residential conditions. Hat Head has good community facilities such as a library with internet access as part of the Nicholl Community Centre, a tiny church, tennis courts, covered children's playground, and disabled access to a beach viewing platform.

In the Vance Integral Edition, it was retitled Clarges. Plot summary The city of Clarges in the future is a near-utopia, surrounded by barbarism throughout the rest of the world. Abundant resources and the absence of political conflict lead to a pleasant life that should be stress-free. However, nearly everyone is obsessed with a perpetual scramble for longer life, as measured by slope. Medical technology has led to a great lengthening of the human lifespan, but, in order to prevent the Malthusian horrors of overpopulation, it is awarded only to those citizens who have made notable contributions. Five categories have been created for those playing the life-extension game, the first four each offering an additional twenty years of life. One's progress can be shown as a graph, whose upward direction indicates a greater likelihood of achieving the next level. Therefore, the slope of one's \\"lifeline\\" is a measure of success. A person whose lifeline reaches the vertical terminator is not merely deprived of life-lengthening treatment, they are deliberately eliminated by government operatives, known as \\"Assassins\\". The ultimate prize is the top category, called Amaranth, which offers true immortality to the fortunate few. People who achieve this distinction are accorded the honorific \\"The\\" in front of their name. The Grayven Warlock was one of those few, but he has become a fugitive after a feud with another Amaranth resulted in the latter's death. Masquerading as his own \\"relict\\" (clone) using the name Gavin Waylock, he lives in obscurity, looking for the accomplishment that will reinstate him among the immortals. However, Waylock's dramatic stratagems result in changes to society far beyond anything he had intended. Reception Galaxy reviewer Floyd C.

He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. When Zerhusen was five, his family moved from New York to Germany where he learned to play soccer. He moved back to the U.S. in 1950 and settled in Cincinnati, Ohio. However, he was soon after drafted into the Army. After a period stationed in Germany, Zerhusen was transferred back to a base in Cincinnati. In 1954, he played for the Armed Forces soccer team in Cincinnati. At the time soccer was not a truly professional sport in the U.S. so when Zerhusen left the Army, he remained an amateur with the Cincinnati Kolping Soccer Club. In 1956, he was selected for the U.S. team which competed in the 1956 Summer Olympics. The Olympic tournament in 1956 was single game elimination and the U.S. lost 9–1 to Yugoslavia in the first game, Zerhusen scoring for the U.S. However, in preparation for the games, the U.S. had played several exhibition matches and Zerhusen scored seventeen goals in nine games leading up to the Olympics. While many sources show Zerhusen's national team career beginning in 1954, none of the U.S. games played during this year are counted by USSF or FIFA as full internationals. It wasn't until the April 7, 1957 6-0 thrashing at the hands of Mexico in a 1958 World Cup Qualifier that Zerhusen earned his first official cap with the U.S. national team. After losing all four qualifying games, two to Mexico and two to Canada, the next U.S. game was an 8–1 loss to England in 1959. However, that year saw greater success for the U.S. at the Pan American games. In the 1959 Pan American Games, the U.S. took the bronze behind ten goals by Zerhusen, including four goals in the game against Haiti. A month later the U.S. began qualifications for the 1960 Summer Olympics, but was quickly eliminated with a loss and a tie to Mexico. In 1960, Zerhusen scored his only goal in a full international when he tied Mexico 3–3 in a 1962 FIFA World Cup qualifier. However, Mexico won the game in Mexico and the U.S. had yet again failed to qualify for a major tournament. Zerhusen continued to play for the U.S. into 1965, earning a total of nine caps, but never again scoring. By this time, Zerhusen had established himself as one of the top amateur midfielders in the U.S. He was the captain of the Los Angeles Kickers for ten years. In both 1958 and 1964, the Kickers won the National Challenge Cup. The Kickers also made it to the 1960 National Cup finals, but fell to the Ukrainian Nationals that year. In 1961, Zerhusen was with the Los Angeles Scots who also fell to the Ukrainian Nationals in the title series. The Scots lost 7–4 on aggregate, with Zerhusen scoring all four of the Scots’ goals. Over his years with the Kickers and the Scots, Zerhusen was the Greater Los Angeles Soccer League's leading scorer 13 times. In 1978, Zerhusen was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame. He was the Director of the Los Angeles Soccer Club. He also coached several of the club's teams.

These reproduced sounds, named after sound-effects artist Jack Foley, can be anything from the swishing of clothing and footsteps to squeaky doors and breaking glass. Foley sounds are used to enhance the auditory experience of the movie. Foley can also be used to cover up unwanted sounds captured on the set of a movie during filming, such as overflying airplanes or passing traffic.Singer, Philip R. \\"Art Of Foley\\". Marblehead Publishing Co. Web. 1 July 2010. The term \\"Foley\\" also means a place, such as Foley-stage or Foley-studio, where the Foley process takes place. Foley artists recreate the realistic ambient sounds that the film portrays. The props and sets of a film often do not react the same way acoustically as their real life counterparts. The best Foley art is so well integrated into a film that it goes unnoticed by the audience. It helps to create a sense of reality within a scene. Without these crucial background noises, movies feel unnaturally quiet and uncomfortable. Hence, one function of Foley art is to eliminate the uncanny valley. History An early sound effects man (left) adding effects to a live radio play in the 1920s. He holds an effects board with which he can simulate ringing telephones and closing doors. What is now called Foley originated as adding sounds to live broadcasts of radio drama from radio studios around the world in the early 1920s. Phonograph recordings of the era were not of sufficient quality or flexibility to faithfully reproduce most sound effects on cue, so a sound effects person had to create all sounds for radio plays live. Jack Donovan FoleyConsidered, All Things. \\"Jack Foley: Feet to the Stars : NPR.\\" NPR : National Public Radio : News & Analysis, World, US, Music & Arts : NPR. Mar.-Apr. 2000. Web. 2 July 2010. started working with Universal Studios in 1914 during the silent movie era. When Warner studios released The Jazz Singer, its first film to include sound, Universal knew it needed to stay competitive and called for any employees who had radio experience to come forward. Foley became part of the sound crew that turned Universal's then- upcoming \\"silent\\" musical Show Boat into a musical. Because microphones of the time could not pick up more than dialogue, other sounds had to be added in after the film was shot. Foley and his small crew projected the film on a screen while recording a single track of audio that captured their live sound effects. Their timing had to be perfect, so that footsteps and closing doors synchronized with the actors' motions in the film. Jack Foley created sounds for films until his death in 1967. His basic methods are still used today. Modern Foley art has progressed as recording technology has progressed. Today, sounds do not have to be recorded live on a single track of audio. They can be captured separately on individual tracks and carefully synchronized with their visual counterpart.Bloom, Leslie. \\"YouTube – Leslie Bloome – Foley Artist.\\" YouTube – Broadcast Yourself. Nov.-Dec. 2009. Web. 1 July 2010. Foley studios employ hundreds of props and digital effects to recreate the ambient sounds of their films.  Uses  Foley complements or replaces sound recorded on set at the time of the filming, known as field recording. The soundscape of most films uses a combination of both. A Foley artist is the person who creates this sound art. Foley artists use creativity to make viewers believe that the sound effects are actually real. The viewers should not be able to realize that the sound was not actually part of the filming process itself. Foley sounds are added to the film in post production after the film has been shot. The need for replacing or enhancing sounds in a film production arises from the fact that, very often, the original sounds captured during shooting are obstructed by noise or are not convincing enough to underscore the visual effect or action. For example, fist-fighting scenes in an action movie are usually staged by the stunt actors and therefore do not have the actual sounds of blows landing. Props, sets, and costumes are often constructed of relatively cheap and lightweight materials that visually resemble but do not actually sound like more expensive materials. Crashes and explosions are often added or enhanced at the post-production stage. The desired effect is to add back to the original soundtrack the sounds that were excluded during recording. By excluding these sounds during field recording, and then adding them back into the soundtrack during post-production, the editors have complete control over how each noise sounds, its quality, and the relative volume. Foley effects add depth and realism to the audio quality for multimedia sources. Foley artists review the film as it runs to figure out what sounds they need to achieve the desired sound and results. Once they gather the material and prepare for use, they practice the sounds. When they accomplish the desired sound, they watch the film and add in the sound effects at the same time. This is similar to the way actors re-record dialogue, lip- syncing to the video or film image. Scenes where dialogue is replaced using dubbing also feature Foley sounds. Automatic dialogue replacement (ADR) is the process in which voice sounds are recorded in post production. This is done by a machine that runs the voice sounds with the film forward and backward to get the sound to run with the film. The objective of the ADR technique is to add sound effects into the film after filming, so the voice sounds are synchronized. Many sounds are not added at the time of filming, and microphones might not capture a sound the way the audience expects to hear it.Pramaggiore, Maria, and Tom Wallis. Film: A Critical Introduction. 2 ed. London: Laurence King Publishing Ltd., 2008. Print. The need for Foley rose dramatically when studios began to distribute films internationally, dubbed in other languages. As dialogue is replaced, all sound effects recorded at the time of the dialogue are lost as well. Creation Foley is created by the sound artist mimicking the actual sound source in a recording studio. Often there are many little sound effects that happen within any given scene of a movie. The process of recording them all can be time-consuming. Foley art can be broken down into three main categories — feet, moves, and specifics. =Feet= The category entails the sound of footsteps. To make the sound of walking down a staircase, Foley artists stomp their feet on a marble slab while watching the footage. Foley studios carry many different types of shoes and several different types of floors to create footstep sounds. These floors, known as Foley Pits, vary from marble squares to gravel and rock pits. Creating just the right sound of footsteps can greatly enhance the feel of a scene. Foley Artists are often referred to as \\"Foley Walkers\\" or \\"Steppers\\" when working in the \\"feet\\" subset of Foley. =Moves= The \\"moves\\" category makes up many of the more subtle sounds heard in films, for example, the swishing of clothing when two actors walk past each other. This sound is created by rubbing two pieces of the same material together near the microphone at the same rate that the actor’s legs cross. Cloth is not always used and tends to be recorded at the discretion of the dubbing mixer who ultimately controls the final outcome of the audio post-production process. =Specifics= Foley can also include other sounds, such as doors closing and doorbells ringing; however, these tend to be done more efficiently using stock sound effects, arranged by sound editors.

Wayne and Gloria divorced on August 31, 1960. In 1960, there is a record of Wayne marrying a Trudy Hancock.Personal information from Melody Lee Shanklin (Wayne Shanklin's granddaughter). He married his longtime secretary, Victoria Helen Hamway, on January 25, 1965. On August 31, 1965, his youngest boy of many children, Edward Windsor Shanklin, was born. Some sources state that Shanklin and Miss Toni Fisher were married at some point, but no record of the marriage is known to exist. Fisher's daughter, Chris Miller, later married Shanklin's son, Timothy Michael Shanklin. They had one known child. Wayne Shanklin died June 16, 1970, from a heart attack in Orange County, California. He was survived by his many children, wife Vicki, ex-wives and common-law wives. Music career In the early 1950s, Shanklin wrote with Al Sherman as well as Sherman's sons, Robert and Richard, who worked under pseudonyms at the time. Shanklin also contributed music to a number of films: \\"Kiss Me Quick\\" was featured in the 1957 Randolph Scott western Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend and \\"I Leaned On A Man\\" was sung by Virginia Mayo in The Big Land. Shanklin founded the independent record label Signet Records in Los Angeles in 1959. One of the label's early successes was a song written by Shanklin, \\"The Big Hurt\\", which became a #3 hit in early 1960 for Miss Toni Fisher, and is also claimed to be the first commercial use of the production phasing technique known as \\"flanging\\". Shanklin wrote several hit songs, including \\"Primrose Lane\\" (1959), recorded by Jerry Wallace, and \\"Jezebel\\", recorded by Frankie Laine in 1951. Shanklin's best-known composition is the song \\"Chanson D'Amour (Song of Love)\\".

Shanklin composed the original music for the 1961 film Angel Baby, starring George Hamilton and Mercedes McCambridge. Shanklin also wrote Miss Toni Fisher's 1962 single \\"West of the Wall\\", which dealt with the partition of East and West Germany and the erection of the Berlin Wall (although the same melody and arrangement were used previously for an obscure Fisher single on Signet called \\"Toot Toot Amore\\"). Covers \\"Chanson D'Amour (Song of Love)\\" was later covered by The Lettermen in the 1960s and was revived with great success by vocal jazz quartet The Manhattan Transfer in 1976. \\"Jezebel\\" was covered (as an instrumental) by Australian teenage guitar prodigy Rob E.G. in 1963, as well as by Herman's Hermits in 1967.

These products can typically be used on food, water, and hard surfaces, and are often designed for quick and easy home and commercial use. Categories Currently, there are two categories of food testing strips on the market. One type of food testing strip is an assay enzyme reactant test. This test requires the food testing strip to be dipped into a blended mixture of food or test samples, distilled water and a reagent. These strips are designed specifically to detect those strains of E.coli and Salmonella that are harmful to humans. A second type of food testing strip is a gram-negative swab, which is usually administered directly to the food itself. Gram-negative swabs generally work faster than enzyme reactant strips, but they differ in that the gram-negative swabs are designed to detect a broad group of organisms, not just those that can cause foodborne illness in humans.  Usage  The enzyme reactant test strips react when the buffer solution breaks the bacterial wall. This breach releases enzymes, which react upon contact to the enzyme test strips. The gram-negative reactant activates when components of the gram-negative cell wall or specific enzymes are present, causing the swab itself to change color. This is not directly indicative of the presence or absence of human pathogen in the test sample. People are now working on new ways to enhance these pathogen strips with silk pills and new nano-fiber technology.

Grant, and an advisor to Japan's Hokkaidō Development Commission. His collection of Japanese art and artifacts was sold to the Smithsonian Institution after his death. Early life Horace Capron was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts, the son of Seth Capron and his wife Eunice Mann Capron. His sister was Louisa Thiers (1814–1926), who in 1925 became the first verified person to reach age 111. His father, a doctor of medicine, opened woollen mills in New York State including Whitesboro, and from this experience Horace went on to supervise several cotton mills including Savage Mill in Savage, Maryland. He was also an officer in the Maryland Militia in the 1830s. In November 1834, Capron and others gathered suspects and potential witnesses of two recent Laurel railroad murders and brought them to Merrill's tavern. Some 300 railroad workers were questioned at the Baltimore county jail. In 1834, Horace married Louisa Victoria Snowden, whose late father Nicholas had owned Montpelier Mansion. This marriage brought lands and property. They had six children before Louisa died in 1849: Nicholas Snowden Capron, who died in infancy; Adeline Capron, who died at age 17 in Illinois; Horace Capron, Jr., who received the Medal of Honor after being killed in the Civil War; Albert Snowden Capron; Elizabeth Capron Mayo; and Osmond Tiffany Capron. Capron was involved in the mechanization of cotton mills beginning in 1835, having worked in mills from boyhood in Massachusetts and New York. In 1836 he was a major force in forming the Patuxent Manufacturing Company, which operated the Laurel Mill, a cotton mill on the Patuxent River, and with this effort he and associates started what became the town of Laurel Factory, later Laurel, Maryland. In 1851 the mill failed, and Capron declared bankruptcy. Soon after, he obtained an appointment from the President to assist in removal and resettlement of Native Americans from Texas following the Mexican–American War. He spent several months in Texas, and then moved to a farm near Hebron, Illinois where his mother Eunice and sister Louisa Thiers had settled and were taking care of his children. Here, he built an imposing mansion. In Illinois, he was remarried to Margaret Baker and took up farming in earnest, experimenting with farming improvements, writing articles, participating in events and receiving awards for his work. Military service In the American Civil War, Capron was called upon to establish and later lead the 14th Illinois Cavalry regiment. He was the oldest cavalry officer in the Union Army. Seeing action in a number of skirmishes and battles, ranging from Kentucky to Georgia, and losing his eldest son in battle, he left the army with an injury in 1864 and was later given the rank of Brevet Brigadier General dated to February 13, 1865. His earlier experiences led to an appointment in 1867 as a Commissioner in the Department of Agriculture for the United States Government. Japan Capron was asked by Kiyotaka Kuroda, a vice-chairman of the visiting the United States, to be a special advisor to the commission in Hokkaidō, Japan. Capron agreed and travelled to Hokkaidō 1870–71 as a foreign advisor. The Japanese government paid him $10,000 plus expenses to undertake this mission, which was a tremendous sum for the time. Capron needed the money, as his son Osmond had been blinded in a hotel fire, and now depended on Capron for support. Capron spent four years in Hokkaidō, suggesting numerous ways that the frontier island could be developed. He introduced large-scale farming with American methods and farming implements, imported seeds for western fruits, vegetables and crops, and introduced livestock, including his favorite Devon and Durham cattle. He established experimental farms, had the land surveyed for mineral deposits and farming opportunities, and recommended water, mill, and road improvements. His recommendation that wheat and rye be planted in Hokkaidō due to similarities in climate with parts of the United States also led to the establishment of Sapporo Beer, one of Japan's first breweries. He contributed to the urban planning for Sapporo city with an American-style grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks. Capron's tenure in Japan was not without controversy. Articles appeared in both Japan and the United States by former associates attacking his work and his personal competency. He was often frustrated with delays in the implementation of his suggestions, or on occasion the rejection of his suggestions by more conservative members of the government. However, Kuroda Kiyotaka, future Prime Minister of Japan, was a close and trusted friend. Capron admired the Ainu of Hokkaidō, whom he compared favorably to his experiences with Native Americans. From his journals, it appears that he also admired the Japanese, although he regarded them as semi-barbaric, and firmly believed that rapid adoption of Western culture would be in Japan's best interest. During his stay in Japan, Capron was honored with three audiences with Emperor Meiji, who took a close personal interest in his work in the development of Hokkaidō. In 1884, nine years after he departed Japan, Horace Capron was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (2nd class) for his services in transforming Hokkaidō. Final period After his time in Japan, Capron continued his contacts with the country, including acting as a purchasing agent for livestock and military equipment, and selling his house on N Street in Washington, D.C. to be the site of Japan's first Embassy. He was also engaged in writing his memoirs during this period. Capron attended the dedication of the Washington Monument on February 21, 1885. The extreme cold of the day, recorded at 12° Fahrenheit (−11° Celsius), was too much for the 80-year-old Horace Capron; he suffered a stroke, and died the following day. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.. During his period in Japan, Capron amassed a large collection of Japanese art and antiques. After his death, his widow Margaret sold the collection to the Smithsonian, where it became one of the foundations of the Smithsonian's Asian collection.

The song achieved prominence decades later when radio-show singer Ivar Haglund used it as the theme song for his Seattle, Washington radio show. Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie said that they taught the song to Haglund. Haglund went on to name the Seattle restaurant \\"Ivar's Acres of Clams\\" after the last line from the ballad.

Ashley, born in 1997, has severe developmental disabilities due to static encephalopathy; she is assumed to be at an infant level mentally, but continues to grow physically. The treatment included growth attenuation via high-dose estrogens, hysterectomy, bilateral breast bud removal, and appendectomy. In June 2016, after 18 years of searching, Ashley's condition was determined to be the result of a de novo (not inherited, i.e. a mutation) and non-mosaic Single-nucleotide polymorphism in the GRIN1 gene, which is implicated in neurotransmission. The principal purpose of the treatment was to improve Ashley's quality of life by limiting her growth in size, eliminating menstrual cramps and bleeding, and preventing discomfort from large breasts. The combination of the surgery and the estrogen therapy attracted much public comment and ethical analysis in early 2007, both supportive and condemning. Ashley's parents granted their first written interview to CNN Health in March 2008, and their second to The Guardian in March 2012. In addition, The Guardian published two interviews with mothers of a girl and a boy who had completed the treatment. A 2014 TV program and article tell the similar story of a girl in New Zealand. A survey on growth attenuation among pediatric endocrinologists was published in July 2015.  Background  Ashley was born with a severe brain impairment of genetic cause, termed a \\"static encephalopathy\\" because it does not improve. Although she sleeps and awakens, and breathes on her own, she is unable to raise her head, sit up, hold an object, walk, or talk, and must be tube-fed. Nonetheless, she is alert and responsive to her environment, particularly enjoying the music of Andrea Bocelli. Her parents have nicknamed Ashley \\"Pillow Angel\\", because she always remains where she is placed, which is usually on a pillow. In 2004 when Ashley was six and a half years old, she began to show signs of puberty and her parents and doctors began to anticipate a variety of issues common in children with severe neurological impairments. As these children grow larger, it takes more strength to move them and provide basic bodily care, raising the risk of pressure sores from immobility. Precocious puberty is common in children with various forms of severe brain damage. The early appearance of secondary sexual characteristics is often distressing to parents and caretakers. Many parents of severely disabled children explore possible ways to avoid having to deal with menstruation and fertility in a diapered child. A variety of treatments have been used over the last several decades to deal with these issues. In July 2004, Ashley had a hysterectomy (to prevent menstruation) and surgical removal of her nascent breast buds (to prevent development). She also underwent an appendectomy (because Ashley wouldn't be able to vocalize symptoms). The surgery was performed at Seattle's Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center. In addition, in December 2006 she completed estrogen therapy through dermal patches, which sped up the natural closure of her growth plates. Ashley's story first broke in October 2006, in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. In January 2007, her parents, who wish to remain anonymous, set up a blog to explain their reasoning for their decision and to share their story with families of other children who might benefit.  Arguments for the treatment  The parents state that they sought such treatment for the best interests of their daughter, namely, to enable them to personally continue constant care for her at home; to maximize her inclusion in family activities; to avoid the cramps and discomfort associated with menstruation; and to avoid the discomfort from large breasts (which runs in Ashley's family) while lying down or strapped in the chest area while in her wheelchair. Furthermore, they cited additional side benefits: to reduce the risk of bedsores; to prevent breast cancer and fibrocystic growth (both of which have occurred in her family); to prevent pregnancy; and to prevent appendicitis, which occurs in 5% of the population and which would be difficult to diagnose in Ashley as she would be unable to communicate the symptoms. They also believe that without secondary sexual characteristics, Ashley will be less vulnerable to sexual abuse by future caregivers when her parents will no longer be able to care for her. In an article published in June 2009 on Growth Attenuation, two pediatric endocrinologist and two bioethicists concluded as follows: The two bioethicists from the previous article also published an article in January 2010 cataloging and countering the criticisms that targeted the Ashley Treatment, and concluded as follows:  Results  After a year, Ashley's parents considered her treatment a success: She will never suffer from menstrual discomfort and cramps, she will always be flat chested and avoid breast related discomfort and other issues, and with her growth plates closed, she has reached her adult height of 53 inches (135 cm, or 4 ft 5 in) and weight of 63 pounds (29 kg), an estimated reduction of her potential height and weight of 20% and 40%, respectively.Burkholder, Amy Disabled girl's parents defend growth-stunting treatment, CNN, retrieved 2008-03-12  Reactions  In the United States, Arthur Caplan, of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics, has criticized the Ashley Treatment in an MSNBC editorial, arguing that it is \\"a pharmacological solution for a social failure--the fact that American society does not do what it should to help severely disabled children and their families.\\" Three renowned bioethicists spoke in support of the treatment and discussed different aspects of it in opinion statements presented by Scientific American. Disability rights advocates, including Not Dead Yet and Feminist Response in Disability Activism (FRIDA), called the treatment \\"invasive medical experimentation\\", \\"mutilation\\", \\"desexualization\\", and a violation of Ashley's human rights. FRIDA called on the American Medical Association to condemn the Ashley Treatment. The Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF) declared, \\"we hold as non-negotiable the principle that personal and physical autonomy of all people with disabilities be regarded as sacrosanct\\". Ashley's parents reported that 95% of the 5,000 emails they received were in support of the treatment, many of these testimonies and support emails are posted on Ashley's blog. The parents indicated that there was especially strong support among parents and caregivers of children with similar conditions to Ashley's, those who have the direct experience. They cite several ethicists in support of the treatment, including George Dvorsky, Peter Singer, Norm Fost, and Doug Diekema. In the United Kingdom, the British Medical Association stated, \\"If a similar case occurred in the UK, we believe it would go to court and whatever decision was ruled would be in the best interests of the child.\\" Dr. Peter Hindmarsh, Professor of Paediatric Endocrinology at Great Ormond Street Hospital was troubled by the treatment decision being taken by a hospital ethics committee. I am not sure the ethics committee was the right place to decide,' he said, adding that it was not clear who represented the child's interests when it went before the committee.\\" In Canada, ethicist Arthur Schafer's nationwide opinion piece defending the operation as justifiable considering Ashley's comfort engendered criticism from disability rights activists such as Dave Hingsburger of the York Central Hospital and Keenan Wellar from the LiveWorkPlay self-advocacy organization. In a rebuttal, Wellar attacked the notion that Ashley's limited mental abilities justified the decisions made on her behalf: \\"Infants have human rights even though they can't speak for themselves. Why should Ashley have received any less consideration?\\" On May 8, 2007, an investigative report done by Disability Rights Washington (formerly The Washington Protection and Advocacy System) in conjunction with The Utah Disability Law Center criticized the hospital that performed this controversial procedure for violating Washington State law, which is disagreed upon by the family's attorney.

It means that if legal redress or equitable relief to an injured party is available, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no remedy at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a speedy trial and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because of the unfairness for the injured party who sustained the injury having little hope for timely and effective remedy and resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for legal reformers who view courts, tribunals, judges, arbitrators, administrative law judges, commissions or governments as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the case is too complex, the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour. Individual cases may be affected by judicial hesitancy to make a decision. Statutes and court rules have tried to control the tendency; and judges may be subject to oversight and even discipline for persistent failures to decide matters timely, or accurately report their backlog. When a court takes a matter \\"under advisement\\" awaiting the issue of a judicial opinion, order or judgement and forestalls final adjudication of a lawsuit or resolution of a motion the issue of timeliness of the decision(s) comes into play.  Origin  There are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase. According to Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations, it is attributable to William Ewart Gladstone, but such attribution was not verifiable.Suzy Platt (ed.). Entry 954. William Ewart Gladstone (1809–98). Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations Requested from the Congressional Research Service. Library of Congress, 1989. (Attributed to William E. Gladstone. — Laurence J. Peter, Peter's Quotations, p. 276 (1977). Unverified.) Alternatively, it may be attributed to William Penn in the form \\"to delay Justice is Injustice\\".Penn, William (1693), Some Fruits of Solitude, Headley, 1905, p. 86. Mentions of justice delayed and denied are found in Pirkei Avot: \\"Our Rabbis taught: ...The sword comes into the world, because of justice delayed and justice denied...\\".PirkeiAvot 5:8 Nachmanides understands the advice given by Jethro in Exodus 18:22, to judge the people at all times, as suggesting that Israel needed more judges because potential litigants would otherwise suffer injustice due to their inability to find a judge to hear their case.10 Minutes of Torah. Ethical Teachings Selections from Pirkei Avot. Retrieved 26 March 2013 Magna Carta of 1215, clause 40 of which reads, \\"To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.\\" In 1617, upon being elevated to Lord Chancellor of England, Francis Bacon said that \\"Swift justice is the sweetest.\\" Martin Luther King, Jr., used the phrase in the form \\"justice too long delayed is justice denied\\" in his Letter from Birmingham Jail, smuggled out of prison in 1963, ascribing it to \\"one of our distinguished jurists\\". The broader public policy implications are a source of concern. As Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger noted in an address to the American Bar Association in 1970: > \\"A sense of confidence in the courts is essential to maintain the fabric of > ordered liberty for a free people and three things could destroy that > confidence and do incalculable damage to society: that people come to > believe that inefficiency and delay will drain even a just judgment of its > value; that people who have long been exploited in the smaller transactions > of daily life come to believe that courts cannot vindicate their legal > rights from fraud and over-reaching; that people come to believe the law – > in the larger sense – cannot fulfill its primary function to protect them > and their families in their homes, at their work, and on the public > streets.\\" Lack of a speedy and effective resolution (amidst a bewildering multiplicity of statutes and forums with overlapping jurisdiction) can cause unwarranted delay. It has been observed that it creates a sense of frustration and unfairness, and a feeling of a lack of efficacy, which adversely affects employee morale and labor relations in the federal sector. \\"Delays in the law are hateful\\" In diem vivere in lege sunt detestabilis is a Latin legal maxim. quoted in On the other hand, \\"No delay [in law] is long concerning the death of a man,\\" is another Latin lawyer's aphorism. And, \\"It is not to be imagined, that the King will be guilty of vexatious delays.\\" For participants in the justice system, the question of whether justice was denied is whether delay is avoidable or disproportionate, or unavoidable and necessary. Proportionality is integral to such interpretations. Time taken to resolve the dispute is critical. Alternative dispute resolution, case management systems, and trial and motion practice are all integral to such determinations.  Ethical principles  Prompt decision making is part of 'Judging 101', and is covered in every judicial handbook. \\"Judges should endeavour to perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved judgments, with reasonable promptness.\\" To a similar effect in Canada: \\"A judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly....\\"Canadian Judicial Council, Ethical Principles for Judges (1998), Chapter 4, article 3. Applicable to federal judges and effective March 12, 2019, the Code of Conduct for United States Judges elucidates \\"the ethical canons that apply to federal judges and provides guidance on their performance of official duties and engagement in a variety of outside activities.\\" Beyond general exhortations, it has little to say about delay in dispositions: > \\"Canon 3: A Judge Should Perform the Duties of the Office Fairly, > Impartially and Diligently > \\"The duties of judicial office take precedence over all other activities. > The judge should perform those duties with respect for others, and should > not engage in behavior that is harassing, abusive, prejudiced, or biased. > The judge should adhere to the following standards: > \\"(A) Adjudicative Responsibilities. > \\"(1) A judge should be faithful to, and maintain professional competence in, > the law and should not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or > fear of criticism. > \\"(2) A judge should hear and decide matters assigned, unless disqualified, > and should maintain order and decorum in all judicial proceedings. ... > \\"(5) A judge should dispose promptly of the business of the court.\\" As a commentator for the American Judicature Society noted: > \\"Unjustifiable delay in court proceedings, particularly in deciding cases, > can have a significant impact on the parties and reflects adversely on the > judicial system. Under Canon 3B(8)of the 1990 model code, a judge is > required to \\"dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently and > fairly.\\" Commentary to the 1990 model code reminds judges that \\"in disposing > of matters promptly, efficiently and fairly, a judge must demonstrate due > regard for the rights of the parties to be heard,\\" while a comment to the > 2007 model code cautions that \\"the duty to hear all proceedings with > patience and courtesy is not inconsistent with the duty imposed . . . to > dispose promptly of the business of the court. Judges can be efficient and > businesslike while being patient and deliberate.\\" > To ensure prompt and efficient disposition of cases, commentary to the code > advises judges to: * seek the necessary docket time, court staff, expertise, > and resources, * monitor and supervise cases, * devote adequate time to > judicial duties, * be punctual in attending court, * expeditiously decide > matters under submission, and * take reasonable measures to ensure that > court officials, litigants, and their lawyers cooperate to that end.\\" Speedy justice in the findings and within the confines of the case, facts and the law is a stated goal of many legal systems. Conversely, \\"[D]epriving quick and certain justice to the litigants ... reinforces the negative images of the judicial system....\\" A long list of potential excuses for extended decisional slow motion are disallowed. And in weighing the wrongfulness of the delay, there are a multiplicity of factors that may come into play.  Legislative prescriptions  Passed in 1990, the United States Code, Title 28, §476(a)(3) has a \\"novel process of making public the names of judges\\" who let cases go too long without decisions or judgment. Reports must be filed if motions and trials are in submission and have been pending more than six months without decision; and cases that have not been ended within three years of filing. See Civil Justice Reform Act, which tries to deal with lifetime tenured judges, judicial efficiency, judicial independence, separation of powers and legislative oversight. The Province of Quebec, Canada, has a flat statutory statement mandating six months as a requirement for ordinary civil actions. It states: 465. \\"A judgment on the merits must be rendered within six months after the case is taken under advisement, or within four months after the case is taken under advisement in a small claims matter.\\" In Canada, the six months has been treated as a mere aspirational guideline or suggestion. According to the Canadian Judicial Council, even when it took it seriously, the consequence were \\"a slap on the wrist.\\" In one misconduct claim, a Quebec judge had gone over the 6-month limit in five cases.Canadian Judicial Council, Annual Report 1992-93, page 14-15. When the Council proceed up the judge's chain of command, it was handled administratively. The chief judge complained, and ipso facto the judgments appeared. A simple warning was issued, and the judge retired. In Louisiana there exist overlapping statutes and court rules, which require that cases be decided within 30 days of submission. They require the filing iof a report, if that standard is exceeded. Untimely decisions and misstatements or failure to document cases may subject a judge to judicial discipline.La. R.S. 13:4207 and Supreme Court General Administrative Rules Part G, § 2 both relate to cases taken under advisement. In re Lee, 933 So. 2d 736 (Louisiana 2006)  Court rule fixes  In some states, court rules have been adopted requiring that delays in making decisions or completing cases must be reported. For example, in Michigan the so-called \\"910 Report\\" must be filed after a matter is under advisement for more than 90 days. It requires the judge to file a certified statement with the court administrator specifying the case, the matters taken under advisement, the reasons for the delay, and the estimated time of arrival for the cure to the problem. In Indiana, \\"Trial Rule 53.1 and Ind. Trial Rule 53.2 are officially titled \\"Failure to rule on motion\\" and \\"Time for holding issue under advisement; delay of entering a judgment but are commonly known as the 'lazy judge' rules.\\" Under those rules, the trial court has 90 days in which to render its decision; and that time can only be extended by order of the Indiana Supreme Court.  Practical application  A Canadian Barrister wrote that \\"Delay in rendering reasons for judgment is the #1 disease afflicting judges.\\" Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, John Owen Wilson,John Owen Wilson via Waymarking.com wrote about delay in the delivery of judgments that: > \\"The public has a right to expect of a judge decisiveness.... \\"Litigants > expect, and rightfully expect, that the judge will soon relieve them from > the agony of uncertainty that prevails until judgment is delivered. \\"That is > not to say that it is better to be quick than right.... The aim is to be > both quick and right.\\" quoted in Duhaim, 2013 Justice Wilson flatly stated: \\"[A] month's delay is normal. Two months delay is long. And three months is too long.\\" Efficiency in the making of judicial decisions and the avoidance of undue hesitancy while maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the decision making process implicates law and ethics. When faced with inordinate delay, a litigant and lawyer are placed between 'a rock and a hard place.' There is a concern about retaliation and provoking a shoot the messenger reaction. There is little if any remedy, and there is a risk that even an inquiry will provoke an adverse result. The Latin legal maxim Actus curiæ neminem gravabit, meaning that the act of the Court shall prejudice no one, becomes applicable when a situation is protected because the Court is under an obligation to undo the wrong done to a party by the Court's own act. Thus, the court's delay should not prejudice the rights of a party, it being a well settled principle. Subsequent events ought not to frustrate a well established cause of action. As was written by Justice William O. Douglas in Parker v Ellis dissenting opinion and citing Mitchell v. Overman, 103 U.S. 62, 26 L.Ed. 369, 103 U.S. at pages 64–6: > \\"But the principle is deep in our jurisprudence and was stated long ago in > Mitchell v. Overman ... \\"'(T)he rule established by the general concurrence > of the American and English courts is, that where the delay in rendering a > judgment or a decree arises from the act of the court, that is, where the > delay has been caused either for its convenience, or by the multiplicity or > press of business, either the intricacy of the questions involved, or of any > other cause not attributable to the laches of the parties, the judgment or > the decree may be entered retrospectively, as of a time when it should or > might have been entered up. In such cases, upon the maxim actus curiae > neminem gravabit, which has been well said to be founded in right and good > sense, and to afford a safe and certain guide for the administration of > justice,-it is the duty of the court to see that the parties shall not > suffer by the delay. A nunc pro tunc order should be granted or refused, as > justice may require in view of the circumstances of the particular case.' > \\"It is the fault of the courts, not Parker's fault, that final adjudication > in this case was delayed until after he had served his sentence. Justice > demands that he be given the relief he deserves. Since the custody > requirement, if any, was satisfied when we took jurisdiction of the case, I > would grant the relief as of that date.\\" This is no more than the application of the equitable principle, and well known aphorism, that \\"Not only must Justice be done; it must also be seen to be done\\",R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy ([1924] 1 KB 256, [1923] All ER Rep 233) which in turn is related to the equitable maxims, \\"Equity sees that as done what ought to be done\\" and \\"Equity abhors a forfeiture\\".  In literature  In Bleakhouse, Charles Dickens wrote about extraordinarily protracted proceedings in the Victorian English Court of Chancery. He used as illustrated \\"a synonym of delay\\" which yielded only disastrous consequences for the participants. The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes: > In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak > House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named Jarndyce and Jarndyce in > order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of > Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce > drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so > complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\\" (BH1 16). As a > consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and > Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\\" one goes insane and > another's mind is consumed with \\"corroding care, suspense, distrust, and > doubt\\" (BH 630).\\" In the preface to Bleak House, Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \\"friendly suit\\": Based on an 1853 letter of Dickens, the first of these cases has been identified as the dispute over the will of Charles Day, a boot blacking manufacturer who died in 1836. Proceedings were commenced in 1837 and not concluded until at least 1854. The second of these cases is generally identified as the dispute over the will of the \\"Acton Miser\\" William Jennens of Acton, Suffolk. Thus it had been ongoing for 55 years when Bleak House was published.  Other applications  Over the years, even the existence of a right to appeal in criminal and even civil appeals has been characterized by U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Josiah Brewer as an attack on justice and trial courts, and the ingraining of \\"justice delayed is justice denied\\". As he stated: \\"One thing should always be borne in mind. Whatever the sifting process of successive appeals may accomplish in ascertaining the exact truth, justice delayed is often justice denied. The early end of every litigation should be one of the great objects of all judicial proceedings.\\" The Chicago Evening Post countered that the right to an appeal is a surety of getting the right legal result, an no attack at all on the sanctity of trials. It says this is not a proper occasion to invoke the maxim. It urges that but for the championing of a United States Supreme Court Justice, the argument would be dead on arrival.truth In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Oregon's closing of courts including family courts that deal with immediate needs of distressed families has sparked protests and application of the sobriquet.

She has won numerous awards, including the Langston Hughes Medal and the NAACP Image Award. She has been nominated for a Grammy Award for her poetry album, The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection. Additionally, she has been named as one of Oprah Winfrey's 25 \\"Living Legends\\". Giovanni gained initial fame in the late 1960s as one of the foremost authors of the Black Arts Movement. Influenced by the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power Movement of the period, her early work provides a strong, militant African-American perspective, leading one writer to dub her the \\"Poet of the Black Revolution\\". During the 1970s, she began writing children's literature, and co-founded a publishing company, NikTom Ltd, to provide an outlet for other African- American women writers. Over subsequent decades, her works discussed social issues, human relationships, and hip hop. Poems such as \\"Knoxville, Tennessee\\" and \\"Nikki-Rosa\\" have been frequently re-published in anthologies and other collections.Margaret D. Binnicker, \\"Yolande Cornelia 'Nikki' Giovanni\\", Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Retrieved October 17, 2014. Giovanni has taught at Queens College, Rutgers, and Ohio State, and is currently a University Distinguished Professor at Virginia Tech. Following the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007, she delivered a chant-poem at a memorial for the shooting victims. Life and work Yolande Cornelia \\"Nikki\\" Giovanni Jr. was born in Knoxville, Tennessee,Poetry Foundation Center Nikki Giovanni Biography to Yolande Cornelia Sr. and Jones \\"Gus\\" Giovanni. Soon after her birth, the family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio where her parents worked at Glenview School. In 1948, the family moved to Wyoming, and sometime in those first three years, Giovanni's sister, Gary, began calling her \\"Nikki.\\" In 1958, Giovanni moved to Knoxville, TN to live with her grandparents and attend Austin High School. In 1960, she began her studies at her grandfather's alma mater, Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, as an \\"Early Entrant\\", which meant that she could enroll in college without having finished high school first.\\"Nikki Giovanni-The Real Deal\\", Dallas News. She immediately clashed with the Dean of Women, Ann Cheatam, and was expelled after neglecting to obtain the required permission from the Dean to leave campus and travel home for Thanksgiving break. Giovanni moved back to Knoxville, where she worked at a Walgreens drug store and helped care for her nephew, Christopher. In 1964, Giovanni spoke with the new Dean of Women at Fisk University, Blanche McConnell Cowan (\\"Jackie\\"), who urged her to return to Fisk that fall. While at Fisk, Giovanni edited a student literary journal (titled Èlan), reinstated the campus chapter of SNCC (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee), and published an essay in Negro Digest on gender questions in the Movement. In 1967, she graduated with honors with a B.A. degree in history. Soon after graduation, she suffered the loss of her grandmother, Louvenia Watson, and turned to writing to cope with her death. These poems would later be included in her collection Black Feelings, Black Talk. In 1968, Giovanni attended a semester at University of Pennsylvania and then moved to New York City. She briefly attended Columbia University and privately published Black Feeling, Black Talk. In 1969, Giovanni began teaching at Livingston College of Rutgers University. She was an active member of the Black Arts Movement beginning in the late 1960s. In 1969, she gave birth to Thomas Watson Giovanni, her only child. In 1970, she began making regular appearances on the television program Soul!, an entertainment/variety/talk show that promoted black art and culture and allowed political expression. Soul! hosted important guests such as Muhammad Ali, James Baldwin, Jesse Jackson, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Gladys Knight, Miriam Makeba, and Stevie Wonder. (In addition to being a \\"regular\\" on the show, Giovanni for several years helped design and produce episodes.) She published multiple poetry anthologies, children's books, and released spoken word albums from 1973 to 1987. Since 1987, she has taught writing and literature at Virginia Tech, where she is a University Distinguished Professor. She has received the NAACP Image Award several times, received 20 honorary doctorates and various other awards, including the Rosa Parks and the Langston Hughes Award for Distinguished Contributions to Arts and Letters. She also holds the key to several different cities, including Dallas, Miami, New York City, and Los Angeles.\\"Virginia Tech's Nikki Giovanni Nominated for Spoken Word GRAMMY\\", Virginia Tech News. She is a member of the Order of the Eastern Star (PHA), she has received the Life Membership and Scroll from the National Council of Negro Women, and is an Honorary Member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Giovanni c. 1980 Giovanni was diagnosed with lung cancer in the early 1990s and underwent numerous surgeries. Her book Blues: For All the Changes: New Poems, published in 1999, contains poems about nature and her battle with cancer. In 2002, Giovanni spoke in front of NASA about the need for African Americans to pursue space travel, and later published Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea: Poems and Not Quite Poems, which dealt with similar themes. She has also been honored for her life and career by the HistoryMakers, along with being the first person to receive the Rosa L. Parks Women of Courage Award. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor from Dillard University in 2010. In 2015, Giovanni was named one of the Library of Virginia's \\"Virginia Women in History\\" for her contributions to poetry, education, and society. Giovanni gave an extended interview to Bryan Knight's Tell A Friend Podcast where she gave an assessment of her life and legacy. =Virginia Tech shooting= Seung-Hui Cho, the mass murderer who killed 32 people in the Virginia Tech shooting on April 16, 2007, was a student in one of Giovanni's poetry classes. Describing him as \\"mean\\" and \\"menacing\\", she approached the department chair to have Cho taken out of her class, and said she was willing to resign rather than continue teaching him. After the massacre, Giovanni stated that, upon hearing of the shooting, she immediately suspected that Cho might be the shooter. Giovanni was asked by Virginia Tech president Charles Steger to give a convocation speech at the April 17 memorial service for the shooting victims (she was asked by Steger at 5:00 pm on the day of the shootings, giving her less than 24 hours to prepare the speech). She expressed that she usually feels very comfortable delivering speeches, but worried that her emotion would get the best of her. On April 17, 2007, at the Virginia Tech Convocation commemorating the April 16 massacre, Giovanni closed the ceremony with a chant poem, intoning: Her speech also sought to express the idea that really terrible things happen to good people: \\"I would call it, in terms of writing, in terms of poetry, it's a laundry list. Because all you're doing is: This is who we are, and this is what we think, and this is what we feel, and this is why - you know?... I just wanted to admit, you know, that we didn't deserve this, and nobody does. And so I wanted to link our tragedy, in every sense, you know - we're no different from anything else that has ....\\" She thought that ending with a thrice-repeated \\"We will prevail\\" would be anti-climactic, and she wanted to connect back with the beginning, for balance. So, shortly before going onstage, she added a closing: \\"We are Virginia Tech.\\" Her performance produced a sense of unity and received a fifty-four second standing ovation from the over-capacity audience in Cassell Coliseum, including then-President George W. Bush.Robin Bernstein, \\"Utopian Movements: Nikki Giovanni and the Convocation Following the Virginia Tech Massacre\\", African American Review 45.3 (2012): 341–353. Writing Giovanni in 2007 The Civil Rights Movement and Black Power movements inspired her early poetry that was collected in Black Feeling, Black Talk (1968), which sold over ten thousand copies in its first year, in Black Judgement (1968), selling six thousand copies in three months, and in Re: Creation (1970). All three of these early works aided in establishing Giovanni as a new voice for African Americans.(30) In \\"After Mecca\\": Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement, Cheryl Clarke cites Giovanni as a woman poet who became a significant part of the Civil Rights and Black Power Movement.Clarke, Cheryl, \\"After Mecca\\": Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement, New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2005. Giovanni is commonly praised as one of the best African-American poets emerging from the 1960s Black Power and Black Arts Movements.\\"Nikki Giovanni\\". Poetry Foundation. 2010. Her early poems that were collected in the late 1960s and early 1970s are seen as radical as and more militant than her later work. Her poetry is described as being \\"politically, spiritually, and socially aware\\". Evie Shockley describes Giovanni as \\"epitomizing the defiant, unapologetically political, unabashedly Afrocentric, BAM ethos\\". Shockley, Evie, Renegade Poetics: Black Aesthetics and Formal Innovation in African- American Poetry. Iowa City, IA: University of Iowa Press, 2011. Her work is described as conveying \\"urgency in expressing the need for Black awareness, unity, [and] solidarity.\\" Likewise, Giovanni’s early work has been considered to be “polemic,” and “incendiary.” Examples of poems in which she vehemently advocated for change include “The True Import of Present Dialogue Black vs. Negro” (1968), “Poem for Black Boys” (1968) and “A Litany for Peppe” (1970). Not only did Giovanni write about racial equality, but she also advocated for gender equality, as well. In fact, Odon states that “Giovanni’s realignment of female identity with sexuality is crucial to the burgeoning feminist movement within the black community.\\" In the poem, “Revolutionary Dreams” (1970), Giovanni discusses gender and objectification. She writes, “Woman doing what a woman/Does when she’s natural/I would have a revolution” (lines 14-16) Another example of a poem that encourages sexual equality is “Woman Poem” (1968). In “Woman Poem,” Giovanni shows that the Black Arts Movement and racial pride were not as liberating for women as they were for men (Virginia Fowler, Introduction to theCollected Works of Nikki Giovanni). In “Woman Poem,” Giovanni describes how pretty women become sex objects “and no love/or love and no sex if you’re fat/get back fat black woman be a mother/grandmother strong thing but not woman.” Giovanni is known for her use of vernacular language. Virginia Fowler in the introduction of The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni states, “Giovanni’s poetry draws our attention to the limitations and artificiality of language and of language shaped into what we call ‘art.’” Fowler quotes the poem, “My House,” in which Giovanni writes: \\"english isn’t a good language/to expression through/mostly i imagine because people/try to speak English instead/of trying to speak through it\\" (lines 30-34). One reason why Giovanni does not capitalize the word, “English,” could be because it is not used well for communication, unless people “speak through it.” Giovanni herself takes great pride in being a \\"Black American, a daughter, mother, and a Professor of English\\". (29) She has since written more than two dozen books, including volumes of poetry, illustrated children's books, and three collections of essays. Her work is said to speak to all ages, and she strives to make her work easily accessible and understood by both adults and children. (29) Her writing, heavily inspired by African-American activists and artists,\\"Nikki Giovanni - Spotlight - Interview\\", Ebony, December 2003.\\"Poet, Tupac capture beauty beneath pain\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (April 5, 1997). also reflects the influences of issues of race, gender, sexuality, and the African-American family. Her book Love Poems (1997) was written in memory of Tupac Shakur, and she has stated that she would \\"rather be with the thugs than the people who are complaining about them.\\" Additionally, in 2007 she wrote a children's picture book titled Rosa, which centers on the life of Civil Rights leader Rosa Parks. In addition to this book reaching number three on the New York Best Seller list, it also received the Caldecott Honors Award, and its illustrator, Brian Collier, received the Coretta Scott King Award. (29) Giovanni's poetry reaches more readership through her active engagement with live audiences. She gave her first public reading at the New York City jazz spot, Birdland. Her public expression of “oppression, anger, and solidarity” as well as her political activism allow her to reach more than just the poetic circles. After the birth of her son in 1969, Giovanni recorded several of her poems with a musical backdrop of jazz and gospel. She began to travel all around the world and speak and read to a wider audience. Even though Giovanni's earlier works were known to carry a militant, revolutionary tone, Giovanni communicated \\"a global sense of solidarity amongst oppressed peoples in the world\\" in her travels. It is in this sense of human unity in which Giovanni aligns herself with the beliefs of Martin Luther King, Jr. Like King, Giovanni believes a unified, collective government must be made up of the everyday, ordinary citizen, regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender. In the 1970s and '80s her popularity as a speaker increased even more. In 1972 Giovanni interviewed Muhammad Ali on Soul! Giovanni is often interviewed regarding themes pertaining to her poetry such as gender and race. In an interview entitled \\"I am Black, Female, Polite\\", Peter Bailey questions her regarding the role of gender and race in the poetry she writes.Bailey, Peter. \\"I am Black, Female, Polite\\". Nikki Giovanni and Virginia C. Fowler, Conversations with Nikki Giovanni, Jackson: University of Mississippi, 1992. 31–38. Bailey specifically addresses the critically acclaimed poem \\"Nikki-Rosa,\\" and questions whether it is reflective of the poet's own childhood and her experiences in her community. In the interview, Giovanni stresses that she did not like constantly reading the trope of the black family as a tragedy and that \\"Nikki-Rosa\\" demonstrates the experiences that she witnessed in her communities. For example, Giovanni writes about her happy childhood as: \\"Black love is Black wealth and they’ll/probably talk about my hard childhood/and never understand that/all the while I was quite happy\\" (lines 30-33) Specifically, the poem deals with black folk culture and touches on such gender, race, and social issues as alcoholism and domestic violence and not having an indoor bathroom. (30) Giovanni's poetry in the late 1960s and early 1970s addressed black womanhood and black manhood among other themes. In a book she co-wrote with James Baldwin entitled A Dialogue, the two authors speak blatantly about the status of the black male in the household. Baldwin challenges Giovanni's opinion on the representation of black women as the \\"breadwinners\\" in the household. Baldwin states: \\"A man is not a woman. And whether he's wrong or right... Look, if we're living in the same house and you're my wife or my woman, I have to be responsible for that house.\\"Baldwin, James and Nikki Giovanni. \\"Excerpt from A Dialogue.\\" Nikki Giovanni and Virginia C. Fowler, Conversations with Nikki Giovanni, Jackson: University of Mississippi, 1992. 70–79. Conversely, Giovanni recognizes the black man's strength, whether or not he is \\"responsible\\" for the home or economically advantaged. The interview makes it clear that regardless of who is \\"responsible\\" for the home, the black woman and the black man should be dependent on one another. In a 1972 Soul! interview with Mohammed Ali, Giovanni uses her popularity as a speaker to a broader audience to read some of her essay \\"Gemini\\" from her book, Gemini. In the excerpt from that essay, Giovanni intones, \\"we are born men and women...we need some happiness in our lives, some hope, some love...I really like to think a black, beautiful loving world is possible.\\" Such themes appeared throughout her early poetry which focused on race and gender dynamics in the black community. Giovanni tours nationwide and frequently speaks out against hate-motivated violence. At a 1999 Martin Luther King Day event, she recalled the 1998 murders of James Byrd, Jr. and Matthew Shepard: \\"What's the difference between dragging a black man behind a truck in Jasper, Texas, and beating a white boy to death in Wyoming because he's gay?\\"\\"Giovanni tells students to 'sail on'\\", University of Michigan's The University Record, January 25, 1999. Those Who Ride the Night Winds (1983) acknowledged black figures. Giovanni collected her essays in the 1988 volume Sacred Cows ... and Other Edibles. Her more recent works include Acolytes, a collection of 80 new poems, and On My Journey Now. Acolytes is her first published volume since her 2003 Collected Poems. The work is a celebration of love and recollection directed at friends and loved ones, and it recalls memories of nature, theater, and the glories of children. However, Giovanni's fiery persona still remains a constant undercurrent in Acolytes, as some of the most serious verse links her own life struggles (being a black woman and a cancer survivor) to the wider frame of African- American history and the continual fight for equality. Giovanni's collection Bicycles: Love Poems (2009) is a companion work to her 1997 Love Poems. Both works touch on the deaths of her mother, her sister, and those massacred on the Virginia Tech campus. \\"Tragedy and trauma are the wheels\\" of the bicycle. The first poem (\\"Blacksburg Under Siege: 21 August 2006\\") and the last poem (\\"We Are Virginia Tech\\") reflect this. Giovanni chose the title of the collection as a metaphor for love itself, \\"because love requires trust and balance.\\"Interview with Bill Moyers, February 13, 2009. In Chasing Utopia: A Hybrid (2013), Giovanni describes falling off of a bike and her mother saying, \\"Come here, Nikki and I will pick you up.\\" She has explained that it was comforting to hear her mother say this, and that \\"it took me the longest to realize – no, she made me get up myself.\\"Sara Kugler, \\"Nikki Giovanni reflects on 'Chasing Utopia,' and other struggles\\", Melissa Harris-Perry, MSNBC, December 16, 2013. Chasing Utopia continues as a hybrid (poetry and prose) work about food as a metaphor and as a connection to the memory of her mother, sister, and grandmother. The theme of the work is love relationships.\\"Writer Nikki Giovanni\\", Tavis Smiley, PBS, November 18, 2013. In 2004, Giovanni was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards for her album The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection. This was a collection of poems that she read against the backdrop of gospel music.(29) She also featured on the track \\"Ego Trip by Nikki Giovanni\\" on Blackalicious's 2000 album Nia. In November 2008, a song cycle of her poems, Sounds That Shatter the Staleness in Lives by Adam Hill, was premiered as part of the Soundscapes Chamber Music Series in Taos, New Mexico. She was commissioned by National Public Radio's All Things Considered to create an inaugural poem for President Barack Obama. The poem, entitled “Roll Call: A Song of Celebration,” ends with the following enthusiastic, optimistic three lines: \\"Yes We Can/Yes We Can/Yes We Can.\\" Giovanni read poetry at the Lincoln Memorial as a part of the bi-centennial celebration of Lincoln's birth on February 12, 2009. Giovani was part of the 2016 Writer's Symposium by the Sea at Loma Nazarene University. The University of California Television (UCTV) published the readings of Giovanni at the symposium. In October 2017 Giovani published her newest collection A Good Cry: What We Learn From Tears and Laughter. This collection includes poems that pay homage to the greatest influences on her life whom have passed away, including close friend Maya Angelou who died in 2014. Giovani often reads from her book. In one reading she shares her poem, “I Married My Mother.” In 2017, Giovanni presented at a TEDx event. Here she read the poem, “My Sister and Me.” She called her and her sister, “Two little chocolate girls.” After reading the poem she claims, “Sometimes you write a poem because damnit, you want to.”  Awards  Sources: *Keys to more than two dozen American cities, including New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and New Orleans *State Historical markers in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Lincoln Heights, Ohio *Seven NAACP Image Awards: Love Poems (1998) Blues: For All the Changes (1999) Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea (2003) Acolytes (2008) Hip Hop Speaks to Children (2009) 100 Best African American Poems (2011) Bicycles (2010) *National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1968) *Harlem Cultural Council (1969) *Woman of the Year, Ebony Magazine (1970) *Woman of the Year, Mademoiselle magazine (1971) *Woman of the Year, Ladies' Home Journal (1972) *National Association of Radio and Television Announcers Award for Best Spoken Word Album, for Truth Is on Its Way (1972) *National Book Award Nomination for Gemini (1973) *Life Membership & Scroll, The National Council of Negro Women (1973) *Woman of the Year, Cincinnati YWCA (1983) *The Ohio Women's Hall of Fame (1985) *Outstanding Woman of Tennessee (1985) *Duncanson Artist in Residence, The Taft Museum (1986) *The Post-Corbett Award (1986) *The Children's Reading Roundtable of Chicago Award for Vacation Time (1988) *The Ohioana Library Award for Sacred Cows (1988) *The Cecil H. and Ida Green Honors Chair, Texas Christian University (1991) *The Hill Visiting Professor, University of Minnesota (1993) *Tennessee Writer's Award, The Nashville Banner (1994) *The Tennessee Governor's Award in the Humanities (1996) *The Langston Hughes Award for Distinguished Contributions to Arts and Letters (1996) *Parents' Choice Award for The Sun Is So Quiet (1996) *Artist- in-Residence.

Hart was born on June 25, 1881, in Utica, New York. His parents were H. Gilbert Hart and Lucy Lord Kimball. In 1904, he obtained a BA from Harvard University (in the same class as Franklin D. Roosevelt). He spent a half year studying in Germany. He then studied law. Career In 1905, he joined his father's law firm, Hart-Crouse Company. He formed the \\"Industrial Liberty League.\\" He then became a director of the New York Radiator Company of Utica, the Chamber of Commerce, and the First National Bank (of which his grandfather Ephraim Hart had also been a director). In 1906, Hart was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly (Oneida Co., 1st D.) in 1907 and 1908. On June 11, 1908, he sponsored the Hart–Agnew Law, an anti-gambling bill passed by the New York Legislature that led to a complete shutdown of horse racing in the State (1911–1912). In 1909, he formed the \\"Republic League of Oneida County.\\" In 1911, Hart was admitted to the New York bar. In 1914, he formed the \\"Mutual Workmen's Compensation Insurance Company\\", later the Utica Mutual Insurance Company. During the First World War, Hart served in France, as Captain, although the Army first wanted Hart to serve in Ordnance; interference by Roosevelt helped Hart get his demanded commission. After the War, Hart returned to practicing law. From 1926 to 1929, Hart was a member of the New York Industrial Survey Commission. In April 1929, Hart and others founded the \\"New York State-wide Economic Council\\", a legislative lobbying organization that sought to curtail government interference into the economy in the aftermath of the economic collapse in 1929. Roosevelt's New Deal would provide for new challenges to the organization, especially to Hart personally, who saw in the New Deal something far removed from the American way of life. Another factor, Hart believed, too, was interfering with society: Communism. In 1931, the council renamed itself the \\"New York State Economic Council\\": Hart gave up practice of the law to become its president. In 1937 Hart toured Europe and was happy to see that at least one country could stop the Communist menace, Franco's Spain. In the 1940s, Hart became briefly a target of Secretary of State Harold L. Ickes. Ickes spoke about \\"fifth column\\" interference in the United States at an address at Columbia University, and classified Hart as being part of the \\"native fascist minded group.\\" Hart demanded a retraction by Ickes, saying that his \\"statements are absolutely false.\\" In reply, Ickes offered Hart a \\"trade.\\" \\"I will retract my statement gladly when I hear that you have come out to fight against the asserted gangs of native Fascists and fifth columnists that are trying to pave the way for the dictators here as they prepared it in other lands; when I hear that you have come out in defense of civil liberties and American democracy. Until then, my dear sir, you remain in my eyes, and in the eyes of the American people, what I said you were.\\" An unsatisfied Hart replied, \\"I am and always have been absolutely opposed to fascism, nazism and communism in the United States ... [they] are building up in Washington a government well-nigh as fascistic, as despotic, as anything in the dictator countries of Europe.\\" Ickes would later denounce Hart as a bigot, one of the five American \\"Quislings.\\" Hart accused Ickes of slander again. In 1943, the council changed its name again, this time to the National Economic Council.\\" A few noted libertarians did some work, Albert Jay Nock, Frank Chodorov and Garet Garrett, but none joined the Council. The National Economic Council itself would work together with the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government during the next years, a committee founded by Frank Gannett. After World War II, Hart tried to set up a political action committee, but did not find enough followers. In 1947, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith cited Merwin K. Hart's National Economic Council along with Gerald L. K. Smith's Christian Nationalist Crusade and the Ku Klux Klan as organized anti-Jewish organizations... which had significant influence, resources and membership.\\" The trouble did not stop there. Slowly over the years, conspiracist views had entered the worldview of Hart, which became now even more overt in the writings of the council. In 1960, Hart became a chairman of the New York branch of the John Birch Society. Although he denied allegations of anti-Semitism before the Buchanan committee, the 1961 letter of the National Economic Council carried the following statement: > ... If there were 6,000,000 Jews within reach of Hitler, which number is > widely questioned, and if they have all disappeared, where are they? ... Is > it not likely that many of these 6,000,000 claimed to have been killed by > Hitler and Eichmann are right here in the United States and are now joining > in the agitation for more and more support for the state of Israel—even if > the American Republic goes down. A few years after Hart's death, the indebted National Economic Council was conveyed to Willis Carto. Personal life and death On November 20, 1909, Hart married Katherine Margaret Crouse. His second wife was Constance Gray. He had three sons. Hart was a fourth-generation member of Masonic Order Utica Lodge 47. Hart died on November 30, 1962. Legacy Hart appears as a McCarthy-style Red hunter in The Vital Center (1949), in which author Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. describes his efforts in the late 1940s: > The most recent textbook witch-hunt provides an edifying example. In August > 1947, on the letterhead of an organization calling itself the National > Economic Council, Inc., a man named Merwin K. Hart wrote to every member of > the boards of trustees of colleges using Elements of Economics, an economic > text written by Professor Lorie Tarshis of Stanford University. An enclosed > review denounced the book for its exposition of the doctrines of Lord Keynes > and identified Keynseianism as a form of Marxism. > Hart's letter had an immediate effect. Organizations of small businessmen > passed resolutions in his support. Trusettes and alumni wrote outraged > letters to college presidents. Yet who was Merwin K. Hart? His record had > been long known to students of the American proto-fascist demimonde ... > Fortunately enough college presidents knew Hart's record to stand up > courageously to the uproar ...

It was the fourth track on their sixth studio album Northern Lights – Southern Cross (1975), written by member Robbie Robertson. Richard Manuel, Levon Helm and Rick Danko trade off lead vocals and harmonize on the chorus. Overview The song is a portrayal of the troubled history of Nova Scotia and Acadia. Specifically, it is about the Expulsion of the Acadians during the rivalry between the French and the British over what is now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and most of Maine. Robertson's lyrics were influenced by Longfellow's poem Evangeline, which describes the deportation of Acadians. On The Band's recording of the song, the lead vocal is traded on the verses between Richard Manuel, Levon Helm, and Rick Danko, with all three singers harmonizing on the choruses. Instrumentally, the recording is noted for its overdubbed fiddle playing by Byron Berline. Robertson took poetic license with the historical record. The deportations happened during the French and Indian War that had erupted in North America prior to the opening of the wider conflict of the Seven Years War, so \\"the war\\" was not \\"over\\" but in fact had only just begun. The expulsion commenced immediately after the British capture of Fort Beauséjour (1755) in present-day New Brunswick and not after \\"What went down on the Plains of Abraham,\\" a battle fought in 1759 in Quebec. The deportations ended when the war ended, with the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1763). AllMusic critic Rob Bowman described \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" as \\"a slightly more complex and ambitious (and successful) down-north analog to \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\\" The Sarasota Herald-Tribune affirmed the relationship with \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\\" noting that it had much of \\"the tone and historical sensitivity\\" as the earlier song. The Herald-Tribune further noted that the song deals with the theme in a way that not only highlights the plight of the Acadians but also relates it to continuing oppression in the world. Reception Bowman rated \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" as \\"one of Robertson's finest compositions, equal to anything else the Band ever recorded.\\" According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Mark Kemp, \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" is one of three songs on Northern Lights – Southern Cross, along with \\"Ophelia\\" and \\"It Makes No Difference,\\" on which \\"Robertson reclaims his reputation as one of rock's great songwriters. Music critic Colin Larkin concurred that it is \\"one of Robertson's most evocative compositions.\\" Music critic Barney Hoskyns considers it and \\"It Makes No Difference\\" to be \\"the most moving songs Robertson had written in five years.\\" Dave Zurawik of The Milwaukee Sentinel praises the way the song \\"rattle in [his] head and reverberates off [his] unconscious\\" for a long time. Rolling Stone commented that in spite of a few factual inaccuracies, \\"there's no better single song that spotlights the voices of Rick Danko, Levon Helm and Richard Manuel than Acadian Driftwood ... The song is absolutely beautiful and features stellar fiddle work by Byron Berline\\". https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the- bands-10-greatest-songs-20131204/5-acadian-driftwood-0780013 In his book American Driftwood, about the history of Cajun and Zydeco music, Paul-Emile Comeau states that American Songwriter magazine called \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" a masterpiece of Acadian music. In addition to the book, Comeau produced a 13-part series called the Connexion Acadiene for CBC Radio and NPR.https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18617568-acadian-driftwood Personnel *Richard Manuel - lead and backing vocals, clavinet *Levon Helm - lead and backing vocals, drums *Rick Danko - lead and backing vocals, bass guitar *Robbie Robertson - acoustic guitar (open tuning) *Garth Hudson - accordion, piccolo, chanter *Byron Berline - fiddle Performance history \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" was performed by The Band as part of their famous Last Waltz concert. The concert performance was omitted from the Martin Scorsese film of the concert and the original 1978 soundtrack, but was included in the 2002 box set soundtrack. Richard Shindell also covered the song on his 2007 album South of Delia, as did The Roches on the 2007 multi-artist tribute album, Endless Highway: The Music of The Band.

The product is often Palmitoylcarnitine (thus the name), but other fatty acids may also be substrates. It is part of a family of enzymes called carnitine acyltransferases. This \\"preparation\\" allows for subsequent movement of the acyl carnitine from the cytosol into the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Three isoforms of CPT1 are currently known: CPT1A, CPT1B, and CPT1C. CPT1 is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme can be inhibited by malonyl CoA, the first committed intermediate produced during fatty acid synthesis. Its role in fatty acid metabolism makes CPT1 important in many metabolic disorders such as diabetes. Since its crystal structure is not known, its exact mechanism of action remains to be determined. Structure Carnitine bound in the catalytic site of CRAT, an enzyme homologous to CPT1. The catalytic histidine and stabilizing serine residues are colored orange. CPT1 is an integral membrane protein that associates with the mitochondrial outer membrane through transmembrane regions in the peptide chain. Both the N- and C-terminal domains are exposed to the cytosolic side of the membrane. Three isoforms of CPT1 exist in mammalian tissues. The liver isoform (CPT1A or CPTI-L) is found throughout the body on the mitochondria of all cells except for skeletal muscle cells and brown adipose cells. The muscle isoform (CPT1B or CPTI-M) is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle cells and brown adipose cells. A third isoform, the brain isoform (CPT1C), was isolated in 2002. It is expressed predominantly in the brain and testes. Little is known about CPT1C. The exact structure of any of the CPT1 isoforms has not yet been determined, although a variety of in silico models for CPT1 have been created based on closely related carnitine acyltransferases, such as carnitine acetyltransferase (CRAT). An important structural difference between CPT1 and CPT2, CRAT and carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) is that CPT1 contains an additional domain at its N-terminal consisting of about 160 amino acids. It has been determined that this additional N-terminal domain is important for the key inhibitory molecule of CPT1, malonyl-CoA. Two distinct binding sites have been proposed to exist in CPT1A and CPT1B. The “A site” or “CoA site” appears to bind both malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA, as well as other molecules containing coenzyme A, suggesting that the enzyme binds these molecules via interaction with the coenzyme A moiety. It has been suggested that malonyl-CoA may behave as a competitive inhibitor of CPT1A at this site. A second “O site” has been proposed to bind malonyl-CoA more tightly than the A site. Unlike the A site, the O site binds to malonyl-CoA via the dicarbonyl group of the malonate moiety of malonyl-CoA. The binding of malonyl-CoA to either the A and O sites inhibits the action of CPT1A by excluding the binding of carnitine to CPT1A. Since a crystal structure of CPT1A has yet to be isolated and imaged, its exact structure remains to be elucidated. Function =Enzyme mechanism= Because crystal structure data is currently unavailable, the exact mechanism of CPT1 is not currently known. A couple different possible mechanisms for CPT1 have been postulated, both of which include the histidine residue 473 as the key catalytic residue. One such mechanism based upon a carnitine acetyltransferase model is shown below in which the His 473 deprotonates carnitine while a nearby serine residue stabilizes the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate. A different mechanism has been proposed that suggests that a catalytic triad composed of residues Cys-305, His-473, and Asp-454 carries out the acyl-transferring step of catalysis. This catalytic mechanism involves the formation of a thioacyl-enzyme covalent intermediate with Cys-305. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase mechanism. =Biological function= The carnitine palmitoyltransferase system is an essential step in the beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. This transfer system is necessary because, while fatty acids are activated (in the form of a thioester linkage to coenzyme A) on the outer mitochondrial membrane, the activated fatty acids must be oxidized within the mitochondrial matrix. Long chain fatty acids such as palmitoyl-CoA, unlike short- and medium-chain fatty acids, cannot freely diffuse through the mitochondrial inner membrane, and require a shuttle system to be transported to the mitochondrial matrix.Berg JM, Tymoczo JL, Stryer L, \\"Biochemistry\\", 6th edition 2007 Acyl-CoA from cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I is the first component and rate-limiting step of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase system, catalyzing the transfer of the acyl group from coenzyme A to carnitine to form palmitoylcarnitine. A translocase then shuttles the acyl carnitine across the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is converted back into palmitoyl-CoA. By acting as an acyl group acceptor, carnitine may also play the role of regulating the intracellular CoA:acyl-CoA ratio. =Regulation= CPT1 is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, although the exact mechanism of inhibition remains unknown. The CPT1 skeletal muscle and heart isoform, CPT1B, has been shown to be 30-100-fold more sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition than CPT1A. This inhibition is a good target for future attempts to regulate CPT1 for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, is important in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Scientists have demonstrated that ACC2 knockout mice have reduced body fat and weight when compared to wild type mice. This is a result of decreased activity of ACC which causes a subsequent decrease in malonyl-CoA concentrations. These decreased malonyl-CoA levels in turn prevent inhibition of CPT1, causing an ultimate increase in fatty acid oxidation. Since heart and skeletal muscle cells have a low capacity for fatty acid synthesis, ACC may act purely as a regulatory enzyme in these cells. Clinical significance The \\"CPT1A\\" form is associated with carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency. This rare disorder confers risk for hepatic encephalopathy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, seizures, and sudden unexpected death in infancy. CPT1 is associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Such diseases, along with many other health problems, cause free fatty acid (FFA) levels in humans to become elevated, fat to accumulate in skeletal muscle, and decreases the ability of muscles to oxidize fatty acids. CPT1 has been implicated in contributing to these symptoms. The increased levels of malonyl-CoA caused by hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia inhibit CPT1, which causes a subsequent decrease in the transport of long chain fatty acids into muscle and heart mitochondria, decreasing fatty acid oxidation in such cells. The shunting of LCFAs away from mitochondria leads to the observed increase in FFA levels and the accumulation of fat in skeletal muscle. Its importance in fatty acid metabolism makes CPT1 a potentially useful enzyme to focus on in the development of treatments of many other metabolic disorders as well.  Interactions  CPT1 is known to interact with many proteins, including ones from the NDUF family, PKC1, and ENO1. In HIV, Vpr enhances PPARbeta/delta-induced PDK4, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) mRNA expression in cells. Knockdown of CPT1A by shRNA library screening inhibits HIV-1 replication in cultured Jurkat T-cells.

It is a Latin text of 33 leaves held at the University of Göttingen. A quarto parchment manuscript of 33 leaves, ff. 1–15a are a discussion of twelve chess openings, f. 16 is blank, and ff. 17–31b are a selection of thirty chess problems, one on each page with a diagram and solution. Authorship and exact date of the manuscript are unknown. Similarities to Lucena's Repeticion de Amores e Arte de Axedres con CL iuegos de partido (c. 1497) have led some scholars to surmise that it was written by Lucena or that it was one of Lucena's sources. Although the manuscript is generally assumed to be older than Lucena's work, this is not established., points out that the manuscript seems more advanced than the works of Lucena to which it is compared, dealing only with modern chess and making no mention of the older rules. Arte de Axedres describes the differences between the old and new rules and includes problems using the old rules, making it a work in the period of transition to modern chess. Both works share some material, although it is possible that they both were drawing on older material. A later manuscript from the 16th century repeats the openings of the Göttingen manuscript in a slightly modernized form and attributes them to Lucena. If this is correct, it suggests that the Göttingen manuscript is Lucena's later and more mature work. The manuscript has been ascribed possible writing dates of 1500–1505 or 1471.Dr. Fritz Clemens Görschen (1911–1981) writes in Schach Echo (1975) that King Alfonso V of Portugal had the manuscript when he visited France in the winter of 1474–5 and that it had been written in 1471 , although , brands this as speculation. The manuscript is exclusively devoted to modern chess (using the modern rules of movement for the pawn, bishop, and queen, although castling had not yet taken its current form), and no mention is made of the earlier form. The rules are not explained, so the manuscript must have been written at a time and place when the new rules were well established, or it was addressed to a player familiar with the new rules. The addressee of the manuscript is not named, but was evidently a nobleman of high rank.The text for the first sample game begins: \\"Thus your lordship plays the king's pawn to the fourth square from the king's place, and if the opponent does the same, play the king's knight to the third square of the king's bishop, and if he guards the pawn with the pawn of the king's bishop, take his pawn with the knight…\\". The second begins: \\"Let us suppose, magnificent lord, that he does not guard his king's pawn with the pawn of his bishop but with that of the queen…\\". Some particulars of the manuscript suggest that the author was from Spain or Portugal and that it was copied at some point in France, although this is not certain.F.C. Görschen found that the style and syntax of the Latin text indicate a Spanish or Portuguese speaker as the author . Indications suggesting that the manuscript was copied in France or that the author was French include: (1) At the beginning of the manuscript bishop is called stultus rather than the more familiar alphinus. (In French, the bishop is the fou.) (2) The names used on the chess diagrams are R (roy), D (dame), Fo (fol), Ch (chevalier), Ro (roc), and P (Pion). (3) The manuscript uses a form of king's leap (the predecessor of castling) that is associated with French and Spanish chess . Openings The attention paid to the opening in the manuscript reflected the greater importance of study of the early part of the game caused by the changes to the movement of the pieces in modern chess. The old game tended to develop slowly, with victory often achieved by capturing all enemy pieces to the bare king. The modern game developed much more quickly due to the new ability of the pawn to make an initial move of two squares, and the greatly enhanced powers of the bishop and queen. Checkmate became a more common end to the game, and study was required to develop early attacks and defend against them. Subsequent chess writing would continue to emphasise study of the opening (; ). The twelve openings in the manuscript include four attacks in which the Prince to whom the work is addressed is the first player, and eight defences where he is the second player. They include one example each of 1.c4 (English Opening) and 1.f4 (Bird's Opening), two examples of 1.d4 (Queen's Pawn Openings) including a Queen's Gambit, and eight examples of 1.e4 (King's Pawn Openings). Every King's Pawn Opening included is a Double King's Pawn Opening as Black always responds to 1.e4 with 1...e5. One example of the Bishop's Opening (2.Bc4) is given. The other seven King's Pawn Openings are King's Knight Openings (2.Nf3), to which the author seems to suggest that 2...Nc6 is the best defence . Although no evaluation of the resulting positions is given, some of the examples continue well into the middle game; the eighth is given through move 33. In the order in which they appear in the manuscript, the openings are: # Damiano Defence (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6) # Philidor Defence (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6), example favoring White # Giuoco Piano (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5) # Petrov Defence (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6) # Bishop's Opening (1.e4 e5 2.Bc4) # Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Bc5 Classical Defence) # Ponziani Opening (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3) # Philidor Defence, example favoring Black # Queen's Gambit Accepted (1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4) # 1.d4 d5 2.Bf4 Bf5 (a form of the London System) # Bird's Opening (1.f4) # English Opening (1.c4) Problems All thirty problems are also found in Lucena's work, and all but one (number 24) are found in Damiano. Many of the thirty problems are given special conditions, such as specific pieces that cannot move or requirements that mate be delivered by a pawn or by two consecutive checks by pawns .

In 1938 he started the zoo at 65 Hayarkon Street. After some lions and tigers were donated to the zoo, it caused too much disruption in the neighborhood, and was moved to its location behind city hall in 1939. In the late 1960s and the 1970s the zoo was one of the few zoos in the world to successfully breed flamingos. In 1981, the animals were moved out of the city to the Zoological Center of Tel Aviv-Ramat Gan. The Gan Ha'Ir shopping mall now occupies the site of the former zoo.

They are most commonly used by motorcycle riders when temperatures are low. They usually obtain power for their heating processes through a cord which can be plugged into the motorcycle's electric system. An additional socket is installed on the vehicle for that purpose, or if the vehicle has a mobile charger/cigarette lighter receptacle available, then the cord is directly plugged into that socket. Other electric jackets with self-contained power sources are in existence, and are useful for more portable situations where the vehicle's 12 volt supply is not available. Uses Uses include biking, skiing, hiking, hunting, fishing and spectator sports. The newer versions use lithium rechargeable batteries. The latest versions use lithium polymer batteries which have a high energy density and are relatively lightweight.

This protein is involved in the active cellular uptake of carnitine. It acts a symporter, moving sodium ions and other organic cations across the membrane along with carnitine. Such polyspecific organic cation transporters in the liver, kidney, intestine, and other organs are critical for the elimination of many endogenous small organic cations as well as a wide array of drugs and environmental toxins. Mutations in the SLC22A5 gene cause systemic primary carnitine deficiency, which can lead to heart failure.  Structure  The SLC22A5 gene, containing 10 exons,Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM®. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. MIM Number: {603377}: {04/29/2015}: . World Wide Web URL: https://omim.org/ is located on the q arm of chromosome 5 in position 31.1 and spans 25,910 base pair. The gene produces a 63 kDa protein composed of 557 amino acids. The protein has 12 putative transmembrane domains, with a long extracellular loop of 107 amino acids between the first two transmembrane domains and an intracellular loop between the fourth and fifth transmembrane domains. This long extracellular loop has three potential sites for N-glycosylation, and the intracellular loop has an ATP/GTP binding motif. In putative intracellular domains, there are five potential sites for protein-kinase C-dependent phosphorylation and one for protein-kinase A-dependent phosphorylation.  Function  The SLC22A5 gene codes for a plasma integral membrane protein which functions as both an organic cation transporter and a sodium-dependent high affinity carnitine transporter. The encoded protein is involved in the active cellular uptake of carnitine, transporting one sodium ion with one molecule of carnitine. Organic cations transported by this protein include tetraethylammonium (TEA) without involvement of sodium. The relative uptake activity ratio of carnitine to TEA is 11.3.  Clinical Significance  The main phenotypical effect of autosomal recessive mutations, either compound heterozygous or homozygous, in the SLC22A5 gene is systemic primary carnitine deficiency, characterized by impaired carnitine transport, urinary carnitine wasting, low serum carnitine levels, reduced intracellular carnitine accumulation, impaired beta oxidation, and cytosolic fatty acid accumulation. Patients often display metabolic decompensation, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, Reye syndrome, and sudden infant death in their first year, followed by the later onset of cardiomyopathy or skeletal myopathy, arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and heart failure in early childhood. Patients may be asymptomatic, with about 70% of asymptomatic patients having a missense mutation or in-frame deletion; nonsense mutation frequency is increased in symptomatic patients. The symptoms and outcome of the disease can be drastically improved by replacement therapy with L-carnitine. The estimated incidence of primary carnitine deficiency in newborns is about 1 in 40,000.  Interactions  SLC22A5 interacts with PDZK1.

Tourism in Nicaragua has grown considerably recently, and it is now the second largest industry in the nation. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has stated his intention to use tourism to combat poverty throughout the country. The growth in tourism has positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry. The results for Nicaragua's tourism-driven economy have been significant, with the nation welcoming one million tourists in a calendar year for the first time in its history in 2010.http://www.sify.com/news/nicaragua-exceeds-one-mn-foreign- tourists-for-first-time-news-international-km4ladiidea.html Nicaragua exceeds one mn foreign tourists for first time In mid-2018, tourism in Nicaragua came to a virtual standstill due to the 2018-2019 Nicaraguan protests. History During the Nicaraguan Revolution in the 1980s, Nicaragua was not regarded as a place to travel, which caused a decrease in tourism. However, rapid expansion of the tourist industry over the last decade has made it the nation's second largest industry. Over the last 7 years tourism has grown about 70% nationwide with rates of 10%-16% annually. Nicaragua is mostly famous for its landscapes, flora and fauna, wildlife, culture, beaches, lakes, and volcanoes. By 2010, the nation welcomed one million visitors—the most in its entire history for a calendar year. Nicaragua's tourism industry in 2010 raked in approximately 360 million dollars for the nation's economy.https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev;=_t&hl;=en&ie;=UTF-8&layout;=2&eotf;=1&sl;=es&tl;=en&u;=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/12/29/nacionales/47571&act;=url Up to a million tourists Nicaragua According to the Nicaraguan news program Canal 2 TV Noticias, the country's main tourist attractions are beaches, scenic routes, the architecture of cities such as León and Granada, and most recently ecotourism and agritourism, particularly in Northern Nicaragua. Tourism León Cathedral World Heritage Site In 2013, more than 1.2 million tourists visited Nicaragua, representing an increase of nearly a third from 2009. Two-thirds of these tourists were from other Central American countries, 290,000 were from North America and 80,000 from Europe. Of those that come for recreation, their principal activities include surfing, hiking volcanoes and getting to know the country's nature trails. According to the Ministry of Tourism of Nicaragua (INTUR) the colonial city of Granada is the preferred spot for tourists. The city's central park, Parqué Colón, hosts many vendors of traditional foods and arts and crafts, and there are always several horse-drawn carriages ready to give thorough and affordable tours of the city. Venturing outside of the city limits, one can explore the verdant islets of Granada by a relaxing guided boat ride or by kayak. The islets also have hotels for those that wish to take in the sunrise from the Mombacho Volcano, a common day destination for those interested in climbing into a cloud forest. The Apoyo Lagoon is also a popular destination for those visiting Granada. Also, the cities of León, Masaya, Rivas and the likes of San Juan del Sur, San Juan River, Ometepe, Mombacho Volcano, and others are the main tourist attractions. Ecotourism and surfing also attract many tourists. Another popular destination are the Corn Islands located about 70 km east off the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua near Bluefields. They have been regarded as a \\"tropical paradise\\" by the Los Angeles Times. Cruise ships have been docking in San Juan del Sur since January 2000 and average 50,000 tourists alone every year, some who partake in tours to nearby Lake Cocibolca and the colonial city of Granada. A view of the Montelimar Beach and the Barcelo Hotel and Resort in Managua Nicaragua was ranked with the lowest crime rate in Latin America by Interpol and many other sources, with only 12 crimes for every 100,000 citizens. Nicaragua also holds the largest lake in Central America, about 700 species of birds, and unspoiled natural beauty. Despite all this, it is still the least visited country in the region. However, the lower number of tourists help Nicaragua keep low prices, and an \\"off-the-beaten-track\\" feel. =Rural and community-based tourism= CECOCAFEN is an organization of coffee cooperatives in Northern Nicaragua that manage a rural and community-based tourism project, which has been developed with support from Lutheran World Relief. Tourism allows farmers to receive new opportunities in alternative markets, harvest coffee and diversify their income. CECOCAFEN offers visitors the opportunity to visit a coffee farm, learn about coffee craftsmanship, and even to stay overnight on a coffee farm and explore with a community guide. =Ecological tourism= Eco-tourism aims to be ecologically and socially conscious; it focuses on local culture, wilderness, and adventure. Nicaragua's eco-tourism grows every year, as the country boasts a number of eco-tourist tours and perfect places for adventurers. Nicaragua has three eco-regions, the Pacific, Central and Atlantic, which contain volcanoes, tropical rainforest and agricultural land. The majority of ecolodges and other environmentally- focused touristic destinations are found on Ometepe Island, found in the middle of Lake Nicaragua, an hour's boat ride from Granada. While some are foreign-owned, such as the tropical permaculture lodge at Finca El Zopilote,Finca El Zopilote others are owned by local families, like the small but acclaimed Finca Samaria.Finca Samaria or la Puesta del Sol near Moyogualpa Nicaragua is home to 78 protected areas covering over 20% of its landmass, and is home to 7% of the world's biodiversity. This is more than Costa Rica, which is thought to hold more natural areas than Nicaragua. Nicaragua is also home to Bosawas, located in Northern Nicaragua, which is the largest rainforest north of the Amazon in Brazil. It also holds the largest lake in Central America, Lake Cocibolca, also known as Lake Nicaragua. Lake Cocibolca attracts a fair number of tourists yearly, most of whom visit Ometepe, a large volcanic island formed by two volcanoes in the lake. Tourists may explore the flora and fauna found in the Charco Verde Nature Reserve. Nicaragua's rich biodiversity also attracts many tourists to protected areas such as the Indio Maíz Biological Reserve, which holds a higher number in species of trees, birds, and insects than all of Europe. International tourist arrivals After its renovation, Nicaragua's Augusto C. Sandino International Airport stands as the most modern airport in Central America. =International airport= Nicaragua only has one international airport, the Augusto C. Sandino International Airport, located in Managua. A large expansion and renovation programme was undertaken between 2003-2006 to modernise the facilities. =Visa regulations= Tourists from Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Ghana, Haiti, India, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, the Palestinian National Authority, Romania, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Vietnam and Yemen require a visa to enter Nicaragua. Other tourists can obtain a Tourist Card for US$10 valid for 1 month upon arrival, provided with a valid passport with at least six months to run. There is also a US$32 departure tax (the tax is usually already included in a round-trip ticket). Tourist attractions =Volcanoes= Sand skiing down the Cerro Negro volcano Nicaragua is referred to as \\"the land of lakes and volcanoes\\" due to the number of its lagoons and lakes, and the chain of volcanoes that runs from the north to the south along the country's Pacific side. Today, only 7 of the 50 volcanoes in Nicaragua are considered active. Many of these volcanoes offer some great possibilities for tourists with activities such as hiking, climbing, camping, and swimming in crater lakes. Sand skiing has become a popular attraction at the Cerro Negro volcano in León. Both dormant and active volcanoes can be climbed. Some of the most visited volcanoes include the Masaya Volcano, Momotombo, Mombacho, Cosigüina and Ometepe's Maderas and Concepción. The Masaya Volcano is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Nicaragua. It is one of 18 distinct volcanic centres that make up the Nicaraguan portion of the Central American Volcanic Belt (CAVF). The Apoyo Lagoon was created by the eruption of the Apoyo Volcano about 23,000 years ago, which left a huge 7 km-wide crater that gradually filled with water. It is surrounded by the old crater wall. The rim of the lagoon is lined with restaurants, many of which have kayaks available. Besides exploring the forest around it, many water sports are practiced in the lagoon, most notably kayaking. Another popular attraction is the archipelago of 365 islands known as the Islets of Granada (Isletas de Granada). The islets were formed when the Mombacho volcano blew most of its cone into the lake, thereby creating the archipelago. The islets are popular with both locals and tourists. The islets differ in size and have a community of about 1200 people, most of whom make their living as fishermen. Many visitors take boat rides along the islets, which are abundant with many different species of birds and fish such as cormorants, herons, kingfisher, oropendola, hawks and many more.

Awards * The 1921 VFL Premiership team was Richmond. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Cliff Rankin of Geelong with 61 goals. * Essendon took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1921. * The Victorian Junior League premiership, which is today recognised as the VFL reserves premiership, was won by 's team, Essendon Juniors. Essendon Juniors 10.9 (69) defeated Collingwood District 8.13 (61) in the challenge Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the senior Grand Final on 15 October at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Notable events Carlton, the minor premier of the season * Umpires demand that the VFL provides greater protection, including the wire netting of the umpire's race to the ground (in order to protect them from fists, projectiles and, particularly, ladies' hat-pins) and a stronger police guard. * In the last quarter of the Round 7 match between Richmond and Essendon at the Punt Road Oval, Richmond had kicked a point. The ball was returned from the crowd to the Essendon full-back Bert Day who was on the boundary line, not the goal line. The ball had been stabbed by someone in the crowd. Day, noticing the deflated condition of the ball, kicked it idly from the boundary line over to the field Umpire (E. P. Willamson) to inspect. Richmond full-forward George Bayliss pounced on the ball and kicked a goal with it. Day's kick from the boundary line was mistakenly treated as if it had been a kick out from the goal line and, despite all of Essendon's protests, a goal was awarded to Bayliss. * In Round 11, St Kilda failed to score a goal, and lost badly to a Fitzroy team that had four fewer scoring shots: Fitzroy 6.8 (44) to St Kilda 0.18 (18). * Prior to the Round 12 match between St Kilda and Carlton, a \\"ladies\\" football match was played between two female teams, \\"The Chorleys\\" and \\"The Fleetwoods\\", to the delight of the crowd. The Fleetwoods won 4.2 (26) to 2.4 (16). Whilst the women played in men's guernseys, shorts, socks, boots, etc. the (male) field umpire wore a dress. * The fourth Australian Football Carnival was held in Perth. Western Australia were the Australian Champions. * In Round 17, Essendon played its last match at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, before the ground was closed to make way for an expansion of the Flinders Street railyards. During the season, the club made arrangements to find a new home base for 1922, initially looking to move to the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve, and finally settling on the Essendon Recreation Reserve when a move to North Melbourne was blocked. * The Preliminary Final on 8 October, played between Richmond and Carlton, was played in deep mud, and the second half was delayed until a driving hail- storm, that had turned the Melbourne Cricket Ground's playing surface white, had passed. The second half was played with the surface covered with pools of water six inches deep. (The VFA preliminary final, played at the nearby East Melbourne Cricket Ground, was abandoned in the third quarter and replayed the following week due to the same hail-storm). * The five drawn matches during the 1921 season remains a VFL/AFL record for most draws in one season.

During Chen Dynasty  Chen Shuda was born in 572.His elder brother Chen Shushen was born in 572, and his younger brothers Chen Shu'ao and Chen Shuxing had a common mother while Chen Shuxing was born in 573. He was the 17th of 42 sons of Emperor Xuan of Chen. His mother was Consort Yuan, a concubine of Emperor Xuan who carried the rank of Zhaorong (), the eighth highest rank among imperial consorts, who had two other sons—his older brother Chen Shuwen (), later created the Prince of Jinxi, and his younger brother Chen Shutan (), later created the Prince of Xinhui. In 582, just after Emperor Xuan died and was succeeded by Chen Shuda's oldest brother Chen Shubao the Crown Prince, Chen Shubao created Chen Shuda, along with his other brothers Chen Shuyan (), Chen Shushen (), and Chen Shuyu (), princes, and Chen Shuda's title was Prince of Yiyang. Chen Shuda was also given a minor general title. In 587, Chen Shubao made him the mayor of the capital Jiankang. During Chen Shubao's reign, Chen Shuda was one of the officials known for literary talent, and Chen Shubao often invited him, along with those other officials, into the palace to feast, write poems, and recite them with him and some of the concubines with literary talent as well. Once, he impressed the chancellor Xu Ling () by writing a poem that had 10 rhymes during a feast.  During Sui Dynasty  In 589, Sui Dynasty forces destroyed Chen, reuniting China. Chen Shubao and the rest of the Chen imperial clan, other than Chen Shushen, who continued to resist after Chen Shubao surrendered and who was executed after being captured, were treated well by Emperor Wen of Sui after they were taken to the Sui capital Chang'an. Chen Shuda entered Sui governmental service as a minor official, although his title at the time is not recorded in history. During the reign of Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang, he was made Neishi Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of the government (內史省, Neishi Sheng), and later the deputy governor of Jiang Commandery (絳郡, part of modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), acting as governor. In 617, the Sui general Li Yuan the Duke of Tang rebelled at Taiyuan and advanced toward Chang'an. When his army arrived at Jiang Commandery, Chen Shuda surrendered the commandery to his forces, and he was made a secretary on Li Yuan's staff and created the Duke of Handong, sharing important secretarial duties with Wen Daya (). It was said that Li Yuan's military correspondences, as well as edicts later issued in the name of Yang You (the grandson of Emperor Yang, whom Li Yuan declared emperor after capturing Chang'an later in 617) announcing general pardons and, later, passing the throne to Li Yuan in 618, were largely written by Chen Shuda.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  After Li Yuan assumed the throne in 618, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu, Chen Shuda was made the Huangmen Shilang (), the deputy head of the government's examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng). In 619, Emperor Gaozu made him Nayan () -- the head of the examination bureau, a post considered one for a chancellor. In 621, after the title of the head of the examination bureau was changed to Shizhong (), he continued to serve as Shizhong. It was said that Chen was well-spoken and handsome in appearance, and whenever he made an appearance before the emperor, the gentlemen at the capital were all looking at him. When famed people from south of the Yangtze River (i.e., the former Chen territory) visited Chang'an, he often recommended them for government service. In 630, Emperor Gaozu created him the greater title of Duke of Jiang. At one imperial feast, when grapes were served, Chen, instead of eating the grapes, held them in his hand, and when Emperor Gaozu asked him why, he responded, \\"My mother has a mouth ailment, and I have wanted to get her grapes but could not get them. I want to hold them and take them back to my mother.\\" Emperor Gaozu, who thus was reminded of his mother, stated, \\"It is a good thing you have a mother to take things back to.\\" He rewarded Chen with silk. Late in Emperor Gaozu's reign, an intense rivalry developed between his two oldest sons, Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince and Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, as Li Jiancheng, while a capable general himself, was overshadowed by Li Shimin, who had destroyed Tang's major enemies Xue Rengao the Emperor of Qin, Liu Wuzhou the Dingyang Khan, Wang Shichong the Emperor of Zheng, and Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia. Li Jiancheng and a brother who supported him, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, once accused Li Shimin of crimes, and Emperor Gaozu, believing in the accusations, was set to punish Li Shimin, when Chen interceded for Li Shimin, pointing out his great contributions, and Emperor Gaozu did not punish Li Shimin.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  In 626, Li Shimin, fearing that Li Jiancheng was about to kill him, set an ambush for Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji at Xuanwu Gate and killed them. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). Initially, Chen Shuda continued to serve as the head of the examination bureau, but later that year, in the middle of a major governmental reorganization by Emperor Taizong, Chen and another chancellor, Xiao Yu, argued at length before Emperor Taizong, and both were accused of being disrespectful and removed from their offices. Soon thereafter, Chen Shuda's mother died, and as Chen had previously himself been ill, Emperor Taizong feared for his physical well-being and ordered that guests not be allowed to visit Chen during his mourning. After he completed the mourning period, Emperor Taizong commissioned him as the commandant at Sui Prefecture (遂州, roughly modern Suining, Sichuan), but he, on account of illness, did not report to Sui Prefecture. Soon thereafter, Emperor Taizong made him the minister of ceremonies, stating to him, \\"During the Wude era [(Emperor Gaozu's era name)], I was in danger, but I know that you gave faithful words to the emperor. I thus commission you thus in return.\\" Chen responded, \\"I did not only do this for Your Imperial Majesty, but did so for the state.\\" At a later point, Chen was accused of sexual immorality. Emperor Taizong, as Chen was a well-known official, did not want his offense to be made public, and so had him retire with a minor office. He died in 634 and was initially given the unflattering posthumous name of Miao (繆, \\"inconsistent\\"). At a later point, he was posthumously awarded with the title of minister of census and had his posthumous name changed to Zhong (忠, \\"faithful\\").

It was part of the Toledo Public School District, serving students from the DeVeaux, Elmhurst, Grove Patterson, Longfellow, Mayfair, McKinley, Nathan Hale, Old Orchard, and Whittier elementary schools. The building still sits at 3301 Upton Avenue near the Central Avenue intersection. The DeVilbiss Tigers were members of the Toledo City League and donned the colors of orange and black. On the contrary, the school colors were the colors of the rainbow, hence the yearbook being the “pot of gold”, and the school newspaper/newsletter “the Prism”. Their main rivals were the Start Spartans, although rivalries existed with the St. Francis Knights and the Libbey Cowboys, whom they annually played football against on Thanksgiving day from 1933–1963. A map of campus Due to a declining enrollment and low finances, DeVilbiss was closed along with Macomber and Whitney high schools by TPS at the end of the 1990–1991 school year. The DeVilbiss district was split up so students could attend Bowsher, Rogers, Scott, or Start high schools. The building has been renovated by Duket Architects and currently serves as Toledo Technology Academy, which opened in 1997.

He participated in the famous Affair of the Diamond Necklace.  Early life  He was born in France near the city of Lyon in 1754. He was younger son of a minor aristocrat whose family lacked the financial resources to secure him a position suitable to his status in life. At a young age, Rétaux left home and enlisted in the army as an ordinary soldier. It is unknown how long he remained in military service or whether he was discharged honorably or deserted. However, by 1778, at the age of 19, he was known to be living in Paris and representing himself as the ‘Comte‘ de Villette, a title that really belonged to his elder brother. While in Paris, Rétaux supported himself by recruiting young women to work as prostitutes for which he was paid a fee by brothel owners. It is thought that he also worked as a male prostitute to help make ends meet. It was during that time that Villette developed a talent for forgery. While plying his trade, he was known to forge letters of credit for sums of money greater than what was owed for his services. In addition to the nefarious activities, Villette occasionally resorted to blackmailing his clients.  Affair of the Diamond Necklace  Through an intimate relationship with Jeanne de Saint-Rémy de Valois, the pair staged a scandal involving a diamond necklace. The famous Affair of the Diamond Necklace made history in France. Villette played the role of forger by writing letters to Jeanne in the hand of Queen Marie Antoinette to mske it seem as if the Queen desired the necklace but was unable to purchase it because of the reluctance on the part of King Louis XVI. The letters were presented in turn to Cardinal Rohan and persuaded him to buy the necklace for the Queen or so he thought. After the necklace had been purchased by Rohan and given to Saint-Remy to pass along to the queen, she and her husband, Nicolas de la Motte, immediately took off to London and began selling the jewels from the necklace for their own profit. Villette later testified against the La Mottes. The scheme was eventually exposed, and all of those involved were prosecuted, including Villette.  Later life  As punishment for his involvement in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, Villette was exiled from France. Moving to Italy, he wrote a book about the affair published in Venice in 1790 (three years before Marie Antoinette was executed).Mémoire historique des intrigues de la cour - De Villette's book on Google Books .

Biography James McBratney (a.k.a. \\"Jimmy From Queens\\") was born in 1941 to emigrant Catholic parents from Northern Ireland. He first met his longtime friend and fellow Irishman, Edward Maloney at Green Haven Correctional Facility where McBratney had been convicted of armed robbery. Maloney would later describe him as a \\"devoted family man\\". He stood 6'3\\", weighed 250 pounds, and was an avid weightlifter. Maloney later commented about McBratney's behavior while incarcerated saying, \\"he was quiet, a listener and learner and soon we were discussing heists we might do together.\\" He was knowledgeable about firearms and wanted to become a collector. He wanted to save up his illicit funds earned by armed robbery, kidnapping and gun running and open a night club. This would have been impossible for the liquor license board would have never awarded him the certificate because of his connections with the Gambino crime family and Colombo crime family, including his own personal extensive criminal record. It is wrongly perceived that McBratney was the leader of the kidnapping gang, while he did oversee the kidnappings he was just a \\"point man\\" and \\"middle man\\". Sometime in October 1972, Maloney was recruited to become a part of the kidnapping-ransom ring with McBratney, along with fellow Irish-American Warren Schurman and John Kilcullen, Italian-American Gambino crime family mob associate Robert Senter, a paternal uncle of Irish-Italian mob associate Anthony Senter and Colombo crime family mob associate Thomas Genovese, a distant paternal relative of Genovese crime family patriarch and founder Vito Genovese. It is unknown if McBratney had been told of the kidnapping operation by Gambino crime family street soldiers, Flippo and Ronald Miano who at the time were \\"made men\\" in the Gambino family. The Miano brothers reportedly told McBratney and the others they wanted 10% of the ransom payment and had thought up the kidnapping plan for what they called \\"revenge\\". Kidnapping of Frank Manzo They snatched Lucchese crime family capo Francesco Manzo in front of Jimmy Burke and Henry Hill as he was dining at Hill's restaurant The Suite in Forest Hills, New York. The kidnapping was orchestrated and conducted perfectly and McBratney and his crew members received $150,000 from Carmine Tramunti for Manzo's safe return. Following the kidnapping of Frank Manzo, McBratney and the crew conducted two more successful kidnappings of members of organized crime. The kidnapping of \\"Junior\\" On December 28, 1972, McBratney made arrangements to kidnap a Gambino crime family loanshark who Jerry Capeci and fellow investigative journalists only identify as \\"Junior\\". The loanshark was allegedly Vincent D'Amore, a capo in the Gambino crime family. Maloney approached \\"Junior\\" on the street, shoved a handgun into his stomach, and forced him into nearby waiting vehicle with McBratney, Genovese and Shurman. Junior fought his attempted kidnappers and Maloney pistolwhipped him before forcing him into the car's backseat so the gang could make a quick retreat. Unfortunately for McBratney and the others, two young boys witnessed the kidnapping, recording the license plate and turned it over to a relative with connections to organized crime. Shortly after leaving the scene, McBratney realized that in all the commotion and pandemonium, Warren Schurman had forgotten to put tape over \\"Junior\\"'s eyes. Enraged at Schurman's incompetence and lack of preparation, he slammed on the brakes to yell at them. When the car came to an abrupt stop \\"Junior\\" ran for his life as McBratney opened fire on him. Schurman jumped out of the car and doubled back to Maloney who was driving a vehicle behind them, with Genovese. Maloney later stated he was sure McBratney was going to murder Schurman for his mistake. Gangland slaying McBratney was at Snoope's Bar and Grill on Staten Island on May 22, 1973. He had left his machine gun in his Cadillac. He ordered a drink and John, Angelo, and Ralph came in. They strode to the rear of the bar where he sat. Angelo was on his left, Ralph Galione on his right, and John Gotti behind; Galione had a gun, Angelo a pair of handcuffs. The three of them began pulling McBratney up and away from the bar. Ralph Galione told him, \\"You're under arrest. You've been this route before; don't give us any trouble.\\" After a patron attempted to intervene Galione fired two shots into the ceiling of the restaurant. Galione ordered the other patrons and employees, including a young 16 year old dishwasher, to stand against a wall, but a waitress had slipped away and called the police from a payphone. McBratney struggled with Angelo, John, and Ralph and managed to drag all of them several feet toward the end of the bar, but could not get free. Galione walked toward McBratney, who was standing between John and Angelo, and fired three times at close range, killing him. The murder is referenced in the 1996 HBO made-for-TV film Gotti, in a murder which helped to establish Gotti as a force in the Gambino crime family.

It has the only Level I trauma center and helicopter service in Mid-Missouri, and the only burn intensive care unit in the region. It also has an accredited chest pain center cardiology program and a multidisciplinary digestive disease program. The hospital is affiliated with the University of Missouri and the University of Missouri School of Medicine. History University Hospital is the 3rd hospital owned and operated by the University of Missouri. Parker Memorial Hospital, built in 1901, was a 45-bed facility that served as the original clinical home for the University's medical and nursing programs. In 1906, it was decided that the hospital needed to be upgraded and a new 75-bed facility was opened in 1923, bringing the total bed number to 120. Both Parker Memorial Hospital and Noyes Hospital still serve the University Hospital as Parker and Noyes Halls, respectively.Parker Memorial Hospital, 1901. After 10 years of political debate, it was decided that the University of Missouri needed a new hospital facility that would be located in Columbia. At least $13.5 million was appropriated for construction and the 7-floor structure was designed as a 441-bed, 28-bassinet, outpatient and emergency care facility, which was completed in 1956. The Medical Sciences Building and McHaney Hall, the nurse dormitory, were connected to the structure to make up the University of Missouri Hospital. Constructed in the mid-1960s, the Harry S. Truman Veterans Administration Hospital, located south of the Medical Center, shares medical staff with the hospital. Also constructed in the mid-1960s was the Mid- Missouri Mental Health Center. Although it originally separate from the hospital, both this facility and the Medical Center shared many functions and helped to reduce costs due to duplication of effort. University Hospital now owns and operates the mental health center, now named the Missouri Psychiatric Center. In 1976, the hospital and clinics were administratively separated from the UM Medical School control and became officially known as University Hospital and Clinics. In 1979, a new building was constructed for the School of Nursing. University Hospital and Clinics The parent organization of University Hospital, University of Missouri Healthcare, struggled financially for several years and lost nearly $40 million between fiscal years 2000 and 2002. In 2001, hospital officials embarked on a plan to attack the deficit by laying off some employees, improving billing procedures and realigning some hospital services. In 2002, the university system hired a private medical management firm, The Hunter Group, which created a turnaround based on management and accountability practice changes. Hunter Management also recruited nearly 50 new faculty members. In 2003, MU HealthCare reported more than $8 million in profits, and Hunter Management handed control back to MU in spring 2004. In fiscal years 2006 and 2007, the system continued its financial turnaround by posting combined earnings of $72.7 million. In 2009, ground was broken for a new $203 million patient care tower to be located north of the hospital main entrance. The 8-story patient care tower was expected to house the Ellis Fischel State Cancer Center, room for up to 12 additional operating rooms and 51 pre-and post-operation recovery rooms, and 90 private patient rooms. The addition was completed in 2013 and is home to the oncology unit, orthopaedics unit, neurosciences intensive care unit, and the progressive care unit (formerly known as step-down unit).Hospital business keeps on showing pattern of growth Trauma and emergency care The Frank L. Mitchell Jr., M.D., Trauma Center at the University Hospital is designated a Level I trauma center by the state of Missouri and is one of only three Level I trauma centers in Missouri verified by the Committee on Trauma of the American College of Surgeons.

Educational affiliates =Sinclair School of Nursing= Even though the School of Nursing was not an established part of the University of Missouri School of Medicine until 1920, MU graduated its first class of nurses in 1904. Those first few graduated from Parker Memorial Hospital Training School for Nurses with a 3-year degree in nursing. In 1973, the school became an autonomous division; additionally, construction on the School of Nursing building was begun in 1978, with the building being occupied in 1979. The School changed its name to the Sinclair School of Nursings after an endowment made by Charles and Josie Smith Sinclair in 1994. Affiliated with the Sinclair School of Nursing are the Tiger Place, a retirement home that is a joint venture between the School of Nursing and Americare; MU Sinclair Home Care, a home care arm of the School that was purchased in 2009 by Oxfard Healthcare; and the MU Interdisciplinary Center on Aging, which combines all three health science schools in an effort to enhance the quality of health care for older adults. MU School of Medicine The University of Missouri School of Medicine was the first publicly supported medical school west of the Mississippi River. Created as the Medical School of the University of the State of Missouri in 1873, Parker Memorial Hospital was the clinical site for studies when it was built in 1901. Today, the MU School of Medicine operates out of University Hospital and Clinics and is a primary provider of training for all physicians in Missouri. The School of Medicine's more than 650 faculty physicians and scientists educate approximately 1,000 medical students, residents, fellows and other students seeking advanced degrees. Prospective students compete for 104 first-year slots. The School uses a problem-based learning style, which emphasizes self-directed learning and early clinical experience.

Macomber Vocational Technical High School was a vocational public high school in Toledo, Ohio, USA, from 1938 to June 1991. It was named for the man who helped develop the city's schools and parks, and who used to live on the property the school was built on. Macomber served the entire city and was part of the Toledo Public School District. The school began as Vocational High School in the original Toledo high school in 19271936-37 Vocational HS yearbook before moving to its location on Monroe Street in 1938.1937-38 Vocational HS yearbook In 1959 the school became joint-operational with Whitney High School, an all-girls vocational school located just across 16th St., and the two buildings came to be known as Macomber-Whitney. The building still sits on Monroe Street, just northwest of Fifth Third Field. The Macomber Macmen/Craftsmen were members of the Toledo City League and donned the colors of black and gold. Their main rivals were the Scott Bulldogs, which was especially heated in their basketball match-ups. Macomber's lone team state title came in 1989, when their boys' basketball team won the Division I state championship. A \\"unique\\" situation for Macomber was that they were only able to have true home games for basketball and volleyball. Lacking a football stadium, ball diamonds, and a track, the Macmen made use of neighboring schools for \\"home\\" events, notably at Bowsher, Central Catholic, DeVilbiss, and Waite. During the 1980s when the boys basketball team had its greatest success, their home games were moved to other fieldhouses in order to accommodate the large crowds that turned out for their games. Due to a declining enrollment and low finances, Macomber and Whitney were closed along with DeVilbiss High School by TPS at the end of the 1990-1991 school year. The school was spared after an attempt to shutter its doors in 1989 and had its freshman class eliminated during its last year in operation. Macomber remained empty until 1998 when TPS sold the building for $425,000 to an industrial roofing company. After changing ownership a few times and finding a few other purposes for use, the building was purchased by the Cherry Street Mission in 2013 to help them have a centralized location for their ministry efforts to the homeless. In early 2014, TPS superintendent Romules Durant proposed re- opening Macomber-Whitney (likely at another location due to Cherry Street Mission's purchase of the building) so that Toledo could have a centralized vocational high school again.

Career Born in Brompton-by-Sawdon, Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, Tyson enjoyed a successful career as a left- handed batsman in League cricket in Yorkshire, and made his debut for Yorkshire at the age of 32, against Hampshire at County Cricket Ground, Southampton, in May 1921. He scored an unbeaten century and 80 not out against a strong bowling side, and followed this with 29 against the touring Australians, and an appearance in the Bradford hosted Roses Match, but difficulties over employment terms stopped him from playing again, and he returned to league cricket with Castleford C.C. Tyson was still eager to play in county cricket, so in 1926 he agreed to having a trial with Glamorgan and began a qualification period playing for Gowerton C.C. He continued to score heavily in the Leagues and made his debut for the Welsh county in their match against the Australians at the St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground in Swansea. He also scored a composed 79 in the county's friendly with H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI at Cardiff Arms Park, but this proved to be his final game at first-class level. After Glamorgan failed to offer a good enough contract, he again returned to the more lucrative league cricket scene in Northern England. He played only five games of first-class cricket, scoring 320 runs at 45.71. He bowled 15 overs of left arm medium pace, conceding 32 runs without taking a wicket.

Many of these same techniques can be classified as logical fallacies, since propagandists use arguments that, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.  General character  = Definition = Garth S. Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell define Propaganda as the \\"deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist. Harold D. Laswell's definition targets even more precisely the technical aspect: > \\"Propaganda in the broadest sense is the technique of influencing human > action by the manipulation of representations. These representations may > take spoken, written, pictorial or musical form.\\"Lasswell, Harold Dwight > (1937): Propaganda Technique in the World War. , S. 214–222. Manipulation can be organized or unorganized, conscious or unconscious, politically or socially motivated. The concept reaches from systematic state propaganda to manipulate public opinion (Edward Bernays) to \\"sociological propaganda\\" (propaganda of integration), where the unconscious desire to be manipulated and self manipulation leads the individual to adapt to the socially expected thoughts and behaviours (Jacques Ellul). The transition from non-propaganda to propaganda is fluid. Effective manipulation presupposes non- manipulative embedding in order to unfold its effect, which is why the reference to these contexts is not yet a refutation of the manipulative character of an act of communication. = Classification = Propaganda is understood as a form of manipulation of public opinion. The semiotic manipulation of signs is the essential characteristic (\\"Propaganda is a major form of manipulation by symbols\\" ). Thus, propaganda is a special form of communication, which is studied in communication research, and especially in media impact research, focusing on media manipulation. Propaganda is a particular type of communication characterized by distorting the representation of reality. = Manipulation and media = Common media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports, government reports, historical revision, junk science, books, leaflets, movies, social media, radio, television, and posters. Less common nowadays are the cow post envelopes, examples of which have survived from the time of the American Civil War. (Connecticut Historical Society; Civil War Collections; Covers.) In the case of radio and television, propaganda can exist on news, current-affairs or talk-show segments, as advertising or public-service announcement \\"spots\\" or as long-running advertorials. Propaganda campaigns often follow a strategic transmission pattern to indoctrinate the target group. This may begin with a simple transmission such as a leaflet dropped from a plane or an advertisement. Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information, via a web site, hot line, radio program, etc. The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement, and then from information seeker to opinion leader through indoctrination.Garth S. Jowett and Victoria J. O'Donnell, Propaganda & Persuasion (5th ed. 2011) Information dissemination strategies only become propaganda strategies when coupled with propagandistic messages. Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread. \\"Comrade Lenin Cleanses the Earth of Filth\\" by Viktor Deni. November 1920 Propaganda to urge immigrants to move to California, 1876 = Psychological aspects = Some techniques are categorized, analyzed and interpreted psychologically, within political psychology, especially mass psychology, social psychology, and cognitive psychology, which includes the study of cognitive distortions. With regard to political and military conflicts, propaganda is seen as part of psychological warfare and information warfare, which gain particular importance in the era of hybrid warfare and cyberwarfare. = Logic and rhetoric = Some techniques are classified as logical fallacies, because propaganda uses arguments which may have psychological effects but which are logically invalid. In rhetoric and dialectic, they are viewed as sophisms, ruses, and eristic stratagems.  Specific techniques  Scholars have identified many standard techniques used in propaganda and persuasion. ;Ad hominem :A Latin phrase that has come to mean attacking one's opponent, as opposed to attacking their arguments. ;Ad nauseam :This uses tireless repetition of an idea. An idea, especially a simple slogan, that is repeated enough times, may begin to be taken as the truth. This approach is more effective alongside the propagandist limiting or controlling the media. ;Agenda setting :Agenda setting means the \\"ability [of the news media] to influence the importance placed on the topics of the public agenda\\". If a news item is covered frequently and prominently, the audience will regard the issue as more important. ;Appeal to authority :Appeals to authority cite prominent figures to support a position, idea, argument, or course of action. ;Appeal to fear :Appeals to fear seek to build support by instilling anxieties and panic in the general population, for example, Joseph Goebbels exploited Theodore Kaufman's Germany Must Perish! to claim that the Allies sought the extermination of the German people. ;Appeal to prejudice :Using loaded or emotive terms to attach value or moral goodness to believing the proposition. ;Bandwagon :Bandwagon and \\"inevitable-victory\\" appeals attempt to persuade the target audience to join in and take the course of action that \\"everyone else is taking.\\" :*Inevitable victory: invites those not already on the bandwagon to join those already on the road to certain victory. Those already or at least partially on the bandwagon are reassured that staying aboard is their best course of action. (e.g., \\"The debate is over. Nearly everyone who matters agrees with me.\\") :*Join the crowd: This technique reinforces people's natural desire to be on the winning side. This technique is used to convince the audience that a program is an expression of an irresistible mass movement and that it is in their best interest to join. \\"Getting What He Deserves\\" American anti-Catholic cartoon from Heroes of the Fiery Cross 1928. ;Beautiful people :The type of propaganda that deals with famous people or depicts attractive, happy people. This suggests if people buy a product or follow a certain ideology, they too will be happy or successful. (This is used more in advertising for products, instead of political reasons.) Usually for advertising rather than political purposes, sexual arousal may also be used. For example, a message promoting a brand of motorcycles to a male target audience may also include sexually attractive bikini-clad women within the advertisement, to make the product more appealing to the audience by targeting sexual desires. However, some evidence suggests that using sexual appeal to sell a product may not succeed, as the target audience may focus too much on the sexually appealing people in the advertisement rather than the product itself. ;Big lie :The repeated articulation of a complex of events that justify subsequent action. The descriptions of these events have elements of truth, and the \\"big lie\\" generalizations merge and eventually supplant the public's accurate perception of the underlying events. After World War I the German stab in the back explanation of the cause of their defeat became a justification for Nazi re-militarization and revanchism. ;Black-and-white fallacy :Presenting only two choices, with the product or idea being propagated as the better choice. (e.g., \\"You're either with us, or against us....\\") ;Cherry picking : Richard Crossman, the British Deputy Director of Psychological Warfare Division (PWD) for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) during the Second World War said \\"In propaganda truth pays... It is a complete delusion to think of the brilliant propagandist as being a professional liar. The brilliant propagandist is the man who tells the truth, or that selection of the truth which is requisite for his purpose, and tells it in such a way that the recipient does not think he is receiving any propaganda... [...] The art of propaganda is not telling lies, but rather selecting the truth you require and giving it mixed up with some truths the audience wants to hear.\\" ;Classical conditioning :All vertebrates, including humans, respond to classical conditioning. That is, if A is always present when B is present and B causes a physical reaction (e.g. disgust, pleasure), then when presented with object A in the absence of B, that same reaction will be experienced. ;Cognitive dissonance :People desire to be consistent. Suppose a pollster finds that a certain group of people hates his candidate for senator but loves actor A. They use actor A's endorsement of their candidate to change people's minds because people cannot tolerate inconsistency. They are forced to either dislike the actor or like the candidate. ;Common man :The \\"plain folks\\" or \\"common man\\" approach attempts to convince the audience that the propagandist's positions reflect the common sense of the people. It is designed to win the confidence of the audience by communicating in the common manner and style of the target audience. Propagandists use ordinary language and mannerisms (and clothe their message in face-to-face and audiovisual communications) in attempting to identify their point of view with that of the average person. A common example of this type of propaganda is a political figure, usually running for a placement, in a backyard or shop doing daily routine things. This image appeals to the common person. With the plain folks device, the propagandist can win the confidence of persons who resent or distrust foreign sounding, intellectual speech, words, or mannerisms.\\" For example, a politician speaking to a Southern United States crowd might incorporate words such as \\"Y'all\\" and other colloquialisms to create a perception of belonging. ;Cult of personality :A cult of personality arises when an individual uses mass media to create an idealized and heroic public image, often through unquestioning flattery and praise. The hero personality then advocates the positions that the propagandist desires to promote. For example, modern propagandists hire popular personalities to promote their ideas and/or products. ;Demonizing the enemy :Making individuals from the opposing nation, from a different ethnic group, or those who support the opposing viewpoint appear to be subhuman (e.g., the Vietnam War-era term \\"gooks\\" for National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam aka Vietcong, or \\"VC\\", soldiers), worthless, or immoral, through suggestion or false accusations. Dehumanizing is also a term used synonymously with demonizing, the latter usually serves as an aspect of the former. World War I poster by Winsor McCay, urging Americans to buy Liberty Bonds ;Demoralization :Propaganda towards an adversary to erode fighting spirit, and encourage surrender or defection. ;Dictat :This technique hopes to simplify the decision making process by using images and words to tell the audience exactly what actions to take, eliminating any other possible choices. Authority figures can be used to give the order, overlapping it with the appeal to authority technique, but not necessarily. The Uncle Sam \\"I want you\\" image is an example of this technique. ;Disinformation :The creation or deletion of information from public records, in the purpose of making a false record of an event or the actions of a person or organization, including outright forgery of photographs, motion pictures, broadcasts, and sound recordings as well as printed documents. ;Divide and rule :Divide and rule in politics and sociology is gaining and maintaining power by breaking up larger concentrations of power into pieces that individually have less power than the one implementing the strategy. ;Door-in-the-face technique :Is used to increase a person's latitude of acceptance. For example, if a salesperson wants to sell an item for $100 but the public is only willing to pay $50, the salesperson first offers the item at a higher price (e.g., $200) and subsequently reduces the price to $100 to make it seem like a good deal. ;Dysphemism : A dysphemism is an expression with a negative connotation. It is the opposite of a euphemism. ;Euphemism :A euphemism is a generally innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found offensive or suggest something unpleasant. ;Euphoria :The use of an event that generates euphoria or happiness, or using an appealing event to boost morale. Euphoria can be created by declaring a holiday, making luxury items available, or mounting a military parade with marching bands and patriotic messages. ;Exaggeration :An exaggeration (or hyperbole) occurs when the most fundamental aspects of a statement are true, but only to a certain degree. It is also seen as \\"stretching the truth\\" or making something appear more powerful, meaningful, or real than it actually is. Saying that a person ate 20 spring rolls at a party when they actually ate 7 or 8 would be considered an exaggeration. ;False accusations :False accusations can be in any of the following contexts: informally in everyday life, quasi-judicially, or judicially. ;Fear, uncertainty, and doubt :Sometimes abbreviated as FUD, an attempt to influence public perception by disseminating negative and dubious/false information designed to undermine the credibility of their beliefs. ;Firehose of falsehood :A propaganda technique in which a large number of messages are broadcast rapidly, repetitively, and continuously over multiple channels (such as news and social media) without regard for truth or consistency. ;Flag-waving :An attempt to justify an action on the grounds that doing so will make one more patriotic, or in some way benefit a group, country, or idea. The feeling of patriotism this technique attempts to inspire may not necessarily diminish or entirely omit one's capability for rational examination of the matter in question. The Finnish Maiden - personification of Finnish nationalism ;Foot-in-the-door technique :Often used by recruiters and salesmen. For example, the perpetrator walks up to the victim and pins a flower or gives a small gift to the victim. The victim says thanks and now they have incurred a psychological debt to the perpetrator. The person eventually asks for a larger favor (e.g., a donation or to buy something far more expensive). The unwritten social contract between the victim and perpetrator causes the victim to feel obligated to reciprocate by agreeing to do the larger favor or buy the more expensive gift. ;Framing (social sciences) : Framing is the social construction of a social phenomenon often by mass media sources, political or social movements, political leaders, or other actors and organizations. It is an inevitable process of selective influence over the individual's perception of the meanings attributed to words or phrases. ;Gaslighting :Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying to sow seeds of doubt in a target individual or group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, sanity, and norms. ;Gish gallop :Bombarding a political opponent with obnoxiously complex questions in rapid fire during a debate to make the opponent appear to not know what they are talking about. ;Glittering generalities :Glittering generalities are emotionally appealing words that are applied to a product or idea, but present no concrete argument or analysis. This technique has also been referred to as the PT Barnum effect. (e.g., the advertising campaign slogan \\"Ford has a better idea!\\") ;Guilt by association or Reductio ad Hitlerum :This technique is used to persuade a target audience to disapprove of an action or idea by suggesting that the idea is popular with groups hated, feared, or held in contempt by the target audience. Thus if a group that supports a certain policy is led to believe that undesirable, subversive, or contemptible people support the same policy, then the members of the group may decide to change their original position. This is a form of bad logic, where A is said to include X, and B is said to include X, therefore, A = B. ;Half-truth :A half- truth is a deceptive statement that includes some element of truth. It comes in several forms: the statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth, or it may utilize some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation, or double meaning, especially if the intent is to deceive, evade, blame, or misrepresent the truth. ;Information overload :\\"Information overload can have the same effect as secrecy and certainly in the short term and for democracies today it might be considered more effective.\\" \\"When information overload occurs, it is likely that a reduction in decision quality will occur.\\" \\"The glut of information generated by modern technology [...] threatens to make its receivers passive. Overload prompts disengagement.\\" ;Intentional vagueness :Generalities are deliberately vague so that the audience may supply its own interpretations. The intention is to move the audience by use of undefined phrases, without analyzing their validity or attempting to determine their reasonableness or application. The intent is to cause people to draw their own interpretations rather than simply being presented with an explicit idea. In trying to \\"figure out\\" the propaganda, the audience forgoes judgment of the ideas presented. Their validity, reasonableness and application may still be considered. ;Labeling :A euphemism is used when the propagandist attempts to increase the perceived quality, credibility, or credence of a particular ideal. A dysphemism is used when the intent of the propagandist is to discredit, diminish the perceived quality, or hurt the perceived righteousness of the individual. By creating a \\"label\\", \\"category\\", or \\"faction\\" of a population, it is much easier to make an example of these larger bodies, because they can uplift or defame the individual without actually incurring legal-defamation. Labeling can be thought of as a sub-set of guilt by association, another logical fallacy.A Citizens Guide to Understanding Corporate Media Propaganda Techniques ;Latitudes of acceptance :If a person's message is outside the bounds of acceptance for an individual and group, most techniques will engender psychological reactance (simply hearing the argument will make the message even less acceptable). There are two techniques for increasing the bounds of acceptance. First, one can take an even more extreme position that will make more moderate positions seem more acceptable. This is similar to the door-in-the-face technique. Alternatively, one can moderate one's own position to the edge of the latitude of acceptance and then over time slowly move to the position that was previously held.unacceptable message \\"The Conquest or Arrival of Hernán Cortés in Veracruz\\", 1951, National Palace, Mexico City. Diego Rivera's political murals depict a modern interpretation of the Black Legend. ;Loaded language :Specific words and phrases with strong emotional implications are used to influence the audience, for example, using the word reforms rather than a more neutral word like changes. ;Love bombing :Used to recruit members to a cult or ideology by having a group of individuals cut off a person from their existing social support and replace it entirely with members of the group who deliberately bombard the person with affection in an attempt to isolate the person from their prior beliefs and value system. ;Lying and deception :Lying and deception can be the basis of many propaganda techniques including Ad Hominem arguments, Big-Lie, Defamation, Door-in-the- Face, Half-truth, Name-calling or any other technique that is based on dishonesty or deception. For example, many politicians have been found to frequently stretch or break the truth. ;Managing the news :According to Adolf Hitler, \\"The most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly – it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over.\\" This idea is consistent with the principle of classical conditioning as well as the idea of \\"Staying on Message.\\" Anti-Muslim propaganda in Germany produced during the Ottoman wars in Europe, 16th century ;Milieu control :An attempt to control the social environment and ideas through the use of social pressure ;Minimisation :Minimisation is the opposite of exaggeration. It is a type of deceptionGuerrero, L., Anderson, P., Afifi, W. (2007). Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships (2nd ed.). Los Angeles: Sage Publications. involving denial coupled with rationalization in situations where complete denial is implausible. ;Name-calling :Propagandists use the name-calling technique to incite fears and arouse prejudices in their hearers in the intent that the bad names will cause hearers to construct a negative opinion about a group or set of beliefs or ideas that the propagandist wants hearers to denounce. The method is intended to provoke conclusions about a matter apart from impartial examinations of facts. Name-calling is thus a substitute for rational, fact-based arguments against an idea or belief on its own merits. Graham's hierarchy of disagreement. ;Non sequitur :A type of logical fallacy, in which a conclusion is made out of an argument that does not justify it. All invalid arguments can be considered as special cases of non sequitur. ;Obfuscation, intentional vagueness, confusion :Generalities are deliberately vague so that the audience may supply its own interpretations. The intention is to move the audience by use of undefined phrases, without analyzing their validity or attempting to determine their reasonableness or application. The intent is to cause people to draw their own interpretations rather than simply being presented with an explicit idea. In trying to \\"figure out\\" the propaganda, the audience forgoes judgment of the ideas presented. Their validity, reasonableness and application may still be considered. ;Operant conditioning :Operant conditioning involves learning through imitation. For example, watching an appealing person buy products or endorse positions teaches a person to buy the product or endorse the position. Operant conditioning is the underlying principle behind the ad nauseam, slogan and other repetition public relations campaigns. ;Oversimplification :Favorable generalities are used to provide simple answers to complex social, political, economic, or military problems. Illustration by Rev. Branford Clarke from Heroes of the Fiery Cross by Bishop Alma White published by the Pillar of Fire Church 1928 in Zarephath, NJ ;Pensée unique :Enforced reduction of discussion by use of overly simplistic phrases or arguments (e.g., \\"There is no alternative to war.\\") ;Quotes out of context :Selective editing of quotes that can change meanings. Political documentaries designed to discredit an opponent or an opposing political viewpoint often use this technique. ;Rationalization :Individuals or groups may use favorable generalities to rationalize questionable acts or beliefs. Vague and pleasant phrases are often used to justify such actions or beliefs. ;Red herring :Presenting data or issues that, while compelling, are irrelevant to the argument at hand, and then claiming that it validates the argument. In 1807, William Cobbett wrote how he used red herrings to lay a false trail, while training hunting dogs—an apocryphal story that was probably the origin of the idiom. ;Repetition : This is the repeating of a certain symbol or slogan so that the audience remembers it. This could be in the form of a jingle or an image placed on nearly everything in the picture/scene. This also includes using subliminal phrases, images or other content in a piece of propaganda. ;Scapegoating :Assigning blame to an individual or group, thus alleviating feelings of guilt from responsible parties and/or distracting attention from the need to fix the problem for which blame is being assigned. Nationalist slogan \\"Brazil, love it or leave it\\", often used during the Brazilian military dictatorship (1964–1985) ;Slogans :A slogan is a brief, striking phrase that may include labeling and stereotyping. Although slogans may be enlisted to support reasoned ideas, in practice they tend to act only as emotional appeals. Opponents of the US's invasion and occupation of Iraq use the slogan \\"blood for oil\\" to suggest that the invasion and its human losses was done to access Iraq's oil riches. On the other hand, supporters who argue that the US should continue to fight in Iraq use the slogan \\"cut and run\\" to suggest withdrawal is cowardly or weak. Similarly, the names of the military campaigns, such as \\"enduring freedom\\" or \\"just cause\\" can also be considered slogans, devised to influence people. ;Smears :A smear is an effort to damage or call into question someone's reputation, by propounding negative propaganda. It can be applied to individuals or groups. ;Stereotyping, name calling or labeling :This technique attempts to arouse prejudices in an audience by labeling the object of the propaganda campaign as something the target audience fears, hates, loathes, or finds undesirable. For instance, reporting on a foreign country or social group may focus on the stereotypical traits that the reader expects, even though they are far from being representative of the whole country or group; such reporting often focuses on the anecdotal. In graphic propaganda, including war posters, this might include portraying enemies with stereotyped racial features. ;Straw man :A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position. To \\"attack a straw man\\" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar proposition (the \\"straw man\\"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position. ;Testimonial :Testimonials are quotations, in or out of context, especially cited to support or reject a given policy, action, program, or personality. The reputation or the role (expert, respected public figure, etc.) of the individual giving the statement is exploited. The testimonial places the official sanction of a respected person or authority on a propaganda message. This is done in an effort to cause the target audience to identify itself with the authority or to accept the authority's opinions and beliefs as its own. \\"The Bulgarian Martyresses\\", 1877 painting by the Russian painter Konstantin Makovsky depicting the rape of Bulgarian women by Ottoman troops during the suppression of the April Uprising a year earlier, served to mobilize public support for the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) waged with the proclaimed aim of liberating the Bulgarians. ;Third party technique :Works on the principle that people are more willing to accept an argument from a seemingly independent source of information than from someone with a stake in the outcome. It is a marketing strategy commonly employed by Public Relations (PR) firms, that involves placing a premeditated message in the \\"mouth of the media.\\" The third party technique can take many forms, ranging from the hiring of journalists to report the organization in a favorable light, to using scientists within the organization to present their perhaps prejudicial findings to the public. Frequently, astroturf groups or front groups are used to deliver the message. ;Thought-terminating cliché :A commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell cognitive dissonance. ;Transfer :Also known as association, this is a technique of projecting positive or negative qualities (praise or blame) of a person, entity, object, or value onto another to make the second more acceptable or to discredit it. It evokes an emotional response, which stimulates the target to identify with recognized authorities. Often highly visual, this technique often utilizes symbols (for example, the swastikas used in Nazi Germany, originally a symbol for health and prosperity) superimposed over other visual images. ;Unstated assumption :This technique is used when the propaganda concept would seem less credible if explicitly stated. The concept is instead repeatedly assumed or implied. ;Virtue words :These are words in the value system of the target audience that produce a positive image when attached to a person or issue. Peace, hope, happiness, security, wise leadership, freedom, \\"The Truth\\", etc. are virtue words. Many see religiosity as a virtue, making associations to this quality effectively beneficial. ;Whataboutism :Whataboutism is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union, the Soviet response would be \\"What about...\\" followed by an event in the Western world.

Established in 1912, it continues today as Hollywood's largest independent studio and an active facility for television and film production on its twelve soundstages. History The studios were founded by Columbia Pictures Studios movie mogul Harry Cohn in 1918 in the Poverty Row area of Hollywood. Poverty Row was the area bounded by Sunset Boulevard on the North, Gower Street on the West, and Beachwood Drive on the East. Poverty Row was a collection of small warehouses and offices where independent film makers gathered to buy \\"short ends\\" of film from the major studios, in order to create their \\"great American dreams\\". On January 10, 1924, Columbia Pictures Corporation was born. By 1929, the familiar image of the lady with the torch was beginning to make an impact on the Hollywood scene. The Sunset Gower Studios lot, the home of such Columbia classics as Frank Capra's It Happened One Night in 1934, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington in 1939, the Three Stooges shorts, Funny Girl and The Caine Mutiny, has continued to host productions of top new films such as The Good Shepherd and The Good German. Television programs which have occupied several sound stages most notably include current series Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder and ended series Heroes, Dexter, NewsRadio, The Amanda Show, Deal or No Deal, Saved by the Bell, Hip Hop Harry, City Guys, Six Feet Under, JAG, Married... with Children, Soap, That's So Raven, Moesha, The Parkers, The Donna Reed Show, Father Knows Best, I Dream of Jeannie (which also used the \\"Father Knows Best\\" exterior house and \\"Donna Reed Show\\" interior living room), Bewitched, The Monkees, the first two seasons of The Golden Girls, the final three seasons of The Facts of Life, and the final two seasons of Silver Spoons. Harry Cohn died in 1958 at the age of 66. His memorial service was held on stages 12 and 14 at the studios (there is no stage 13). Without the guidance of the Cohn Brothers, Columbia Pictures Corporation was not the profit-making company it once was. Between 1970 and 1972, Columbia moved from the lot, and joined forces with Warner Bros. in Burbank. Its “back lot” on which all the great Columbia westerns were made on Hollywood Way in Burbank became the property of Warner Bros. Columbia Pictures Corporation, renamed \\"Columbia Pictures Industries, Incorporated\\" after merging with its television subsidiary Screen Gems (now Sony Pictures Television) in 1968, became a film entity without real estate. A large list of successful films were produced during this time, and in 1982, Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. was sold to The Coca-Cola Company for $750 million.\\"Coke Completes Columbia Merger\\". The New York Times. June 23, 1982. Retrieved March 14, 2010. The lot, in the meantime, sat fallow. In 1977 the property was purchased by the Pick Vanoff Company for $6.2 million. The name was changed to \\"Sunset Gower Studios\\" and the lot became a rental facility for independent film companies. It was also used in the seventies as a music rehearsal facility catering to such music greats as Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, The Eagles, Led Zeppelin, Ringo Starr, Frank Zappa, and Olivia Newton-John. For a time stages 12 and 14 became indoor tennis courts. In November 2004, Sunset Gower Studios was purchased by GI Partners for an estimated $105 million, and in 2006 began construction on a six-story building for Technicolor SA. In August 2007, Sunset Gower Studios was bought by Hudson Capital. The Technicolor building opened its doors in 2008. Since 2007, the studio has been undergoing both interior and exterior improvements on the lot. Sunset Gower Studios is now working closely with its sister company Sunset Bronson Studios, located just a couple of blocks west on the site of the original Warner Bros. lot (1923-37), formerly owned by Tribune Broadcasting, and Sunset Las Palmas Studios, formerly Hollywood Center Studios until 2017.

Ride experience The ride started with a launch from the inside of the NASCAR Cafe accelerating from in two seconds. The train dropped into an underground tunnel in front of the resort and then passed through a vertical loop. Afterwards a second launch accelerated the train from in three seconds. After a quick snaking turn the train climbed a huge vertical tower before the train fell back and ran through the entire course backwards. On the return trip the second launch area decelerated the train from before it traveled back through the vertical loop and through the underground tunnel. The train then returned to the station with a complete stop. It was also considered one of the tallest and the longest shuttle coasters in the world.

It is a work of his maturity, probably dating from the period after he returned to Condé-sur-l'Escaut in 1504. It is one of Josquin's only masses not to be based on pre-existing material, and like the Missa ad fugam, it is a canonic mass.Bloxham, in Scherr, p. 204 The circumstances of its composition are unknown. Since its first appearance was in Ottaviano Petrucci's third book of Josquin's masses (Fossombrone, 1514), and since it then also appeared in later manuscript copies, it is presumed that it was relatively recently composed at the time of publication; in addition stylistic characteristics suggest it was a late work.Planchart, in Scherr, p. 120 Josquin wrote only two canonic masses, the Missa ad fugam and the Missa sine nomine; they seem to stand at opposite ends of his career, and in the latter work he seemed to revisit some of the compositional problems he tackled in his early work in order to solve them a different way.Bloxham, in Scherr, p. 209 As in most musical settings of the mass Ordinary, it is in five parts: # Kyrie # Gloria # Credo # Sanctus # Agnus Dei The melodic material on which the mass is based, \\"Sine nomine\\" (without a name), is either freely composed or from a source which has not been identified. All voices take part in the numerous canons, and the texture is often fully imitative.Noble, Grove online, 12 The movements generally become fuller in texture with faster note values as they progress, giving each a dramatic curve, and several end with ostinato patterns.Bloxham, in Scherr, p. 207 The work is likely a tribute to Johannes Ockeghem, who may have been Josquin's teacher or mentor, according to the testimony of several 16th century writers as well as internal evidence in many of Josquin's compositions. Not only is the mass indebted to Ockeghem through its use of elaborate canonic techniques, its modal ambiguity, and its avoidance of head-motifs to unify sections, but it directly quotes the lament Josquin wrote on Ockeghem's death – Nymphes des bois – in the et incarnatus section of the Credo, a part of the mass that Josquin often reserved for his most striking textural contrasts or effects.Bloxham, in Scherr, p. 205, 208 The unconstrained compositional methods that Josquin employed in writing this mass foreshadowed what was probably his next work, the Missa Pange lingua, which was an extended fantasy on a plainsong, and which was probably his last mass.Planchart, in Scherr, p. 132 References * Jeremy Noble: \\"Josquin des Prez\\", 12, Grove Music Online, ed.

The Outsiders recorded for Capitol Records, turning out four Top 40 hits: \\"Time Won't Let Me\\", \\"Respectable (What Kind of Girl Is This)\\", \\"Girl in Love\\", and \\"Help Me Girl\\", which was arranged by Chuck Mangione. Geraci's biggest hit song was \\"Precious and Few\\" (first released as a single on July 16, 1971) as lead vocalist for Climax, which reached #3 on the Billboard charts. Climax released their debut album, \\"Climax featuring Sonny Geraci\\", in 1972. Despite the success of the single, Geraci never released another album with Climax and the group disbanded in 1975. A second album of material was almost completed but never released. In 1983, Geraci assumed the pseudonym Peter Emmett for an MCA project called \\"The Peter Emmett Story\\". Intended as a comeback vehicle for Geraci, he was backed in the studio by Donnie Iris's band, The Cruisers. A band called North Coast, pictured on the album sleeve, was put together after the recording had been made with The Cruisers. The band played shows in the Cleveland/Akron area before disbanding a few years later. In 2002, he filled in for his friend Rob Grill as lead vocalist for The Grass Roots and became an honorary member of the band. After 25 years away from the music industry, Geraci started to perform again and in 2007 toured under the name \\"Sonny Geraci and The Outsiders\\". In April 2012, Geraci suffered a brain aneurysm (specifically, a cerebral arteriovenous malformation), requiring intensive care. From November 15–16, 2013, a benefit concert for Geraci was held at the Z-Plex at Stringz 'N Wingz in Streetsboro, Ohio.

It was renowned for inflicting heavy casualties on the opposing forces of the Ottoman Empire, particularly at the Battle of Sarikamish. It was also known for its extremely diverse ethnic composition, consisting of units from throughout the Russian Empire and both soldiers and officers from the many ethnic communities settled since the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War in the militarily administered Kars Oblast in the Russian Transcaucasus. These included Georgians, Caucasus Greeks, and Armenians - the latter in particular strongly represented among both the soldiers and senior officers - as well as ethnic Russians and Ukrainians. Period of existence The Caucasus Army was formed in July 1914 from units of the Caucasus Military District. It ceased to exist in April 1917 when it was reorganized as the Caucasus Front, although this Front contained many of the same units and continued fighting in the same theater. This Front in turn formally ceased to exist in March 1918. It withdrew from Armenia that year.

Geelong 9.12 (66) defeated 5.10 (40) in the challenge Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the senior Grand Final on 20 October at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Notable events * New scoreboards are erected at each home ground by the VFL's publication, The Football Record. With the help of a key published in that Saturday afternoon's Record, spectators can decipher the coded quarter-by-quarter scores of the other three matches as they appear on these scoreboards throughout the afternoon. * After the round 13 match against Essendon at Windy Hill, at an after-match function in the Essendon rooms, Carlton rover George Bolt and backman Jack Morrissey (who had not played in that game) came to blows. The Carlton Committee met the next day and suspended both players indefinitely. Bolt never played for Carlton again (he reappeared with Hawthorn in 1925, then he played for North Melbourne in 1926 and 1927); Jack Morrissey played his next game for Carlton on 27 June 1925 (round 9). * The 1922 Victorian Interstate team captain, and Carlton star ruckman, Bert Boromeo was overheard being intensely critical of the Carlton captain-coach Horrie Clover at the same function. The Carlton Committee was upset at such behaviour occurring on the premises of another club, and suspended Boromeo immediately; eventually, in 1926, Carlton cleared Boromeo to Richmond for whom he played 14 games. * The Essendon Premiership team was known as the \\"Mosquito Fleet\\", due to the number of small, very fast players in the side. Six were 5'6\\" (167 cm) or less: Charlie Hardy 5'1\\" (155 cm), who played his first VFL game at the age of 34, George Shorten 5'5\\" (165 cm), Jack Garden 5'5\\" (165 cm), Frank Maher 5'6\\" (167.5 cm), Vince Irwin 5'6\\" (167.5 cm), and Jimmy Sullivan 5'6\\" (167.5 cm). * In Round 10 against St. Kilda, Essendon kicked the season's lowest score, but they still won the premiership. They became the first premier team to have also kicked the season's lowest score, an occurrence replicated in 1968, 1970, 1992 and 1995. * The Challenge Final match had to be postponed for a week as the Melbourne Cricket Ground was under water due to intense rain. This meant that the Challenge Final was played on Saturday 20 October 1923, Caulfield Cup Day.

After the war, he became the leader of the Mason Gang, a criminal gang of river pirates and highwaymen on the lower Ohio River and the Mississippi River in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was associated with outlaws around Red Banks, Cave-in-Rock, Stack Island, and the Natchez Trace. Early life Mason was born in Norfolk, Virginia, and raised in what is now Charles Town, West Virginia, formerly a part of Virginia. According to Lyman Draper, in the 1750s Mason got his earliest start in crime as a teenager, by stealing the horses of Colonel John L. Hite, in Frederick County, Virginia, being wounded and caught by his pursuers. He moved from Charles Town to what is now Ohio County, West Virginia, also at that time a part of Virginia, in 1773. American Revolutionary War service During the American Revolution, Samuel Mason was a captain, of the Ohio County Militia, Virginia State Forces. According to Ohio County court minutes, dated January 7, 1777, Mason was recommended to Patrick Henry, the Governor of Virginia, to serve as captain of the militia.Boyd Crumrine, Virginia Court Records in Southwestern Pennsylvania, Records of the District of West Augusta and Ohio and Yahogania Counties, Virginia, 1775–1780, Consolidated Edition, p. 366, dated 1981. On January 28, he was present and cited as a captain from Ohio county at a \\"council of war\\" held at Catfish Camp.History of the Upper Ohio Valley, Vol. 1., Brant & Fuller, p. 73, dated 1891. Catfish Camp was located at or near present-day Washington, Pennsylvania.Samuel Hazard, Pennsylvania Archives, Selected and Arranged from Original Documents in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Conformably to Acts of the General Assembly, February 15, 1851, & March 7, 1852, Vol. V., p. 445, dated 1853. On June 8, 1777, Mason wrote a letter from Fort Henry, Virginia, now present-day Wheeling, West Virginia, to brigadier general Edward Hand, at Fort Pitt, now present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The letter he wrote was signed Samuel Meason. On September 1, 1777, Captain Mason was wounded but survived an ambush by Native Americans, near Fort Henry. Most of the men in his Virginia Militia company perished during the attack.History of the Upper Ohio Valley, Vol. 1., Brant & Fuller, pps. 80–82, dated 1891. From August 11-September 14, 1779 Samuel Mason while at Fort Henry accompanied Colonel Daniel Brodhead and his 8th Pennsylvania Regiment of the Continental Army combined with militia troops from Fort Pitt to destroy ten tribal villages of the pro-British Seneca tribe in northeastern Pennsylvania during the Sullivan Expedition in retaliation for the devastating Iroquois attacks in the Cobleskill, Wyoming Valley and Cherry Valley massacres of 1778. According to court martial records in Ohio County, Virginia, Captain Mason was still on duty as an officer in the Ohio County, Virginia Militia at Fort Henry until 1781. He appeared at the court martials and was present as a witness for military proceedings against other soldiers. Samuel Mason appeared twice at the Ohio County courthouse in Wheeling on November 7, 1780 and May 7, 1781. Honest pursuits In his book, The Outlaws of Cave-In-Rock, Otto A. Rothert stated that Samuel Mason moved again, in 1779, to a part of Virginia, east of Wheeling that is now in present-day Washington County, Pennsylvania, where he was elected justice of the peace and later selected as an associate judge, leaving for an area that was then a part of Virginia and now the present-day State of Kentucky, in 1784. Mason's surname was spelled interchangeably as Meason in many of the early frontier records. This is explained in two family histories of the Mason/Meason family, Pioneer Period and Pioneer People of Fairfield County, Ohio by C. M. L. Wiseman, dated 1901, and Torrence and Allied Families by Robert M. Torrence, dated 1938. Criminal career In the early 1790s, Samuel Mason moved his family to the Red Banks on the Ohio River, now Henderson, Kentucky, where he began his full-time criminal activities. He later settled downriver on Diamond Island and engaged in river piracy. By 1797, Mason moved the base of his operations further downriver to Cave-in-Rock on the Illinois side of the river in the Northwest Territory. The Mason Gang of river pirates openly based themselves at the prominent Ohio River landmark known as Cave-in-Rock, a huge shelter cave. Samuel Mason had a brief association with the first known serial killers in America, Micajah and Wiley Harpe, as well as Peter Alston, and possibly John Duff, the counterfeiter. Mason and his gang stayed at Cave-In- Rock until the summer of 1799, when they were expelled by the \\"Exterminators\\", a group of regulators under the leadership of Captain Young of Mercer County, Kentucky. Samuel Mason moved his operations down the Mississippi River and settled his family in the territory of Spanish Louisiana, now the present-day state of Missouri, and became a highwayman along the Natchez Trace in Mississippi Territory, now the present-day state of Mississippi. It was on the Natchez Trace that Mason received his most infamous nickname. He would leave a message after each crime (often in the blood of his murdered victims) proudly stating, \\"Done by Mason of the Woods\\". In April 1802, Mississippi Territorial Governor William C. C. Claiborne was informed that Mason and Wiley Harpe had attempted to board the boat of a Colonel Joshua Baker between Yazoo, now Yazoo, Mississippi, and Walnut Hills, now Vicksburg, Mississippi. Physical appearance A man named Swaney, who saw Samuel Mason often, described his appearance: \\"He weighed about two hundred pounds, and was a fine looking man. He was rather modest and unassuming, and had nothing of the raw-head-and- bloody-bones appearance which his character would indicate\\". Another man, Henry Howe described Mason as: \\"...a man of gigantic stature and of more than ordinary talents\\". A William Darby also described him as follows: \\"Mason at any time of his life or in any situation, had something extremely ferocious in his look, which arose particularly from a tooth which projected forwards, and could only be covered with his lip by effort\\". Arrest, escape, and death According to Spanish colonial court records, Spanish government officials arrested Samuel Mason and his men, early in 1803, at the Little Prairie settlement, now Caruthersville, in southeastern Missouri. Mason and his gang, including his family members, were taken to the Spanish colonial government in New Madrid, Spanish Upper Louisiana Territory, along the Mississippi River, where a three-day hearing was held to determine whether Mason was truly involved in river piracy, as he had been formally accused of this crime. Although he claimed he was simply a farmer, who had been maligned by his enemies, the peculiar presence of $7,000 in currency and twenty human scalps found in his baggage was the damning evidence that convinced the Spanish he indeed was a river pirate. Mason and his family were taken, under armed guard, to New Orleans, the capital of Spanish Lower Louisiana Territory, where the Spanish colonial governor ordered them handed over to the American authorities in the Mississippi Territory, as all crimes they had been convicted of appeared to have taken place in American territory or against American river boats. While being transported up the Mississippi River, Samuel Mason and gang members John Sutton or Setton, one of the many aliases used by Wiley Harpe, and James May, alias of Peter Alston, overpowered their guards and escaped, with Mason being shot in the head during the escape. One of the 1803 accounts {Rothert. p. 247} claimed Captain Robert McCoy, the commandant of New Madrid, was killed by Mason during their escape. McCoy actually died in 1840, and was neither crippled nor killed by Mason.Houck's \\"History of Missouri from the Earliest explorations...\\" 1908 Volume 2. p. 140. According to Conrad's \\"Encyclopedia of the History of Missouri\\" 1901. p. 557 a Creek named Tewanaye who killed a David Trotter in New Madrid in 1802 had been found guilty of murder in New Orleans and in a return trip near Natchez in a galley Tewanaye had tried to escape and crippled McCoy; Tewanaye was executed in New Madrid January 3, 1803. American territorial governor William C. C. Claiborne immediately issued a reward for their recapture, prompting Wiley Harpe and Peter Alston to bring Mason's head, in an attempt to claim the reward money. Whether they killed Mason or whether he died from his wound suffered in the escape attempt has never been established. Setton and May were recognized and identified as wanted criminals, Wiley Harpe and Peter Alston, were arrested, tried in U.S. federal court, found guilty of piracy, and hanged in Old Greenville, Jefferson County, Mississippi Territory in early 1804.Wagner, Mark and Mary R.

C. Claiborne offered a $2,000 reward, a very large sum of money at the time, for the capture or severed head of Samuel Mason. Wiley Harpe and Peter Alston brought in the head of Mason to collect the reward and were identified and hanged. Similarities of Samuel Mason and the Mason Gang to other criminal gangs From the 1790s-1833, James Ford led a double life while living in Ford's Ferry, Kentucky, as the justice of the peace and the gang leader of a group of highwaymen and river pirates on the Ohio River. From 1863-1864, Henry Plummer was the elected sheriff of the gold rush town, Bannack, Montana, in the Idaho Territory. He was later accused of being the leader of an outlaw gang, the Innocents, who stole gold shipments from Bannick, and was hanged by Bannick vigilantes. In popular culture Walter Brennan (on the right) as Samuel Mason-like river pirate gang leader, Colonel Jeb Hawkins, and Lee Van Cleef in the 1962 film, How the West Was Won In the 1956 Walt Disney television series Davy Crockett and the River Pirates, a Hollywoodized version of Samuel Mason is portrayed by American actor Mort Mills, who appears alongside the Harpe brothers. In the 1962 John Ford Western epic film How the West Was Won, a Samuel Mason-like frontier outlaw leader of a gang of river pirates is portrayed by Walter Brennan, as the fictional character of Colonel Jeb Hawkins, which alludes to the historical Cave-In- Rock.

Latina examines the exploitation film genre through a revenge tale about a desperate C.I.A. agent on a mission to find the man who murdered his wife. The film stars Danny Trejo (Machete, Heat, Predators), Mark Borchardt (American Movie), Michael Sottile (Reservoir Dogs), and Randy Russell (American Job) as Agent Stanley Cashay. Modus Operandi was produced by Frankie Latina Motion Pictures, Special Entertainment and Reign Supreme Entertainment, and was distributed on DVD, Video On Demand, Netflix, and Redbox by Kino on February 14, 2012. Plot summary Two briefcases with mysterious contents are stolen from top Presidential candidate Squire Parks, setting off a deadly series of double- crosses and betrayals. Desperate warring factions of subterranean organizations will stop at nothing to gain possession of the sensitive material. A covert branch of the CIA calls on notorious Black Ops agent Stanley Cashay, who has been barely existing in a semi-comatose twilight since the murder of his wife. Cashay is offered the identity of his wife's killer in exchange for locating and returning the cases. Agent Cashay uses the most dangerous weapons at his command, the telephone and his reputation, to unleash a bizarre assortment of operatives, including the deliciously sleazy Casey Thunderbird and exotic Tokyo-based special agent Black Licorice. Along with scores of other beguiling rogues, they initiate a horrifying chain of events, including ruthless torture and brutal killings. When Cashay is finally in possession of the stolen materials, the contents of the briefcases shock even him, and he makes a decision that will change the course of history. Cashay then sets the wheels in motion for bitter revenge and harsh justice, but not before the entire operation is nearly derailed as merciless underworld forces fight back. The final chapters play out as an increasingly surreal vision of modern reality, skirting the edge of sanity and culminating with the wrath of the powerful Director Holiday, a man who would put the fear of God into God Himself. Critical reception Director Latina with Danny Trejo The film premiered at the CineVegas Film Festival in June 2009, where it received critical acclaim and obtained sales representation from Submarine Entertainment. Modus Operandi was an official entry in the American Film Institute Film Festival where it screened at the historic Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles in October 2009. The film played to sold-out audiences at the historic Landmark Oriental Theater during the Milwaukee Film Festival. The film started its theatrical run on September 10, 2010 at the IFC Center in New York City, with a pre-screening introduction from Sasha Grey and appearances by Danny Trejo and Mark Borchardt.; 2010-09-22. The film received generally positive reviews. As of January 14, 2011, the film holds a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a rating of 6.6 out of 10 on IMDb. Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a positive review and called it a \\"special pleasure\\". Mike Hale of the New York Times said \\"Frankie Latina’s Modus Operandi bears a greater surface resemblance to the 1960s and ’70s genre films to which it pays homage than Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez’s Grindhouse did.\\" Eric Hynes of the Village Voice called the film \\"seriously seedy and truly inspired\\", and Kyle Smith of the New York Post referred to the film as \\"Genius-level garbage\\".

Previously known under its work title A Dark Winter's Tale, this album breaks the band's habit of writing about historical characters and events. Instead, it tells a fictional, medieval-themed story written by Haggard's songwriter Asis Nasseri. The album includes a cover version of the song \\"Hijo de la Luna\\" (Child of the Moon), originally written by José María Cano and performed by his own band, Spanish Pop group Mecano. However, his authorship of the song is not acknowledged in the CD's booklet, instead being referred to as \\"Traditional\\" music and lyrics. The album was released on August 29, 2008. It peaked at positions 37 in the German Media Control Charts and 89 in the Swiss Music Charts. Track listing  Reception  Tales of Ithiria received favourable reviews from the critics. The German issue of Metal Hammer noted a perfect arrangement of instruments and vocalists but criticised the short net playtime of music on the album, which consists of frequent narrations between the tracks. The Dutch Lords of Metal webzine lauded the connection of classical music and extreme Metal and the transfer of the storyline into music. The German MetalGlory ezine highlighted the multiple voice parts of male grunts and classical male and female voices but criticised the short total time as well. The German Sonic Seducer magazine was critical though of the grunts which according to their review contrast the otherwise subtle mood of the songs. Sonic Seducer however lauded the work of drummer Mike Terrana as narrator and also the arrangement of the cover version of \\"Hijo de la Luna\\".

Looney Tunes short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on April 28, 1956, and stars Bugs Bunny. The name and part of the story is a direct parody of Robinson Crusoe. Plot Yosemite Sam has been shipwrecked on a small island for 20 years, and with the ship's supplies used up, the only food source is a coconut tree on an adjacent island. Crossing between the islands, however, is difficult because of a man- eating shark named Dopey Dick (another parody, this time based on Moby-Dick), who persistently tries to catch Sam. However, Sam has gotten used to the wily shark's ways and keeps a few bludgeoning weapons on the islands on hand to drive him off. However, Sam finally gets tired of having to feed on coconuts for two decades. Right at that moment, though, Bugs Bunny, himself shipwrecked, drifts by. When Sam calls out to him, Bugs paddles towards the island, only to be immediately put into Sam's cooking pot. However, Bugs douses the flame with water from the pot, so Sam has to go back to his ship to get another match. However, by the time he gets back from the ship, Bugs has left the pot, which is now occupied by the shark, who nearly eats Sam until the latter manages to whack him into flight with a mallet. Bugs has retreated to the shipwreck,singing the song \\"Secret Love\\", from where he taunts Sam. Sam tries to reach him first with a surfboard, only to be driven back by the shark; then hanging from a balloon, only to be savaged by the shark once again after Bugs lets him sink into the flooded cargo hold. As Bugs tries to leave the ship, Sam catches him and puts him back into the pot. Just then, however, a huge tidal wave hits the islands, sinking them along with the ship. Bugs, adrift inside the pot, is soon joined by Sam fleeing the shark again. Bugs strikes a deal with him: in return from keeping him out of the shark's reach (by a gaff's length), Sam has to paddle them both 2,736 miles towards San Francisco. Home media Rabbitson Crusoe has been released on the Warner Home Video laserdisc Wince Upon A Time, the VHS release Bugs Bunny's Hare Raising Tales, and the DVD release Looney Tunes: Parodies Collection.

Premiership season In 1924, the VFL competition consisted of nine teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no reserves, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match. Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 18 rounds (i.e., 16 matches and 2 byes). Once the 18 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1924 VFL premiership was determined by an experimental 1924 finals system, which the VFL used in this season only. The format was similar to the round-robin format used in 1897 Finals System, but included the minor premier's right to challenge, which existed under the amended Argus System. =Round 1= - style=\\"background:#ccf;\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date -

The new scheme saw the top four clubs play a round-robin semi-finals series over three weeks, with two matches played each Saturday. Then, if the minor premiers did not finish on top of the round-robin ladder, a Grand Final would be played between the minor premiers and round-robin winner. Essendon ultimately finished on top of the finals ladder on the basis of its greater percentage than ; and, as minor premier, Essendon won the premiership without a Grand Final. The scheme was developed primarily as a result of demand for entry to finals matches in the early 1920s exceeding the capacity of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was noted that while an average of 80,000 spectators attended a four-game home- and-away round, the capacity of the Melbourne Cricket Ground was limited to about 55,000; and as such, under the Argus system in which only one final was played each day, many spectators were turned away. However, playing two semi- finals on each day would allow more spectators to attend. The original intent of the system was partially realised, with 65,000 spectators attending the first week of semi-finals and 60,000 attending the second week; although only 42,000 attended the third week – when the dead rubber between and was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the premiership-deciding – match was played on the smaller South Melbourne Cricket Ground. However, even the weeks with higher spectator numbers did not translate to better financial performance: extra competing teams meant more clubs whose members were entitled free admission and fewer neutral spectators paying at the gate. As a result, the new scheme was abandoned at the end of the year and the amended Argus system resumed from 1925. =Semi-finals= Week 1 - style=\\"background:#ccf;\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date - style=\\"background:#fff;\\"  ''''''  8.10 (58)   2.6 (18)  MCG  42,522  13 September 1924 - style=\\"background:#fff;\\"  ''''''  13.7 (85)   9.3 (57)  Windy Hill  22,300  13 September 1924 Week 2 - style=\\"background:#ccf;\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date - style=\\"background:#fff;\\"  ''''''  11.10 (76)   8.8 (56)  Princes Park  26,000  20 September 1924 - style=\\"background:#fff;\\"  ''''''  10.12 (72)   4.15 (39)  MCG  35,407  20 September 1924 Week 3 - style=\\"background:#ccf;\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date - style=\\"background:#fff;\\"  ''''''  9.13 (67)   6.11 (47)  Lake Oval  25,000  27 September 1924 - style=\\"background:#fff;\\"  ''''''  13.8 (86)   10.13 (73)  MCG  17,503  27 September 1924 =Finals ladder= =Finals team squads= As there was no designated grand final, this also meant that there were no grand final teams in 1924;Since the final round-robin match between Richmond and Essendon was played between the premiers and runners-up, it is sometimes mistakenly (and anachronistically) spoken of as being a \\"grand final\\". instead there was an Essendon finals squad, a Fitzroy finals squad\\", a Richmond finals squad\\", and a \\"South Melbourne finals squad\\". Listed in alphabetical order the four squads were: * Essendon squad: Fred Baring, Syd Barker, Sr. (captain), Norm Beckton, Clyde Donaldson, Charlie Farrell, Tom Fitzmaurice, Jack Garden, Harry Gregory, Charlie Hardy, Harry Hunter, Tommy Jenkins, Roy Laing, Frank Maher, Charlie May, Justin McCarthy, George Rawle, George Shorten, Greg Stockdale, Jimmy Sullivan, and Rowley Watt. * Fitzroy squad: Bill Adams, Jim Atkinson (captain), Arthur Batchelor, Les Bryant, Charlie Chapman, Goldie Collins, Tommy Corrigan, Arch Dickens, Steve Donnellan, Ern Elliott, Clive Fergie, Jimmy Freake, Len Gale, Tom Hickey, Horrie Jenkin, Gordon McCracken, Stan Molan, Jack Moriarty, Gordon Rattray, Jim Tarbotton, Len Wigraft, and Fred Williams. * Richmond squad: Jack Barnett, Ted Bourke, Ralph Empey, Clarrie Hall, Joe Harrison, Doug Hayes, Gordon Hislop, Max Hislop, Jim Karthaus, Bob McCaskill, Norm McIntosh, Angus MacIsaac, Keith Millar, Dan Minogue (captain), Mel Morris, Reuben Reid, George Rudolph, James Smith, Jim Spain, Ernie Taylor, Vic Thorp, and George Valentine. * South Melbourne squad: Harry Alexander, Bobby Allison, Phil Brooks, Martin Brown, Roy Cazaly (captain), Bill Condon, Fred Fleiter, Arthur Hando, Jacky Harris, Ted Johnson, Tom Joyce, Frank Laird, Harold Mahony, Herb Matthews, Bob McDonald, Charles McDonald, Gil Miller, Charlie Nicholls, Jack O'Connell, Ted O'Meara, Frank Ross, Joe Scanlan, Paddy Scanlan, Mark Tandy, and Les Woodfield. Awards * The 1924 VFL premiership team was Essendon. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Jack Moriarty of Fitzroy with 82 goals, a VFL record. (Moriarty had played 13 senior games for Essendon in 1922, and after playing in Essendon's Second Eighteen for 1923, and was released to Fitzroy). * The winner of the 1924 (inaugural) Brownlow Medal was Edward \\"Carji\\" Greeves of Geelong with 7 votes. * St Kilda took the wooden spoon in 1924. * The seconds grand final was scratched and the premiership was awarded to after minor premiers refused to travel to Geelong for the grand final. Notable events * Administrator Charles Brownlow died on 23 January 1924; the Charles Brownlow Trophy, more commonly known as the Brownlow Medal, was instituted in his memory. The trophy is to be awarded to \\"the fairest and best player\\" in the VFL as determined by the votes of the field umpire at the end of each home-and-away match. From 1924 to 1930, there was a single vote cast per match. *The VFL started fixing the schedule from 1924 to ensure that neither and nor and played home matches on the same day due to the heavy transport and labour burden associated with running the two nearby venues at the same time. This arrangement continued as long as the clubs played at nearby locations. * Bill Twomey, Sr. who played for Collingwood (1918–1922) and would play for Hawthorn (1933–1934), the father of Collingwood's Bill Twomey, Jr. (1945–1958), Pat Twomey (1947–1949; 1952–1953), and Mick Twomey (1951–1961), and the grandfather of Collingwood's David Twomey (1979–1985) wins the 1924, 130-yard Stawell Gift in 12.1 seconds, off a handicap of 8½ yards. * The Fitzroy versus Carlton match in the opening round was the first VFL match in which both teams scored 100 points. * The VFL adopts the convention of home teams wearing black shorts and away teams wearing white shorts. * Because the 1924 premiership was determined by a round-robin system, Essendon won the premiership despite being beaten by runners-up Richmond 9.13 (67) to 6.11 (47) in the last round-robin match; this is the only time in VFL/AFL history that the premiers lost their last match of the season. Richmond would have needed to win by at least 43 points to challenge Essendon to a grand final. * Many of the Essendon players were unhappy at the poor performances of some of their teammates in the final round robin match against Richmond, and there were heated arguments and fist-fights in the rooms after the match and after a post-match function later that evening, related to accusations of match fixing and receiving bribes. * On the Saturday after the VFL grand final, Essendon (in its role as 1924 VFL premiers) was challenged by 1924 VFA premiers, Footscray, to a match in aid of Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal, purportedly (but not officially) for the championship of Victoria. Footscray unexpectedly defeated Essendon 9.10 (64) to 4.12 (36). Again there were accusations of match fixing, and champion centre half-back Tom Fitzmaurice was so disgusted with many of his teammates having, in his view, deliberately lost the match, he never played again for Essendon. * The Seconds grand final, to have been staged between and minor premiers on 4 October, was originally scheduled to be played at Geelong's home ground, Corio Oval, but after Essendon raised its objections, the Seconds League rescheduled the match for Kardinia Park, which was a neutral venue, but still located in Geelong. Essendon again objected, and after the league dismissed their complaint, refused to travel to Geelong. Consequently, the match was scratched and the Seconds premiership was awarded to Geelong.

Early life Valentini was born and raised in Rhode Island. She graduated from Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) 1995 with degrees in fine arts and interior architecture. Career Upon graduation, Valentini and a colleague architect from RISD founded an interior architecture firm She was recognized for her award-winning designs for commercial and residential projects. Her interiors were customized down to the furniture and lighting. She soon evolved from interiors to establish her own signature materials, producing finished furniture, furnishings and personal accessories. In 2000 Valentini launched a series of successful furniture collections at the Providence Fine Furnishings Fair. She was juried into the New York International Contemporary Furniture Fair in 2001, making a splash with her innovative use of upcycled materials into sculptural furniture and lighting. Her work was fresh and innovative, using industrial materials like polyurethanes and ethylenes sculpted into organic forms. Her Coosh Egg Chair, a ball of high density foam cut from a block that breaks open into a chair and ottoman, received critical acclaim. This was chosen by Interior Design magazine for their future furniture competition, and was nominated for Best Product Design by the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. The chair is in the permanent collection at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. In 2002 Valentini exhibited in Gifu, Japan with Yoshiko Ebihara. Her work has appeared in galleries and museums in the US, Europe, and Asia. In 2003 she was asked to submit a body of work to the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum for their National Design Triennial; she was among 80 American designers to exhibit. In 2005 she developed a signature sculptural textile from a process of fusing and molding fabrics with foams into textures which are sensual yet protective and durable. Her innovative materials were selected to be among material libraries such as Material Connexion in New York, Scin in London, and Materia in Amsterdam. The Museum of Modern Art asked her to design a computer bag for their stores, using her material patented with a convoluted structure. In 2006 she exhibited in Second Skin with Ellen Lubton in Essen, Germany, Japan and Mexico. In 2007 Valentini launched her first collection of lifestyle bags for women and men. In addition to bags, she has successful jewelry collections, such as the DNA collection represented by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Japan, Korea, and Takashimaya in New York City, which also represented her bags. In 2009 she established a showroom, a gallery space and a roster of talent. Her showroom established her branded collections of sculptural lifestyle bags and furnishings, from her signature fabricated textiles to custom jewelry designed from industrial materials. Her gallery invited senior students to make the leap from school to street in effort to see their work in another context, expose them to a new audience, share, talk, show and sell their work for the first time in a gallery space accessible to the public. In 2009 Valentini asked her neighbor friend Olivia Culpo to model her bags and jewelry representing the face of her brand. Culpo quickly moved into pageantry and modeling, leading her to become Miss USA and Miss Universe 2012. In 2010 Valentini was asked to use her innovative fabric process to design an exclusive custom duffel bag for Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival in Chicago, which he would give to 30 of his friends and legendary guitarists who performed in support of the fundraiser for the Crossroads Centre Antigua. In 2010, 2011, and 2012, Valentini's sculptural fabrics made their debut on the runway in Style Week Fashion Shows in Providence, Rhode Island. She also participated in a sector of New York Fashion Week in 2012. Valentini's sculptural pieces were published in Inside Design Now 2003. Some of her pieces have been acquired by Vitra, Herman Miller, and Target. They have been featured in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Financial Times, Providence Journal, Interior Design, I.D., Dwell, Parenting, Surface, and Metropolis. Other activities Valentini is a member of the International Design Network Foundation. She was a board member of Rhode Island Council for the Arts from 2007 to 2013. She is also an adjunct professor in the Industrial Design Department and lecturer in Textiles at the Rhode Island School of Design.

It occurs in dry open woodlands and moist savanna in Africa south of the Sahara, but is absent from the equatorial forest belt. There are three subspecies: * E. f. flaviventris, the nominate form, occurs from in the rest of the range from the Cape to southernmost Sudan. * E. f. flavigaster occurs in a narrow belt across the southern edge of the Sahara, and its range is discontinuous with the other subspecies. * E. f. princeps occurs in southern Angola and Namibia. Description The golden-breasted bunting is 15–16 cm long. The adult male has striking head pattern with a white crown, black lateral crown stripes, white supercilium and black-bordered white ear coverts. The underparts are orange-yellow becoming yellow on the throat and whitish on the lower belly. The upperparts are chestnut with a grey rump. The browner wings have two conspicuous white wing bars. The sexes are very similar, but females may have a buff tone to the white head markings and browner head stripes, and the back may have dark streaks. Young birds are duller and paler than the females. =Subspecies= E. f. princeps is similar to the nominate form, but larger, and paler below. E. f. flavigaster is more distinctive, having a paler, redder back, pale grey rump, paler yellow underparts and whiter flanks. The golden-breasted bunting's call is a nasal ascending zzhrr. The song is variable, but includes a weechee weechee weechee. Habitat This species is found in a variety of open woodlands. The subspecies flavigaster favours acacia steppe and savannah, with the other subspecies occurring in a wider range of lightly wooded country including gardens. Behaviour Juvenile in Namibia The golden-breasted bunting builds an untidy cup nest lined with fine grass or hair low in a shrub or sapling. The two or three eggs are glossy white or cream and marked with black lines. The eggs hatch in 12–13 days and the chicks fledge in another 16–17 days. The golden-breasted bunting is not gregarious, and is normally seen alone, in pairs or small groups. It feeds on the ground on seeds, insects and spiders, animal prey being taken mostly when the birds have young. This species is generally resident, but there appears to be degree of local movement. It is often quite tame.

Initially engaged in general trading, they gradually built up big businesses by purchasing dealerships for international products, and also successfully investing in property. Most of them acquired local citizenship. This was possible as Botswana permits expatriates with over ten years’ residence in the country to apply for permanent residence status and citizenship. A number of Indians who went to the country more recently have also become citizens of Botswana. Some of them have taken an active part in politics. Diamond business The discovery of diamonds and their mining from the late 1960s saw the beginning of a sustained economic boom in Botswana. This attracted many more PIOs to this country. Both professionals and businessmen arrived there from several African countries, especially South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and even from Kenya and Uganda. Botswana's government does not encourage immigration of foreign labour, but with its shortage of skilled manpower, it started recruiting Indian experts directly from India from the late 1980s – teachers, doctors, engineers and civil servants.. The political leadership and the higher bureaucracy are appreciative of its contribution towards the development of the country. Politics While no PIO has so far won any election to the parliament of Botswana, one has become a nominated member.

The duo were renowned for their improvisational approach to noise music, creating a unique experience for each live performance. They described their music as \\"a constantly evolving mass of psychedelic noise that is both physically arresting and psychically liberating\\". The band consisted of Pete Swanson (vocals, drum machine, electronics) and Gabriel Mindel Saloman (guitar, feedback, electronics). The band announced their split in April 2008. Career The duo formed in Portland, Oregon in 2001. From here they established their own collective art label, JYRK where the band self-released several CD-Rs and cassettes of their music. The JYRK collective also included E*Rock and sometimes Pat Maherr (Sisprum Vish, Indignant Senility, DJ Yo-Yo Dieting). With frequent touring and shows with artists including Tussle, Xiu Xiu and Japanther, the duo moved to Oakland, California for two years. In 2003, they recorded their debut album, Bring The Neon War Home, and continued to tour across the USA. Their debut album garnered much recognition and soon the band were invited to perform shows across Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In October 2005, Numerical Thief, a Melbourne-based label, debuted the release of the band's second studio album, Psychic Secession. It was later re-mastered and released on LOAD Records the same year, and then released on 12\\" vinyl by Weird Forest in 2006. Throughout their existence, the duo used the moniker of D Yellow Swans, where the \\"D\\" can be substituted for any word beginning with the letter. This began as a joke when the band formed, and became \\"a fun take on anti-branding...[it's] not really meant to be elitist though\\". They used several different names over the past six years, as can be seen in their discography, but are most commonly referred to as simply Yellow Swans. In April 2008, Pete Swanson announced the band's break up. In an email to Pitchfork Media, Swanson stated \\"There are no specific reasons why we've come to this point, but both Gabriel [Mindel Saloman] and I have decided that it's in our best interest to move on from the project. Neither of us have any intention to stop playing music anytime soon, but we will not be playing or performing with each other again.\\" The group played their last US show in the city of Chicago.

The building is located along prestigious Central Park West and was built in 1910, it opened in 1911. Cast in the Arts and Crafts style, a rarity for New York City, Harperly Hall was designed by Henry W. Wilkinson. The structure was listed as a contributing property to the U.S. federal government designated Central Park West Historic District in 1982 when the district joined the National Register of Historic Places. At one time it was known as the Madonna building as Sean Penn and singer Madonna lived there together, then she sans Penn, then owned in absentia by the entertainer, and finally the material girl selling the spread in 2013 for $16 million US.https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/big- ticket-madonnas-apartment-for-16-million/ History Henry Wilhelm Wilkinson, the building's architect, and a group investors purchased the property at the northwest corner of 64th Street and Cntral Park West in 1909. The original group included Wilkinson, decorator Mary Bookwalter, artist Dwight Tryon, humorist Wallace Irwin, and concert manager Loudon Charlton. According to filed corporate papers the goal was to build a co-operative \\"suitable for artists' studios.\\" The building was named after a manor house in County Durham, England, the Wilkinson's ancestral home. By March 1910 construction on Harperly Hall was nearing completion, the building represented the first housing co-operative in the Central Park West area. The building officially opened in 1911 with 76 apartments. Architecture Harperly Hall gate The building at 41 Central Park West was designed by architect Henry W. Wilkinson. Wilkinson's design is unique from the typical apartment building design of the day. Wilkinson, who had little experience designing apartment-houses, used the Arts and Crafts style liberally, throughout the structure. Though the building is cast mostly in the Arts and Crafts style, a rarity for New York City, it does contain elements of the Neo-Italian Renaissance style.Central Park West Historic District , (Java), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, New York's State and National Registers of Historic Places Document Imaging Project , New York State Historic Preservation Office.

This forms a \\"carpet-like\\" texture which gives the building a handmade character. Glazed tiles highlight the surface where they provide colorful displays of gold, turquoise and green.

The premiership was won by the Geelong Football Club, after it defeated by ten points in the Grand Final. The 1925 season saw the admission of three new clubs – , and – all of which cross to the VFL from the Victorian Football Association after an off-field struggle which lasted for much of the summer. Expansion of the VFL =Public Service Football Club= In July 1924, the Public Service Football Club, a club whose players would consist entirely of state and federal public servants rather than being drawn from a geographical recruiting district, was established and applied to join the VFL. Melbourne Carnivals Ltd had offered to lease the Public Service club its newly developed venue, the Amateur Sports Ground, for football if it could gain entrance to the league. The venue was centrally located, between Batman Avenue and Swan Street, the site which later became Olympic Park, and was to have been expanded to a capacity of 100,000. The VFL was keen to have control over the venue, and equally keen to prevent the VFA or the local rugby league or soccer associations from controlling such a valuable asset. Since the end of World War I, the VFL had contained nine clubs; and, while the League had taken applications several times for a tenth club, it had each time opted to remain at nine clubs. But, the availability of the Amateur Sports Ground was an important strategic opportunity, and in September 1924, the VFL formally resolved to \\"draw up a scheme for the inclusion of one or more clubs, and secure the Amateur Sports Ground for the League\\" before the 1925 season. =Claims of the Footscray Football Club= While the league reviewed the application of the Public Service, it was also fielding other applications, most notably that of the Footscray Football Club from the VFA. Footscray was widely regarded as the strongest candidate among existing clubs to join the VFL, and had been considered as such for many years. It was the richest VFA club, had a strong corporate backing due to its location in the heart of the industrial district of the western suburbs, and it had dominated the Association since the war, winning four of the previous six premierships and five minor premierships in a row. Its win against VFL premiers Essendon in Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal match at the end of the 1924 season had affirmed its credentials. Admitting the Public Service team would have met both of the League's aims, but admitting Footscray would not have secured the Amateur Sports Ground. The League investigated other means of securing the venue without having to admit Public Service, including having leave the nearby Punt Road Oval to use it as a home venue, having play all of its away matches at the venue, or scheduling each club to play one or more of its home games at the neutral venue – similar to the way that VFL Park was later used in the 1970s and 1980s. There were two other significant problems with admitting Footscray – or indeed any other club from the VFA: *Firstly, in 1915 the VFL had introduced district-based recruiting; and and , the two clubs set to lose parts of their district to Footscray, would have opposed any change. The Public Service team did not have this issue, as its recruitment would have been profession-based, not district- based. *Secondly, since 1923 there had been a five-year agreement in place between the VFA and VFL in which the two bodies were required to recognise the validity of the other's transfer clearances; ergo a player could not transfer from a VFA club to a VFL club without the VFA's permission. The VFA would almost certainly have refused to grant clearances for the entire Footscray playing list to transfer to the VFL, and the agreement gave the VFA legal recourse to seek an injunction against the move. The newly established Public Service team would not have had this issue. The implications of this transfer agreement were discussed so frequently during the off-season that it became simply known as the agreement. After having waited many months without response since first applying to the VFL in July 1924, the Public Service withdrew its application on 3 November and submitted an application to join the VFA; and in December, the VFA provisionally accepted the application. However, Melbourne Carnivals withdrew its offer to the Public Service to use the Amateur Sports Ground (now known as the Motordrome, with a motorcycling arena having been installed in November) in the meantime. Public Service was unable to secure a replacement, so withdrew from the VFA without playing a game. =Breaking the agreement= With the Public Service club no longer available, and 'the agreement' all but preventing the VFL from admitting a VFA club, it looked likely that the VFL would remain at nine teams. But, in December 1924, the VFA admitted the Coburg Football Club, from the VFL seconds competition, into its senior ranks. The VFL contended that 'the agreement' was valid specifically between the two bodies as they were constituted at the time it was signed; and that by admitting a new club, the constitution of the VFA had changed and the agreement was voided. This gave the VFL the opportunity to admit VFA clubs. The VFA considered its legal position, but decided not to proceed, the result being that both competitions considered the agreement broken. =Admission of new VFL clubs= With 'the agreement' no longer an impediment, the VFL set about admitting a tenth club. and were both discussed, but both were rejected by the clubs set to lose sections of their recruiting districts. It was then proposed to admit three clubs instead of one; the VFL delegates agreed, and , and were admitted. This league saw two specific benefits with this scheme: *Firstly, the loss of recruiting districts would be spread more evenly across the existing clubs. *Secondly, now that 'the agreement' was broken, the VFA clubs would be free to spend as much money as was required to entice high quality VFL players into the VFA, the cessation of which had been the motivation for the VFL to sign the agreement in the first place; but, by admitting three of the VFA's strongest clubs, it would so significantly strengthen the position of the VFL compared to the VFA that it would reduce the VFA's bargaining power. One impediment to admitting was that the State Government had prevented the VFL from moving into the Arden Street Oval in 1921, after protest from the VFA that it would lose its most central venue. The VFL wrote to the Minister for Lands and obtained the necessary permission from the minister to use the venue before it was able to admit North Melbourne. It is thought that Prahran would have been the twelfth team, had this permission not been obtained. Through all of this, the VFL failed to secure use of the Motordrome, and the VFA began using it for finals matches, but it never became one of its regularly used venues. It never was expanded to become the 100,000 capacity, strategically critical, centrally located venue once imagined. Premiership season In 1925, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no \\"reserves\\", although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match. Teams played each other in a home-and-away season of 17 rounds; matches 12 to 17 were the \\"home-and-away reverse\\" of matches 1 to 6. Once the 17 round home- and-away season had finished, the 1925 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended \\"Argus system\\". =Round 1= - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date -

Awards * The 1925 VFL Premiership team was Geelong. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Lloyd Hagger of Geelong with 78 goals. * The winner of the 1925 Brownlow Medal Colin Watson of St Kilda, with 9 votes. * Hawthorn on debut, took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1925. * The seconds premiership was won by . Collingwood 13.16 (94) defeated 11.4 (70) in the challenge Grand Final, played as a curtain raiser to the firsts Grand Final on 10 October at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Notable events * The laws of the game were altered so that the last player to touch the ball before it went out of bounds was penalised by the award of a free kick to the opposing team. This meant that almost all of the play was directed up the centre of the ground along the goal-to-goal line, and very little was directed along the flanks at the sides of the ground. This brought a considerable advantage to full-forwards. * At half-time in the spiteful Round 12 match at Arden Street between North Melbourne and Geelong, Fred Rutley of North Melbourne knocked Lloyd Hagger of Geelong to the ground with a round-arm action; Hagger's teammates, Arthur Coghlan and Stan Thomas, then remonstrated with Rutley, and the three exchanged punches, starting an all-in brawl which involved players and team officials. Coghlan was hit in the knee with a missile thrown from the crowd, while Geelong captain Cliff Rankin and teammate Sid Hall were left unconscious and having to be carried from the field on stretchers. Geelong were also threatened and pelted with missiles by angry North Melbourne fans while leaving the field at the end of the match. Six players were reported on a total of seventeen offences: Fred Rutley of North Melbourne: Charged with two counts of kicking Sid Hall, striking Lloyd Hagger, striking Arthur Coghlan, striking Stan Thomas, and melee involvement. Suspended for life (Rutley was reinstated by the VFL in 1930, having served 89 matches). Stan Thomas of Geelong: Charged with elbowing Bill Russ, striking Fred Rutley and melee involvement. Suspended until 31 December 1926 (26 matches). Arthur Coghlan of Geelong: Charged with striking Fred Rutley and melee involvement. Suspended until 31 December 1926 (26 matches). Bill Russ of North Melbourne: Charged with striking Cliff Rankin and melee involvement. Suspended until 31 December 1925 (5 matches). Tim Trevaskis of North Melbourne: Charged with striking Les Smith and melee involvement. Suspended for 3 matches. Harold Johnston of North Melbourne: Charged with striking Stan Thomas and melee involvement. Reprimanded.

Born in Lascelles Hall, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England, Lockwood was the nephew of John Thewlis senior, who also played for Yorkshire from 1862 to 1875, and the brother of Ephraim Lockwood, who played from 1868 to 1884, and was related to the cricketing Eastwood and Bates families who also lived at Lascelles Hall. By no means as talented as Ephriam, he was a good league professional, being engaged in 1879 at Hollen Hall, Oldham and at Rochdale C.C. from 1884 to 1886. In 1892, he played for Burnley St Andrews C.C, in 1894 and 1895 with Cockermouth C.C. and, in 1897, with the Little Lever Club, Bolton. Like his father and other relations he was a weaver by trade.

Starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Abigail Breslin, the screenplay by Carol Fuchs is an adaptation of an original script by Sandra Nettelbeck, which served as the basis for the 2001 German film Mostly Martha, and revolves around a hard-edged chef whose life is turned upside down when she decides to take in her young niece following a tragic accident that killed her sister. Patricia Clarkson, Bob Balaban, and Jenny Wade co-star, with Brían F. O'Byrne, Lily Rabe, and Zoë Kravitz—appearing in her first feature film—playing supporting roles. The film received a mixed reception by critics, who found it \\"predictable and too melancholy for the genre\\", resulting in a 42% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes. Upon its opening release on July 27, 2007, in the United States and Canada, No Reservations became a moderate commercial success: The film grossed $12 million in its opening weekend, eventually grossing over $43 million at the domestic box-office and over $92 million worldwide. Breslin was nominated for a Young Artist Award for her performance. Plot Kate Armstrong is the head chef at the trendy 22 Bleecker Street Restaurant in Manhattan’s West Village. She runs her kitchen at a rapid pace as she coordinates the making and preparation of all the fantastic meals, and personally displays the food to perfection on every dish. She intimidates everyone around her, including her boss Paula, who sends her to therapy. Kate hates to leave the kitchen when a customer wants to compliment her on one of her special dishes; however, she is ready to leave the kitchen in an instant when a customer insults her cooking. When Kate's sister Christine is killed in a car accident, her nine-year-old niece, Zoe, must move in with her. Kate is devastated by her sister's death and with all of her problems, Paula decides to hire a new sous chef to join the staff, Nick Palmer, who is a rising star in his own right and could be the head chef of any restaurant he pleased. Nick, however, wants to work under Kate. The atmosphere in the kitchen is somewhat chaotic as Kate feels increasingly threatened by Nick as time goes on due to his style of running her kitchen. Nick loves to listen to opera while he cooks and he loves to make the staff laugh. And Kate finds herself strangely attracted to Nick, whose uplifting personality has not only affected her staff but Zoe as well, who has been coming to work with Kate. With all that is happening in Kate's life, the last thing she would want is to fall in love with this man, as she has pushed away all others prior. Nevertheless, there is some kind of chemistry between the two of them that only flourishes with their passion for cooking. Yet life hits her hard when Paula decides to offer Nick the job of head chef and Kate's relationship with Nick turns a sour note due to Kate's pride. Nick also develops a special bond with Zoe. In the end, Kate allows herself to become vulnerable and tear down the walls she has built throughout her life so that she and Nick could start fresh. The movie concludes with Zoe, Nick, and Kate having opened their own bistro.

Reception =Critical reception= Rotten Tomatoes, an aggregator of reviews from published critics, showed that 42% of them reviewed it favorably based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 5.25/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"This romantic comedy may look good on paper, but it's too predictable and melancholy for the genre.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Matt Zoller Seitz of The New York Times said, \\"What's unexpected and gratifying ... is the film's enlightened attitude toward parenthood and work, which the movie's publicity campaign conspicuously glosses over, even though it's the story's driving force ... Make no mistake: No Reservations is a factory-sealed romantic comedy ... But the emotional details of Kate, Nick and Zoe's journey are surprising, honest and life-size, and the film's determination to present their predicament sympathetically, without appealing to retrograde ideals of femininity and motherhood, makes it notable, and in some ways unique.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, \\"The movie is focused on two kinds of chemistry: of the kitchen, and of the heart. The kitchen works better, with shots of luscious-looking food, arranged like organic still lifes. But chemistry among Nick, Kate and Zoe is curiously lacking, except when we sense some fondness—not really love—between Zoe and her potential new dad ... the characters seem to feel more passion for food than for each other.\\" Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"one of those movies that presents life precisely and meticulously as it isn't, presumably as some kind of consolation for how it really is\\" and added, \\"With its simplistic compartmentalization of dueling personality types, kindergarten view of grown- up love, exquisite styling, overripe camera moves and lousy, overwrought score, the movie feels stubbornly, resolutely disingenuous and one- dimensional. Everything in it is designed to make you feel better, so why does it feel artificial and palliative in that really depressing way?\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety observed, \\"Agreeably prepared and attractively presented, this remake of the tasty 2001 German feature Mostly Martha bears too many earmarks of Hollywood packaging and emotional button-pushing, but doesn't go far wrong by closely sticking to the original's smart story construction ... Scott Hicks' work cuts both ways, creating a warm cocoon that fosters engagement with the well-drawn characters while at the same time steering the material in softer-than-necessary directions and refraining from peeking any deeper into the main characters to suggest what makes them tick. Without question, Ratatouille deals more profoundly with the personality makeup and urges of a driven chef-as-artist than does this genial divertissement.\\" =Box office= No Reservations was released in 2,425 theaters in the US on July 27, 2007, and earned $11,704,357 and ranked fifth on its opening weekend. The film eventually grossed $43,107,979 in the US and $49,493,071 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $92,601,050. Awards and nominations Abigail Breslin was nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Young Actress for her performance as Zoe.

From this point onwards the road is now known as Whitehouse Road and weaves its way through King's Forest Golf Course and King's Forest Park. History Albion Falls, a classical/cascade waterfall, and one of Hamilton's 100+ waterfalls, can be found here at the back-end of King's Forest Park. A nearby parking lot was removed when the construction of the nearby Red Hill Valley Parkway started. A parking lot at Mountain Brow Road above the falls for 50+ cars is still available for visitors. Up to the early 1900s a small vibrant village called Albion Mills was found here. The rocks from Albion Falls area were used to construct the Rock Garden at the Royal Botanical Gardens. Another waterfall can be found nearby, northwest of Albion Falls called, Buttermilk Falls. Not too far off and just east of the newly built Red Hill Valley Parkway at the Glendale Golf & Country Club is another waterfall called, Glendale Falls on Mount Albion Road. King's Forest Golf Club was established in 1974 and is run by the city of Hamilton. The Red Hill Creek and many fair-sized ponds come into play.

His many landholdings are listed in the Domesday Book of 1086. Origins According to Cawley, primary evidence is lacking to determine his parentage, but he is generally said to have been a son of Roger I of Tosny.

Death and burial Robert de Stafford was buried in Evesham Abbey. End of the Stafford family The peak of the Stafford family was reached by Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham (1477–1521), who was executed for treason in 1521, on whose death \\"the princely House of Stafford fell to rise no more\\".Cleveland Cleveland relates the descent of his children into obscurity and poverty as follows: :His only son, stripped alike of lands and dignities, received back a small fraction of its splendid possessions, with a seat and voice in parliament as a baron, and this title was borne by several generations. Edward, fourth Lord Stafford, \\"basely married to his mother's chambermaid,\\" was succeeded by his grandson Henry, with whom the direct line terminated in 1637; and the claim of the last remaining heir, Roger, was rejected by the House of Lords on account of his poverty. This unfortunate man, the great-grandson of the last Duke, was then sixty-five, and had sunk into so abject a condition that he felt ashamed of bearing his own name, and long passed as Fludd, or Floyde, having, it is supposed, assumed the patronymic of one of his uncle's servants, who had reared and sheltered him in early life. He was compelled to surrender his barony to Charles I, and died unmarried in 1640; leaving an only sister, Jane, who in spite of her Plantagenet blood married a joiner, and had a son gaining a poor livelihood as a cobbler in 1637 at Newport in Shropshire\\". =Surviving direct descendants= The Gresley family of Drakelow, baronets, were descendants of the de Tosny family through their de Stafford ancestors, including Robert.On the Bradshaws and Staffords of Eyam, with a Notice of the Old Hall, Peter Furness Esq., GENUKI As Cleveland (d.1901) relates in her Battle Roll: :One remaining branch of the royal Toenis still flourishes in the male line. Nigel de Toeni or De Stafford, a younger brother of the standard bearer's, held Drakelow, Gresley, and some other manors in Derbyshire and Staffordshire at the date of Domesday ; the former \\" by the service of rendering a bow without a string ; a quiver of Tutesbit (?) twelve fleched and one unfeathered arrow,\\" sometimes called a buzon. Castle-Gresley took its name from his castle; and Church-Gresley marks the site of an Augustinian priory founded by his son William in the time of Henry I. Roger, the next heir, first bore the name of Gresley, that has been carried down to our own time by a long and honourable line of descent. His successors continued at Drakelow, and since the time of the first Edward have at various periods served as knights of the shire and High Sheriffs of their native county. Sir Geoffrey, in 1330, claimed the right of having a gallows at Drakelow and Gresley; Sir Nicholas, during the same reign, married a great heiress, Thomasin de Wasteneys ; Sir William served Henry VIII. in his French wars, and dying issueless, was succeeded by his brother George, who was installed a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Anne Boleyn. Two others. Sir William and Sir Thomas, one Sheriff of Stafford, the other of Derby, were knighted by Queen Elizabeth ; and the next in succession, George, received a baronetcy in 1611. \\" He was an active officer in the Parliamentary service during the Civil War, and was Lieut. -Colonel to Sir William Gell.\\" — Lysons. In the beginning of the present century Sir Roger Gresley alienated much of the property ; and, having no children, parcelled out the remainder in such a manner that, by annual sales, it should last him his life ; but he died a comparatively young man, and Drakelow, \\" the only estate remaining in the county that has continued in the same family from the time of Domesday,\\" is now held by his representative, Sir Robert Gresley.

Produced by Metrowealth Movies and directed by Ahmad Idham, the film premiered in August 2006.  Synopsis  The story is about a Mat Rempit named Madi who works as a dispatch boy by day and street racer by night. As a Mat Rempit, his activities at night include street racing and performing various Mat Rempit stunts such as the wheelie, Superman, wikang, etc. Madi has a girlfriend named Ieka who asks him to marry her after each time they have sex. But Madi only focuses on collecting his money to buy a [Yamaha 125Z], since he only owns a modified Honda EX-5 which is not very powerful enough for street racing. Madi also has a best friend named Macha who gives him information about each street race that Madi is to take part in. After paying for the motorcycle in cash, Madi and Macha modify it heavily and tune it to the maximum. After winning many street races, a challenger named Spark comes along with his gang to challenge Madi for a pink slip race (i.e. the loser has to give his vehicle to the winner). Madi loses the race and he is supposed to give away his Yamaha 125Z to Spark as promised, but Madi instead decides to run away with Spark's Yamaha TZM 150. However, Spark and his gang managed to chase him and beat him severely. Madi is severely injured and his right leg is fractured by Spark during the fight. What's worse, his motorcycle has been destroyed by Spark and his gangs. Ieka sees the incident and turns to Spark and his gang. Six months later, Madi is no longer a dispatch boy. He is now working as a mechanic in a motorcycle workshop. One day, an underling of Spark's comes to the workshop and is beaten by Madi. After beating him, Madi asks Spark's underling for a one-make rematch race with the Yamaha RX-Z. Then Macha meets Madi at the workshop and brings him to Wazi's place to buy his Yamaha RX-Z. With the second-hand motorcycle bought from Wazi, Madi begins modifying and practising with the bike once he has fully recovered. The time for the final showdown arrives. Madi, Spark and several other Mat Rempits races along Shah Alam Expressway. Some of the Mat Rempits crash at a toll plaza while others crash at the motorcycle lane along the expressway, leaving only Madi and Spark. After a fierce challenge along the Shah Alam Expressway, Spark plays a cheap shot - he kicks Madi, causing him to skid under a lorry and die after hitting his head on a road barrier. Spark, however, escapes. The movie ends here, but during the ending credits of the movie, it is revealed that Spark has finally been arrested and jailed by the police. Meanwhile, Macha has quit being a Mat Rempit and married Ieka as a result of the tragedy that caused him to lose his best friend.

In 1922 the Diocese of Johannesburg, covering the Southern Transvaal, was formed. In the 1980s and 1990s several new dioceses were formed. The northernmost part of the diocese covered what is today the Limpopo Province. Suffragan Bishops were often based at Christ Church, Polokwane (then, Pietersburg) to oversee the mission work of the church. In 1957 Bishop Robert Selby Taylor decided to make Pietersburg the centre of the Archdeaconry of the North. In the 1980s a suffragan bishop, John Ruston, was sent to oversee the region. Under his leadership a new diocese was formed. The Anglican Diocese of St Mark the Evangelist was inaugurated in 1987.

It removed the border after the republic had become a British colony again in 1902, and changed the upper half of the shield to blue. In this form, the arms were granted by the College of Arms in 1954, and registered at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1964.

S. Lewis. Introduced in the 1952 book The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, she aids Caspian X and the crew of Dawn Treader to break an enchantment on three of the Seven Great Lords of Narnia. Eventually she becomes Queen of Narnia, after marrying Caspian X, and bears his son, Rilian. In the 1953 novel The Silver Chair, the Lady of the Green Kirtle, in the form of a snake, kills her though she later reappears in the 1956 book The Last Battle. The character appears in adaptations of the book series, the television serial The Chronicles of Narnia, portrayed by Gabrielle Anwar, and The Chronicles of Narnia film series, where Laura Brent plays the role. According to Lewis scholar Paul F. Ford, Lewis created the character of Ramandu's daughter having been inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth elves, specifically Lúthien and Arwen. Ramandu's daughter has also been compared to the angelic entities known as Maiar, also featured in Tolkien's novels. Douglas Gresham, Lewis' step-son, created the name Lilliandil for the 2010 film version of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Ramandu's daughter was the subject of literary analysis by various scholars, with her goodness and her marriage with Caspian X receiving attention. The character has been associated with various Christian virtues and women in the Bible. Role =Literature= Ramandu's daughter is introduced in C. S. Lewis's 1952 book The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.Ford (2005): pp. 96–97 In the novel, siblings Edmund and Lucy Pevensie and their cousin Eustace Scrubb are transported to the fantasy world Narnia through a painting of a boat; they help Caspian X, the king of Narnia, sail to the edge of the world on the ship Dawn Treader in order to find the Seven Great Lords of Narnia. As part of their journey, they travel to Ramandu's Island, which is home to the \\"star at rest\\" Ramandu,Ford (2005): p. 258 and are greeted by his daughter. Lewis only references the character through titles, never by her name. Portrayed as a young and beautiful immortal woman with long blonde hair, she is first shown wearing a blue gown and holding a lit candle. The character provides hope to Caspian X and his companions, who had discovered that the Lords Mavramorn, Revilian and Argoz were cursed by a sleeping enchantment. Caspian X talks about the fairy tale \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" with Ramandu's daughter and suggests kissing her to reverse the curse on the lords.Ford (2005): p. 134 She tells him that she will only kiss him once the enchantment is broken,Karkainen (2007) and proposes to him. Caspian X makes a promise to her before departing that he will break the curse. He returns to Ramandu's Island three years after the end of his voyage, and marries Ramandu's daughter;Sammons (2000): p. 23Brown (2013) the couple serves as the rulers of Narnia. Fifteen years into their rule, Ramandu's daughter and Caspian X have a son named Rilian. In the 1953 novel The Silver Chair, the Lady of the Green Kirtle, in the form of a snake, kills Ramandu's daughter while she is sleeping in a glade during a May ride with a twenty-year old Rilian. Her body is taken back to the city, and she is remembered as \\"a gracious and wise lady in whose veins flowed the blood of stars\\".Ford (2005): p. 97 While attempting to seek revenge for his mother's death, Rilian is seduced by the Lady of the Green Kirtle. In the 1956 book The Last Battle, Ramandu's daughter is present, alongside her husband and son, as one of the \\"faithful\\" during the Great Reunion, in which all the series' good characters are brought back together.Ford (2005): p. 166 =Television and film= Ramandu's daughter appears in the sections of the television serial The Chronicles of Narnia focusing on The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. In the miniseries, the character is portrayed in the same way as in the books, with her relationship and eventual marriage to Caspian X being the focus of her story arc. For the 2010 film version of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Ramandu's daughter is called Lilliandil. After Caspian X and his companions feast at Aslan's table a star falls from the sky and transforms into Lilliandil. She guides Caspian X and his crew to the Dark Island to find and save one of the Seven Great Lords of Narnia from a curse. Lilliandil tells Caspian X that the Lords were placed under a sleeping enchantment as they had physically threatened one another in Aslan's presence, which is strictly forbidden. After guiding the company to the island, she returns to the heavens; Caspian X says that he hopes to meet her again in the future, and she responds with a smile.  Development and casting  According to Lewis scholar Paul F. Ford, Lewis decided to not name Ramandu's daughter as \\"an indication of the awe in which [he] wanted to surround her\\". Fantasy writer Colin Duriez said that Lewis was inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth elves, specifically Lúthien and Arwen, who are both married to humans, to create the character. Duriez also connected Ramandu's daughter's parentage from the heavens to Tolkien's descriptions of angelic entities known as Maiar in his novels.Duriez (2004): p. 204 For the television serial, English actress Gabrielle Anwar portrays Ramandu's daughter in one of her earliest roles;Simpson (2013) she is credited as Princess. Australian actress Laura Brent plays the character in the film version of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; it was her first role in a feature film. Lewis' step-son Douglas Gresham created the name Lilliandil for the movie,McColman (2010) and he said that it was intended to mimic the \\"imagery of the sea of lilies in the book as well as a very feminine and ethereal feel\\". Character analysis According to academics, Lewis characterizes Ramandu's daughter through her goodness. Elizabeth Baird Hardy, a scholar of mythology, cited the character as \\"one of the few positive individuals who first appears as a full-grown adult\\". Fantasy literature scholar Monika B. Hilder interpreted Ramandu's daughter and Caspian X as \\"wise rulers willing to suffer for what is right for as long as they both shall live\\". English literature professor Devin Brown wrote that the character's respect for Aslan defines her goodness, in comparison to the evilness of the White Witch and her anger toward the lion. Analyzing Ramandu's daughter as a \\"saintly mother\\", author Cathy McSporran contrasted her with the Lady of the Green Kirtle.McSporran (2005): pp. 197–198 She identified the latter, and all witches in The Chronicles of Narnia series, as embodying what Lewis characterizes as an \\"infernal Venus\\"; he coined this term in his 1942 book The Screwtape Letters to reference a female character who seduces a man to his death.McSporran (2005): p. 195 McSporran defined Ramandu's daughter as the \\"natural opponent\\" of witches due to her innate goodness and beauty. According to McSporran, the character's maternal care for Rilian and ability to see through magical disguises are signs of her opposition to the Lady of the Green Kirtle. Critics commented on the relationship between Ramandu’s daughter and Caspian X. The pair's relationship is one of the few romantic story arcs in The Chronicles of Narnia series. Devin Brown positively compared their courtship to that of Arwen and Aragorn from J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings. Brown also wrote that Lewis foreshadows to the relationship through Caspian X's failed courtship with the Duke of Galma prior to The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. While Lewis scholar Michael Ward cited the couple as an example of how the author was not \\"averse to his characters growing up and having romances\\", children's literature scholar Jennifer L. Miller felt that Lewis does not elaborate on their marriage in the novels. Miller wrote that the characters' interactions as husband and wife were restricted to the space between The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Silver Chair, only occurring in a place separate from Narnia. She argued that the portrayal of the pair’s relationship represented how \\"romantic love and desire can exist in exotic, strange locations far from Narnia\\", while Lewis reserved the fictional world as \\"the land of innocence and wonder\\" where such ideas would be inadmissible.Miller (2009): pp. 114–15 =Religious analysis= Some critics argued that Lewis portrays Ramandu's daughter through Christian virtues. Connecting Ramandu's daughter with the women in the House of Holiness from Edmund Spenser's 1590 epic poem The Faerie Queene, Elizabeth Baird Hardy interpreted her titles as \\"idealized identifications of the virtues they represent\\", with Lewis' character corresponding to charity and hope. Monika B. Hilder argued that it is Ramandu's daughter's beauty that is used to signal her virtue, specifically through her positive effect on Caspian X.Hilder (2016): p. 94 While describing the character's identity and agency, Hilder referred to her as \\"a mature, virtuous woman who is neither enchanted nor requires marriage to be whole\\"; Hilder wrote that Ramandu's daughter has an \\"active moral agency [which] underscores powerful humility\\" as well as \\"'feminine' obedience\\" and spirituality.Hilder (2016): p. 95 Ramandu's daughter was compared to women in the Bible.Hardy (2016): p. 93 Hardy wrote that Ramandu's daughter was similar to Eve before the fall of man, describing them as \\"free from pretension and keenly aware of their roles in the universe\\". Hardy paralleled the death of Ramandu's daughter with the fall of Eve, comparing Rilian's addiction to sorcery and sexuality to the original sin.Hardy (2016): p. 94 Aside from Eve, Ramandu's daughter was also likened to the Grail Maiden. Cathy McSporran likened the character's possession of the Knife of Stone, an instrument used to martyr Aslan, to the maiden's connection with the Holy Grail and the spear used in the crucifixion of Jesus.

Sawyer.Science Fiction Writer Robert J. Sawyer: FAR-SEER Index It is the first book of the Quintaglio Ascension Trilogy, and is followed by two sequels: Fossil Hunter and Foreigner. The book depicts an Earth-like world on a moon which orbits a gas giant, inhabited by a species of highly evolved, sentient Tyrannosaurs called Quintaglios, among various other creatures from the late cretaceous period, imported to this moon by aliens 65 million years prior to the story. Originally published in 1992 by Ace Science Fiction, it won the Homer award for \\"Best Novel\\" during its initial release date. It was reissued in 2004 by Tor Books. Plot summary The story begins with the main character, Afsan, looking at the stars and reflecting upon his arrival at Capital city, where he is working as an apprentice under the Court Astrologer, Tak-Saleed. Afsan is but one of many apprentice astrologers Saleed has gone through, each one sent away for reasons unknown. Later on, Afsan, in a hurry to rendezvous with his mentor, unwittingly stumbles across a confrontation between Saleed and his old creche-mate, the master mariner Var-Keenir. Keenir has brought with him a new invention called a \\"Far-Seer\\". He offers it to Saleed in hopes that it would be useful in his work, but the old astrologer, set in his ways, haughtily refuses the offer. Afsan, however, is eager to use the Far-Seer to look at The Face of God (a mysterious object which hangs in the sky that the Quintaglios worship). Outraged and offended by the suggestion, Saleed berates Afsan and sends him to the palace Hall of Worship to pay penance for his blasphemy. After arriving at the hall of worship, Afsan runs into Det-Yenalb, Master of the Faith. The high priest notices Afsan's height and notes that he's old enough that he should have gone on his coming- of-age pilgrimage to see The Face of God. Yenalb recommends that Afsan go on a hunt first, as many are lost during the Pilgrimage and he has yet to earn his hunting tattoo; any Quintaglio who hasn't yet earned one will not be allowed into heaven. Afsan heeds Yenalb's advice and meets with his friend, Prince Dybo, who also has yet to go on his pilgrimage or earn a hunting tattoo. After sharing a cut of Hornface meat with Afsan and some words of encouragement from Pal-Cadool, the palace butcher, Dybo agrees to accompany Afsan on his pilgrimage and earn a hunting tattoo as well. Before leaving with Dybo, Afsan is summoned by Dybo's mother, Empress Len-Lends. Plainly exposing her claws in Afsan's view, she tells him that he is responsible for Dybo's safe return, or he will face punishment. Visibly shaken by the Empress's threat, Afsan leaves to go on his hunt with Dybo. Afsan and Dybo arrive at the Hunter's Shrine and join the pack of Jal-Tetex, the imperial hunt leader. During the hunt, they target a massive Thunderbeast, the biggest one ever seen. The pack fights a long and grueling battle against the monstrous sauropod, and Asfan kills it by climbing up its neck and ripping out its throat, jumping away at the last second to avoid getting crushed. Afsan is declared a hero, revered for showing such innate skill on his very first hunt. After returning from the hunt, Afsan and Dybo board the Dasheter, a sailing vessel which is commanded by none other than Var-Keenir. Keenir's tail is nothing but a stump, having been torn off in an encounter prior to the story with a sea monster he calls Kal-Ta-Goot. Keenir allows Afsan to borrow his Far-Seer, and Afsan uses it to study the heavens and The Face of God. The Dasheter sails across the ocean, and Afsan's careful observations of the stars have caused him to come to a shocking conclusion- the planets, which once appeared as distant points of light, looked the same as The Face of God, meaning it is merely a natural object, not the face of a deity. Furthermore, moons orbited these planets, and Afsan hypothesis that the Quintaglio's world, which has traditionally been thought of by the Quintaglios as a giant \\"boat\\" of land floating down a massive river, is actually a moon, covered by water and orbiting The Face of God. Afsan relays his discovery to captain Var-Keenir, and tries to convince him to keep sailing east in order to test his hypothesis. Keenir refuses to, stating that it's too much of a risk to sail into uncharted waters. However, Kal-Ta-Goot is spotted heading east, and Keenir, eager for vengeance, orders its pursuit. After following Kal-Ta-Goot for several weeks, the creature attacks the Dasheter. Several sailors are eaten in the resulting battle, but eventually, Afsan proves his hunting prowess once more, killing the serpent by strangling it with the ship's anchor. Grateful to Afsan for saving his life, Keenir allows Afsan to make a request. Afsan requests that the Dasheter stay on course, and Keenir obliges, much to the chagrin of priest Det-Bleen, and sailor Nor-Gampar. When Det-Bleen confronts Keenir, it is revealed that Keenir is a Lubalite- a member of a cult which was once the dominant religion prior to the prophet Larsk sailing across the ocean and discovering The Face of God. Not long after, while Afsan is explaining to Dybo why they are continuing to sail east despite having killed Kal-Ta-Goot, the two are approached by Nor- Gampar, who is in full dagamant, the animalistic rage which overtakes Quintaglios when forced into extended contact with each other. Gampar attacks Dybo, and Afsan tries to protect him, and all three are drawn into a dagamant- fueled fight to the death. Afsan manages to kill Gampar, and almost attacks Dybo before the dagamant wears off. The Dasheter continues to sail onward, eventually landing on the western edge of Land, just as Afsan had predicted it would. While the Dasheter has stopped for maintenance, Afsan and Dybo learn that Len-Lends, the Empress, was killed when an earthquake caused the ceiling of the palace to collapse on her. By inheritance, Prince Dybo is now Emperor Dy-Dybo, ruler of all the land. In view of this, Dybo must return to capital city immediately. Afsan bids him adieu, deciding to take a more leisurely route back to the capital. During his travels, Afsan decides to meet with Wab- Novato, the inventor of the Far-Seer. Afsan learns that she has also been observing the planets and the moons, and exchange knowledge. Together, they come to the conclusion that the rings surrounding certain planets are made up out of moons which orbit too close to large planets and break apart. This leads to an even more shocking conclusion: their world, which is a moon, is orbiting dangerously close to The Face of God, and will one day crumble into a ring as well. The mental stimulation of sharing their knowledge ignites their passion and culminates with an impulsive act of sexual intercourse between the two. The following morning, Novato gives Afsan one of her Far-Seers, and he leaves to continue his journey back to Capital City to share this knowledge with Emperor Dybo. Later, Afsan stops at his home-town of Pack Carno. Whilst there, he peeks in the Pack's nursery, and witnesses a shocking event: a male Quintaglio, garbed in a purple robe, chasing and devouring all but one of the hatchlings from an entire clutch of eggs. Afsan learns that this Quintaglio is what is known as a Hal-Pataars; a Bloodpriest. It has been their job since ancient times to control the Quintaglio population by culling all but the single strongest hatchlings from each clutch of eggs. Shaken by the event, he later wonders if the governors of the province- who all bear a resemblance to Len-Lends, the former Empress- were exempted from the culling of the Bloodpriests. Afsan continues his journey back to Capital city, accompanying a convoy from Pack Carno, and with them, kills a Fangjaw (a large, quadrupedal, saber-toothed theropod) from Runningbeast-back along the way. Eventually, he arrives back in Capital city, only to learn that Tak-Saleed had fallen ill while he was away. Afsan goes to visit his mentor at his sickbed, and tells him what he learned. Saleed confesses that he has known what Afsan knew all along, but kept it secret- he didn't want to risk losing his position, and was just too old to carry on the fight that would inevitably rise from this challenge to the Quintaglio's religion. Saleed knew that it would require an intelligent, youthful Quintaglio to fight this new fight. With his final breath, Saleed tells Afsan that the Quintaglios need to get off their world, and dies. Meanwhile, word has spread of Afsan's pilgrimage. Afsan is confronted by Gerth-Palsab, a belligerent, illiterate blacksmith, who accuses him of sacrilege. Afsan and Palsab engage in a debate, which draws a large crowd, many of whom are offended by Afsan's assertions, and others who are curious about them. Present in the crowd is a Junior Priest, who tells Det- Yenalb about Afsan's theory. Det-Yenalb, having heard rumours about Keenir, believes that the mariner has poisoned Afsan's mind with Lubalite blasphemy. When Afsan finally reunites with Dybo, he finds himself surrounded by Yenalb and the palace council. Yenalb tries to convince Afsan that he is mistaken. When he asserts that he isn't, Yenalb whips the council into a frenzy and persuades them into believing that Afsan is a Demon. Dybo, who has remained tactfully silent, saves Afsan from being killed on the spot by the council and orders him to be locked away in the palace basement. While Afsan is incarcerated, Pal-Cadool arrives to bring him meat. Cadool tells Afsan that Dybo is Emperor by divine right, being the descendant of the prophet Larsk- his theory cannot be made common knowledge or Dybo will have no right to rule. Afsan tells Cadool that the world is doomed, and he pledges himself to his cause. Cadool tells Afsan to trust nobody except those who can make a certain hand gesture; one Afsan has seen performed before by Keenir. Pal-Cadool meets with Jal-Tetex in secret at the hunter's shrine, where it is revealed that both are Lubalites, like Keenir. Cadool and Tetex both agree that Afsan is The One, a messiah foretold by the prophecy of Lubal. They believe Yenalb will have Afsan executed, and Tetex informs Cadool that Keenir has gone to recruit fellow Lubalites to rescue him. Meanwhile, Afsan is approached by Yenalb, who tries to coerce Afsan into recanting his claims. As an alternative to execution, he offers Afsan a contract, in which he declares to disavow his theories and acknowledge Larsk as a true prophet, and that he would live safely; in exile, cut off from the rest of the Quintaglios. Afsan is tempted by Yenalb's offer but ultimately refuses. He unsheathes his claws and tears up the document, and Yenalb storms off in a rage. As punishment for his heresy, Afsan has been brought to a podium in central square for a public discipline. At the request of Dybo, Afsan is not killed. Instead, Yenalb gouges out Afsan's eyes with a ceremonial obsidian dagger, so that he can no longer claim to see the things which blaspheme God. After this, Afsan is released, allowed to live out the rest of his life, but in shame and blindness. After his blinding, Afsan becomes good friends with Jal-Tetex and Pal-Cadool, who remain by his side and aide him in his blindness. Eventually, the Lubalites arrive, who march into the central square. Afsan, from atop the back of a Shovelmouth, speaks to the Lubalites, telling them of his theories and that the world is doomed. He pleads with them to cast aside their superstition and give themselves over to knowledge, to science and reason. It is only action- not prayer -which will get them off their world and save the Quintaglios. Afsan's plea is interrupted by Yenalb, atop the back of a Spikefrill and accompanied by the palace guard, who commands the Lubalites to clear out of the square. They refuse, and a fierce battle between the two factions ensues. Afsan is kept safe by the Lubalites during the conflict, and Cadool confronts Yenalb in combat atop the Spikefrill. Yenalb is no match for the butcher and Cadool emerges triumphant by biting off his head, killing him in Afsan's honor. The battle between the Lubalites and the palace guard is interrupted when an earthquake, triggered by the eruption of the nearby Ch'Mar volcanoes, destroys Capital City. Though many are killed in the eruption, many more manage to escape by boarding the Dasheter: among them, Afsan, Cadool, Tetex, Keenir, and Emperor Dybo. Afsan learns that Novato is on the Dasheter as well- with their eight children, who were spared the culling of the Bloodpriests, since no Bloodpriest would dare kill the offspring of The One. While he is resting on the Dasheter, Dybo confronts Afsan, and apologises for all the terrible things he went through, and for blinding him. Dybo acknowledges the truth of Afsan's theory, tells him that all charges will be lifted and that he will be appointed the Court Astrologer and live in peace in capital city. Afsan asks Dybo to pledge himself to what would come to be known as the Quintaglio Exodus. The story ends with Dybo announcing that the Quintaglios will be going to the stars. Major themes Far-Seer (and the rest of the Quintaglio Ascension) is highly allegorical. The character of Afsan parallels Galileo.Science Fiction Writer Robert J. Sawyer: Writing the Quintaglio Ascension Literary significance and criticism Far-Seer met with high critical acclaim, winning the Homer award for \\"Best Novel\\" during its original 1992 release.

Sawyer: Far-Seer and its social relevance.SFRA Review: \\"Exciting, amusing — [but] much more than an adventure tale. Crucial to the plot is Afsan's struggles to find the truth of his own destiny and his questioning of the role of science in countering religious dogma.\\" Far-Seer has been translated into numerous languages, and is also the only book in the Quintaglio Ascension to have been translated into Japanese. However, Far-Seer has received some negative criticism. Some reviewers have said that the Quintaglios act too human,Science Fiction Writer Robert J.

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1926 VFL Premiership team was Melbourne. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Gordon Coventry of Collingwood with 83 goals; a VFL record. * The winner of the 1926 Brownlow Medal was Ivor Warne-Smith of Melbourne with 9 votes. * North Melbourne took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1926. * The seconds premiership was won by . Carlton 14.11 (95) defeated 5.13 (43) in the challenge Grand Final, played as a curtain raiser to the firsts Grand Final on 9 October at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Notable events * In order to ensure that each team had nine home games in every season, the 17 game home-and-away season of 1925 was extended to 18 matches in 1926. * Following the retirement due to ill-health of Sir Baldwin Spencer, former Melbourne footballer, club doctor, and VFL delegate Dr. William C. McClelland became President of the VFL. He served from 1926 to 1956. * Halfway through the 1924 season, Carlton's champion Horrie Clover retired as a player due to a serious illness. He was subsequently appointed Secretary of the Carlton Club and, as well, he was made a member of the VFL's Umpire and permit Committee. By the start of 1926, Clover's health had improved to the extent that he resumed his career with Carlton, playing another 78 senior games from 1926 to 1931. Due to the perceived conflict of interest, he was made to resign from the VFL Committee. * As the players were walking off the field for their half-time break in the Preliminary Final, the Melbourne centreman Bob Corbett was viciously king-hit from behind, suffering a broken jaw; Essendon's Charlie May was subsequently suspended for all of 1927 for the incident. With no replacements allowed, Melbourne were forced to continue with 17 men and were gamely defending against the Essendon onslaught in the last quarter when, with only minutes to go in the match, a barely conscious Corbett staggered out onto the field with his head swathed in bandages, and took up his position in the centre, freeing up Ivor Warne-Smith to lead the Melbourne attack. In a mark of respect for Corbett's great courage, Essendon tough-man and rugged full-back Harry Hunter, who was racing up the ground towards the Essendon goals, saw a battered Corbett standing in his way. Under normal circumstances, Hunter, who was known to take no prisoners, would have run straight through Corbett; however, in what was described as an act of great chivalry by a sportsman and a gentleman, Hunter sidestepped Corbett, and delivered the ball down the ground through another avenue. Melbourne won 6.6 (42) to Essendon's 5.9 (39). The king-hit led to strong calls for substitute replacement players.Old Boy, \\"Football: Preliminary Final\\", The Argus, (Monday, 4 October 1926), p. 16.Football Incident: Corbett's Injury: C.

It is a result of crustal extension/stretching (extensional tectonics) of the lithosphere (crust and upper mantle) due to mantle upwelling, gravitational collapse, crustal thickening, or relaxation of confining stresses. Crustal extension causes the thinning and deformation of the upper crust in an orientation perpendicular to the direction of extension. As the plates pull apart, they thin allowing the hot mantle to rise close to the surface. When the crust is extended it fractures along a fault plane, creating a series of long parallel normal faults. Between these normal faults are blocks, which subside, get uplifted or tilted. This is known as block faulting. Basins are formed due to subsidence of a block, while the blocks adjacent to the subsidence gets uplifted creating ranges. Normal faults are on both sides of the blocks; creating alternating elevated or subsided blocks, otherwise known as horst and graben. Basins and ranges can also be formed by blocks that are tilted causing one side to subside while the other side gets uplifted. These only have one side with a normal fault, this is known as tilted block faulting. Extension causes the plate to stretch, fracture and thin. Mountains rise and valleys drop, over a long period of time creating what we see as basin and range topography. Clarence Dutton, an early pioneering geologist, described the basin and range topography of parallel mountains and valleys as \\"army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico.\\"  Types of faulting  = Symmetrical faulting: horst and graben = With crustal extension, a series of normal faults which occur in groups, form in close proximity and dipping in opposite directions. As the crust extends it fractures in series of fault planes, some blocks sink down due to gravity, creating long linear valleys or basins also known as grabens. While the blocks remaining up or uplifted produce mountains or ranges, also known as horsts. Fault scarps are exposed on the horst block and expose the footwall of the normal fault. This is a type of block faulting known as grabens and horsts. This basin and range topography is symmetrical having equal slopes on both sides of the valleys and mountain ranges. = Asymmetric faulting: tilted block faulting = Tilted block faulting, also known as half-graben or rotational block faulting, can also occur during extension. Large gently dipping normal faults, also known as detachment faults, acts as platform in which normal faulted blocks, tilt or slide along. However, instead of the whole block subsiding only one side if the block will slip along the detachment fault, tilting toward the fault plane. Again creating mountains (ranges) and valleys (basins). Many tilted slightly in one direction at their tops due to the motion of their bottoms along the main detachment fault. This basin and range topography has one steep side and the other is more gradual.  Mapping extension  One of the most studied basin and range topographies is the Basin and Range Province in the western United States, located between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. The extension of the province was believed to have begun in the late Cenozoic Era, roughly 20 Ma. During the 90s scientists used a network of Global Positioning System (GPS) to determine the velocity magnitude and vector orientations of the Basin and Range province. In the study by Thatcher et al. they discovered that most deformation was happening in the west, adjacent to the Sierra Nevada block and while less deformation was happening in the east. Because the extension of the basin and range hits the Sierra Nevada batholith, it essentially is hitting a solid wall, therefore the strain is transferred to smaller faults along the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada. That might account for the slight northwestern extension in the northern part of the Basin and Range province.

The study of transmedia storytelling—a concept introduced by Henry Jenkins, author of the seminal book Convergence Culture—is an emerging subject. Because of the nature of new media and different platforms, varying authors have different understandings of it. Jenkins states the term \\"transmedia\\" means \\"across media\\" and may be applied to superficially similar, but different phenomena. In particular, the concept of \\"transmedia storytelling\\" should not to be confused with traditional cross-platform, \\"transmedia\\" media franchises, or \\"media mixes\\". One example that Jenkins gives is of the media conglomerate DC Comics. This organization releases comic books before the release of its related films so the audience understands a character's backstory. Much of transmedia storytelling is not based on singular characters of plot lines, but rather focuses on larger complex worlds where multiple characters and plot lines can be sustained for a longer period of time. In addition, Jenkins focused on how transmedia extends to attract larger audiences. For example, DC Comics releases coloring books to attract younger audience members. Sometimes, audience members can feel as though some transmedia storylines have left gaps in the plot line or character development, so they begin another extension of transmedia storytelling, such as fan fiction. Transmedia storytelling exists in the form of transmedia narratives, which Kalinov and Markova define as: \\"a multimedia product which communicates its narrative through a multitude of integrated media channels\\". From a production standpoint, transmedia storytelling involves creating content that engages an audience using various techniques to permeate their daily lives. In order to achieve this engagement, a transmedia production will develop stories across multiple forms of media in order to deliver unique pieces of content in each channel. Importantly, these pieces of content are not only linked together (overtly or subtly), but are in narrative synchronization with each other. History Transmedia storytelling can be related to the concepts of semiotics and narratology. Semiotics is the \\"science of signs\\" and a discipline concerned with sense production and interpretation processes. Narratology looks at how structure and function factor into narrative with regards to its themes and symbols. Scolari goes on to show how semiotics and narratology are ways to analyze transmedia. Often the same text may create different kinds of implicit consumers. Transmedia storytelling is a narrative structure that breaks through both language (semiotics) and media (narratology). Some effective strategies in transmedia storytelling include producing a fresh perspective on the original material and its original context across a new form of media. Transmedia storytelling is how well a story is comprehended across media. An effective strategy of transmedia storytelling does not take a passive approach, instead engages with popular culture making a story its own and providing new context. When it comes to strict adaptation in transmedia storytelling which is translating one medium to another: a book becomes a film, a comic becomes a video game. There is also a history describing pure transmedia: the book is an exact prequel to the film, ending at the exact moment prior to the films beginning. The earliest example of this would be the Bible. During early ages when many people were illiterate, narratives were passed on verbally, through \\"live theatre\\" where they were acted out, or illustrations. The origins of the approach to disperse the content across various commodities and media is traced to the Japanese marketing strategy of media mix, originated in early 1960s.Steinberg, Marc, Anime's Media Mix: Franchising Toys and Characters in Japan. p. viHenry Jenkins, Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, p. 110 Some, however, have traced the roots to Pamela: Or, Virtue Rewarded (1740) written by Samuel Richardson and even suggest that they go back further to the roots of earliest literature.Prior, Karen Swallow, The New, Old Way to Tell Stories: With Input From the Audience, The Atlantic, October 18, 2013 By the 1970s and 1980s, pioneering artists of telematic art made experiments of collective narrative, mixing the ancestors of today's networks, and produced both visions and critical theories of what became transmedia. With the advent of mainstream Internet usage in the 1990s, numerous creators began to explore ways to tell stories and entertain audiences using new platforms. Many early examples took the form of what was to become known as alternate reality games (ARG), which took place in real-time with a mass audience. The term ARG was itself coined in 2001 to describe The Beast, a marketing campaign for the film A.I.: Artificial Intelligence. Some early works include, but are not limited to: * Ong's Hat was most likely started sometime around 1993, and also included most of the aforementioned design principles. Ong's Hat also incorporated elements of legend tripping into its design, as chronicled in a scholarly work titled Legend-Tripping Online: Supernatural Folklore and the Search for Ong's Hat. Kinsella, Michael. Legend- Tripping Online: Supernatural Folklore and the Search for Ong's Hat University Press of Mississippi, 2011 * Dreadnot, an early example of an ARG-style project, was published on sfgate.com in 1996. This ARG included working voice mail phone numbers for characters, clues in the source code, character email addresses, off-site websites, and real locations in San Francisco. * Harry Potter Franchise (1997 - present) Best selling book series spawns films, officially developed immersive fan sites, social media, video games, off- Broadway stage plays and spin-off films (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindlewald) *Star Wars *Star Trek *The Matrix – feature film, 1999 * The Blair Witch Project – feature film, 1999 * On Line – feature film, 2001 * The Beast – game, 2001 * Majestic – video game, 2001 *Avatar – feature film, 2009 *Lost – TV series, 2004-2010 *Disney *Marvel Comics *DC Comics These examples were successful because of the impact their multi-platform storytelling became. Star Wars is one of the most extensive because its world is built across a multitude of platforms. The Blair Witch Project is impactful with their multi-platform storytelling because their online marketing campaign marks the first use of web storytelling. The Disney empire needs to be mentioned because much of the Disney \\"formula\\" for youth products: this tends to be straddle the nonexistent line between adaptation and TM storytelling but their franchise approach floods the market with multimedia examples. Many comics from the MCU or DC Universe that have been adapted to video games, feature films, animated shorts, comic book, etc.: Superman, Spiderman, Avengers (origin stories, sequels, spinoffs) have been successful. Current state Both traditional and dedicated transmedia entertainment studios have fully integrated and embraced transmedia storytelling techniques into entertainment culture. It began as a search for a new storytelling form, native to digital content and communications channels. Developing technologies have enabled projects to include single-player experiences in addition to real-time multiplayer experiences such as alternate reality games such as Fortnite. While the list of current and recent projects is too extensive to list here, some notable examples of transmedia storytelling include: * Slide, a native transmedia experience for Fox8 TV in Australia. * Skins, a transmedia extension of the Channel 4/Company Pictures TV show by Somethin' Else in the UK. * Halo, a video game series created by Bungie and currently developed by 343 Industries that has evolved to include novels, comic books, audio plays, live action web series and an upcoming live action television series from Showtime. * ReGenesis, a Canadian television series with a real-time transmedia (alternate reality game) extension that took place in sync with the episodes as they aired. * The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, a web series adaptation of Pride and Prejudice with Twitter and Tumblr accounts. * JFH: Justice For Hire from Creative Impulse Entertainment, a martial arts-themed transmedia comic book series created by Jan Lucanus that integrates live action films, a web series, animation, and music to tell stories across a universe timeline. * MyMusic, transmedia sitcom by Fine Brothers Productions as part of YouTube's original channels initiative, one of the more robust transmedia experiences. * Clockwork Watch, an independent project about a non-colonial steampunk world, told across graphic novels, live events, online and a feature film created by Yomi Ayeni. * Defiance, a television show and video game paired to tell connective and separate stories. * The HIVE Transmedia Project, by Daniel D.W. is a sci-fi novella series incorporating QR codes within the text to multimedia and a simulated reality story. * Check, Please! by Ngozi Ukazu is an ongoing webcomic since 2013. The narrative is supplemented with a Twitter account of the main protagonist. * Endgame: Proving Ground, a web, phone, book, movie and live paid actor campaign of transreality gaming by Niantic Labs beginning in 2014. * The Man with the Jazz Guitar creates the portrait of jazz musician Ken Sykora, across music, film, radio, print and digital. *Pokemon, There are video games, television shows, and card games all that use Pokemon as a center and point of entry. There is no one text that is the origination of the Pokemon series. *24, American television series (2001-2010) *The Hunger Games, a young adult book series adapted to wildly popular movies and fan fiction based on the character plot lines Scolari uses the example of 24 to show how transmedia storytelling occurs. 24 originated on Fox as a TV series but within a few years, it had generated a complex network of comics, video games, books, mobile episodes, etc. around the main character Jack Bauer and the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU). Scolari writes that 24 creates a complex semiotic device for generating multiple implicit consumers who can be classified according to their relationship with the media. At the first level, there are single text consumers or those who just read the comic or play the video game. The consumer can understand the story without having to consume the rest of the texts. On a second level, 24 constructs different single media consumers. Here a viewer can enter the narrative world by watching the TV series every week. Finally, 24 created transmedia consumers because there are different media across different platforms that the consumer can enter into. In \\"Digital State: How the internet is changing everything\\" (2013), author Simon Pont argues that transmedia storytelling is a theory that is at last starting to find its practical stride. Pont cites Ridley Scott's Alien prequel Prometheus (2012), and specifically the three viral films produced by 20th Century Fox as part of the advance global marketing campaign, as vivid executional examples of transmedia storytelling theory. Where Robert McKee (Story, 1998) argues that back-story is a waste of time (because if the back-story is so good then this is surely the story worth telling), Pont proposes that storytellers like J. J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof have \\"pretty much lined McKee's argument up against a wall and shot it\\".Pont, S. \\"Digital State: How the Internet is Changing Everything\\" (2013) Kogan Page . Pont goes on to argue, \\"Parallel and non-linear timelines, 'multi-verses', grand narratives with crazy-rich character arcs, 'back-story' has become 'more story', the opportunity to add Byzantine layers of meaning and depth. You don't create a story world by stripping away, but by layering\\". In \\"Ball & Flint: transmedia in 90 seconds\\" (2013), Pont likens transmedia story-telling to \\"throwing a piece of flint at an old stone wall\\" and \\"delighting in the ricochet\\", making story something you can now \\"be hit by and cut by\\".'Ball & Flint: transmedia explained in 90 seconds' (2013) Simon Pont Shannon Emerson writes in the blog post \\"Great Examples of Multiplatform Storytelling\\" that transmedia storytelling can also be called multiplatform storytelling, transmedia narrative, and even cross-media seriality. She also cites Henry Jenkins as a leading scholar in this realm.https://www.echostories.com/great- examples-multiplatform-storytelling/ Educational uses Transmedia storytelling mimics daily life, making it a strong constructivist pedagogical tool for educational uses.Jenkins, H. \\"Transmedia Storytelling and Entertainment: An Annotated Syllabus\\", Continuum: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies, 24:6, 943-958 2010. The level of engagement offered by transmedia storytelling is essential to the Me or Millennial Generation as no single media satisfy curiosity.Wilson, M. E. (2004). Teaching, learning, and millennial students. New directions for student services (106). Summer 2004. Schools have been slow to adopt the emergence of this new culture which shifts the spotlight of literacy from being one of individual expression to one of community. Whether we see it or not, Jenkins notes that we live in a globally connected world in which we use multiple platforms to connect and communicate. Using transmedia storytelling as a pedagogical tool, wherein students interact with platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or Tumblr permits students' viewpoints, experiences, and resources to establish a shared collective intelligence that is enticing, engaging, and immersive, catching the millennial learners' attention, ensuring learners a stake in the experience.Warren, S., Wakefield, J.S., and Mills, L. \\"Learning and Teaching as Communicative Actions: Transmedia Storytelling\\", in Laura A. Wankel, Patrick Blessinger (ed.) Increasing Student Engagement and Retention using Multimedia Technologies: Video Annotation, Multimedia Applications, Videoconferencing and Transmedia Storytelling (Cutting-edge Technologies in Higher Education, Volume 6), 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited, pp.67-94 Transmedia storytelling offers the educator the ability to lead students to think critically, identify with the material and gain knowledge, offering valuable framework for the constructivist educational pedagogy that supports student centered learning.Teske, Paul R. J. and Horstman, Theresa. \\"Transmedia in the classroom: breaking the fourth wall\\". Paper presented at the meeting of the MindTrek, 2012. Transmedia storytelling allows for the interpretation of the story from the individual perspective, making way for personalized meaning-making. In \\"The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy\\" (2012), Pont explains, \\"Transmedia thinking anchors itself to the world of story, the ambition principally being one of how you can 'bring story to life' in different places, in a non-linear fashion. The marketing of movies is the most obvious applications of thie concept. Transmedia maintains that there's a 'bigger picture opportunity' to punting a big picture to additional platforms. Transmedia theory, applied to a movie launch, is all about promoting the story, not the 'premiere date of a movie starring...' In an industry built on the conventions of 'stars sell movies', where their name sits above the film's title, transmedia thinking is anti-conventional and boldly purist.\\"Pont, S. \\"The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy\\" (2013) Kogan Page 978-0749466213. Transmedia storytelling is also used by companies like Microsoft and Kimberly-Clark to train employees and managers. Gronstedt and Ramos argues: \\"At the core of every training challenge is a good story waiting to be told. More and more, these stories are being told across a multitude of devices and screens, where they can reach learners more widely, and engage with them more deeply.\\" However, transmedia storytelling isn't used much at lower education levels. Children would thrive using transmedia storytelling worlds in their learning, but many of these worlds have copyrights linked to them. Transmedia storytelling has yet to tackle learning and educating children, but there have been a few transmedia worlds that have begun to show up with education, mostly by Disney. Transmedia storytelling is apparent in comics, films, print media, radio, and now social media. The story is told different depending on the medium. With social media, the story is told differently depending on which social media platform someone uses (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) The scale in which the impact each medium has differs from medium to medium. Before social media, radio and print media were the primary medium to connect with an audience. With the advancements in technology, social media has become the go-to medium to reach a large group of people in a fast amount of time. In the ideal form of TS, “each medium does what it does best — so that a story might be introduced in a film, expanded through television, novels, and comics, and its world might be explored and experienced through game play. Each franchise entry needs to be self-contained enough to enable autonomous consumption. That is, you don't need to have seen the film to enjoy the game and vice-versa.” For the purpose of studying transmedia storytelling and how information becomes spreadable across multiple media platforms, we can look at four strategies for expanding the narrative world of media texts. First is the creation of interstitial microstories. Examples of these are video games, online clips, or comics. Next is the creation of parallel stories. Here, the idea is to create another story that unfolds at the same time as the macrostory. Scolari uses the example of the episode \\"24: Conspiracy\\". Third, the creation of peripheral stories is considered spin-offs from the original stories. The example of 24 novels is used to show how texts have a weak relationship to the macrostory, but still connected to it. The final strategy is user-generated content platforms like blogs or wikis. These environments are open source story-creation machines that allow users to add to the fictional world. This could also be called fan fiction. Each medium reaches a different audience. Traditional mediums such as radio, print media, and film, garner older audiences because of the familiarity of that generation with those specific mediums. Scolari uses the example of Shrek. It is a film for kids, but some of the dialogue contains jokes that are meant for adults. Thus, the same text is creating at least two groups of consumers - children and adults or parents. The millennial generation uses a combination of mediums because there awareness of traditional media and the advancements of social media. The Gen Z audience is drawn to the social media medium similar to the reason to the Gen X audience is drawn to traditional mediums, because of the familiarity of the medium.

Motion platforms used in \\"Level D\\" Full flight simulators (FFS) and equivalent military simulators have six jacks that can move the replica cockpit that is mounted on the platform in any of the six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) that can be experienced by any body free to move in space. These are the three rotations Pitch, Roll and Yaw, and three linear movements Heave (up and down), Sway (side to side) and Surge (fore and aft). The jack layout used is generally that of the so-called Stewart platform, shown in a moving picture on the left and on which the simulator cabin will be mounted. Acceleration onset cueing works in three phases: # The initial acceleration of the vehicle being simulated is replicated closely by the platform. However, the platform jacks cannot go on moving without reaching their \\"limit stops\\" and a technique is used that prevents the stops being reached without being discernible to the simulator crew. # After the above initial acceleration, the jack movement is gradually decreased, eventually to zero (this is known as the washout phase). # Finally, the motion platform is reset to the neutral position but at a rate below that of the sensory threshold of the simulator crew. The various human body motion-sensors react to accelerations rather than steady-state motions and have thresholds below which they do not transmit signals to the brain (the latter explains why instruments are needed for safe cloud flying). Furthermore, impulses from the set of body motion sensors are processed by the brain in a timescale of milliseconds compared to longer time intervals for visual cues of the Outside World (OTW) to be registered by the brain. The body motion-sensors include the inner-ear sensors, (semicircular canals and otoliths, the \\"Vestibular sensors\\"), the muscle-and joint sensors, and sensors that register movements and pressures on body parts such as arms, legs and buttocks. In the real world the brain is (subconsciously) expecting to receive the above motion cues before later registering the associated change in the visual scene. In a simulator, if motion cues are not present to back up visual cues, disorientation can result (\\"simulator sickness\\") due to the cue- mismatch compared to the real world. The above way the body signals motion to the brain coincides very well with acceleration-onset cueing in a simulator. This is the reason why well-designed and properly set-up modern low-latency motion platforms in simulators work well for all aircraft from large transports to the low-G envelope of fighter aircraft. Because fighter aircraft are capable of high-G, which cannot be modelled by a 6-jack motion platform, the majority of fighter simulators are not equipped with motion platforms.(source: http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1989-3272) In contrast, civil airliner Full Flight Simulators to the international Level D/Type 7 standard must have a 6-axis platform, and many military simulators for large aircraft and helicopters follow the civil Level D/Type 7 design.

It was built in the Anatra factory in Odessa in the Russian Empire and flown during World War I by both sides during the Russian Civil War. The main difference from the previous model was the replacement of a 100 hp rotary engine with a much more powerful 150 hp Salmson radial engine, which improved performance. The engine was unusual, being one of the few water-cooled radial engines, hence the plane had a water radiator in front of the upper wing. This engine was license-built in Russia. The forward fuselage was similar to its predecessor, with a partial engine cowling, open at the bottom, with characteristic holes. The plane was also slightly larger and more heavily armed, adding a synchronised forward-firing machine gun for the pilot in addition to the observer's weapon. The plane, named Anasal (short for Anatra Salmson) was first flown on 7 August 1916Andrzej Kiński, Tomasz J. Kopański: Anatra Anasal in Lotnictwo Wojskowe 2/1999, ISSN 1505-1196, p. 56-60 (in Polish) (25 July 1916 old style). The first orders came only in 1917, and before the Soviet revolution in November 1917 some 60 to 70 had been manufactured, many others being in different stages of completion. Many details differed between individual aircraft. In March 1918 Odessa was occupied by Austro-Hungarian forces, in accordance with the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk and in May the Austrian government ordered 200 Anasals, as the Anatra C.I, for training and observation. 114 were received by the Austrians by September 1918, some half being given to training units before the end of World War I. In October, the remainder of the order was cancelled. The major postwar user of the Anasal was Czechoslovakia, with 23 former Austrian aircraft, used by the military, and later in civilian aviation. One of these has survived and is in the Prague Aviation Museum, Kbely. Eight Anasals were used by revolutionary forces in Hungary. Eight aircraft were acquired in March 1919 by the Polish 4th Rifle Division in Odessa, fighting in the Russian civil war on the White side, but only four were assembled and used until April. Another Anasal was captured and used by the Poles during the Polish-Soviet war in 1919–20. A more advanced model was the Anatra DSS, with 160 hp Salmson engine, but few were made.

It tells the story of Sheriff Henry Tawes (Peck) who develops a relationship with a girl in town, Alma McCain (Weld). The screenplay, written by Alvin Sargent, is an adaptation of Madison Jones' novel An Exile. The I Walk the Line soundtrack is by Johnny Cash; it features his 1956 hit song of the same name. The movie was filmed on location in Gainesboro, Jackson County, Tennessee and Center Hill Lake and Dam in Central Tennessee. Plot Henry Tawes is an aging sheriff in small-town of Gainesboro, Tennessee, who is becoming bored with his wife, Ellen, and his life. He meets young Alma McCain, oldest daughter and de facto housewife of a poor family led by her single parent father. Her age is ambiguous, but she is clearly far younger than Henry. Henry and Alma become romantically and physically involved, meeting secretly at various points around their town, particularly an abandoned house. Her family quickly learns and is very accepting of the relationship, appearing also to take his forceful advice to destroy their still and all evidence it had existed before a visiting excise official named Bascomb returns and is likely to find it. Henry Tawes clearly doesn't see harm in the manufacture of moonshine but needs to balance his personal views and his role as county sheriff. The couple start to discuss running away together. A deputy, Hunnicutt, starts taking an active interest in the McCains, ignoring warnings from Tawes to leave them alone. Henry's wife also starts to suspect that he is having an affair and confronts him about it, although she is apparently more concerned about pleasing him and protecting her family than his obvious infidelities. Against this background, Bascomb returns to the town and organizes a systematic search of the county, with the McCains being a family of particular interest because of prior history of the father; Henry also learns from him that Alma is married, her husband being in prison; at their next meeting he becomes angry with her about the fact she hadn't told him, but then they make love and he proposes that they run away together. She is reluctant, fearing the response of her family, but they arrange to meet and leave for California early the next day. In the meantime, however, Deputy Hunicutt visits the McCain family, clearly looking for an illegal still, where he meets Alma. After an argument, the deputy draws his weapon and shoots dead the family dog in front of her, an act witnessed from a distance by her father and brothers. The film cuts forward to scenes of Sheriff Henry Tawes being informed that his deputy is missing and the McCain family frantically packing up their still. Tawes visits the McCain family to find them disposing of Hunicutt's body. He tells them to \\"clear out\\", and with them gone, disposes of the deputy's body himself by weighting it and dropping it into a nearby reservoir. As he returns from disposing the deputy's body, he is met by Bascomb, who has found the remains of the McCains still. Believing she isn't with her family, Henry starts searching frantically for Alma as soon as he can. Unable to find her, he pursues the McCain family out of the county, finding her with them; he ends up fighting with her father and brother, shooting her father, but Alma attacks him with a farmer's hook. Neither injury is fatal. Leaving him in the road, alive and conscious but badly injured, the McCains drive off. Cast * Gregory Peck as Sheriff Tawes * Tuesday Weld as Alma McCain * Estelle Parsons as Ellen * Ralph Meeker as Carl McCain * Lonny Chapman as Bascomb * Charles Durning as Hunnicutt * Jeff Dalton as Clay McCain * Freddie McCloud as Buddy McCain * Jane Rose as Elsie * J.C. Evans as Grandpa Tawes * Margaret A. Morris as Sybil * Bill Littleton as Pollard * Leo Yates as Vogel * Nora Denney as Darlene Hunnicutt (as Dodo Denney) Pre-production Frankenheimer wanted Gene Hackman to play the sheriff, but Columbia Pictures insisted that Peck be cast in the lead since he was under contract to them. Frankenheimer cast J.C. Evans, his wife's grandfather, who was eighty-two years old, to play the sheriff's father; the director called Evans \\"quite wonderful\\" but eventually had Will Geer dub his part. During the drive-in scene, the film playing is The Big Mouth, but the posters at the theater list it as Hook, Line & Sinker (both were Jerry Lewis movies). When Sony released it on DVD in 2006, the final shot was altered to show a freeze-frame of Peck's face. In the original version, Peck's face is never frozen, and his eyes are open. The scene showing Ralph Meeker's character shooting Charles Durning's deputy sheriff character from a distance with a rifle to protect his daughter is deleted in the video release. Reception In a December 1970 review, Time magazine summarized the film's main characters: * \\"Tuesday Weld is an understandably desirable love object, a genuine Lolita, but she can make little sense of her rather muddy character\\" * \\"Ralph Meeker, as the ruthless moonshiner, is all sinister smiles and barely repressed violence\\" * \\"(Gregory) Peck succeeds in conveying the sheriff's vulnerability but never his passion\\" According to TV Guide, \\"[t]he one reason to watch is the astonishing, unsung Weld, the modern Louise Brooks, who can suggest amorality, skewed innocence and ageless sensuality--she played nymphets through her thirties with infinite ease--that makes Bardot pale.\\" In an interview published in October 2009, Madison Jones, the author upon whose novel the film's screenplay was based, said Peck \\"didn’t really fit the role.... He didn’t really fit any role unless he is playing himself.\\" According to Jones, \\"Peck himself said there was a good movie lying on the cutting-room floor.\\" Soundtrack album Cash re- recorded the title song for the film, and ended up with enough material for a soundtrack album. One of the songs, \\"Flesh and Blood,\\" even became a number one country hit in 1971. The soundtrack featured three songs not heard in the film (\\"This Town\\", \\"Face of Despair\\" and \\"The World's gonna Fall On You\\").

The pilots targeted the Independence Palace, the official residence of the President of South Vietnam, with the aim of assassinating President Ngô Đình Diệm and his immediate family, who acted as his political advisors. The pilots later said they attempted the assassination in response to Diệm's autocratic rule, in which he focused more on remaining in power than on confronting the Vietcong, a Marxist–Leninist guerilla army who were threatening to overthrow the South Vietnamese government. Cử and Quốc hoped that the airstrike would expose Diệm's vulnerability and trigger a general uprising, but this failed to materialise. One bomb penetrated a room in the western wing where Diệm was reading but failed to detonate, leading the president to claim that he had \\"divine\\" protection. With the exception of Diệm's sister-in-law Madame Nhu, who suffered minor injuries, the Ngô family were unscathed. Three palace staff died and 30 were injured. Afterwards, Cử escaped to Cambodia, but Quốc was arrested and imprisoned. In the wake of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American presence in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam; in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.Karnow, pp. 280–281.Tucker, p. 302.Langguth, pp. 163–164. Planning An A-1 Skyraider, similar in model to the aircraft used in the attack Cử was the second son of Nguyễn Văn Lực, a leader of the VNQDD (), which opposed the Diệm regime. In 1960, Diệm had jailed Lực for one month for engaging in \\"anti-government activities\\". The VNQDD planned that Cử and Quốc, another pilot from the same squadron, would attack the Independence Palace on 27 February. Quốc had recently been personally commended by Diệm for his achievements in combat, having been honoured as one of the best pilots in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF). Quốc had relatives who were involved with the VNQDD. Cử recruited Quốc by claiming the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces and the United States were aware of the plot, showing him a Newsweek article critical of Diệm as evidence.Langguth, p. 99. Quốc had more subordinates but was not sure of their loyalty, so he did not try to recruit them for the attack on the palace. Years later, Cử blamed Diệm's treatment of opposition parties as the motivation for his attack. He believed that Diệm had prioritised remaining in power over fighting the VC and that, for six years, Cử had been denied promotion because of Diệm's obsession with hindering political opponents. Cử criticised the Americans for having supported Diệm, saying: \\"the Americans had slammed the door on those of us who really wanted the fight against the communists\\". Attack Quốc and Cử, who were trained in France and the United States, respectively, were given orders to fly their A-1H/AD-6 Skyraider ground attack planes from Bien Hoa Air Base outside Saigon to the Mekong Delta in an early morning mission against the VC. The VC had been involved in attacks on Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units south of the capital and had inflicted heavy damage. Instead of proceeding south from Bien Hoa Air Base as ordered, they changed course to attack the Independence Palace, the official presidential residence. This meant that two companies of VC guerrillas were able to retreat after their attack without counter-attack. At around 07:00, the deer on the expansive lawns of the French colonial-era palace were frightened off as Quốc and Cử's planes flew low over their target to inspect the ruling family's residence. On their second run, they attacked with bombs and napalm before strafing the presidential compound with rocket and machine-gun fire. The duo continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and fought back. Taking advantage of poor weather and low cloud cover, the two pilots circled the palace at altitudes of around , periodically diving out of the clouds to re-attack before darting back into them. The airstrike caught the Presidential Guard by surprise and, in the confusion, they were unable to determine whether the aircraft were acting alone or with ground forces. Loyalist tanks and armoured personnel carriers rushed to their battle stations and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, nearly hitting the loyalist aircraft from Bien Hoa Air Base in pursuit of the two rebel planes. Two tanks and a number of jeeps armed with .50-calibre machine guns patrolled the smoke-filled streets as a precaution.Jones, pp. 162–163.

To the right is a taller, older man in a dark suit, striped tie and light shirt who is turning his head to the left, talking to her. A man in a suit is visible, standing in the background. The first bomb penetrated a room in the western wing where Diệm was reading a biography of George Washington. The bomb failed to detonate, which gave Diệm enough time to seek shelter in a cellar in the eastern wing. He was joined there by his elder brother Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu, Madame Nhu—who sustained an arm fracture while running toward the cellar—and their children. Elsewhere within the palace, three servants and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop where he had been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and although they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions. Quốc's aircraft was damaged by fire from a minesweeper, forcing him to eject over the Saigon River and land in Nhà Bè, suffering minor facial injuries in the landing. He was arrested by a nearby naval patrol, and before being taken away for interrogation reportedly asked, \\"did I kill that filthy character?\\" Cử believed the attack had been successful and managed to safely flee to Cambodia. Commenting on the attack, a US Air Force officer opined: \\"with that weather, they did a hell of a job\\". Aftermath In a brief radio address after order had been restored, Diệm dismissed the attack as an \\"isolated act\\" and attributed his escape to \\"divine protection\\". He visited the soldiers wounded in the attacks, and also promised the rebel pilots' colleagues that they would not bear any responsibility for the bombing. American President John F. Kennedy promptly sent a message denouncing the attack as a \\"destructive and vicious act\\", and expressed relief that Diệm was \\"safe and unharmed\\". US ambassador Frederick Nolting determined that the attack had been the result of \\"two isolated cases\\" and opined that the incident did not represent widespread dissatisfaction with the regime. The absence of a VC reaction led Nolting to label the bombing as a \\"limited scope, anti-Communist assassination attempt\\". Diệm was praised for outwardly projecting a calm demeanour following the attack, and he moved to temporary government accommodation usually used for foreign dignitaries and visited Bien Hoa Air Base. The National Assembly, Diệm's rubber stamp legislative body, urged the president to \\"take drastic measures against irresponsible elements\\". The day after the attack, the National Assembly's Steering Committee passed a resolution calling on Diệm to end \\"the policy of clemency\\" against dissidents and to \\"continue the struggle to protect the nation's destiny\\". They also called for punishments to be handed out to people who took advantage of the disorder by hoarding goods or speculating on food. General Duong Van Minh, the presidential military advisor, attributed the assault to \\"disgruntled pilots\\", and noted that no hostile troop movements had occurred.Hammer, p. 137. The Civil Guard had remained loyal and its commander ordered his airborne forces to take over Tan Son Nhut Air Base. A spokesperson for Diệm also denied that napalm had been used against the palace. This was widely believed to be due to the fact that the government was sensitive to the ramifications of the RVNAF being revealed to have such weapons in their stocks. He claimed the situation was under \\"complete control\\". The RVNAF reacted to the two pilots' actions by sending a resolution to Diệm, saying that the attack was an \\"absolutely isolated and foolish\\" event that \\"impaired the prestige of the air force\\" and was \\"detrimental to the national effort in the present struggle and is profitable to the Communists in their work of subversion\\". The RVNAF was regarded as being a highly loyal branch of the armed forces and its commander, Colonel Nguyen Quang Vinh had claimed the year before, that all of the RVNAF's officer corps had voted for Diem in the 1961 presidential election. Upon hearing of the attack, Vinh who had been in Taiwan attending a conference boarded a specially chartered airplane provided by Taiwanese President Chiang Kai-shek of Taiwan, to return to Saigon to make a statement on the situation and the political reliability of the RVNAF. The National Revolutionary Movement, an organization used by the Ngô family to stage orchestrated mass demonstrations in support of themselves, called for the death penalty against the two pilots and further asked Diệm to enact the \\"strictest measures to insure discipline in the military\\". The Director General of Information released a statement calling for the \\"complete crushing\\" of \\"reactionaries\\" as well as communists. It referred to the attack as an \\"odious attempt against the lives of the President of the Republic and his family\\" and went on to disseminate an official version of the events of February 27, noting that \\"rumours have been running pertaining to the fate of Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu, who, with her family, as everyone knows, is a favorite target of the propaganda of reactionaries and Communists\\". The press release went on to describe the two rebel pilots as \\"ignominious people in the pay of the enemies of the Vietnamese people\\" and also assailed the foreign media, saying that \\"certain sections of the press of the world have given their support\\" to \\"reactionary and Communist propaganda\\". It concluded by saying \\"These developments clearly show that the leaders in their palace are sharing the fighting life of the people at the front. They confirm that in this battle to the end instigated by reactionaries and Communists against free Vietnam, there is no other duty for the people than to fight until the complete crushing of all their enemies is achieved. As a result of the attack, Diệm ordered that all RVNAF aircraft be grounded and all aerial combat missions were suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, it was deemed too risky for American helicopters to operate in the jungles against the VC. On 2 March, three days after the attack, Diệm allowed the air force to resume combat operations, having concluded that Cử and Quốc's sentiments were not representative of the air force. For a few days after the attack, the areas around the palace were cordoned off and tanks were stationed at prominent streets in the capital. Quốc was imprisoned for his actions, while Cử remained in exile in Cambodia where he worked as a language teacher. Cử told reporters in Cambodia that he was a nationalist, not a communist and predicted that attacks against the ruling family would continue. Cử cited the policies of the regime, rather than the president as a person, as the motivation for his attack. He said that \\"It is less Ngo Dinh Diem—sometimes well intentioned toward the population—than his family and supporters, who are hated by the army and the population\\". Diệm asked Cambodia to extradite Cử, but this request was refused. Cambodia's Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Diệm had extremely hostile relations, and the Ngô family had tried to depose him in the past by funding coup attempts. In 1959, Nhu tried to assassinate Sihanouk by sending him a parcel bomb.Osborne, pp. 106–112. As a result, Sihanouk routinely gave asylum to political refugees who had tried to depose or kill Diệm. In November 1960, he had given asylum to a group of paratroopers who tried to depose Diệm.Hammer, pp. 128–132. In the meantime, Diệm's police sought to track down Cử's father, who had gone into hiding following the assassination attempt. After Diệm's assassination in November 1963, Quốc was released from prison and Cử returned from exile on 16 November, and they resumed their service in the RVNAF. Quốc advanced to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 18 months before being killed in an air raid over North Vietnam on 20 April 1965. =Diệm reaction= alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. On 4 March, Diệm held a review of the RVNAF in central Saigon. Large crowds flocked to the banks of the Saigon River to watch formations of RVNAF aircraft on aerial parade, although everyday civilians were not allowed within a block of the presidential box, where Diệm was accompanied by Nolting and General Paul D. Harkins, commander of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam . The display included 29 of the A-1 aircraft used to attack Independence Palace. Diệm spoke about the events of 27 February and noted that he was \\"not unaware\\" of the supportive reaction of the various segments of society to \\"the foolish act perpetrated by some treacherous elements\\" that had \\"tried to rouse bloody troubles which would have profited only enemies of the fatherland\\". He said that the bombing was \\"merely an isolated action off a few insane traitors to the fatherland and to the people, while the entire air force, like the rest of the armed forces, demonstrated unfaltering loyalty and an unwavering spirit of national unity by rapidly and effectively countering the aggression of two criminals\\". He described that attack as \\"the odious act of renegades\\" and called upon the RVNAF \\"to remain always vigilant, to turn away from all temptations, to scorn all perfidious schemes and to place the higher interest of the fatherland above personal interest\\". In response, the RVNAF chief Vinh, asked Diệm for \\"forgiveness and clemency\\" and presented a plaque inscribed with a resolution from the RVNAF condemning attack. During Nolting's first meeting with Diệm after the assassination attempt, the president adamantly asserted that the media was responsible for the bombing. He pointed to the Newsweek article and other \\"derogatory articles in the press\\", using them to justify his claim that \\"the Americans were supporting the revolution\\". Diệm declared that while some journalists were portraying the bombing as a wake-up call he saw it as \\"a warning to them—an indicator of the danger of their irresponsibility in fomenting disorder\\".Jacobs, pp. 131–132. In a later meeting with General Harkins, Diệm joked: \\"I shouldn't have put him in the air force, because I had put his father in jail years ago\\". Diệm went on to predict that \\"sometime I'm going to get shot right in the back of the neck. Sometime they'll get me that way\\". (He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the November 1963 coup.) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press.Tucker, p. 405. Off the record, one official admitted that \\"We don't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more ... Diệm had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy\\". Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that \\"There's always going to be an opposition. If we take these people in, there will be another opposition springing up, because they are controversial men.\\" Madame Nhu added, \\"You open a window to let in light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don't want to be exploited by it.\\"Warner, p. 92. =U.S. reaction= The attack generated speculation that the US would respond by deploying combat troops in South Vietnam. At that time, US military personnel officially held only advisory capacities. In the response to media concerns about the stability of the Diệm government, US Secretary of State Dean Rusk denied that the US had plans to deploy combat forces. He also ruled out negotiations with the VC, saying \\"the root of the trouble\\" was communist violations of the Geneva Accords. United States Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith lobbied Kennedy against the deployment of combat troops, believing that it would lead to endless South Vietnamese requests for more troops. Galbraith further believed that wasting US resources in the jungles of Vietnam would be playing into the hands of the Soviet Union. According to one US observer, the palace bombing provoked \\"full scale plotting against Diệm\\". Galbraith noted that \\"When the man in power is on the way down, anything is better\\" and considered that any change in South Vietnamese leadership would bring an improvement.

Along with the German known as Georgius Agricola, de Boodt was responsible for establishing modern mineralogy. De Boodt was an avid mineral collector who travelled widely to various mining regions in Germany, Bohemia and Silesia to collect samples. His definitive work on the subject was the Gemmarum et Lapidum Historia (1609). De Boodt was also a gifted draughtsman who made many natural history illustrations and developed a natural history taxonomy. Early life De Boodt descended from an aristocratic family. His ancestors had come from Dortrecht in the 13th century. His father Anselmus de Boodt (1519-1587) was a renowned broker who also provided overseas insurance coverage.Marie-Christiane De Boodt-Maselis, Anselmus Boetius De Boodt (1550-1632), Brugs humanist aan het Hof van Oostenrijk Vlaanderen in: Jaargang 51. Christelijk Vlaams Kunstenaarsverbond, Tielt 2002, p. 21-22 De Boodt studied artes at the University of Louvain. He left to study canonical and civil law at the University of Orléans from the end of 1572. After completing his studies, he went to study for a while in Padua where his presence is confirmed in 1576. In 1579 he was appointed to the city council of Bruges and was involved in the financial administration of the city of Bruges.Boodt, Anselmus Boetius de at the Galileo Project However, he had to leave the city after the Calvinists took power. At the imperial court =Court physician= IJzerverken, drawing by Anselmus de Boodt De Boodt went to Bohemia where in 1583 he was appointed the personal physician of Wilhelm Rosenberg, an important diplomat and military leader of Bohemia, who lived in the Renaissance Castle of Český Krumlov in southern Bohemia. During his stay at the court of Rosenberg, he likely studied medicine at Heidelberg where he met the Swiss doctor of medicine Thomas Erastus. In 1584 he was appointed canon of St. Donat's Church in Bruges. He held the position until 1595 without leaving Prague. In 1586 de Boodt returned to Padua to continue his medicine study and obtained a doctorate the next year. In 1587 the Flemish doctor and pioneering botanist Carolus Clusius left the imperial botanical garden of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague, de Boodt took over his position. De Boodt was also appointed the medical court doctor of the Emperor. =Various works= De Boodt prepared a Theatrum Instrumentarum Mechanicorum for Emperor Rudolph II (unpublished), which described a wide range of scientific instruments. When the court engraver Martino Rota died in 1583 de Boodt obtained an engraving licence in 1588 to complete the third part of Rota's Last Judgement (Albertina, Vienna). When the Flemish court historian Jacobus Typotius died after completing the second part of his Symbola Divina et Humana, a collection of emblems and imprese (the first volume had appeared in Prague with engravings by Aegidius Sadeler), de Boodt completed the third and most voluminous part. The book appeared in 1603 and was reprinted at least 10 times up to 1972 (Academia, Graz). =Natural history studies= De Boodt also made many watercolours of native and exotic animals and plants. He filled twelve volumes with 728 illustrations of quadrupeds, reptiles, birds, fish, insects and plants. He thus aimed to depict all creatures of the natural world as his compatriot Joris Hoefnagel who was also working at Rudolph II's court had done earlier in his series of the Four Elements. De Boodt's volumes can be regarded as a paper museum. He developed a taxonomy and standardisation, which he added in many languages to his drawings. These drawings predate the Academy of the Lynxes around Galileo Galilei for which usually primacy of such material is claimed. De Boodt made most of the drawings himself but also engaged the services of other artists such as his compatriot Elias Verhulst from Mechelen.Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, Arcimboldo: Visual Jokes, Natural History, and Still-Life Painting, University of Chicago Press, 2009, p. 120-122 This Historia Naturalis remained in the hand of his heirs until 1844 and was partially published in 1989 (De Albums van Anselmus De Boodt, door M.C. Maselis, A. Balis, R. Marynissen; Lannoo Tielt; The Boodt Watercolours, 1999). =Geological studies= Instrument for cutting stones, p. 56 of the Gemmarum et Lapidum Historia The principal assignment of de Boodt was the study and cataloguing of all known rocks and minerals. He summarized his work in the Gemmarum et Lapidum Historia (The History of Gems and Stones), the first volume of which appeared in 1609 and was dedicated to the emperor. The original text was published in Latin in 1609 in Hanoviae (Hanau, now Germany). Two further editions in Latin were published in Leiden, the Dutch Republic, in 1636 and in 1647. These were organized by a physician of Leiden, Adriaan Toll, a commentator of the works of Galenus. The book was reprinted many times and translated into French. The book was used for many centuries for its information on the splitting of diamonds, how to recognize fake gems, colour- fast mixes for painters, exploration sites for geologists, the hardness of rocks and the health benefits of certain minerals. The first part of the book gives an account of the various causes of minerals. De Boodt's views on this were influenced by earlier scholastic authors and the Greek philosopher Aristotle. He was still able to arrive at a unique account for the causes of the formation of minerals and several of his ideas became well accepted throughout the seventeenth century.Anselmus de Boodt’s Gemmarum et Lapidum Historia The book contains important contributions to the theory of colour. The publication of the Gemmarum et Lapidum Historia ensured de Boodt's European reputation and he could afford to live in luxury. He still decided to leave the imperial court after the death of Rudolf II in 1612. Return to Bruges He returned to Bruges in 1614. Here he remained active as a physician, painted and performed on string instruments songs from his own Luteboec (Book of the Lute). He composed various literary works in his native Dutch as a member of the local Chamber of Rhetoric. He translated the Consolatione Philosophiae of Boethius into Dutch verse and for the youth he published spiritual liedekens (songs) such as De Baene des Deugds (The Way of Virtue) (1624) and De Baene des Hemels ende der Deughden (The Way of Heaven and the Virtues) (1628).

The Castle is known for its collection of massive horseshoes and is also recognised as one of the best examples of domestic Norman architecture in England. Admission to the castle is free. Owned and managed by the Rutland County Council, Oakham Castle is licensed for civil ceremonies. It is a Grade I listed building. History Castle Lane leading from the Market Place to Oakham Castle The Castle was built between 1180 and 1190 by Walkelin de Ferrers, lord of the manor of Oakham, son of Henry de Ferrers, a nephew of Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby (1062–1139). The Great Hall comprises a nave and two arcaded aisles, each with three large stone columns. There are a number of 12th century sculptures decorating the Hall including six musicians that are supported by the columns. The sculptures are carved from local stone quarried at Clipsham and are believed to have been made by masons who had also worked at Canterbury Cathedral. Oakham Castle is one of the longest-running seats of justice in England; a crown court has been held in the castle every two years since 1229. The present gateway into the market place closely resembles the gateways at Burley-on-the-Hill, and is thought to have been erected by the 1st Duke of Buckingham in the early 17th century. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it became the meeting place for Rutland County Council and remained as such until the County Council moved to Catmose House in 1936. Time Team, the Channel 4 archaeology series, filmed at Oakham Castle 26-28 June 2012; the programme was shown on 10 February 2013. The Castle was temporarily closed for an extensive restoration of the Castle, including the curtain wall. Oakham Castle was awarded a £2.165 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014 following a joint bid by Rutland County Council, Oakham Town Council and the Friends of Rutland County Museum.\\"Oakham Castle Closed For Restoration Work\\" Rutland County Council 1 September 2015 The castle reopened on 30 May 2016.\\"Oakham Castle in Rutland reopens after £2m restoration\\" BBC News 30 May 2016  Description  Due to its small size, Oakham Castle does not represent the traditional image of a castle. However, what is now called Oakham Castle was originally the Great Hall of a much larger fortified manor house. This had many of the traditional features of a castle such as a curtain wall, a gatehouse and a drawbridge with iron chains. There is also historical and archaeological evidence to suggest that Oakham Castle possessed towers at strategic points along the walls as well as a moat. An illustration in Mediaeval England edited by H. W. C. Davis suggests that the doorway shown to be in the centre of the wall was originally where the window at the end on the right now is. Also, there are no dormer windows in the illustration.Mediaeval England. A new edition of Barnard's Companion to English History. HWC Davis Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1924. p.55  The Horseshoes  Horseshoes on the east wall There remains a unique tradition that peers of the realm should forfeit a horseshoe to the Lord of the Manor of Oakham on their first visit to the town. Two hundred and thirty horseshoes currently decorate the walls of Oakham Castle. It is thought that this tradition is linked to the de Ferrers' family name; Ferrier was the Norman French word for farrier and the horseshoe has been a symbol of the de Ferrers family since Henry de Ferrers arrived in England in 1066. A horseshoe, orientated in accordance with county custom as the horseshoes are hung in the Castle, is used as a symbol of the county of Rutland and appears on the arms of the county council and on the flag of Rutland. The oldest surviving horseshoe in the collection is one that was presented by Edward IV in 1470 after his victory at the Battle of Losecoat Field. Recent additions to the collection are horseshoes presented by the Princess Royal in 1999, the Prince of Wales in 2003, Princess Alexandra in 2005 and the Duchess of Cornwall in 2014.

Under Mark Stitt, the department currently has four research groups: * System Regulation (Mark Stitt) * Intercellular Macromolecular Transport (Fritz Kragler) * Regulatory Networks (Marek Mutwil) * Plant Proteomics (Alexander Graf) =Organelle Biology, Biotechnology and Molecular Ecophysiology= The Organelle Biology, Biotechnology and Molecular Ecophysiology Department focuses on plant cell organelles (plastids and mitochondria), their physiology and gene expression as well as their metabolic and genetic interactions with the nucleo-cytosolic compartment. Transgenic technologies for nuclear and organellar genomes are developed and combined with biochemical and physiological methods to elucidate the genetic mechanisms regulating metabolic pathways, the assembly process of membrane protein complexes and structure-function relationships within multiprotein complexes in energy-transducing membranes. Applied research in the department addresses resistance management, metabolic engineering and the production of pharmaceuticals in plants. Other research topics concern the mechanisms of genome evolution in eukaryotes and the genetic and evolutionary processes that underlie the physiological plasticity of plant species, populations and ecosystems. Under Ralph Bock, the department currently has four research groups: * Organelle Biology and Biotechnology (Ralph Bock) * Algal Biomineralization (André Scheffel) * Cytoplasmic and Evolutionary Genetics (Stephan Greiner) * Photosynthesis Research (Mark Aurel Schöttler) See also * List of Max Planck Institutes and Research Groups References  External links  * Homepage * Homepage Category:1994 establishments in Germany Category:Biological research institutes Category:Education in Potsdam Category:Educational institutions established in 1994 Molecular Plant Physiology Category:Molecular biology institutes ","title":"Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology"},{"id":"10747140","text":"Guttersnipes were a four-piece punk, pop band, which formed in 1990 by Paul \\"Brocky\\" Brockhoff on guitar and vocals, Ian MacKaye on drums, Michael \\"Macca\\" McManus on bass guitar and Andrew \\"Ricey\\" Rice on guitar and vocals. Soon after MacKaye was replaced by Mark \\"Hursty\\" Hurst on drums. They issued an eight-track album, Blurred, in November 1991 (expanded with three bonus tracks in July of the following year) via Au-Go-Go Records. The group disbanded in 2001, although they occasionally reformed for additional shows.  History  Guttersnipes were formed as a four-piece punk, pop band, in Melbourne in 1990 by Paul \\"Brocky\\" Brockhoff on guitar and vocals, Ian MacKaye on drums, Michael \\"Macca\\" McManus on bass guitar and Andrew \\"Ricey\\" Rice on guitar and vocals. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, \\"Taking their cue from the likes of Hüsker Dü, Lemonheads, Fugazi and other 1980s US guitar bands, [they] traded in guitar-heavy pop. 'Melodic grunge' was a term often used to describe the band's loud, distorted yet tuneful approach.\\" MacKaye was replaced on drums by Michael \\"Macca\\" McManus. The band were signed to Au Go Go Records and released their debut single, \\"It's Over\\", in early 1991. The group's debut album, Blurred, followed in November of that year, initially as an eight-track, 10\\" long play. It was recorded with Simon Grounds as producer, audio engineer and mixer, from August to November. A CD version followed in July of the next year, with three bonus tracks from the \\"It's Over\\" single. During 1992 they supported gigs by visiting international groups, Lemonheads, Fugazi and Nirvana. During the 1990s they toured the eastern states, often together with fellow local label mates, Spiderbait, the Meanies and/or the Throwaways. In the early 1990s they formed a triad of bands with the Throwaways and Spiderbait, to organise shows under the umbrella, Tell 'em It's Healthy. This combined their audiences so that venues would see them as a worthwhile attraction. The Tell 'em It's Healthy shows frequently outsold those of the more established headline acts of the time. The Guttersnipes supported other international bands touring Australia, including Sonic Youth, Ween, Buffalo Tom, L7 and Bob Mould. They played with other Australian acts, including Cosmic Psychos, the Beasts of Bourbon, the Hard-Ons, the Splatterheads, Magic Dirt, Regurgitator, Screamfeeder, You Am I, Something for Kate and Kim Salmon and the Surrealists. They performed at festivals, including Meredith in 1991 and 1992. The Guttersnipes are no longer a professional working band since 2001. They played the occasional show in Melbourne but these were rare.  Members  * Paul Brockhoff – guitar, vocals * Ian MacKaye – drums * Michael McManus – bass guitar * Andrew Rice – guitar, vocals * Mark Hurst – drums  Radio broadcasts  Guttersnipes were the subject of two broadcasts on Triple J, Australia's national youth radio network. The first was a half an hour acoustic performance, which aired on 30 June 1992 as part of the Triple J Acoustic Sessions. The second broadcast was a forty-minute live performance, aired on 25 February 1993 as part of the Live at the Wireless program.

After a fire burns all the vegetation, they set out to find a new place to live. One day they trap a strange animal, looking very similar to them, only softer and with longer hair. She, Filli (Senta Berger), is attracted to one of the brothers, Ulli (Giuliano Gemma), and convinces him that a certain kind of playing with each other is far more satisfying than just eating her.

The village is known for its proximity to Erg Chebbi, and it is for this reason a part of the itineraries of many tourists visiting Morocco. It has been described as \\"a desert theme park\\", and the Erg Chebbi as \\"a wonderland of sand\\". Merzouga has the largest natural underground body of water in Morocco. A typical street in the older part of Merzouga In 2006, Merzouga experienced devastating flash floods, displacing 1,200 and resulting in some deaths. Near the dunes of Erg Chebbi there are some other known villages: Hassilabied away, Tanamoust away, Takoujt away, Khamlia away and Tisserdmine away. History Tradition asserts that Merzouga once flourished as a tropical jungle until it was turned into a desert environment when God punished families who refused offerings to a poor woman and buried them in the sand dunes of Erg Chebbi. In the past, like a number of regions and cities, Merzouga was uninhabited and later became a transit point for merchants heading for Timbuktu. It later became a pilgrimage to the nomads of the Ait Atta tribes and those who settled and worked to invest their money until it became a tourist destination to the current day. Many ancient fortified villages have existed in Merzouga for centuries. During French colonial rule, it was built by troops of the French Foreign Legion after the battles of Tafialet, which occurred between 1916 and 1932.

Background Users perform significant additional work outside of the formal processes of a line of business (LOB) system as they collaborate with other people via phone and email, obtain information from multiple sources in the form of documents and spreadsheets, and switch between online and offline modes for meetings and business trips. Applications and documents can be extended to add enterprise- specific features, and LOB systems can be integrated with Microsoft Office to make the LOB system more accessible. OBA's employ a composite application architecture, and link the 2007 Microsoft Office System applications running on the desktop to custom and off-the-shelf Line of Business (LOB) applications running on remote servers. Typically this link happens via web services. For example, rather than using Outlook only for email and calendaring, an OBA might allow Outlook to also provide a view into an inventory system, a customer service system, or an HR system. An OBA can mean easier-to-use applications and faster adoption of enterprise systems, because end users get the familiar Office-based experience, while connecting to sometimes-unfriendly information systems or applications in the enterprise. Often the LOB services can be orchestrated by a technology such as Microsoft Biztalk Server Julius. Development OBAs can be developed to meet a multitude of customer needs. For example, a company may want to: * Extend its LOB application to more users. * Implement an application that consolidates multiple user interfaces into a 2007 Office system document or SharePoint Server Web page. * Build a workflow application that helps users to regain control of critical documents. Companies can buy OBA's from their application vendors, or they can build their own OBAs. ISVs and integrators can build applications consistent to the OBA paradigm, and leverage the existing IT investments of their customers with the goal of delivering more end user productivity. Microsoft developed an OBA application, in cooperation with SAP, that is called Duet.

She had her biggest success with \\"Falling Into You\\" which was covered by Celine Dion, who also named her album after the single. Dion's album has sold well in excess of 30 million albums worldwide. Biography Marie-Claire D'Ubaldo released her debut album, Marie-Claire in Japan (only) in 1990. Her follow-up Spanish language album, Alma de Barro, was released in 1994, and the English Language version, Marie-Claire D'Ubaldo, was released internationally in the same year. Her biggest personal hit was The Rhythm Is Magic; it went to number 1 in Italy for 5 weeks in the summer was the 4th most air played single of the year and was used in the soundtrack to the Italian film Il Ciclone. The song and album did very well in Italy, Japan, Latin America, Hispanic North America, Austria, Finland, Norway, and Russia. Other songs featured on the album were written with Rick Nowels (Belinda Carlisle/Stevie Nicks), Billy Steinberg (Eternal Flame/True Colours/Like a Virgin etc.), and Tony Moore (ex-Cutting Crew) Marie Claire was signed by creative executive, Dave Massey, to a songwriting agreement at leading independent music publisher, Hit & Run Music Publishing in 1993 (see Billboard photo). D'Ubaldo was a rare instance of a UK based publisher signing a latin-influenced artist / songwriter. Massey's meeting with Annie Rosebery (then at Elektra in London), who was interested in signing Marie Claire, led to the collaboration with Nowels and Steinberg. At the beginning of 1995, Polydor had closed its US office and Davitt Sigerson, who had signed Marie Claire to the label, had left. According to Tony Moore (ex- Cutting Crew and songwriter / musician and friend of Marie Claire's), 'nobody at Polygram was serious about supporting the album or recording a new one and didn't see \\"Falling Into You\\" as a hit, they dropped her'. Marie-Claire is best known for the single \\"Falling Into You\\" which was written and originally performed by Marie Claire, but later covered by Celine Dion; the single was to become the title track for Celine's album. The original backing track recorded by Marie-Claire, along with her own backing vocals, is the version used by Celine. This version was used in the film 'Terminal Velocity'. During the late 1990s and early millennium, Marie-Claire often performed live in London at The Kashmir Klub and The Bedford, performing the tracks she had written for herself and other artists.

That foundation was dissolved in 1177 by Henry II, who founded in its place a house of the Order of Fontevraud, known as Amesbury Priory. The name Amesbury Abbey is now used by a nearby Grade I listed country house, built in the 1830s, which is currently in use as a nursing home. History thumb Amesbury was already a sacred place in pagan times, and there are legends that a monastery existed there before the Danish invasions. There may have been an existing cult of St Melor which led Ælfthryth to choose Amesbury. Melor,Cf. François Plaine, Vita inedita sancti Melori martyris, in Analecta Bollandiana 5 (1886) 166-176; Acta Sanctorum, Octobris XI, p. 943; Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina antiquae et mediae aetatis, Brussels, 1901, vol. 2, p. 862 the son of a leader of Cornouaille and a boy-martyr, was buried at Lanmeur and venerated in Brittany, but a later tradition claims that some of his relics were brought to Amesbury and sold to the abbess. Edward was another boy-martyr. However, the 12th-century life of St Melor says the nunnery at Amesbury was founded before Melor's relics arrived.“Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey, later priory, of Amesbury”, in Ralph Pugh, Elizabeth Crittall, eds., Wiltshire Victoria County History, Vol. 3 (University of London, 1956) pp. 242–259 The cult of St Melor is commemorated in the dedication of the current Amesbury parish church. =Saxon Abbey= The monastery was founded by Queen Ælfthryth in about the year 979 on what may have been the site of an earlier monastery. She founded two religious houses at about the same time, the other being at Wherwell in Hampshire. Ælfthryth's motive was long believed to be contrition for the murder of Edward the Martyr, making the date of 979 given by the Melrose chronicle appropriate. However, she is now considered not to have been personally responsible for the murder. At the time of the Domesday Book (1086), the abbey held, as it had had in King Edward's time, the Wiltshire manors of Bulford, Boscombe, Allington, SalisburyAllington , Choulston, and Maddington, totalling twenty-seven hides, together with the manor of Rabson in Winterbourne Bassett. In Berkshire it held Ceveslane in Challow, Fawley, and Kintbury and the church at Letcombe Regis. It seems that for most of its existence Amesbury Abbey was probably not of particular importance and its overall income was not especially high. It was, like all women's houses in particular, liable to harassment, rustling and other incursions by powerful neighbours, as well as abusive tax exactions. At the £54, 15 shillings that it reached, it was admittedly just above Wherwell Abbey (Hampshire) and Chatteris Abbey (Cambridgeshire), but it was less than other nunneries in its region, such as Wilton Abbey (Wiltshire), Shaftesbury Abbey (Dorset) or Romsey Abbey (Hampshire).David Knowles, The Monastic Order in England: A History of its Development from the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council, 940-1216, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1963. pp. 702-703. As to the Abbesses of Amesbury, the references are extremely sparse. For the period before the Conquest there is only a retrospective mention much later of Heahpled (?), in the years 979 and 1013, and at the time of the houses refoundation, of the then incumbent Abbess, Beatrice (1177). =New foundation= In 1177 Ælfthryth's foundation was dissolved by Henry II and reconstituted as a house of the Order of Fontevraud, a Benedictine reform. Pope Alexander III issued a bull on 15 September 1176 approving the plan but specifying that the Archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of London, Exeter and Worcester were to visit the convent and notify the nuns of the need to cooperate. Any nun who declined to join the new Order was to be transferred to another monastery and treated well. The new regime was then to be introduced and when the commission of bishops decided the moment had come, the abbess and a party of nuns from Fontevraud Abbey were to come to complete the handover. Things did not go quite as smoothly as this formula suggested, though the accounts may display a natural bias against the existing community. In the event, it was said that scandal was discovered when the bishops of Exeter and Worcester made their inspection in the octave of the feast of St Hilary, 1177. The abbess was deposed and dismissed with a pension.Eileen E. Power, Medieval English Nunneries c 1275 to 1535, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1922, p. 455. Some of the other nuns were compromised and unrepentant and these were also expelled. Those willing to make amends received the offer to stay on; it seems that there were some 30 nuns and they were all expelled. The party that Henry II then summoned from Fontevraud were in the end some 21 or 24 nuns, led not by the Abbess of Fontevraud but by a former subprioress. Some nuns were also brought from Westwood Priory, also a Fontevraud house. The new community was solemnly installed on 22 May in the King's presence by the Archbishop of Canterbury, accompanied by several other bishops. =Order of Fontevrault= Robert of Arbrissel in now lost effigy from Fontevraud Abbey. It is known that the Plantagenets were great benefactors of the mother abbey at Fontevraud in its early years and Henry's widow, Eleanor of Aquitaine, took up residence there. That monastery, founded in 1101,Cf. Jean Dalarun, Robert d Arbrissel, fondateur de Fontevraud, Albin Michel, Paris 1986; Gabrielle Esperdy, The Royal Abbey of Fontevrault: Religious Women and the Shaping of Gendered Space, in Journal of International Women's Studies 6: 2 (2006) 59–80. http://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol6/iss2/5 [accessed 29 September 2017]; Fiona J. Griffiths, The Cross and the Cura monialium: Robert of Arbrissel, John the Evangelist, and the Pastoral Care of Women in the Age of Reform, in Speculum 83 (2008) 303–330. became the chosen mausoleum of the Angevin dynasty and the centre of a new monastic Order, the Order of Fontevrault. The Fontevraud monastic reform followed in part the lead of the highly influential and prestigious Cluny Abbey in adopting a centralized form of government, whereby in a federated structure the superiors of subsidiary houses were in effect deputies of the Abbot of Cluny, the head of the Order, and their houses were hence usually styled priories, not abbeys, governed therefore not by abbots but by priors.Michael Ott, Priory, in The Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 12, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911; George Cyprian Alston, Congregation of Cluny, in The Catholic Encyclopedia. vol. 4, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. [Accessed 29 September 2017] In the analogous case of the Order of Fontevraud, its head was the Abbess of Fontevraud, who at the death of the Order's founder, Robert of Arbrissel, in about 1117, already had under her rule 35 priories, and by the end of that century about 100, in France, Spain and England.Jean Favier, Les Plantagenêts: Origine et destin d'un empire, Fayard, Poitiers, 2004, p. 152 Fontevraud also took up a feature that had appeared sporadically in early centuries whereby its houses were double monasteries, with separately housed convents of both men and women, under a common superior, which in the case of the Order of Fontevraud was a prioress. The men had their own male superior, but he was subject to the prioress. At Amesbury and in some other locations this model seems to have broken down and by the beginning of the 15th century Amesbury seems to have become an exclusively women's house, with a small group of priest-chaplains external to the Order. =Amesbury Priory= King Henry II, founder of Amesbury Priory Though it was above all Henry II who over his long reign (1133–1189) introduced the Order of Fontevraud into England, there seem only ever to have been in the country four houses in all. Apart from Amesbury, these were Westwood Priory (Worcestershire),Houses of Benedictine nuns: Priory of Westwood, in J.W.

In advance, that is to say, of Henry II's revamping of the foundation at Amesbury (1177). Although the later Amesbury monastery is popularly referred to as an \\"Abbey\\", this is not strictly exact. Presumably the fading memory of historical fact after the Reformation, aided by the elimination of Catholicism, and later the inroads of Romanticism accounts for the usage. Doubtless also the search for an elegant name for the later nearby mansion counted for something. The first monastery appears to have truly been an abbey, but the Fontevraud daughter house was always technically a priory. =Some women of Amesbury Priory= Eleanor of Brittany (died 1241), a princess held captive for most of her life, donated her body and was buried here, and later King Henry III would grant to the abbey a manor of Melksham in suffrage for her soul and that of her brother Arthur, who was widely believed to have been murdered by King John. Eleanor of Provence, Queen consort of Henry III of England, died in Amesbury on 24 or 25 June 1291, and was buried in the abbey on 11 September 1291. From about at least 1343 to her death some time before February 1349, Isabel of Lancaster, was Prioress of Amesbury. Isabel was the sister of Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, a great-grandson of King Henry III. She was also younger sister of the formidable Maud of Lancaster, Countess of Ulster. In 1347, the twice- widowed Maud also entered a nunnery, in her case Campsey Priory, a house of Augustinian canonesses near Wickham Market in Suffolk, but in 1364 she transferred to the Poor Clares community at Bruisyard Abbey, where she died and was buried in 1377. Not half a century later, the prioress was Sybil Montague, a woman well-placed as a niece of William Montague, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, who died in 1389 and sister of John Montague, 3rd Earl of Salisbury.Douglas Richardson, Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, vol. 1, Everington, Salt Lake City, 2nd edition 2001, p. 157. Sybil's election as prioress in 1391 was confirmed by the King, Richard II.Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey, later priory, of Amesbury, in R.B. Pugh & Elizabeth Crittall (edd.), A History of the County of Wiltshire, vol. 3, London, 1956, pp. 242-259. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/wilts/vol3/pp242-259 [accessed 29 September 2017]. Dame Sybil seems in effect to have abolished the system of male priors, though this caused a great upheaval and involved the intervention of the new King, Henry IV, against the background of his seizure of power from Richard II. Dame Sybil seems to have navigated the rapids and remained prioress, dying only in 1420. =Dissolution= It seems likely that the Amesbury parish church, the Church of St Mary and St Melor, is the former priory church, and this may explain why it was spared at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, though the priory and its other buildings were destroyed. The church is a Grade I listed building. The Amesbury estate was subsequently obtained from the Crown by Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford,John Chandler & Peter Goodhugh, Amesbury: history and description of a south Wiltshire town (1989), p. 24 a nephew to Jane Seymour, Queen consort of Henry VIII, and the eldest son of her brother, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of England during the minority of King Edward VI, the Earl's cousin, with whom he had been educated in infancy.Albert Frederick Pollard, \\"Seymour, Edward (1539?–1621)\\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 51(1897). Present-day Amesbury Abbey The nearby country house, also called Amesbury Abbey, stands in 35 acres of parkland and was not part of the nunnery. It was built in 1834–1840 by architect Thomas Hopper for Sir Edmund Antrobus. It was constructed in a cubic form of Chilmark limestone ashlar with slate roofs with three storeys and attics, and replaced a previous house built in 1660–1661 by John Webb for the second Duke of Somerset. The main south front has nine bays, of which five sit behind a portico of six composite columns. The main entrance was originally on a piano nobile behind the colonnade. The house is now used as a nursing home. The name Amesbury Abbey is also used by the company which runs it and several other similar facilities.

The battles, which occurred on 25 May, 29 May, 13 August, and 1 November 1809, were part of the Tyrolean Rebellion and the War of the Fifth Coalition. The Tyrolean forces, loyal to Austria, were led by Andreas Hofer, Josef Speckbacher, Peter Mayr, Capuchin Father Joachim Haspinger, and Major Martin Teimer. The Bavarians were led by French Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre, and Bavarian Generals Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy and Karl Philipp von Wrede. After being driven from Innsbruck at the start of the revolt, the Bavarians twice reoccupied the city and were chased out again. After the final battle in November, the rebellion was suppressed.  Background  After his humiliating defeat of the Austrian Empire in the War of the Third Coalition, Napoleon transferred the County of Tyrol to Bavaria. When the new rulers imposed conscription and Bavarian legal codes on the territory, they flouted ancient Tyrolean social and religious rights.Arnold Napoleon, p 20 Before the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition, Austrian agents circulated the Tyrol to take advantage of the existing tensions. When Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen invaded Bavaria on 10 April 1809, the Tyrol exploded in revolt.Arnold Crisis, p 67  Battles  The Tyrol 1809 Order of Battle lists the regular units and organizations of both armies. = First Battle of Bergisel (12 April 1809) = Bergisel today with ski jump On 11 April Hofer and 5,000 armed peasants scored a victory at Sterzing in the South Tyrol when they captured 420 Bavarians of the 4th Light Infantry Battalion.Smith, p 285 Under Teimer and other leaders, the Tyroleans irregulars won a brilliant initial success. Attacked incessantly for 48 hours, Lieutenant General Baron Kinkel surrendered his Innsbruck garrison of 3,860 Bavarian soldiers on 13 April.Arnold Napoleon, p 103 A body of 2,050 French conscripts under hard- drinking General of Division Baptiste Pierre Bisson unwittingly marched into the trap. After an ineffectual defense, the French also put up the white flag.Arnold Napoleon, p 21 The rebels seized five cannon, two mortars, considerable equipment, and many muskets. The captured material would keep the rebellion supplied with weapons for months. = May 1809 = Soon reinforced by a regular Austrian division under Feldmarschallleutnant Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles, the Tyrolese posed a threat to the rear areas of Napoleon's armies in northern Italy and Bavaria. One column of irregulars stiffened by a few regulars under General-Major Franz Fenner raided the area of Lake Garda in Italy. In consequence, Viceroy of Italy Eugène de Beauharnais was forced to provide substantial Franco-Italian garrisons to guard the area. In early May, Napoleon directed Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre and the VII Corps (made up of Bavarians) to move against the Tyrol.Petre, pp 249–250 The Bavarian garrison of Kufstein Fortress was relieved on 11 May. Lefebvre routed Chasteler at the Battle of Wörgl on 13 May.Petre, p 263 After several more actions, Lefebvre occupied Innsbruck around 19 May.Petre, p 272 = Second Battle of Bergisel (29 May 1809) = On 25 May 1809, Lieutenant General Deroy's 3rd Bavarian Division clashed with the Tyrolese rebels at the Bergisel. Deroy committed 4,000 troops and 12 artillery pieces to the combat. Hofer commanded the rebel army and his lieutenants were Speckbacher, Teimer, Josef Eisenstecken, and Oberstleutnant Ertel. Hofer's army included 9,400 armed rebels and 900 Austrian regulars. The regulars included one battalion each of the 16th Lusignan Infantry Regiment and 25th De Vaux Infantry Regiment, two companies of the 9th Jäger battalion, a half-squadron of the 3rd O'Reilly Chevau-léger Regiment and five guns. The Bavarians lost 20 to 70 dead and 100 to 150 wounded, while inflicting losses of 50 dead and 30 wounded on the Tyrolese. Though historian Digby Smith labels the action a Bavarian victory, his narrative says the battle was a draw. He notes that the rebels, discouraged that more local people had not joined the revolt, retreated to the south.Smith, pp 311–312 The rebels returned on 29 May and subjected Deroy to a second attack, which he resisted with 5,240 troops organized in 12 battalions, eight squadrons, and 18 guns. The 13,600 Tyrolese irregulars were joined by 1,200 Austrian regulars and six pieces of artillery. The rebels included 35 North Tyrol and 61 South Tyrol schützen and landsturm companies. The Bavarians managed to hold their ground after suffering 87 dead, 156 wounded, and 53 missing. The rebels lost 90 dead and 160 wounded.Smith, p 313 The next day, low on ammunition and food, Deroy evacuated Innsbruck and retreated to Kufstein Fortress in the north.German wikipedia, Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy = July and early August 1809 = After Napoleon's war-winning victory at the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July,Smith, p 322 Lefebvre invaded the Tyrol again and Deroy won a minor action at the Lueg Pass on 24 July. However, the Tyrol responded to Hofer's call for another uprising.Smith, p 326 About 5,000 Tyrolese led by Haspinger and Speckbacher smashed French General Marie François Rouyer's 3,600 Confederation of the Rhine troops at Franzensfeste on 4 and 5 August. The Ducal Saxon Infantry Regiment was annihilated with 988 casualties, while the Bavarians lost an additional 100 men and two cannons. Tyrolean losses were trifling. The valley is still known as the Sachsenklemme (Saxon Trap). The next day, Lefebvre arrived with the 1st Bavarian Division, but he was also repulsed by the Tyrolese.Smith, p 329 On 8 and 9 August at Prutz, 920 Tyrolese led by Roman Burger routed Oberst Burscheidt's 2,000 soldiers of the 10th Bavarian Infantry and 2nd Dragoon Regiments, which belonged to Deroy's 3rd Division. The Tyrolese inflicted 200 killed and wounded on their enemies while capturing 1,200 men and two cannons. Rebel losses were only seven killed.Smith, 330 = Third Battle of Bergisel (13 August 1809) = The Saxon Trap at Franzensfeste On 13 August, Hofer and 18,000 Tyrolese fought Deroy's division in the third battle of Bergisel. Four Bavarian battalions belonging to General Siebein's 2nd Brigade lost 200 dead and 250 wounded. The 70 companies of rebels lost 100 dead and 220 wounded. After taking hostages from leading local families, Lefebvre abandoned Innsbruck and the last occupation troops were gone from the Tyrol by 18 August.Smith, p 331 = September and October 1809 = Speckbacher and 2,000 irregulars attacked the Bavarian garrisons in the villages of Lofer, Luftenstein, Unken, and Mellek on 25 September. Of the 700 soldiers belonging to the Leib Infantry Regiment # 1, 50 were killed and wounded, 300 captured, and 100 missing. The troops were dispersed with only two companies in each village. The detachment in Mellek broke out and retreated north to Bad Reichenhall; the other garrisons were wiped out.Smith, pp 332–333 On the same day Haspinger with 2,400 Tyrolese and four guns evicted General-Major Stengel's brigade from the Lueg Pass near Golling an der Salzach. The 3,500 Bavarians and three cannons retreated north to Salzburg. Lefebvre, with 2,000 of Stengel's troops attacked Hallein on 3 October. Haspinger's force, which had lingered in the town, was chased back into the mountains, leaving their six cannons behind.Smith, p 333 Button showing Andreas Hofer At this time, Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon replaced Lefebvre in command of VII Corps and the third invasion of the Tyrol was launched. On 17 October, the 1st Bavarian Division led by General-Major Rechberg caught Speckbacher and his 2,000 men by surprise at Bodenbichl. The Tyrolese failed to properly picket their camp and the 3,000 Bavarians inflicted a serious defeat on the irregulars. Rebel losses were 300 dead and 400 captured, while the Bavarians admitted only seven casualties. For this action, Rechberg was awarded the Military Order of Max Joseph from his grateful sovereign. = Fourth Battle of Bergisel (1 November 1809) = The fourth battle of Bergisel took place on 1 November 1809. Lieutenant General Wrede's 2nd Bavarian Division defeated Hofer's and Haspinger's 70 companies of irregulars. The Bavarians committed 6,000 troops and 12 guns to the action and lost only one killed and 40 wounded. The 8,535 Tyrolese suffered 350 killed, wounded, and captured, and abandoned five cannons. The fourth battle and the disaster at Bodenbichl broke the back of the rebellion.Smith, p 336 Hofer was betrayed to the French on 28 January 1810 and was shot on 20 February 1810 at Mantua in Italy.

It was founded in 1177 to replace the earlier Amesbury Abbey, a Saxon foundation established about the year 979. The Anglo-Norman Amesbury Priory was disbanded at the Dissolution of the monasteries and ceased to exist as a monastic house in 1539.Cf. David M. Smith (ed.), The Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, III. 1377-1540, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008, p. 622. While the earlier Amesbury Abbey had been exclusively a nunnery or house of women, its successor, Amesbury Priory, following the particular structures of its parent Order of Fontevraud, was both a convent of nuns and a corresponding monastery of men, both governed locally by a prioress and ultimately by the Abbess of Fontevraud Abbey, situated in Anjou, part of the territories in what is now France that were then ruled by the English royal house.

This is Grade I listed building which has been converted into a nursing home. The name is also used by the company which runs it along with several other similar facilities. New foundation Henry II’s plan to replace the existing Amesbury Abbey, with a priory of the Fontevraud reform was confirmed by a bull of Pope Alexander III dated 15 September 1176, which ordered that the Archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of London, Exeter and Worcester formally notify in person the nuns of the intended change and offer them the possibility of remaining in the new institution. In the event, as was remarked, none did.Adrian Morey, Bartholomew of Exeter, Bishop and Canonist: A Study in the Twelfth Century, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1937. The initiative to refound at Amesbury was presented officially as part of a general movement to reform monasteries in England and an inspection was carried out at the existing Abbey which claimed to have uncovered a situation of laxity and immoral conduct. The abbess was reported to have had three children.Eileen E. Power, Medieval English Nunneries c 1275 to 1535, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1922, p. 455. Though it was said that some of the existing nuns were willing to mend their ways and so received the offer to remain, in actual fact the entire community of some 30 nuns vacated the house, including the last incumbent Abbess, Beatrice, who was dismissed with a pension.The pension was still being paid in 1182, cf.

The takeover of Amesbury Abbey was, Gerald alleges, an inexpensive way of founding at least one. However, contrary to this accusation, the records show that in fact Henry spend a lot of money on his foundation,Cf. Amanda M.

Once the abbey had been liquidated, Henry II then had a new founding group come from Fontevraud, amounting to 21 or 24 nuns, led by a former subprioress. In addition some nuns were also brought from Westwood Priory, likewise a Fontevraud house.For the interest of Henry in other Fontevraud houses, cf. Sharon Elkins, Holy Women of Twelfth-Century England, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 1989, pp. 146-148.

Order of Fontevraud Robert of Arbrissel in the now lost effigy This act of favour of Henry II towards the Order of Fontevraud was not an isolated one in the course of his long reign (1133-1189).

Henry's actions at Amesbury, therefore, brought the total of Fontevraud houses in England to four, after which no others were ever established. It is known that the Plantagenets were great benefactors of the mother abbey at Fontevraud in its early years and Henry's widow, Eleanor of Aquitaine, took up residence there. More generally, that monastery, founded in 1101,Cf.

The Fontevraud monastic reform had two notable distinguishing features. Firstly, it followed in part the model established by the highly influential and prestigious Cluny Abbey, which by the 12th century numbered more than a thousand monasteries.Mortimer Chambers, The Western Experience, Knopf, pp. 269–283) in adopting a centralized form of government. While most Benedictine monasteries remained autonomous and associated with each other only loosely, Cluny created a federated order in which the superiors of subsidiary houses were deputies of the Abbot of Cluny, the Order's head. These subsidiary houses were hence usually styled priories, not abbeys, governed therefore not by abbots but by priors, or more technically obedientiary priors.Michael Ott, Priory, in The Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 12, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911; George Cyprian Alston, Congregation of Cluny, in The Catholic Encyclopedia. vol. 4, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. [Accessed 29 September 2017] The head of the Order of Fontevraud was the Abbess of Fontevraud. At the death in about 1117 of the founder, Robert of Arbrissel, she already had under her rule 35 priories, and by the end of that century about 100, in France, Spain and England.Jean Favier, Les Plantagenêts: Origine et destin d'un empire, Fayard, Poitiers, 2004, p. 152. The second characteristic feature of Fontevraud was that its houses were double monasteries, with separately housed convents of both men and women, under a common superior, a prioress. The men had their own male superior, but he was subject to the prioress. Local circumstances seem, however, to have modified this formula in some locations. For example, Grovebury Priory, a Fontevraud monastery in Bedfordshire, was a small house of men that never had any nuns.Alien house: Priory of La Grave or Grovebury, in A History of the County of Bedford, vol. 1, London, 1904, pp. 403-404. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/beds/vol1/pp403-404 [accessed 29 September 2017]. In many locations there was in effect a house of women to which was attached a small house of chaplains that had little to distinguish it from many others that had no links with Fontevraud, such as the Augustinian canonesses house Campsey Priory in Suffolk. At Amesbury Priory the ordained men are referred to in the historical records as \\"canons\\" or \\"chaplains\\" not \\"monks\\". They should in theory have been monks. This calls to mind the usages of an English reform movement, the Gilbertine Order, which also had double monasteries. In each of the latter, the key component was a nunnery run on almost Cistercian lines, and hence ultimately following the Rule of St Benedict, while the annexed male house were canons regular, living according to a variant of the Rule of St Augustine.Houses of the Gilbertine order: The priory of Sempringham, in William Page (ed.), A History of the County of Lincoln, vol. 2, London, 1906, pp. 179-187. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/lincs/vol2/pp179-187 [accessed 2 October 2017]. It would appear that at Fontevraud there was a degree of evolution of Rule and structures, even in the choice of Rule of the men,Nicole Bouter (ed.) Les Religieuses dans le cloître et dans le monde des origines à nos jours, Centre européen de recherches sur les congrégations et ordres religieux, Université Jean Monet, Saint-Étienne, 1994, pp. 336ff.; Jean-Marc Bienvenu, Les premiers temps de Fontevraud (1101-1189). Naissance et évolution d'un Ordre, thèse, Université de Paris IV (Sorbonne), 1981. which later became that of St Benedict. With the passing of the Plantagenet dynasty, Fontevraud and her dependencies began to fall upon hard times, and it was said that a moment came at Fontevraud when they had only the blackest of bread to eat on Fridays.Alien house: Priory of La Grave or Grovebury, in A History of the County of Bedford, vol. 1, London, 1904, pp. 403–404. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/beds/vol1/pp403-404 [accessed 29 September 2017]. On the Continent the decline was worsened by the devastation of the 14th century Hundred Years War. In 1460 a canonical visitation of some fifty of the Order's priories revealed that most were barely occupied, if not totally abandoned.Carlos M.N. Eire, Reformations: The Early Modern World, 1450-1650, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2016, p. 127. At Amesbury King Henry II, founder of Amesbury Priory Although the later Amesbury monastery is popularly referred to as an \\"Abbey\\", this is not strictly speaking exact. Presumably the mistaken usage is accounted for by the fading memory of historical facts after the Reformation, aided by the elimination of Catholicism, and later the inroads of Romanticism. Doubtless also the search for an elegant name for the later nearby mansion counted for something. The Saxon monastery appears to have truly been an abbey, but the Fontevraud daughter house was always technically a priory. Amesbury Priory's relations with the mother house were only sporadically recorded. In 1203, under King John, the Prioress of Amesbury was made the channel for paying to the Abbess of Fontevraud a rent out of the Exchequer for the support of a chaplain who would pray for the soul of John's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, who herself years before had given 20 marks to Amesbury for prayers for the soul of her late husband, John's father, Henry. In 1221 the then Abbess of Fontevraud, Berthe, affixed her seal to confirm a gift made by Amesbury. Not many years later, Berthe was succeeded by Adela of Brittany, a member of the ducal house, who ruled in the years 1228-1244. Adela was said to have been brought up at Amesbury.Histoire de l'Ordre de Fontevrault (1100-1908), Auch, 1913, t. II, pp. 104-105; Jean-François Bodin, Recherches historiques sur la ville d’Angers, 2nd edition, t. 2, Saumur, 1846, p. 630. A visit in January 1256 from John, the sacrist of Fontevraud, highlights some interesting details. Arrived at Amesbury, he summoned the prioress, prior, cellaress, chaplains, and lay brothers before him and inspected the prior's accounts. It emerged that income was £100 from rents and £40 from wool, while expenditure was £180, though the house was not in debt. It held 59 charters. There was a complement of a prioress and 76 nuns, a prior and 6 other chaplains, a clerk, and 16 lay brothers, some of whom lived at the priory's granges. Valuable items, largely confined to the chapels, were 4 chalices of silver gilt, 2 silver cups, 2 silver crosses, and 2 censers. In livestock, the priory possessed 4, 280 sheep, 200 oxen, 7 cows, 4 calves, 23 horses and 300 swine over a year old. Mention is made of a previous audit undertaken as recently as 21 September 1255. In 1256 the house was short of corn, which was perhaps a recurrent local problem since in 1189 Richard I had made a grant of £10 for corn. The Abbess of Fontevraud in 1265-1276, Joan de Dreux, faced various difficulties in the mother house. It seems that on the advice of Edward I she withdrew to Amesbury with her two nieces and another nun, and governed the Order from there.Histoire de l'Ordre de Fontevrault (1100-1908), Auch, 1913, t. II, pp. 119-122. At the end of the century, in 1293, the office of prioress of Amesbury fell vacant and to fill it the nuns held an election. Princess Mary (acting for the abbess), supported by the prior, contested the election, on the grounds that the right to provide belonged to Fontevraud. When the quarrel reached the King, he appointed the Bishops of Durham and Bishop of Lincoln to take up the spiritual government of the house, choosing a nun as their intermediary, until the matter was resolved. The solution came when the king asked the abbess to send one of her own nuns to Amesbury as prioress, and in 1294 the capable Joan de Jennes arrived. The king, who had already visited Amesbury in person in August 1293, issued a royal confirmation of the new prioress's election. He visited the priory again to see the new prioress in action in August 1294.Mary Anne Everett Green, Lives of the Princesses of England from the Norman Conquest, vol. 2, London, 1849, pp.416-417. A 1341 letter of the king, Edward III, to Amesbury Priory during the Hundred Years' War disputed some of the rights of the abbess and restricted others. In the light of this, when the prioress died about 1349 the nuns played safe and sought the king's licence to elect. This created a precedent for the future that was followed in 1379 and 1391.H.F. Chettle, The English Houses of the Order of Fontevraud, in Downside Review 60 (1942) 47-48. While it does not seem completely certain, it is likely that sometime after 1403 the priory became “denizen”, i.e. naturalised English, and so immune to the further measures against alien priories that came in 1414. However, apparently in contradiction to this is the fact that when in 1486 Dame Alice Fisher was elected prioress, she sent a priest said to be her chaplain to the Abbess of Fontevraud with gifts in token of submission. In reply received a cordial letter, dated 16 May 1486, which confirmed her in the office, recalled the nature of the Order and the importance of observing the statutes and of keeping the obits of Robert d'Arbrissel, Henry II, Richard I, and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Admittedly, this is the last recorded contact of Amesbury with the mother house and it is not sure that under the Tudors an effective connection was maintained. At Amesbury there is no explicit mention of men until the charter of 1189,Histoire de l'Ordre de Fontevrault (1100-1908), Auch, 1913, t. II, pp. 60-61; H.F. Chettle, The English Houses of Order of the Fontevraud, in Downside Review 60 (1942) 37. whereas there is talk of a chaplain in 1180 and a prior in 1194. To this can be added the mention in 1256 of a prior, 6 other chaplains and a clerk, along with 16 lay brothers, In the next century, there were 12 chaplains, including the prior in 1315-1316 and two fresh clerks were ordained in 1315-1316, which presumably explains the total of 14 chaplains and clerks in 1317-1318. In that year there were also 6 lay brothers. In 1381, however, there was a drop to 8 brethren, only one of whom a priest, and one lay brother. In general it looks as though there was in principle a fixed number of 12 chaplains in the 14th century, a figure confirmed in the investigations into the troubles of 1400, when the then prioress had apparently been attempting to reduce this to four chaplain-canons, replacing the others with secular priests.Douglas Richardson, Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, vol. 1, Everington, Salt Lake City, 2nd edition 2001, p. 157; Gwen Seabourne, Imprisoning Medieval Women: The Non- Judicial Confinement and Abduction of Women in England, c. 1170-1509, Ashgate, Farnham, 2013, pp. 138-139; Malcolm Vale, Henry V: The Conscience of a King, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2016, p. 193. In the mid-14th century the Prior of Amesbury seems to emerge for a time as a more prominent figure. In 1355 the then prior paid a visit to the mother house and for the two years following was the abbesses's proctor in England. After the 1360 Treaty of Brétigny between England and France, the restrictions on the abbess's control of the English Fontevraud estates were lifted. At that point the Queen, Philippa of Hainault, wrote personally to Fontevraud asking the abbess to instruct the Prioress of Amesbury to appoint William of Amesbury as prior, singing her candidate's praises. The commissioner sent by the abbess to ensure this arrived in the summer of 1361 and duly installed William as prior and had him swear allegiance to the abbess. In 1365 the Prior of Amesbury conducted an inquiry on behalf of the abbess into alleged crimes committed at Amesbury's sister house Nuneaton Priory. Like the mother Abbey of Fontevraud, Amesbury, for all its royal connections and its institutional endowments, appears to have known real poverty at times, as did its sister houses at Westwood and Nuneaton. As to poverty, only at Grovebury among the Fontevraud English dependencies is there no mention of it. This house was (unlike the others) regarded as an alien priory (i.e., a particular category of English dependency of a French mother-house) and would have suffered various types of more severe harassment whenever there were hostilities between France and England. Like others of similar status, it was to be suppressed in 1414. Life of the Priory While even in the absence of recorded specifics, we must suppose that the daily life at Amesbury Priory went on as in any monastery of its type, the relations with the royal house remained a constant at least till the end of the fifteenth century. It was undoubtedly the leading Fontevraud house in England and in this period it reflected the tendency already established at the mother house for its heads to be women of high rank.Brian Golding, Authority and Discipline at the Paraclete, Fontevraud and Sempringham, in Gert Melville & Anne Müller (edd.), Mittelalterliche Orden und Klöster im Vergleich: methodische Ansätze und Perspektiven, Lit Verlag, Berlin, 2007, pp. 87-111, at p. 104. In the reigns of Richard I (1189-1199) and John (1199-1216) there was a gradual increase in the estates of Amesbury Priory, including the acquisition in 1197 of 78 acres nearby in Barford St Martin. In 1202 King John effectively cleared the prioress's debts.H.E. Salter (ed.), The Cartulary of Oseney Abbey, vol. 1, Oxford Historical Society, Oxford, 1929 (= Oxford Historical Society 89), pp. 246-247. He also gave her £18 in 1207. Henry II had made some grants in kind doubtlessly gratefully received, such as the provision which allowed of firewood the nuns to take five cartloads of wood daily from Chute, Grovely, Winterslow, Bentley and Wallop woods. These rights regarding Bentley and Grovely were certainly still being exercised in 1255, and in 1271-1272 in Winterslow and Bentley, though in the latter only 6 cartloads of wood a week were being drawn at that period. Henry III maintained the Plantagenet interest in the Order of Fontevraud. He visited Amesbury in 1223, 1231, 1241, and 1256 and in 1270 he inspected and renewed Henry II's charter. He also granted various items of income and privileges. Hence, in 1231 firewood was granted out of Buckholt, Chute and Grovely woods and 6 quarters of nuts out of Clarendon Wood. The next year more firewood for the priory kiln was granted from Grovely next year and in 1256 from Chute. The crown intervened also with materials to assist in the enlarging of the monastery buildings, so that grants of timber were made in 1226 to build the infirmary chapel, in 1231 to repair the cloister and the nuns' stalls, in 1234-1235 for work on the church, further grants e in 1241 and 1249. For roofing the canons’ church in 1246 there was a grant of lead. Edward I made a gift of timber in 1300, when his daughter Mary was a nun in the house. Amesbury Priory seems to have conformed to a general tendency in England as the Middle Ages waned for the proportion of aristocratic nuns in nunneries to decline. An example of this can be seen in the Abbey of the Minoresses of St. Clare without Aldgate in London, whose initial heavy royal connections seem to have imparted from the outset a certain cachet to the houseCf. Nancy Bradley Warren, Spiritual Economies: Female Monasticism in Later Medieval England, University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 2012, p. 58. such that in the early days aspiring nuns had to be of noble birth,W.E. Hampton, The Ladies of the Minories, in The Ricardian 4 (1978) 15-22. whereas by the 14th century the daughters of wealthy merchants were also entering.Cf. Caroline Barron & Anne F. Sutton (edd.), Medieval London Widows, 1300-1500, Hambledon Press, London, 1994, p. 82. At Amesbury a similar trend became marked by the early 16th century,Paul Lee, Nunneries, Learning, and Spirituality in Late Medieval English Society, York Medieval Press, York, 2001, p. 58; Yvonne Parrey, Devoted Disciples of Christ: Early Sixteenth Century Religious Life in the Nunnery at Amesbury’', in Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research 67 (1994) 240-248. the social recruitment pool there being the gentry families.Stephanie Jane Adams, Religion, Society and Godly Women: The Nature of Female Piety in a Late Medieval Urban Community, PhD thesis, University of Bristol, 2001, p. 117 [accessed 12 October 2017: https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33133796.pdf] It also seems that by the 15th century the close link between the royal family and Amesbury Priory that formerly existed had faded, so that when Henry VI visited the priory in 1435 it was a great rarety. On 2 October 1501 Princess Catherine of Aragon landed at Plymouth and proceeded by road via Exeter to her wedding to Arthur, Prince of Wales in Saint Paul's Cathedral on 14 November. At one of her halts she was brought to spend the night of 2 November at Amesbury Priory.H.F. Chettle, The English Houses of the Order of Fontevraud, in Downside Review 60(1942) 51. =The Amesbury Psalter= Page from the Amesbury Psalter (English, c. 1249) A 13th-century illuminated Psalter of English workmanship (All Souls College, Oxford, Ms. 6) is known as the Amesbury Psalter. Dated around c. 1250, it is one of a group of five illuminated manuscripts (comprising another psalter, a Missal, a Bible, and an Apocalypse). All were produced c. 1245-1255 and illuminated in that timeframe by an unknown artist. A consensus regards them as representing the attainment of maturity by the English early Gothic style. The Amesbury Psalter is regarded as the finest of them all and has been described as “the purest gem of English medieval painting”.Albert Holländer, “The Sarum Illuminator and his School”, in “Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine” 50 (1943) 230-262. It contains two mentions of the feasts of St Melor, the Amesbury patron Saint, but in other respects does not seem to follow exactly the Amesbury calendar and is likely to have been owned not by a nun but by a wealthy laywoman. It contains four full-page miniatures, as well as various illuminated initials.Description in Peter Brieger, English Art 1216-1307, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1937, pp. 174-175; cf. also Aimee E.H.

Women of Rank = Eleanor of Brittany= Eleanor of Brittany (1275-1342) was born in England as the daughter of John II, Duke of Brittany and Earl of Richmond and his wife Beatrice of England,Scott L. Waugh, The Lordship of England: Royal Wardships and Marriages in English Society and Politics, 1217-1327, Princeton University Press, 1988, p. 179. who was the daughter of Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence. It was the latter who arranged that her granddaughter would enter Amesbury Priory in 1281, at the age of seven, with a view to becoming a nun, though for that she had to wait until she reached the customary age. The girl had lost her mother Beatrice on 24 March 1275, shortly after her birth. She remained at Amesbury Priory the best part of a decade. In early 1286 she was joined by Mary of Woodstock, infant daughter of Edward I, also a granddaughter of Eleanor of Provence, and also waiting to become a nun. As a sign of personal earnest, her grandmother the queen mother purchased for her support both Chaddleworth manor along with the advowson of the local Poughley Priory (Berkshire), income from which young Eleanor enjoyed for life and then both passed into the possessions of Amesbury Priory.Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey, later priory, of Amesbury, in Ralph B. Pugh & Elizabeth Crittall (eds.), A History of the County of Wiltshire, vol. 3. London, 1956. p. 247. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/wilts/vol3/pp242-259 [accessed 29 September 2017]. Some months later still, in June 1286, the girls’ grandmother arrived in person to take up residence, not as a nun but as a pious royal widow. Gradual of Eleanor of Brittany, detail Ever since Eleanor of Brittany's arrival at Amesbury she had experienced not infrequent visits to the house by Edward I. In 1291 he came no less than three times: February 1291, for the burial of Eleanor of Provence, in September 1291 and yet again in November. During the latter visit the still young Eleanor, now aged about 17, took the veil in the King's presence. For whatever reason, shortly afterwards she moved to the mother house Fontevraud Abbey. There she would in due course take her vows and become a nun. By 1304 she was abbess there. It is known that both Eleanor and Mary were at Amesbury rather than Fontevraud, largely at the instance of their grandmother, against the wishes of King Edward I’s Queen, Eleanor of Castile. The death of her grandmother doubtless meant that the young Eleanor was both under less constraint and to some extent enjoyed less immediate protection. Perhaps, too, she and her closer family felt that her future more naturally lay on the Continent, especially given the divide opened up by Edward I's general imperialism and his renewal of military operations to secure territories for the English crown there. Perhaps, too, Amesbury was a little too crowded with princesses. Upon Eleanor of Brittany's induction as the sixteenth abbess of Fontevraud, a richly illuminated Gradual was presented to her. This she bequeathed to the abbey. It survives to this day and is conserved in the public library of Limoges. =Mary of Woodstock= Mary of Woodstock Mary of Woodstock, born 11/12 March 1279, was a younger daughter of King Edward I and his wife Eleanor of Castile. It would seem that both Mary and her cousin Eleanor of Brittany had in the first instance been destined to enter Amesbury's mother house at Fontevraud, but that their grandmother Eleanor of Provence, had convinced her son the King, Edward I, to send them instead to Amesbury. There seems to have been no doubt in the family that both were destined to become nuns. At the age of seven, Mary underwent what was most probably a ceremony of oblation at Amesbury on Assumption Day, 15 August 1285, though she did not receive the veil as a nun (or more likely as a novice) until December 1291, when she had reached the age of twelve.Berenice M. Kerr, Religious life for women, c. 1100-c. 1350: Fontevraud in England, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1999, p. 240; Mary Anne Everett Green, Lives of the Princesses of England from the Norman Conquest, vol. 2, London, 1849, pp.404-442, at 409. With the death of her grandmother at Amesbury in 1291, it was apparently expected that Mary would move to Fontevraud, as Eleanor of Brittany in fact did. The prioress of Fontevraud wrote several times to Edward I to this end. Possibly to prevent his daughter falling into French hands in the event of war with England, Edward refused, and Mary remained at Amesbury, while her allowance was doubled to £200 per year. In 1292, she was also given the right to forty oaks per year from royal forests and twenty tuns of wine per year from Southampton. In 1293 Mary can be seen, now freed from the shadow of her grandmother, intervening in the internal running of the priory. That year she contested the election of a prioress and was presumably the prime mover through the king for the importation of a new prioress from Fontevraud, then confirmed by the king, who in connection with the whole affair issued detailed orders on a large scale concerning both spiritualities and temporalities and personally visited Amesbury in August 1293 and August 1294. Hostilities between England and France throughout the Middle Ages occasioned problems for monasteries in England that had French connections. When war broke out again in 1294, contacts with the mother house must have been impeded. It may have been for that reason that the Abbess of Fontevraud, some time before March 1300, appointed the Princess Mary her vicegerent in England, and as such Mary is known to have issued several documents in the period 1301-1309. In one dated 1301 she assumes the grand style \\"Maria illustris regis Anglie nata vices reverende matris domine Margarete dei gracia Fontis Ebraudi abbatisse in Anglia gerens\\" (“Mary daughter of the illustrious King of England, vicegerent of the Reverend mother Dame Margaret, by the grace of God Abbess of Fontevraud”). In 1309 there was another vacancy for prioress at Amesbury and Mary proposed that the abbess (by then it was Eleanor of Brittany) appoint an Amesbury nun. When Eleanor favoured appointing instead a French prioress and prior, it was Mary, through the king, who nevertheless prevailed. In about 1317 Mary's special status lapsed but the king and the pope secured its renewal for her.Mary Anne Everett Green, Lives of the Princesses of England from the Norman Conquest, vol. 2, London, 1849, pp. 439-441. From the outset, Mary had been amply provided for. She was the object of personal endowments with lands, which were on various occasions increased. Her parents granted her £100 per year for life and she also received double the usual allowance for clothing and a special entitlement to wine from the stores. Additionally, there were in any case gifts of fuel and wine specifically for her.Berenice M. Kerr, Religious life for women, c. 1100-c. 1350: Fontevraud in England, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1999, pp. 115-116. Her father visited her and Eleanor at the priory repeatedly: twice in 1286 and in 1289, and again in 1290 and three times in 1291. These visits, though less frequent as the years went by, nevertheless continued even after the death of Edward's mother Queen Eleanor in 1291. Edward was at Amesbury in 1297, 1302 and in 1305, his last visit, when he was accompanied by his Queen and a large retinue.Mary Anne Everett Green, Lives of the Princesses of England from the Norman Conquest, vol. 2, London, 1849, p.426. Mary's life as a nun of Amesbury, rather than exemplifying the dedication and earnestness of a Benedictine nun, resembled more the trivialities of the court and included absences for travel outside the enclosure. She was known to administer her various landholdings in person, travelling between them,Mary Anne Everett Green, Lives of the Princesses of England from the Norman Conquest, vol. 2, London, 1849, p. 409. and when resident lived in comfort in private quarters.Berenice M. Kerr, Religious life for women, c. 1100-c. 1350: Fontevraud in England, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1999, p. 110. Mary's mother, Eleanor of Castile, had died in 1290 and her father had remarried. In 1305 she was included in the entourage of the new Queen,Laura Barefield, Lineage and Women's Patronage: Mary of Woodstock and Nicholas Trevett's \\"Les Cronicles\\", in Medieval Feminist Forum 35 (2003) 21. her stepmother the young Margaret of France, who being born c. 1279 was close to her own age. In fact, Mary is reported to have visited court on various occasions and to have run up large gambling debts there at dice. That same year 1305 she was given £200 to pay these off.Mary Anne Everett Green, Lives of the Princesses of England from the Norman Conquest, vol. 2, London, 1849, pp. 421, 431, 434. None of this was the behaviour of a run-of-the-mill nun. Yet though there had been friction with the Abbess of Fontevraud, Mary continued to live comfortably. As to her later frivolities, it is recorded that in 1316 she was able to borrow more than £2 from abbey funds and sent a clerk to London on personal errands, at the priory's expense.Berenice M. Kerr, Religious life for women, c. 1100-c. 1350: Fontevraud in England, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1999, p. 115 Because of her high status, several nobles who had decided their daughters would become nuns, entrusted them to Mary's custody.A. Rutherford, The Anglo- Norman Chronicles of Nicholas Trivet, unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of London, 1932; Laura Barefield, Lineage and Women's Patronage: Mary of Woodstock and Nicholas Trevett's \\"Les Cronicles\\", in Medieval Feminist Forum 35 (2003) 21-30. In this the royal family had probably given an example. Mary's half-sister, Eleanor of England (born 4 May 1306), her father's daughter by his second wife, Margaret of France, died in 1311 when still only five at Amesbury Abbey,Michael Prestwich. Edward I, University of California Press, 1988, p. 131; Mary Anne Everett Green, Lives of the Princesses of England from the Norman Conquest, vol. 3, London, 1849, p. 61. though she was buried not there but at Beaulieu Abbey, a male Cistercian monastery in Hampshire,Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, p. 88. Having never been (and therefore having doubtless never wanted to be) prioress of Amesbury, Mary died on 29 May 1332 and was probably buried in Amesbury. After her death, John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, who was then attempting to divorce Mary's niece Joan of Bar, claimed to have had an affair with Mary before he married Joan (they married on 25 May 1306). Had John's claim been true, his marriage to Mary's niece would have been rendered null and void, but despite papal mandates for inquests to be made into the matter, the truth was never established.Thomas Frederick Tout, Warenne, John de (1286-1347), in Dictionary of National Biography, Smith, Elder & Co. London, vol. 59, 1899. =Queen Eleanor= Queen Eleanor Eleanor of Provence, the widow of Henry III of England, took the decision to retire to Amesbury Priory, just as Henry's widow, Eleanor of Aquitaine, had taken up residence at the mother abbey, Fontevraud, in its early years. While for some years she had been a visitor and patron to Amesbury, obtaining also various favourable measures for it from the King, with Eleanor of Provence's arrival at Amesbury in June 1286Margaret Howell, Eleanor of Provence: Queenship in Thirteenth- Century England, Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, 1998, p. 300. it was inevitable that her permanent presence would further radically change the nature and status of the house. For one thing, coupled with the entry there of his daughter Mary of Woodstock, some months earlier, it meant once again visits to the priory by the King, Edward I, who first went to Amesbury in 1275. Now he came to visit his mother, his daughter Mary and his niece Eleanor of Brittany on several further occasions: in March 1281, January and March 1286, October and November 1289, April 1290, February 1291 and again for her burial in September 1291. The visits of a King brought their own variety of disruption. For another thing, since it is recorded that the Princess Mary lived in comfort in private quarters,Berenice M. Kerr, Religious life for women, c. 1100-c. 1350: Fontevraud in England, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1999, p. 110 it is hardly thinkable that Queen Eleanor (who moreover was not a nun) would have less, and perhaps likewise other women of rank living in the house at various periods. In this way, it was unavoidable that the concentration of the priory on prayer and spirituality should suffer, and perhaps its corporate finances. On the other hand, the presence of members of the royal family undoubtedly would have kept the house from oblivion and given a measure of protection, though only at times. Queen Eleanor died at Amesbury on 24 or 25 June 1291 and on 11 September following was solemnly entombed there before the high altar of the priory church in the presence of her son the King, Edward I, and many prelates and nobles. Her heart was taken to London and buried at Greyfriars, Newgate, London. The exact location of the tomb at Amesbury has been lost and the buildings of Greyfriars, London were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. = Prioress Isabel of Lancaster= From 1343 to her death some time before February 1349, the Prioress of Amesbury was Isabel of Lancaster, born possibly around 1305 or 1307. With 35 other nuns she had been consecrated a virgin by John Droxford, Bishop of Bath and Wells at Amesbury on Ascension Day 1327. One of the other women with her that day had been another future prioress, Isabel's successor, Margery of Purbrook. Seal of Isabel's father, Henry of Lancaster 1301 Isabel was a daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and Maud Chaworth, a lineage which made her a great-granddaughter of King Henry III. At a very young age she had been placed under the protection of Mary of Woodstock (1279-1332), daughter of Edward I and Eleanor of Castile, who was a nun of Amesbury. In the spring of 1317, Isabel went with Mary and her niece and protégée Elizabeth de Clare on a pilgrimage to Canterbury.Mary Anne Everett Green, Lives of the Princesses of England, vol. 2, Colburn, 1850, pp. 434-435. This episode is revealing of aspects of the situation at Amesbury Priory at the time. Mary was then a woman of 38, while Isabel must only have been a very young girl at the time, barely in her teens, but was already living at Amesbury. Elizabeth, born on 16 September 1295, at 22 years old, would have been considerably senior to Isabel but was already twice widowed and had a child by each of her late husbands. She was to marry and be widowed for a third time and was of one of the richest and most influential women of the fourteenth century. On the death from typhoid of her second husband, Theobald II de Verdun, on 27 July 1316, his widow Elizabeth fled, pregnant, to the protection of her aunt Mary at Amesbury Priory. The child, Isabel de Verdun, had been born on 21 March 1317,The Complete Peerage, vol. XII, p. 252. so the pilgrimage might have been undertaken to give thanks for the safe birth. Isabel had an only brother, Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and five sisters, including the formidable Maud of Lancaster, Countess of Ulster, who after the murder of her first husband, William de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, had lived for a time at the court of King Edward III with the royal family. In 1347, the by then twice-widowed Maud also entered a nunnery, in her case Campsey Priory, a house of Augustinian canonesses near Wickham Market in Suffolk, but in 1364 she transferred to the Poor Clares community at Bruisyard Abbey, where she died and was buried in 1377. Styled regularly in various contemporary documents as the \\"King’s cousin\\" or the \\"King’s kinswoman\\", Isabel was able to use her family connections to obtain privileges and concessions for the priory. In 1340 the King, Edward III, granted her three tuns of wine annually for life and in 1345 twelve oaks yearly from the royal forest of Chute.Douglas Richardson, Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, vol. 1, Everington, Salt Lake City, 2nd edition 2001, p. 529; Henry Murray Lane, The Royal Daughters of England, and their Representatives: together with genealogical tables of the Royal Family from the Conquest to the present time, Constable, London, 1911, p. 140; Ralph B. Pugh, Fragment of an Account of Isabel of Lancaster, Nun of Amesbury, 1333-4, in L. Santifaller (ed.), Festschrift zur Feier des zweihundertjährigen Bestandes des Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchivs, Band 1., Wien, 1949 (= Mitteilungen des Österreichischen Staatsarchivs, Ergänzungsband 2), pp. 487-498. Isabel became Prioress in 1343, the year after the death of Eleanor of Brittany, abbess of Fontevraud. Like Eleanor and Mary of Woodstock, Isabel seems to have had little genuine vocation to be a nun. She owned four hunting dogs, for example, gave and received expensive gifts, and had personal servants. Her father Henry had settled some property on her, which she administered personally. As did Abbess Eleanor, Isabel spent a great deal of time outside the cloister, on decidedly non-spiritual matters. Whether and in what manner her activities and those of other resident royal ladies were a financial burden on the monastery may have been to some degree invisible to the formal accounts, but the priory's spending on the keep of the nuns was higher than average among English nunneries. Moreover, considerable sums of money were paid annually to the priory's senior lay administrators, even for servants for them. This is perhaps an indicator of the readiness to facilitate the existence of ladies who wielded considerable power.Jenni Butterworth, Monastic Sites and Monastic Estates in Somerset and Wiltshire in the Middle Ages: A Regional Approach, PhD thesis, Bristol, 1999, vol II, pp. 303-304. =Prioress Sybil Montagu= Arms of Montagu: Argent, three fusils conjoined in fess gules Not half a century after Isabel of Lancaster, the prioress was Sybil Montagu, a woman not of the same rank, but still well-placed by birth as a niece of William Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, and sister of John Montagu, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, and of Thomas Montagu, who was Dean of Salisbury from 1382.Douglas Richardson, Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, vol. 1, Everington, Salt Lake City, 2nd edition 2001, p. 157. While the date of her entry as a nun is not recorded, Sybil became prioress around 1391David M. Smith (ed.), The Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, III. 1377-1540, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008, p. 621. On her watch not all was well, for in 1398 a nun, Margaret Greenfield, gave birth to a child. Perhaps unrelated to this, that same year Sybil she had the elderly Prior Robert Daubeneye thrown out of the monastery. The mixed royal and ecclesiastical enquiries into the resulting uproar compromised by saving the reputation of the Prior and ordering the granting of a pension, but not reinstating him in the house. However, Dame Sybil had sown the seeds of a storm and on 14 March 1400 the monastery was invaded after nightfall by ruffians who imprisoned Sybil and some of the nuns for at least two days. It took the involvement of Henry IV and his orders to officers of the crown to free them and restore order. In 1415 there was another episode where Dame Sybil claimed to have been ejected from the monastery and to be afraid to enter it again. This time it was Henry V who had to intervene. Once again Dame Sybil seems to have navigated the rapids and kept her post. She was to die only in 1420.Malcolm Vale, Henry V: The Conscience of a King, Yale University Press, New Haven, 2016, p. 193. Another royal burial Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany Eleanor of Brittany, known as the Fair Maid of Brittany (died 1241), was the eldest daughter of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, the fourth son of King Henry II of England, and hence was the latter's granddaughter. Having lost her father at the age of two, she and was brought up by her uncle Richard I, King of England and grandmother Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine.Douglas Richardson, Plantagenet Ancestry: a study in colonial and medieval families. 2004, p.6 With the presumed death in 1203 of her brother, Arthur, she became heiress to vast lands including England, Anjou, and Aquitaine as well as Brittany. In none of them did the Salic Law barring the accession of females apply. Given that she was heir to her father, who was Henry II's fourth son, while John, King of England, was only Henry's fifth son, she posed a strong threat to the claims of her uncle, and of his successor, her cousin, Henry III.W. Stubbs (ed.), Annales Londonienses and Annales Paulini, London, 1882, p. 38 The brutal solution was to keep her a prisoner for the rest of her days, and so she was detained in various locations in England from 1202 until her death in 1241. Having been initially buried at St James' Priory, Bristol, she was then reburied only a month or so later at Amesbury Abbey, which Henry III announced was her chosen resting place.H.R. Luard (ed.), Annales Monastici, vol. I, London, 1864, p. 118. Neither burial place has a memorial for her remains.B.C.A. Windle, Bristol, a historical and topographical account of the city, p. 159. Henry also granted the priory the rich manor of Melksham in suffrage for her soul and that of her brother Arthur (who was widely believed to have been murdered by King John of England) and eventually for his own and that of his queen.V.C.H. Wilts. vii, 95 seq. The Priory Seal The seal of the Priory at some periods at least seems to have depicted the Coronation of the Virgin Mary, which is not a particularly common motif in medieval English nunneries.Roberta Gilchrist, Gender and Material Culture: The Archaeology of Religious Women, Routledge, London, 1994, pp. 143, 145. In other seals of the Priory, as for example one datable to 1337-1345, the image depicted is of the prioress standing.Roberta Gilchrist, Gender and Material Culture: The Archaeology of Religious Women, Routledge, London, 1994, p. 144. Dissolution In the early months of 1539 John Tregonwell,Anthony N. Shaw, The Compendium Compertorium and the Making of the Suppression Act of 1536, PhD thesis, University of Warwick, 2003, pp. 136-149 [accessed 12 October 2017: http://go.warwick.ac.uk/wrap/1262]. William Petre,F.G. Emmison, Tudor Secretary: Sir William Petre at Court and Home, London, 1961. and John Smyth visited over 40 houses on behalf of the government to solicit their surrender.Martin Heale, The Abbots and Priors of Late Medieval and Reformation England, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2016, p. 322. On 29 March 1539 they reached Amesbury Priory, after two other nunneries, Shaftesbury Abbey and Wilton Abbey, in both of which the abbess had declined initially to surrender. At Amesbury, too, they failed to persuade Dame Florence Bonnewe to surrender. On 30 March 1539 the three signed a letter to Thomas Cromwell reporting \\"we have used as many wayes with her as o[ur] pore witte cowed atteyne yet in theende we cowed not by any p[er]suasions bringe her to any conformitye but at all tymes she rested and soo remayneth in theis termes: yf the kinge’s highness commande me to goo from thys howse I will gladlye goo though I begge my breade\\". She refused talk of a pension and only asked to be left in peace.Susan Guinn-Chipman, Religious Space in Reformation England: Contesting the Past, Routledge, London, 2013, p. 19. In August other commissioners tried and succeeded, persuading Dame Florence to resign her office “at the king’s bidding”.Cf. David Knowles & R. Neville Hadcock, Medieval Religious Houses, England and Wales, Longman Greens, London 1953, p. 209. On 4 December her successor, Joan Darrell, surrendered the priory without resistance. It has been noted that there is a difficulty in knowing whether Dame Florence had been prioress continuously since or before the date when her name is first mentioned as such in 1523 and whether and when Joan Darrell had already served as prioress. The facts are that Florence Bonnewe appears as prioress in 1523, 1524, 1527, 1535 and 1539 but Joan Darrell as prioress in 1536, 1537, 1538 and 1539.David M. Smith (ed.), The Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, III. 1377-1540, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008, pp. 621-622; H.F. Chettle, The English Houses of the Order of Fontevraud, in Downside Review 60 (1942) 33-55. The annual gross income of the monastery in 1535 was £558 10s. 2d, net £482 1s. 10d. This made it the fifth wealthiest among nunneries in England. Its net value at the surrender was £525 9s. d.H.F. Chettle, The English Houses of the Order of Fontevraud, in Downside Review 60 (1942) 54; Jenni Butterworth, Monastic Sites and Monastic Estates in Somerset and Wiltshire in the Middle Ages: A Regional Approach, PhD thesis, Bristol, 1999, vol II, p. 379. A patent of 4 February 1540 granted a total of £258 6s. 8d. in pensions to Prioress Darrell (£100) and to 33 nuns (an average of a little less than £5 each), of these 21 nuns were still receiving pensions in 1555-1556, with Cecily Eyre still a beneficiary as late as 1605. Dame Florence Bonnewe had asked for a pension \\"during the litle tyme that it shall pleas God to graunte me to lyve\\" but what the amount was (or if there was any grant at all) is not known. Four priests are mentioned as receiving a payment of some kind, possible back wages.H.F. Chettle, The English Houses of the Order of Fontevraud, in Downside Review 60 (1942) 33-55. The property Church of St Mary and St Melor, Amesbury Some think that the Amesbury parish church, the Church of St Mary and St Melor, is the former priory church or perhaps the men's church, but this is debated. In any case, the present church is a Grade I listed building. The Amesbury Priory buildings were subsequently obtained from the Crown before 22 April 1540 by Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford,John Chandler & Peter Goodhugh, Amesbury: History and Description of a South Wiltshire Town, The Amesbury Society, Amesbury, 1989, p. 24 a nephew to Jane Seymour, Queen consort of Henry VIII, and the eldest son of her brother, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of England during the minority of King Edward VI, the Earl's cousin, with whom he had been educated in infancy.Albert Frederick Pollard, \\"Seymour, Edward (1539?–1621)\\", in Dictionary of National Biography, vol. 51, 1897. Literary allusions Sir Thomas Malory’s long poem Le Morte d'Arthur reworked old folk tales of the legendary King Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin, and the Knights of the Round Table, drawing on existing French and English stories. Malory (c. 1415-1471) was familiar with the Fontevraud daughter house at Nuneaton,Edward Hicks, Sir Thomas Malory: His Turbulent Career, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts 1928, pp. 25-27; Gweneth Whitteridge, The Identity of Sir Thomas Malory, Knight- Prisoner, in The Review of English Studies 24:95 (1973) 257-265. and given the royal connections of its sister house at Amesbury he chose Amesbury as the monastery to which Guinevere retires as “abbas and rular”,Eugene Vinaver & P.J.C. Field (edd.), The Works of Sir Thomas Malory, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 3rd edition 1990, vol. 3, p. 1249, lines 2-3. to find her salvation in a life of penance.On Malory’s Guinevere, see Peter Korrel, An Arthurian Triangle: A Study of the Origin, Development and Characterization of Arthur, Guinevere and Mordred, Brill, Leiden, 1984; Fiona Tolhurst, The Once and Future Queen: The Development of Guenevere from Geoffrey of Monmouth to Malory, in Bibliographical Bulletin of the International Arthurian Society 50 (1998) 272-308; Sue Ellen Holbrook, Guenevere: the Abbess of Amesbury and the Mark of Reparation in Arthuriana 20: 1 (2010) 25-51. The work was first published in 1485 by William Caxton. Current interest Apart from the importance of the Priory among English monastic houses and a revival of focus on its parent Order of Fontevraud, the fact of being, like its parent Order, a structure in which men were ruled by women lends Amesbury Priory a certain freshness of interest in our time.Cf. the approaches of Gabrielle Esperdy, The Royal Abbey of Fontevrault: Religious Women and the Shaping of Gendered Space, in Journal of International Women's Studies 6: 2 (2006) 59–80. http://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol6/iss2/5 [accessed 29 September 2017]; and Fiona J.

It is one of a confederation of 12 national members of CARE International, forming one of the world’s largest international emergency aid and development assistance organisations. It was founded in 1987 by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser who led it until 2002. CARE Australia’s projects are funded primarily through community donation, which has secured additional support from institutional partners such as the Australian government, European Union, and the World Health Organization. In 2008, 88 per cent of CARE Australia’s total revenue went into overseas projects. History Australia became a national member of CARE International in 1987, when it was founded by former Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Malcolm Fraser, AC, CH. Fraser was Chair 1987 to 2002 and for five of those years ('90 to '95) he was also President of CARE International. It grew through the 1990s, delivering disaster assistance and development programs to those in need. Fraser's daughter, Phoebe Fraser, became a CARE worker and together they were the faces of the organisation's fundraising.http://guides.naa.gov.au/malcolm-fraser/chapter1/1.9.aspx Malcolm Fraser: Guide to Archives of Australia's Prime Ministers, essay by Dr. Margaret Simons Aims CARE's mission is to serve individuals and families in the poorest communities in the world. This is done by: * strengthening capacity for self-help, * providing economic opportunity, * delivering relief in emergencies, * influencing policy decisions, * addressing discrimination. Emergency response CARE has a team of emergency professionals to assist in immediate relief and long-term rehabilitation for communities that are impacted by man-made or natural disasters. They provide communities with support, shelter, food, sanitation, and health facilities in times of crisis, as well as working with those that are vulnerable to disasters to reduce their future impact. CARE has provided emergency relief to those affected by emergencies such as Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar (Burma), post-election violence in Kenya, the 2013 Balochistan earthquakes, and the Boxing Day tsunami. It is involved in aid to devastated areas affected by 2015's Cyclone Pam. Development projects CARE Australia’s focus is on the support of women and girls in developing countries to create long term sustainability in the fight against poverty. Their long-term projects cover community development including: * Agriculture and food security – CARE helps families produce more food and increase their income while managing their natural resources and preserving the environment, * Education – CARE promotes discussion between parents, teachers and other members of the community to overcome the barriers to education that can keep families in a cycle of poverty, * Health – CARE helps communities enjoy better health, with a special focus on mothers and children, by improving their access to quality health services, nutrition, family planning, immunisation and HIV awareness and prevention, * Economic development – CARE assists impoverished families by supporting money-making activities, especially those operated by women, * Nutrition – CARE teaches practices that help prevent malnutrition, including demonstrating breast feeding, cultivating and preparing nutritious food, providing food as part of emergency relief efforts, and managing food-for-work projects to help communities improve infrastructure, * Water, Sanitation, and Environmental Health – CARE helps communities build and maintain clean water systems and latrines and educates people about good hygiene practice to reduce the risk of illness.

He also played for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1909), the Gentlemen of England (1910) and H.D.G. Leveson-Gower's XI (1911). Military career Lupton was commissioned a second lieutenant in The Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire Regiment) on 5 May 1900. He served with the 2nd battalion of his regiment in South Africa during the Second Boer War 1899-1900, and took part in operations in Natal March–June 1900, and in Transvaal, east and west of Pretoria, July–November 1900. Following the war he received the Queen's South Africa Medal with three clasps, and he was promoted to Lieutenant on 10 January 1902. Cricket career Born in Little Horton, Bradford, Yorkshire, England, Lupton had a modest overall record, despite the large number of games that he played. A left-handed batsman, he scored 724 runs at 10.34 with a highest score of 43 not out against Nottinghamshire in 1926. He took 14 wickets (none of them for Yorkshire) at 32.50 with his occasional right-arm fast-medium, with a best analysis for 4 for 109 for Gentlemen of England against Cambridge University in 1910. His chief contribution was as Yorkshire's captain. Having playing only one game for the county, back in 1908, he was appointed captain for the 1925 season at the age of 46. Yorkshire won the County Championship that year with 21 wins and no losses. He then led the side to second place in 1926 and third in 1927. He wanted to continue in 1928, but the Yorkshire committee, after at first deciding to appoint a professional captain, changed their minds and chose the amateur William Worsley.Stephen Chalke, Summer's Crown: The Story of Cricket's County Championship, Fairfield Books, Bath, 2015, pp. 132-33.

Since March 1982, he has been in a coma following an operation. Early life Adams was born and raised in Dakar until the age of 10, when he left his native Senegal on a pilgrimage to Montargis in the Loiret department alongside his grandmother, who was a devout Catholic. When they arrived, she enlisted him at a local Catholic school, Saint-Louis de Montargis. He was adopted by a French couple shortly after his arrival in the country. During his studies, Adams worked at a local rubber manufacturer and he started playing football at several local clubs in the Loiret area. Club career Adams started playing with RC Fontainebleau in 1967 as a striker, with whom he won the Championnat de France amateur twice. In 1970, he signed a contract with Nîmes Olympique, going on to remain in Division 1 for the following nine seasons, also representing OGC Nice and Paris Saint-Germain FC. In the 1971–72 campaign, Adams contributed with four goals in all 38 games to help Nîmes to a best-ever second place, also winning the Cup of the Alps. He added a career-best nine for Nice in 1973–74, for a final fifth position. After one year in Division 2 with FC Mulhouse, Adams retired in 1981 at the age of 33, following a spell with amateurs FC Chalon. International career On 15 June 1972, Adams made his debut for the French national team in an unofficial exhibition game against an African XI selected by the Confederation of African Football. His first competitive cap came on 13 October of that year, in a 1–0 home win against the Soviet Union for the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Adams' last appearance occurred on 1 September 1976, in a friendly with Denmark. During his tenure with Les Bleus, he formed a stopper partnership with Marius Trésor which was dubbed La garde noire (black guard). Personal life and injury Adams and his wife Bernadette were married in April 1969 and had two sons, Laurent (born 1969) and Frédéric (1976). Following a ligament rupture injury, he was hospitalised for surgery on 17 March 1982 at the Édouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon. After an error made by his anaesthetist, he suffered a bronchospasm which starved his brain of oxygen and he slipped into a coma. In the mid 1990s, when a court of law adjudicated on the case, both the anesthetist and trainee were given one-month suspended sentences and fines that translated to a $815 fine. His wife continued to tend to his needs, refusing to consider euthanasia.

The rush was touched off in March 1851 when a Haida man sold a 27-ounce nugget in Fort Victoria for 1,500 blankets. The crew of the Hudson's Bay Company vessel Una were the first to mine, discovering a vein 6.5\\" wide, 80' long at 25% gold content. As the crew began blasting, Haida would rush into the blast site to gather gold, competing with the crew. The Haida, according to the ship's log book, grabbed crewmen by the legs to prevent them from reaching the gold. Half the gold found was abandoned, along with the mine, to avoid bloodshed between the two parties, but each had taken in roughly $1,500 in gold ($60,000 in modern dollars) as the yield from three blasts. On her return voyage, Una was wrecked off Neah Bay and her gold lost. The Hudson's Bay Company, having no other ship available, did not attempt to mine in the Charlottes again. Of several American ships to visit the Charlottes during the rush, the first, Georgiana, was wrecked on the east coast of the Charlottes and her crew taken captive by Haida. Her crew's freedom was bartered back by the next vessel to come northwards, which had put in at Mitchell Harbour but returned south to Olympia to refit for the return trip to rescue the Georgiana's crew (the Haida burned Georgiana herself). In 1852, ten American ships came to the Charlottes in search of gold, but hostility from Haida throughout the islands made mining and prospecting difficult, and most actual mining was prevented. Among these ten vessels was the Susan Sturgis, which traded along the coast and at Skidegate was befriended by Chief Edenshaw, who joined the crew as guide and interpreter, bringing along with him some of his own men. Pulling into Masset Inlet to trade, the vessel was suddenly mass-boarded by the Masset Haida, who fought with Edenshaw and his few men who were trying to protect the crew. Word reached Chief Trader John Work at Fort Simpson in ten days and Work arrived to negotiate the release of Susan Sturgis' crew at the rate of $250 each for captain and mate, and $30 for each of the men (i.e. at the dollar equivalent in blankets). The vessel could not be saved because the Masset looted and destroyed her. The total value of gold recovered from the Queen Charlottes Rush was reckoned to be in the range of three hundred dollars. The rush was complicated by the fact that in 1851 the Queen Charlotte archipelago, though recognized by treaty as British, was as yet unincorporated as a formal possession or colony. With American ships converging on Mitchell Harbour (Mitchell Inlet) on Moresby Island, which was the main port for rush activity, the islands came to the attention of the British Colonial Office, which in 1853 appointed Vancouver Island Governor James Douglas as governor of a new Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Colonial status arrived, however, long after the rush was over. The Queen Charlotte Colony, which effectively existed on paper only since the governor's power was barely exercised in the archipelago, was quietly absorbed into the Colony of British Columbia in 1863.

It is one of three areal divisions of the Province of Pavia. Lomellina (Office of Tourism of Lombardy) Geography Lomellina includes 58 comuni (municipalities), the most important today being Vigevano and Mortara; the name however derives from its ancient capital Lomello. The area is particularly renowned for its rice paddies: the crop has been cultivated here since the sixteenth century. History In ancient times Lomellina was inhabited by the Ligurian tribes of the Laevi, and the Marici (co-founders of Ticinum, the modern Pavia) and the Libici (founders of Vercelli). Later they were Romanized. Although crossed by an important road connecting Ticinum to Augusta Taurinorum (the modern Turin), the region seems not to have been intensively urbanized under the Romans, with the exception of the area of Vigevano. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the arrival of the Lombards, who set their capital in Pavia, Lomellina acquired importance, with a comital dynasty (Conti di Lomello) rising in Lomello. The city of Pavia conquered Lomello in 1146, and the area was later under the Visconti, as part of the Duchy of Milan. In 1707, after the War of the Spanish Succession, a part of Lomellina was conquered by the Piedmontese House of Savoy and made an autonomous province. The area of Vigevano and Robbio, called Contado di Vigevano and which had been autonomous since 1532, was also acquired by Piedmont in 1743. In 1859 the administrative reform promoted by Urbano Rattazzi annexed Lomellina to the province of Pavia just conquered from Austria, becoming later part of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy.

It was founded in 1936 in San Giuseppe Vesuviano as Football Club Sangiuseppese and it played here from 1936 until 2008. After its bankruptcy in 2008 it was taken over and renamed Football Club Neapolis Mugnano and played in Mugnano di Napoli. History =Foundation= The club started its life as Football Club Sangiuseppese, it was founded in 1936 in the Province of Naples town San Giuseppe Vesuviano. The club wore yellow and blue shirts, known in Italy as gialloblù, starting their league performances in Terza Divisione. These early seasons were not very successful and the club commonly finished bottom. Sangiuseppese eventually gained promotion to Seconda Divisione in 1939, their efforts in Second Divisione saw them reach the quarter-finals of the end-grouping. For a brief period after World War II, the club played in Serie C for the 1946–47 and 1947–48 seasons. After that the club fell into obscurity. 1970–71 saw the club return to more notable success, they were competing in Seconda Categoria and won promotion from it to the Prima Categoria. Four years after this, the club achieved another promotion and they were placed into the Promozione Campania; club trainers during this period included Montalto, Improta, Sgambato, Ambrosio and Lovless respectively. Sangiuseppese won promotion up into the Interregionale league after 1980–81, today's equivalent is Serie D. Spilabotte's goals helped the club during the two seasons they spent up in it. They competed against clubs such as Crotone, Juve Stabia and Savoia before being relegated. The relegation itself in 1982–83 was difficult for the club to take as two teams who survived had the same number of points as them, but Sangiuseppese had a worse goal difference. After their relegation the club played in regional competitions such as Promozione Campania and would only gain promotion from it in 1988–89. =Pro Sangiuseppese in Serie C2= For the first time in their history, the club gained promotion from Serie D after just one season back in the league, this meant Sangiuseppese would be competing in Serie C2. In this division they performed respectably, ending 3rd in their first season, missing out on promotion to Ischia Isolaverde and Acireale. The following two seasons, they did not pose a threat in the championship race, but consistently finished in the top half of the table. By 1994 the club had begun to decline in form and just a year later they suffered a relegation to Serie D (known as C.N.D. at the time). They were unable to bounce straight back to Serie C2 and after a mid-table finish, Sangiuseppese became defunct because of financial difficulties in 1996. However, by 1997 the club had been refounded under the name Pro Sangiuseppese after a team from the city called Scalese took action to rename their club to carry on the legacy of Sangiuseppese; Pro Sangiuseppese started their first season back in the Promozione Campania, which was successfully captured in the 1997–98 season. This was followed up by becoming champions of Eccellenza Campania, beating out Ottaviano by one point. Into the new millennium Pro Sangiuseppese were back in Serie D, returning with a 4th-place finish above established regional sides such as Sorrento and Frosinone. Although promotion eluded them, on the field the 2000s were somewhat of a stable time for the club; they finished in the top 10 for seven consecutive seasons. Off the field, Sangiuseppese were having problems and became bankrupt in 2006.

The land gives its name to a nearby chapel dedicated to Saint Lucy. In a notarial document dating from the 16th century, the area near this estate was known as bitalbarrani, that is, the stranger's or outsider's land. This name may indicate that the land under cultivation at Tal-Barrani belonged to some outsider, either someone from outside a village community, or a foreigner. Moreover, the same land contained another area which was called Tal-Misilmin (land of the Muslims). At least from the 17th century onwards, Tal-Barrani was a recognised agricultural estate, and was documented in the 1654 property book of the Order of St. John, the Cabreo Magisteriale. In the 1960s, a depot for Malta's milk collection system was built at Tal-Barrani. In October 1965, while constructing the depot, a number of archaeological remains were found in the middle of the building site. The site was later demolished, and a private hospital was built, leading to the finding of further tombs in 2008 and 2009. A Late Roman and Byzantine catacomb and a tomb were discovered and excavated in 1993, closer to Żejtun. Tal- Barrani is an important transportation link in the south-eastern part of the island, with a major road cutting the area in half. The existing road consists of a dual carriageway of two northbound and two southbound lanes separated by a central reserve. A €20 million road project is being proposed to divert traffic between Tal-Barrani Road and Vjal Santa Luċija via tunnels. Tal- Barrani was the site of political violence on 30 November 1986, when a group of people, some wearing balaclavas, began hurling stones and bottles on an approaching group of political activists. The clashes erupted with the appearance of members of the police’s Special Mobile Unit, who fired teargas canisters and rubber bullets onto the crowd, and mayhem ensued.  Geography and geology  The promontory of Żejtun is defined to the north by Wied iz- Ziju, which separates Żejtun from Ħal Tarxien and other outlying high ground. This valley includes the area known as Tal-Barrani. The land also gives its name to a type of uniform clay brown soil. In a number of areas in Malta and Gozo, a type of calcareous colluvium lies above a layer of terra fusca. If the colluvium is thin, the mixing of the two layers due to tilling over a long period of time will produce a uniform brown soil, very rich in clay. This type was classified as Tal-Barrani.  Archaeological remains  Tal-Barrani contains a significant number of archaeological remains. These include an ancient tomb cluster and field systems at the Tal-Ħotba site at Tal-Barrani, and a number of late Roman and Byzantine catacombs. A Christian catacomb and four rock-cut tombs were discovered in 1915, 1963 and 1993, under the present road footprint of Tal-Barrani. At least another seventeen tombs were discovered in 1965, 1966 and 2008 were found in fields in an area known as Tal-Ħotba, very close to Tal-Barrani road. The 1960s discoveries at Tal-Ħotba consisted of three tombs within the footprint of the old milk collection depot. = Ancient cluster of tombs and field systems = Three ancient Punic rock-cut tombs were uncovered and investigated by the Museums Department in 1965 and 1966 in the Tal-Ħotba area of Tal-Barrani. The tombs were uncovered during the construction of a milk depot on previously undeveloped agricultural land. In 2008, a development permit was issued for the demolition of this industrial building, to be replaced by a new private hospital. Construction works began under archaeological surveillance. By October 2008, rock-cut tombs discoveries were reported. Authorities started an extensive investigation of the land. By early 2009, fourteen rock-cut tombs were found and partially studied. Given the importance of this discovery, the authorities protected these remains, and began procedures for their scheduling. The developer proposed to redesign the development to guarantee the physical conservation of this important cluster of ancient tombs. The proposed hospital building was moved to a new site within the same property. A number of field trenches for agricultural purposes were also uncovered. = Late Roman and Byzantine catacombs = In May 1993, an important Late Roman to Byzantine burial site was uncovered during trenching works along Tal-Barrani road, on the approach to the higher ground before the 25 November Avenue crossroads leading to Żejtun. Two subterranean burial monuments were discovered within 10.0 metres from each other. These were a multi-chambered burial catacomb, and a Late Roman rock-cut chamber tomb. The catacomb was found on the Żejtun side of the hillock, at a higher point to the chamber tomb, which was found closer towards Ħal Tarxien. The discovery was important in that it contained the burial strata in their intact state. These survived and were sealed within the catacomb. Additionally, the Tal-Barrani catacomb was the first one to be examined scientifically. The presence of a Christian catacomb so close to a rock-cut chamber tomb is a rare occurrence, which is usually found only in the Rabat area. Tal-Barrani provides evidence of continuity in usage of a much larger communal cemetery; this was initially made up of chamber tombs and a multi-chambered catacomb. Discoveries in the same location are noted in Temi Żammit's archaeological notebooks, and in the Archaeological Museum's 1963 report. The burial ground was large, and it contained a mixture of tombs and other burial facilities. One of the skeletons discovered in 1993 showed evidence of an ankylosing spondylitis, and Forestier's disease, which is a chronic form of arthritis involving the spinal area. The Tal-Barrani road very likely formed part of older road networks, some of which date back to antiquity. The placing of burial tombs and catacombs by the side of main roads was not uncommon in the Maltese islands. The road was widened and realigned in modern times. As a result, some of the Tal-Barrani tombs were discovered, while others remained hidden under the old road surface. This may have preserved the catacomb. The rock-cut chamber tomb was cut into a natural terrace, which was later hidden by the modern Tal-Barrani road. Part of the tomb's shaft was hidden by the rubble wall of the previous and narrower Tal- Barrani road. This rubble wall is still preserved underneath the present central reserve. When the tomb was discovered, the sealing slab was still lodged securely. The tomb's structure was largely intact, except for the back section which was cut through by the modern trenching works. Apart from debris from the trenching works, the tomb chamber and contents were intact and undisturbed. The chamber contained two main areas, a rectangular burial site with a water trench cutting its middle, and an arcosolium at the back. The front area measured about 2.5 metres in length, slightly longer than the arcosolium which measured 2.1 metres. The water trench in the front provided standing room, and separated the two burial platforms. The water trench was reached by three steps leading down from the entrance, while the arcosolium was a focus point. It betrayed an unusual tomb design, which suggested a Late Roman date for the burials. The burial platform of the arcosolium included two carved head-rests.  Political violence  Tal-Barrani was the site of political violence on 30 November 1986, after the Nationalist Party decided to organise a political activity in Żejtun, a Labour Party stronghold. The Labour Party viewed this choice as a provocation, and the police withdrew a permit that had already been issued. The government, led by Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, cited public order concerns. The Nationalist Party insisted it had a right to organise political activities anywhere in Malta to exercise its freedom of expression. The Party went to court and in a tense sitting had its claim confirmed. The Constitutional Court authorised the Nationalist Party to hold a meeting in Żejtun on November 30, 1986. The party's general secretary Louis Galea had alerted the police of rumours that the meeting would be obstructed by government supporters. The roads to Żejtun were blocked with stones and rubble during the night of November 29, and the authorities did not take any action, even when this continued in their presence on November 30. When the Nationalist Party supporters approached, a small group of men tried to hold them back but eventually retreated behind a truck. The fully equipped Special Mobile Unit police then moved in, followed by over a hundred people, some of them masked and armed. The mounted police brought up the rear, with the police spraying tear gas and firing rubber bullets on the Nationalist Party supporters. Many shots were fired and people were injured, some seriously. The meeting had to be abandoned and the Nationalist Party supporters retreated followed by the \\"mixed army\\" of policemen and government supporters. The latter left a lot of damage in their wake, although one could not exclude that some Nationalist Party supporters also caused some damage, particularly to the cars of the police stationed at Tal-Barrani. Sixteen years later, three men were conditionally discharged for their part on the day.  Notes  : [A]. Bital misilmin, pecia terrae in contrata bitalbarrani: 15.xii.1527, Not. Gr.

A constituent university of the University of the Philippines system, it teaches management, accountancy, marketing, economics, chemistry, applied mathematics and physics, marine science education and research, fisheries, and aquaculture. It offers regional studies programs on the preservation and enrichment of the Visayan cultural heritage. UP Visayas has three campuses—Miagao, Iloilo City, and Tacloban—with Miagao being the main campus with its central administration offices. The University of the Philippines Cebu College was part of UP Visayas but it separated in September 2010, after being declared an autonomous unit. Most of the students of the university are drawn from the Visayas and the Visayan linguistic groups. Many of the leaders of the Visayas graduated from UPV or its predecessor institutions. As of 2007, the Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines awarded four National Centers of Excellence and Development to UPV including Fisheries (UPV-Miagao), Marine Science (UPV-Miagao), and Biology (UPV-Miagao). History UPV was created by merging four UP colleges: UP College of Fisheries founded in 1944; UP Cebu founded in 1918, UP Iloilo founded in 1947, and UP Tacloban founded in 1973. When the Miagao campus was established, many of the academic programs offered in the Iloilo City campus were moved there. To this day, the faculty, staff and students travel between the Iloilo City and Miagao campuses. During the term of UP President Onofre D. Corpuz in 1975 an interdisciplinary team within the university conceived of an autonomous unit which would become an institution for fisheries and marine science education and research. The idea was fleshed out in a proposal entitled \\"Education Development Plan for the University of the Philippines in the Visayas\\", a six-volume report by the interdisciplinary team. The new university would evolve from the UP College of Iloilo and the College of Fisheries in Diliman, which would transfer to its new site in the Visayas. Funding was to come partly from a government loan, to be negotiated with the World Bank for the development of fisheries education. On September 21, 1977, President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Presidential Decree 1200, known as the Philippine Five-Year Development Plan (1978–1982), which provides, among others, that Region VI would be the site of the University of the Philippines in the Visayas (UPV) with emphasis on fisheries and marine sciences. A second UPV Project Development Team was then organized in December 1977 to review and update the plans. The development plan was approved by the UP Board of Regents on May 28, 1978. The fisheries educational loan was then re-negotiated with the World Bank inasmuch as its appraisal team had earlier favorably endorsed the development plan. On May 31, 1979, the Board of Regents approved the establishment of the University of the Philippines in the Visayas as an autonomous unit of the University of the Philippines System with its main campus in Miagao, Iloilo. It would start with two colleges, the UP College Iloilo as its College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Fisheries as its flagship college. Through the Sixth Educational Loan of the Philippine Government approved by the World Bank in January 1980, the development of the UPV flagship college was made possible. On February 29, 1980, the groundbreaking of the UPV site in Miagao was held. On June 26, 1980, Executive Order No. 628 of President Ferdinand E. Marcos operationalized UPV, and Dr. Dionisia A. Rola was appointed the first Chancellor, becoming the first ever woman Chancellor in the history of UP. The development of the site and construction of facilities began in September 1981 and was made possible through the Sixth Educational Loan. The loan of about $18 million was used for site acquisition, construction of buildings, procurement of equipment, and the transfer of the College of Fisheries personnel and other property from Diliman to Miagao. Originally, UPV consisted of two colleges - the College of Fisheries and the College of Arts and Sciences, formerly UP College Iloilo. Now it has five colleges and a school in four campuses with the establishment of the College of Management in 1981 and the School of Technology in 1984, and the integration of UP Cebu College and UP Tacloban College into UPV in 1986. On April 30, 1987, the Board of Regents approved the reorganization of the College of Fisheries (now the College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences or CFOS) and the establishment of four institutes, namely, the Institute of Aquaculture, the Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanology, Institute of Fish Processing Technology, and the Institute of Fisheries Policy and Development Studies. The Brackishwater Aquaculture Center facilities in Leganes, Iloilo became the Brackishwater Aquaculture Research Station of IA. In May 1988, the College of Fisheries transferred to the new site in Miagao under the leadership of Chancellor Rogelio O. Juliano and Dean Efren Ed. C. Flores. The Diliman-based programs of the College of Fisheries were then relocated to its present site together with most of its faculty and staff. In January 1990, the School of Technology transferred to the Miagao Campus. In June of the same year, Chancellor Francisco Nemenzo effected the transfer of the Division of Humanities and the Division of Social Sciences of the College of Arts and Sciences. In May 1993, the transfer of the Division of Physical Sciences and Mathematics and the Division of Biological Sciences, along with the Office of the Dean, completed the transfer of the CAS. On September 24, 2010, the U.P. Board of Regents elevated the status of UP Cebu as an autonomous unit, in preparation for its constituent university status after five to seven years. Two degree-granting units remain on the Iloilo City Campus. They are the College of Management, and the CAS Division of Professional Education. Also on campus is the U.P. High School in Iloilo (formerly U.P.V. High School). The High School is an experimental laboratory for innovative teaching strategies designed to provide academic training for underprivileged students in order to better prepare them for access to tertiary education in the University of the Philippines. Some units have remained on the Iloilo City Campus: * the Center for West Visayan Studies (CWVS), * Office of Extension Services and Continuing Education (OESCE), * Sentro ng Wikang Filipino (SWF), * Graduate Program Office (GPO), * Language Program, * School for Distance Education, Visayas, * Ugnayan sa Pahinungod/Oblation Corps, * UPV Women's Desk. Part of the Miagao Campus has been reserved to accommodate government regional offices and the Miagao town government offices and centers with which UPV interfaces. At present, a Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) Branch is accommodated in the UPV Miagao Campus Library-Museum Building. Degree-granting units =UP Visayas - Miagao Campus= College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (formerly the College of Fisheries) The College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (CFOS) of the University of the Philippines Visayas gives fisheries education. The college has instituted degree programs that address the need for sustainable development of the country's fisheries resources and respond to the call for highly trained manpower in the field, at graduate and undergraduate level. The College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences has four institutes: the Institute of Aquaculture, the Institute of Fish Processing Technology, the Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanology, and the Institute of Fisheries Policy and Development Studies. It offers programs in Undergraduate -- B.S. Fisheries; Graduate -- Master of Aquaculture, M.S. Fisheries with majors in Aquaculture, Fisheries Biology, and Fish Processing Technology; and Ph.D. in Aquaculture. College of Arts and Sciences The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) provides the general education program that is the foundation of all academic programs in the university. The College equips the students with basic knowledge in the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. It offers interdisciplinary programs with double major supportive of, or complementary to, those offered by other colleges. The college has a Division of Professional Education and a laboratory high school designed to train underprivileged youth especially from rural areas. The College of Arts and Sciences has five divisions: the Biological Sciences, Humanities, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences and Mathematics, and Professional Education. The Professional Education Division offers the following programs: Master of Education in Biology, Chemistry, English as a Second Language, Guidance, Mathematics, Filipino as a Second Language, Reading, Social Studies, and Physics. An M.S. Biology is also offered by the Division of Biological Sciences. The academic programs of CAS are the following: Undergraduate (Baccalaureate) -- Bachelor of Arts in Communication and Media Studies, Community Development, Literature, History, Political Science, Psychology, Public Health, Sociology; Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Economics, Biology, and Chemistry; Undergraduate (Post-Baccalaureate) -- Diploma in Physical Education, Certificate and Diploma in Science Education, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics Education. School of Technology The School of Technology (SoTech), formerly the School of Technology and Environmental Resources (STER), was established on March 29, 1984 as the fifth degree-granting unit of UP in the Visayas during the 966th Meeting of the Board of Regents. It was formally operationalized on February 17, 1986 with the transfer of the Food Technology program, along with its faculty, from the College of Arts and Sciences. On April 22, 1993, the name of the school was changed from STER to SoTech. The school provide trained manpower, generates environment-friendly technologies, disseminate information and transfer knowledge and technology; and assist in the proper management of the environment. The School of Technology offers B.S. Food Technology, B.S. Chemical Engineering and the Certificate in Environmental Resource Management (CERM) with specialization in Coastal Resource Management, Watershed Management, and Environmental Technology. =UP Visayas - Iloilo City Campus= The Library of the UP Visayas Iloilo City campus is the former city hall of Iloilo City. The College of Management was formerly the School of Development Management, established in December 1981 out of the former Division of Development Management of the College of Arts and Sciences. SDM was elevated to college status in 1991. The objectives of the college are to support the UPV programs in fisheries, marine sciences, the arts, social and natural sciences; to provide management education in order to train leaders for the region's public and private sectors; to serve as center for research, information dissemination, consultancy, and training services in administration/management; and to serve as a link between UPV and local, national, and international organizations engaged in management education, training and research. The College of Management has two departments, namely, the Department of Accounting and the Department of Management. It offers the following academic programs: Undergraduate -- B.S. Accountancy, B.S. Business Administration (Marketing), and B.S. Management; Graduate -- Master of Management in Business Management, Public Management, Rural Development Management, and Tax Management. Starting June 1997, the college offered the Diploma Program in Urban and Regional Planning in coordination with the School of Urban and Regional Planning at UP Diliman. In July 1997, CM started the pilot testing of a course on Island Food Systems in RDM 298 (Field Studies), a course in the Master of Management, Rural Development Program. The initiative was made under the auspices of the Island Sustainability, Livelihood, and Equity (ISLE) Program. ISLE partners from Canada, Indonesia, and Jamaica team- taught the course with UPV faculty members. In 2014, CM offered extension classes for Master of Management in Roxas City, Capiz at the Pueblo de Panay which is located in the city. Also found in UPV Iloilo campus is the University of the Philippines High School in Iloilo. =University of the Philippines Visayas Tacloban College= In its 823rd meeting, the UP Board of Regents established the UP College Tacloban as an answer to the need for quality education in Region VIII. It was recognized as a regional unit of the System on May 23, 1973 and inaugurated on July 2, 1973. Ten years later, Executive Order No. 4 placed UP College Tacloban under the administrative supervision of UP in the Visayas. The mission of the College is to develop professionals and leaders by providing opportunities for a UP education to qualified secondary and tertiary education graduates. UPV Tacloban College is divided into four divisions: the Division of Humanities, the Division of Management, the Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and the Division of Social Sciences.

Foundation The nunnery was founded about 986 by Ælfthryth, the widow of King Edgar. She retired there to live a life of penance for her part in the murders of her first husband Æthelwald and of her step-son King Edward. She died at the monastery on 17 November 1002 and was buried there.Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey of Wherwell, in H.

The grant included exemption from temporal service, and the gift of land and houses at Edelingdene, Winchester and Bullington. An unnamed granddaughter of Ælfthryth (and daughter of King Æthelred the Unready) was abbess in the eleventh century.Frank Barlow, Edward the Confessor, Yale University Press, 1997, p. 28n According to the Annals of Winchester and Florence of Worcester, King Edward the Confessor's mother, Emma, and his wife Edith were both confined for a period at Wherwell, but it seems likely that this assertion is confused and that Emma was never sent to Wherwell.Edward A.

The annual revenue then amounted to £14. 10s.H. Arthur Doubleday & William Page (edd.), A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 1, London, 1903, p. 475. Later history During the Anarchy in 1141, the Empress Matilda's forces fortified the abbey, but they were defeated by King Stephen's troops. Matilda's men fled into the abbey, which was then burned by Stephen's troops commanded by William of Ypres. Traces of the earthworks built by the Empress Matilda's forces are visible today.h2g2, Hampshire Earthwork Castles In about 1186 a nun called Maud became Abbess, remaining in office for 40 years until her death. In 1226 she was succeeded in 1226 by Euphemia. Between then and her death on 26 April 1257, Euphemia seems to have been a veritable whirlwind. Events include many undated charters relating to small gifts or grants was made. Like Maud, she seems to have been well loved by the nuns, as the surviving cartulary records. Euphemia built a new farmery, dorter and areas for other functions, such as latrines with running water, all away from the main buildings, and nearby a chapel of the Blessed Virgin, with a large enclosed garden. By the river bank, she constructed other practical buildings, but left access to the river for the nuns. She cleared sordid older buildings that were a fire risk and built a new hall for the manor court, and further away a new and efficient mill She rebuilt from the ground up the dilapidated manor house at Middleton, and took similar measures at Tufton. She was attentive to charitable works and in providing hospitality. She embellished the Norman church that had replaced the original Saxon church after the Conquest with crosses, reliquaries, precious stones, vestments, and books. When the decaying bell tower collapsed on to the dorter in the early hours, narrowly missing the nuns, she built a tall and handsome replacement that matched the remaining buildings and in her old age she had dismantled and rebuilt with 12-foot deep foundations the sanctuary of the church. Abbess Euphemia also oversaw a significant expansion in the size of the community with the number of nuns being housed reaching 80. The Black Death later cut this number to single figures.Times Higher Education, 3 October 1997 In 1291 the temporalities of the Wherwell Abbey were valued at a very considerable £201 18s. 5½d., in addition to which the abbess received pensions of £1 10s. from the church of Wallop and £1 6s. 8d. from the church of Berton. That same year, on 12 August, Pope Nicholas IV granted a relaxation of one year and forty days to penitents practising imposed penance who visited the Abbey church of Wherwell, on the four feasts of the Blessed Virgin, and on that of the Holy Cross and its octave. In larger monastic houses of both men and women, the sacristan held a highly responsible post and at Wherwell was the beneficiary of specific income from dedicated rents. During the time of another abbess Maud (1333-1340) an inventory of the valuables in the sacristan’s custody was compiled. It detailed two precious chalices donated by Abbess Maud herself and Abbess Ellen de Percy and nine other chalices, several for use on a specific altar, two with depictions of St Thomas Becket on the foot, a number of silver and silver gilt ciboria and pyxes to hold the sacred hosts, one in the form of a tower. There were also crosses, basins, cruets for wine and water, candlesticks, censers, incense boats with their spoons, and two crowns (perhaps for crowning a statue of the Virgin), all in silver or silver gilts. This indicates not idle riches, but a certain level of income plus an attention to the dignity of the liturgical services as already seen a century earlier under Abbess Euphemia. Other burials *Benjamin Lethieullier *Cecily Shirley West, wife of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr Dissolution After having been in substance harassed for some years, the abbey was left with no option but to surrender at the Dissolution of the monasteries to the crown on 21 November 1539. The abbess received an annual pension of £40, the prioress one of £6, and twenty-three nuns received pensions of from £5 to £2 13s. 4d. Post-dissolution It was originally intended that the site and estates be granted to John Kingsmill, brother of the abbess, but in fact they were granted to Thomas West, 9th Baron De La Warr, after he successfully petitioned Cromwell for it. The manor house of Wherwell Priory was built on the site. Present day The abbey has disappeared, but in 1997 a geophysical survey by archaeologists from Southampton University located the foundations under the lawn of the eighteenth-century Wherwell Priory.

In January 1938 the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force (CNVF) was created with Commander W. G. Beauchamp as Commanding Officer. On 31 August 1939, the CNVF was mobilized for war duties. Three years later, the CNVF was offered to, and accepted by the Royal Navy (RN) as a Volunteer Reserve, the \\"Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve\\", or CRNVR. It continued under RN operational and administrative command until March 1946. With the end of the war, it reverted to Ceylon Government Control, though yet CRNVR in name. In the 1939–1946 period, the CRNVR carried out several operational duties, mainly at sea. Cutting its teeth on the Port Commission tugs Samson and Goliath, it later manned and operated trawlers and Antarctic whalers converted as minesweepers and fitted out with guns, submarine detection equipment and anti- submarine weaponry. They were HMS Overdale Wyke (the first ship to be purchased by the Government of Ceylon), HMS Okapi, HMS Semla, HMS Sambhur, HMS Hoxa, HMS Balta and HM Tugs Barnet and C 405. In addition the CRNVR manned several motor fishing vessels (MFV), harbour defence motor launch (HDML) and miscellaneous auxiliary vessels. All were manned exclusively by CRNVR personnel. These ships were meant to sweep and guard the approaches the harbors but were often used on extended missions outside Ceylon waters. In the course of these operations, the ships came under enemy fire, recovered essential information from Japanese aircraft that were shot down, sailed to Akyab after the Burma front was opened in two FMVs for harbour duties and, was called upon to accept the surrender of the Italian light cruiser Eritrea and escort her to port with a prize crew on board. =Royal Ceylon Navy= After independence from British rule in 1948, the government believed an island nation should possess a strong navy to be it first line of defense. Therefore, on 9 December 1950 the Royal Ceylon Navy was created, with Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve forming the nucleus. The first warship was commissioned , an Algerine-class minesweeper, ex-HMS Flying Fish along with other patrol boats and tugs. Later the fleet was expanded with HMCyS Parakram, another Algerine- class minesweeper (ex-HMS Pickle), two Canadian-built River-class frigates HMCyS Mahasena (ex-HMS Violetta, HMCS Orkney and ex-Israeli ship Mivtach), HMCyS Gajabahu (ex-HMCS Hallowell, ex-Israeli Misnak) and oceangoing tug (ex- HMS Adept). During the 1971 insurrection the navy sent its sailors for combat operations against the insurgents. In 1972 the \\"Dominion of Ceylon\\" became the \\"Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\\", and the Royal Ceylon Navy became the Sri Lanka Navy. The naval ensign along with the flag officers' flags were redesigned. =Recent years= At the beginning of the civil war in the 1980s the navy found itself poorly equipped to face the new threats the LTTE created. But this was soon overcome by increasing the fleet of patrol boats and the introduction of fast attack crafts. These proved highly successful in limiting the LTTE's use of the seas. The weapon systems on these were upgraded with time as the sea tigers resorted to using sophisticated suicide crafts against naval vessels. Sri Lankan Navy troop transport ship During this time the navy took part in its first amphibious operation in its history. The size of the force along with the fleet increased in the years of war. In the early 1980s a land combat force was created which at first limited itself to base defense and as its numbers increased took part in offensive operations against rebel forces along with the Sri Lankan Army. An elite naval special forces unit called the Special Boat Squadron was created in the late 80's based on the British Special Boat Service. In 2000 the Navy started a fleet air arm (FAA) by acquiring a HAL Chetak from India. Today the FAA operates from the two offshore patrol vessels of the fleet. At present conventional warfare capability is increased by the addition of missile corvettes.

The population in 2001 was 457 increasing to 475 at the 2011 Census. It is located about five kilometres (three miles) outside the town of Stratford-upon-Avon on the banks of the river Avon and has views south over the Cotswolds. Facilities and communications include a phone box, a 19th-century church,Stratford-on-Avon District Council a post box, a marina with a 17th-century lock, a village green and a recently refurbished village hall originally built in 1953. The parish encompasses Dodwell () Caravan Park to the north of the village. The village is reputed to be the meeting place of Anne Hathaway and William Shakespeare, as Anne was from the parish, and local lore states that they probably conducted their courtship in the area.  Economy  The village is largely a dormitory village, with the majority of the inhabitants working elsewhere. Residence and community is the main activity within the village, with surrounding farms providing some employment opportunity. Regular transient workers living on the farm are encouraged to be involved in the village and this year (2015) there was even an \\"international tug-o-war competition, with finalists Lithuania vs Bulgaris showing that Luddington is a truly welcome place to be. Following the first suspected H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the UK, when a dead swan was found in Scotland, samples were sent to Luddington's now closed veterinary research facility for testing. Bomfords has frequently been at loggerheads with the village residents, who successfully took the company to court to prevent its very large goods vehicles driving through the village, resulting in a 7.5t limit on traffic and a massive reduction in the flow of vehicles. The Dodwell Trading Estate to the north of Luddington on the main Stratford-Evesham road, offers another source of employment and retail including bespoke joinery, antiques and unique homewares. Within the village, there is also a farrier and an organ building and repair business, a finance company and a healthcare/medical devices producer.  History  The name Luddington is of Anglo-Saxon origin meaning Luda's farmstead. Dodwell is also of Anglo-Saxon origin and means Dodda's well or spring. The village was originally accessed via a road running from the Evesham road down through Dodwell. This then continued through a ford in the river to Milcote. This first part of this road is now a footpath and the second part no longer exists. The village was part of the Ragley estate belonging to the Marquis of Hertford. One of the oldest building in the village is part of Boddington Farm, which dates from the 17th century. It marks the eastern boundary of the village's conservation area. During the English civil war, Robert Simcock's (Simcox) barn was emptied of its \\"carefully stored\\" apples by marauding troops.Luddington Parish Plan Other old buildings include Clover Cottage, which is now part of a row of three cottages thought to formerly be one single-floor thatched cottage that has been split by a builder in the 20th century. Evidence of Clover Cottage dating back to before the 16th century was found during a recent (2015) renovation of the thatch in which the whole thatch was removed and replaced. Other important buildings include Sandfields Farm (now Luddington Grange), The Manor and The Cottage (now named The Old House). The Cottage's front garden is shown on some maps to have been the original site of the church, where it is rumoured that the playwright and poet William Shakespeare may have married Anne Hathaway.Stratford-on-Avon District Council The current church is not the church that stood in the village in Shakespeare's time, but is a 19th-century replacement and is on a different site. There are numerous half-timbered buildings. The former Methodist Chapel was opened in August 1932, in a farm building owned by Thomas Higginson, a local farmer and Methodist Local Preacher.Account of Luddington Methodist Chapel on Rewlach Methodist History Other more recent buildings have been allocated to the farm estates. The village green was given over to public (Common) land by the Marquis of Hertford of Ragley Hall at Arrow. Until at least 1990 Luddington was home to Luddington Experimental Horticulture Station (EHS), one of several such establishments around the country undertaking field research for the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF).  Village life  May Day, Luddington Village Green, 1933. The blacksmith's shop is in the background. The village has many events including Carols on the Green on Christmas Eve with a brass band and mulled wine. There is an annual village fête in the summer and regular social events including All Saints Arms pub nights, quiz nights, the Arts Club, annual Flower Show, Luddflicks (cinema evenings) and dance classes in the village hall. Other activities include fishing, boating and canoeing though there is no slipway. The route of the Stratford Marathon passes through the village and the villagers host a water station and toilet facilities at their homes and the hall. Dodwell Farm, about north of the village hosts occasional motocross events during the summer.  Dodwell  The civil parish also includes the Dodwell caravan park about north of the village proper. The construction of this park effectively doubled the parish's population and means that the parish has two separate centres of population.Luddington Parish Plan Dodwell was originally a farming hamlet on the Evesham Road from Stratford to Bidford west of Bordon Hill.  Youth  The young people of the parish all reside in the village proper with no children living in Dodwell. Those of school age tend to attend schools within Stratford-on-Avon district, usually either in Stratford-upon-Avon or Alcester. There are few facilities for young people, apart from the swings on the green. There are no schools in the parish.  Transport  There are limited bus services for both the village and Dodwell, but not between the two, though the walk between the two is 10 minutes and the bus can take you to within a 5-minute walk.Warwickshire transport site  References   External links  * [www.luddington.org] * Luddington Parish Plan contains detailed information about life in the parish, facilities and future improvements. * Rewlach Methodist History article on the origins of Luddington Methodist Chapel Category:Villages in Warwickshire ","title":"Luddington, Warwickshire"},{"id":"10747797","text":"Thomas Ian McAdam (born 9 April 1954) is a Scottish former footballer who played for a number of British clubs, spending around half of his career with Celtic.

The primary motivation for employing lazy learning, as in the K-nearest neighbors algorithm, used by online recommendation systems (\\"people who viewed/purchased/listened to this movie/item/tune also ...\\") is that the data set is continuously updated with new entries (e.g., new items for sale at Amazon, new movies to view at Netflix, new clips at YouTube, new music at Spotify or Pandora). Because of the continuous update, the \\"training data\\" would be rendered obsolete in a relatively short time especially in areas like books and movies, where new best-sellers or hit movies/music are published/released continuously. Therefore, one cannot really talk of a \\"training phase\\". Lazy classifiers are most useful for large, continuously changing datasets with few attributes that are commonly queried. Specifically, even if a large set of attributes exist - for example, books have a year of publication, author/s, publisher, title, edition, ISBN, selling price, etc. - recommendation queries rely on far fewer attributes - e.g., purchase or viewing co-occurrence data, and user ratings of items purchased/viewed. Advantages The main advantage gained in employing a lazy learning method is that the target function will be approximated locally, such as in the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Because the target function is approximated locally for each query to the system, lazy learning systems can simultaneously solve multiple problems and deal successfully with changes in the problem domain. At the same time they can reuse a lot of theoretical and applied results from linear regression modelling (notably PRESS statistic) and control . It is said that the advantage of this system is achieved if the predictions using a single training set are only developed for few objects. This can be demonstrated in the case of the k-NN technique, which is instance-based and function is only estimated locally. Disadvantages Theoretical disadvantages with lazy learning include: * The large space requirement to store the entire training dataset. In practice, this is not an issue because of advances in hardware and the relatively small number of attributes (e.g., as co-occurrence frequency) that need to be stored. * Particularly noisy training data increases the case base unnecessarily, because no abstraction is made during the training phase. In practice, as stated earlier, lazy learning is applied to situations where any learning performed in advance soon becomes obsolete because of changes in the data. Also, for the problems for which lazy learning is optimal, \\"noisy\\" data does not really occur - the purchaser of a book has either bought another book or hasn't. * Lazy learning methods are usually slower to evaluate. In practice, for very large databases with high concurrency loads, the queries are not postponed until actual query time, but recomputed in advance on a periodic basis - e.g., nightly, in anticipation of future queries, and the answers stored. This way, the next time new queries are asked about existing entries in the database, the answers are merely looked up rapidly instead of having to be computed on the fly, which would almost certainly bring a high-concurrency multi-user system to its knees. *Larger training data also entail increased cost. Particularly, there is the fixed amount of computational cost, where a processor can only process a limited amount of training data points. There are standard techniques to improve re-computation efficiency so that a particular answer is not recomputed unless the data that impact this answer has changed (e.g., new items, new purchases, new views). In other words, the stored answers are updated incrementally. This approach, used by large e-commerce or media sites, has long been used in the Entrez portal of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to precompute similarities between the different items in its large datasets: biological sequences, 3-D protein structures, published-article abstracts, etc. Because \\"find similar\\" queries are asked so frequently, the NCBI uses highly parallel hardware to perform nightly recomputation. The recomputation is performed only for new entries in the datasets against each other and against existing entries: the similarity between two existing entries need not be recomputed. Examples of Lazy Learning Methods * K-nearest neighbors, which is a special case of instance- based learning. * Local regression. * Lazy naive Bayes rules, which are extensively used in commercial spam detection software. Here, the spammers keep getting smarter and revising their spamming strategies, and therefore the learning rules must also be continually updated.

History Traditionally the Rule of Saint Benedict was interpreted that each monastery should be independent of other houses; this made it problematic to achieve reform if discipline had slipped or to resist the pressure to become a part of the Feudal structure, with the office of Abbot becoming an office at the disposal of the local lord. The Cluniac reform, the first major attempt to offer an institutional response to these issues, was to subvert this by making all of the monks of the houses that were part of Cluny members of the Cluny Abbey, with the subordinate houses being Priories of the Abbey. Subsequent orders – such as the Carthusians – were wholly integrated as an order, and modern Benedictines are organised in families which offer mutual accountability, e.g. the English Benedictine Congregation and the Subiaco Cassinese Congregation. Those houses that were larger than cells were known as priories, symbolising their subordination to the Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy. The prior of St Pancras at Lewes usually held the position of vicar-general of the Abbot of Cluny for England and Scotland. Since the head of their order was the Abbot at Cluny, all members of the order in Britain were bound to cross to France to visit Cluny to consult or be consulted, unless the Abbot chose to come to Britain. This he did five times in the 13th century, and only twice in the 14th. In 1056, the first Cluniac nunnery was founded at Marcigny and after this other convents followed including those in the British Isles. The Cluniac nuns were always greatly outnumbered by their male counterparts.

The main advantage gained in employing an eager learning method, such as an artificial neural network, is that the target function will be approximated globally during training, thus requiring much less space than using a lazy learning system. Eager learning systems also deal much better with noise in the training data. Eager learning is an example of offline learning, in which post-training queries to the system have no effect on the system itself, and thus the same query to the system will always produce the same result. The main disadvantage with eager learning is that it is generally unable to provide good local approximations in the target function.

The Sri Lanka Volunteer Naval Force (SLVNF) is the volunteer and volunteer reserve force of the Sri Lanka Navy, established in 1937 as the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force . It is headquartered at SLNS Lanka, Welisara, and is tasked with a support and complementary role to the country's navy, partly by serving as a pool of civilian talent and expertise otherwise lacking in (and not regularly required by) the regular naval force, and partly by acting as a reserve force during times of war. History The Sri Lanka Volunteer Naval Force can trace its roots to the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force (CNVF) of British Ceylon, and indeed predates its parent force, the Sri Lanka Navy, by several decades. The CNVF was raised in 1937 by the Volunteer Naval Defense Force Act, No. 1, under the command of Commander (later Captain) W. G. Beauchamp, with a complement of 12 officers and 18 sailors. The first headquarters of the force was set up on 11 January 1939 (formally opened on 14 June 1939), two days before the outbreak of World War II, at Kochchikade. The CNVF was immediately deployed at the Colombo- and Trincomalee Harbours; on 1 October 1943, the CNVF was placed under the command of the Royal Navy deployment on the island and renamed the Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (CRNVR). Command of the CRNVR was returned to the Government of Ceylon with the end of the War in 1946. With Ceylonese independence on the horizon, the Government of Ceylon selected a core cadre of 100 servicemen and officers from the CRNVR to form a more regular arm of its military, in the late 1940s. The Navy Act, No. 34 of 1950 established the CRNVR as the Royal Ceylon Volunteer Naval Force (RCVNF) on 9 January 1951, alongside the Royal Ceylon Navy to which the 100 servicemen were transferred. Officers and seamen of the CRNVR not on active service on this date formed the core of the RCVNF, with a strength of 12 officers and 121 men. To keep the port H.M.Cy.S. TISSA safe, Port Commission Officers were commissioned as a separate division of the VNF, with Captain M. Chandrasoma as Commanding Officer; this Division was disbanded in 1956. The Sri Lankan Constitution of 1972 saw the nation become a republic; the Dominion of Ceylon became the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. As with the other branches of the Ceylonese armed forces, the Royal Ceylon Volunteer Naval Force too underwent a rechristening, becoming the Sri Lanka Volunteer Naval Force (SLVNF). Since then, the SLVNF has been a key support mechanism to the Sri Lanka Navy during its operations in the Eelam Wars. Recruitment Citizens with a professional civilian career, in the state- or private sector are eligible to volunteer as officers of the SLVNF, provided they meet educational and professional qualification requirements. Ordinary ratings are recruited to either the reserves or to the active Seamen branch, with leave from active duty being granted in 5-year blocks. Tradesmen in particular are encouraged to volunteer through the SLVNF's Volunteer Special Scheme, which seeks to act as a pool of civil- and tradesman talent/experience. All members of the SLVNF are entitled to pensions and other remunerations on the same scale as the regular force. Awards and decorations *Prashansaniya Seva Vibhushanaya - 1972.

These systems are also typically examples of eager learning. While in online learning, only the set of possible elements is known, in offline learning, the identity of the elements as well as the order in which they are presented is known to the learner. Applications for robotics control The ability of robots to learn is equal to create a table (information) which is filled with values. One option for doing so is programming by demonstration. Here, the table is filled with values by a human teacher. The demonstration is provided either as direct numerical control policy which is equal to a trajectory, or as an indirect objective function which is given in advance. Offline learning is working in batch mode. In step 1 the task is demonstrated and stored in the table, and in step 2 the task is reproduced by the robot. The pipeline is slow and inefficient because a time lag is there between behavior demonstration and skill replay. A short example will help to understand the idea. Suppose the robot should learn a wall following task and the internal table of the robot is empty. Before the robot gets activated in the replay mode, the human demonstrator has to teach the behavior. He is controlling the robot with teleoperation and during the learning step the skill table is generated. The process is called offline, because the robot control software is doing nothing but the device is utilized by the human operator as a pointing device for driving along the wall.

Early life MacCarthy was born in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland, the daughter of Dr. Charles William MacCarthy and his wife Marion. Her early years were spent in Sydney, Australia, where the family emigrated in 1885. However, by 1891 she had returned to Britain to study the violin at the Royal College of Music, London, as a pupil of Enrique Fernández Arbós. As a child she performed in standard concertos at the Crystal Palace and Queen's Hall. She also toured with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and visited South Africa and Australia. In 1905 she was forced to give up her ambitions as a concert soloist by the onset of neuritis and went to India as a companion of Annie Besant, where she studied Indian music, collecting manuscripts and instruments, learned Indian singing and also studied Indian mysticism. She returned to England in 1909 following the death of her younger brother. In 1911 she married William Mann, a fellow theosophist, thus changing her name to Maud Mann. The couple had a daughter, Joan, in 1912. The marriage was short- lived, as Maud soon met and fell in love with the composer John Foulds in 1915. Despite strong opposition from family and friends, Maud and John Foulds left their respective spouses and lived together from 1918 onwards. They had two children, John Patrick (1916–2009) and Marybride (1922–1988). They finally married in 1932. She compiled the text for his World Requiem which was performed at the Albert Hall on four consecutive Armistice Nights between 1923 and 1926. Spiritual teaching In 1929, while living in the East End of London, they met a young man at a local social event whom they commonly referred to as 'The Boy'. A quiet yet powerful figure who worked at the local gas works, his real name was William (Bill) Coote. 'The Boy' almost instantaneously began to channel a group of beings known as 'The Brothers' who gave profound spiritual teachings through him for the next 26 years. Maud returned to India with John Foulds and William Coote in 1935 where 'The Brothers' continued their teachings through 'The Boy', making a profound impact on thousands of people in search of spiritual meaning. John Foulds died suddenly in 1939, and Maud married 'The Boy' in 1942. She founded an ashram and published poetry under the name Tandra Devi. She took the name Swami Omananda Puri after her husband's death when she took sannyas (or renunciation of worldly life). It was under this name that she published her autobiography of her experiences with 'The Boy' in The Boy and the Brothers (London: Gollancz, 1959). A second book was posthumously published as Towards the Mysteries (London: Neville Spearman, 1968) which further expanded on The Brothers' teachings and message. Her papers are now held at the Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York. Death She died in Douglas on the Isle of Man, aged 84, and was buried at Glastonbury.

Chillingworth was a product of the Cambridge United youth system, and after making his first team debut against Barnet in a Football League Trophy game in January 2000, he made his league debut on 1 April 2000 in a 1–0 defeat at Oldham Athletic in Division Two. A successful loan spell with neighbours Cambridge City followed in 2001 and he also enjoyed a temporary spell with Darlington where he scored once in four appearances under former United manager Tommy Taylor. His solitary league goal for The Quakers came in a 7–1 defeat at Scunthorpe United although he did also score in an FA Cup tie for Darlington at Altrincham. Chillingworth broke into the Cambridge team on a more permanent basis during 2001–02 and scored twice before niggling injuries began to affect his form. He failed to score at all during the following season although he did manage to score a number of goals over the next two seasons to reach a career total of 13 goals for the club in 87 appearances. Sandwiched in between was a loan spell with Leyton Orient where he scored twice in eight games. Following Cambridge United's relegation from the Football League in 2005, Chillingworth accepted a 2-year contract with Rushden & Diamonds. At the end of his first season Rushden were also relegated from the Football League into the Nationwide Conferencec. At the time of the club's relegation, due to injury and loss of form, Chillingworth had joined Notts County on loan although hopes of a permanent deal were dashed when the Diamonds new manager wanted him back for the club's inaugural season in the Conference. A change of manager at Rushden left Chillingworth out of favour and he jumped at the chance of a return to Cambridge United on a free transfer in January 2007. Towards the end of the season he forged a useful partnership with Robbie Simpson, to help the club avoid relegation from the Conference. He also scored his first hat-trick for the club, in the 7–0 win over Weymouth in March 2007. In the Summer of 2007, he signed a new contract with the U's - but only after boss Jimmy Quinn had withdrawn his original offer because he thought Chillingworth was taking too long to sign. He is currently out with an ankle injury, and has yet to feature for United in the 2007–08 season.

Ragi Mudde, Ragi Sangati or kali and colloquially simply referred to as either 'Mudde' (which means 'lump') or 'Hittu' - i.e. flour); is a wholesome meal in the state of Karnataka and the Rayalaseema region in Andhra Pradesh. It is mainly popular with the rural folk of Karnataka. In Tamil Nadu, especially in Western Tamil Nadu it is called Ragi Kali. Ragi mudde main food in Mandya , Hassan Mysore Tumkur districts in Karnataka.The Similar variation known as Dhindo is also eaten in Northeast India, Nepal and Bhutan. Preparation Ragi mudde, a store house of multi nutrients, has only two ingredients, the Ragi (finger millet) flour and water. A tablespoon of Ragi flour is first mixed with water to make a very thin paste and later added to a thick bottomed vessel containing water on a stove top. As this mixture boils and reaches the brim of the vessel, ragi flour is added which forms a mound on top of boiling water. The flour is allowed to cook in this fashion on medium high flame. Later with the help of a wooden stick (: mudde kolu / : hiTTin doNNe), the flour is beaten to a smooth dough like consistency with no lumps. This hot dough is then rested on low heat before rounding them on a wooden board into tennis ball sized balls with wet hands. Thus prepared Ragi balls are broken down into smaller balls using fingers and swallowed hot dipping them in 'saaru' / 'hesru' , chutney or gojju. It is not supposed to be chewed. Mudde, by itself, does not have a strong taste. Ragi Mudde is traditionally eaten with saaru (made of greens with sprouted grams, meat or vegetables), but can also be eaten with yogurt or butter milk. The saaru is often flavoured by mixing a dash of spicy, freshly ground green-chilli paste ( \\"Khaara\\"), in one's plate - according to taste. \\"Ragi Mudde-Bassaru\\" is a popular combination among the farming communities in Karnataka. Bassaru is made from the decanted water, which remains after (an assortment of) pulses are steamed (usually along with a couple of pods of garlic). This water takes up the earthy flavour of the pulses to nicely complement the earthy flavour of the 'Mudde' itself. Browned onions, red chillies, and some garlic are browned, and then ground into a paste along with grated coconut. This is added to the water, and the mixture is finally seasoned with oggarane. The steamed pulses themselves are often used to prepare a dry side salad known as 'palya' (). There are numerous variations of 'Bassaru', which each yield a differently named (usually, eponymous with the major ingredient) saaru. Bassaru is itself the portmanteau of 'Bas(tira)' () (steamed) and 'saaru'. 'Uppesru' ()/ 'Uppsaaru' () is another common accompaniment to 'mudde'. This is often simply a stew comprising steamed horsegram, as well as the water used to steam it; with added salt. Sometimes, hyacinth-beans ( 'AvarekaaLu') replace the horsegram. The horsegram version is also known as 'HurLi saaru' (). Ragi mudde is rich in the same nutrients that are found in Finger millet - namely fibre, Calcium, and Iron. Eaten with Ragi mudde is consumed with the famous Karnataka style Upsaaru, Bassaaru or Chicken curry or Menthyada Gojju (sweet sour dish made of Fenugreek and Tamarind). It is the most famous and almost a daily food for most of the south Karnataka/old Mysore populace. Many luxury hotels serve Ragi Mudde on special occasions.

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and served in the House of Representatives from 1977 to 1996, representing the Division of Griffith in Queensland. He was Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the Hawke and Keating Governments from 1987 to 1993. Early life Humphreys was born in Brisbane and worked as a mechanic before entering politics. Politics Humphreys was elected to federal parliament at the 1977 federal election. Humphreys served a six-year term as Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the ministries of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. In May 1992, that ministry and Humphreys along with it was promoted to Cabinet, and Humphreys also took over the duties of Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia from Senator Bob Collins. Humphreys' elevation to Cabinet was because he was a Queenslander and there was a push to get at least one other Queenslander to Cabinet as Queensland in Cabinet prior to the May 1992 reshuffle was underrepresented. Despite this promotion to Cabinet, Humphreys was not reselected for a place in the ministry by the ALP caucus after the ALP's 1993 election victory ten months later. After 18 years in parliament, Humphreys intended to leave politics in 1994, but delayed his retirement when the man he considered his ideal successor was ready to stand for preselection for Griffith – Kevin Rudd in 1995, later to become leader of the ALP and Prime Minister of Australia, lost the 1996 election to Liberal candidate Graeme McDougall but later won the seat in 1998.Gordon, Michael: \\"One determined bastard\\", The Age, 19 April 2003. Humphreys would perhaps have retired from Parliament in 1995 after Kevin Rudd's preselection in Griffith but decided against it as that would have meant an unwanted by-election not long after the ALP's loss of the seat of Canberra in a by-election earlier that year.

The Driggs family came to Arizona in 1921 after trading everything they owned--a bank, drugstore, hotel, and wheat farm in Driggs, Idaho--for a section of cotton land in Maricopa County. Their timing was unfortunate as cotton prices plummeted just as their crop came in and they were forced to take jobs selling building and loan certificates. In 1929, the Driggs family pooled $5,000 to found the Western Building and Loan Association, which became Western Savings. Success and eventual failure Western Savings and Loan eventually became a $6 billion savings and loan institution. Western shared a position on the list of the nation's 100 largest savings and loans with other Arizona-based institutions — MeraBank was number 27 on the list, Western came in at 37th, Great American was 67th, and Pima was 82nd. But in 1989, Western Savings moved into second place — not for its size, but for the amount of its losses, with a $1.06 billion net deficit, following a substantial but smaller loss the previous year. Western Savings was taken over by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal depositor for the savings and loan crisis bailout in June 1989. In June 1990, Bank of America paid the Resolution Trust Corporation $81 million for Western Savings' $3.5 billion in deposits in 60 branches in Arizona and one branch in Salt Lake City, Utah, and converted the thrift into commercial bank called Bank of America Arizona. In 1995, President Gary Driggs pleaded guilty to two felony charges and was fined $10,000 and placed on probation for five years. Accomplishments and recognition American Newcomen honored Western Savings and Loan Association in the year of the company's 40th anniversary. Since it was formed by the Driggs family in the Spring of 1929, six months before the historic stock crash, Western Savings had at that time grown to become the largest savings and loan association in Arizona and among the 100 largest in the United States. The major objectives of the association were the encouragement of thrift and the promotion of home ownership. Over the years up to that point, more than 30,000 first mortgage loans had been made, totaling more than 390 million dollars, thus providing an important factor in the growth and development of Arizona.

John Wesley Wolfe settled in the location in 1898 with his oldest son Fred.Wolfe Ranch - National Park Service A nagging leg injury from the Civil War prompted Wolf to move west from Ohio, looking for a drier climate. He chose this tract of more than along Salt Wash for its water and grassland - enough for a few cattle. The Wolfes built a one-room cabin, a corral, and a small dam across Salt Wash. For more than a decade they lived alone on the remote ranch. In 1906, Wolf's daughter Flora Stanley, her husband, and their children moved to the ranch. Shocked at the primitive conditions, Stanley convinced her father to build a new cabin with a wood floor. The ranch on Salt Wash was established about that time under the Bar DX brand. With the arrival of Wolfe's daughter and son-in-law in 1906, the newer, surviving structures were built. However, the Stanley family moved to Moab in 1908. The family sold the ranch to Tommy Larson in 1910 and returned to Ohio. John Wolfe died on October 22, 1913, in Etna, Ohio at the age of eighty-four. Larson eventually sold the ranch to Marvin Turnbow and his partners, Lester Walker and Stib Beeson.

Such worms usually (but not necessarily) send spoofed \\"From\\" headers.  Types of software  Most bulk email software programs are hosted by third party companies who sell access to their system. Customers pay per send or at a fixed monthly rate to have their own user account from which they can manage their contacts and send out email campaigns. Generally the advantage of this type of program is the reliability of the third party vendor and their application. Some bulk email software programs are self-hosted. The customer buys a license or develops their own program and then hosts the program.

Education encompasses the scope of social values, morality, tradition, religion, politics and history. It is the acquired body of knowledge that equips the emerging labor force with the necessary skills to ensure its active participation in economic development. The acquisition of literacy, arithmetic, and problem-solving skills improves the value and efficiency of labor. It creates a skilled and intellectually flexible labor force through training, expertise, and academic credentials. A professional working force enhances the quality of a nation's economic productivity and guarantees its suitability for global market competitiveness. According to a recent research report by the United Nations Population Fund, countries such as Egypt, Jordan, and Algeria have invested in family planning, healthcare, and education and have subsequently experienced more rapid economic development than the countries that were reluctant to invest in social development programs. The status of education in the Middle East =Background of The Middle East= The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region comprises the countries of Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), West Bank and Gaza, Israel and Yemen. Despite that Israel is geographically situated in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, this article focuses on the countries that are bounded by Arabic language majority, except Iran where Persian is the official language and Turkey where Turkish is the official language. Although most MENA countries share common identity formation features - Islam as the main religion and Arabic as a common language (except Iran and Turkey), they differ in ethnicity, tradition, history and spoken dialects of Arabic. Economic development strategies also vary between the oil-producing states such as Kuwait and United Arab Emirates and the non-oil producing countries such as Tunisia and Jordan. During the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries, most countries of the region were under European colonization. Though the colonizing authorities were the first to introduce a compulsory education, access to modern (European-style) education was restricted to a select elite. Colonial education in many ways was designed to shape local intellectual development and to limit their ability of local actors in challenging the colonizers’ political control, while enhancing the of Western culture, but it resulted from the colonizer's willingness to advance a dominant and superior western culture while annexing further territories in the MENA region and imposing restrictions on nationals. Colonies such as Tunisia and Egypt invested in educational missions that sent elite students to Europe where they could study technologies and modes of life and ultimately transfer their acquired knowledge to their countries of origin. Such measures resulted in the creation of modern schools in the nineteenth century such as the polytechnic school of Bardo (est. 1830) and represented the French Ecole Polytechnique in Tunisia. By the late nineteenth century, there was widespread awareness of Western culture's impact. The new Ottoman ruling élite, referred to as intelligentsia, was trained in specialized schools under the tutelage of European specialists. Governments seeking reforms trained the intelligentsia élite as officials, doctors, engineers and police officers. In Cairo, lawyers were trained at a French law school in order to be able to work in mixed courts. In Tunisia, the French colonizers controlled both primary and secondary schools such as the Sadiqiyya, a secondary school established as a model of a French highschool, the lycée. =Post-colonial period= 1-Historical perspective: In the Middle East and North Africa, during the post-colonial era, education spread as result of the significant social changes and the rise of indigenous élite as a ruling power. The willingness of national governments to build a strong nation made the acquisition of literacy a necessary skill for maximizing human potential. Most scholars and policy makers in the region have argued that education is the cornerstone of society's economic growth and expansion. They stress the importance of investing in education in order to promote sustained economic development, although despite significant expansion of educational reach and services, unemployment remains highWorld Bank, Claiming the Future: Choosing Prosperity in the Middle East and North Africa, (Washington, DC: The World Bank, October 1995).The Brookings Institution, Middle East Youth Initiative, \\"Inclusion: Meeting the 100 Million Youth Challenge, 2007\\". In the post-colonial period, the dominant pattern has been governments’ control of education. Free education was promoted by many leaders, including Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, as a critical aspect of nation-building, and promised that each graduate would find a position in the public sector. The expansion of primary, secondary and tertiary education has paralleled the rapid population growth since the 1960s. Between 1965 and 1990, the percentage of students enrolled in primary education increased from 61% to 98%. Despite the introduction of higher education colonialism, the pace of enrollment at the university level increased significantly immediately following independence. In 1939, there were no more than nine regional universities, and by 1960, twenty. States with the highest numbers of enrolled students included Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. In the conservative regimes of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, European-style education was slow to emerge. Regimes were careful to expose the students to doctrines that might contradict with the Islamic culture, although Kuwait served as an exception. The Persian Gulf states have since introduced far-reaching educational reforms, with the awareness that only by investing in their own human capital will they see economic development continue beyond the oil boom years. Recently, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has been featured in the international press for his efforts to establish multiple centers of learning, with a mixed-gender Western model.Saudi King Tries to Grow Modern Ideas in Desert, The New York Times, 2007-10-26 Post-independence Challenges: Problems in expanding access to education were common to all MENA countries in the post-independence years. Affordable education did not necessarily reduce the number of uneducated children as a result of the population boom. Similarly, the educational system proved to be inadequate as classrooms, led by overworked and often underqualified teachers, were crowded with children. Students who moved through the strictly exam-based system were, and often continue to be, ill- equipped with skills necessary for university-level education and employment. Other problems emerged as the state attempted to unify multiple systems under the state: European-style and Islamic, public and private, instruction in Arabic and others in a foreign language, usually French or English. As a result, while some Islamic schools were closed, others became part of larger universities. As an example, the Zaytuna, a traditional Islamic school in Tunis, was incorporated to the school of Shari'a of the University of Tunis. Another pattern seen under post-colonial government control of education was the Arabization of educational institutions. Schools that during colonial rule taught through the medium of a foreign language, began to teach in Arabic. As a consequence, students' opportunities to master a foreign language decreased in countries such as Syria where introduction to a European second language occurred only in the secondary schools, not during primary education. Students who wanted to pursue their studies abroad had to rely on family wealth or government scholarships. Those who were not able to master a foreign language faced serious obstacles. However, as the best-quality education could only be obtained in private schools, a wealthy educated élite remained. The intelligentsia class continued to master foreign languages and to enjoy employment advantages. By contrast, the larger part of society had to rely on the government's educational facilities and dwindling opportunities in public sector positions. Women in Post-colonial Societies: The spread of education in the region has engendered many social changes that influenced the position of women in MENA countries. Most importantly, even in the conservative regimes, women had access to education. Throughout the region, while the percentage of girls in primary schools was as important as that of boys, female access to higher education was steadily rising. Correspondingly, due to their improved level of literacy, educated women could work as lawyers, doctors, and employees in social services. In countries such as Tunisia and Iraq where the state governments were willing to rapidly modernize their societies, women Conflict and Education in the Middle East A report by Strategic Foresight Group has mentioned the academic cost of conflict in the Middle East. After the 2003 US war in Iraq, there has been a deliberate targeting of educational establishments by militants. In 2007, 353 academics were assassinated. Almost 800,000 children are currently out of school, and over 3,000 academics have fled the country. Over 30% of children and 40% of university students stay at home due to fear, and paucity of schools near them. In the Lebanon 2006 war, Lebanese children were some of the worst affected, where 33% of all civilian deaths were children and 390,000 children were displaced. 40,000 children had their education disrupted during the war, with over 300 schools having been damaged. More than 1,300 Palestinians schools have been disrupted by curfews, and closures. Literacy rates As a result of government investment in education, the average of educational attainment of the labor force increased. Though mostly regarded as a symbol of national achievement rather than a financial goal, high literacy rates had more than doubled in the countries of the Middle East and North Africa in the period spanning from 1960 to 1995. Despite the improvement of literacy levels in the region, there was a discrepancy between the countries with a significant urban population in which literacy rates had marked a steady increase and the predominantly rural countries where the percentage of illiteracy was remarkably high. Due to the rising number of young students, especially in rural areas, countries such as Yemen, Egypt and Morocco face a serious obstacle towards achieving universal basic education. In Egypt, guaranteeing education for those aged below 15 is an enormous challenge as more than third of its population is between 6 and 14 with a concentration in rural areas.Zibani, N. Le travail des enfants en Egypte et ses rapports avec la scolarisation: esquisse d'évolution . Egypte/Monde Arabe. Cairo: Cedej, 1994. In the mountainous areas of Yemen, despite substantial efforts to build new schools or repair existing ones, classes may meet outdoors.UNICEF (2000). State of World's Children 2000. New York:UNICEF. Further attempts at raising literacy rates are being processed in the MENA region with a particular emphasis on educating women in rural areas where the level of illiteracy in general is high especially among females. According to the World Bank report in 1999, in the rural areas of Morocco, only one woman out of ten can read and write. The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization reported that over seventy-five million women and forty-five million men across the Middle East and North Africa region were illiterate.United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics, Financing Education- Investments and Returns, Analysis of the World Education Indicators,2002. The quality of education is a crucial issue in economic development. In order to evaluate the quality of education, it is important to understand and evaluate its impacts. Such a process can be through comparative studies both within the MENA region and internationally. However, as only Iran and Jordan have participated in recent international assessment studies, the available data on the quality of education in the MENA region is very low. Both Jordan, which participated in the 1991 International Assessment of Educational Progress, and Iran, which did so in the 1995 Third International Mathematics and Sciences Study, showed a very low level in math and science but with a greatest increase from 1995 to 2011. More importantly, educational systems in MENA do not strongly rely on the inculcation of cognitive problem-solving skills. They are rather encouraged to memorize answers to a limited number of problems in order to pass one exam after another. As a result, they are rewarded for being passive rather than active learners, and in the end graduate into a job-market that values creativity and problem-solving, partially explaining the staggering 25% youth unemployment rate in the Middle East, the highest of any region worldwide.The Middle East Youth Initiative, \\"Inclusion: Meeting the 100 Million Youth Challenge, 2007\\" The costs of youth exclusion, including youth unemployment, have been estimated to reach as high as US$53 billion in Egypt (17% of GDP) and US$1.5 billion in Jordan (7% of GDP).The Middle East Youth Initiative, \\"The Costs of Exclusion in the Middle East\\" Some indicators, such as the available sources of data on individual students or the patterns of expenditure in primary schools, can be helpful in determining the quality of education in MENA. In many MENA primary schools, students have access to a single textbook in every subject each year. This implies that the book itself is the only source of information. Correspondingly, the development of cognitive skills tends to be slow and depends on the student's personal efforts to assimilate new information, hence progress. In addition, such a process can even be slower because of the absence of other reading materials and video programs that may provide further illustrations and make the studied topic clear and understandable. From a different perspective, countries in the Persian Gulf states spent four times more on students in higher education than on students in basic school. Tunisia, Jordan, and Morocco spent correspondingly about 8, 14, and 15 times more on a student in university than on a student in compulsory education. Though it might be argued that this is due to the costs of higher education, governments that spend more than ten times per student in higher education tend to ignore the importance of compulsory education's importance in personal and intellectual development. In the Arab world, the low quality of the educational system is not due to the lack of funding but results from the inadequate management of the available monetary resources directed at improving education in the region. The Education Performance Index that measures the quality of education in the developing countries conveyed a discrepancy between the different countries in the region. They varied in the ways of exploiting the advantages of economic potential for the benefit of their people. Countries such as Tunisia succeeded in investing more than six per cent of its GNP in free public education. As a consequence, more than 1.4 million students could enjoy a free and compulsory education in 1991.Institut national d'études statistiques (1999). Recensement de la population et de l'habitat. Tunis:INES. In other countries such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, despite the available financial resources, basic education was not improved. This can be interpreted as being the result of the low net enrollment rate. Moreover, while the gender gap in compulsory education in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait is not very high, Qatar suffers a gender gap of 20 per cent in students enrollment in basic education. Problems of education quality in the MENA region According to the 2002 Arab Human Development Report, “the most worrying aspect of the crisis in education is education’s inability to provide the requirements for the development of Arab societies.” Despite that both secondary and higher education are regarded as the most suitable sources that provide training and expertise for the future labor force, access to colleges or universities is still limited. In cases when education is available, it suffers from the low quality of its educational system, lack of educational materials or qualified teachers. The financial problem emanates from the region itself: the intervention of government to provide a free education has started to become burdensome as result of the increasing number of students who complete their basic education and seek to further their studies. As a result, the central government faces the challenge to control the unsustainable cost of providing free education for the ever-rising number of students and doing so at different educational levels. From a different perspective, in the MENA region, despite intensive governmental investments in education in order to improve the efficiency of education and rise the level of academic achievement, the quality of education remains a problem.Heyneman, S.P. (1993) 'Human development in the Middle East and North Africa Region.'In Economic Development of the Arab Countries: Selected Issues, ed. S.El-Naggar, pp.204-226.International Monetary Fund, Washington D.C. According to the 1995 World Education Report, although females access to education in the MENA is low when compared to male enrolment rates, the low quality of educational systems in the region affects both males and females. \\"There remains a pressing quality problem in terms of educational outcomes in the region, with pedagogical methods remaining largely focused on rote memorization rather than applied problem solving and assessment methods.\\" One way to explain such phenomenon could be to argue that educational management have not witnessed substantial changes and reforms since the post- independence period. In fact, during the 1950s and the 1960s, educational systems were framed and planned in accordance with the demands of state industries, agriculture and services. The central government used to anticipate the required skills for the future employees before deciding and planning the different educational specializations. No less important, the number of new workers was also determined. Manpower forecasts had to predict the number of employees required in every field prior to students' graduation and completion of secondary or higher education. Similarly, access to higher education was also monitored by government. Very often programs open and close according to governmental planning and in accordance with market demands. Also, the centralized planning helped to determine the necessary technical, manual or professional services that lead to the nation's economic growth. Thereupon, the mobility across specialization was not flexible. In addition, as there was more emphasis on skilled manual and technical professions, academic training was considered irrelevant. Furthermore, entry to the specialized universities of medicine required the acquisition of specific academic experiences taught in specialized secondary schools located in the cities. Consequently, students who lived in urban areas could attend privileged educational institutions. However, students from rural areas very often cannot enjoy the same educational advantages. Most of those willing to continue their education at a higher level are concentrated in the over- crowded technical schools or universities of humanities and social sciences. \\"Educational outcomes have not provided youth with the skills sought out by private sector employers in the region.\\" Gender The right to education is regarded as necessary for women in the Middle East and North Africa. The importance of education for women is to enable them become good mothers for the future and active members in society. While some women perceive that education is their gateway to a better life in which they are able to understand their human rights and subsequently protect themselves against gender discrimination, others believe that educated women are more successful in raising a new generation.Farzaneh Roudi-Fahimi and Valentine M. Moghadam, Empowering Women, Developing Society: Female Education in the Middle East and North Africa, Population Reference Bureau, October 2003.Valentine M. Moghadam, Modernizing Women: Gender and Social Change in the Middle East, 2nd ed. (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2003). In the first half of the 1990s Muslim states increased girls enrollment in primary schools by two per cent, a rate four times higher than the average rate of school-age girls enrollment in developing countries. The rise of girls participation in primary schools aimed at wiping the widespread claims that Islamic rules restricted female access to education.Walkins, K. (1999). Education now:Break the cycle of poverty. London: Oxfam. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the primary school enrollment rate for girls has increased from 80 to 96 per cent in 1986. Similarly, in rural areas, girls enrollment in primary schools has climbed from 60 to 80 per cent in the late 1990s.UNICEF 2000. State of World's Children 2000. New York:UNICEF. In the case of Iran, political commitment to achieve a universal compulsory education in Iran has influenced educational quality. Correspondingly, gender gap in school enrollment has significantly decreased. In addition, several regimes in the Arab world have stressed the importance to improve female's access to education and attempted to reduce gender gaps at different educational levels. Indeed, it is predicted that by the year 2010, Arab countries can reach 70 per cent of literacy rate as result of the sustained improvement of education especially with regards to women. Tunisia stands as an illustrative example of a successful policy that has started in 1956. It aimed at reducing gender gaps. The government's liberal policy towards women has influenced women's status in the country and reduced gender inequality in access to education.Zaimeche, S.E. (1994).Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia: Recent social change and future prospects.Middle Eastern Studies, 33 (4), 944-955. The significant shifts in girls enrollment rates in compulsory schools were experienced by other countries in the MENA region. From 1960 to 1988, girls enrollment rates in Syria, Libya and Iraq have climbed correspondingly from 44 per cent to 94 per cent (Syria), from 26 to 90 per cent (Libya) and from 39 to 88 per cent (Iraq).Gould, W.T.S. (1993). People and Education in the Third World. London: Longman. According to the World Bank, the wider gender gaps across the MENA region are found in Yemen, Morocco and Egypt. In Egypt, more than 600.000 girls aged between 6 and 10 do not go to school. The majority of these uneducated girls are concentrated in rural areas, especially in Upper Egypt.Fergany, N. (1995) Summary of Research: Enrolment in Primary Education and Acquainting Basic Skills in Reading, Writing and Mathematics. Cairo: Al-Mishkat Center for Research and Training. Such phenomenon resulted from the low quality of the national educational system and its provided services in rural areas. This was also backed with the socioeconomic difficulties in the rural areas of Egypt where it is very difficult to afford for basic educational materials. Recommended changes and future reforms An Iranian university class Stephan P.Heyneman identifies six major areas for change: 1-meaningful compulsory education: A meaningful compulsory education implies the necessity to treat 'basic education' and 'compulsory education' equally. This means that education should be universal during the period of compulsory basic education. Compulsory education needs to be universal for all children regardless of their social class, gender, or ethnic group. Such a process requires the redefinition of examinations goals. This signifies that exams need to be used as an evaluative tool rather than a means by which students are selected according to their memorization skills. 2-coherent quality assurance mechanisms: There are four mechanisms that enable the assessment of education's quality. They include \\"curricular objectives, examinations and other assessment, teaching materials and classroom teaching\\". However, in the MENA region, schools lack the resources to facilitate fulfilling educational goals. For instance, textbooks are inadequately organized in ways that do not consider students' varying educational capabilities. Consequently, the coordination between curricular objectives, mechanisms used by teachers, and appropriate selection of examinations can be efficient in conveying a functional and coherent educational system. 3-professionalization of teachers: In the MENA region, teachers are not selected for their competence, creativity, and teaching performance. Rather, they are identified by virtue of their educational attainment. However, salary scales do not differ between teachers at different levels of experience. This very fact has discouraged proactive improvement of teaching and subsequently has reduced the quality of teaching in general. An effective solution to such a challenge would be to introduce continuing evaluations and examinations in order to assess teachers' performance in the classroom. Instructors who succeed in these evaluative examinations may move to a higher salary scale. This process would not only motivate teachers to perform but would positively influence the quality of education in general. 4-educational materials: In the countries of the Middle East and North Africa, there is a general consensus that educational facilities are rare and inappropriately used. However, due to the changing nature of market demand, there is an urge necessity to provide students with professional and technical skills. Indeed, introducing computer software educational programs should be encouraged, organized and implemented. It is suggested that such a process would produce an up-to-date educational system that produces an internationally competitive labor force. Consequently, this does not only improve the quality of education but also creates a valuable and efficient work force. 5-higher education: Most MENA countries have not changed the policies whereby they manage their higher education since the intervention times of central governments in the 1960s and 1970s. In other terms, the financing and delivery procedures have been identical for more than thirty years. This explains the reason why the quality of higher education has decreased. Nevertheless, in order to avoid such state of stagnation in higher educational institutions, there is a need to improve educational delivery materials through the use of modernized teaching strategies, raising access to higher education while providing both qualitative and structural reforms. 6-educational information: Information about the quality of education in MENA is scarce and the available data is often inadequate and unreliable. Nevertheless, in order to be able to adapt to the global open market, governments in the region need to encourage the use of statistics and different data analysis tools that aim at uncovering the status of education for both local responsible authorities and international bodies. Such a process allows an effective assessment and evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of education in the region. Conversely, as a result of the shortage of information about these evaluative data, it is very difficult to determine the reasons for the failure of educational systems in MENA.

It was written by series creators Mark Frost and David Lynch, and directed by Lynch.http://www.tv.com/shows/twin-peaks/pilot-northwest-passage-43982/ The pilot follows the characters of Dale Cooper and Harry S. Truman as they investigate the death of popular high school student Laura Palmer; Cooper believes the murder has connections to a murder case that occurred a year earlier. In addition to setting the tone for the show, the episode sets up several character and story arcs and marked the appearance of several recurring characters. The episode received a strong Nielsen household rating compared to other season one episodes and was well received by fans and critics alike. The original title for the series was Northwest Passage, but this was later changed. Plot overview The small northwest town of Twin Peaks, Washington is shaken when the body of Laura Palmer is discovered washed up on a riverbank, wrapped in plastic. FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper is called in when Ronnette Pulaski, who attended the same high school as Palmer, is found wandering on a bridge before lapsing into a coma. Cooper believes there is a connection between Palmer's death and the death of another girl named Teresa Banks that happened a year earlier. Cooper discovers a small piece of paper with the letter \\"R\\" on it shoved under Laura's fingernail. He tells Sheriff Harry S. Truman that under Banks's nail he found a \\"T\\". Meanwhile, the Palmer family and friends struggle to come to terms with her death, and wonder how it might have come about. Believing that this is the same killer who struck the previous year, Cooper starts an official investigation. Meanwhile, the rebellious Audrey Horne ruins a business deal for her father Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer); Sheriff Truman arrests Palmer's boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), who is secretly seeing a married waitress named Shelly; Palmer's best friend Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) and Palmer's secret boyfriend James Hurley discover a mutual attraction; and Laura's mother is terrified by a vision. The episode has two different endings, depending on which version of the episode one is watching. The American version ends with the above events, concluded by Sarah Palmer's nightmare of a hand digging into the ground and grabbing James's half of a necklace that belonged to Laura. The international version was filmed with 20 extra minutes of footage in case the series was not picked up by the networks, rather allowing them to release it as a Television movie. It contains scenes from episode one, where Sarah realises that there was a man hiding in Laura's room when she checked in it the previous day. It also contains the ending to episode two, when Cooper dreams of meeting Laura and a mysterious man who speaks to him in a disjointed voice. It also reveals who Laura's killers were. Production =Conception and writing= David Lynch and Mark Frost pitched the idea to ABC during the time of the Writers Guild of America, East strike in 1988 in a ten-minute meeting with the network's drama head, Chad Hoffman, with nothing more than this image and a concept. According to the director, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was initially going to be in the foreground, but would recede gradually as viewers got to know the other townsfolk and the problems they were having. Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a police investigation with a soap opera. ABC liked the idea, and asked Lynch and Frost to write a screenplay for the pilot episode. Frost wrote more verbal characters, like Benjamin Horne, while Lynch was responsible for Agent Dale Cooper. According to the director, \\"He says a lot of the things I say\\". Originally, the show was entitled Northwest Passage and set in North Dakota, but the fact that a town called Northwest Passage really exists prompted a revision in the script. They filmed the pilot for $1.8 million with an agreement with ABC that they would shoot an additional \\"ending\\" to it so that it could be sold directly to video in Europe as a feature if the TV show was not picked up. However, even though ABC's Bob Iger liked the pilot, he had a tough time persuading the rest of the network brass. Iger suggested showing it to a more diverse, younger group, who liked it, and the executive subsequently convinced ABC to buy seven episodes at $1.1 million apiece. Some executives figured that the show would never get on the air, believing it would meet negative reviews from viewers and critics alike. However, Iger planned to schedule it for the spring. The final showdown occurred during a bi-coastal conference call between Iger and a room full of New York executives; Iger won, and Twin Peaks was on the air. =Improvised elements= Lynch, the co-writer of the episode as seen in 2007 At several points during the filming of the pilot episode, David Lynch improvised by incorporating on-set accidents into the story. The most notable of these occurred when set decorator Frank Silva was being told to be careful to not get stuck in a room while furniture was being moved around. Lynch heard this and he says that the image of Silva being stuck intrigued him. Lynch then shot some footage of Silva perching behind Laura Palmer's bed, but was unsure as to what he would do with it. Silva was then accidentally filmed in a mirror during Sarah Palmer's vision at the end of the pilot. The camera operator insisted that Lynch do another take because of the mistake, but he liked it so much he kept it in the show, and cast Silva as Killer BOB, the mysterious tormentor of Laura Palmer. During the filming of the scene in which Dale Cooper first examines Laura's body, a malfunctioning fluorescent light above the table flickered constantly, but Lynch decided not to replace it, since he liked the disconcerting effect that it created. Also, during the take, one of the minor actors misheard a line and, thinking he was being asked his name, he told Cooper his real name instead of saying his line, briefly throwing everyone off balance. Lynch was reportedly pleased with the lifelike, unscripted moment in dialogue, and kept the mistake in the final cut.\\"Secrets from Another Place\\", a featurette in the Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition DVD release of October 2007. Previews The pilot was first shown in September 1989 at the Telluride Film Festival. That same month, Connoisseur magazine ran a cover story calling Twin Peaks \\"the series that will change TV forever.\\" After viewing the episode, Tom Shales of the Washington Post wrote \\"Twin Peaks isn’t just a visit to another town; it’s a visit to another planet. Maybe it will go down in history as a brief and brave experiment. But as can be said of few other TV shows in the near or immediate future: This You Gotta See.\\" On February 10, 1990, it was shown as part of the Miami Film Festival. Sun-Sentinel writer Robert Hurlburt wrote \\"the Lynchian sense of impending danger and kinky sexual undercurrents, coupled with excellent music, makes the Twin Peaks pilot work almost too well. You'll want to see the entire package in one sitting. But the series may lay an egg on television because of its drawn-out and deliberate pacing, brutality, sex with violence and a hint of something else ... something deadly, yet unseen and probably repulsive.\\" In April, a screening was also held at the Museum of Broadcasting in Hollywood. Media analyst and advertising executive Paul Schulman said, \\"I don't think it has a chance of succeeding. It is not commercial, it is radically different from what we as viewers are accustomed to seeing, there's no one in the show to root for.\\" Release =Ratings and awards= The two-hour pilot was the highest-rated movie for the 1989–1990 season with a 21.7 rating and was viewed by 34.6 million people. In Los Angeles, Twin Peaks became the seventh most- watched show of the week earning 29% of viewers, the most-watched show being Married... with Children which gathered 34% of viewers. The following episode, \\"Traces to Nowhere\\" would start with a significant drop in ratings with only 23.2 million people tuning in. Various media such as The New York Times and local radio stations announced that the show had managed to grow a cult following. For the 42nd Primetime Emmy Awards, the pilot episode was nominated six times, including \\"Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series\\" for David Lynch, \\"Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\\" for Kyle MacLachlan as Dale Cooper, and \\"Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series\\" for Mark Frost and Lynch. The pilot won two awards, with frequent Lynch collaborator Patricia Norris winning for \\"Outstanding Costume Design for a Series\\" and Duwayne Dunham winning the \\"Outstanding Editing for a Series - Single Camera Production\\". The pilot also received a Peabody Award in 1990. The pilot's international release tells the story of the series in a self-contained manner, and includes 20 minutes of additional footage. =Critical reception= Initially, the show's Thursday night time slot was not a good one for soap operas as both Dynasty and its short-lived spin-off The Colbys did poorly. Twin Peaks was also up against the hugely successful sitcom Cheers. Initially, the show received a positive response from TV critics. Tom Shales, in the Washington Post, wrote, \\"Twin Peaks disorients you in ways that small-screen productions seldom attempt. It's a pleasurable sensation, the floor dropping out and leaving one dangling.\\" In the New York Times, John J. O'Connor wrote, \\"Twin Peaks is not a sendup of the form. Mr. Lynch clearly savors the standard ingredients...but then the director adds his own peculiar touches, small passing details that suddenly, and often hilariously, thrust the commonplace out of kilter.\\" Many critics saw the pilot as \\"the movie that will change TV\\" history, according to Diana White from the Boston Globe. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly was strongly positive about the episode, giving it a A+. While liking the story, and calling Lynch's directing beautiful, he said \\"[there is] not a chance in hell\\" the show could become a ratings hit, because of its \\"unsettling\\" story. David Zurawik from The Baltimore Sun compared the pilot to the work of Alfred Hitchcock. He also said its cinematography was \\"about as close as prime-time television gets to art.\\" Jen Chaney from The Washington Post called the pilot \\"one of the most finely crafted series kick-offs in broadcast history\\". In 1997, TV Guide ranked the pilot #25 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes. =Home video release= Due to rights issues, the American pilot (94 minutes long) was not released in the United States home video market until 2007. The European pilot (116 minutes) had been released on VHS and laser disc years earlier: this alternate version of the pilot was aired in Europe as a stand- alone television movie. The European version is identical to the United States-aired version up until the last several scenes, when the killer of Laura Palmer is revealed. Both versions of the pilot are included in the Twin Peaks: Definitive Gold Box Edition DVD set, released in the US on October 30, 2007. Lynch was so pleased with the footage shot for the European ending that he later incorporated some of it into Cooper's dream sequences that aired in subsequent episodes.

It is most commonly used for mapping the social structure within small teams (10-25 people). Sociomapping uses the landscape metaphor to display complex multi-dimensional data in a 3D map, where individual objects are localized in such way that their distance on the map corresponds to their distance in the underlying data. Thanks to its visual coding Sociomapping engages our evolved skills for spatial orientation and movement detection, thus making the interpretation of complex data easy and accessible for everyone. History The sociomapping method was developed in 1993-1994 by R. Bahbouh as a tool that would facilitate understanding of data about social relations and help preventing conflicts within teams of military professionals. The first major application of sociomapping took place in 1994-1995 during the HUBES experiment (Human Behavior in Extended Spaceflight) – a 135-day-long simulation of a spaceflight with three crew members organized by European Space Agency. Sociomapping was then regularly used in other spaceflight simulations (1995-1996: EKOPSY, 1999: Mars105, 2010-2012: Mars500). Since 2005, sociomapping has been extensively used in business environment to analyze relationships within senior management teams. In 2012, C. Höschl jr. developed Real Time Sociomapping® software that enables instant visualization of the team dynamics and monitoring of the teams and social groups over time. Basic principle The basic principle of Sociomapping is transforming original data concerning a set of objects in such a way that the distance of each pair of objects on the map corresponds to the distance between the two objects in the underlying data. Transformation of the data is a matter of 1) choosing some metric that could be reasonably interpreted as distance, and 2) translating the multi-dimensional distance matrix into 2D coordinate system so that the correlation between map-distances and data-distances is maximized. The algorithm for data-transformation, developed by C. Höschl jr., is thus a dimensionality-reduction technique, such as PCA, and its goodness of fit can be measured by Spearman correlation between the map-distances and data-distances. Sociomapping takes into account that, particularly in case of social relations, relational data may be asymmetrical (e.g. John like Mary more than she likes him) and preserves this information by mapping the objects in such a way that for each object the closest other object is the one closest to it according to the metric of choice in the underlying data, and so on for other objects ordered by distance. Application There are two main areas of application for Sociomapping – groups (small systems) and populations (large systems). For each area a different method of visualization and data transformation is used in order to facilitate people’s ability to understand and interpret the analyzed data. =Groups and small systems= Sociomapping for small systems produces Sociomaps of subjects. These subjects (in most cases people) are placed on the Sociomap reflecting their distance measured in various ways: * social distance * psychological distance (psychological similarity) * communication distance * other relation measures Besides the distances between the group members, Sociomap shows additional variable coded in the height (or color) of the subject. Typical variables used for the height are: social status, performance indicators of the subjects, average communication frequency, etc. Understanding the relative distances between the people helps to understand the structure of the group, find subgroups formed by groups members and discover functions of the group members. In connection to the height Sociomap enables complex and comprehensive insight into the groups and small systems. This is particularly beneficial for workplace strategists. Sociomapping of small systems produces similar results to social network analysis with additional visualization features. =Profile analysis= Besides the small systems analysis based on various relational data, Sociomapping can be used to visualize the profiles of unrelated subjects. This is done by transformation of profiles of the subjects, computing the distances between the profiles and visualizing them in a Sociomap. There is a software to compute Profile analysis (see section Sociomapping software) =Populations and large systems= For large systems and populations, different type of Sociomaps is used. Data used for these type of maps are rectangular matrices, where for each subject there is a preference vector of selected objects (such as political parties, brands, products, and so on). In order to create a Sociomap, for each subject a position in the map is determined, and a small piece of mass representing this subject is placed on the map according to its vector of preferences to an object. As a result, there are places on the Sociomap where more subject are placed (hills) and where there are no subject (valleys). Therefore, hills are formed on the places representing typical preference configurations and this allows for visual cluster analysis, or segmentation. In this sense, Large systems Sociomapping is a data mining approach based on visual pattern recognition). Typical uses for Large systems Sociomapping are: * political research (preferences and polls) * marketing research (attitudes and product preferences) * customer segmentation (behavioral patterns) * and other research concerned with preferences and/or attitudes. Broader scope of application Sociomapping has broader scope of application, including the following fields: *Historical events analysis (e.g. RMS Titanic survival rate) *Internet community tools (e.g. Last.fm profile similarity) *Literature analysis (e.g. analysis of communication in Shakespeare plays) *Military units and human spaceflight crews analysis *Sport analysis and forecast (e.g. cooperation of sport teams) *Politics analysis and forecast *Team building *Team analysis (communication, cooperation, decision- making) *Leadership development *Team collaboration - remote collaboration or hybrid teams *Prevention of socio-pathological behavior among children at schools Software So far only one software tool based on Sociomapping was released. Team profile analyzer is a tool for psychologists, consultants, managers and HR specialists. It enables integration of various sources of information about team from personality, performance or knowledge tests and biographical data. It can be used for team analysis and development: team coaching, team building, recruitment etc. See also *Participatory rural appraisal *High-performance teams *Human resources *Marketing research *Sociometry *Team management References * Sociomapping Portal with information and resources about Sociomapping * The Application of Sociomapping to Executive Team Development * Utilization of multilayer network data of team for Sociomapping analysis Category:Cartography Category:Interdisciplinary subfields of sociology Category:Social science methodology Category:Social networks ","title":"Sociomapping"},{"id":"10748669","text":"Environmental dependency syndrome, also called Zelig syndrome or Zelig-like syndrome from the name of the protagonist of Woody Allen's Zelig, is a syndrome where the affected individual relies on environmental cues in order to accomplish goals or tasks.

Doris Lessing spoke highly of the book in 2004: \\"Reading it rather like finding yourself in a dream.\\" The Times Literary Supplement praised the novel: \\"The language has the pared-down simplicity of a fable; the effect is a bit like that of a Haruki Murakami novel.\\" Guo's 2008 novel, A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers, is the first one that she wrote in English after publishing her Chinese books.Xiaolu Guo, Once Upon A Time in the East: A Story of Growing up, Chatto & Windus, 2017, chapter \\"To be published and to be known\\", pp. 263–266 (). It tells the journey of a young Chinese woman in London. She soon renames herself \\"Z\\" and her encounters with an unnamed Englishman spur both of them to explore their own sense of identity. The novel is written in the heroine's broken English to begin with, in a dictionary form. With each chapter her English gradually improves, reflecting the improvement of the heroine's own English over the year in which the novel is set. American writer Ursula Le Guin reviewed the book in The Guardian: \\"We're in the hands of someone who knows how to tell a story [...] It succeeds in luring the western reader into an alien way of thinking: a trick only novels can pull off, and indeed one of their finest tricks.\\"Ursula Le Guin, \\"Review: A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers\\", The Guardian, 27 January 2007.

It received the Best Script Prize at the Hamburg International Film Festival. Guo's 2010 novel, 20 Fragments of A Ravenous Youth, is a coming-of-age story about a 21-year-old Chinese woman Fenfang, her life as a film extra in Beijing, to which she has travelled far to seek her fortune, only to encounter a Communist regime that has outworn its welcome, a city in varying degrees of development, and sexism more in keeping with her peasant upbringing than the country's supposedly progressive capital. Guo's 2010 book, Lovers in the Age of Indifference, is a collection of short stories that depicts the lives of people adrift between the West and the East, set in various locations. In 2015, Xiaolu Guo published the novel I Am China, which she describes as \\"a parallel story about two Chinese lovers in exile – the external and internal exile that I had felt since leaving China\\".Xiaolu Guo, Once Upon A Time in the East: A Story of Growing up, Chatto & Windus, 2017, p. 269 (). In the book, the London-based literary translator Iona Kirkpatrick discovers a story of romance and revolution as she translates a collection of letters and diaries by a Chinese punk musician named Kublai Jian. Unbeknownst to Iona, Jian has come to Britain seeking political asylum, while another character, Mu, is in Beijing trying to track him down.

The abbey, which for much of its history was under Benedictine rule, is now entrusted to the Rosminians. A special regional law acknowledges it as the \\"Symbolic monument of the Piedmont region\\".sacradisanmichele.com Saint Michael's Abbey This monumental abbey served as one of the inspirations for the book The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco.L'abbaye qui a inspiré \\"Le Nom de la rose\\" d'Umberto Eco bientôt classée à l'Unesco ? (French). History Tower of Bell'Alda. Façade of the Abbey. According to some historians, in Roman times a military stronghold existed on the current location of the abbey, commanding the main road leading to Gaul from Italy. Later, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Lombards built a fortress here against the Frankish invasions. Little is known of the early years of the abbey. The oldest extant account is that of a monk, William, who lived here in the late 11th century and wrote a Chronicon Coenobii Sancti Michaelis de Clusa. He sets the foundation of the abbey in 966, but, in another passage, the same monk maintains that the construction began under the pontificate of Sylvester II (999-1003). What is certain is that what is now the crypt was built in the late 10th century, as attested by the Byzantine influence in the niches, columns and arches. According to tradition, this building was constructed by the hermit Saint Giovanni Vincenzo San Giovanni Vincenzo from the site Santi, beati e testimoni. at the behest of the archangel Michael to whom he was particularly devoted; and the building materials which the hermit had collected were transported miraculously to the top of the mountain. In addition, it is noted that the cult of St. Michael, the archangel who warred with Lucifer, typically bases its churches on pinnacles or hard to reach places, for example, Mont Saint-Michel in France. In the following years a small edifice was added, which could house a small community of monks and some pilgrims. Later the abbey developed under the Benedictine rule, with the construction of a separate building with guest-rooms for pilgrims following the popular Via Francigena and of a church-monastery (1015–1035), probably on the remains of the ancient Roman castrum. During Easter in 1098, St Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, visited the monastery to see his nephew Anselm, who was a brother here. The younger Anselm would go on to serve as abbot of St Saba in Rome and Bury St Edmunds in England. Abbot Ermengardo (1099–1131) had a new large, 26 m-high basement built from the foot of the hill to its peak, on which a new church (the one still existing today) was added, including the surrounding structures. In the year 1315, the manuscript Breviary of San Michele della Chiusa was written containing the prayer cycle of the year for the monks of the Abbey. The Breviary of San Michele della Chiusa (1315) page with thumbnail. The monastery fell into decline and was finally suppressed in 1622 by Pope Gregory XV. It remained abandoned until 1835, when King Charles Albert and the Pope asked Antonio Rosmini to restore and repopulate it. It is currently under the care of the Rosminians. Art and architecture The Sacra di San Michele in 2015 View of Val Susa from Sacra The church's high altar window. The church is located atop a rocky crag base and towers above the valley. The church façade leads to a staircase, the Scalone dei Morti (\\"Stairway of the Dead\\"), flanked by arches, niches and tombs in which, until recent times, skeletons of dead monks were visible (hence the name). At the top of the 243 steps is the marble Porta dello Zodiaco, a masterwork of 12th century sculpture. The church itself is accessed by a Romanesque portal in grey and green stone, built in the early 11th century. The church has a nave and two aisles, and features elements of both Gothic and Romanesque architecture. On the left wall is a large fresco portraying the Annunciation (1505), while in the Old Choir is a triptych by Defendente Ferrari. The complex includes the ruins of the 12th-15th centuries monastery, which had five floors. It ends with the Torre della Bell'Alda (\\"Tower of the Beautiful Alda\\") The so-called \\"Monks' Sepulchre\\" is probably the remains of a chapel reproducing, in its octagonal plan, the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem.

The locality is about south-east of the town of Beaconsfield. The 2016 census has a population of 4029 for the state suburb of Legana. It is 12 kilometres north of Tasmania's second largest city, Launceston. It is adjacent to Riverside, Bridgenorth, Grindelwald and Rosevears. The name \\"Legana\\" is based on the Palawa word for \\"fresh water\\" since it is at the point where the Tamar River becomes fresh water. There is currently a homestead called \\"Freshwater\\" which was adjacent to a private jetty where early settlers traded with the local natives. This homestead, in Nobelius Drive, now operates as a Bed and Breakfast accommodation house. History Legana was originally a rural town made up of dairy farms, apple orchards, and cattle grazing. Most of the residences were originally located near the Tamar River with housing developments built nearer to the West Tamar Highway. Legana was also originally called Legana Estate. Legana was gazetted as a locality in 1963. Legana Post Office opened on 1 April 1910. Geography The waters of the Tamar River estuary form the north-eastern, eastern and south-eastern boundaries. Road infrastructure The West Tamar Highway (Route A7) passes through from south-east to north- west. Route C732 (Bridgenorth Road) starts at an intersection with A7 and runs west until it exits. Route C733 (Rosevears Drive) starts at an intersection with A7 and runs north until it exits. Community Like most smaller rural townships, sporting clubs play an important part of the social life of Legana. Most of the community facilities are located within a community precinct which accommodates the Legana Cricket Club who compete in the TCL cricket competition running two teams, and although struggle they try hard, the Legana Tennis Club, and children's community playground, near the playground the council are planning to build a bicycle dirt jump park for the local youths to ride their bikes on. The memorial hall is near to this precinct. A shopping centre has been built on the other side of this community precinct which provides the community with a supermarket and number of speciality shops. The shopping centre has had an upgrade and has been extended from the side and the back. Recently the area has had more developments in that businesses have decided to take advantage of this growing community: Legana now has a post office and a newsagent with Tatts Lotto, chemist, butcher, baker, hairdresser, KFC, Legana Tavern, BWS Bottle Shop, Legana Medical Centre, Launceston Holiday Park Caravan Park, Lawson Homes, Legana Bakery, Legana Plants Plus Nursery, Legana Hair & Beauty Salon, florist, R&R; Caravan Centre, Reject Shop, Scotts Motorcycle Spares, Newman Automotive, Velo Vineyard, Impact kitchens, Salvation Army, St John's Foot Clinic, Tyres and More, Eyelines Glasses & Frames & Repairs, Harcourt's Real Estate, Woolworths, Woolworth's Petrol Plus, 2 ATM'S at Woolworths, as well as other new shops. A fire station, Legana Fire Brigade consists of a group of enthusiastic volunteers who provide the community with a fire protection service equipped to respond to both structure and vegetation fires, car accidents, fire alarms. Legana Brigade was formed soon after the devastating 1967 bushfires in Tasmania. Legana Fire Brigade's first piece of equipment was a tanker trailer, purchased by the then Beaconsfield Council under a Rural Fires Board subsidy scheme, and housed at the Brigade Captain's property. At about this time the Legana area began to change from an agricultural base community to one of a rural residential nature with a sub-division at Freshwater Point. As a result, the Council provided a four-wheel drive medium tanker which again was housed at the Brigade Captain's As Legana' s population grew the existing members felt that the Fire Commission should provide a more suitable shed which was built in the early 80's. The members went further however and after much hard work, fund- raising and lobbying they were able to ensure that a meeting room and office were incorporated into the new station that was finally opened in 1985. The station was located on the old Freshwater Point Road but the developments of Grindelwald, Rosevears Danbury Park and the general expansion of Legana itself lead to plans being discussed in 1996 for a larger replacement station in a more central location. Churches in Legana include the Legana Christian Church, a for profit business in Gerrard Close, and the Free Reformed Church in Outreach Drive. Bus services Legana has no schools, but is adequately serviced by several bus services for children to get to nearby schools. All bus services in Legana are run by Manions Buses. The \\"Legana Loop\\" route travels to and from Launceston. Local government Legana is a part of the West Tamar Municipality.

Battle of Toverud Toverud monument (Toverudstøtta) In February 1808, Denmark-Norway was forced by Napoleon Bonaparte to declare war on Sweden. On 14 April 1808 a Swedish brigade crossed the border and went west to Aurskog, Norway. After a brief but dramatic battle, Swedish commander Axel Otto Mörner (1774-1852) had to surrender. Danish nobleman Christian August of Augustenborg successfully commanded the army of Norway and compelled the numerically superior Swedish forces to withdraw behind the border after the Battle of Toverud on April 19–20, 1808.Christian August, Prins af Slesvig-Holsten-Sønderborg-Augustenborg (Project Runeberg - Dansk biografisk Lexikon ) One contributory factor behind the poor performance of the Swedish invasion force in Norway was that Russia had invaded Finland on February 21, 1808 at the start of the Finnish War. The two-front war proved disastrous for Sweden.The Swedish-Russian War of 1808-09 (Finska kriget 1808-09)Russo-Swedish War 1808 (Armed Conflict Events Database) The success of Christian August both as a military commander at Toverud and in the subsequent battle on June 10, 1808 at Prestebakke in Østfold, and as leader of the provisional government made him very popular in Norway. In 1808 Christian August was promoted to Field Marshal, and in 1809 he became Governor-general of Norway. Prince Christian August was also held in high esteem within Sweden because he had refrained from pursuing the retreating army of Sweden while that country was hard pressed by Russia in the Finnish War. Consequently, Christian August was elected Crown Prince of Sweden as successor to the Swedish throne after the overthrow of the incompetent King Gustav IV Adolf.

The mission is to improve the lives of children with insulin-dependent diabetes through education, recreation, and support programs which inspire and empower.Barton Center for Diabetes Education Homepage History In 1921, on the 100th anniversary of the birth of Clara Barton, humanitarian and founder of the American Red Cross, the Women's National Missionary Association of the Universalist Church purchased her home in North Oxford, Massachusetts. The property included a farmhouse, a barn, and of land. The home was restored as a museum, and in 1925, a \\"fresh air camp\\" for inner-city youths was opened. This humanitarian endeavor was designed to honor Clara Barton, herself a Universalist. Concurrently, in 1921, insulin was discovered in Canada by Drs. Frederick Banting and Charles Best. While the Universalist Women were building the \\"camp\\", Dr. Elliott P. Joslin (also born in Oxford, MA) became one of the first physicians to use insulin to save the lives of children with diabetes. Children from across the country came to Boston to be treated by Dr. Joslin. Care for children with diabetes became his passion. In 1932, Dr. Joslin and the Universalist women joined forces to create The Clara Barton Birthplace Camp,Barton Center History an \\"island of safety\\" for children with diabetes. The women provided property and funding, while Dr. Joslin became the first medical director of the camp, serving eight girls during the first year. The Clara Barton Birthplace Camp was revered around the world as the first \\"hospital in the woods\\" and many smaller programs were modeled after it. In 1948, the enormous success of the \\"camp experiment\\" at the Barton homestead inspired Dr. Joslin to ask the Universalist Women to open another camp for boys on property purchased by Dr. Joslin in Charlton, MA. The Universalist Women agreed to administer both programs while Dr. Joslin and his staff provided the medical coverage. The \\"Barton\\" camp for girls and \\"Joslin\\" camp for boys became among the largest and most recognized programs of their kind in the world. Ultimately, the financial burden of operating the boys and girls camps became too difficult, and the women’s organization began divesting itself of the responsibility of the boys' camp, relinquishing control to the Joslin Diabetes Center of Boston in 1976. In early 2008, in a move that brought the girls' and boys' camps back together after 31 years apart, The Barton Center entered into an agreement with Joslin Diabetes Center to assume the management and operation of Camp Joslin. While Joslin Diabetes Center retained ownership of Camp Joslin, The Barton Center was thrilled to combine Camp Joslin's services to its already thriving programs, thereby expanding the opportunities for girls and boys alike.The Barton Center - News & Events The North Oxford site was dedicated in 1932 to educating children with diabetes and has been in continuous operation ever since.

His work marks the transition from late Gothic traditions to Renaissance art in the region. Life and work Ferrari was born at Chivasso, near Turin. Here he trained and initially worked in the workshop of Giovanni Martino Spanzotti. Spanzotti had been the pre-eminent painter in western Piedmont after moving to Chivasso c. 1502.

Web. 30 March 2016 Defendente achieved considerable success as a painter of polyptychs and altarpieces. He painted a number of nocturnal scenes such as the Nativity in Nocturnal Light (1510, Museo Civico d'Arte Antica di Torino). He left a number of signed and dated works.Italian Paintings: North Italian School, a collection catalog containing information about Ferrari and his works (see index; plate 58), p. 17 His work developed away from its initial harsh style following Gothic traditions towards the use of more fluid brushstrokes and the creation of soft, dense highlights more in line with Renaissance painting. His style seems to indicate that he may have known the work of northern European artists such as Rogier van der Weyden, while his later work shows the influence of Macrino d'Alba.

Its seat is the village of Dobrcz, which lies approximately north-east of Bydgoszcz. The gmina covers an area of , and as of 2006 its total population is 9,215. It contains 21 sołectwos. The area is mainly agricultural, although the gmina also has about 1,000 hectares of forest.  History  The first records of Dobrcz date from 1213 when the bishop of Kraków, Iwan Odrowąż, handed over his family estate to the Cistercian monastery in Sulejów. Later on, Dobrcz became the property of the Cistercian order in Byszewo. The area of the commune and the vicinity of Strzelce Dolne can be associated with the Dutch settlement of the mid-16th century. It contributed to the development of technical knowledge with respect to melioration and recovery of wet cropland. During the Prussian annexation, Dobrcz and its vicinity became the place where the policy of Germanisation was implemented. Due to this fact, the most affluent regions in Włóki and Borówno passed to Germans. After Poland regained its independence, Dobrcz was incorporated into the rural commune Bydgoszcz II in 1928 and in 1933 Dobrcz commune was established. The remnants of Hitler's occupation and terror are places sanctified with Polish blood such as the cemetery in Borówno, where approximately one thousand victims are buried. The monument of Heroes, erected in Włóki in 1947, is a tribute to Polish soldiers killed in 1939 and buried here in a collective grave.  Historic buildings  Gmina Dobrcz has several historic buildings: *The Church of St. Wawrzyniec, built in the mid 19th century and rebuilt after the fire at the end of the 19th century. *In Włóki, St. Mary Magdalen's Church, built of wood towards the end of the 17th century. *Mansion in Gąecz from the mid 19th century with a horse- chestnut avenue presently housing the State House of Social Welfare for Adults. *Mansion in Trzęsacz with a landscape park, picturesque view on a steep slope descending towards the Vistula. *Manor in Kotomierz built after 1850 with a new wing annexed towards the end of the 19th century, situated in a park next to farm buildings. *19th-century mansion complex with a brick mansion building in Strzelce Górne, now housing a primary school.  Natural amenities  The picturesque roads leading through the area of commune include the road from Bydgoszcz to Świecie, the road between Kotomierz and Sienno with over 270 trees including 260 oaks, the road near Strzelce Dolne with a beautiful view over the extensive preglacial valley of the Vistula. The Borówno Lake is a popular local attraction, with an easily accessible season camp in the summer. There are also many recreational garden plots in Nekla. Two tourist routes lead through the Lower Vistula valley (52 km), via Strzelce Górne, Gądecz, Chełmszczonka, Trzęsacz, Zła Wieś and Kozielec. The other is the route of along the Koronowo lakes.

Influenced by heavy blues and rock bands like The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream, the band melded the unorthodox time signatures and orchestration of progressive rock and the intensity of blues and hard rock music, creating a unique sound that distinguished them from other Greek rock acts of that period. Outside Greece, Socrates is best known for Phos, their 1976 landmark collaboration album with Vangelis. The group has gone through many lineup changes, but the two core members remained: guitarist Yannis Spathas and bassist/singer Antonis Tourkogiorgis. Spathas died in 2019, aged 68. History Socrates began its career in the clubs of Athens, most prominently the popular Kyttaro. They were present at a number of other locations in and around Victoria Square in Athens. In addition to performing originals, Socrates often covered Jimi Hendrix songs, none of which were featured on any studio releases; a thirteen- minute cover of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" by the Rolling Stones, however, found its way onto their 1972 album Taste of Conium. Yannis Spathas favored two sunburst Fender Stratocasters, a Candy Apple Red Roland GR-505 guitar synthesizer, a black Gibson Les Paul Custom and a cherry sunburst Les Paul Standard. Antonis Tourkogiorgis played a mid-1970s natural ash-bodied Fender Jazz Bass, a Warwick Corvette Double Buck bass and sang, while several drummers were used throughout the live shows and recording sessions. In 1975, Socrates went through a change in stylistic direction with Phos, which featured Vangelis' production and contributions on many tracks. Phos was mostly reworkings of older songs by Socrates. Both LPs On the Wings and Phos were issued in the USA via Neil Kempfer-Stocker's Prog imprint Cosmos. In 2002, Socrates reunited in an extended form (featuring keyboards and a second singer) to do several shows around Greece. This lineup remains active. Yannis Spathas died on 6 July 2019, aged 68.

He was the ordinary of the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia and the archbishop and primate of the Traditional Anglican Communion, an international body of continuing Anglican churches, from 2003 to 2012. Life Hepworth began his seminary studies in 1960 at St Francis Xavier Seminary in Adelaide. In 1968 he was ordained to the priesthood in the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Adelaide. In 1972 he moved to Britain. After returning to Australia in 1976 he was received into the Anglican Church of Australia as a priest. From 1976 to 1977 he had permission to officiate in the Anglican Diocese of Ballarat. From 1977 to 1978 he was the assistant priest in the Colac parish and, from 1978 to 1980, was the rector of the South Ballarat parish based in Sebastopol.Crockford's Clerical Directory (1980–1982): p457. In 1992 Hepworth joined the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia (ACCA). On 29 June 1996 he was consecrated as a bishop, together with Robert John Friend, in the Pro- Cathedral of the Resurrection, Brisbane, by bishops Albert N. Haley (then diocesan bishop of the ACCA), Robert C. Crawley (Anglican Catholic Church of Canada), Wellborn Hudson (Anglican Church in America) and John Hazlewood (retired Bishop of Ballarat in the Anglican Church of Australia). Hepworth served as an assistant bishop until April 1998 when Bishop Friend (who had succeeded Haley as diocesan) resigned. From then until November 1999, Hepworth acted as bishop administrator. At the national synod of the ACCA, held from 25 to 29 November 1999, he was elected as the new diocesan bishop. In 2002 he was elected as primate of the Traditional Anglican Communion (TAC) in succession to Louis Falk. Hepworth was involved in a process to create an Australian ordinariate for former Anglicans in the Roman Catholic Church. His personal history complicated the situation. He was not raised Anglican, but had left the Catholic Church and then married twice and had three children. On 1 March 2012, the TAC bishops voted against union with the Roman Catholic Church. They also voted to accept Hepworth's already announced resignation as TAC primate with immediate effect.TAC votes out Archbishop Hepworth, rejects union with Catholic Church On 16 May 2012, the TAC College of Bishops suspended Hepworth, meaning that he ceased to be the TAC Bishop Ordinary of Australia.Archbishop John Hepworth Suspended from TAC College of Bishops Hepworth has a degree in political science and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Adelaide in 1982 with a thesis about Catholic Action entitled \\"The Movement Revisited: A South Australian Perspective\\".

Biography =Early life and ancestry= Emmanuel Charles Quist was born in 1880 in Christiansborg, Accra. He was the son of the Rev. Carl Quist (1843– 99), a Basel Mission minister from Osu, Accra. His Ga-Danish mother, Paulina Richter, descended from the Royal House of Anomabo. Richter's ancestor was Heinrich Richter (1785–1849), a prominent Euro-African from Osu. Richter's descendants also included Philip Christian Richter (b. 1903), an academic and Presbyterian minister and Ernest Richter (b. 1922), a diplomat. Carl Quist was also of Ga-Danish ancestry and a son of one of the three Kvist brothers (anglicised to Quist) who came to the Gold Coast via Holland in 1840. The brothers, all ethnic Danes, settled separately in Cape Coast, Christiansborg and Keta. E. C. Quist was also related to the historically notable Clerk family of Accra, through his cousin, Anna Alice Meyer (1873 – 1934) whose husband was the theologian and Basel missionary, Nicholas Timothy Clerk (1862 – 1961). =Education and career= From 1889 to 1896, E. C. Quist had his primary and middle school education at the Basel Mission Grammar School and the boys' boarding school, the Salem School respectively. He then attended the Basel Mission Seminary, a theological seminary and teacher- training college at Akropong, Akwapim District where he received training in pedagogy and theology and graduated as a teacher-catechist. He served as the headmaster of his alma mater, the Salem School, Osu from 1899 to 1902. Quist resigned from the teaching profession to pursue a career in commerce. Briefly entering business with the Basel Mission Trading Company, he entered the Middle Temple in England in 1910 and was called to the Bar on 10 April 1913, along with Sir James Henley Coussey who later chaired the Constitutional Committee set up in December 1949 to draw up a new Constitution for the Gold Coast. On his return from London, Quist enrolled as a barrister in private practice at the Gold Coast Bar, establishing his chambers in Accra. Quist became the first African Crown Counsel in the Gold Coast Civil Service, equivalent to the position of a State Attorney. He resigned from his position as a Crown Counsel within a year to focus on his work as a defence lawyer. He was a member of the Accra Town Council from 1919 to 1929. He was an extraordinary member of the Legislative Council in 1925, serving as a legal advisor to the Eastern Provincial Council of Chiefs. He was elected a member of the Legislative Council, representing the Eastern Province, from 1934 to 1948. He was appointed a member of the Achimota College Council. A puisne judge at the Cape Coast judicature from 1948 to 1949, E. C. Quist was the first African President of the Legislative Council from May 1949 to 1951, Speaker of the National Assembly of the Gold Coast from 1951 to 1957, and Speaker of the National Assembly of Ghana from March 1957 until his retirement on 14 November 1957. During this period, his colleagues in parliament re-elected him as Speaker during the general elections of 1954 and 1956. The elevation of Quist in 1949 happened after the last Governor of the Gold Coast, Sir Charles Arden-Clarke relinquished his concurrent post as the President of the Legislative Council. Quist visited the British House of Commons in 1950. On 26 October 1950, he partook in the Speaker's Procession at the Palace of Westminster, as the official guest of the then Speaker, Douglas Clifton Brown, 1st Viscount Ruffside, during the opening of a new session that year. In 1957, he presided over the special state opening of Parliament on Ghana's Independence Day, 6 March, which was witnessed by several visiting international dignitaries including Katharine, Duchess of Kent, Queen Elizabeth II's special representative for the occasion as well as the then US Vice President Richard Nixon.  Personal life  On 27 June 1929, Quist married Dinah Nita Bruce of Christiansborg, Accra. Dinah Bruce was from the prominent Bruce family of Accra whose members included Gold Coast physician and journalist, Frederick Nanka-Bruce as well as Ghanaian musician, King Bruce. Quist had two daughters Paulina Quist (Mrs. Clerk) and Dinah Quist (Mrs. Annang). Emmanuel Quist was a patron of a number of social clubs: the Accra Turf Club, the Rodger Club and the Boy Scouts Movement.  Death and state funeral  Upon Quist's death in 1959, the Ghanaian government accorded him a state funeral with full military honours. After the ceremony at the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu, his body was interred at the Osu Cemetery in Accra. Honours and legacy Quist was created O.B.E. in 1942, \\"for public services in the Gold Coast,\\" and Knighted in 1952.\\"The Speakers' Conference Hall\\" at the Parliament House has been named after Sir Emmanuel Charles Quist. A commemorative plaque, sponsored by his wife, Lady Dinah Quist, was erected in his memory in the sanctuary of the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu where he was a congregant.

It is also known as the bleeding milkcap, as is at least one other member of the genus, Lactarius deliciosus. Description The mushroom can be either a bluish green or an orangy brown hue, with creamy white or yellow spores that are ellipsoid in shape. The cap of the mushroom is convex and sometimes shield-shaped and across, reaching a height of tall. The cap also has quite an underfolded margin and a depressive disk. Lactarius rubrilacteus has many laticifers which appear as a white network across the surface of the mushroom. When sliced or cut, the mushroom flesh will typically release a dark red to purple latex or milky substance. The flesh itself will lose colour when damaged, and is usually granular or brittle to the touch. The stem is quite thin, being only several centimetres in any dimension, and is of an average size and shape for a mushroom. The fungus itself exudes a slight odour that is faintly aromatic. This mushroom is edible. Commonly found with a small blue or green mushroom attached at the base. Bruises green. Distribution and habitat The mushroom is primarily found in parts of western North America, growing in forests and on the ground. The mushroom usually finds cover under conifer trees, mainly Douglas Fir. It is widely distributed in these areas between the months of June and October. Chemical reactivity *Potassium hydroxide: When the mushroom comes in contact with potassium hydroxide, the most of the mushroom, including the mantle and ectomycorrhizae, loses its bluish hue and becomes a dull brown. *Melzer's Reagent: Hardly any visible reaction on any part of the mushroom occurs. This particular mushroom appears to have little reactivity to Melzer's Reagent. *Sulfovanillin: Most of the mushroom becomes a reddish-brown color, but the oldest roots of the fungi stay unaltered by contact with sulfovanillin.

He played one match for the Players against the Gentlemen in 1914. Jeeves joined the British Army in the First World War and was killed in action in 1916. P. G. Wodehouse named his character Jeeves after him. Cricket career Percy Jeeves was born on 5 March 1888 in Earlsheaton, near Dewsbury in Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom. He was the son of Edwin Jeeves, a passenger guard for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, and Edwin's wife Nancy Jeeves, née Garforth.Halford (2013), pp. 20, 27, 171. Percy Jeeves had two older brothers, Thomas and Alick, and a younger brother, Harold.Halford (2013), pp. 39, 42–43. Jeeves's family moved to Goole in 1901, when Jeeves's father was transferred there.Halford (2013), p. 28. Jeeves played cricket at Goole Cricket Club, and became a professional player at Hawes Cricket Club. In 1910, he had a trial with the Yorkshire County Cricket Club.S. Santall, \\"A Chat with Percy Jeeves\\", Cricket, 15 November 1913, pp. 693–95. In late summer 1910, Warwickshire County Cricket Club secretary Rowland Ryder saw Jeeves playing at Hawes and was impressed. Later in 1910, Warwickshire CCC's general committee decided to make Jeeves an offer of engagement for 1911. He accepted and moved to Birmingham in 1911. A player was required to live in a county for two years before being eligible to play for that county in the County Championship, so Jeeves spent 1911 playing minor matches and working around Warwickshire's Edgbaston Cricket Ground.Halford (2013), pp. 48–50. In 1912, he was allocated to Moseley Cricket Club as their professional in the Birmingham League.Halford (2013), p. 53. While still qualifying for the county championship, he played his first two first-class matches in 1912 for Warwickshire against the Australian and South African touring teams. His first-class debut was on 30 May 1912 against the Australian team. In 1913, mainly a fast-medium bowler, he took 106 wickets in first-class matches, at 20.88, and scored 765 runs at 20.13. In 1914, he took 90 further wickets. In all, he took 199 wickets in his 50 first-class matches at a bowling average of 20.03. On 9 July 1914, Jeeves played for the Players against the Gentlemen at The Oval, assisting the Players to victory by taking 4-44 in the Gentlemen's second innings; Plum Warner predicted a bright future for him. Jeeves played his last first-class match on 27 August 1914 for Warwickshire against Surrey. Jeeves had played 2 first-class matches in 1912, 24 first-class matches in 1913, and 24 first- class matches in 1914.Halford (2013), pp. 175–176. In addition to playing cricket, Jeeves also played football and billiards.Halford (2013), p. 107. War service and death After the outbreak of the First World War and once the 1914 cricket season had finished, Jeeves volunteered for service in the army. He was among thousands of volunteers who assembled at Birmingham General Hospital to depart for army training on 10 October 1914. He became Private 611 Jeeves of the 2nd Birmingham Battalion, C Company. With the rest of the battalion, he began training on 13 October 1914. Jeeves would spend Christmas with his family in Goole for the last time in 1914.Halford (2013), p. 137–140. On the first day of 1915, the 2nd Battalion was renamed the 15th Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment. Training continued for the battalion for months and they were moved to different locations for various types of training. In mid-November, the whole battalion went home on a short leave, and then on 21 November 1915, they were deployed to France. C Company first went to the front lines on 22 December 1915.Halford (2013), pp. 141–149. On 22 July 1916, Private Jeeves (aged 28) was killed in action in France, at High Wood near Montauban-de-Picardie, during the Battle of the Somme. His body was never recovered and his name is carved on the Thiepval Memorial for soldiers with no known grave who died during the Battle of the Somme. His name is also inscribed on the Goole Cenotaph war memorial, among other names of casualties of the First World War.Halford (2013), p. 171. Inspiration for Wodehouse P. G. Wodehouse's fictional characters Bertie Wooster and his ingenious valet Jeeves have become famous since their 1915 debut short story (\\"Extricating Young Gussie\\"), with the character Jeeves first appearing in a major role in 1916 in his second appearance (in \\"Leave it to Jeeves\\"). Wodehouse named the fictional Jeeves after the cricketer Jeeves, according to the 1953 book Bring on the Girls!, a semi-autobiographical book co-written by Wodehouse and Guy Bolton. Quote: \\"For a long time I was stumped for a name, then I remembered a cricketer in the years before the war called Jeeves. Played for Gloucestershire, I think. Calling a character after a county cricketer is lucky. Sherlock and Holmes were both county cricketers. I believe Doyle had decided on Sherrinford Holmes, when he suddenly thought of Mordecai Sherlock [sic], who used to keep wicket for Yorkshire. Jeeves seemed to me just right for the sort of bloke I wanted.\\" [See Mordecai Sherwin.] In 1967, Rowland Ryder, son of the Warwickshire County Cricket Club secretary (also named Rowland Ryder) who had discovered Percy Jeeves at Hawes, wrote to Wodehouse asking if he named the character after Percy Jeeves of the Warwickshire County Cricket Club. Ryder shortly received a letter from Wodehouse in reply: > Yes, you are quite right. It must have been in 1913 that I paid a visit to > my parents in Cheltenham and went to see Warwickshire play Gloucestershire > on the Cheltenham College ground. I suppose Jeeves's bowling must have > impressed me, for I remembered him in 1916 when I was in New York and > starting the Jeeves and Bertie saga, and it was just the name I wanted. I > have always thought till lately that he was playing for Gloucestershire that > day. (I remember admiring his action very much.)Halford (2013), p. 99. After receiving Wodehouse's letter, Ryder sent Wodehouse a Warwickshire tie. Wodehouse replied with another letter gladly accepting the tie and wrote that it was \\"the only one I wear nowadays\\". Wodehouse wore the tie in photographs for a 1971 interview with Michael Davie in the colour supplement of The Observer. Davie commented the tie had been singed by Wodehouse's pipe; the Warwickshire CCC secretary, Leslie Deakins, sent Wodehouse another tie. According to Ryder, Wodehouse \\"had virtually become an honorary member of the club\\". The first letter from Wodehouse to Ryder is displayed in Warwickshire's Edgbaston museum. There is also a letter from Wodehouse to Deakins displayed at Edgbaston. Legacy The cricket ball with which Jeeves took seven wickets for 34 runs against Worcestershire in 1913 is displayed in the Edgbaston Cricket Ground pavilion. The match took place at Edgbaston.Halford (2013), pp. 92, 175. In April 2016, the centenary year of Jeeves's death, a blue plaque honouring Jeeves was unveiled in Goole, where Jeeves lived before he played cricket for Warwickshire. In July 2016, a memorial stone made to honour Jeeves was unveiled alongside a poplar tree planted in his honour at the Cheltenham College Ground, where P. G. Wodehouse saw Jeeves play in 1913. The tree was planted jointly by Jeeves’s great-nephew and Wodehouse’s grandson.

The foundations of the castle were laid 800 years ago by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. The most prosperous period Cēsis Castle experienced was during its next owners, the Teutonic Order. It became one of the key administrative and economic centers of the Teutonic Order in Livonia and was a seat of Landmeister in Livland. The first serious damage was done to the castle during the Livonian War, when it was besieged by the army of Ivan the Terrible. In the course of the siege of 1577 approximately 300 people within the castle committed mass suicide by blowing themselves up with gunpowder. Cēsis Castle was still in use during the following century but it fell into disuse after the Great Northern War. Today the castle is the most visited heritage site in Cēsis and one of the 'must see' destinations in the Baltic states. History = Foundation and expansion = In the autumn of 1206 during the Livonian Crusades, the Wends (a small tribe living on the site of the present day town of Cēsis) converted to Christianity and became allies of the crusaders. In 1208 the Brothers of the Militia of Christ, otherwise known as the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, took up residence among the Wends in their hillfort. They fortified the Wends' hillfort with a stone wall, largely replacing the previous timber defences. Although the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia describes the fort as “the smallest in Livonia”, it withstood repeated sieges by Estonians and Russians. In 1213 or 1214 the Livonian Brothers of the Sword started construction of the new stone castle right next to the Wend's hillfort. The design of this 13th century castle is unknown as all its structures (except the chapel) have been torn down in the course of the subsequent building phases. In 1237 Cēsis Castle was taken over by the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order. Under the new governor Cēsis Castle underwent large-scale reconstruction. The old fortifications were gradually replaced by a monumental square castle (castellum), consisting of four ranges built around a courtyard. This form of the Teutonic Order castle was imported from Prussia and largely stemmed from the need for “fortified convents” that would be easy to defend and where the brethren's domicile would be as compact as possible. To provide additional safety and accommodate various service buildings, outer baileys were built as part of the castle complex. As a result of the grandiose reconstruction Cēsis became one of the largest and mightiest castles of the Teutonic Order.Marienburg of the Livonian Branch of the Teutonic Order, and its magnificent ruins still testify to its importancealt=center = Time of greatest prosperity = The convent of Cēsis Castle was under the charge of a high-ranking Teutonic Knight – commander or Komtur. The Komtur was responsible for adequate supply of the brethren with food and armament, for order and discipline in the castle and for the collection of dues within the castle's district – Komturei. At the beginning of the 15th century Cēsis Castle and Komturei came under the direct rule of the Order's supreme commander in Livonia, becoming part of the-so- called Livonian Master's district. However, for most of their time the Livonian Masters resided in Rīga Castle, but in periods of danger and instability they moved to Cēsis. Finally, at the end of the 15th century, the Order's administrative headquarters were relocated from Rīga to Cēsis, and Cēsis Castle became the permanent residence of the Masters. Artist's view of Cēsis Castle as it may have appeared in the mid-16th century As the residency of the Livonian Master and the meeting place of the Order's highest officials in Livonia Cēsis Castle witnessed many events of great significance for the history of Livonia. Here envoys were received, issues of war and peace decided and it was here that the Order's troops assembled for military action when such need arose. The castle also housed the Order's archives and library as well as a chancery with a scriptorium. The period from 1494 to 1535, when the Livonian branch of the Order was led by Wolter von Plettenberg – one of the greatest politicians and military commanders in Livonia's history – is traditionally considered as the time of the greatest flourishing of Cēsis Castle. Under von Plettenberg Cēsis Castle underwent large-scale reconstruction. The castle's fortifications were reinforced with three artillery towers, while some of castle's interiors (e.g. the Chapter Hall and the Master's Chamber) underwent major remodelling. Resplendent Master's Chamber brick vaulting from c.1500 survives up to now. = Siege and explosion = The ongoing development of Cēsis Castle was interrupted by the dissolution of the Teutonic Order's Livonian branch in 1561 and by devastating sieges of the castle that took place during the Livonian War. In 1577, when the castle was besieged and bombarded for five days by the army of Ivan the Terrible, 300 hundred people within the castle, realizing that it will be impossible to defend themselves any longer, made the decision to commit a mass suicide by blowing themselves up with four barrels of gunpowder. In 1974 archaeologists unearthed two basement rooms, which had remained over from the castle's western range – the part of the castle that collapsed as a result of explosion. On the basement floor under the collapsed ceiling beams a number of human remains of adults and children were uncovered, all securely dated by coins to 1577, Chronicler Salomon Henning reports that 'all were blown up, aside from those who were hiding elsewhere in the castle' and it is likely that human remains recovered by archaeologists belonged to those who were trying to avoid the explosion. = Gradual neglect and decay = After the Polish-Swedish War Cēsis Castle came under the rule of Sweden and it was handed over to Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna. The castle was the property of the Oxenstiernas until 1681 when it came under the direct ownership of the King of Sweden. Soon after Cēsis became a crown property, soldiers of a mounted unit were stationed there. They are reported to have demolished the castle so badly that it “looked like it had been pillaged—the doors, cupboards and windows were broken, the iron parts were removed, all hinges and locks from the doors were gone and the stoves had been partially torn down”. Another document mentions that soldiers broke down the doors and floors for firewood and even took the window lead cames to melt them down for musket balls. In the first years of the Great Northern War the Russian troops continued demolishing Cēsis Castle. Rain and frost destroyed the old fortress even further, gradually but inevitably eroding the roofless masonry walls. The ceilings and stone vaults, saturated with rainwater, collapsed, plastering came off the wet walls and the mortar that kept stones together, crumbled away under the impact of frost. The castle gradually ‘buried itself’ in rubble. The only part of the castle that undergone major renovation was the former gatehouse of the outer bailey. In 1760s it was rebuilt as a manor house, the so-called New Castle. = Picturesque ruins = Cēsis Castle in 1842 In 1830s, the owner of Cēsis Castle estate Count Karl Gustav von Sievers ordered “the damp spot by the ruins” to be transformed into a spacious landscape park. The imposing silhouette of the ruined castle became an ornamental feature of the park and the reflection of the castle in the mirror of the pond added to its romantic atmosphere. The park served as a promenade and pleasure-ground not only for the von Sievers family and their guests but also for the patients of the water-cure establishment that Karl Gustav opened in 1841. Caring for visitor's comfort and safety even repair works were undertaken in some parts of the castle. In 1903 members of the Society for the History and Antiquities of Rīga initiated campaign to save the Western Tower of the castle for future generations. Under the impact of rain and frost the tower's upper floor brick vault was in danger of collapse and therefore could bring down the outstanding 500-year-old vaulting of the Master's Chamber. In 1904 a temporary covering was set up but 10 year later, just before the outbreak of the First World War, the tower was crowned by a solid conical roof. After the war the newly-founded state of Latvia expropriated the largest part of Cēsis Castle manor from the Count von Sievers’ family. The manor house was placed at the disposal of the Army of Latvia but the ruins of the castle were granted on lease to the Town Council of Cēsis. In 1925 the Monuments Authority of Latvia listed the castle as a nationally important historic building. However, major conservation and refurbishment works within the site were undertaken starting from 1930s when it became popular as a tourist attraction. = Witness of the grim past = During the authoritarian regime of Kārlis Ulmanis in the canon of national values there was no place for medieval castles, which were regarded as a symbol of German rule. However, in spite of the calls “to remove the old piles of stone from the hills of our fatherland”, Cēsis municipality did not withdraw its care for the centuries-old castle. Mayor of the town Rūdolfs Kaucis is reported to have said in public: “Some people recommend tearing down everything that reminds us of the knights’ time. I would like to object by insisting that we cannot escape our own history. Those who once lived in this castle, have long since perished, but the Latvians, whose ancestors once built this castle, are now a free nation. The castle walls remind us that united the Latvian people are invincible.” The official attitude of the Soviet occupation regime towards medieval heritage was thoroughly negative. Suffice to mention the blowing up of Königsberg Castle in 1968 with the aim of 'erasing the symbol of Prussian militarism and fascism from the memory of Soviet citizens'. However, in Cēsis the castle ruins successfully survived this politically unfavourable period and remained a popular tourist destination. In 1950s large-scale repair works were undertaken while the castle's former outer bailey acquired a peculiar function: it served as a sports ground of local trade school. The former students still remember that it contained running tracks, basketball and volleyball courts as well as sections for long jump and shot-put. Moreover, the administration of the trade school planned large-scale renovation of the sports ground that entailed the building of stands with 600 spectator seats, a tennis court, a swimming pool and a shooting range. Cēsis Castle was saved from this ill-judged project by lack of financing and objections from the part of the Ministry of Culture.  Archaeology  In 1974 archaeologists in Cēsis Castle unearthed remains of the building where explosion of 1577 took place. This unique archaeological discovery stimulated further research. In the course of more than 30 excavation seasons almost 10 000 m² of the castle was researched. As a result of the large-scale excavations Cēsis Castle has become archaeologically the most studied, and with the richest finds, of any medieval castle in Latvia. The largest part of the total of 13 000 artefacts found during the excavations in the castle are now kept in the National History Museum of Latvia, but as of 2004 such finds become part of the collection of Cēsis Museum. The future priorities are no longer related to large-scale excavations in the castle but rather to adequate preservation and research of the obtained archaeological material and elaboration of publications.  Architecture  Architectural analysis of Cēsis Castle has indicated that there were three major building phases to the castle. (1) During the first half of the 13th century, a stone chapel and chapter-house, together with other buildings (presumably constructed out of timber), were built on the site of the current castle by the Brothers of the Sword. Situated in the eastern corner of the convent castle, a chapel with Romanesque corbels is one of few surviving parts of this earliest phase of construction. (2) In the late 14th century Teutonic Knights begun the transformation of the building into a convent-type castle with four ranges grouped round a quadrangle providing all the functional facilities needed by militant religious community – chapel, refectory, dormitories, chapter-house, kitchen and services. (3) With the development of firearms, the castle's fortifications were gradually modified to resist artillery. Three round towers were built c.1500 – one in the northern corner of the convent castle and two in the outer baileys. At the same time the room on the first floor of the west tower – the Master's Chamber – was lavishly decorated with impressive brick vault and painted plasterwork.  In Literature  Cēsis Castle and its relationship to literature can be found in several Eastern European examples, most notably in Alexander Bestuzhev's short-story \\"Castle Wenden\\" (Wenden is German for Cēsis). In the story, Bestuzhev attempted to create a Gothic tale that is likely to have functioned as a partially political commentary on the state of Russian politics, due to his connection with the Decembrists. In the story, the castle plays a central role as the backdrop to a fictionalized account of the death of Wenno, the first Master of the Livonian Knights, a historical event still much debated in medieval studies. The story is in the Gothic tradition of The Castle of Otranto, while making ties to Russia's history in Latvia.Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, Alexander, \\"Замок Венден\\", 1821, from Александр Александрович Бестужев-Марлинский: СОЧИНЕНИЯ В ДВУХ ТОМАХ, Том первый.  Today  Cēsis Castle is open to the public year-round and according to figures released by Cēsis Culture and Tourism Centre, 100 000 people visited the castle in 2016. The main site of interest in the castle – the Western Tower – lures the visitors not only with the Master's Chamber, but also with the possibility to get a bird's eye view of the surroundings. The loft windows open to the scenery of the environs of Cēsis in all its glory. Each visitor is given a candle lantern to explore the dimly lit Western Tower. It is a tradition that originated in 1996 and has become a trademark of Cēsis Castle. The castle is not only a tourist attraction but also a habitat of various species of plants and animals. Naturalists have drawn special attention to bats, which hibernate i the basements of the castle. When frost sets in, five different species of bats settle in wall cavities and stay there throughout the winter. Throughout the summer season there are artisan workshops located in the outer bailey of the castle where bone and antler craftsman, woodturner, blacksmith and printmaker work. They practice their craft by utilising the same methods as were common in the Middle Ages. Adjacent to artisan workshops a 16th-century kitchen garden is recreated. The garden contains vegetables, herbs and medicinal plants that were cultivated in Livonia, 500 years ago. As with artisans, it is possible to meet a gardener every day during the summer season.

It is referred sometimes to as \\"summer wound\\" (German Sommerwunden). Beginning nodule on neck Operated large lesions in the inner face of the carpus, with typical pus \\"rollers\\" It is caused by infestation with the nematode Parafilaria bovicola. Transmission involves fly vectors of the genus Musca, which ingest microfilariae when feeding on the skin lesions. Johannes Kaufmann, Parasitic infections of domestic animals, Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, , p. 106-107. The disease has been reported in Bulgaria, France, Germany, Morocco, Sweden, Tunisia, and especially South Africa. In Germany, the nodules are known to develop on the upper side on the body. In Morocco, the haemorrhagic lesions are mainly seen on the belly, neck and forelimbs, where it can lead to a wide plages of subcutaneous necrosis, with swelling of the arm. Ivermectin is efficient for individual treatments of the illness. But surgical excision, although very haemorrhagic, is far more efficient. A similar disease, sometimes referred to as Cascado, occurs in Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia) and is caused by Stephanofilaria species.  Epidemiology  Epidemiology differs among the countries in which it has been reported, and is dependent upon temperature and rainfall patterns, and the subsequent multiplication of the fly vectors. In Germany, the verminous nodules start in May and June, 2 to 4 weeks after the beginning of pasture feeding. They heal spontaneously in October and November. Gustav Rosenberger, Krankheiten des Rindes, Verlag Paul Parey, Berlin, . p. 912-913 In Morocco, the disease is observed in years when heavy rainfalls occur in March and April. Numerous cases are then observed in April and May, in the immediate surroundings of the ponds. Some cases will heal spontaneously, but some others lead to wide subcutaneous lesions which require a veterinary treatment. The repartition and gravity of the skin lesions suggests that the causative agent may be slightly different from the one observed in Western Europe.

His interest in his wife is rekindled when he sees Giuliana's happiness after she has begun a love affair with a novelist, Filippo d'Arborio. She becomes pregnant by d'Arborio. Tullio urges an abortion but she refuses; d'Arborio then dies of a tropical infection. Tullio cannot tolerate the healthy male child delivered to Giuliana, although he tries. While the family are at Christmas mass he exposes the baby and it dies, apparently of natural causes. Giuliana, who knows Tullio has murdered the baby, leaves him.

Use Network operators want to use the allocated spectrum as efficiently as possible and to the highest possible capacity, to maximise the return from the investment into the licence for it. The ideal frequency reuse is one, meaning that each cell can operate at the same frequency. This in turn creates interference to users operating in nearby places. Increase Interference causes voice quality to drop and may cause call drop. It is possible to cancel the interference at the mobile handset side by changing the baseband software without changing anything at the network side. SAIC-enabled mobiles can work at high levels of interference, and need less transmit power from the network, which in turn reduces interference in the network. Studies shows that the speech quality gain can be about 6% at a SAIC mobiles penetration of 10%, about 37% at a SAIC mobile penetration of 50%, and about 99% at a SAIC mobiles penetration of 100%.

This plant, with showy summer-blooming pink to lavender flowers, is often used as a honey plant, medicinal plant, and garden ornamental. The species is quite variable, and several subspecies or varieties have been recognized within it. Description and distribution Monarda fistulosa (wild bergamot) plants, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada Monarda fistulosa is an herbaceous perennial that grows from slender creeping rhizomes, thus commonly occurring in large clumps. The plants are typically up to 3 ft (0.9 m) tall, with a few erect branches. Its leaves are about 2-3 in (5–8 cm) long, lance-shaped, and toothed. Its compact flower clusters are solitary at the ends of branches. Each cluster is about 1.5 in (4 cm) long, containing about 20-50 flowers. Wild bergamot often grows in rich soils in dry fields, thickets, and clearings, usually on limy soil. The plants generally flower from June to September.Dickinson T, Metsger D, Bull J, Dickinson R. (2004) The ROM Field Guide to Wildflowers of Ontario, Toronto:ROM Museum, p. 293. Monarda fistulosa ranges from Quebec to the Northwest Territories and British Columbia, south to Georgia, Texas, Arizona, Idaho, and northeastern Washington. The plant is noted for its fragrance, and is a source of oil of thyme. Taxonomy Several varieties have been variously recognized within Monarda fistulosa, of which some have also been treated as subspecies or as distinct species. Some of the varieties are geographically widespread, and others are quite restricted in their ranges. Varieties include: * Monarda fistulosa var. brevisThis taxon is sometimes referred to as Monarda fistulosa subsp. brevis; however, as of September 2011, that nomenclatural combination has not yet been validly published. - Smoke Hole bergamot (Virginia and West Virginia) * Monarda fistulosa var. fistulosa - wild bergamot (widespread, primarily eastern and central North America) * Monarda fistulosa var. longipetiolata - (Ontario and Quebec) * Monarda fistulosa var. maheuxii - (Ontario) * Monarda fistulosa var. menthifolia - (widespread, western North America, excluding Oregon and California) * Monarda fistulosa var. mollis - (widespread, primarily eastern and central North America) * Monarda fistulosa var. rubra - (eastern North America, uncommon) * Monarda fistulosa, unnamed varietyThis taxon is sometimes referred to as Monarda fistulosa var. stipitatoglandulosa; however, as of September 2011, that nomenclatural combination has not yet been validly published. The synonymous name Monarda stipitatoglandulosa is validly published. - (Arkansas and Oklahoma) One authority states that Native Americans recognized four kinds of wild bergamot that had different odors.(Wood,1997) Conservation status in the United States It is listed as historical in Rhode Island. As a weed It is listed as weed in Nebraska. Uses Wild bergamot was considered a medicinal plant by many Native Americans including the Menominee, the Ojibwe, and the Winnebago (Ho-Chunk). It was used most commonly to treat colds, and was frequently made into a tea. Today, many families still use wild bergamot during the cold and flu season. The tea may be sweetened with honey, as it tends to be quite strong.Wild Bergamot, USDA The species of Monarda that may go under the common name \\"bee balm,\\" including M. fistulosa, have a long history of use as a medicinal plant by Native Americans, including the Blackfoot. The Blackfoot recognized the plant's strong antiseptic action, and used poultices of the plant for skin infections and minor wounds. A tea made from the plant was also used to treat mouth and throat infections caused by dental caries and gingivitis. Bee balm is the natural source of the antiseptic thymol, the primary active ingredient in modern commercial mouthwash formulas. The Winnebago used a tea made from bee balm as a general stimulant. Bee balm was also used as a carminative herb by Native Americans to treat excessive flatulence.Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L. Tilford, Leaves were eaten boiled with meat and a concoction of the plant was made into hair pomade. The herb is considered an active diaphoretic (sweat inducer). The essential oil of Monarda fistulosa was analyzed using mass spectrometry and arithmetical retention indices, and was found to contain p-cymene (32.5%), carvacrol (24.0%), thymol (12.6%), an aliphatic aldehyde (6.3%), the methyl ether of carvacrol (5.5%), α-pinene (3.5%), β-pinene (2.9%), sabinene hydrate (1.9%), α-terpinene (1.7%), citronellyl acetate (1.6%), and β-caryophyllene (1.1%).

They are woody perennials usually occurring as aerial parasites, are pollinated by hummingbirds and flowerpiercers, with seed-dispersal generally by birds but occasionally by mammals (Dromiciops). The genus is distinguished from other New World Loranthaceae by its simple, terminal, racemose inflorescences, together with its of 4- or 5-merous flowers, versatile anthers, and the presence of endosperm. Further differences include fused cotyledons and the absence of epicortical roots. Tristerix pubescens Phylogeny Tristerix was first described in 1830 by Martius, who published three species: T. viridiflorus (now Macrosolen viridiflorus, T. tetrandus (now T. corymbosus) and T. reinwardtianus (now Macrosolen avenis). In 1868, Eichler placed Loranthus aphyllus and L. tetrandrus in the genus Phrygillanthus. However, in 1973, Barlow & Wiens recognised these two Phrygilanthus species as Tristerix aphyllus and T. corymbosus, respectively, returning Tristerix to use. Martius described the genus as having three bracts. However, this characteristic applies to only two species of the genus (T. aphyllus and T. corymbosus). In these, two bracteoles inside a primary bract lie below the ovary. The other members of the genus have no bracteoles. Van Tieghem (1895) divided the genus into two subgenera; those species without bracteoles - Metastachys (with 9 species), and those with bracteoles - Tristerix (with 2 species - T. aphyllus and T. corymbosus). This division is accepted by Kuijt. A phylogenetic study of 10 Tristerix species by Amico et al. (2007) found evidence for three groupings. A simplified consensus cladogram of their conclusions, from analyses which used two different character sets and three methods (maximum likelihood, minimum parsimony, and Bayesian inference) for finding the tree, is given below. Note that the grouping of the Tristerix species with bracteoles remains. See Tristerix corymbosus References External links  * Govaerts, R. et al. 2018.

It is the twelfth track from their debut album, Palabas. It reached and became #1 in Filipino music charts. It is also the theme song of the Filipino version (Metropolitan Theater Guild) of William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, as seen in its music video. The song was nominated for Song of the Year in the 2006 MYX Music Awards. The song begins with metronome by drummer Chris Cantada, then goes to the verse. During the verse, its signature mellow guitar riff is played by lead guitarist Erwin Armovit. This continues until the end of the first chorus. Then, in the second verse, both guitars become heavily distorted, however, in the second chorus, it settles back to its original slow and mellow style. The instrumental segment of the song is then played, until it finally fades out. Music video The music video was directed by Marie Jamora and produced by Steven Uy. It shows Romeo, played by Yan Yuzon (brother of Sponge Cola frontman and lead singer Yael Yuzon); Juliet, played by Ina Feleo (daughter of actor Johnny Delgado and director Laurice Guillen), and the narrator played by Ricky Abad. The music video was entirely shot in the Henry Lee Irwin Theatre, Ateneo de Manila University. Like the original Romeo & Juliet, it shows the story between Juliet and his Romeo, and features its original quotes and catchphrases. The band is playing in a theater, but not in the same place where Yan Yuzon and Ina Feleo are performing. The video was soon nominated for Favorite Music Video in the 2006 MYX Music Awards, but it lost to Rivermaya's \\"You'll Be Safe Here\\". Versions The song has two versions: version one is the version used in the music video, and version two being the album version. Some differences are the intro and outro - version one begins with a melodic piano piece, followed by the song, then an outro riff that is different from the album version.

It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2000 for its architecture. Overview Kentuck Knob is a one-story, 2,300 square foot dwelling situated on Chestnut Ridge, the western-most ridge of Pennsylvania's Allegheny Mountains. The house stands at the end of a driveway south of Pennsylvania State Route 2010. The home is recessed into the southern side of Kentuck Knob's peak with a mountainous surrounding it that originally composed a farm. The Hagans, I.N. and Bernardine, planted much of the hilltop property with tree seedlings to provide both privacy and a wind break. The mountain summit offers a sweeping view of the Youghiogheny River gorge as well as surrounding hills and farmland. The house is only four miles south of Wright's most famous house, Fallingwater (1935), also in Pennsylvania's Laurel Highlands region. Skylights on the exterior porch of Kentuck Knob showing Wright's usage of red cypress Description Wright employed tidewater red cypress, glass, and native sandstone to build the home, and capped it with a copper roof at a cost of $96,000. At 86, and hard at work on the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Beth Sholom Synagogue in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, and about 12 residential homes, Wright said he could \\"shake it (Kentuck Knob) out of his sleeve at will\\", never even setting foot on the site, except for a short visit during the construction phase. This was one of the last homes to be completed by Wright. The crescent-shaped house curls around a west-facing courtyard, blending into the contours of the land. The anchor of the design is a hexagonal stone core that rises from the hipped roof at the intersection of the living and bedroom wings. The walls of the flat-roofed carport and studio burrow into the knob and define the courtyard's eastern side. A stone planter terminates the low retaining wall on the west side of the courtyard, and it features a copper light fixture accented with a triangular-shaped shade. To the south, the house extends beyond the hillside on 10\\" thick stone-faced concrete ramparts. As with other houses Wright designed during this period, the Kentuck Knob plan is based upon a module system, in this case an equilateral triangle measuring 4'-6\\" to a side creating an outside 240° L-plan house. Kentuck Knob blending into surroundings \\"FLW\\" signature at Kentuck Knob Forgoing the site's uppermost location and its commanding views, Wright characteristically chose a challenging and less obvious site immediately south of the site's hilltop, nestling the house into the hillside (allowing the building to grow out of rather than dominate its setting) and orienting the house to the south and west for optimal solar exposure. History The Hagan House began in 1953 when the Hagans, owners of a major dairy company in Western Pennsylvania (Hagan Ice Cream, now owned by Kemps), purchased of mountain land east of their native Uniontown, the county seat. As friends of the Kaufmanns, owners of nearby Fallingwater on Bear Run, the Hagans asked their architect Frank Lloyd Wright, then 86 years old, to design a deluxe Usonian home for them. The house was completed in 1956, and the Hagans lived at Kentuck Knob for almost 30 years. In 1986, Lord Palumbo of London, UK, bought the property for $600,000 as a vacation home. Since 1996, the Palumbo family has balanced their occupancy with a public tour program, a method of historic property management more common to their native Britain than to the United States. The Palumbos added a sculpture meadow to the site near the base of the mountain, where 35 sculptures by artists such as Andy Goldsworthy, Harry Bertoia, Claes Oldenburg, Ray Smith, Michael Warren, Katherine Gili and Sir Anthony Caro are displayed. Found object art pieces include a French pissoir, red British telephone boxes, and a large, vertically upright concrete slab from the Berlin Wall. The meadow is reached by a walking path through woods from either the house or the visitors center. The name Kentuck Knob is credited to the late 18th-century settler David Askins, who intended to move from Western Pennsylvania to Kentucky, but then reconsidered and remained at this very property, naming his tract of land Little Kentuck. It subsequently became known as the Kentuck District of Stewart Township, one of the county's several rural mountainous townships. Ever since, the summit of the property has been called Kentuck Knob.

Consequently, McHugh became with George Lambert the best pace attack Gloucestershire – a county known for half a century for its near-exclusive reliance on spin bowling – had fielded to that point in the twentieth century. In 1954 he took ninety-two wickets for exactly twenty runs each, and in 1955 did almost as well with over seventy-five wickets, whilst in 1956 his average fell further to only nineteen runs a wicket. McHugh's batting was consistently inept.

Located about one and a half miles west of Atherstone, it is the site of a medieval Cistercian Abbey (founded in 1148) and Merevale Hall (built in 1840 and home to the Dugdale family). History =Merevale Abbey= An abbey was built in Merevale in 1148 by Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Earl of Derby. It was a relatively small abbey with only around 10 monks. The abbey was dissolved in October 1538, during the reign of Henry VIII and fell into ruin, but traces of it remain to the present day. One of the most significant parts to have survived is the gate chapel, now used as the parish church. The church is significant for its Cistercian stained glass, including its Jesse window (one of the most important in the British Isles), and for being the only Cistercian gate chapel to be open for regular weekly services throughout the year. William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby is buried here.  Merevale Hall  Designed by Edward Blore, Merevale Hall was completed in 1840 and has been the home of the descendants of Sir William Dugdale since this time. Dugdale was a strong royalist supporter of King Charles I during the English Civil War, and was appointed as his 'Garter Principal King of Arms'.

The Ardiaei were an Illyrian people residing on territory of present-day Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina between Adriatic coast on the south, Konjic on the north, along the Neretva river and its right bank on the west, extending to Lake Shkodra to the southeast. From the 3rd century BC to 168 BC the capital cities of the Ardiaean State were Rhizon and Scodra. The Ardiaean kingdom was transformed into a formidable power—both by land and sea—under the leadership of Agron. During this time, Agron invaded part of Epirus, Corcyra, Epidamnos and Pharos in succession, establishing garrisons in them. The Ardiaean realm became one of Rome's major enemies, and the primary threat in the Adriatic Sea. A series of wars were fought between the Roman Republic and the Illyrian (Ardiaean-Labaeatan) kingdom in the 3rd–2nd centuries BC. Polybius (203 BC–120 BC) writes that they were subduedPlb. 2.11, \\"The Romans, taking the Epidamnians under their protection, advanced into the interior of Illyricum, subduing the Ardiaei as they went.\\" by the Romans at events that occurred at 229 BC. The Epitome of Livy reports that Roman consul Fulvius Flaccus put down an uprising in 135 BC undertaken by Ardiaei and Pleraei in Roman Illyria.vardaei-geo In earlier times the Ardiaei were enemies of the Autariatae for a long period over salt source. Appian (95–165) writes that the Ardiaei were destroyed by the Autariatae and that in contrast to the Autariatae they had maritime power.App. Ill. 1, \\"In like manner the Ardiæi, who were distinguished for their maritime power, were finally destroyed by the Autarienses, whose land forces were stronger, but whom they had often defeated.\\" Name The Ardiaei are attested since the 3rd century BC. They often appears in ancient accounts describing the Illyrian Wars and Macedonian Wars. Their name was written in Ancient Greek as Ἀρδιαῖοι, Ardiaioi, or Οὐαρδαῖοι, Ouardaioi, and in Latin as Vardiaei or Vardaei. The tribal name Ardiaei may be related to the Latin ardea meaning \\"heron\\", a symbol of animal totemism. Original location Accounts in ancient sources create much confusion about the location of the Ardiaean original homeland. They were located in the area of southern Illyria, somewhere in present-day Montenegro, most likely around the gulf of Rhizon, although Strabo places them in the right bank of the Neretva. Their initial inland residence was located along the Naro River up to the Konjic region, in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. The name of the town Čapljina is another feature suggesting that the original homeland of Ardiaei might indeed have been the Neretva valley region. Specifically, there is a town in Bosnia and Herzegovina situated in the wider Neretva valley region (the original homeland of ancient Illyrian people of Ardiaei), called Čapljina, and its name derives from čaplja, which in modern Bosnian language means 'heron'. The Latin word for heron is ardea, a word that bears striking similarity with the name of Ardiaei, and should not be excluded altogether as its potential cognate. This hypothesis opens up many possibilities for the interpretation of the original homeland of the Ardiaei and the etymology of their name. For example, heron might have had totemic pagan value among the Illyrians inhabiting that region, due to its presence in this area, and it is not implausible to conclude that one of those Illyrian peoples named itself after a heron, the Ardiaei. The Latin word ardea might be a Latin translation of some original Illyrian word for 'heron' that Romans found when they settled in this area, or the 'ardea' itself could have been an Illyrian word taken by Romans, who might have slightly altered it and integrated it into their language, Latin. Indeed, the word Ardiaei is found in ancient Greek sources predating the arrival of Romans and their language to the Illyrian lands. It is also possible that ancient Illyrians or Romans named this place the place of heron(s), and the Slavic settlers, who settled in the former Illyrian lands around 6th century A.D. translated the name of this place into their language(s), which in turn gave Čapljina, \\"the place of heron(s)\\".Adzanela (Axhanela) Ardian, Illyrian Bosnia and Herzegovina-an overview of a cultural legacy, 2004, Centre for Balkan Studies, Online Balkan Centre : https://www.academia.edu/2490281/Illyrian_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina- an_Overview_of_a_Cultural_Legacy_Ancient_Illyrians_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina History Due to widespread piracy perpetrated in the Adriatic by the Ardiaei and other Illyrian tribes, the Romans campaigned against them in the events of the Illyrian Wars. They were viewed as heavy drinkers in comparison, by the Greeks. In earlier times the Ardiaei were enemies of the Autariatae for a long period over salt source. The Ardiaei had briefly attained military might, during 230 B.C. under the reign of king Agron (an Ardiaean by tribal origin). His widow, Queen Teuta attempted to gain a foothold in the Adriatic but failed due to Roman intervention. Historic accounts hold that King Agron was hiredThe Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 7, Part 1, by Frank William Walbank, 1984, , page 452 by king Demetrius of Macedonia repel the invasion of Macedonia by the invading Aetolians. The Ardiaei had 20 decuriae. The ancient geographer, Strabo, lists the Ardiaei as one of the three strongest Illyrian peoples – the other two being the Autariatae and the Dardani. Strabo writes;Strab. 7.5 King Agron, son of Pleuratus who belonged to the ruling house of the Ardiaei, disposed of the most powerful force, both by land and sea, of any of the kings which had reigned in Illyria before him. Ardiaean dynasty The following is a reconstruction of the Ardiaean dynasty by N. G. L. Hammond (1966): *Pleuratus I ( 340 BC), fought against Philip II probably in 344/343 BC () ( 310 BC) *Pleuratus II ( 280 BC)  Agron ( 250 BC, died 230 BC), husband of Teuta *Pinnes ( 220 BC)  Scerdilaidas ( 250 BC) *Pleuratus III ( 220 BC) Genthius ( 190 BC, captured in 168 BC) * *Pleuratus IV ( 160 BC) * *Plator ( 160 BC) The branch of Scerdilaidas is generally considered a Labeatan dynasty, that emerged after the fall of Agron and Teuta.

Early life Gay was born in Hohenwald, Tennessee. After high school, Gay joined the United States Navy and served during the Vietnam War. After returning to the States, he lived in both New York City and Chicago before returning to Lewis County, Tennessee, where he lived from 1978 until his death. Even though he had been writing since the age of fifteen, Gay did not publish anything until 1998, when two of his short stories were accepted by literary magazines. Before then, Gay made his living as a carpenter, drywall hanger, and house painter.J.M. White, \\"Afterword,\\" Wittgenstein's Lolita/The Iceman. (Brush Creek, TN: Wild Dog Press, 2006), pp. 60-62. Career In 1999, Gay published his first novel, The Long Home. Gay was recognized and marketed as \\"the real thing,\\" a new Larry Brown.See, for instance Tony Earley's review \\"Mephisto Tennessee Waltz,\\" The New York Times (November 21, 1999): Sec. 7, p. 12. The novel won the 1999 James A. Michener Memorial Prize and sold well enough to start a bidding war for his second novel. Provinces of Night was published in late 2000 and confirmed Gay's knack for storytelling. It formed the basis for the 2010 independent film Bloodworth. In 2002, Gay published a collection of stories, I Hate to See That Evening Sun Go Down, and in 2006 Gay's third novel, Twilight was published. With its story of a kinky undertaker who hires a hitman to kill a nosy teenager, Twilight is Gay's most straightforward Southern Gothic novel. Gay's stories have been anthologized extensively, and as well as his fictional work, Gay frequently contributed essays on music to magazines such as Paste and Oxford American. William Gay was named a 2007 USA Ford Foundation Fellow and awarded a $50,000 grant by United States Artists, a public charity that supports and promotes the work of American artists. =Lost works= In 2015, it was announced that two of his lost novels had been found and would be published: Little Sister Death was published in the autumn of 2015, and The Lost Country was published in late 2016. Editing is being done on another novel titled Stoneburner.PAUL NITSCHE - William Gay Archive Themes Gay's fiction is almost always set in the rural South of the 1940s and 50s. This alone lends it an air of old-fashioned authenticity similar to that of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. Gay's South is as darkly violent and as dirt- poor as anything by Erskine Caldwell or O'Connor. Gay's novels take the shape of coming-of-age stories. His three novels depict young idealistic boys that turn into men through a series of violent encounters in which they must make tough moral decisions to face and defeat the evil they are up against. Another recurrent theme in Gay's fiction is his preoccupation with \\"plain folk,\\" such as carpenters and bootleggers, who are frequently the kin of the young men coming of age. In addition, Provinces of Night deals with another issue peculiar to the Upper South of the period, the condemnation of private property for the development of a new dam by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Death He died on February 23, 2012, presumably of a heart attack. He was 70.

The latter were primarily involved in business activities and were allowed to own property. Nadītu were mainly particular women not living in the patriarchal family relations that Babylonian society regarded as normal. Nadītu lived in monastic buildings, but in general did own their home within these complexes, and were independent. They could engage in contracts, borrow money and perform other business transactions normally denied to women; records show that they were very active. Usually these women were part of the elite, often from royal families.Elisabeth Meier Tetlow (2004), Women, Crime and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society: Volume 1, p. 80-85 Their financial independence was based on their dowry, which they were not allowed to pass on to a man; the dowry was the compensation for not being included in the inheritance, as this was passed on through the patriarchal line. It is not exactly clear whether the nadītu were allowed to marry, or whether this right was only reserved for the nadītu that belonged to the Marduk temple. According to some sources celibacy was required in the Shamash temples, or at the least they had to remain childless, which is reflected in the meaning of the word nadītu - the fallow. When the nadītu died, the dowry fell to her brothers or other relatives. There were a lot of writers among the nadītu. According to the epic of Gilgamesh, writing is attributed to a goddess. In the temple of Inanna in Erech the earliest writing tablets are found, dating back to the 4th millennium BC. Many nadītu lived there as priestess. Along the rivers Tigris and Euphrates many temples are still found in worship of Inanna and where these nadītu resided in active service. The 5000-year-old temple in Uruk (biblical Erech) is the largest of these, being regularly rebuilt and expanded. A sculpture of a woman's head and the well-known Warka Vase (now in the museum of Baghdad) have been discovered there, showing reliefs of archaic Mother goddess culture: images of sacred properties and forests, men harvesting produce and goats indicating the symbols of social order of that time.

This immobilises the air within the cavity (air is still the actual insulator), preventing convection, and can substantially reduce space heating costs. A wall that has had cavity wall insulation installed (after construction), with refilled holes highlighted with arrows During construction of new buildings, cavities are often filled with glass fiber wool or rock wool panels placed between the two leaves (sides) of the wall, but many other building insulation materials offer various advantages and many others are also widely used. For existing buildings that were not built with insulated cavities, a fibrous material, polystyrene beads, or sometimes polyurethane foam can be installed in the cavity to reduce heat loss. The fibrous material often is cellulose insulation or glass wool blown into the cavity through suitably drilled holes until it fills the entire wall space. Although some foams used in the past, such as urea-formaldehyde, are no longer used (some people are allergic to this material, which is very difficult to remove once inside the wall), others, such as polyurethane, have taken their place. Cavity wall insulation also helps to prevent convection and can keep a house warm by making sure that less heat is lost through walls; this can also thus be a more cost-efficient way of heating one's house. About a third of the heat lost in an uninsulated home escapes through its walls.  Cavity wall insulation in the United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, grants from the government and from energy companies are widely available to help with the cost of cavity wall insulation. The Affordable Warmth Objective (HHCRO) provides help for low income and vulnerable households to improve the energy efficiency of their properties and reduce heating bills. A large number of properties that had the insulation installed by successive UK government-backed schemes were installed incorrectly or were unsuitable for the property. Incorrectly installed cavity wall insulation (CWI) causes water to seep into a properties walls, causing structural problems and damp patches that may also manifest into mould. In some cases, the damp and mould resulting from CWI can cause health problems or exacerbate existing conditions, particularly respiratory conditions. This has led to the formation of the Cavity Wall Insulation Victims Alliance (CWIVA). On 3 February 2015 the CWIVA took the debate to the houses of parliament discussing the cavity wall insulation industry.

Some writers place his birth in 1598, others in 1587 or in 1588. It is certain that he studied at Perugia. At the age of twenty he was a doctor of civil and canon law; at twenty-two, secretary of the Congregation of the Council. He held this office for fifteen years. He fulfilled the same functions in several other Roman Congregations. It is not certain that he ever lectured on canon law at the Roman University (Sapienza). He became blind at the age of forty-four. This affliction did not prevent him from devoting himself to canonical studies and from writing a commentary of the Decretals of Gregory IX, which gained for him the title of \\"Doctor Caecus Oculatissimus\\", i.e. the blind yet most far-sighted doctor. This commentary includes interpretations of the texts of the most difficult of the Decretals of Gregory IX. It is distinguished by the clearness with which the most complex and disputed questions of canon law are explained. The work is also of value for the purpose of ascertaining the practice of the Roman Congregations, especially that of the Congregation of the Council, of which the author quotes numerous decisions. Pope Benedict XIV gave this work the highest praise, and its authority is still continually appealed to in the Roman Congregations. It is divided, like the Decretals of Gregory IX, into five books. The first edition was published at Rome, in 1661, under the title of \\"Jus canonicum seu commentaria absolutissima in quinque libros Decretalium\\". It has been reprinted several times. Fagnani is reproached with excessive rigour in his commentary on the chapter of the Decretals \\"Ne innitaris\\" (Book I, De constitutionibus), in which he combats the doctrine of probabilism. Saint Alphonsus calls him \\"magnus rigoristarum princeps\\", the great prince of the rigorists (Homo apostolicus, Tract. I, no. 63; Theologia Moralis, IV, no. 669).

Pender (he assumed the additional name of Denison, his mother's maiden name, in 1890) was the third son of Sir John Pender, the founder of the Eastern Telegraph Company. His elder half-brother Sir James Pender, 1st Baronet (from Sir John Pender's first marriage) was the first chairman of Eastman Kodak (UK). John was educated at Eton College and in 1878 joined his father's company. He joined the board in 1881 and became managing director in 1893 and also deputy chairman in 1896. In June 1896 Guglielmo Marconi aged 22 applied for his first patent. The technological advances with electro-magnetic waves, that had no need for cables, that Marconi was to instigate would change the entire communications industry forever. In 1901 Eastern Telegraph and Anglo-American threatened Marconi with legal action in Newfoundland if Marconi was to continue to operate his wireless telegraphy, for the next two decades it was Cable versus Wireless. Denison-Pender and his colleagues initially saw no threat from the wireless technology as wireless was slow, had a lack of secrecy and was liable to be interrupted. In 1904 Denison-Pender and the board had conversations with Lee De Forest with a view to buying a percentage of his company but the Eastern Telegraph board declined to make the investment in the end. In 1917, following the retirement of Sir John Barry, he became chairman and his son, John Denison-Pender, 1st Baron Pender, succeeded him as managing director. In 1934, Imperial and International Communications, formerly the Eastern Telegraph Company, became Cable & Wireless. The new name was designed to more clearly reflect the combined radio and cable services which it offered, without reference to the Empire. Denison-Pender was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for his services to communications in the South African War. In the 1920 civilian war honours he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) for similar services during the First World War, in which his company was not only responsible for the lion's share of Britain's submarine telegraph cables, but also successfully cut off Germany's communications with the rest of the world.

Established in 1918, there are approximately 600 students currently enrolled over both campuses. History BMGS was founded in 1918 as Blue Mountains Church of England Boys Grammar School, in Springwood. It was a boarding school and the property was known as \\"Homedale\\", located in Springwood in the lower mountains. The Founding Headmaster was E.K. Deane and the first pastoral House formed in the School bears his name. Ken Deane's reasons for founding the school are uncertain, but it is believed that it was developed for the purpose of giving an education to children boarders in the central west and north west of the state.Ken Goodlet, 'Mountain Springtime: A History of Blue Mountains Grammar School', (Wentworth Falls: Blue Mountains Grammar School, 2002): 2. From this grounding Deane built the school into a multi-classroom premises in Springwood, which throughout the 1920s saw successes in student numbers and education initiatives. By 1930, however, the school faced considerable hurdles to keep going. A decline in enrolments occurred between 1930 and 1934, such that membership numbers, approximately 55 in 1929, had declined to 24 in the second term of 1932,Quarterly abstract of non-state schools, State Records Office, Kingswood. Deane struggled to keep the school alive, and in desperation lowered boarding fees to a pound a day, and making ends meet by growing his own food. By 1933 enrolments had grown to 45, but there was a backlog of debt that was built up from the school during that troublesome period. During the war years, the number of enrolments at the school kept up quite well, given that most parents wanted to send their children out of the Sydney area. This period also meant the end of Ken Deane's long career as headmaster of the school. Deane had seen the school turn from a one-classroom premises to a medium-sized school with vibrant sporting, educative and community facilities. His son, John Deane, succeeded him in 1945. John was confronted upon his arrival at the school with a burgeoning debt, as all of the schools assets had been laid in Ken Deane's name, with nothing in the bank.Ken Goodlet, 'Mountain Springtime: A History of Blue Mountains Grammar School', (Wentworth Falls: Blue Mountains Grammar School, 2002): 33. Another problem was the condition of the school grounds; with a loan from the Bank of New South Wales, John had the windows reglazed, repainted and re-roofed school buildings, forming a revitalised school grounds that helped attract new students. The move of the school to its current grounds in Wentworth Falls came with the purchase of 'Coorah' in 1951. In May 1951 John Deane wrote a letter to parents stating that the operations of the school would no longer be conducted in Springwood, but at the new site of the school in Wentworth Falls. About 80 students were transferred from the Springwood campus to the Wentworth Fall site.Ken Goodlet, 'Mountain Springtime: A History of Blue Mountains Grammar School', (Wentworth Falls: Blue Mountains Grammar School, 2002): 56. With a variety of dedicated benefactors, and the commitment of staff, students, and parents to the growth of the school, Blue Mountains Grammar School underwent a period of strategic growth between 1953 and 1960. Now under the leadership of Albert Pitt-Owen, it was promised that the school would be returned to sustainable enrolment numbers, but to do so required that Albert had the 'authority as well as responsibility'.Ken Goodlet, 'Mountain Springtime: A History of Blue Mountains Grammar School', (Wentworth Falls: Blue Mountains Grammar School, 2002): 66. 1953-1959 saw a significant period of development with land purchases, building, and a general rise in student numbers. In 1961, after the firm establishment of the Junior School, Albert Pitt-Owen signaled his intention to expand the establishment with a Senior school campus. In 1965 that Senior school moved from its initial location at 'Blue Horizons' to its current location at Coorah, Wentworth Falls. The school now caters to approximately 600 students, and is presided over by the current Headmaster, Ian Maynard.
