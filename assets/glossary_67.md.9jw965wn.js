(Santiago is the largest island of the Cape Verde archipelago.) An English expedition led by Francis Drake captured the port town of Cidade Velha in the Cape Verde islands that had recently belonged to the Crown of Portugal. He sacked it and then marched inland before doing the same at São Domingos and Praia. Afterwards Drake left and continued his expedition to successfully raid the Spanish possessions in the Americas.Bicheno 186-88 Background War had already been declared by Phillip II of Spain after the Treaty of Nonsuch in which Elizabeth I had offered her support to the rebellious Protestant Dutch rebels. The Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World in a kind of preemptive strike.Mancall p. 166-67 =Expedition= The expedition gathered at Plymouth, England on 14 September 1585 with Sir Francis Drake in command of twenty one ships with 1,800 soldiers under Christopher Carleill. Sailing from Plymouth he first attacked Vigo in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. Drake however intended this to be a diversionary raid where it was hoped to trick the Spanish to think they were not heading towards the Caribbean, by doing this he had already made sure his presence was felt at Las Palmas in the Canary islands. After taking on water from the undefended La Gomera island, he continued his voyage, heading south towards the former Portuguese Cape Verde Islands. By virtue of the Iberian Union, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was in abeyance, and the commencement of war with Spain, Portuguese colonies and ships were now a target for the English. =Cape Verde= The Cape Verde Islands were a relatively poor archipelago that until 1580 had been Portuguese, but after was controlled by Spain. The town of Cidade Velha lay on the south-west side of the island of Santiago, the largest island in the Cape Verde archipelago and it served as a major base for Portuguese slaving operations on the West African coast, and was an exporter of both sugar and cloth. The town was protected by two batteries that covered the anchorage and a third was sited on lower ground to the west, covering the landward approach, in all totaling nearly fifty guns but the defenses were in need of repair.Keeler 27-8 Drake arrived off the islands in early November and set about planning his assault, in effect this would be baptism by fire for his men and a good rehearsal for future attacks. Capture On the evening of 11 November, under cover of darkness Christopher Carleill's assault force consisting of nearly 1,000 men landed on a beach four miles to the east. There was no resistance and they set off on a night march towards the town. Sir Francis Drake =Cidade Velha= Drake's ships moved into position on the Queen's Accession Day and he ordered the firing of ordnance in her honor and began bombarding the town's defenses. The Spanish and Portuguese returned fire, but their firing was sporadic, and it soon petered out while Carleill's men stormed the batteries and took the guns. The inhabitants were fleeing out of the town and then the English stormed down the hill and into the empty town; the only inhabitants who remained were a few elderly residents, and twenty six patients with fever in the slave hospital. By dawn the Cross of St George was flying over the town, Drake's men looted what they could and captured seven Portuguese slave ships lying at anchor off the town, one of which was added to the fleet, while the rest were stripped of anything of value. Also captured was a caravel being built in a shipyard but the English upon their discovery of it disassembled the vessel . Old bronze Portuguese and Spanish guns and equipment were taken from the batteries, in addition gun powder, silk, and cloth were seized from the town's warehouses. The houses were ransacked for food and the grove stripped of their fruit before finally, the bronze bells from the town's cathedral were taken. Drake set up his headquarters and sent emissaries to track down some of the inhabitants, as he planned to hold the town and burn it unless the island's governor paid him a ransom. After a number of days however there was no response, so Drake rounded up the prisoners he had captured and interrogated them. The few that Drake held told him that the governor Gaspar de Andrade was in the nearby village of São Domingos, a few miles inland so an expedition was prepared. =São Domingos= Drake and Carleill led a force of 600 men in a trek into the dry and arid hills of Santiago island. The inhabitants of São Domingos fled when the English approached, so Drake and his men looted what little they could, then burned the village to the ground. The English returned to the coast, shadowed as they went by local militia; two stragglers were intercepted, killed, and mutilated. On 28 November, Drake made one last attempt to force the Spanish governor to pay a ransom; he was aware of a small settlement called Praia and so had plans to seize that too . =Praia= Drake sent Carleill on another expedition nine miles along the coast to the east, until he reached Praia. Carleill's arrival coincided with the appearance of Drake and the fleet off the town's beach at dawn the following morning. The 1,000 or so inhabitants fled to safety, leaving Drake in control of the town who ordered it to be razed to the ground, sparing only the town hospital, but the plunder was scarce and then set back to Santiago. Drakes voyage to the West Indies showing the raid at Santiago Drake left within a day of the capture of Porto Praia, but before he did so he ordered Cidade Velha to be razed as a final message to governor and the Spanish. Aftermath On the last day of November, his ships then headed westward, out into the Atlantic Ocean heading towards the Caribbean and the Americas mainland to strike at Spain's New World empire. Although many in the fleet had succumbed to tropical illnesses, this was achieved spectacularly in three separate blows, firstly at Santo Domingo, Cartagena de Indias, and finally at St. Augustine.Kuiper p. 38 After the raids he then went on to find Sir Walter Raleigh's settlement much further North at Roanoke which he replenished and took back with him a few colonists. He finally reached England on July 22, when he sailed into Portsmouth, England to a heroes welcome. After Drake and the English had left, the Spanish and Portuguese after the attack strengthened the defenses and soon by 1590 Fort Real de São Filipe was built which still stands today.Nunes p264  See also  * Battle of Santo Domingo (1586) * Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586) * Raid on St. Augustine References ;Bibliography   * * ;External links * * Category:Francis Drake Category:History of the Royal Navy Category:Conflicts in 1585 Category:Military campaigns involving England Category:Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) Category:History of Cape Verde Category:History of Santiago, Cape Verde Category:1585 in South America Category:1585 in the British Empire Category:1585 in the Spanish Empire ","title":"Capture of Santiago (1585)"},{"id":"42168642","text":"The Child Protection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act of 1990 , Title III of the Crime Control Act of 1990, , , is part of a United States Act of Congress which amended in respect to record-keeping requirements as set by the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988, also establishing prohibitions. The Act also amended and establishing and increasing penalties for sexual abuse of a minor. Also see Child Protective Services, for global practices and the approach of US. History The initial version of 2257 as passed in the 1988 Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988, mandated that producers of pornographic material keep records of the age and identity of performers and affix statements as to the location of the records to depictions. However, rather than penalties for noncompliance, the statute created a contradictable presumption that the performer was a minor. This version was struck down as unconstitutional under the First Amendment in American Library Association v. Thornburgh . In this case the constitutionality of the Act was scrutinized before district court for the District of Columbia. This lawsuit was initiated by the producers and distributors of books, magazines, and films. The court found record-keeping provisions burdensome in terms of right to produce regarding materials protected by the First Amendment. The court also mentioned that the Act was not precisely designed to advocate governmental interest of stopping child pornography. Since the Act did not include particular sanction neither for failure to keep nor complete the records. Another unconstitutional aspect of the Act was criminal presumptions. The court mentioned that these provisions failed to comply with constitution because they created a strong possibility for convicting innocent persons who had not engaged in child pornography. And this was a contradiction with the due process right of the accused to be assumed innocent until proven guilty. Also see, In part, the Child Protection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act of 1990 was designed to \\"correct[] the record keeping provisions of the Child Pornography and Obscenity Enforcement Act so that it will comply with a U.S. district court's decision in the case of American Library Association versus Thornburgh.\\"136 Cong. Rec. S9029 (daily ed. June 28, 1990) (statement of Sen. Thurmond) According to the Bill's summary,http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi- bin/bdquery/z?d101:SN03266:@@@L&summ2;=m& apart from removing the unconstitutional provision, it was also intended: *To amend the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 in order to: **Prohibit: (1) The sale or transfer of any pornographic material lacking a statement of the location of records with respect to the performance depicted on every copy; or (2) failing to create or maintain records or to comply with provisions of such Act or from knowingly making a false entry or failing to make an appropriate entry in such records. **Establish criminal penalties for violations of such act and replace the term \\"lascivious exhibitions of genitals or public areas\\" for \\"sexually explicit conduct\\" for purposes of sexual exploitation provisions. *Direct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend guidelines for sentences involving sexual crimes against children so that more substantial penalties may be imposed if the Commission determined that former penalties were inadequate. *Increases the maximum penalty for sexual abuse of a minor from 5 to 15 years imprisonment. *Establish penalties for: (1) possessing with intent to sale any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving minors; and (2) possessing three or more materials containing such depictions (excluding depictions by words alone). Limits on the amount of fines for such possession and for other activities were eliminated. The Child Protection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act of 1990 was composed of two subtitles. *\\"Subtitle A—Restoration of Recordkeeping Requirements\\" amended by striking out and replacing subsections (d) and (e) and inserting subsections (f), (g), (h) and (i). itself was added by the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988. *\\"Subtitle B—Sexual Abuse Penalties\\" amended subsection (a), and subsections (a) and (b). Legal challenges After the amendments, the same Plaintiffs whose claims resulted in the determination of the unconstitutionality of the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988, challenged again the constitutionality of as amended by the Child Protection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act of 1990 in the case named American Library Association v. Reno. However, by the time of the hearing before the court, the Congress had corrected the Act through legislation. The court reversed District Court's decision. United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the Act was a content-neutral statute that serves a compelling Government interest; and its provisions met the intermediate scrutiny standard established by the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. The Court upheld this new version and considered it to be a \\"content-neutral statute that serves a compelling Government interest\\", therefore finding that said provisions \\"meet the intermediate scrutiny standard established by the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence\\". In 2010 the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C.S. §§ 2257, 2257A, age verification and recordkeeping statutes designed to deter child pornography was challenged before United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Free Speech Coalition, Inc. v. Holder. In this case the court discussed the balance between the sexual exploitation of children in the production of pornography and infringement of the right of free speech guaranteed by the Constitution. Plaintiffs, producers and distributors of sexually explicit material, indicated chill out effect that was allegedly created by provisions on recordkeeping and the deterrence child pornography and thus the Act was infringing First Amendment rights. The court held that \\"to the extent producers have any reasonable expectation of privacy in age-verification records relating to depictions of sexually explicit conduct, that expectation is reduced\\". The court also noted that government's interest in preventing sexual exploitation of children in the production of such depictions. According to court producers of such depictions are aware that their records will periodically be inspected by government officials. And Congress has both authorized inspections and created rules. Upon this legal challenges some sources recommend that virtual child pornography should be regulated from a different perspective. It is suggested that this category should be evaluated in terms of obscene speech. By doing so, It can be distinguished from child pornography depicting actual children in a more proper and constitutional manner.

It was last assigned to the Western Flying Training Command, and was disbanded on 16 June 1946 at Napier Field, Alabama. The wing controlled World War II Phase One primary flying training units of the Army Air Forces Training Command. Headquartered at Moody Field, Georgia for most of its operational service, it controlled contract civilian-operated pilot schools primarily in the Southeastern United States. There is no lineage connection between the 29th Flying Training Wing, established on 22 December 1939 as the 29th Bombardment Group (Heavy) at Langley Field, Virginia, and this organization. History Until 1939, the United States Army Air Corps provided all flying training with military instructor pilots. Beginning in 1939, it contracted with nine civilian flying schools to provide primary flight training. Primary training consisted of a three-month course of 65 hours of flying instruction. As the United States prepared to enter World War II by expanding its number of flying squadrons, the number of contract primary schools increased.Manning, Thomas A. (2005), History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942–2002. Office of History and Research, Headquarters, AETC, Randolph AFB, Texas ASIN: B000NYX3PC According to the contract, the government supplied students with training aircraft, flying clothes, textbooks, and equipment. The Air Corps also put a detachment at each school to supervise training. The schools furnished instructors, training sites and facilities, aircraft maintenance, quarters, and mess halls. From the Air Corps, schools received a flat fee of $1,170 for each graduate and $18 per flying hour for students eliminated from training. Following the fall of France in 1940, the Air Corps upped its pilot production goal to 7,000 per year. To meet that goal, the Air Corps increased the capacity of its schools and added more contract primary schools. The vast majority of contract primary pilot training ended in the spring of 1944 as part of the rundown of Army pilot training. The ones remaining open ended their operations in October, 1945. = Lineage= * Established as 29th Flying Training Wing on 17 December 1942 : Activated on 26 December 1942 : Disbanded on 16 June 1946.29th Flying Training Wing, lineage and history document Air Force Historical Agency, Maxwell AFB, Alabama =Assignments= * Army Air Forces Southeast Flying Training (later, AAF Eastern Flying) Command, 26 December 1942 * Western Flying Training Command, 15 December 1945 – 16 June 1946 =Stations= * Moody Field, Georgia, 26 December 1942 * Napier Field, Alabama, 1 April 1945 – 16 June 1946 =Training aircraft= Fairchild PT-19 monoplane trainer CPS Primary Trainers were primarily PT-17 Stearman biplanes and Fairchild PT-19s monoplanes, although a wide variety of other types could be found at the airfields.

Later on she changed her name to Suzy King and started her iconic act of performing with pythons. Sampaio had her peak during the 1950s when public fakirism was most popular. She was a multi-media star of sorts when such a term did not exist yet, always making sure newspapers would keep abreast of what she was doing. Sampaio wrote a play that was banned by the authorities. She also tried to emulate Lady Godiva wearing a long blond wig to cover her breasts and riding a horse through the center of the city. She was almost gang-raped by a mob and was saved by a passerby. She left for Mexico in the late 1960s, where she changed her name to Yacui Yapura Sampaio Bailey.

Anthony. Its stated purpose was to create \\"an association of working-women which might act for the interests of its members, in the same manner as the associations of workingmen now regulate the wages, etc., of those belonging to them.\\"The Revolution, September 24, 1868, p. 181. Quoted in Flexner (1959), p. 128 Shortly afterwards Anthony was seated as a delegate of the WWA at the annual congress of the National Labor Union (NLU), the first national labor federation in the U.S.Balser (1987), p. 65 The WWA's membership grew to include over a hundred wage-earning women in addition to journalists and other women whose work was more intellectual than manual. Concentrated in the printing industry in its early days, WWA members included women who were or had been employed in printing shops (and their female employers in some cases) and also self-employed printers. Its officers, again mainly printers, were: President, Mrs. Anna Tobbitt; Vice Presidents, Susie Johns, Augusta Lewis, Emily Peers; Secretary, Elizabeth Brown; Treasurer, Julia Brown.DuBois (1978), pp. 133–134 The new organization rejected Stanton's proposal to name itself the Working Women's Suffrage Association, and it decided not to campaign for women's suffrage until it was more solidly established as an organization.DuBois (1978), pp. 134–135 The organization drew the attention of the press, including the New York Times, which ran an editorial ridiculing the WWA for demanding equal pay for equal work, arguing that women's willingness to work for less gave them an advantage in the labor market.DuBois (1978), p. 139 The WWA assisted several of its members in the creation of the Women's Typographical Union. That attracted the interest of the National Typographical Union, which traditionally had refused to admit women as members. It now agreed to accept the newly formed Women's Typographical Union as an affiliate, becoming the second national union (after the cigar makers) to admit female members.DuBois (1978), pp. 142, 154 When a printers' strike broke out in 1869, members of the Women's Typographical Union cooperated fully with the strike. Anthony, on the other hand, voiced support for a company-run training program for women printers that would have the effect of enabling them to replace striking male printers. From Anthony's point of view, she was simply promoting increased job opportunities for women, one of her declared intentions. From the union's point of view, her action amounted to support for strikebreaking. Anthony later apologized for her actions, but the damage was done. At the NLU congress in 1869, Anthony was first seated as a delegate but then unseated the next day after intense debate.DuBois (1978), pp. 153–159 As the female union printers began to work more closely with their male counterparts, their ties with the WWA weakened. Without those ties, however, their position within the union weakened, and they were soon protesting that they were once again being shut out of the industry.DuBois (1978), pp. 153, 160 The WWA also tried to create a Sewing Machine Operators Union, but this attempt failed, partly because of the difficulty of unionizing semi-skilled workers at that time. Male workers in that industry were not unionized either. The WWA also made attempts to organize co-operative shops for female printing workers and sewing machine workers who were excluded from male-only commercial shops.DuBois (1978), p. 144 The WWA played a leading role, along with The Revolution, in the campaign to win the release of Hester Vaughn, a domestic worker who had been found guilty of infanticide and sentenced to death. Charging that the social and legal systems treated women unfairly, the WWA petitioned, organized a rally in New York, and sent delegations to visit Vaughn in prison and to speak with the governor. Vaughn was eventually pardoned.Balser (1987), p. 72 The Hester Vaughn campaign attracted middle class women to the WWA at the same time that wage-earning women were losing interest in it. By 1869 the membership was made up almost entirely of middle class working women, including journalists, doctors and other professionals.DuBois (1978), p. 151 When Anthony and Stanton formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869, its New York City section was composed largely of WWA members, who continued to meet and engage in much the same work as before but now as members of the NWSA.DuBois (1978), p. 193 The WWA disbanded in December 1869, shortly after Sarah F. Norton became its president, and not long after the NWSA was formed. References Bibliography * DuBois, Ellen Carol (1978).

First settled by the Timucua, the area was eventually settled by the Seminoles. During the Second Seminole War, Wahoo and the surrounding area served as shelter to the Seminoles and as the site of several skirmishes. After the war, white settlers migrated to the area and established a thriving town. Today, the rural community is connected to the nearby town of Bushnell. Wahoo is home to a middle-aged population whose ancestry mainly hails from Europe. As for the battle site, it is protected by the state of Florida for ecological purposes. History =Name= The origin of the town's name is unknown. The word \\"wahoo\\" itself does not appear in any of the native languages, but English settlers anglicized the Muskogee word \\"vhahwu\\" to \\"wahoo\\" circa 1770. Sumter County historians believe that the town's name is derived from the wahoo trees, or the winged elms, that grew in the area. =Early inhabitants= The Timucua were the first to arrive in the area of present-day Wahoo. The group of tribes formed the Paracoxi Confederacy, or Urribaracuxi, united under Chief Paracoxi. In May 1539, a group of Spanish explorers, led by Hernando de Soto passed near the area. Historians believe that the introduction of malaria by DeSoto's expedition spread throughout the river valleys and killed about two-thirds of the Timucuan population. Those who survived migrated to St. Augustine. During the Queen Anne's War, Colonel James Moore raided Timucua villages and either sent them to the allies or to prisons. Members of the Upper Creek Seminole tribe settled in the area between 1767 and 1823, with most arriving following the Creek War of 1813-1814. Prior to the Creek War, the Creeks became concerned and angered over America's expansion into tribal lands. At the same time, the Creek National Council decided to use government annuity payments toward settling debts at the time where the Creek economy was transitioning from a trade economy to an agriculturally based economy. After several skirmishes between settlers and the Creeks, the Creek National Council publicly executed the offenders, a punishment traditionally performed by families. The Upper Creeks (Red Sticks) rebelled against the council. They attacked other Creeks who sided with the Americans. When the conflict ended in 1814, the war had killed about 15% of the Creeks and destroyed more than 48 towns in the Upper Creek territory in Alabama. =The Second Seminole War= CR 48 DeSoto Trailhead - Battle of Wahoo Swamp Plaque When the United States government negotiated the Treaty of Moultrie Creek in 1824, government officials placed the Wahoo Swamp area with the boundary of the second reservation located in present-day Central Florida. The Seminoles began moving there shortly after the signing of the treaty. The Seminoles' dependence on government rations after a famine caused by a late rainy season led to the federal government's decision to relocate the Seminoles to reservations west of the Mississippi River. The Seminole leaders, predominately Osceola and the Wahoo Swamp resident Chief Jumper, protested the move. In the meantime, white settlers violated the Treaty of Moultrie Creek by moving onto the public lands, and slave hunters trespassed onto the reservation to capture black Seminoles without proof of ownership. After the murder of Charley Emathla, Seminoles living near Fort King began moving their families to the Wahoo Swamp for protection as hostilities between the Seminole and the United States Army increased. In late 1835, General Duncan Clinch planned to attack the families living in the towns in the Wahoo Swamp to start a war that would force the Seminoles' to comply with the Treaty of Payne's Landing. He ordered two companies, headed by Fraser and Gardiner to move from Fort Brooke (near present-day Tampa) to Fort King (in present-day Ocala). In early December 1835, General Clinch also gathered volunteers from various settlements in the area and regular soldiers in a company named the Florida Rangers and stationed them at his plantation \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of the area and 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of the present-day town of Micanopy, Florida. As for the Seminoles, the Seminole men moved the women and children to another village for protection while the men stayed behind. After Dade's Battle on December 28, 1835, the parties returned to the Wahoo Swamp 5 miles (8 kilometers) away. On December 29, 1835, General Duncan Clinch led the 250 regulars and 460 militiamen from his plantation toward the Wahoo Swamp. The army's guides led the men to a swift and deep spot in the Withlacoochee River. Osceola and Abraham, a freed slave who served as an interpreter during the negotiations of the Treaty of Payne's Landing, led 250 Seminole and 30 black Seminole in an ambush while Clinch's men were crossing the Withlacoochee River. The Battle of the Withlacoochee River ended when Clinch and his men dismounted from their horses and charged at the Seminole, who retreated into the swamp. The army had several more skirmishes in the area during the war. In October 1836, Call began an expedition to destroy the village but had to abandon the trip as the detachment experienced food shortages and as they encountered a fire on the western bank of the Withlacoochee River. On November 13, 1836, Call and his men arrive at the village and found it abandoned. He and his men burned the village. On November 21, Call and his men, which included Captain William Seton Maitland, for whom the city of Maitland, Florida was named, encountered a group of 420 Seminole and 200 black Seminole, who returned fire and retreated into the swamp. Call's men retreated as they did not want to cross the deep black water. Killed in the battle was David Moniac, a 34-year-old West Point graduate who served with the Creek Volunteers. Maitland, suffering from malaria, was severely wounded in the battle, which led to his suicide in August 1837. His remains were buried near Wahoo until they were moved to Saint Augustine, Florida. In May 1840, Brevet Brigadier General Walker Keith Armistead searched the area. In 1841, Lieutenant C.R. Gates of the 8th Infantry found three villages hidden by willow trees and accessible by canoe. The villages had pumpkin and cornfields and a coontie processing area. On January 25, 1842, Companies B & K 2nd Infantry and Detachment Company G 2nd Infantry, led by Major J. Plympton, captured two Seminole. Two soldiers were wounded, and one was killed during the skirmish. In addition, another battle occurred on February 12, 1842. In that skirmish, one soldier from Company H, 8th Infantry, led by 1st Lieutenant P. Smirsh, was killed and another was injured. =Post-settlement= Many white settlers migrated to the area from Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina in the mid- to late-1800s, as, according to John Lee Williams, an author who explored the northern and central portions of Florida in the 1830s, the Wahoo Swamp area was excellent for the cultivation of sugar cane. Finding fields that had been cultivated by the Seminole, the settlers settled in five distinct communities in the area: Gum Slough (first settled in 1845), Bay Hill, Hay's Ferry, Wahoo, and Weed's Landing. Between 1846 and the 1890s, the town had a Baptist church (which remains today), stores, and a sawmill. Most of the community's residents stayed at home, although at least one resident visited Bushnell. In 1994, the Sumter County Board of Commissioners planned to move Wahoo residents' fire protection from the Bushnell fire department to the Tri-County fire department in Nobleton, Florida. The move would have increased the share of the county fire assessment revenue for other towns in the county. Wahoo residents protested, stating that they preferred the Bushnell fire department's plan to provide the town with a substation. The Bushnell fire department's plan was to address the issues of the length of response to calls, which averaged between 15 and 18 minutes to reach Wahoo, and the potential for delays caused by CSX trains traveling through the Bushnell city limits. Seeking to protect the site of the Battle of the Wahoo Swamp, the Sumter County Historical Society applied in 2002 to have the 850-acre site placed under the protection of the state of Florida. The Florida Acquisition and Restoration Council granted the application and placed the site on the 2003 Florida Forever Priority list for the area's biodiversity. Geography CR 48 DeSoto Trailhead Shelter The town of Wahoo is located at 28°41′26″ N and 82°11′44″ W (28.6905462, -82.1956434). It has an elevation of 49 feet (15 meters) above sea level. Both the town of Bushnell, Florida and Interstate 75 lie six miles (9.6 kilometers) to the east while County Road 48 runs through the town. County Road 48 enters Wahoo from the west and turns south as it exits the town en route to Bushnell. About 0.2 miles (0.32 kilometers) north of the site of the battle lies the Jumper Creek Wildlife Management Area, a tract of the Withlacoochee State Forest managed by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The town is considered to be a part of Bushnell, Florida. Climate The average low for the month of January is 45.5 °F (7.5 °C) while the average high is 70.9 °F (21.6 °C). In July, the average high is 91.5 °F (33.0 °C) while lows average 70.5 °F (21.4 °C). The average precipitation from April 1, 1918, to April 30, 2012, was 50.04 inches (127.10 centimeters). No snow fell during that period. Ecology The town of Wahoo has four different types of soil: Kanapaha sand, Ft. Green fine sand, Adamsville fine sand, and Sparr fine sand. All four soils are poorly drained and slowly permeable that formed in marine sediments; they also support forest areas. Ft. Green fine sand is a dark gray soil that is poorly drained. Ft. Green fine sand is found adjacent to flood plains. These sands formed from the Middle Eocene to the Holocene period. Under the soils lay limestone. The nearby Wahoo Swamp has several areas, or \\"islands\\", of hardwood hammocks surrounded by freshwater marsh and cypress swamp. The area is home to a rare limestone habitat that can support ferns and orchids; most other similar habitats have been mined or drained. The area also has over 250 rare native plants, including several rare ferns and orchids. Demographics According to the United States Census Bureau's American Community Surveys from 2008 to 2012, Wahoo had an estimated population of 2,673. The median age of the population was 52.4, compared to the Sumter County median age of 62.0. In 2012, the median income for Wahoo residents was estimated to be $31,951 (USD), compared to $53,046 (UDS), the median income of Sumter County residents in general.

Local attractions Operated by the Sumter County Board of County Commissioners, the Wahoo Community Building and its grounds are a combination of a community building and a historical monument. The building itself has two meeting rooms. The park surrounding the building has six picnic tables and two grills. The Wahoo Historical Monument is located in the park. The plaque, sponsored by the Sumter County Historical Society and the Florida Department of State, describes the events of the Battle of Wahoo Swamp. In September 1977, the Sumter County Board of County Commissioners authorized the placement of the plaque on the grounds of the Wahoo Community Center.

The Philadelphia Inquirer, which covered the trial itself, used Vaughn. The Revolution, which afterwards conducted a campaign in her defense, used Vaughan. The New York Times article on the mass meeting in her defense used Vaughn except when quoting directly from resolutions passed by the meeting, which used Vaughan. was a domestic servant in Philadelphia who was arrested in 1868 on a charge of killing her newborn infant, and was sentenced to hang after being convicted of infanticide. The Revolution, a women's rights newspaper established by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, conducted a campaign to win her release from prison. The Working Women's Association, an organization that was formed in the offices of The Revolution, organized a mass meeting in New York City in her defense. Eventually Vaughn was pardoned by the governor of Pennsylvania, and deported back to her native England. Arrest and trial Hester Vaughn was an Englishwoman who came to the United States in 1863. Some contemporary accounts suggest that she had immigrated along with a husband, whom she later discovered to be a bigamist. By 1868, she was reportedly unmarried and employed as a domestic servant in Philadelphia. In February of that year - after attempting to conceal her pregnancy - she gave birth alone in a rented room. Neighbors later discovered her there with her dead infant and informed the police.This outline of Vaughn's story comes from footnotes by Ann D. Gordon to an article called \\"Infanticide\\" in The Revolution, August 6, 1868, p. 74, which is reprinted in Gordon (2000), pp. 158–159. Contemporary sources provide other variations of this story, but they are often contradictory. For example, one version says that the man who impregnated Vaughn was her employer, while another says that she refused to identify him. Vaughn was arrested and charged with the first- degree murder of her child. In July, 1868, she was tried for infanticide in Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas, with judge James R. Ludlow presiding. According to a contemporary Philadelphia newspaper account, the coroner testified that the newborn baby had suffered severe injuries to the skull. Vaughn was reported to have said that she had been startled by someone coming into her room and had fallen on the baby, killing it.Philadelphia Inquirer, July 1, 1868, p. 2, under the heading \\"Legal Intelligence.\\" The conclusion of this trial is reported in the same newspaper on page 3 of the issue for July 2 beneath the same heading. These digitized newspaper images are produced by the Fultonhistory.com service. The all-male jury found her guilty of deliberately killing her child, and she was sentenced to death by hanging. The judge was later reported to have said that infanticide had become so common that \\"some woman must be made an example of.\\"\\"The Case of Hester Vaughan,\\" The Revolution, December 10, 1868, pp. 357–358.  Defense campaign  In August, 1868, the women's rights newspaper The Revolution, established by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, launched a campaign in Vaughn's defense. According to historian Sarah Barringer Gordon, women's rights activists had been searching for a popular cause through which to raise awareness about women's oppression when Vaughn's case came to their attention. The newspaper initially described Vaughn as a \\"poor, ignorant, friendless and forlorn girl who had killed her newborn child because she knew not what else to do with it,\\" elaborating that \\"If that poor child of sorrow is hung, it will be deliberate, downright murder. Her death will be a far more horrible infanticide than was the killing of her child.\\" In a nod to the issue of women's suffrage, the editorial also mentioned that Vaughn had been wronged by \\"the legislature that enacted the law\\" under which she was tried, for as a woman, she necessarily had no \\"vote or voice\\" in such matters.\\"Infanticide\\", The Revolution, August 6, 1868, p. 74, which is reprinted in Gordon (2000), pp. 158–159. As its campaign developed, The Revolution modified its approach. In December, 1868, it argued that Vaughn had become pregnant through \\"brute force,\\" suggesting she had been raped. It also implied that the infant's death had occurred either naturally or accidentally: \\"During one of the fiercest storms of last winter she was without food or fire or comfortable apparel. She had been ill and partially unconscious for three days before her confinement, and a child was born to Hester Vaughan. Hours passed before she could drag herself to the door and cry out for assistance, and when she did it was to be dragged to a prison.\\" The Working Women's Association (WWA), an organization that had been formed in the offices of The Revolution, made Vaughn's case its first public cause, with a goal of obtaining her pardon from Pennsylvania governor John W. Geary. In November, 1868, Anna Dickinson, a well-known orator on the subject of women's rights, gave a lecture for the WWA at the Cooper Institute in New York City, in which she \\"described the girl's terrible wrongs and sufferings,\\" and declared her support. The WWA then sent a committee, which included Clemence Lozier, a female doctor, to Philadelphia to meet and interview Hester Vaughn in Moyamensing Prison. According to Dr. Lozier's report in The Revolution, Vaughn's only visitor prior to the committee's meeting was another female doctor, Dr. Smith. Both Dr. Lozier and Dr. Smith agreed that Vaughn was innocent of the charge of infanticide, and had almost certainly suffered from \\"puerperal mania,\\" now understood as postpartum psychosis. Among other symptoms, this had included temporary blindness, leading them to argue that if the infant had indeed been born living - which was unclear, as it has never been examined - Vaughn may have inadvertently smothered it, as she was alone during and after the birth and could not see. After the committee's return, the WWA organized a large meeting on Vaughn's behalf, also held at the Cooper Institute. At the meeting, influential editor Horace Greeley urged the crowd to focus on Vaughn's release. Susan B. Anthony then introduced several resolutions, beginning with a call for a new trial, on the grounds that Vaughn had not been tried by a jury of her peers; or for an unconditional pardon, as Vaughn was \\"condemned on insufficient evidence and with inadequate defense.\\"\\"Hester Vaughn\\", New York Times, December 2, 1868 Other resolutions were broader in scope, calling for women to serve on juries and to have a voice in making laws and electing public officials, and for the end to the death penalty. All of the resolutions were adopted by the WWA. Elizabeth Cady Stanton also spoke at the meeting, where she issued a demand for women's suffrage, and for women to have the rights to hold public office and serve on juries. After the meeting, a New York newspaper reported that Vaughn's case was intended to be the first of many causes taken on by the WWA. \\"Miss Anthony wanted it understood that the workingwomen were going to defend the defenceless of their own sex,\\" it explained, and quoted Anthony as saying, \\"As soon as we get Hester Vaughan out of prison we will get somebody else to work for. We intend to keep up the excitement.\\"\\"The Termagants and the Slaughter of the Innocents\\", Rochester Union and Advertiser, December 3, 1868, p. 3. This quote also appears in the New York World, December 2, 1868, according to Sherr (1995), p. 218. The WWA, however, took on no additional legal cases, and by December, 1868, it had disbanded. Furthermore, the WWA's campaign for Hester Vaughn's release was also criticized in several newspapers. For example, according to the New York Evening Telegram, none of the speakers at the WWA's meeting \\"expressed the slightest sympathy with the thousands of poor little infants who are sacrificed to this puerperal mania or something else every month of the year... Hester Vaughn's murdered child is surely entitled to some pity as well.\\"\\"The Case of Hester Vaughn\\", New York Evening Telegram, Dec 2, 1868, p. 2 The Nation said that Vaughn's conviction was \\"denounced with as much fury as if the woman's story of bigamy, and the rape which the victim refuses to prove, made it in some mysterious way the duty of the Governor to treat the infanticide as really a blameless act\\".The Nation, Dec 10, 1868, \\"Women as Politicians,\\" pp. 475–476 Despite the case's divisiveness, Governor Geary pardoned Vaughn and she was deported back to England, though it was unclear if the above campaign was the motivation for the governor's decision.DuBois (1978), p. 145–147 After returning to England, Vaughn reportedly lived in illness and poverty.  Aftermath  There is no mention of Hester Vaughn in the History of Woman Suffrage _,_ Stanton and Anthony's multi-volume history of the women's suffrage movement, and articles about Vaughn stopped appearing in The Revolution in early 1869. In 1876, Stanton and Anthony's \\"Declaration of Rights of the Women of the United States\\" did reference infanticide, stating that women's lack of rights and representation on juries resulted in their unfair treatment within the legal system: \\"Young girls have been arraigned in our courts for the crime of infanticide; tried, convicted, hung - victims, perchance, of judge, jurors, advocates, while no woman's voice could be heard in their defence.\\"Gordon, Ann D., ed. (2003). The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony: National Protection for National Citizens, 1873 to 1880, p. 235. Vol. 3 of 6. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press. . Nevertheless, according to historian Sarah Barringer Gordon, suffragists faced a damaging public backlash for their support of a woman convicted of infanticide, and their work on Vaughn's behalf ultimately proved detrimental to their credibility.

Life  He was born into an old, established Rhenish merchant family. From 1863 to 1868, he studied with Oswald Achenbach at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. In 1871, he was summoned to the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School to teach landscape painting as a replacement for Max Schmidt, who had left to take another position. Three years later, he received a permanent appointment. He was head of the art department from 1876 to 1881, but grew tired of his administrative duties and returned to teaching. His best-known students were Christian Rohlfs, Hanns Diehl, and Franz Bunke. He was one of the founders of German Impressionism. After trying out several styles during his early years, he became attracted to the plein-air painting of the French Barbizon School. Through his friendship with Alfred Lichtwark, the first Director of the Kunsthalle Hamburg, he spent some time there, painting scenes of the harbor and the North Sea. From 1893, he was a member of the Munich Secession and, from 1902, the Berlin Secession. A street in Weimar has been named the Theodor-Hagen-Weg in his honor and his home (now Trierer Straße 36) is a municipal monument.

She also kept important documents for the Katipunan. Early life Marina was the daughter of José Dizon, one of the Thirteen Martyrs of Bagumbayan, and Roberta Bartolomé, who died when Marina was only eight years old. After her mother's death, her aunt, Josefa Dizon, mother of Emilio Jacinto, took care of her. Her father was an active associate of Andres Bonifacio and almost all of her family members were patriots and nationalists. She was enrolled at a private school that was led by Maestro Timoteo Reyes. Marina later studied at a public school under Aniceta Cabrera, where she met her classmate and future husband, José Turiano Santiago. She was a student of the arts, music, painting, and modeling, and later became an accomplished singer. She was the guitarist and violinist of the Trozo Comparsa Band. Katipunan In 1893, Marina accompanied her cousin Emilio Jacinto to the house of Don Restituto Javier. It was there that she and a number of other women were initiated into the Katipunan. Marina became an active member, presided over initiation rites, kept records, and taught new members the constitution and teachings. Marina always said, \\"Be cheerful at all times, do not show signs of any impending rebellion. Be prepared to be orphans and widows. Be brave and carry on\\". These are the words that inspired the women of the Katipunan. When her father was executed in Bagumbayan in 1897 and her husband was arrested in August of the same year, she burned all the records of the Katipunan in order to prevent the Spaniards from learning more about the group. She sold all her belongings to raise money to bribe her husband's guards. Finally, her husband was released on September 11, 1897.

She was member of the Tuscan branch of the Imperial House of Habsburg, an Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Tuscany by birth. After the fall of the Austro Hungary Empire, she lived under reduced circumstances with her family in Spain, Austria, and Italy. She died unmarried. Early life Archduchess Dolores was born in Lemberg, Austria, the eldest child of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria (1863–1931) and of his wife Blanca de Borbón y de Borbón-Parma (1868–1949). Her mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Dolores was given the baptismal names Maria de los Dolores Beatrix Carolina Blanca Leopoldina von Habsburg-Lothringen Archduchess Dolores grew up in the last period of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. She was educated in splendor. Her father, who had followed a career in the army, was also an inventor with a number of military patents under his name. Her mother was the domineering force in the family. Theirs was a multi-cultural household. Dolores's paternal ancestors had reigned in Austria, Tuscany and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Her mother's family had reigned in Spain, Parma and France. Archduchess Dolores was educated with her sisters Immaculata and Margaretha. The three sisters, very close in age, were artistically inclined.Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 115 Dolores was particularity skillful at drawing. Her education emphasised languages, and in addition to her native German, she learned French, Spanish, Hungarian and Italian. The family was wealthy. They had the Palais Toskana in Vienna and Schloss Wilhelminenberg as their country state. Vacations were spent in Italy where Infanta Blanca owned a rural property near Viareggio. During World War I, Archduchess Dolores's father and two eldest brothers fought with the Austro-Hungarian army. Exile At the fall of Habsburg monarchy, the republican government of Austria confiscated all the properties of the Habsburgs. Dolores' family lost all their fortune.McIntosh, The Unknown Habsburgs, p. 48 Her two eldest brothers, Archdukes Rainer and Leopold, decided to remain in Austria and recognized the new republic. Dolores with her parents and her other siblings emigrated to Spain. In January 1919 they arrived in Barcelona where they settled for over a decade. They lived modestly. While in Wilhelminenberg the family employed no less than 80 servants to attend their large household,Harding, Lost Waltz, p. 28 by contrast in Barcelona, Dolores her mother and sisters had to fence for themselves doing the house chores. With income from her father's military patents in France and with the sell of some of her mother jewels they were able to buy a house in Barcelona. Archduchess Dolores remained unmarried. She was mildly handicapped by a limp since childhood. The convulsed political situation in Spain during the Second Spanish Republic made the family returned to Austria. They were able to rent three rooms at their former residence in Vienna, the Palais Toskana. In March 1938 Hitler annexed Austria and Archduchess Dolores with her mother and youngest brother moved to Tenuta Reale, a villa belonging to his mother's family near Viareggio in Italy. As the situation there became increasingly dire due to the war, Archduchess Dolores her mother, her youngest brother, Archduke Karl, and his family moved back to Barcelona. When the war ended they returned to Viareggio. After the death of her mother, Archduchess Dolores returned to live in Barcelona.Mateos Saintz de Medrano, An Unconventional Family, p. 15.

Pisani was dispatched in 1352 to engage the Genoan navy, commanded by his counterpart and rival Paganino Doria, near Constantinople. There, Pisani won a victory in a brutal battle against the Genoans at the Bosphorus. However, this victory proved indecisive, as Venetian losses were so great they were unable to continue the assault. Pisani later inflicted another devastating blow by wiping out a Genoese fleet off Sardinia.Crowley, Roger (2011), City of Fortune: How Venice Rules the Seas, Random House, Pisani's distinguished career came to an end when Doria won a crushing victory over him at Porto Longo in 1354. While Pisani survived and escaped, the defeat would haunt him for the rest of his life. Only five of the approximately 40 galleys under his command escaped the battle, and Venice itself was only spared by a peace imposed on the two republics by the Duke of Milan. While the usual punishment for a Venetian admiral responsible for such a disaster would be death, Pisani's previous victories and popularity with the common people of the city earned him some clemency. However, Pisani was banned from holding future office and sentenced to six months in prison for his role in the catastrophe. Niccolò's son, Vettor Pisani, was with him at Porto Longo, and would go on to command the Venetian navy more than two decades later in another war with the Genoese. After several reversals during the campaign, Vettor would play a key role in the ultimate Venetian victory at Chioggia.

The revised simplex method is mathematically equivalent to the standard simplex method but differs in implementation. Instead of maintaining a tableau which explicitly represents the constraints adjusted to a set of basic variables, it maintains a representation of a basis of the matrix representing the constraints. The matrix-oriented approach allows for greater computational efficiency by enabling sparse matrix operations. Problem formulation For the rest of the discussion, it is assumed that a linear programming problem has been converted into the following standard form: : \\\\begin{array}{rl} \\\\text{minimize} & \\\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{x}  \\\\text{subject to} & \\\\boldsymbol{Ax} = \\\\boldsymbol{b}, \\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\ge \\\\boldsymbol{0} \\\\end{array} where . Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the constraint matrix has full row rank and that the problem is feasible, i.e., there is at least one such that . If is rank-deficient, either there are redundant constraints, or the problem is infeasible. Both situations can be handled by a presolve step. Algorithmic description =Optimality conditions= For linear programming, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are both necessary and sufficient for optimality. The KKT conditions of a linear programming problem in the standard form is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{Ax} & = \\\\boldsymbol{b},  \\\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} + \\\\boldsymbol{s} & = \\\\boldsymbol{c},  \\\\boldsymbol{x} & \\\\ge \\\\boldsymbol{0},  \\\\boldsymbol{s} & \\\\ge \\\\boldsymbol{0},  \\\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{x} & = 0 \\\\end{align} where and are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints and , respectively. The last condition, which is equivalent to for all , is called the complementary slackness condition. By what is sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of linear programming, a vertex of the feasible polytope can be identified by being a basis of chosen from the latter's columns. Since has full rank, is nonsingular. Without loss of generality, assume that . Then is given by : \\\\boldsymbol{x} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{x_B}  \\\\boldsymbol{x_N} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{B}^{-1} \\\\boldsymbol{b}  \\\\boldsymbol{0} \\\\end{bmatrix} where . Partition and accordingly into : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{c} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{c_B}  \\\\boldsymbol{c_N} \\\\end{bmatrix},  \\\\boldsymbol{s} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{s_B}  \\\\boldsymbol{s_N} \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{align} To satisfy the complementary slackness condition, let . It follows that : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{B}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} & = \\\\boldsymbol{c_B},  \\\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} + \\\\boldsymbol{s_N} & = \\\\boldsymbol{c_N}, \\\\end{align} which implies that : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} & = (\\\\boldsymbol{B}^{\\\\mathrm{T}})^{-1} \\\\boldsymbol{c_B},  \\\\boldsymbol{s_N} & = \\\\boldsymbol{c_N} - \\\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda}. \\\\end{align} If at this point, the KKT conditions are satisfied, and thus is optimal. =Pivot operation= If the KKT conditions are violated, a pivot operation consisting of introducing a column of into the basis at the expense of an existing column in is performed. In the absence of degeneracy, a pivot operation always results in a strict decrease in . Therefore, if the problem is bounded, the revised simplex method must terminate at an optimal vertex after repeated pivot operations because there are only a finite number of vertices. Select an index such that as the entering index. The corresponding column of , , will be moved into the basis, and will be allowed to increase from zero. It can be shown that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial (\\\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{x})}{\\\\partial x_q} = s_q, i.e., every unit increase in results in a decrease by in . Since :\\\\boldsymbol{B x_B} + \\\\boldsymbol{A}_q x_q = \\\\boldsymbol{b}, must be correspondingly decreased by subject to . Let . If , no matter how much is increased, will stay nonnegative. Hence, can be arbitrarily decreased, and thus the problem is unbounded. Otherwise, select an index as the leaving index. This choice effectively increases from zero until is reduced to zero while maintaining feasibility. The pivot operation concludes with replacing with in the basis. Numerical example Consider a linear program where : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{c} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -2 & -3 & -4 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}^{\\\\mathrm{T}},  \\\\boldsymbol{A} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 0  2 & 5 & 3 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix},  \\\\boldsymbol{b} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 10  15 \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{align} Let : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{B} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{A}_4 & \\\\boldsymbol{A}_5 \\\\end{bmatrix},  \\\\boldsymbol{N} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{A}_1 & \\\\boldsymbol{A}_2 & \\\\boldsymbol{A}_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\end{align} initially, which corresponds to a feasible vertex . At this moment, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}^{\\\\mathrm{T}},  \\\\boldsymbol{s_N} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -2 & -3 & -4 \\\\end{bmatrix}^{\\\\mathrm{T}}. \\\\end{align} Choose as the entering index. Then , which means a unit increase in results in and being decreased by and , respectively. Therefore, is increased to , at which point is reduced to zero, and becomes the leaving index. After the pivot operation, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{B} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{A}_3 & \\\\boldsymbol{A}_4 \\\\end{bmatrix},  \\\\boldsymbol{N} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{A}_1 & \\\\boldsymbol{A}_2 & \\\\boldsymbol{A}_5 \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{align} Correspondingly, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{x} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 5 & 5 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}^{\\\\mathrm{T}},  \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -4/3 \\\\end{bmatrix}^{\\\\mathrm{T}},  \\\\boldsymbol{s_N} & = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2/3 & 11/3 & 4/3 \\\\end{bmatrix}^{\\\\mathrm{T}}. \\\\end{align} A positive indicates that is now optimal. Practical issues =Degeneracy= Because the revised simplex method is mathematically equivalent to the simplex method, it also suffers from degeneracy, where a pivot operation does not result in a decrease in , and a chain of pivot operations causes the basis to cycle. A perturbation or lexicographic strategy can be used to prevent cycling and guarantee termination. =Basis representation= Two types of linear systems involving are present in the revised simplex method: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{B z} & = \\\\boldsymbol{y},  \\\\boldsymbol{B}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{z} & = \\\\boldsymbol{y}. \\\\end{align} Instead of refactorizing , usually an LU factorization is directly updated after each pivot operation, for which purpose there exist several strategies such as the Forrest−Tomlin and Bartels−Golub methods. However, the amount of data representing the updates as well as numerical errors builds up over time and makes periodic refactorization necessary.

In 1924 the United States Military Academy, West Point, N.Y. hired Mr. Marchand to coach its ice hockey and soccer teams, The Black Knights. He held that post for the next 20 years – the second longest tenure of any Army hockey coach before or since. That same year, for the first time in program history, Marchand took his ice hockey team, the Black Knights, across the border to face the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario. While the Paladins downed the Cadets, 10-5, in 1935 the Black Knights ended their 15-game losing streak with a 4-4 tie, and in 1939 they enjoyed their first victory, 3-2. The RMC vs USMA game is the most-played rivalry at the Academy to this day. The idea for this match-up between the Canadian and American service academies was crafted by then Brig. Gen. Douglas MacArthur and RMC's commandant, Maj. Gen. Sir Archibald Macdonnell. During Marchand's first nine years coaching the USMA ice hockey team, games were held during the winter on “The Plain” adjacent to Arvin Gym. During those days, the area was flooded with water in late fall so a rink could form by midwinter. In 1931, Marchand oversaw the opening of the Academy's indoor Smith Rink, where the present day Herbert Hall stands. Raymond Wilfred Marchand died in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York on April 6, 1969.

History =Origin= Argonaut Insurance was founded in California in 1948 as the Argonaut Insurance Exchange. It focused on underwriting workers compensation for the California construction industry. It was acquired in 1969 by Teledyne Technologies, then expanded into additional product lines and acquired Great Central Insurance. =1986-2000= In September 1986, Teledyne Technologies formed and then spun off Argonaut Group, with Argonaut Insurance and Great Central Insurance parts of the new company. It focused on underwriting large-account workers compensation policies. =2000-present= In January 2000 Mark E. Watson III, a board member since 1999, became President and CEO. The company moved its corporate office to San Antonio, Texas, in 2001. The firm acquired Front Royal, Inc. (along with its subsidiaries Colony and Rockwood), an insurance holding company headquartered in Morrisville, N.C. for $165 million in cash. The acquisition added products and underwriting capabilities in areas complementary to Argonaut’s previous products. Then they entered the public entity market by founding Trident Insurance. In 2002, they acquired Fulcrum, an excess and surplus lines underwriter from Scor. In 2003 they acquired Grocers from Royal & Sun Alliance USA, expanding their Great Central platform. In 2005 they acquired the renewal rights to business formerly written by Interstate Insurance Group, subsidiaries of Fireman’s Fund. In May 2005 they created Argonaut Specialty to underwrite accounts larger than what Colony traditionally wrote. In 2007 they merged with Bermuda-based PXRE, entering the reinsurance market. The new company renamed as Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd., and moved its public company home office to Bermuda, which offered a more favorable tax structure than the United States. In 2008, Trident Insurance Services acquired Massamont Insurance Agency, which specialized in insurance programs for public entities, expanding Argo's public entity footprint into New England with offices in Greenfield and Boston, Mass. In April 2008, Argonaut Group re-branded as Argo Group. U.S. operations were packaged as Argo Group US. Peleus Re was renamed Argo Re. In Europe, it became known as Argo Solutions. In May, Argo Group acquired Heritage and its Lloyd’s syndicate for $272 million in order to create a broader underwriting platform with extended geographic capability. In September 2008, they acquired Insight Insurance, a specialist in professional liability insurance for accounting professionals, architects, engineers and insurance agents. In October, they established Argo Pro, a consolidation of their professional liability operations. In 2010, the company paid out $25 million in claims to everyone present at the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Argo also insures concerts of the Irish rock band U2. In 2017, the company paid a claim to Disney, who had bought insurance against the possibility that actress Carrie Fisher would die before filming Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. In 2018, Argo moved the listing of its shares from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange, and its ticker symbol changed from AGII to ARGO. On May 7, 2018, CEO Mark Watson III rang the opening bell of the NYSE. In 2019, the company announced the retirement CEO Mark Watson III from Argo Group. Following the announcement, Argo Group’s board of directors named CFO Kevin Rehnberg interim CEO.

History and profile Al-Malayin was published between May and December 1951. It was unofficially linked to the communist Democratic Movement for National Liberation (HADITU). The launching of al-Malayin followed the closure of the pro-HADITU weekly al-Bashir in December 1950. Al-Bashir and al- Malayin gained importance in the national movement in Egypt at the time. Following the ban on al-Bashir, al-Malayin was a key channel for legal propaganda of the party. The owner and editor-in-chief of al-Malayin was Ahmad Sadiq Azzam. Prominent contributors to the newspaper included Yusuf Hilmu, Abd al-Murni as-Said, Rashid al-Barawi, Enayet al-Halim and Ibrahim Abd al-Halim. Al-Malayin advocated armed struggle against British rule in Egypt, and appealed to a united front of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Socialist Party, nationalists, Wafdist, workers and student movements to rally against Anglo- American imperialism. Al-Malayin was the first Egyptian communist newspaper which dedicated space for issues such as culture and sports. Its issues carried articles about the labourers, peasantry, women, art, theatre, literature and international issues. The newspaper dedicated relatively little attention to the Arab-Israeli conflict. In its comments to developments following the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, al-Malayin voiced criticism against treatments of the Jewish communities by governments in the Arab world. Al-Malayin was closed down by the Egyptian government in December 1951.

In 1818, he bought a stone house and 100 acres of land in Newark, Delaware. (The house still stands today; in 1983, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.) From October 1817 through September 1821, Whitely served in the Delaware House of Representatives. In 1824, he was elected to the state Senate as a delegate from New Castle County. (That same year, he was part of a group of dignitaries appointed to escort the Marquis de Lafayette from the Pennsylvania state line to Wilmington.) He served as the Speaker of the Senate in 1827, during the 51st Assembly. In 1833, he became a director of the Farmers' Bank of Delaware. In 1838, he was a director of two of the four railroads that together built the first railroad south from Philadelphia: the Delaware and Maryland Railroad and the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad.

Britpop bands Blur, Oasis, Supergrass, and The Verve rule the airwaves and Cool Britannia is in full swing. Psychopathic twenty-seven-year- old A&R; man Steven Stelfox (Nicholas Hoult) is slashing and burning his way through the music business, a world where ‘no one knows anything’ and where careers are made and broken by chance and the fickle tastes of the general public. Fuelled by greed, ambition and inhuman quantities of drugs, Stelfox lives the dream, as he searches for his next hit record. But as the hits dry up and the industry begins to change, Stelfox takes the concept of “killer tunes” to a murderous new level in a desperate attempt to salvage his career.

Information Bulletin 99-1, September 1999. p. 92  Background  Pearl was born March 7, 1819 in Ashford, Connecticut. He first came to what was then the Wisconsin Territory in 1839, returned to Connecticut, came back and settled near Merton in Waukesha County. He returned to Connecticut once more, where he married Sarah Trowbridge (a fellow native of Ashford), and the two of them came to Wisconsin in 1844 to stay on the farm he had established in Lisbon.  Public office  Before Wisconsin had become a state, on August 14, 1846, a convention of the newly organized Liberty Party was held in Prairieville. Although Pearl was not himself a delegate, he was nominated by the convention to the office of County Register of Deeds for the upcoming election, but seems to have failed of election. He served on the first jury ever empaneled in the county; and was a member of the county board of supervisors for a one-year term in 1850. Pearl was elected to a one-year term in the Assembly's 4th Waukesha County district (the Towns of Brookfield, Lisbon, Menomonee and PewaukeeManual for the use of the assembly, of the state of Wisconsin, for the year 1853 Madison: Brown and Carpenter, Printers, 1853; pp. 66, 99) in 1852 as a Free Soil candidate, after a redistricting had cost the county one of its Assembly seats. He was succeeded the next year by Whig Chauncey Purple.  Later years  In later years Pearl identified with the Republican Party which carried on the ideals of the Liberty and Free Soil parties; and served as a justice of the peace in Lisbon. He died November 20, 1896 in his home in Lisbon after a rapid decline; he had not been actively engaged in farming for many years, but leased his lands and lived quietly in his home. His wife had died a few months earlier, on February 3, 1896.

He undertook a Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne, as a resident of Queen's College (University of Melbourne), then a doctorate at the University of Oxford supported by a Rhodes Scholarship at Magdalen College, Oxford. He worked at Oxford, Harvard and the University of Sydney, before moving to UNSW as Dean of Science. Research Crossley is interested in gene regulation. He studied an unusual genetic disorder termed Haemophilia B Leyden where patients recover after puberty. The condition results from mutations that disrupt the control region of the clotting factor IX gene. A testosterone responsive element accounts for post-pubertal recovery. He has also investigated abnormal patterns of globin gene expression and his work on mutations associated with the lifelong expression of the foetal haemoglobin gene may help in the treatment of thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia. He is using CRISPR-mediated gene editing to introduce beneficial mutations in cell lines as models for treating genetic diseases. He is also known for the initial identification and cloning of a significant number of genes encoding DNA-binding proteins and their associated co-regulators, KLF3, KLF8, KLF17, EOS IKZF4, PEGASUS, FOG1 ZFPM1, FOG2 ZFPM2, and CTBP2.

The film stars Priyanka Chopra in the lead role of the eponymous boxer, with Darshan Kumar and Sunil Thapa in supporting roles of her husband and mentor, respectively. Mary Kom depicts Kom's journey of becoming a boxer to her victory at the 2008 World Boxing Championships in Ningbo. The film marks the Hindi playback singing debut of Chopra, who provided her vocals for a song named \\"Chaoro\\" (a lullaby). Mary Kom was developed by writer Saiwyn Quadras, who suggested the storyline to Kumar when Kom was not a familiar name in India despite her numerous achievements. Kumar met Kom to ask her permission for the film, before her bronze medal victory at the 2012 Summer Olympics, which brought her recognition. Chopra underwent extensive physical training for four months to attain a muscular physique and learned the sport and Kom's distinct boxing style. Principal photography started in June 2013 at Filmistan, where the boxing sequences were filmed. After plans to shoot in Kom's hometown, Manipur, were dropped due to safety concerns, Mary Kom was shot in Dharamshala and Manali, where a major portion of Manipur was recreated. The film premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, becoming the first Hindi film to be screened on the opening night of the festival. Made on a budget of 180 million, Mary Kom was released on 5 September 2014 to generally positive reviews with praise for Chopra's performance. Upon its release, the film recorded the highest opening weekend of all time for a female-led Indian film. The film was a box office success, grossing 2.04 billion at the box office. Mary Kom is also ranked among the highest-grossing Indian films led by a female actor. Mary Kom received several accolades at award ceremonies across India. The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and was nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Film and Best Actress for Chopra. Additionally, Chopra won the Screen Award and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.  Plot  A young Mangte Chungeijang Kom, daughter of a rice farmer from Imphal, Manipur, finds a boxing glove in the remains of an air crash in 1991 in Kangathei. Kom is fascinated by the glove and grows up taking keen interested in boxing, despite her father's disapproval. During an early fight, she chases a boy and ends up in a boxing gym. After realising that the coach of the gym, Narjit Singh, was also the coach of the Asian champion Dingko Singh, Kom tells him about her boxing aspirations. He asks her to visit the gym for the next thirty days and says that he will only teach her if she is deserving enough. She starts visiting the gym, informing her mother but not her father. Days pass but her coach does not enquire about her. Due to Kom's dedication and stubbornness, Singh starts training her. Later, he suggests changing her name to Mary Kom. Kom challenges a local wrestler for money, in order get a household cow back, which the family had to sell off because of their financial troubles. This is where she meets the footballer Onler Kom. After winning the state-level championship, her father confronts her for keeping her involvement in the sport from him. When her father asks her to choose between him and boxing, she reluctantly chooses the sport. After watching her victorious 2002 Women's World Amateur Boxing Championships match on television, her father reconciles with Kom, and apologises to her for not understanding her passion for the sport. Meanwhile, Onler proposes to her and agrees never to ask her to quit boxing. After she wins the 2006 Women's World Amateur Boxing Championships, Kom agrees to marry him much to her coach's dissatisfaction. After the marriage, Kom gets pregnant and gives up her career to look after her family. Kom gives birth to twins and applies for a government job. However, she refuses the position of a police constable, feeling that as a world-champion boxer, she deserves better. It devastates her to learn that people no longer recognise her. Onler encourages her to restart her boxing training. She joins the gym again, leaving her husband to look after the twins at home. Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her. Kom then convinces Narjit Singh to train her, as she thinks that he is the one who can get the best out of her. After completing her training, she participates in the 2008 AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships and reaches the finals. Meanwhile, Onler informs her about one of her children having ventricular septal defect. In the subsequent fight, Kom fails to defend herself. After a knockout punch from her opponent, Kom hallucinates about her husband and children in the audience. She regains her strength and fights back, winning the championship.

Production  = Development = Mary Kom was hailed as a National hero after the Olympic win, which also highlighted her previous achievements During his work as an art director on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Saawariya (2007), Omung Kumar started writing two scripts simultaneously for his directorial debut. However, none of the films were made. He then asked writer Saiwyn Quadras to look for a female biographical subject for his first film, specifying \\"a role that no actress would turn down.\\" He added that he \\"wanted to make a film that would be like the Mother India of someone's career.\\" Historical personalities such as Rani Laxmi Bai and Queen Elizabeth I of England came up for discussion; however they did not inspire Kumar. Quadras put forward the name of five-time world boxing champion Mary Kom, who despite numerous achievements, was at that time an unfamiliar name in India. Kumar admitted that he felt disgusted after being told of Kom's achievements as he was unaware of her existence. Quadras later approached Kumar with the script for Mary Kom and he decided to make his directorial debut with it. Quadras, who was interested in sports, started writing the screenplay for the film in 2011, which took two years to complete. Quadras arranged a meeting with Kom via her manager in the year he started writing the script. Kumar went to Manipur to meet Kom and seek her permission to make the film. Initially, Kom was surprised by the development as the sport, especially women's boxing, was not well known in India. However, she was enthusiastic about the idea. Research for the film was done through available sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos played a key role in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. Karan Singh Rathore Ramendra Vashishth wrote the dialogues. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract for the film was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics. Nevertheless, the film took several cinematic liberties for dramatic effects. In a 2012 meeting with Bhansali, Kumar told him about the film; he explained that this was a kind of cinema contrary to Bhansali's signature work. Still, Bhansali wanted to hear the story and was also enthusiastic towards the project. After hearing the script, he liked it and immediately agreed to produce the film. Viacom18 Motion Pictures and Bhansali, Under his production company Bhansali Productions came together to produce the film. However, Kumar's colleagues were not sure if a film based in Manipur would be well received by the audience. This concern evaporated after the 2012 Summer Olympics, where Kom won a bronze medal. Her win also highlighted her previous achievements. After the news of the development of the film broke in the media, the makers clarified that the film was in development since 2011, much before the Olympics, and they were not influenced by her recent success. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Bhansali described the film as a \\"rare experiment\\", for the fact that \\"Not many films are based on biopics of living people\\" and expressed his pride about his association with the project, adding that the story was so inspiring, it touched his heart. = Casting and characters = Chopra was Kumar's and Bhansali's first choice for the title role. In early November 2012, media reports suggested that Chopra entered negotiations to star in the film, which she denied initially. Later in that month, it was confirmed that she had been cast for the part. She was initially skeptical about the film due to the demanding nature of the character, which included training, muscle building, and learning the sport. She later agreed to the film because of Kumar's confidence in her. The casting was debated, with the makers receiving criticism for choosing a North Indian in the role of a North-East Indian instead of an actress who looks like Kom from that region. The director felt that the film needed a big star with a wider reach and casting an unknown actress from that region would have made the film smaller in scope and lessened its reach, and thus defeating his purpose of telling Kom's story to a larger audience. The makers of the film revealed that Chopra was cast because of her bankability and reach among the audiences, with Kumar saying \\"I not only needed a capable actress but also someone who can connect with millions of viewers\\". Mary Kom defended Chopra's casting and thought of Chopra as the \\"perfect choice\\" for the role. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Kom described Chopra as the best actress to play the role, adding that her body was well structured, like that of a boxer. In contrast, it took the casting directors Shruti Mahajan and Paragg Mehta several months of auditions to finalise the appropriate supporting actors for the film. In May 2013, a wide section of the media reported that Danny Denzongpa was approached to play Kom's coach Narjit Singh in the film. Instead, Sunil Thapa was cast for the role of Kom's coach. Darshan Kumar was finalised as Kom's husband, footballer Onler Kom, after a series of auditions which included three different looks representing three different stages in his life. Robin Das, a National School of Drama professor, was cast in the role of Kom's father. Kom and Chopra at the music release of the film Before filming began, Chopra prepared for three months. The preparations included building the physique of a boxer and learning the sport. Samir Jaura was brought in to train Chopra. At that time, she was busy dubbing for Krrish 3 (2013), and filming for Gunday (2014). It was then decided that Jaura would accompany her to film shoots, so that continuity in training could be maintained. Though he did not get a chance to meet Kom, he used her videos to study her body language and prepare a workout plan for Chopra, who started training in April 2013. She found it hard to train vigorously to attain a boxer's physique. She was put on a low-carb, high-protein diet. \\"As a girl it was very difficult to build those muscles. I had to build in three months what Mary did in 15 years\\", she said in an interview with Deccan Chronicle. Chopra got a fifteen-day break from her other commitments to train for the film. She relocated to her bungalow in Goa, where she would train for five hours a day. After completing workouts, which included weights and circuit training, she insisted on training for boxing. Later, boxing was made a part of her daily workout. She was trained by Kom's coaches to learn her distinct boxing style. Chopra explained that she did not have to act like a boxer, but had to become one and said \\"To learn boxing was a religion. Today, I can play the sport as I know the rules, body posture, foot work, I can hit, I can defend. I know the game.\\" Chopra found Mary Kom a very special and personal film due to the inspiring story, adding that she pushed herself to do justice to the role. She revealed that she channeled the grief of her father's death into the film: \\"I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it.\\" In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she did not try to imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, \\"When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family – basically she got to know aspects of my family life.\\" To get Kom's Hindi and Manipuri accents right, Chopra listened to the taped conversations of the boxer. Darshan Kumar described his character as an \\"encouraging husband\\", who is the pillar of strength in Kom's life. He found the character challenging due to contrasting personalities. Unlike Chopra, Kumar did not meet Onler Kom before the film. He mainly made use of the videos which Kom had provided to the makers, which helped him understand the nuances of his character. For the role, he had to learn the Manipuri accent, which was difficult for him being a Haryanvi. Kumar lost 12 kilogram to look the part, and followed a strict, grilled chicken and oil-free fish protein diet for three months. = Pre-production = The production design was handled by Kumar's wife Vanita. After plans to shoot in Manipur were dropped because of safety concerns, extensive research was done to find locations similar to Manipur. Their search ended in Himachal Pradesh, Manali, where a major portion of the state was recreated. Vanita used a real structure instead of a set to show Kom's childhood home in Kangathei. She recreated the look and feel of Manipur in Dharamshala and Manali. During the search, Vanita found two houses that were similar to those where Kom spent her childhood and lived after her marriage. For authenticity, the house was filled with items similar to those found at Kom's house such as indigenous short stools and woven curtains sourced from Manipur. Since Kom has a separate trophy room where all her awards are kept, a similar room was created. Quotes from the Bible were added on the walls. A 19th-century church in Dharamshala was chosen for the wedding sequence. Vanita noted that \\"the cinematic realism, was a different experience from the grandeur of Bhansali's sets.\\" However, she found it difficult to recreate the run-down gym where Kom was trained. A place was chosen with minimal facilities and water leaking onto the walls. She revealed that the sets had to feel authentic rather than artificially created. The costumes were designed by Isha Mantry and Rajat Tangri. Tangri visited Manipur to study fabric used in local clothing. Tangri used photographs from Kom's childhood to create clothing which ranged from traditional to sporty and athletic attires. For Kom's wedding sequence in the film, Tangri created an exact replica of her wedding gown. Hollywood-based Mark Garbarino was Chopra's makeup artist. At first, they wanted her to look exactly like Kom by using prosthetic makeup. Chopra did a prosthetic test in the United States which included heavier eyelids for a more East-Asian look. However, the final result did not appeal to the makers. Also, the prosthetic would not hold during filming of the heavy-action boxing scenes. It was later reported that Chopra's look would be created post production by using visual effects. However, the results were unsatisfactory and hence this idea was also dropped. Chopra said \\"We tried a bunch of stuff – Visual effects, prosthetics, makeup, [but] it looked too gimmicky. That's when we decided to go with just carrying the essence of the film, rather than the outer, cosmetic part.\\" Later, Uday Shirali, Chopra's makeup artist since Agneepath (2012), was hired. For creating boxing scars, makeup artist Subhash Shinde was employed. His biggest challenges were to make the fight marks look as realistic as possible as it required a lot of time and detailing. He stated, \\"Every punch or scar needed to look real, change colour and age with time on screen, and shouldn't look like they were created using makeup.\\" He did some research by visiting hospitals to understand more about skin injuries. Rohit Kulkarni composed the background score. = Filming = The film was extensively shot in Manali Principal photography began on 17 June 2013 at Filmistan, Mumbai. The media reports suggested that, with sets ready and Chopra already training, the filming was supposed to start earlier at Filmistan, but following actress' father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold for a while. Bhansali had told Chopra that the filming could wait and to take some time off in the wake of her father's loss; however, the actress insisted on starting the filming immediately. Cinematographer Keiko Nakahara used a hand-held camera during the shooting of the film. Sports coordinator Robert Miller was hired to choreograph the fight sequences. Miller roped in Christy Halbert, the Unites States's assistant coach at the London Olympics, to help choreograph the fight scenes. To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes. Initially, the makers had planned to use actors and teach them boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised that it would not be feasible and would be time-consuming. They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes was difficult for Chopra as she got hurt several times; she says, \\"They are real boxers and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to really hit you. So I had to get hit a lot and that was really hard.\\" The second schedule commenced in Manali in late March 2014, after Chopra finished her other film commitments. Before filming, Chopra had to re-train herself to build muscles. Bhansali planned an elaborate over a month long schedule for her, which ensured that her physicality and agility were suitable enough for the role. While filming a sequence in a marketplace, more than ten thousand people gathered on the sets. Due to limited security arrangements, the crowds became uncontrollable in what was not believed to be a heavily populated area. When Chopra stepped out of her van, some fans tried to approach her, causing the general loss of control. As a result, the shoot was cancelled and the whole crew had to leave. Filming in Manali continued till early April 2014, before shifting to Dharamshala. While filming fight sequence in Dharamshala, Chopra suffered an eye injury, which the makeup team exaggerated for effect. The filming in Dharamshala continued till 19 April 2014. The filming was done in 57 days over the course of two years. Rajesh G. Pandey edited the film with Bhansali.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack of the film consists of seven original songs composed by duo Shashi Suman and Shivam, with lyrics by Prashant Ingole and Sandip Ssingh. Vocals were performed by Vishal Dadlani, Arijit Singh, Sunidhi Chauhan, Mohit Chauhan, Salim Merchant and Priyanka Chopra. Chopra made her Hindi playback singing debut with a lullaby, \\"Chaoro\\". The soundtrack was released by Zee Music on 13 August 2014. The song \\"Salaam India\\" was the official song at the 2014 Asian Games, held in South Korea. The Times of India noted that the soundtrack is both, \\"inspirational and soul-stirring\\", describing the opening track \\"Ziddi Dil\\" as a \\"clear winner that could lift anyone's spirits in a time of distress.\\" Bollywood Hungama gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, and said that the composers did justice to the theme of the film. Rediff.com's Joginder Tuteja called the compositions \\"motivational\\", and wrote that \\"Mary Kom's soundtrack may not be an instant chart-buster, but it holds its own.\\" The Financial Express review stated that the risk of recruiting newcomers to compose the soundtrack paid off, concluding, \\"Although the album does not deliver an instant chartbuster, it does have well composed numbers which are hummable.\\" The review praised the singing of the artists on the album. Like Tuteja, the review noted that Chopra sang the lullaby with \\"great emotions\\".  Marketing and release  CEO of Viacom 18 Motion Pictures Ajit Andhare, Bhansali, Chopra, and Kumar at the trailer launch of Mary Kom Mary Kom was one of the highly anticipated films of 2014. The first poster for the film was revealed on 14 July 2014 by Chopra through her Twitter account. It portrayed a muscular Chopra as Mary Kom in sports clothing, with her hair tied in a pony tail, punching a bag. It received positive feedback from film critics, industry professionals, and audiences alike. Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times noted that \\"with well-built muscles and a completely toned body, Priyanka looks fierce.\\" The poster went viral on social media, with the hashtag \\"#MaryKomFirstLook\\" trending in India and worldwide. The following day, Chopra tweeted another poster for the film; a motion poster was released on the same day. The first teaser with the tagline \\"Most Champions Make Their Name. She Made History\\" was released on Chopra's birthday (18 July). With the interest generated by these reveals, the trailer release was highly anticipated, with media reporting that it would be unveiled on 24 July. However, it was released the day before at an event on 23 July and generated interest in the audience, media and critics. On 27 August, a special screening was held for selected members of media, trade and critics, where 20 minutes of raw footage from the film was previewed, creating a positive buzz. Mary Kom herself (along with her husband) attended few promotional events of the film. As part of their promotional strategy, Bhansali Productions released a doll, which looked like Chopra as Kom. The film was originally scheduled for release on 2 October (on Gandhi Jayanti), however, it was announced that the film was postponed to an uncertain date to revamp the film to feature more events surrounding Kom's life. After the uncertainty of a release date for a month, it was announced that the film would be released on 5 September (Teacher's Day), clashing with Daawat-e-Ishq, which starred Chopra's cousin, Parineeti. Yash Raj Films requested that Bhansali shift the release date, which he refused due to previous release date changes of the film and the ongoing promotional activities. Later, Yash Raj Films postponed the Daawat-e-Ishq release date by two weeks. On 4 September, Mary Kom had its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, where it became the first Hindi film to be screened on the opening night of the film festival. It was released in 1500 screens worldwide. The film was released in overseas markets by Eros International as part of a four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general entertainment channel Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her own state would not be able to see her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the only option for native people to watch the film. Made on a budget of 180 million including production, prints and advertising, and marketing, Mary Kom earned 200 million, and before release recouped more than its cost from brand tie-ups. The film made profits before the release. Partnership was arranged in a way that the products from brands were either showcased in the film or the brands promoted the film in their advertising. The satellite rights of the film were sold for 140 million and music rights for 30 million. The film was released in DVDs on 15 October 2014 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained behind-the-scene footage and deleted scenes. The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time. The Mary Kom Blu-ray is the first Blu-ray title in India to feature a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.  Reception  = Critical reception = Chopra received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Mary Kom The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with Chopra receiving critical acclaim for her performance. Subhash K. Jha awarded the film 5 stars out of 5, describing it as \\"a motivational masterpiece\\" and said \\"From first frame to last it grips your senses and irrigates the parched corridors of your heart like very few bio-pics in recent times. [...] a work that is as dramatic as Mehboob's Mother India and as inspiring as Attenborough's Gandhi.\\" Jha lauded Chopra's transformation into Kom and noted her for expressing every shade of the character with a \\"pitch-perfect\\" bravado. Rediff.com rated the film 4.5 out of 5, noting it as a victory for its protagonist Chopra, scriptwriter Saiwyn Quadras, and director Omung Kumar and wrote \\"Mary's story is delivered with a sincerity that makes it irresistible.\\" Sonia Chopra from Sify described the film as a \\"thrilling ringside view\\", saying that \\"Mary Kom is an important film that's hugely inspiring. But more importantly, it's also great fun to watch.\\" The reviewer singled out Chopra's performance, writing \\"Priyanka Chopra, transformed into Mary Kom, to give us this year's most earnest, memorable performance thus far!\\" The Times of India gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5 calling it as Bollywood's answer to Academy Award-winning film Million Dollar Baby (2004). Bollywood Hungama gave it 4 stars, stating that the film \\"will surely go down in the history of exemplary biopics on Indian celluloid.\\" The review noted the technical aspects of the film such as the cinematography, costumes, background score which \\"overshadowed\\" the film's soundtrack and the \\"crisp\\" editing. Namrata Joshi from Outlook rated the film with 3 stars out of 4 and commented on the simple, unpretentious storyline that dramatised important events from the champion's life, complimenting Chopra's \\"sincere and earnest\\" performance. The Economic Times gave a rating of 4 stars out of 5, noting that the film is well on its way to being one of the most praised sports-based films since Chak De India and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and wrote \\"This is one of those boxing movies which is much more than boxing. It takes you to a place which is beyond ruptured cheeks, cracked jaws, and fractured ribs of the protagonist.\\" Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra rated the film 3 out of 5, noting it as a \\"worthy attempt\\", saying that the film had sincerity and was crafted with care, but criticised the screenplay which she thought was limited to \\"ticking off milestones\\" of Kom's career. She felt that the film was powered by Chopra's \\"remarkable\\" performance. Mayank Shekhar also rated the film with 3 stars, stating that his biggest concern before getting into the film was that the film-makers (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) would excessively \\"Bollywood-ise\\" Kom's story. He commented that this fear was \\"thankfully\\" not found. Rajeev Masand remarked that the film was \\"perfectly watchable, but never great like it should've been\\", criticising the \\"bland\\" script and wrote \\"the film ticks off each of Mary Kom's career achievements and key personal struggles, but doesn't tell you much more about her as a person.\\" Masand was impressed by Chopra's performance noting that the actress \\"transforms herself physically, and also skillfully conveys both the rage and vulnerability that the part required.\\" Sudhish Kamath from The Hindu thought that the script was generic and predictable, and the plot was actually manipulative. However, Kamath felt that the film should be watched for Chopra who gave a \\"knockout\\" performance, writing \\"The spirited actress rises above the material and makes us invest in her. She owns the film and does full justice to the spirit of the world champion, making all that criticism about her casting irrelevant.\\" On the contrary, Business Standard criticised the film for not showing enough about boxing in general rather than Kom in particular. It stated that \\"while Mary Kom is entertaining, it should have aspired to be more.\\" Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express gave a rating of 2.5, noting that the \\"Film gets bloated by extraneous songs\\", and criticised the product placements calling them a \\"distraction from the story.\\" The India Today reviewer, Rohit Khilnani, criticised Kumar's direction and wrote \\"The story is predictable from the word go and there are absolutely no surprise elements. A lot could have been done with such a strong protagonist but the director doesn't experiment.\\" = Box office = On its opening day, the film earned 85 million, marking the biggest opening collection for a women-centric film. Following the positive word of mouth, Saturday collections showed a growth of 20% from Friday and went on to collect 90 million. The collection on Sunday showed an additional 20% growth from Saturday, earning approximately 110 million. The film collected 275 million net over its first weekend.

She was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates and Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, leader of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and Maryland League of Women Voters, and held positions within the Social Security Administration. Engle was born in Forest Glen, Maryland, to Quakers James Melvin Engle, a Treasury Department official, and Lavinia Hauke Engle, who was an active suffragette. Lavinia Hauke Engle was the first president of the Montgomery League of Women Voters and a frequent speaker at women's clubs in Maryland. She testified before Congress for women's suffrage with Susan B. Anthony. Lavinia Margaret Engle earned a BA from Antioch College in 1912. She would later return to school as the first female graduate student in political science at The Johns Hopkins University. After completing her BA, she joined the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), where she became a suffrage campaign coordinator. She traveled extensively in the South and was particularly active in organizing the suffrage association in South Carolina. In 1919, she participated in the suffrage march in Washington, D.C. down Pennsylvania Avenue, which was met with violent opposition. After passage of the 19th Amendment, Engle advocated for the continued need for groups advocating women's suffrage rights. After the dissolution of the NAWSA, Engle became a leader of the League of Women Voters. From 1921 to 1936 she served as executive director of the Maryland League of Women Voters. During this time, she pushed for legislation including the Juvenile Court Act, the establishment of a State Department of Infant and Maternal Hygiene, the establishment of the Commission on Almshouses, and the reorganization of the Board of State Aid to Charities. She served on the Commission on Reorganization of the State Administrative Departments in 1921 and the State Commission on Higher Education in 1930. In 1930, she ran for the Maryland House of Delegates from Montgomery County and won a seat. During her one term in office, she helped pass the Marriage Bill and introduced legislation for unemployment insurance. In 1936, she left her post at the Maryland League of Women Voters and was appointed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to the Social Security Administration, where she served until her retirement in 1966. She first acted as an educational representative, traveling the country to speak at college campuses and women's boards, but was soon promoted to Chief of Field Operations. In 1942, she was appointed Director of Region III, and in 1951, she became Assistant to the Commissioner of Social Security in charge of staff development. In 1963, she joined the Welfare Administration.

Financial Post, May 1, 2014. George Skleres from Riot Games and Colleen Macklin star in the film, both of whom appeared at the GaymerX convention, a prominent topic. History The film was funded on Kickstarter in May 2013, with 1,026 backers, pledging $51,158.Gaming In Color The successful Kickstarter campaign came after an initial campaign seeking $125,000 was cancelled.Gaming In Color Kickstarter Relaunches The new campaign noted that resources had been donated and the film's crew had changed, so the new campaign reflected an adjusted budget of $50,000. It was filmed throughout 2013, conducting individual interviews as well as shooting a great amount of GaymerX in August.Gaming In Color Documentary Kickstarter Launches The crew worked to include varied stories and experiences that fell into the same broad category. Later in 2013, the film was acquired by MidBoss who completed the filming, editing, and all post- production, releasing it on their own. On April 22, 2014, Gaming In Color released for digital sales on their VHX distribution page. Throughout the year, the film screened at game conventions, festivals, queer events, universities, and tech camps worldwide, including events at MIT, UC Berkeley, and GaymerX2.

Sexuality in culture bridges the gap to sexuality in games, to make room for the topic of non-traditional sexualities and expressions being a part of culture, and thus video games. Hate speech and bigotry are common in online spaces, and how that affects people personally when they play games is commented on. Solutions to harmful activity is postulated, and many point to the GaymerX convention for doing good work in creating a safe space in adding visibility, to influence a more open-minded gaming community, as well as more LGBTQ characters in mainstream games. The film also stars Naomi Clark (game creator), Joey Stern (Geeks OUT organizer), Shane Cherry (NYC Gaymers promoter), Jessica Vazquez (games journalist), and Matthew Michael Brown (“Gaymer” of The Tester, Season 2 winner). Everyone in the main cast either identifies as LGBTQ, and/or active in gay gaming work of some kind.

In 2013, he became the first openly gay mountaineer to scale the Seven Summits. Early life Crane is the oldest of five children born to David W. Crane, the president of NRG Energy, and Isabella de la Houssaye, an international lawyer, in Mercer County, New Jersey. He lived in Hong Kong between the ages of one and six before returning to Lawrenceville, New Jersey. His younger brother Oliver Crane is an American adventurer and rower. =Education= Crane attended Princeton Day School through his eighth grade year, along with the rest of his siblings. In 2011, he graduated from Choate Rosemary Hall, a private boarding school in Connecticut, where he competed in a number of sports. He came out as gay at the age of 14; both his parents and his school were supportive, although he experienced bullying by classmates on occasion. After deferring for two years to travel to Lebanon and Israel and climb the Seven Summits, Crane joined the Princeton University Class of 2017, majoring in history. Mountain climbing Crane summited his first mountain, Mount Kilimanjaro, as a 15-year-old freshman in high school with his mother. He described it as a \\"gateway mountain\\" which piqued his interest in mountaineering. As a junior, following the suicides of Tyler Clementi and one of Crane's friends, he was inspired to raise awareness about suicide among LGBT youth through mountain climbing. This led him to start the Rainbow Summits Project, with the goal of climbing the Seven Summits—the highest mountains of each continent—in order to raise funds and awareness for the Trevor Project. By the beginning of 2013, a year after starting the Rainbow Summits Project, Crane had successfully climbed five of the Seven Summits: Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Elbrus in Russia, Cerro Aconcagua in Argentina, Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia and Vinson Massif in Antarctica. In May 2013, he reached the summit of Mount Everest in Nepal, guided by New Zealand climber Lydia Bradey, the first woman to summit Everest without using supplemental oxygen. Crane's successful ascent of Mount McKinley in July 2013 at the age of 20 marked his completion of the Seven Summits, making him the first openly gay man to have done so. By the completion of the project, Crane had raised US$135,000 for the Trevor Project.

It aired on 12 March 2014 on BBC Two. The episode was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, and stars Shearsmith, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Helen McCrory, Poppy Rush and Sean Buckley. While comedic in places, \\"The Harrowing\\" makes extensive use of gothic horror elements transmuted into a modern context. The plot follows Katy (Edwards), who has been hired to housesit for eccentric siblings Hector (Shearsmith) and Tabitha (McCrory). They rarely leave the house, but have an event to attend. They tell Katy about their bedridden, disabled brother Andras (Buckley), who cannot speak but will ring a bell if he needs assistance. Katy is joined by her friend Shell (Rush) once Hector and Tabitha leave, and, upon hearing Andras's bell, the pair reluctantly head upstairs. The episode takes place in Hector and Tabitha's mansion, which is kept deliberately cold and filled with paintings depicting Hell. The writers experimented with a variety of possible endings, hoping to make the episode's close both interesting and scary. Critics agreed that the episode was the most gothic and scary of the series, with journalists writing for The Sunday Times saying that \\"The Harrowing\\" would be best avoided by those of a nervous disposition. Critics writing in the Metro felt that the episode was a poor finale for the series, and that the episode's ending was unsatisfying. By contrast, Alex Hoskins, writing for the Cheddar Valley Gazette, felt the episode's ending was very strong, and Bruce Dessau described \\"The Harrowing\\" as an excellent end to the series. On an Empire Online list, \\"The Harrowing\\", particularly its final scene, was selected as the 17th best TV moment of the year. The episode was watched by 833,000 people on its first showing, which was 4.7% of the audience. Production Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had previously worked together on The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from \\"David and Maureen\\", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville. This episode, in turn, was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. \\"David and Maureen\\" took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a \\"reaction\\" to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that \\"We'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week.\\" As an anthology series with horror themes, Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. As the format of Inside No. 9 requires new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. \\"The Harrowing\\" starred Aimee- Ffion Edwards as Katy, Helen McCrory as Tabitha, Shearsmith as Hector, Poppy Rush as Shell and Sean Buckley as Andras. \\"The Harrowing\\" was the only episode in the series in which Pemberton did not star; Shearsmith played a character in all but \\"Last Gasp\\".See  * * Comedy critic Bruce Dessau noted that Shearsmith's role was actually relatively minor, saying that the house was the real star. Pemberton and Shearsmith are fans of classic horror films, and the episode displays inspiration from the likes of Alfred Hitchcock's filmography and the Hammer Horror films. Pemberton called the episode the \\"most genre\\" of the series, while Shearsmith described it as their attempt to produce a \\"full on ... gothic horror-esque\\" episode. The writers utilised the horror norm of a gothic mansion rather than bringing horror into a normal home. This route, Shearsmith suggested, has now become atypical. The setting allowed the writers to mix modern elements with traditional gothic horror, sometimes for comedic effect (a reference to \\"something called broadbands\\"), and sometimes to add to the horror (mobile phones cannot be used, as the characters are in a \\"dead zone\\"). While the writers did want the episode grounded in reality, they also wanted to make more use of gothic horror tropes than they had in other episodes of Inside No. 9. \\"The Harrowing\\" was advertised with a poster homage to classic horror films. The poster was designed by Graham Humphreys, a graphic designer known for his work on horror film posters. The episode's name was taken from the Harrowing of Hell, the story of Jesus Christ's descent to Hell in Christian theology. The character Katy is initially hired to babysit, though it turns out that there is no baby. Previous horror films, including When a Stranger Calls, have made use of a babysitter as a plot device, and an urban legend involves a babysitter downstairs with a threat upstairs. Both the viewer and the babysitter learn about the environment together, with both beginning in a position of ignorance. For Pemberton, the device works because the character has been moved from a safe environment into the unknown. In \\"The Harrowing\\", he suggests, it is obvious that there is something in the bedroom. The writers experimented with different endings, in an attempt to make the bedroom's contents interesting and genuinely scary. Plot Katy has been hired to take care of Hector and Tabitha's mansion while the two go out for the evening. They usually never leave the house, but have a rare event to attend. Tabitha greets Katy at the door and explains that the house is always kept at −3 °C as Hector and Tabitha's disabled brother, Andras, needs the air to be at this temperature. The paintings on the house's walls depict the Harrowing of Hell. After meeting Hector, Katy is disturbed by Tabitha's descriptions of Andras, who, it is claimed, does not have a mouth. He instead keeps a bell, which he never uses, beside his bed. Katy is told not to go upstairs. Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, especially when she finds a stuffed cat on the sofa. She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does not look disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him. Katy and Shell explore and enter Hector's bedroom, where they find a circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's deformed body is revealed; he is tied to the bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons. Tabitha and Hector prepare to inject Katy with a sedative, but she fights back. She runs downstairs only to find that the door is locked. Shell arrives and says that Katy cannot escape. Shell says she wanted to be Castiel's new human host, but she is too weak, whereas Katy has the strength of character needed to keep the demon contained. Shell injects Katy, who collapses. Upstairs, Hector strips Katy to her bra and knickers and ties her to a chair as well as gagging her, while Shell feeds Andras his \\"last supper\\": rusks and baby milk, the only food he can manage. Hector, Tabitha and Shell leave Katy to become acquainted with Castiel, who, they say, will possess her as Andras dies. Andras advances on Katy. As she screams, Andras repeatedly says: \\"Mischief!\\" Reception Critics variously called \\"The Harrowing\\" the \\"nastiest\\", \\"most Gothic\\" and most horrorific episode of Inside No. 9. It was described as \\"unashamedly macabre\\" by Metro journalists, \\"genuinely frightening\\" by David Upton of PopMatters, and \\"a genuine fright fest\\" by Dessau. Despite both reviews characterising \\"The Harrowing\\" as one of the weaker episodes of the series, it was called \\"very creepy\\" in the Liverpool Echo, and the closing scene was described as extremely scary in the Metro. Critics writing for The Sunday Times said that the episode \\"really is best avoided by those of a nervous disposition\\", and the sentiment was echoed in the Cheddar Valley Gazette, where it was suggested that the character of Andras \\"certainly warranted the warning of disturbing scenes\\" given before the episode. Concerning the comedic elements of \\"The Harrowing\\", Sunday Times critics said that \\"comedy doesn't come blacker than this\\". Jack Seale, of the Radio Times, said that viewers would \\"marvel at how [the writers could] pepper the elegant script with gags without breaking the spell\\". Dessau also felt that the script was \\"great\\", and commented on a \\"particularly pithy\\" joke, \\"just when you least expect it\\". Nick Rutherford and Keith Watson, writing for the Metro, downplayed the comedy of the episode, saying that \\"the odd defiantly bad joke ... pierced the darkness\\". They felt that \\"The Harrowing\\" was a weak instalment of Inside No. 9, giving it three out of five stars. The ending, these critics suggested, was \\"a bit of a cop out\\" rather than \\"daring\\". For them, unlike in other Inside No. 9 scripts, there was no twist. Alex Hoskins, writing for the Cheddar Valley Gazette, acknowledged that the \\"ending will most likely have sparked an online outcry\\", but felt that \\"it was fantastic, fearless and a perfect end to [the] series\\". Dessau shared a positive view, saying that the series ended \\"on an absolute high\\", with one of his favourite episodes. =Viewership and recognition= \\"The Harrowing\\" was watched by 833,000 people, which was 4.7% of the audience. This was a recovery from the series low of the previous week's \\"The Understudy\\", but was fewer viewers than any of the first four episodes. The average viewing figures for the series were 904,000 people, or 4.9% of the audience, lower than the slot average of 970,000 (5.1% of the audience). Due in part to her appearance in the episode, Edwards was shortlisted for WalesOnline's \\"Daffta\\" award for best actress, but lost in the public vote to Eve Myles. For Hallowe'en 2014, ezine Den of Geek listed \\"31 scary TV episodes that truly terrified us\\". Phoebe-Jane Boyd selected \\"The Harrowing\\", commenting on its divergence from previous episodes of Inside No. 9 and the clash of humour and horror tropes. Describing the character of Andras, she explained that \\"Seeing him jerkily moving towards [Katy] with glee, hissing 'mischief'...' straight into camera, is shocking, unexpected, and above all, just horrible.\\" \\"The Harrowing\\", particularly its final scene, was selected as Empire Online's 17th greatest television moment of 2014. \\"Though there are dark laughs in the episode\\", it was claimed on the website, \\"the ending is pure nightmare fodder, the babysitter helpless as a Castiel- possessed man advances, hissing, 'Mischief!' Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, we both salute you and request you contribute to our therapy bills\\".

Waldy, was an Indonesian stage and film actor. Biography Waldy was born in Blitar, in Java, on 15 December 1919 and was one of fourteen children born to J. R. Hunter (also known as Osman) and L. W. Winterberg who were of English and German descent, respectively. Both were stage actors with the Sri Permata Opera, and often traveled. Interested in theatre, he ran away from his elementary school in Yogyakarta to join a troupe in Klaten, under the leadership of Djafar Wirjo. Although Waldy was taken as a porter, Wirjo taught him stage techniques as well. Waldy's parents ultimately decided to support his career and help him learn to lead a cabaret. In the early 1930s, Waldy joined a variety of troupes, including Faroka Opera and Grand Nooran Opera. He toured the Maritime Southeast Asia, reaching Siam and the Malay Peninsula, and further refined his craft with the input of actors such as Rd Ismail. In 1938, he attempted to establish his own troupe. Named Vaudeville, it was unsuccessful and quickly folded. In 1940, Waldy was approached to act in Zoebaida, a film directed by Njoo Cheong Seng for Oriental Film. He accepted the role, and also served as songwriter for the film. Over the next three years he took a variety of film roles for Star Film, including Ajah Berdosa, Lintah Darat, Tjioeng Wanara, and Pah Wongso Tersangka (all 1941). After the Japanese occupation began in March 1942, most studios were closed. Waldy migrated back to the stage, first joining Djawa Baru before establishing his own troupe, starring Dewi Mada. By the mid-1940s he had met Sofia, an actress with the Fifi Young troupe; the two were married by 1948. Feature film production in the Indies recommenced in 1948, amidst the Indonesian National Revolution, a military and political conflict between the newly proclaimed Republic of Indonesia and the returning Dutch colonial forces. Waldy and Sofia joined Tan & Wong Bros. and made their debut together in Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum; for this film, Waldy again took the role of songwriter. Film scholar Ekky Imanjaya writes that Tan & Wong Bros attempted to cash in on the success of their previous incarnation, Tan's Film. Sofia was advertised based on her resemblance to Tan's star Roekiah, and Waldy bore a physical resemblance to Roekiah's husband, the comedian Kartolo. This was followed by several further films, including Bengawan Solo (1949) and Air Mata Pengantin (1952). By 1950's Tirtonadi, Waldy had begun to have a behind the scenes role, serving as cinematographer. In 1953, beginning with Musafir Kelana, Tan & Wong put Waldy in charge of their subsidiary, Ardjuna Film, and he began to direct regularly – though often taking acting roles in the films he directed. His most active year was 1954 during which he appeared in five films. A 1955 article in Doenia Film credited Waldy with the discovery of several rising stars, including Elly Joenara, Zainal Abidin, and Sukarno M. Noor. Waldy and Sofia divorced in 1964. The actress remarried quickly, to WD Mochtar. Waldy married Elviana, who took his name, becoming Elviana Waldy. He died four years later, in 1968.

Early life Charles Fitzsimmons was born in 1802 in County Cavan, Ireland, the son of James Fitzsimmons and his wife Margaret (née Lynch). Politics Fitzsimmons was elected as Member for Port Curtis in the Queensland Legislative Assembly at the inaugural colonial election on 4 May 1860. He held that seat until he resigned on 3 September 1861; Alfred Sandeman won the resulting by-election on 15 October 1861. Under the Additional Members Act 1864, the seats of Clermont, Kennedy, Maryborough, Mitchell, Rockhampton and Warrego were created. By-elections were held to fill the new seats on 18 March 1865. Fitzsimmons was elected in Rockhampton. He held the seat until the 1867 election on 27 June at which he did not contest the seat, saying he desired to retire from public life. However, he did contest the seat of electoral district of Clermont in the same election, and it was speculated that he had been pressured to stand aside in Rockhampton to allow Archibald Archer to be elected there. However, Thomas Henry Fitzgerald won the election in Rockhampton, but resigned immediately as he wanted to contest the electoral district of Kennedy instead. Archer won the resulting by-election in Rockhampton on 27 July 1867 unopposed. Fitzsimmons won the election in Clermont on 1 July 1867 and represented that seat until he resigned on 11 May 1868. Later life Fitzsimmons died on 24 February 1876 at Nebia Plantation, Mackay, Queensland, following several weeks of prostration due to old age.

Analysis Curved screens are marketed as providing an \\"immersive\\" experience, and allowing a wider field of view. Similar to a movie theater having good and bad seats, there is an optimal position when it comes to watching TV at home. This optimal position is directly along the central axis of the TV with the central point of the screen at eye level. Viewers seated in any other position come to experience degradations in picture quality ranging anywhere from minor to severe, the most notable being trapezoidal distortion. Manufacturers suggest that curved screens allow greater range in satisfactory viewing angles and offer minimal trapezoidal distortion compared to flat- screens. The claim that curved screens provide a wider field view is disputed, by another claim that a substantial offset from the center provides greater viewing distortion than that of a flat screen. However, the equidistant claim by manufacturers of the various parts of the screen from a centered view is supported. Curved TVs supposedly offer minimized glare from ambient light. Applications To reduce outer edge distortions and provide a panoramic view, large curved screens accomplish this free of bezel lines framing each screen, and the alternative was to use multiple flat-screen monitors around the viewer. Curved screens and multi-screens have applications in gaming. Backward curved screens have the potential to be used as digital signage that can be installed at various locations to produce marketing exposure. =Projection screens= When projecting images onto a completely flat screen, the distance light has to travel from its point of origin (i.e., the projector) increases the farther away the destination point is from the screen's center. This variance in the distance traveled results in a distortion phenomenon known as the pincushion effect, where the image at the left and right edges of the screen becomes bowed inwards and stretched vertically, making the entire image appear blurry. Curved screens are also widely used in IMAX and standard movie theaters for their ability to produce natural expressions and draw the audience deeper into the scene. A standard IMAX screen is 22m wide and 16m tall, but there are screens with even larger dimensions. IMAX is the most successful large-format, specialized cinematic- film system. =Touch on curved screen= One of the issues in the use of the curved screen in commercial electronics is how accurately it can work with a touch-sensor. To drive the solution, LG electronics has developed Infrared- based touch solutions for the curved display. History The world's first curved screen was the Cinerama, which debuted in New York in 1952. Countless theaters, including the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood began to use horizontally curved screens to counter image distortions associated with super-wide formats such as 23:9 CinemaScope. Cinerama-project Screen 21:9 aspect ratio monitors were developed to display the maximum amount of information on a single screen, but the extreme wideness of the screen created severe distortions on the left and right edges of the screen. Curved 21:9 monitors were then developed to address this issue and provide a distortion-free, wide-angle viewing environment. Manufacturing process The first curved panels were produced by bending flat panels that had already been manufactured. This technique resulted in performance issues, such as oval mura (a clouding effect) and color mixture (which causes color impurity and image distortion) observed at its curved edges. Since the introduction of flexible glass, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) can be applied to curved surfaces without bending existing panels. The screen technologies used to create curved LCD screens are Vertical Alignment, which helps to reduce any white glow that may affect an angular view, and IPS Panels, which are more susceptible to distortion.

Malcha Mahal, also known as Wilayat Mahal, is a Tughlak era hunting lodge in the Chanakyapuri area of New Delhi, India next to the Delhi Earth Station of the Indian Space Research Organisation. It was built by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, who reigned over the Sultanate of Delhi, in 1325. It came to be known as Wilayat Mahal after the self-proclaimed \\"Begum Wilayat Mahal\\" of Awadh, who claimed to be a member of the Royal family of Oudh who was reportedly given the place by the Government of India in May 1985. On 10 September 1993, Begum died by suicide at the age of 62. The descendants of Wazid Ali Shah in Lucknow claims that the family engaged in fraudulent activities, having been cited by an investigative journalist for the New York Times. The building is now mostly in ruins. After Wilayat's death, it continued to be inhabited by the Begum's daughter Sakina Mahal, and son Prince Ali Raza (aka Cyrus). Cyrus died in late 2017; his sister died some years before him, though the exact date is unknown. History Malcha Mahal is located in Malcha, one of the historical villages around Raisina Hill. Malcha, along with Raisina, Todapur, Aliganj, Pillanji, Jaisinghpura, and Kushak villages were moved by the British during the construction of capital New Delhi in the 1920s, especially the Viceroy's House, which is now known as the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Inhabitation by Wilayat Mahal Begum Wilayat Mahal, self-proclaimed great-granddaughter of the last Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah, was reportedly allotted the Mahal in May 1985, following the intervention of the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi in 1984. Begum Wilayat Mahal had been protesting for nine years by living in a waiting room at the New Delhi railway station, demanding compensation for the loss of her ancestral property in Awadh which was seized when Wajid Ali Shah's kingdom was annexed by the British. On 22 November 2019, the New England Bureau Chief of The New York Times, Ellen Barry, published a lengthy piece of investigative journalism in which she said she had discovered that Wilayat Khan, in fact, had no connection to the Awadh royal family. Rather, she was the widow of the former Registrar of Lucknow University, Inayatullah Butt. Barry found her oldest son, Shahid Butt, living in the UK and he had told her the true story.

Projects =Super Ventilator= A patient wearing the Super Ventilator, a low-cost first aid device Since 2015, Supervasi has been developing the Super Ventilator, which is an ultra low-cost mechanical ventilator, essential to many first-aid situations.Snakebite victims get lifeline in the form of mono- ambulances, portable ventilators (ePaper version), Times of India, May 30, 2014Super Ventilator, Supervasi The device is low-power and imitates natural breathing, and causes no harm or further illness to patients. It is an innovative non-invasive ventilator, useful for anyone with respiratory illnesses such as asthma or bronchitis, and even useful in cases of heart- attack, strokes, accidents, poisoning, etc. There is an acute shortage of mechanical ventilators in India; based on hospital-bed-to-ventilator statistics, India is short of one million mechanical ventilators. Ventilators are required in seven major departments like medicine, pediatrics, pediatric surgery, surgery, orthopedics, chest medicine and TB, ENT and gynecology. Compared to conventional mechanical ventilators that cost around 2.5 Million Indian Rupees (upwards of $20,000), the Super Ventilator costs just 25,000 Indian Rupees, making it affordable by all hospitals and villages. Also, conventional ventilators are often too complex and fragile for use in harsh rural environments. The goal of the device is \\"one ventilator per bed\\" in every hospital. =PACT Program= Tribal youth students learning 3D modeling within the PACT program. Since 2014, Supervasi has been training tribal youth in advanced computer skills and foreign languages, in a residential program known as Pratigya Apprenticeship for Community Transformation (PACT). In 2014, it started a pilot PACT center in Yeoor, Maharashtra. Apprentices are trained in computer software, graphic design, animation, and digitization of documents.For these girls, earning means helping their village, DNA India, 12 March 2014 Language experts also volunteer with the organization, to teach apprentices foreign languages like German and Arabic.आदिवासी मूली बोलणार परदेशी भाषा (Adivasi girls speak foreign languages), Pudhari Kolapur (पुढारी), 24 March 2014 The apprentices are also developing educational multimedia relevant for tribals, which will be used to provide free education for tribals across the India. The candidates also use their skills to train youth from their local villages, and help them earn a living. The trained apprentices are required to help the NGO in carrying out their snakebite project by distributing safety kits developed by it. =Snakeathon Project= The mono- wheel stretcher designed for off-road transport of snakebite victims In 2014, Supervasi developed innovative relief measures for victims of snakebite. The primary relief measure is a \\"mono-wheel ambulance\\" for areas that lack roads and vehicles, areas that are completely disconnected from the road network. The mono-wheel ambulance is a stretcher that can be carried or pulled by a bicycle, with an integrated portable ventilator to provide respiratory support to the victim. Its single-wheel design enables transport on rough and jungle terrain. The relief measures also include a first aid kit. The ambulance kit is to be distributed free of cost to over 300 jungle settlements by June 2014. Alt URL The mono-wheel ambulance is suited for rough and rocky terrain, and the portable low/no power ventilator can be used in villages with no electricity. 50% of snakebite cases in the world take place in India. In Thane district alone, snakebites claim up to 10 people a day, and in the monsoon season, the toll rises to 20. A close study of the deaths has shown that it was mostly the male members of the family who had died, bringing hardships to the family. Moreover, three of the four victims had died only because they were unable to reach a hospital in time due to lack of roads in rural areas. =Public Interest Litigation= In 2014, Dr. Sarita Parikh and Apoorva Agwan of Supervasi filed a Public Interest Litigation in the Bombay High Court, requesting removal of obstructions in distributing the free mono-wheel ambulance kit to tribal areas.50% of snakebite cases in the world take place in India, DNA India, Monday, 16 June 2014HC notice to Maharashtra government on relief for snake-bite victims, Times of India, Jun 9, 2014Will there be a new Emergency Medical Services Act in Maharashtra?, Moneylife Magazine, 16/10/2014 The petition urged for direction to the government to set up an emergency team to organise logistics and funding to help deliver snake-bite kits to all affected persons. The petition also stated that the organization was helping the tribals save their lives, and if an individual or an organisation hindered their life-saving work, it amounted to an offence under section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). In response, the High Court stated that it was \\"quite impressed by the research which has been done by Supervasi\\", and acknowledged that they had provided \\"statistical data about snakebites in Maharashtra and the other States in India\\" and that they gave \\"a definite proposal how this problem can be resolved\\". There has been resistance to their NGO work from Anantashram Trust and some adivasis, including an ex-sarpanch and a social worker. Alt URL The High Court directed the police in Thane, Maharashtra to ensure that members and apprentices of Supervasi are not obstructed by anyone in carrying out their work. Following the PIL filed by Dr. Sarita Parikh, on the increasing number of deaths due to snake bites in rural Maharashtra, the Bombay High Court ordered the state government to consider framing an Emergency Medical Services Act along the lines of the one in Gujarat, that will make emergency medical aid as good as a fundamental right.HC asks state to frame new law to deal with medical emergencies, Mumbai Mirror, Oct 17, 2014 References Category:2012 establishments in India Category:Organisations based in Maharashtra Category:Organizations established in 2012 ","title":"Supervasi"},{"id":"42171017","title":"Development of Grand Theft Auto V"},{"id":"42171024","text":"Myrmecia browningi is an Australian bull ant species, a part of the genus Myrmecia.

Pragya is the state of wisdom which is higher than the knowledge obtained by reasoning and inference. Meaning The Sanskrit word प्रज्ञ (Prajña) is the combination of \\"प्र (pra-)\\" which prefix means – before, forward, fulfiller, and used as the intensifier but rarely as a separate word and \\"ज्ञ (jna)\\" which means - knowing or familiar with. प्रज्ञ (Prajña), meaning - wise, prudent, knowing, conversant with, is the root of प्राज्ञ (Prājña) meaning – wise, learned man, intellectual, clever, intelligence dependent on individuality; प्रज्ञा (Prajñā) meaning – intelligence, judgement, mental attitude, particular shakti or energy, insight, mental disposition, true or transcendental wisdom, awareness, mentality, understanding, discrimination, knowledge; and प्राज्ञा (Prājñā) meaning – understanding, intelligence. In the state of deep sleep, the Atman, limited by Prana, the vital breath, is called Prājña. Vedic reference There are a few Vedic Mantras which hint at Prājña, the wise and the learned intellectual. and so does Isha Upanishad which belongs to the Shukla Yajurveda. Dayananda Saraswati, translating and commenting on the Rig Veda, draws attention to a sage of the Rig Veda who tells us – :पिशङ्गरूपः सुभरो वयोधाः श्रुष्टीवीरो आयते देवकामः  :प्रजां त्वष्टा वि ष्यतु नाभिमस्मे अथा देवानाम प्येतु पाथः २.३.९  that the radiant one, who feeds and nourishes, who ensures births, who desires association with the learned, he surely soon gains wide varied knowledge (and becomes intelligent and aware). And, to Vishwamitra who tells us - :यदद्य त्वा प्रयति यज्ञे अस्मिन् होतिश्च्कितवोऽवृणीमहीह  :ध्रुवमया ध्रुवमुताशमिष्ठाः प्रजानन् विद्वान् उप याहि सोमम् ३.२९.१६  that those who constantly strive to understand the ways and methods of the objective world and its origin and its being surely attain divinity (aishvarya). Sayana commenting on mantra III.27.7 observes that the most common meaning of māyā are prajñā ('intelligence') and kapata ('deceit') and that kratu of the compound-word Sukratu in mantra I.20.8 implies either karma (act) or prajñā ('knowledge'). Upanishadic reference The third chapter of the Aitareya Upanishad teaches – तत्प्रज्ञानेत्रम् प्रज्ञाने प्रतिष्ठितं प्रज्ञानेत्रो लोकः प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म (III.i.3) that all that exist, all phenomena cosmic and psychical, are rooted in Prajñā i.e. Consciousness, and Consciousness is Brahman, in which regard Sankara in his commentary states that Brahman gets the respective names and forms as conditioned by the divergent bodies; it is the same entity that has become diversified under all the conditions and is known in every way and is thought of multifariously by all creatures as well as logicians. And, in the Kaushitaki Upanishad III.iii.4, Indra describes 'Death' as complete absorption in Prana when Prānā and Prajñā ('consciousness' or 'self'), which together live in the body and together depart, become one. The main theme of Kaushitaki Upanishad is that without Prajñā the senses do not work, which is knowledge, for by knowledge one sees clearly; Prajñā is Brahman and all things are rooted in Brahman. Prānā is Prajñā, self-consciousness. It is Prajñā that takes possession of Speech, and by speech one obtains words; takes possession of the nose, and one obtains odours; takes possession of the eye, and one obtains all forms; takes possession of the ear, and one obtains all sounds; takes possession of the tongue, and one obtains all tastes of food; takes possession of the hands, and one obtains all actions; takes possession of the body, and one obtains pleasure and pain; takes possession of the organ, one obtains happiness, joy and offspring; takes possession of the feet, one obtains all movements and takes possession of mind, and one obtains all thoughts, without Prajñā, no thoughts succeed. The Vedantasara tells us that Brahman is to be thought of as being Nirguna, without attributes; Brahman is the sole reality, everything else is Anatman, non-existence and non-knowledge. Ignorance is two-fold; Brahman in relation of totality of ignorance as Ishvara has all the attributes of the creator and the ruler of the world but in relation to special ignorance is the individual soul, the defective intelligence, Prājña (प्राज्ञ) – अस्य प्राज्ञात्वमस्पष्टोपाधितयानतिप्रकाशकत्वात् ४४. Intelligence in its invisible form refers to Brahman – आनन्दभुक् चेतोमुखः प्राज्ञः (\\"Prājña, the enjoyer of bliss, with Consciousness for its aid\\" (Mandukya Upanishad 5)), the all-knowing reality, in its visible form it is the parviscient Jiva which is able to differentiate itself from Ishvara – सता सोम्य तदा सम्पन्नो भवति (\\"Then (in dreamless sleep), my dear, he (Jiva) becomes one with Existence (Ishvara) \\" (Chandogya Upanishad VI.viii.1)). Gaudapada, in his Karika on the Mandukya Upanishad, refers to the three states of consciousness, to the one Atman perceived threefold in the same body and the threefold satisfaction; he refers to Vaisvanara – जागरितस्थानो बहिष्प्रज्ञः whose sphere of action is the waking state, to Taijasa – स्वप्नास्थानोऽन्तःप्रज्ञः whose sphere is the dream state, and to Prājna (प्राज्ञ), whose sphere in the form of cause only is deep sleep bereft of dreams, as a mass of consciousness, as the Akasha in the heart and as the blissful one. He states that 'Dream' is the wrong apprehension of reality, 'Sleep' is the state in which one does not know what reality is; when the false experience in these two states disappears Turiya is realized (Gaudapada Karika I.vii.15). And, Yajnavalkya in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad advises that the intelligent seeker of Brahman, learning about the Self alone, should practice wisdom (prajñā) and not think of too many words, for that is exhausting to the organ of speech. Swami Gambhirananda explains that the state where the sleeper does not desire any enjoyable thing and does not see any dream is deep sleep, and Prājna is the doorway to the experience of the dream and waking states. Prājña is the Self as the universal person in deep sleep. Yajnavlkya tells Janaka that Chidaksha, the Self of the nature of Consciousness, is consciousness behind intelligent sound and the source of Shabda Brahman whose primary form is Aum which word is to be meditated upon as Prajñā ('Knowledge'), the inmost consciousness. Yogic reference The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali cover the intellectual plane from the average level of awareness to the enlarged dimension of super consciousness. According to Patanjali, Samadhi is the last aspect of the eight-fold path which leads to realisation of Yoga which unites the mortal with the immortal and Prajñā is the state of perfection, the one, total indivisible entity. The perfect yogi on attaining this Supreme state becomes a total non-entity. Patanjali states – तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः that the word which express Him is Om but mere repletion of Om is insufficient, for one should also meditate upon its meaning for gaining knowledge of the Atman and destruction of the obstacles to that knowledge on road to reaching Nirvichara Samadhi when the mind becomes pure and – ऋतम्भरा तत्र प्रज्ञा in that Samadhi, knowledge is said to be filled with truth which knowledge goes beyond inference and scriptures.

During the annual festival, one community presents its parade float each year. During the Great Festival at Kamine Shrine, the four communities compete for the most skilled puppeteers and the best hospitality to the local deity. The floats are five tons in weight, 15 meters in height, and from 3 to 8 meters in width. Each of them has a five-storied stage, and on each stage puppets play a scene of one story respectively. Each puppet is controlled by three to five puppeteers manipulating the ropes.  History  The origin of the parade goes back to 1695. According to Kamine Shrine, Tokugawa Mitsukuni, the second lord of Mito Domain, appointed Kamine Shrine as the Sou-Chinju, the local tutelary shrine. People held religious festivals and dedicated floats to the shrine. In the early 18th century, a puppet show began supposedly imitating Ningyō jōruri, the puppet theater with chanted narration that was very popular in Edo and Osaka area at that time. In 1945, most of the floats were lost in the war disasters, but Furyumono was restored in 1958. In addition, the existing float was registered as the Important Tangible Folk Cultural Property in 1959. In 1977, Furyumono was registered as the Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property.

Chinatown Heritage and Visitors Center, Chinese Historical Society of Southern California The Chinese massacre of 1871 was a racially motivated riot which occurred on October 24, 1871 in Los Angeles, when a mob of around 500 white men entered Chinatown to attack, rob, and murder Chinese residents of the city. An estimated 17 to 20 Chinese immigrants were systematically tortured and then hanged by the mob, making the event the largest mass lynching in American history.Erika Lee, Review of The Chinatown War: Chinese Los Angeles and the Massacre of 1871, by Scott Zesch, Journal of American History, vol. 100, no. 1 (June 2013), pg. 217. By 1900, there were about 3,000 Chinese in the city. Most residents of the old Chinatown came from Sanyi (San Yup) and Siyi (Sze Yup) in Guangdong. The Old Chinatown began to decline as more Chinese left. Many moved to East Adams around the 1920s and 1930s. The Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, built in 1933, was built over much of the former Old Chinatown, so a new Chinatown was established after Peter SooHoo Sr. and Herbert Lapham, an agent for the Santa Fe Railway, negotiated a land purchase for what would become the new Chinatown.Cho and the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California, Chinatown in Los Angeles, p. 7.

In many communities in the state of Anambra in South- Eastern Nigeria, celebrations, burial ceremonies and other special occasions during the dry season to evoke fertility and a bountiful harvest feature the performance of the Ijele masquerade.  Historical Origin  That Ijele originated from old Anambra State in Nigeria many centuries ago is not in doubt. According to UNESCO recent commentary The origin of Ijele according to available Oral story, emanated from Akwunechenyi dance group belonging to Igboezunu Aguleri, Umudiana Village of Ikenga Umueri and Umuatuolu Village of Umueri It was this very group that performed the first \\"izi egwu ijele\\"(introduction of the Mask) to other communities. The first Village to be introduced was , subsequently followed by Nsugbe, Nneyi Umueri, Nando, Awkuzu etc. Its pertinent to note that Igboezunu Aguleri was instrumental to introduction of the masquarade to Ivite Aguleri, Igbariamu, Nteje, and some other Villages outside Omabala areas. In recognizing the roles played by Igboezunu Aguleri Umudiana Village of Ikenga Umueri and Umuatuolu Village of Umueri in the Origin of Ijele, the Old Anambra State Government unanimously selected their Ijele Cultural troupe, to represent the State in Festival of Art & Culture known as FESTAC 1977 of which the groups won various Awards & accolades for excellence from the Federal Government in. 1977.  Description  Ijele masquerade Ijele is the largest mask system ever to enter the history of the world masking tradition. It comprises two segments: the upper and the lower segments, divided at the centre by a big python. The upper segment is called Mkpu Ijele while the lower segment is called Akpakwuru Ijele or Ogbanibe and the centre is called Eke - Ogba (Python). Ijele towers about 15 ft to 12 ft based on gravitational balance construction. It is built around the intricacy of multicolor cloths, bamboo sticks and canes in line with a creative hand element. Due to its weighty size, an outdoor big house must be prepared for Ijele anywhere it will perform. It takes about 100 men to work for six months in preparation of Ijele costumes and house before an outing performance.  Relevance of the Masquerade  Ijele is a special masquerade in Anambra and Enugu State, Nigeria. It is the King of all Masquerades and as such has 45 different other masquerades perform on top of it in the olden days. Presently, the 45 masquerades are represented by the 45 figurines seen on top of Ijele. The myth and size of Ijele is wholesome as every aspect of life is depicted on Ijele. It is the climax of all masquerades hence performs alone and mostly last. Ijele is a family of 4: the mother; father; police and palm wine taper which will be discussed under the Ijele family below.  Structure of the Masquerade  Nne Ijele meaning \\"Mother of Ijele\\". She is a usually beautiful lady masquerade that holds a big ox tail with a carved enamel plate. It performs dances to flute and soft music. Ijele Father called \\"Onuku\\": It has a big face and dresses in chieftaincy regalia. Ijele Police: they are usually six. Their duty is to ensure that the people do not encroach on Ijele father or mother. Ijele Palm Wine Tapper: It accompanies Ijele for the sole purpose of picking its rear as it performs. Another significant personality is the Ijele fan carrier of Akupe carrier. It is not really a masquerade but it plays crucial role of leading the Ijele with its symbolic powerful fan called Akupe. Once the Ijele loses sight of the fan and its carrier, it gets lost and it signifies danger. Ijele moves when the fan carrier moves and also stops when it stops.  Ijele Music  Ijele has a special brand of band group that entertains it whenever he performs. It dances majestically to the royal band group called and known as \\"Igba-eze\\" - Royal Band group or literally known as drums of the Kings popularly called \\"Akunechenyi\\" in Igbo language. The musical instruments includes 4 drums, ogene, ubom, uyo, Ekwe, flute (Oja - ufele), wooden clapper (aja - oja) amongst others.  Costumes & Symbols  Ijele Mirror: This mysterious mirror picks and sees anyone with charm or destructive weapons. The mirror magnets the person to Ijele for punishment. This mirror is reflective and creates an aesthetic beauty. Ijele Python: This is a big snake signifying royalty and mightiness of Ijele.

This affirmation comes in different ways, for example, dancing alongside the Ijele as it pays homage to a Chief or King, show ones total loyalty. If Ijele can bow, who else can not bow! Psychological: The appearance depicts a high tone of events when different facet of Igbo recreational activities is displayed. Though in some communities in Anambra State, it is restricted to young boys and girls singing and dancing to the tune of Akunechenyi music, which features very prominently during this session. Recreational: Its appearance depicts a high tone of events when different facet of Igbo recreational activities is displayed. Though in some Communities in Anambra State, it is restricted to young boys and girls singing and dancing to the Akunechenyi music which features very prominently during the festivals. Its worth to note that Ijele will never step out to perform unless Seven (7) Cannon gunshot are released to the air alongside the sound of its royal music. Therefore, its would be nice to sum it up that Ijele is a Spiritual bond between a range of Communities in Anambra State of Nigeria which is harbinger of peace, amity, dialogue and a high sense of communality.

In later life he was frequently referred to as \\"Captain Atkinson\\". History Thomas Atkinson was the fourth son of Robert Anderson, a farmer of Snitterby, Lincolnshire. His parents died when he was nine years old, and his oldest brother William for a while managed the farm but, suffering ill health and seeking a warmer climate, decided they should emigrate, so sold up and on 12 November 1839 arrived at Holdfast Bay on the barque Singapore under Captain Hamilton, with three experienced farmers as future employees. At first they settled in Kangarilla, but found the land at Willunga more fertile and moved again, founding a mixed farm while breeding sheep, dairy cattle and bullocks. At first the going was hard; their first livestock were expensive (the first 40 head of cattle which they purchased cost them from £16 to £20 each, and their horses from £65 to £95 per head), then recession hit and their progeny were virtually worthless and they were producing more butter than the market could bear, but then copper was found at Burra, and bullocks were in high demand so the brothers prospered. They dissolved their partnership and Thomas, who had received some instruction in architecture and bricklaying in England, built the Bush Inn at Willunga in 1840, and purchased Ashley Farm, where he and his wife (a daughter of Stephen Bastian) lived the rest of their lives. Thomas was a good farmer, an early adopter of improved farming techniques; he was one of the first to employ seed drills and manure drills, and paid attention to scientific breeding of his cattle. The only time he exhibited in the Adelaide Show he won first prize for his Durham bull. He was also keen on thoroughbred racing, but though he employed a jockey and trainer, his only real successes were in country meetings. He was a longtime member of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia and for many years a committee member. He was a fine judge of horses and cattle and was employed in that capacity in most of the Shows throughout South Australia until 1898, when at 76 years of age he resigned from all his commitments. He was one of South Australia's first Justices of the Peace, and was also appointed one of the first Road Commissioners (a predecessor of district councils) during Sir Henry Young's time, then was a member of the Willunga District Council for 28 years. He was a commissioner for the Sydney and Melbourne exhibitions, and for many years a member of the School Board of Advice. In 1860 he was appointed captain of the Willunga Rifle Volunteer Force, and in 1895 honorary captain of the Mounted Volunteer Force (both militias of the Colony in the years before Federation). He took Sir John Colton's place in Parliament as member for Noarlunga in September 1878, and continued as a member until 1887, when Dashwood beat him by 13 votes. Though an able raconteur, he was not fond of public speaking and was referred to in Parliament as the \\"silent member\\". Family Thomas's brothers who migrated to South Australia were: William (1814 – November 1840); Robert (1820 – 8 June 1862); Joseph (1824 – 25 September 1878). All died at Willunga. A sister Susanna (1828 – 31 May 1894) also made the trip and married James Holman (ca. 1827 – 1 May 1903) on 9 September 1852; they lived at Napperby, near Port Pirie. Atkinson married Jane Bastian (1 April 1824 – 24 July 1910) on 20 May 1847. Both died at \\"Ashley Farm\\" and were buried in St. Stephen's (Anglican) cemetery, Willunga. Their adopted son, Thomas Arthur Palmer, was born in 1868 and died on 7 March 1885. They had no other children.

Background and early life Born to Arthur Darrel Sykes and Baroness Manuela Ottilie Von Hundelshausen, she was educated at Richmond County School for Girls and University College London. She served in the Women's Royal Naval Service during the Second World War.The Times House of Commons, 1955 She worked as a lecturer, writer, and public relations adviser.The Times House of Commons, 1966 Politics Her introduction to politics came at University College London where she was secretary of the students union.The Times House of Commons, 1966 She was a student of international affairs. She was Vice-president of the World Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth. She was a member of the executive of the World Assembly of Youth.The Times House of Commons, 1955 She first stood for parliament as Liberal candidate for Finchley at the 1955 General Election. Finchley was a Conservative seat that the Liberals had not won since 1923 and had not come second since 1935. The Liberal party in 1955 was electorally at its lowest point in its history. Despite this, Sykes managed to increase the Liberal vote and save her deposit; This performance brought her to the attention of the party nationally. When a by-election occurred in Ipswich she was chosen as the Liberal candidate. Ipswich was not promising territory for the Liberals who had not run a candidate at the two previous elections. However, the party wanted a good candidate as the by-election was expected to attract media attention as the former Liberal MP Dingle Foot was standing as the Labour candidate. She polled 21.4% the highest Liberal percentage vote in Ipswich since 1929; This result encouraged her to contest Ipswich again at the following general election rather than return to fight Finchley. She managed to improve slightly on her by-election vote share; She started to rise to prominence in the Liberal party nationally and was elected a member of the Liberal Party Council.The Times House of Commons, 1964 She was then elected as a member of the Liberal Party National Executive. She took a particular interest in the situation in South Africa and was an executive member of the Anti-Apartheid Movement.The Times House of Commons, 1966 With the Liberal party experiencing something of a mini-revival she contested Ipswich for a third time at the 1964 General Election. Although she again managed to increase the Liberal vote share, she was unable to make the same sort of advance the Liberals were making elsewhere; For the 1966 General Election, Sykes switched constituencies to contest the Cornish seat of Falmouth and Camborne. Although the seat was in a part of the country where the Liberals were much stronger, she was again starting from third place. With the Liberal vote dropping slightly across the country, Sykes experienced for the first time that same shift in support; She became disillusioned with the Liberal party but not much on policy grounds. Her only real difference came in her opposition to the Liberal policy of Britain joining the Common Market. In March 1967 she announced that she had left the Liberal party to join the Labour party.OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT. \\"Manuela Sykes To Join Labour.\\" Times [London, England] 8 March 1967: 1. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 March 2014. She did not contest the 1970 General Election. Two years later she did stand again as a candidate, but this time for the Labour party in Uxbridge. Labour were hoping to regain a seat they had lost to the Conservatives in 1970 and Sykes had her best chance of being elected to parliament. However, the swing of 2% she achieved was not enough to gain the seat; She fought Uxbridge again at the following general election but again without success; She stood down as Labour candidate and did not contest the general election eight months later and did not stand for parliament again. She did however stand for election to local government and was elected to Westminster City Council in 1974. Dementia She was diagnosed with dementia and campaigned for the rights of people diagnosed with dementia. Having been placed in a care home herself, she campaigned for her right to be allowed to live in her own home. She took the case to court and in 2014 won her right to live at home.

Horner was the chief correspondent for Sveriges Radio's Asia division and had covered multiple stories surrounding the War in Afghanistan (2001–present), as well as natural disasters. Personal Nils Horner was born in Borås, Västra Götaland County, Sweden, to Ragnar Georg Vilhelm Horner and Jean Horner. He had one sister, Ingrid, who was four years older. At the age of 10, Nils' family moved into a home in Brämhult, but never really settled down in one place until he accepted his position in Hong Kong. Following his death, his body was laid to rest in his hometown of Borås. Career Prior to his work with Sveriges Radio, Horner worked for Borås Tidning and Svenska Dagbladet in the 1980s. From there, he moved to the United States and United Kingdom in the 1990s where he worked as a freelance writer before ultimately joining Sveriges in 2001. During his career, he covered stories including the decline of the Taliban, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and the Fukushima disaster. Horner served as the South Asia correspondent for Sveriges Radio at the time of his death. He acknowledged the danger he was sometimes in when he spoke in 2011 to a co-worker at Swedish Radio about his decision to stay on the front lines of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster: \\"Most journalists are not interested in risking their lives for a story. Some do, but I don't think it's in our culture here at Swedish Radio to take insane risks to do the story and also as radio journalists we don't have to be extremely close to people shooting. As a TV cameraman they have to be very close to get the pictures but we don't feel the same pressure to be always in the middle of some firefight or something but of course we want to be as close as possible and in Japan, I wanted to come close to the people who were thinking of whether they should evacuate or not, so you almost have to ask yourself everyday, is it worth taking the risk or is it not?\\" Author Scott Taylor, who describes himself as a “maverick war reporter”, described working beside Horner while they investigated the killing of civilians in Kosovo, during its civil war with the former Yugoslavia. Death Horner died on 11 March 2014 following a gunshot to the head while outside of a previously attacked restaurant in Kabul. Horner was there to follow up on a terrorist attack the restaurant had suffered two months prior. While on his way to investigate the story, two men shot Horner execution style in the middle of a street in the Wazir Akbar Khan, Kabul district. A division of the Taliban, Fidai Mahaz, claimed the murder citing the theory that Horner was a British spy; however, it is unclear whether these claims are factual or not. The two suspects were caught on video fleeing the area; however, no arrests were made in connection to the murder. Context Two months before Horner's death, the Taliban had attacked the same Lebanese restaurant Taverna du Liban, which was a popular spot for \\"westerners.\\" On 17 January 2014 a suicide bomber led the attack with an explosion near the entrance. This was followed by gunmen who entered the restaurant and began shooting the patrons. Twenty-one people were killed within the restaurant. Only eight of these were locals. The restaurant was destroyed. Horner had returned in March 2014 to interview the cook of the restaurant about the event when he was killed. Impact According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Horner is among almost three dozen journalists who have been killed on the job in Afghanistan alone. Of the 30 journalists' deaths, 87 percent of them happened while they were covering stories about the war. Reactions Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \\"I call on the authorities to investigate this crime and bring the culprits to justice. Media workers must be able to carry out their work and keep society informed. They nurture informed public debate which is essential in carrying out the reconstruction that Afghanistan is striving to achieve.\\" Director of Swedish Radio Cilla Benkö followed with similar remarks saying, \\"It is shameful that so little is done to safeguard the working conditions of journalists. Unesco’s report indicates that, especially in the Arab world and many countries in Africa, deaths are frighteningly common with a very low rate of solving cases of killed journalists. The figure is between 1% and 3%. That compares to approximately 40% in Europe, but even there a majority of the cases remain unsolved. There ought to be more than enough reasons for politicians to challenge these truly lamentable percentages and work towards finding ways of improving them. Journalists who do not have to fear, and who can work without risking being silenced, are fundamental for functioning democracies.\\" Awards *Marcus Ölander Prize Since Horner's murder in 2014, an award and sculpture have been put in place in his honour. Borås Tidning and the Tore G Wärenstam Foundation, as well as the Radio and journalism education programme at the University of Gothenburg, have since awarded one journalist each year that exemplifies Horner's spirit with a cash prize. It is called the Nils Horner Prize.

In the early 1990s, Koning was a model in the Amsterdam gay scene, performed as a stage actor, and played in an industrial avant-punk band called !JP, which released numerous albums. Koning is known for his outspoken views and generally sarcastic nature. Despite his traditional actor training by Piet Teeling at the Children Theatre Academy and at the Kimball Institute, he is considered to be a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. In his acclaimed book Visions, he writes about his personal life in both Amsterdam and New York. Describing political issues, disappointing love affairs and drug abuse, in a witty voice, With Visions Koning reached a widespread audience. Koning returned to writing with two Dutch novels, Noppen and Anoniem, which are written from a fictional character's point of view, but seem to deal with personal grief at the same time. Early life Jean Koning was born in Zaandam, Netherlands. At an early age, Koning's parents moved further north to the hamlet West-Knollendam. According to genealogy, conducted for the Dutch TROS network, for their program Allemaal Familie, he is a cousin of performer Danny de Munk. Career =Theatre= Halfway during the 1980s, Koning enrolled into the Children Theatre Academy in Purmerend. His first part was as a party-guest in a French Play, which played local theatres. After that, Koning made a move to Amsterdam where he began working with numerous theatre-companies. During the artistic explosion in the 1990s, he further developed his career as stage- actor and performed in numerous (mostly experimental) plays. In 1998 he shifted his acting-career to a lower level, focusing mainly on his music- career. In 2005 he returned to stage-acting. In 2006 he played Mikheil Saakashvili in Het Meisje En De Macht by theatre-company Toetssteen. He played this part with his back facing the audience, which enhanced his obscurity and waywardness as an actor. In 2013 he played both Borg in Het Tijdgat and Lev Sergeyevich Termen in \\"LEV\\", two of his most appreciated parts in the theatre. In 2014 and 2015 he toured with the critically acclaimed solo-play Étonne-Moi, in which he played the legendary Vaslav Nijinsky. Stated to be a convincing and fascinating play with a wide variety of facial expressions and body language. Koning elevated the play to a stage-filling spectacle.http://www.ontdekdenhelder.com/2015/04/27/veel-variatie-bij- eenakterfestival/ =Music= Koning played electric guitar and sang in garage band !JP. Halfway during the 1990s, Koning made a shift to New York City, to pursuit a solo career in music. In 2003 Koning starts a musical side project called ILUNGA PI. This band takes the avant garde songs from the !JP catalogue and plays them in a more commercial sounding way. That same year, this project-band wins the NH Glorie Public Choice Award for best band and best performance. In 2009 Koning signed with the New York City based independent label Coffee&CheeseCake; Records and commences his solo-career in 2010 with Man Enough To Be A Woman, on Eden Records. In 2011 Koning released his Coffee&CheeseCake-debut;, Wake Up in L.A. In 2012, Koning was one of the musicians performing during the election campaign for Dutch political party Groen Links. With his third album Industrial City In The Clouds, Koning focused on a more commercial sound. The album contains songs about the history of his birth town and was highly appreciated.

A large herbivorous biped that resembles large kangaroos, the species had a heavier body than the modern roo. The structure of the skull and teeth indicates it consumed tough vegetation, resembling koalas and panda bears, and is referred to as a short-faced kangaroo. Taxonomy The type specimen was collected by E. A. Le Souef and noted in a report to the state's Caves Board, then revised and published by Ludwig Glauert as Sthenurus occidentalis in 1910. This holotype is fossil material preserving the left and right dentary of an adult found at Mammoth Cave in Southwest Australia. The specific epithet occidentalis, meaning \\"of the west\\", refers to the discovery of this species in Western Australia. Description Reconstruction A mid-sized species of Simosthenurus, known as 'short-faced' kangaroos, one of several genera in a macropodid lineage that diversified in Pliocene Australia. The mass of adults is estimated to have around 118 kilograms, standing at a similar height to larger modern roos but with a heavier and more robust body. The dentition contains molars set close to the jaw, which combined with the cranial structure, strongly indicates an animal capable of consuming tough vegetation. The short jaw and facial anatomy clearly distinguishes their appearance from the surviving lineage of kangaroos, which usually graze on grasses rather than a browsing diet, and more closely resembles the habits of the modern koala Phascolarctos cinereus. A set of powerful molars located close to the hinge of jaw, similar to but further back than a koala, improved the mechanical advantage and a potential enlargement of the zygomaticomandibularis muscles would have reduced the hazard of dislocation while biting with the rear molars. Modelling of the bite force and the skulls resistance to torsional forces suggests that the species was able to consume tough material, such as leaves, bark and branches, that could be torn with the claws of the long forelimbs. The diamond-like shape of the forehead and reinforced cheek bones was able to distribute the forces applied by large muscles to the rear molars at one side of the jaw, strongly suggesting that browsing habit included an ability to tear and chew hardy and fibrous material. The morphology of the skull and dentition was found to be most comparable to Asian mammal Ailuropoda melanoleuca (panda), an animal that primarily feeds as a browser of tough plant material. Distribution and habitat  The species is represented in the records of many southern fossil sites in Australia, including Tasmania. The type locality is located in Southwest Australia, at Mammoth Cave, and evidence from another site in the southwest indicates it existed until about 42 000 years ago. Fossils assigned to the species have been obtained at sites in the Southwest, southern regions of Central Australia and the southeast of the continent. In Tasmania S. occidentalis has been identified at fossil sites in the northeast and central regions, the species has also been found at the nearby King Island. Their distribution in the Pleistocene is dated to late-middle to late deposits.

Biography Bouteldja Belkacem grew up in the El Hamri neighborhood of Oran in Algeria. He is considered a pillar of modern raï. One of those who modernized the raï with Messaoud Bellemou, in the 1960s, he began to use the accordion in place of the zamr, which allowed a rai performer to play and sing at the same time. But since the accordion could not play quarter tones, Bouteldja transformed it by changing the length of the strips of metal inside, making it compatible with the traditional Algerian melodic system. On 9 December 1965, he recorded at Brahim El Feth's, his first tape followed by a disk with two hits. In 1968, his editor left for Paris, and Belkacem Bouteldja to honor his contract had an obligation to go back and forth to record three discs. In late 1969 his encounter with Messaoud Bellemou upset the traditional raï; their 1974 record marked the effective birth of pop-raï. Their collaboration endured until the end of 1979. Bouteldja withdrew for a while returning in 1985, for the first held Rai Festival in Oran, with representatives of the new wave such as Cheb Khaled, Hamid and many others. In 1993, summarizing the history of rai, Belkacem Bouteldja would say: \\"Life is like that.

The congregation consisted of 13 charter members. Initially, the church met in the Senate Chamber of the Republic of Texas, moving nearby to its first building in 1842. Later the congregation become a prominent member of the Southern Presbyterian Church, and planted several Presbyterian congregations in Houston. The church grew rapidly. First Presbyterian begun mission efforts to South Korea and Brazil.http://www.fpchouston.org/history.php www.fpchouston.org/history.php The church moved to its current location in 1948. The new sanctuary building was the first air-conditioned sanctuary in Texas. In 2001 B. William Vanderbloemen was elected as the church's pastor. Vanderbloemen resigned in January 2007 after taking leave in December 2006. In February 2014 the church voted whether or not to sever ties with the PCUSA, following a policy change in which the latter organization opened the possibility of the ordination of openly gay ministers. First Presbyterian narrowly voted to stay with the denomination. The building behind the Carnegie Library served from 1896 until it burned down in 1932. In November 2016, despite the election results, the church session decided to leave the PCUSA and align with ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians.http://www.christianpost.com/news/texas-presbyterian-megachurch- votes-leave-pcusa-for-conservative- eco-171803/http://fpchouston.org/denomination/ The senior pastor is Jim Birchfield.http://www.fpchouston.org/senior_pastor.php www.fpchouston.org/senior_pastor.php School Presbyterian School is on the grounds of the church.

It was formed by secession from Shelby County Schools in 2014. History Collierville Schools was formed in 2014 as one of six suburban school districts to secede from Shelby County Schools after the Tennessee legislature permitted the formation of new school districts the previous year. The district saw considerable reshuffling due to overcrowding at the start of the 2018–19 school year. The high school received a new amenity-laden $94 million campus, and Schilling Farms Middle School moved into the old high school building as \\"West Collierville Middle School\\". The Schilling Farms namesake and old campus were thereafter used for a new elementary school. The following year, the district shifted its middle and high school start times to a later schedule. The shift was prompted by a petition authored by high school student Chase Via that advocated for later school start times. Upon the creation of the district, former superintendent John Aikten of Shelby County Schools was selected as superintendent. After Aitken retired in 2019, he was succeeded by Dr. Gary Lilly, former superintendent of Bristol Tennessee City Schools.

Life  Constantine was a nephew of the powerful Michael Keroularios, Patriarch of Constantinople in 1043–1059. The name of his father is unknown. A friend and correspondent of Michael Psellos, Constantine and his brother Nikephoros were among the supporters of Isaac I Komnenos when he rose in revolt to seize the throne in 1057, and went on to occupy senior offices in the Byzantine hierarchy. In his correspondence with Psellos, Constantine is variously referred to by the high court ranks of sebastos, proedros, protoproedros, and magistros, the senior fiscal offices of sakellarios and genikos logothetes, and the judicial offices of epi ton kriseon and droungarios tes viglas. It was probably under Constantine's tenure that the latter office acquired the epithet \\"megas\\" (\\"grand\\"), and was confirmed as the Empire's senior-most judicial authority. Constantine was apparently also the first person to hold the title of sebastos. A seal which may be attributable to him further records the titles of \\"vestarches, judge of the Velum, and grand curator of the Mangana\\". Constantine was also a cousin of Eudokia Makrembolitissa, who married Isaac's lieutenant and successor as emperor, Constantine X Doukas, as she too is referred to as a niece of the patriarch. In 1067, Constantine X was dying. Eudokia, as empress-dowager and mother of Constantine's under-age sons, would lead the regency, but Constantine X feared that she might well include her relatives, who already held high posts in court, in the regency, thus posing a potential threat to the succession of Constantine X's own children. He therefore had Eudokia swear publicly that she would not remarry nor appoint any co-regents over her under- age sons with Constantine other than the latter's brother John Doukas, an oath that she would soon break, however, with her marriage to Romanos IV Diogenes. Constantine Keroularios died sometime under Nikephoros III Botaneiates (ruled 1078–1081), as his will was the subject of an investigation at this time.  Family  According to genealogy of the 12th-century writer John Tzetzes, Constantine Keroularios married a Georgian lady, a relative of the empress Maria of Alania. The couple had a daughter, who was eventually adopted by Eudokia Makrembolitissa. She married a tax official named George, and gave birth to Tzetzes' own mother. Constantine had also several sons, of whom Michael Keroularios was the most prominent: he likewise became megas droungarios tes viglas and married into the Komnenos dynasty, but defrauded his other brothers of their father's inheritance.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History Nothing is known about the original builder of the castle, but in 1190 the Herren von Siebenthal may have lived in Mannenberg. In 1270 the castle Mamerberg was owned by the knight Peter von Raron. Under the von Raron family the estate was divided into the Mannenberg Castle and the Herrschaft of Mannenberg-Reichenstein. The castle is first mentioned in 1304 as castrum de Mannenberg and around that time Peter von Raron sold it to Heinrich IV von Strättlingen.Burgenweg.ch accessed 11 March 2014 The castle was sold to the Counts of Gruyères in 1336 while the estate passed to the heirs of the von Raron family following their extinction. In 1456 the Freiherr von Bubenberg acquired the Herrschaft and in 1494 sold it to the city of Bern. The castle was held by the Counts who attempted to expand their power in the Simmental (Simme valley). At some point, probably in the 14th century, they built Unterer Mannenberg Castle as an expansion of the Oberer castle. In 1339 the Counts of Gruyères supported the city of Fribourg against Bern in the Battle of Laupen. The Bernese victory and their expanding power in the Simmental created tension between the Counts and the surrounding farmers. In 1350 Bernese troops attacked and partially destroyed Oberer Mannenberg Castle.Burgen Seite.ch accessed 11 March 2014 It was apparently rebuilt, because in 1356 the Counts of Gruyères sold the castles to the Fribourg supporting Düdingen family. The Düdingens already held nearby Blankenburg Castle, so Mannenberg reinforced their power in the area. However, their hold was short lived. In 1376 the villagers of the surrounding communities rose up against the Fribourg nobility, forcing the Düdingens to sell Mannenberg and Blankenburg to the city of Fribourg. Tensions continued to rise between Bern and Fribourg leading to the Battle of Sempach in 1386. Following the Bernese victory in the Battle, Fribourg lost their holdings in the Simmental. Bern combined the Herrschaft of Mannenberg-Reichenstein with the castles and appointed a vogt to oversee the lands. The vogt settled in Blankenburg Castle and made it into the center of government. Both Mannenberg castles were allowed to fall into ruin. During the 20th century several archeological expeditions explored portions of the ruins, but they remained generally covered in brush. In 2007 the Burg Mannerberg Foundation was established to restore and maintain the ruins. The project was initially projected to cost about 770,000 CHF with the Swiss Federal government and the Canton of Bern providing the majority of the funds, while the Foundation provided about 194,000 CHF. The project was completed in 2011 at a total cost of about 880,000 CHF. Today several walls and parts of a round tower are free of the earth and stand in a clearing. The ruins of the castle are topped with a sight seeing platform.

Member firms, which are initially admitted on the basis of quality, reputation, size and volume of international work, as a basic tenet, have no formal association with each of the other member firms, i.e., each is independent, thus giving each firm access to firms all over the world to assist with its clients’ legal matters with little likelihood that there will be a conflict of interest.

The company was founded in 2013 by David Back and Greg Moran . As of April, the company operates in 45 cities across the country.  History of zoomcar  American duo David Back & Greg Moran, met while studying at the University of Pennsylvania, where both graduated in 2007. After graduating, Back studied at Harvard Law School and Moran worked on energy financing projects. The pair also attended business school; Moran at the University of Southern California and Back at the Judge Business School at Cambridge University. Back and Moran both dropped out of business school to move to India and pursue a venture in car rentals. In May 2015, Back resigned from the self-drive car rental company, and decided to move back to the US citing personal reasons. Zoom officially launched operations in Bangalore in February 2013. Zoom started with $215,000 in capital and a fleet of seven cars.  Investors and Valuation  Zoom initially raised capital from individual investors including Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Chair of the UK Institute of Directors Lady Barbara Judge, Vice-Dean of International Legal Studies at Harvard Law School William P. Alford, Wharton Statistics Chair Edward George, and the former Director of the Cambridge Centre for Entrepreneurial Studies Shai Vyakarnam. Back met Summers at Harvard University, where Back was a teaching assistant to Summers. Zoomcar's institutional investors include: Mahindra&Mahindra;, Ford Motor Company, Sequoia Capital, Nokia Growth Partners, FundersClub, Basset Investment Group, Athene Capital, Empire Angels, Venture Souk, OurCrowd, Globevestor., and Cyber Carrier CL. Zoomcar has also raised money from former Infosys CFO T.V. Mohandas Pai and his business partner Abhay Jain. At Ford's investor day presentation in September 2016, CEO Mark Fields described difficulties with Ford's prior strategy in India, but commented \\"Our new mobility business could be a factor that plays in there. That's why you saw us about a month ago take an equity position in Zoomcar, which is the largest car sharing service in India.\\" Zoomcar has raised a total funding of Rs. 673 Cr. and it has been valued at Rs. 1778 Cr. in its latest round of funding.  Competition  Zoomcar faces competition from Revv, Drivezy, MylesCars (backed by Carzonrent), Ola Drive by (Ola Cabs) and other similar car rental companies.  Partnerships  Zoom partnered with the auto manufacturers like Ford & Mahindra which allowed them to become the first car rental company in India to offer an electric vehicle (the Mahindra REVA E2O by Mahindra) and the Ford EcoSport \\"urban SUV by Ford\\" in 2013. Zoom also works with locally established real estate developers, universities, hotels, and corporate IT parks to secure parking for its vehicles and offer pick-up points to its members. In November 2013, Zoom, Uber, and the Ashoka Foundation launched a month-long campaign in Bangalore called RideSmartBLR to encourage car-rental and discourage drunk driving for its health, economical and environmental benefits. Zoom was a member of Microsoft's Accelerator Plus program in Bangalore in Spring 2014. This program is designed to provide more tailored assistance to later-stage start-ups as they scale their business and raise capital.  Opposition  In July 2015, Zoomcar issued caution information to its customers following opposition from the Ladakh taxi union. Following an incident in which a convoy of 15 cars rented from the company was reportedly attacked by members of the union with stones and iron rods, Zoomcar issued a cautionary mail to customers traveling to Khardung La and Nubra valley. The following week Zoom issued an update stating that the situation had aggravated and the company urged extreme caution to customers traveling to the region. The taxi unions of Gulmarg and Ladakh continue to resist entry of non-local commercial cars in the region.  Controversy  In December 2015, the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) banned 54 controversial Indian ads which included a video advertisement by Zoomcar. The ad was found to be in violation of India's Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 by the council, following which the advertisement was pulled off by the company.

He authored a popular book about his experiences and collected Tibetan cultural items and sold them to museums. He was shot and killed by brigands in 1922 while traveling by mule near Batang. Early life and family Shelton was born 9 June 1875 in Indianapolis, Indiana to Joseph O. Shelton, a carpenter, and Emma Rosabelles Belles. In 1880 the family moved to a farm in Bourbon County, Kansas, in 1884 to Harper County, Kansas, and in 1892 to Grant County, Kansas on the Great Plains of western Kansas. He married Flora Flavia Beal (b. 28 September 1871) on 27 April 1899.Wissing, Douglas A. Pioneer in Tibet New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, pp. 7-24, 39 Shelton attended Emporia State University in Emporia, Kansas and studied medicine at the University of Kentucky, graduating in 1903. That same year he was appointed as a missionary to China by the Foreign Christian Missionary Society (FCMS) of the Disciples of Christ denomination. He was ordained as a minister in San Francisco prior to his departure for China by ship on 29 September 1903.Wissing, pp. 33-45 The Sheltons had two children: Dorris Shelton Still, born 25 August 1904 and Dorothy Madelon, born 27 May 1907, both in Kangding, China.Wissing, p. 93 Advancing the mission frontier The Sheltons traveled to China with medical doctor Susanna Carson Rijnhart, who had attempted to visit Lhasa, Tibet in 1898. Her husband and infant child died in that attempt. On arrival in China, the Sheltons and Rijnhart traveled up the Yangtze River by boat, foot, and horseback through the rugged eastern ranges of the Himalayas reaching the frontier trading center of Kangding, then called Tachienlu, on March 15, 1904.Duncan, Marian L. A Flame of the Fire http://globalministries.org/news/eap/a-flame-of-the-fire- the.html, accessed 10 Mar 2014, p. 118-119 In 1908, the Sheltons and another missionary family, the Ogdens, established a mission at Batang, a town of 350 Tibetan families, in the Kham region of Tibet, a seventeen-day overland journey westward from Kangding. This was the first Christian mission to be established in Batang. In 1909 medical missionary Zenas Sanford Loftis joined the Sheltons and Ogdens, but he perished from smallpox two months after his arrival.Hefley, James; Hefley, Marti (1978). By Their Blood: Christian Martyrs of the 20th Century. Milford, Michigan: Mott Media. p. 144.The Missionary Intelligencer. Cincinnati: Foreign Christian Missionary Society. 1918. Shelton was an indefatigable traveler via muleback who utilized his medical knowledge to gain access to both Chinese and Tibetan officials and to ensure his welcome throughout the region. Kham was a battleground between China, attempting to gain control of the area, and the Khampa Tibetans resisting the Chinese.Wissing, pp. 95-104 Lecturer and vender of Tibetan curios In 1910, the Shelton family returned to the U.S. on furlough. It took 89 days for them to travel from Batang to San Francisco. Shelton brought home with him a collection of Tibetan art and curios which he sold to the Newark, New Jersey museum for $2,000. He spoke extensively across the United States in a fund- raising campaign for the expansion of the overseas FCMS's missions and achieved the status of a \\"missionary-hero.\\" His wife, Flora, published her first book, Sunshine and Shadow on the Tibetan Border.Wissing, 117-128 The Shelton's return to China was delayed until 1913 by war and chaos in Kham. They returned to Batang along with two other FCMS missionary families, the Ogdens and the Hardys, in July 1914. The missionaries financed the construction of a large comfortable compound in the small Tibetan town in which they lived and worked. Shelton continued to take photographs and collect Tibetan art to sell to museums. He also treated a great variety of patients, including Chinese soldiers wounded in fighting with Tibetans. He traveled widely over a large area. The Shelton family became \\"Tibetanized\\" in many ways. Shelton was abducted by brigands in early 1920 and held prisoner for about two months before being rescued.Wissing, pp. 127-159, 186-198 Back to the United States Shelton and his family returned to the US in 1920. He was now a famous man, touted by the FCMS as a hero for his travels and his exploits in a war torn land. National Geographic magazine published an article by him, \\"Life among the People of Eastern Tibet,\\" in 1921 and his book Pioneering in Tibet was published in the same year. He had continued collecting Tibetan art and artifacts and sold them and his photographs to the Newark Museum for more than $4,000—about triple the average yearly salary of a minister in the United States. The museum held a special exhibition of his Tibetan items. He had dinner with John D. Rockefeller and sold his wife some Tibetan jewelry. Death Shelton returned in Batang in late 1921. His wife accompanied him to China, but did not continue on to Batang. Their two children remained in the U.S. for school. Shelton's objective was to establish missions deeper into Tibet, ultimately to travel to Lhasa, but initially to Markam Gartok (called \\"Gatuo Town\\" today). On February 16, 1922, en route to Markam, he was ambushed by brigands a few miles outside Batang. He died of a gunshot wound the next day and was buried in Batang.Wissing, pp. 217-229https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35118740 After Shelton's death, the FCMS mission in Batang began to disintegrate because of internal dissension and was closed in 1932. Legacy Shelton's book Tibetan Folk Tales was published posthumously in 1925. Flora Shelton published several additional books about Tibet. Shelton, in the words of his biographer, was \\"a man who craved both adventure and social esteem; a doctor who practiced medicine intermittently; a missionary who seldom preached; a devout family man who endangered himself and his family in a perilous post.\\"Wissing, p.214 References Category:1875 births Category:1922 deaths Category:American expatriates in China Category:Christian missionaries in Tibet Category:Christian medical missionaries Category:Explorers of Tibet Category:American expatriates in Tibet Category:Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) missionaries ","title":"Albert Shelton"},{"id":"42172818","text":"Henricus exploratus is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

The exterior of the house is clad in vertical cypress boards, with a porch that wraps completely around the house, and a breezeway connecting to a carport, built at the same time. The porch roof is supported by six Douglas fir beams. The interior of the house is based on Stone's modern reinterpretation of the traditional Arkansas dog trot form, with the central living/dining/kitchen area acting as the central element of that form.

The house is largely unchanged since its construction; one chimney has been replaced due to storm damage. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

The original oath is in Pāḷi, a Middle Indo-Aryan language current in north-east India during the first half of the first millennium BCE, and now the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism. The oath consists of a preamble followed by seven articles, each of them derived from four passages from the Pāḷi Canon.Dhammika, S. Vejjavatapada: The Buddhist Physician's Vow, Singapore, 2013, p.4  Original  The original Pāḷi reads: > Vuttāni hetāni Bhagavatā: \\"Ārogyaparamā lābhā\\" ti ceva: \\"Yo maṁ upaṭṭhaheyya > so gilānaṁ upaṭṭhaheyyā\\" ti ca.

(G) Even if I cannot heal a > patient with the proper diet, proper medicine and proper nursing I will > still minister to him, out of compassion.  Origin  The Vejjavatapada is derived from four passages from the Pāḷi Canon dating from between circa 5th and the 3rd centuries BCE, each of them attributed to the Buddha. The preamble contains two quotes from the Pali Canon, the first line of verse 204 of the Dhammapada,Dhammapada ed. Hinuber. O. Von and Norman, K. R. Oxford, 1994 and from the Vinaya, where the Buddha, after having attended to a sick monk neglected by his fellows, instructed his monks to care for each other when they are sick.Vinaya Piṭaka, Oldenberg, H. ed. 1879-83. London, Vol.I,p.302 The Pāḷi Canon contains a considerable amount of information about sickness, health, medicine, healing, medical care and medical ethics.See Asceticism and Healing in Ancient India: Medicine in the Buddhist Monastery, Kenneth, G, Zysk, Delhi, 1998. Because early Buddhism did not claim that all physical conditions, injury and illness included, are necessarily caused by past karma, it saw the physicians role to be a vital one. The Buddha mentioned a range of causes of sickness of which only one is karma; the others being an imbalance in one or another of the four humors; i.e. bile (pitta), phlegm (sema), wind (vāta); an imbalance of all three (sannipāta), seasonal changes (utu), stronger than normal stress (visamaparihāra), and external agencies (opakkamika), e.g. accidents.Saṃyutta Nikāya, ed. L. Feer, PTS London 1884-98, Vol.IV,p.230 On other occasions the Buddha mentioned that inappropriate diet and overeating can likewise cause sickness while intelligent eating habits can contribute to \\"freedom from sickness and affliction, health, strength and comfortable living.\\"Anguttara Nikāya, ed. Morris, R. and Hardy, E. editor (1885-1900). PTS London, Vol. III,p. 144; and Majjhima Nikāya, ed. V. Trenchner, R. Chalmers, PTS London 1887-1902, Vol. I, p.473 The Buddha praised the competent physician and nurse in these words: \\"Those who tend the sick are of great benefit (to others).\\" Api ca gilānupaṭṭhākā bahūpakārā, Vinaya I, 303. This was in contrast to Brahmanism which looked upon doctors with disdain. See Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism, Johannes Bronkhorst, 2011, pp.115-6. Because the Pāḷi Canon predates the separation and specialization of the medical profession as presented in āyurvedic treatises, it rarely makes a distinction between the doctor or physician (bhisakka, tikicchaka, vejja) and the nurse (gilānaupaṭṭhāka).Zysk, p.43 At that time the doctor probably performed all the functions in the sick room, including that of nursing patients.  Explanation  Of the following articles, the first five are based closely on a discourse in which the Buddha lays down the attitudes and skills which would make \\"one who would wait on the sick qualified to nurse the sick.\\".Anguttara Nikaya III, p.144 The final article is taken from the discourse in which the Buddha describes three types of patients according to their response to treatment: *One who dies whether he gets proper treatment or not *One who recovers whether he gets proper treatment or not *One who recovers only if he gets proper treatment. In the case of this first type, he or she should still be treated and nursed out of compassion and just in case there is a chance, no matter how slim, of recovery.Anguttara Nikaya I, p.121 Of the seven articles in the Vejjavatapada, the first highlights the importance of care (hita), kindness (dayā) and compassion (anukampā) in the healing process. The second concerns the physician's responsibility to be fully trained in and skilled in the administration of drugs, given that the physician's raison d'être is effective healing and that some medicines and surgical procedures can be potentially dangerous. According to Dhammika, this second article is equivalent to the Hippocratic Oath's third and fourth stipulation that the physician shall never do anything to harm a patient, even if asked to do so.Dhammika, p.5 It is the primum non nocere of Western medical ethics. The fourth article counsels the physician to put their welfare above his or her personal gain. The fifth article recognizes that at times it might be necessary to deal with the loathsome aspects of the human body and that the physician should do this with detachment, both for his or her own mental balance and so as not to embarrass the patient. The sixth article recognizes the fact that spiritual counseling or comfort can have a part to play in healing and that the physician needs to have at least some abilities in this area. There are several discourses which describe the Buddha doing just this.Anguttara Nikāya III,297; Saṃyutta Nikāya V,381. Later Buddhist literature often encourages caring for and visiting the sick. The Brahmajala Sūtra says: \\"If a disciple of the Buddha sees anyone who is sick, he should provide for that person's needs as if he were making an offering to the Buddha.\\" See Brahma Net Sutra, STCUSC, New York, 1998, VI,9. The Saddhammopāyana (Sri Lanka 12th century) says: \\"Nursing the sick was much praised by the Great Compassionate One and is it a wonder that he would do so? For the Sage sees the welfare of others as his own and thus that he should act as a benefactor is no surprise. This is why attending to the sick has been praised by the Buddha. One practicing great virtue should have loving concern for others.\\" See Sadddhammopāyana, edited by Richard Morris, Journal of the Pali Text Society, 1887, pp.35-72. The seventh and final article requires the physician to minister to the patient even if all the signs indicate that he or she is not responding to the treatment and will probably die. Even a dying patient may need palliative care and made to be physically and mentally comfortable. In an interesting comparison to this, Suśruta, the father of Indian medicine, advises the physician not to treat a patient he suspects of being incurable so as not to be blamed for the patient's death and injure his reputation.An English Translation of the Sushruta Samhita Based on Original Sanskrit Text, Bhishagratna, K.

It uses artificial neural network machine learning methods in its algorithm. It is a server-side program, featuring a website serving as a front-end interface, which can predict a protein's secondary structure (beta sheets, alpha helixes and coils) from the primary sequence. PSIPRED is available as a web service and as software. The software is distributed as source code, licensed technically as proprietary software. It allows modifying, but enforces freeware provisions by forbidding for-profit distribution of the software and its results.  Secondary structure  Secondary structure is the general three-dimensional form of local segments of biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA). It does not, however, describe specific atomic positions in three-dimensional space, which are considered to be the tertiary structure. Secondary structure can be formally defined by the hydrogen bonds of the biopolymer, as observed in an atomic-resolution structure. In proteins, the secondary structure is defined by the patterns of hydrogen bond between backbone amino and carboxyl groups. Conversely, for nucleic acids, the secondary structure consists of the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases. The hydrogen bonding patterns may be significantly distorted, which makes automatic determination of secondary structure difficult. Efforts to use computers to predict protein secondary structures, based only on their given primary structure sequences, have been ongoing since the 1970s. Secondary structure prediction involves a set of methods in bioinformatics that aim to predict the local secondary structures of proteins and RNA sequences based only on knowledge of their primary structure – amino acid or nucleotide sequence, respectively. For proteins, a prediction consists of assigning regions of the amino acid sequence as highly probable alpha helixes, beta strands (often noted as extended conformations), or turns. The success of a prediction is determined by comparing it to the results of the DSSP algorithm applied to the crystal structure of the protein; for nucleic acids, it may be determined from the hydrogen bonding pattern. Specialized algorithms have been developed to detect specific well-defined patterns such as transmembrane helixes and coiled coils in proteins, or canonical micro-RNA structures in RNA.  Basic information  The idea of this method is to use the information of the evolutionarily related proteins to predict the secondary structure of a new amino acid sequence. PSIBLAST is used to find related sequences and to build a position- specific scoring matrix. This matrix is processed by an artificial neural network, which was constructed and trained to predict the secondary structure of the input sequence; in short, it is a machine learning method.  Prediction algorithm (method)  The prediction method or algorithm is split into three stages: generating a sequence profile, predicting initial secondary structure, and filtering the predicted structure. PSIPRED works to normalize the sequence profile generated by PSIBLAST. Then, by using neural networking, initial secondary structure is predicted. For each amino acid in the sequence, the neural network is fed with a window of 15 acids. Added information is attached, indicating if the window spans the N or C terminus of the chain. This results in a final input layer of 315 input units, divided into 15 groups of 21 units. The network has one hidden layer of 75 units and 3 output nodes (one for each secondary structure element: helix, sheet, coil). A second neural network is used to filter the predicted structure of the first network. This network is also fed with a window of 15 positions. The indicator on the possible position of the window at a chain terminus is also forwarded. This results in 60 input units, divided into 15 groups of four. The network has one hidden layer of 60 units and results in three output nodes (one for each secondary structure element: helix, sheet, coil). The three final output nodes deliver a score for each secondary structure element for the central position of the window. Using the secondary structure with the highest score, PSIPRED generates the protein prediction. The Q3 value is the fraction of residues predicted correctly in the secondary structure states, namely helix, strand, and coil.

Biography In 1963, he released his first single, at 18, Chetek el Berah. In 1963, he gave his first concert \\"Scène d'été\\" in Chaabet El Ham and Aïn Témouchent. His first success came in 1968 with the single El Caoucaou. Then he was a violinist for the orchestra of Oran radio from 1967 to 1969. In 1969, Raba Raba and El Fermliya are released and are still appreciated to this day by the public. Like a lot of raï artists of his generation, he began his raï singer career at the end of 60s with Melhoun Bedoui music (also called old raï) With Boussouar El Maghnaoui, Bouteldja Belkacem and the musician Gana El Maghnaoui, he was one of the fathers of modern raï (also called pop Bedoui or pop raï). Boutaiba Sghir has also worked with Messaoud Bellemou a notorious Algerian trumpeter. Boutaiba Sghir will inspire many singers like Cheb Khaled. Cheb Khaled would said about him: \\"I am not the king of rai, I'm the ambassador. The real king is Boutaiba Sghir, it was he who taught me everything\\". In an interview for an Algerian video about the Raï History only in Algeria (see external links), Boutaiba Sghir declared to an Algerian journalist \\" The raï music was prohibited in all algerian medias (radios and TV) during the 70's\\". It's why there is not video of Algerian raï singers in Algerian TV or radios archives in 70s. He has also declared in different videos on YouTube that Cheb Hasni is not a Raï Singer but an Asri Singer and that the pop raï (also called modern Bedoui or modern raï) existed before the coming of the trumpeter Bellemou. In September 2010, Boutaiba Sghir was invited in Paris by Cheb Khaled with Maurice El Medioni, Cheb Sahraoui and Chaba Zahouania for a concert in tribute to Oran, entitled Oran Café.

The band is noted for its founder Navene Koperweis, a multi- instrumentalist who engineers, produces, and plays all the instruments for the band's recordings. History Fleshwrought formed when Navene Koperweis teamed up with Nic Gauthier and made a demo at a friend's home. A live lineup followed, consisting of Koperweis, Gauthier, and Chase Fraser, with whom Koperweis had previously played in Animosity. The band played several shows in Santa Cruz, California, but later slowed down due to Animosity's high frequency tour schedule. Koperweis moved to San Francisco and continued writing material with his newly equipped gear, which included seven-string guitars, computers, and recording software. Koperweis met Jonny Davy (of Job for a Cowboy) while on a tour with Animosity, and invited him to join the band. They started working on material that would become Dementia/Dyslexia. Because Koperweis was living in San Francisco while Davy was living in Phoenix, Arizona, they sent demos to each other via internet, before grouping out again in Koperweis' studio to finish the recording. Dementia/Dyslexia was released in 2010 and received mostly positive reviews. Influences The band is influenced by a wide range of musical genres, including electronic, progressive, and experimental music.

Cloud load balancing is the process of distributing workloads across multiple computing resources. Cloud load balancing reduces costs associated with document management systems and maximizes availability of resources. It is a type of load balancing and not to be confused with Domain Name System (DNS) load balancing. While DNS load balancing uses software or hardware to perform the function, cloud load balancing uses services offered by various computer network companies. Comparison With DNS load balancing Cloud load balancing has an advantage over DNS load balancing as it can transfer loads to servers globally as opposed to distributing it across local servers. In the event of a local server outage, cloud load balancing delivers users to the closest regional server without interruption for the user. Cloud load balancing addresses issues relating to TTL reliance present during DNS load balancing. DNS directives can only be enforced once in every TTL cycle and can take several hours if switching between servers during a lag or server failure. Incoming server traffic will continue to route to the original server until the TTL expires and can create an uneven performance as different internet service providers may reach the new server before other internet service providers. Another advantage is that cloud load balancing improves response time by routing remote sessions to the best performing data centers.  Importance of Load Balancing  Cloud computing brings advantages in \\"cost, flexibility and availability of service users.\\"Randles, Martin, David Lamb, and A. Taleb-Bendiab. \\"A comparative study into distributed load balancing algorithms for cloud computing.\\" Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA), 2010 IEEE 24th International Conference on. IEEE, 2010. Those advantages drive the demand for Cloud services. The demand raises technical issues in Service Oriented Architectures and Internet of Services (IoS)-style applications, such as high availability and scalability. As a major concern in these issues, load balancing allows cloud computing to \\"scale up to increasing demands\\" by efficiently allocating dynamic local workload evenly across all nodes.Ferris, James Michael. \\"Methods and systems for load balancing in cloud-based networks.\\" U.S. Patent Application 12/127,926.  Load Balancing Techniques  = Scheduling Algorithms = Opportunistic Load Balancing (OLB) is the algorithm that assigns workloads to nodes in free order. It is simple but does not consider the expected execution time of each node. Load balance Min-Min (LBMM) assigns sub-tasks to the node which requires minimum execution time. =Load Balancing Policies= Workload and Client Aware Policy (WCAP) is \\"implemented in a dis-centralized manner with low overhead.\\"Kansal, Nidhi Jain, and Inderveer Chana. \\"Cloud load balancing techniques: A step towards green computing.\\" IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues 9.1 (2012): 1694-0814. It specifies the unique and special property (USP) of requests and computing nodes. With the information of USP, the schedule can decide the most suitable node to complete a request. WCAP makes the most of computing nodes by reducing their idle time. Also, it reduces performance time through searches based on content information. =A Comparative Study of Algorithms = Biased Random Sampling bases its job allocation on the network represented by a directed graph. For each execution node in this graph, in-degree means available resources and out-degree means allocated jobs. In-degree will decrease during job execution while out-degree will increase after job allocation. Active Clustering is a self-aggregation algorithm to rewire the network. The experiment result is that\\"Active Clustering and Random Sampling Walk predictably perform better as the number of processing nodes is increased\\" while the Honeyhive algorithm does not show the increasing pattern. Client-side Load Balancer Using Cloud Computing Load balancer forwards packets to web servers according to different workloads on servers.

He was a member of artistic group Skupina 42 and literary group Ohnice.  Biography  Josef studied Czech and French languages at Charles University in Prague between 1938 and 1939. After the closure of colleges during World War II he undertook several jobs. He worked as a script editor in Divadlo satiry. He also worked as a journalist; his jokes, images and poetry were published in the newspaper Rovnost. After the war he worked in radio, movies and the theater. For example, he created a so-called ″rozhlásky″ for the Czechoslovak Radio; this was news for younger listeners. After 1947 he devoted himself fully to literature. He was also musically talented; he played in concerts on piano, guitar and violin. His style was based above all in jazz and he even mentions it in his poems. His resting place is Vyšehrad cemetery. In 2007 a high school was named in his memory in the town of Hlučín, where he studied.  Work  Initially his work was influenced mainly by existentialism. Irony, even bordering on mockery, is typical to his work. His work being highly lyrical was able to connect with music; it was colloquial, sometimes even vulgar in its opposing conservatism. He aimed at keeping his verse truthful, to depict the harshness of the world and he also went even for scepticism. His poems contain short stories, which impel the reader to reflection. Beside his literary work he wrote movie scenarios and did photography. = Poetry = * Příběhy a menší básně (1940) – His first work, of typical little stories; reflection of war and epoch * Osudy * Nové mýty (1946) – This collection is strongly based on the program of the artistic group Skupina 42. It contains, among others, his most famous poem Stříhali dohola malého chlapečka, which was set to music by Vladimír Mišík. He calls into question the myth of a rightful new world, being fully ironic and sarcastic; contains existentialism, absurdity and estrangement. * Veliká láska (1950) – inspired by Vladimir Mayakovsky * Český sen (1953) – moves from being committed; writing about history – when the Czechs had to fight for their future * Člověka hořce mám rád (1959) – after his disillusion of communism, returns to other topics; invincible love, even though man errs and sins * Lazar a píseň (1960) – relaxation of the regime of that time causes the language also to be loose * Moje blues (1966) – isolation of a human, scepticism, near Nové mýty; tragicomic, burning irony  Poetry for children  * Říkadla (1948) * Nevídáno neslýcháno (1964) * Zlatovláska – Kainar transformed the classical fairy tale from the collection of Karel Jaromír Erben into versified drama (1952/1953). He returned to Zlatovláska to re-versify it, this time publishing it in print (1958). = Songs = In the early 40s he wrote lyrics mainly to American swing classics (George Gershwin, R. Rodgers, D. Ellington, H. Carmichael et al.). During the occupation the Nazis condemned it as \\"Jewish- Bolshevik filth\\", which was nevertheless played among the youth, particularly on tramping meetings. Kainar put some of his texts to music himself—e.g. the songs Černá kára, Starý mrtvý vrabec, Blues železničního mostu. He also wrote the lyrics to the jazz rock masterpiece Kure v Hodincach, published by the rock band Flamengo in 1971. He translated poetry, especially from French and German.

He is most known for his documentary Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead in which he tells the story of his 60-day juice fast. He is the founder and CEO of Reboot with Joe, a health and lifestyle brand at the same time Joe was also an engineer working with different companies on a rig. Following the release of his documentary, Cross has published six books about juicing. In February 2014, Cross released his book titled The Reboot with Joe Juice Diet: Lose Weight, Get Healthy and Feel Amazing that became a New York Times best-seller.  Juice fast  In 2005, Cross weighed 22 stone (310 pounds = 140 kilograms) and suffered from an autoimmune condition, chronic urticaria, for which he had been taking medications such as the steroid prednisone for years. He spent his 30s trying traditional and non-traditional medicine to solve his illness. and unsuccessfully tried various diets in fits and starts. His daily diet mainly consisted of processed foods. Cross was a smoker and consumed alcohol regularly. According to Cross, he believed that his eating habits had caused his illness and he wanted to change his lifestyle. He wanted to get off medication as he believed that the medication or doctors were not able to offer a cure for his condition. In 2005 when he was 39, the doctors told him that with his health, he would die early and he decided to consume only juice for 60 days. Under the supervision of his doctor and a team that monitored his blood work regularly, he started the juice fast in May 2005. For his juice fast, he decided to travel across America while talking to people about their attitudes toward food. He travelled in a truck with a cameraman, a sound guy, a juicer and a generator. Cross survived on nothing but juices for 60 days during his juice fast. He used an 80/20 rule, according to which he used 80 percent vegetables and 20 percent fruit in the juice that he made to avoid getting too much sugar into his system. Cross used a special juice that he prepared called the Mean Green Juice - a mixture of kale, apples, lemon, cucumber, celery and ginger. However, he kept changing the fruits and vegetables used in the juice to ensure he consumed different plants and vegetables. According to Cross, he felt groggy and unstable the first three to five days. However after consuming only juice for five days, he started feeling well both physically and mentally. After 49 days, he lost 67 pounds (30 kg), his total cholesterol dropped from 204 to 135 and his LDL cholesterol went from 132 to 86. By day 61, Cross had lost 82 pounds and decreased his medicine dosage after reporting a complete loss of his urticaria symptoms. Following the 60-day juice fast, he consumed only foods derived from plants and no animal-based or processed food for 90 days. As of March 2013, Cross weighed 240 pounds (109 kg), a weight that he maintained for the previous five years. He hit an all-time low of 210 pounds (95 kg) near the end of his first five months on the diet. Cross’s future plan includes a juicing launch in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, Brazil and Chile. Cross does not recommend the diet as a long term solution and only recommends it as a reboot for the body. According to him, he took up the diet because he wanted a circuit breaker to stop what he was doing and not to adopt it as a permanent lifestyle. One of the misconceptions that Cross tries to correct is that people think he consumes nothing but juice. \\"That’s not a proper, healthy way to live,\\" adds Cross. Documentary films Cross filmed his juice and travel through America, and released Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead in 2011. In the movie, while travelling, Cross meets people and talks to them about their eating habits. The movie features interview segments with people who were inspired to follow his example. He charts his progress with an itemized list of what day of the fast it is, what city and what state Cross is filming in, how much weight he’s lost (both in pounds and kilograms) and what kind of medication he’s taking. During his road-trip Cross meets and inspires Phil Staples, a morbidly obese truck driver from Sheldon, Iowa, in a truck stop in Arizona to try juice fasting. The movie was originally called Death By Fat. Then it became Faster. However, after Cross came to America to shoot the movie, he had to completely change the concept and the idea of the movie. The film has been credited with doubling the sales of Breville juicers since the documentary launched on Netflix in the US in July 2011. After completing work on Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead, he continued to travel around the world to promote juicing and also plans to make a second movie about life after juicing. Cross is also involved in negotiations with media companies in the US about a TV series. A sequel to the film, Fat Sick and Nearly Dead 2 was released in 2014. The sequel follows the lives of people from the first movie, includes expert interviews and shows Cross's effort to maintain his weight. Cross produced another health documentary in 2016: The Kids Menu focuses on stopping childhood obesity.  Reboot with Joe  After Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead was released in 2010, Cross founded Reboot with Joe, a health and lifestyle brand that provides information and support to people looking to make diet and lifestyle changes. The brand is focused on consuming more fruits and vegetables for improving health. Cross currently serves as the CEO of the organization. The website of the organization offers guides for starting a juice fast and which fruits and vegetables to select. The organization has a medical advisory board to collect data and conduct research about benefits of juicing.  Books  Cross released his first book titled Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead in 2011 followed by a second book titled Reboot with Joe Recipe Book (Plant-Based Recipes to Supercharge Your Life) in 2012. He released a third book titled 101 Juice Recipes in 2013. In February 2014, he released his book titled The Reboot with Joe Juice Diet: Lose Weight, Get Healthy and Feel Amazing. In this book, he shared the plan that he used for his juice fast and subsequent diet as well as stories of some other people who have lost weight with a juice fast.

Hearing Link history  Hearing Link was formed in 2008 through the merger of two national organisations: Hearing Concern and the LINK Centre for Deafened People. Hearing Concern was originally called BAHOH – The British Association of the Hard of Hearing. It was renamed in the 1990s. It grew out of a number of informal gatherings that sprang up after the First World War when soldiers returned home deafened by gunfire. Over the years it did a huge amount of work, all focused on promoting the need for more and better support to be available for hard of hearing adults. This includes encouraging hard of hearing groups to be established and pushing for subtitles on TV and deaf awareness at government level. The LINK Centre for Deafened People, meanwhile, was set up in 1972 and focused on developing and delivering unique and specialised rehabilitation programmes for profoundly deafened adults and their families. The approach was holistic and involved the wider health and circumstances of the individual, including their family. For a short period after the merger the organisation was called Hearing Concern LINK. In January 2011, the organisation re-launched as Hearing Link. In August 2017, Hearing Link merged with Hearing Dogs for Deaf People, another leading hearing loss charity.

Trbojević, Cersko- majevička grupa korpusa pukovnika Dragoslava Račića, published 2001. Keserović was probably the most active commander of Mihailović's Chetniks in Serbia.: \\"Probably the most active Mihailovic commander in Serbia was Keserovic, who, with relatively small forces, ... \\"Operation Kopaonik\\" with several Bulgarian battalions and large forces from the SS- \\" 45 ✓ Division \\"Prinz Eugen\\" to wipe out this ...\\" Biography = 1941 = Immediately after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, then-Major Keserović joined the Pećanac Chetniks under the command of Kosta Pećanac, a World War I voivode. In August, Pećanac concluded a collaborationist agreement with the Germans. Keserović then transferred to the Chetniks of Draža Mihailović. Representatives of the Chetniks held meetings with representatives of the communist Partisan forces in the village of Bovan and made a plan to attack Kruševac. According to this plan, it was agreed that the date of the attack would be 23 September 1941, that Kruševac would be blocked before the attack, that Keserović and his Chetniks would attack the town from the west and south across Bagdala, and that communists would attack from the north and east. According to post-war Yugoslav sources, the Partisan Rasina detachment and the Chetniks' commander Keserović agreed to attack Kruševac together, on 23 September 1941. On 24 September, Keserović's Chetnik detachment attacked German troops in the Kruševac district, killing 23 soldiers. The fighting between attacking rebels and the Axis garrison had lasted for four days when Kosta Pećanac personally, with a large force of his Black Chetniks, came to release the Axis garrison.: \\"The fighting went on for four days, but Krusevac was too well-defended, and Pecanac himself with a large force of cetniks came to its relief.\\" The post- war Yugoslav sources blamed Keserović for the failure of the attack on Kruševac.:\\"Напад није успео углавном због издаје Кесеровића и његових четника. \\" These sources accuse Kesrović of attacking German garrison earlier than agreed and of halting the attack when Partisan communist forces joined the attack. At the end of September, Keserović and Radojević published a printed flyer against Kosta Pećanac and signed it People's Liberation Movement of Chetniks and Partisans (). Pećanac sentenced Keserović and Radojević to death. = 1942= According to some sources, Keserović protected a group of Jewish refugees hosted at the beginning of 1942 in the village of Dankoviće on Kopaonik. On 1 February 1942 non-legalized Chetniks commanded by Keserović captured Aleksandrovac and disarmed some members of local Chetnik garrison which was legalized with Serbian puppet government. The remaining members of local garrison joined Keserović whose forces were chased by multiple detachments of legalized Chetniks until the end of February. Initially, the headquarters of Keserović's forces was in the village of Kupci, between Kruševac and Brus, and later in the village of Kriva Reka, Brus, on Kopaonik. In August 1942, Mihailović issued his first orders that took a \\"definite position against the occupying powers\\". These orders were British-inspired and included orders to prepare to sabotage the railways in occupied Serbia. After these orders, Keserović issued a general direction urging peasants in his area of operations to hide grain, livestock, and fodder from the occupying forces. In August 1942, the joint Axis forces of German and Bulgarian troops attacked Major Keserović's Chetniks on Kopaonik and captured nine members of his headquarters; three of them were members of the British mission and were executed when they were leaving the village of Kriva Reka. In 1942, he maintained communication with Nikolaj Velimirović.:\\"Немци су, рецимо, евидентирали да је свештеник Миливоје Мандић из Александровца био веза између Влади- ке Николаја и четничких команданата Драгутина Кесеровића и Богдана Гордића.\\" Shortly before Italian capitulation in September 1943, Keserović raided two German railway transports and pushed back German attacks to Mihailović's headquarters. From 11–14 October 1942, the Military Commander in Serbia launched a large-scale Axis offensive against Mihailović's Chetniks under command of Keserović in the region around Kriva Reka on Kopaonik mountain.: \\"In October 1942, the division took part in its first large-scale military operation, against Serbian forces under one of Mihailovic's commanders, Major Dragutin Keserovic, in the Kopaonik Mountains in the region of Kriva Reka. The operation was a punitive expedition aimed against Mihailović's Chetniks, the chief target of German commanders who wanted to secure control of Serbia before important battles in North Africa.:\\"For this reason, Mihailovich's detachments became the chief target of the occupying forces. The bloody punitive expedition of October, 1942 in the vicinity of Kriva Reka, where Keserovich's headquarters were located, was an expression of the German commands intention to strengthen its control over Serbia on the eve of the decisive confrontation in North Africa, ....\\" Operation Kopaonik was part of a larger plan of the Axis forces to disarm Chetnik units.: \\"Ова акција SS дивизије \\"Принц Еуген\\" је била повезана са разоружањем четничких одреда. Војни заповедник Србије предао јој је и списак од 24 четничка официра .....Међу њима се налазио и Кесеровић.\\" The Military Commander in Serbia prepared a list of 24 Chetnik officers to be arrested by the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, one of them being Keserović.: \\"Војни заповедник Србије предао јој је и списак од 24 четничка официра .....Међу њима се налазио и Кесеровић.\\" Keserović was probably the most active commander of Mihailović's Chetniks in Serbia.: \\"Probably the most active Mihailovic commander in Serbia was Keserovic, who, with relatively small forces, ... \\"Operation Kopaonik\\" with several Bulgarian battalions and large forces from the SS- \\" 45 ✓ Division \\"Prinz Eugen\\" to wipe out this ...\\" This operation was the first large-scale engagement of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen under command of Artur Phleps, who personally commanded the Axis forces during Operation Kopaonik. The SS division had three regiments: two infantry and one artillery regiment. The German forces were also supported by several Bulgarian battalions of 1,000 men, and 300 men from the Russian Protective Corps. Keserović was informed about the attack and successfully retreated units of his detachment.: \\"Keserović je, izgleda, bio obavešten o ovom napadu pa se sa svojim odredima povukao\\" = 1943 = Two Corps of Chetniks from Serbia, one led by Keserović, during forced march over Pešter at the beginning of May 1943, rushing to protect Chetnik HQ attacked by communists on Jadovnik In January 1943, Axis forces launched Case White, a combined strategic offensive aimed at destroying the Yugoslav Partisan resistance in the neighboring Independent State of Croatia. Two corps of Chetniks were sent from occupied Serbia to support Chetnik formations that had participated on the Axis side in the offensive and had been defeated by the Partisans following the latter's crossing of the Neretva River. These corps were led by Keserović and Predrag Raković and totaled 2,000 men. By early May 1943, Mihailović became aware of the German intention to capture him and decided to return to German-occupied Serbia. Based on his orders, the two corps of Chetniks led by Keserović and Predrag Raković came from German-occupied Serbia to the area of Bijelo Polje in the Italian governorate of Montenegro to escort him back to Serbia.:\\"У оваквој ситуацији, Михајловић је решио да се врати у Србију; позвао је Раковића и Кесеровића да га у Санџаку прихвате.\\" In 1943, the British sub- mission was established in Keserović's headquarters.:\\"...to the British sub- mission established in 1943 with Major Dragutin Keserović, Mihailovićs commander in the Kopaonik area...\\" According to Chetnik officer Milan Deroc, the name of the British Liaison Officer (BLO) at Keserović's headquarters was Major Bob Wade.:\\"Major R.P. (Bob) Wade became Keserovic's British Liaison Officer (BLO).\\" By mid-1943, the differences between the British and the Chetniks had become \\"too serious and too pervasive\\". Almost without exception, the British reports were unfavorable to the Chetniks as a fighting force. The Chetniks too were unhappy with the British. Keserović issued directives to a brigade under his control to keep information from a British liaison officer visiting his area of operations, and to provide no information to him about the actual situation, but to provide only a positive perspective on the Chetniks, and to discount the Partisans as a resistance force in occupied Serbia. According to the German Foreign Office representative for the Balkans, Hermann Neubacher, Keserović concluded a formal \\"armistice agreement\\" with the Germans in his area of operations in the German-occupied territory of Serbia in late 1943. Such agreements were negotiated by at least four other senior Chetnik commanders in the occupied territory at this time. These agreements ensured that the Chetniks in these areas were safe from the Germans while they continued to fight the Partisans, provided with limited ammunition by the Germans, provided with medical assistance, including having their wounded treated in German hospitals, allowed freedom of movement, and allowed to forcibly recruit manpower in their areas of responsibility. These agreements also required the affected Chetniks to cease operations against the collaborationist puppet regime in the occupied territory, and effectively neutralized these Chetniks as far as the Germans were concerned. On 30 November 1943, Keserović reported to Mihailović that the Germans had offered him cooperation, arms, and ammunition, which he allegedly refused. He denied having any connection with the Germans. = 1944 = One of the elite Chetnik military units which would bear the biggest burden of defense from Tito's advancing communist forces was the Rasina-Toplica Corps Group, commanded by Keserović. This unit was established on 11 May 1944 by the Chetnik Supreme Command. In July, the Germans initiated Operation Trumpf against the Partisans in the southern parts of German-occupied Serbia. This was a combined operation with Bulgarian troops, Serbian quisling formations, and Chetnik forces commanded by Radoslav Račić. Račić's Fourth Group of Shock Corps from western Serbia were reinforced by the Rasina-Kopaonik Group of Shock Corps commanded by Keserović. The total Chetnik forces involved in this operation exceeded 10,000 men, and the Chetniks were supplied with ammunition and some arms by the Germans. In late August 1944, a US Office of Strategic Services mission led by Colonel Robert H. McDowell was parachuted into a Chetnik-controlled area of occupied Serbia to join Mihailović's headquarters, gather general intelligence and establish contacts with representatives of pro-Western forces in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. One member of the mission was Lieutenant Ellsworth Kramer. Kramer was quickly detached to Keserović. Since the situation of the Chetniks seriously deteriorated soon after the mission's arrival, most of McDowell's time was dedicated to the problems faced by the Chetniks, and little if any contact with potential allies in neighboring countries was undertaken. On 1 September 1944, Keserović proclaimed general mobilization. In October 1944, when the Red Army entered occupied Serbia from Bulgaria, some of Keserović's troops met them and briefly occupied the town of Kruševac in central Serbia alongside them. However, within days, the Soviet troops disengaged from the Chetniks and demanded they disarm, threatening to use force if they did not. Keserović reported this to Mihailović on 19 October and refused the ultimatum, withdrawing towards the Ibar River valley with a small detachment of about 500 men. Two of his brigades were disarmed by the Red Army. Those taken into custody included Kramer, who was subsequently released. Keserović himself barely escaped being captured and turned over to the Partisans. During the attack by Chetniks on Axis forces in Tuzla in December 1944, Keserović commanded the right column of the Chetnik forces, while the left column was commanded by Mihailović. In late 1944, Keserović released a captured member of the enemy forces whose name was Alija Izetbegović (who would in 1996 became the first President of Bosnia and Herzegovina), based on intervention by a group of Serbs who informed him that Izetbegović's grandfather had saved the lives of 40 Serbs:\\"Međutim, jedna grupa Srba je došla da intervenira kod tadašnjeg komandanta pukovnika Keserovića. On je bio načelnik Glavnog Štaba. Tad su mi izneli taj podatak da je moj djed spasio 40 Srba i da bi bio dužan da vrati milo za drago. I zahvaljujući toj okolnosti ja sam bio oslobođen.\\" in 1914 during an anti-Serb pogrom that followed the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. = Terror tactics against Partisans and their supporters = In his area of responsibility in occupied Serbia, Keserović used terror tactics against Partisans, their families, and sympathizers, drawing up lists of people and ordering them to be killed. To carry out these killings, special units known as \\"black trojkas\\" were trained and deployed, often using knives to kill their victims. =Capture, trial, and death= Keserović was captured by the Partisans and placed on trial. During the trial, he blamed the Chetnik Supreme Command for most of the actions he was charged with and asserted that he was just carrying out orders. The claim that Keserović denounced Mihailović as collaborator and had broken with him was untrue.:\\"The charge that Dragutin Keserovic had broken with Mihailovich and denounced him as a collaborator was untrue.\\"  Awards and recognitions  * Order of the Star of KarađorđeBiography in the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet References  Sources         * Category:1896 births Category:1945 deaths Category:People from Obrenovac Category:Serbian soldiers Category:Chetnik personnel of World War II Category:Serbian people of World War II Category:Royal Yugoslav Army personnel of World War II Category:Serbian anti-communists Category:Executed military personnel Category:Executed Serbian people Category:People executed by Yugoslavia by firing squad Category:Recipients of the Order of Karađorđe's Star Category:Serbian collaborators with Nazi Germany ","title":"Dragutin Keserović"},{"id":"42173444","text":"Henricus fuscodorsana, the cone cochylid moth, is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

This area is defined by a roughly square bend in the Suncook River, whose power provided an impetus for the development of the town in the 19th century. The dominant feature of the district is the 1827 Joy Cotton Mill, a four-story brick building at the base of Main Street. There are three churches, including the 1863 Gothic Revival St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, and the town office building, a significantly altered 1789 meeting house. The district also includes the main commercial district and some of the surrounding residential areas. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Pittsfield was settled in 1770, when John Cram erected a sawmill on the Suncook River and built his house, now part of the Washington House at the central Washington Square. The first meeting house was built in 1789, roughly midway between his house and mill, the route between these points defining what is now Main Street. Taverns were built near the meeting house soon afterward, creating the nucleus of a town center. In the 19th century, the river's water power was harnessed for use by textile mills, resulting in the construction of both mills and mill worker housing. One boarding house, built in 1827 for single women who worked in an early textile mill, is among the oldest buildings of its type in the state. The arrival of the railroad in 1869 spurred another development boom, in which the shoe industry took hold.

History * In 1970, Brig Gen Roberto Vargas, PRANG, Commander of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard (PRANG), and Mrs. Carmen Colbert organized the 1st Air Base Group with a similar structure to that of the then-156th Tactical Fighter Group's units. At that time the 1 ABG was composed by 25 officers and 4 enlisted personnel. * 1970: Brig Gen Mihel Ghilormini, PRANG, was commissioned by Brig Gen Vargas to command the 1 ABG. * 1982, Col Roberto Montes, PRANG, Commander of the PRANG, started a recruiting effort to manned the PR Air State Guard cadre organization in support of the 156 TFG. * 1986: Col(Ret) Miguel Martoranni, PRANG, former Air Force pilot, became the commander of the 1 ABG. * 1988: Col(Ret) Dennis López, PRANG, former 156 TFG Commander, commanded the 1 ABG. * 1992: Col John J. Gonzalez, PRASG, was named commander of 1 ABG. He had prior service with the US Navy and US Air Force. * 2004: Col Orlando Olivera, PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander. Col Olivera served in the US Army Reserve. * 2010: Col José E. Picó-Del Rosario, PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander by BG(PR) Hector Sorrentini. * 2015: Col Jesus E. (Nesty) Delgado-Morales, PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander by BG(PR) Carlos M. Martinez. * 2018: LtCol. Angel E. Resto, PRASG, was named 1 ABG commander by BG(PR) Edwin I. Rivera-Malave. * 2020: LtCol. Edwin Ramos-Jourdan, PRASG, was named 1st Air Support Group Commander by BG(PR) Ricardo Falcon. 21st century Along with Texas, California and New York, the Puerto Rico State Command is one of the few SDFs that has an air division that embrace the Air Force culture. The 1st Air Support Group, located at Muñiz Air National Guard Base, is an excellent example of integration and teamwork with the PRANG units, especially with the current 156th Wing. The 1st Air Support Group is composed of: * Headquarters Squadron (Unit 700) **Command & Special Staff **Personnel Section **Operations & Training Section * Logistic Squadron (Unit 701) **Transportation Flight **Supply Flight **Aerial Port Flight * Medical Squadron (Unit 702) * Mission Support Squadron (Unit 703) **Civil Engineering Flight **Force Support (Services & FSRT) Flight **Security Forces Flight **Fire Fighter Flight **741st Support Flight **740th Support Flight The 1ASG have two support flights to provide support to the 140th Air Defense Squadron in Punta Salinas and the 141st Air Control Squadron in Punta Borinquén Aguadilla. All 1st Air Support Group units are organized to meet the military training requirements necessary to take over the Puerto Rico Air National Guard installations upon mobilization and deployment of their units. 741st Security Forces working on Main Gate 141ACS The 1st Air Support Group training is conducted in accordance with USAF regulations, which supplements the PRSG and PRNG regulations, directives and guidance. Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs) are performed jointly with PRANG's 156th AW in a consolidated drill concept. These trainings are performed jointly with 156th AW personnel. It allows 1ASG personnel to acquire hands-on experience of what their duty will be if PRANG units are mobilize and deployed. It also gives them the opportunity to be trained by their counterpart in their specialty and get the feeling of a real life scenario, while getting ready for it. These drills are performed concurrently with 156th AW UTA schedule. All 1st Air Support Group units and members attend consolidated drills. This form of UTA's is used to: * Maintain lines of communication among all units * Conduct general military training and OJT with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard counterparts * Conduct Emergency Management training under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Guidelines and the SGAUS's Military Emergency Management Specialist Academy * Conduct promotion and award ceremonies and other special events * General inspections * Practice drills and ceremonies * Maintain Unit Integrity BG Carlos M Martinez meeting with Col Edward L.

Unlike the Civil Air Patrol or the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the PRSG is a statutory military entity of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with each PRSG member subject to the Puerto Rico Code of Military Justice (Law 62). Under state law, enlisted members and officers of the PRSG have the same similar legal status, privileges, and/or immunities as members of the state National Guard (in state status) when called to State Active Duty (SAD) or in drill status. As a state-organized militia, the PRSG ranks are official state military ranks in accordance with the Article 1, Section 8, Clause 16 of the United States Constitution, where the US Congress received the power “to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress”. All PRSG appointments, commissions, warrants, and enlistments are recognized and authorized by the Governor of Puerto Rico through the Adjutant General of PR. The PRSG military personnel render to all members of the military community, and receive from them, all courtesies common to all such members, such as saluting, and forms of address. As a historic milestone for our Unit, From August 13 to 17, 2016, a selected group of nine 1st Air Base Group Civil Engineering Flight traveled and participated in a DFT Mission in support of the US Virgin Island National Guard. During the mission, our airmen performed rehabilitation and maintenance tasks at the USVING Joint Forces Headquarters. The group was excellently led by 1st Lt Alexander De Jesus, 1ABG CEF Commander. They were received, greeted and their outstanding performance was recognized by the USVI TAG, BG (VI) Deborah Howell and her Senior Staff. Uniform 1ABG Security Forces Badge 1ABG Security Forces ABU Patch As approved by the Puerto Rico Adjutant General, the military uniforms worn by the 1st Support Base Group personnel are a variation of the U.S. Air Force's Airman Battle Uniform, the USAF's Service Dress Uniform and the USAF's Mess Dress. 1st Air Base Group members must use the PRSG AIR FORCE distinctive marking on those authorized uniforms. All unit commanders will ensure that all members, individually and collectively, present a professional, well-groomed appearance, which will reflect credit upon PRSG Air Force as the State Guard of the Puerto Rico National Guard. The following Military and USAF Style Specialty Badges are authorized to professional members of the 1st Air Base Group: * Military Emergency Management Specialist (Basic, Senior or Master) * Civil Engineering Badge (Basic, Senior or Master) * Medical Corps Badge (Basic, Senior or Master) * Dental Corps Badge (Basic, Senior or Master) 1ABG Security Forces Beret Flash * Nurse Corps Badge (Basic, Senior or Master) * Chaplain (Christian) Badge * Judge Advocate Badge * Security Forces Badge & Beret Flash * Fire Fighter Badge 1ABG Fire Fighters Badge As a regulation governing the use of those Specialty Badges, the 1ABG published the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) Policy Manual. The CFETP provides information for the Civil Engineer, Medical Corps, Dental Corps, Nurse Corps, Chaplain, Judge Advocate, Emergency Managers, Security Forces and Fire Protection occupational series. That plan outlines desired training, education, and experience to chart and execute a career in those career fields—from entry-level officer/NCO through squadron commander. The CFETP also provides officers, supervisors, and commanders a means to jointly plan and program training and education opportunities. Each officer and NCO should use The CFETP to work with supervisors and commanders to determine appropriate levels and timing of education and training, and ensure they have every opportunity to attend continuing education courses. Every officer or NCO should take the initiative to determine realistic milestones for achieving their goals. Completion of education, training, and experience is a joint responsibility between the officer, their supervisor, and the commander.

The highway connects K-4 west of Marquette and K-140 northeast of Carneiro with Kanopolis Lake. K-141 is a part of the Prairie Trail Scenic Byway, a scenic byway designated to highlight the history, culture, and nature of the area. The highway is a two-lane road its entire length. Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were Auto trails, the northern terminus follows the former Golden Belt. On August 16, 1955, K-141 was designated as a state highway. Between 1961 and 1962, the alignment was straightened and realigned to cross the Kanopolis Lake Dam. On October 13, 1967, U.S. Route 40 (US-40) was rerouted onto Interstate 70 (I-70) from Dorrance to Salina. At that time K-141 was extended from its northern terminus eastward along old US-40 to Salina. This extension was brief because on November 27, 1968, old US-40 from Ellsworth eastward to Salina was designated K-140 and K-141 was truncated to end at the new K-140, its original northern terminus. Route description K-141 is a north-south route with a total length of . The entire route travels primarily through rural grassland. K-141 begins at a southern terminus with K-4 west of the town Marquette. From there, the highway heads north for about through rural farmlands before turning north-northwest. After the turn, K-141 intersects Langley Point Road, which connects the highway to South Shore State Park, then travels along the top of Kanopolis Dam. Immediately after crossing the dam, the highway turns northwest, then gently curves back to a northerly direction as it passes the unincorporated community of Venango. K-141 continues traveling in a northward direction through small rolling hills covered with a mix of grasslands and farmlands until it is south of K-140, at which time it turns northeast, crosses Spring Creek and a Union Pacific Railroad tracks, then turns back north and reaches its northern terminus at K-140 northeast of the unincorporated community of Carneiro. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 455 vehicles per day near the intersection of Avenue M to 520 vehicles per day slightly north of the southern terminus. K-141 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. From the southern terminus northward it is paved with full design bituminous pavement, the next is paved with partial design bituminous pavement and the final is paved with full design bituminous pavement. History Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were Auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. The northern terminus follows the former Golden Belt. Slightly south of the southern terminus was the route of the former Bee Line. On October 6, 1954, the Kansas State Highway Commission, now known as Kansas Department of Transportation, passed a resolution to make Kanopolis Lake Road a state highway as soon as Ellsworth County had brought it up to state highway standards. Then in an August 16, 1955 resolution, it was designated K-141 as the county had finished required projects. Originally K-141 turned east onto Avenue T, southeast of the Kanopolis Lake Dam. After about it turned north at and began to follow 29th Road. It then turned east onto Avenue R then north onto 30th Road later. It then curved west onto Avenue M then met its current alignment about later. Then between 1961 and 1962, the alignment was straightened and realigned to cross the Kanopolis Lake Dam. In an April 25, 1962 resolution, the northernmost of K-141 was realigned to eliminate an inadequate alignment. On October 13, 1967, US-40 was rerouted to overlap the newly constructed section of I-70 from Dorrance to Salina. At that time K-141 was extended from its northern terminus eastward along old US-40 to Salina. This extension was brief because on November 27, 1968, old US-40 from Ellsworth eastward to Salina was designated K-140 and K-141 was truncated to end at the new K-140, its original northern terminus.

It consists of three sets of nine short pieces, one set for each of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday, and a psalm and a hymn. The work was written for unaccompanied voices: two soprano parts, alto, two tenor parts, and bass. The texts of the Responsories for Holy Week are related to Jesus's Passion and are sung in between the lessons at Tenebrae. Gesualdo's settings are stylistically madrigali spirituali - madrigals on sacred texts. As in Gesualdo's later books of madrigals, he uses particularly sharp dissonance and shocking chromatic juxtapositions, especially in the parts highlighting text passages having to do with Christ's suffering, or the guilt of St. Peter in having betrayed Jesus.

There follows music of profound loneliness, radiant chords punctured by aching dissonances, as Jesus says, “I will go to be sacrificed for you.” The movement from inner to outer landscape, from chromatic counterpoint to block harmonies, humanizes Jesus in a way that calls to mind Caravaggio’s New Testament paintings of the same period, with their collisions of dark and light.\\"Alex Ross. \\"Gesualdo: 'The Prince of Darkness'\\" in The New Yorker.

It is one of the largest local government associations in the United States. The MTA was formed in 1953 and now claims nearly 99% of Michigan's 1,240 townships as members.MichiganTownships.org ::: THE ASSOCIATION Mission The MTA's mission is to help township officials govern more effectively and provide improved services to the 4 million plus Michigan township residents. The association provides classes, educational conferences, and publications to aid their members' understanding of statutory duties. The MTA also seeks to influence legislation in Michigan by representing townships before the Michigan Legislature. History In 1952, Kalamazoo Township (Kalamazoo Co.) was involved in an annexation battle with the City of Kalamazoo. During that time, Kalamazoo Township Clerk Joe Parisi and other township officials began pondering the foundation of an organization to provide information to townships, as well as impact legislation at the state Capitol. Parisi spent most of the next year traveling around the state, meeting with township officials, and receiving advice and recommendations about the formation of a Michigan organization for townships. After the trip concluded, the supervisors and clerks of all 16 townships in Kalamazoo County and supervisors from Allegan, Berrien, Calhoun and St. Joseph counties met at the Kalamazoo Township hall. Following much discussion the group decided they would support the effort to organize statewide. http://www.michigantownships.org Temporary officers were elected including Portage Township (now the City of Portage) Clerk Claus Schuring as president, Parisi as secretary, and a steering committee composed of Comstock Township (Kalamazoo Co.) Supervisor Clarence Neal, Alamo Township (Kalamazoo Co.) Trustee Leonard Newton and Cooper Township (Kalamazoo Co.) Treasurer Leon Wagner. As word of the new organization spread, Parisi began meeting with local and state government officials who agreed to attend a meeting on October 6, 1953, to formally organize the townships association. More than 700 township officials gathered in Lansing to be addressed by Parisi in the main ballroom of the former Olds Hotel, where the group voted unanimously to form the association. At the meeting’s conclusion, Redford Township (Wayne Co.) Supervisor Leonard Broquet was elected president, and Governor G. Mennen Williams offered his congratulations and best wishes for the future of the newly formed Michigan Townships Association (MTA). MTA moved to Lansing in 1957, when Parisi decided not to seek re-election as township clerk and serve as the executive director full-time. During the mid-1960s, MTA experienced a period of phenomenal growth. Because of its achievements in strengthening township government, the Association became more important to township officials and found itself in need of expanding its services. In addition to advocacy, the MTA began offering scheduled training classes and legal information services. As District Meetings were drawing to a close in 1973, Parisi was stricken with a heart attack. In an effort to ensure the Association ran smoothly in spite of the executive director’s absence, Robert R. Robinson, the MTA’s legislative director, and the Board of Directors assumed leadership. Eventually, Robinson, a former MTA President and supervisor of Meridian Township (Ingham County), was named MTA’s second executive director. In 1983, John (Jack) M. La Rose became the Association’s third executive director. Concurrent with La Rose’s appointment, Robinson assumed a newly created full-time position as associate director. La Rose was originally hired in 1978 as executive assistant. He was later made deputy executive director to prepare for Robinson’s retirement. In 1987, the MTA Board approved the purchase of a new office site on almost 10 wooded acres in Delta Charter Township. Due to careful financial planning, the new site and building had a minimal impact on MTA membership contributions. MTA won an Award of Excellence from the American Society of Association Executives for its financial planning for the new headquarters. Upon La Rose’s retirement in 2000, G. Larry Merrill became MTA’s fourth executive director. He served as deputy executive director since 1985, but was originally hired in 1980 as director of education. Merrill’s focus has been to support the efforts of the MTA board to govern at a strategic, forward-thinking level. In 2003, MTA celebrated its 50th Anniversary with an open house, special events at its Annual Educational Conference, a fireworks show over Mackinac Island during its Summer Legislative Conference, and burying a time capsule, along with dedication of a garden memorializing the contributions of former executive directors Joe Parisi and Bob Robinson. Membership MTA is not a governmental entity but is a 501(c)4 nonprofit, voluntary membership association for Michigan’s 1,240 townships. The Association provides services including speaking on behalf of townships to state and federal lawmakers, answering questions on statutory requirements and providing solutions, and offering education programs to build knowledge and skills for township officials. What townships do State laws authorize Michigan townships to perform a wide variety of functions in two important categories: mandated and permissive. Mandated functions are activities that townships are required to perform. The three broadest mandated responsibilities are assessment administration, elections administration and tax collection, which are legally assigned functions of the supervisor, clerk and treasurer, respectively. State laws also specify details for performing these functions. In addition to these broad mandates, there are other, more narrow state requirements. Procedures for the township’s financial administration, such as budgets, accounting, investments and deposits, are closely regulated by the state. Township meetings must comply with Michigan’s Open Meetings Act,MCL 15.261, et seq. and township records must be stored and made available in conformance with specific laws, such as the Freedom of Information Act.MCL 15.231, et seq. Beyond the mandated functions, Michigan townships are authorized to provide a wide variety of services that are generally expected from general purpose governmental entities. Virtually all townships provide fire protection and many also offer law enforcement as well. Parks and recreation programs, public water and sewer services, trash collection and recycling programs, sidewalks and trails, and cemeteries are other common township functions. Townships, as well as other local governments, can provide these services by themselves, or jointly with another entity, and townships can buy from and sell to other governments any function it can produce by itself. In some but not all cases, townships can also contract with private entities to provide programs and services. Townships have broad powers to enact and enforce ordinances. Zoning ordinances regulate land use, while many other “police power,” non-zoning ordinances control activities that protect the health, safety and general welfare of the community. A significant difference between townships and cities and villages in Michigan is the general lack of authority in townships to perform maintenance and construction on roads. In most states, townships take care of local roads in their jurisdictions, but Michigan law transferred responsibility for roads to county road commissions and, most recently, provides the option for county boards of commissioners to transfer road responsibility from road commissions to themselves. Under very specific circumstances, larger townships may contract with road commissions to assume road maintenance responsibilities, but only one township has opted to accept road responsibilities to this degree. Townships do not receive gas and weight tax distributions as cities, villages and counties do. It is the county’s statutory responsibility to keep roads in a safe condition, but township boards recognize that counties do not have sufficient resources to take care of all the road needs. As a result, townships collectively spent in excess of $160 million on roads in 2010, even though they are not required by law to do so. The Michigan Constitution and state statutes limit the amount of property tax millage that townships can levy for general township operations. General law townships are allocated at least 1 mill from the constitutionally limited 15/18 mills allocated among townships, the county, public schools and the intermediate school district. Charter townships, like cities, do not share in this allocated millage, but townships chartered by a referendum may levy up to 5 mills. Townships chartered by board resolution after Nov. 22, 1978, must have a vote of the electors authorizing the levy of up to 5 mills. In either case, the 5-mill limit may be increased up to 10 mills with a vote of the electors. Townships also utilize other sources of revenue to support services. User fees, permits, fines and special assessments on real property are the most frequently used sources. Townships serve other governmental units by providing tax collection services. To avoid imposing an unnecessary burden on citizens to pay separate property taxes to the township, schools, special assessment districts and the county, Michigan townships provide uniform assessment of property values and collect all property taxes on behalf of the other units of government. Only a very small portion of the taxes collected are retained by the township for its own operating purposes. Michigan townships, large and small, provide services tailored to meet the needs of their residents. Township officials represent the level of government closest and most responsive to the wishes of the people.

Location Rathborney parish is in the Barony of Burren, from the village of Burren on the road to Ennistymon. It is SSW of Ballyvaughan and includes territory in the valley of Ballyvaughan, the slopes of surroundings hills and the side valley of the Rathborney river (also known as Feenagh Valley). The parish is , and covers . The highest point is Cappanavulla hill, on the northern boundary, at above sea level. Much of the parish is rocky hill pasture, and there is some blanket bog in the west of the parish. Demographics In 1841, the parish had a population of 1,000 in 177 houses. Antiquities Faunarooska wedge tomb The parish includes numerous prehistoric and historic sites, including several ringforts such as the earthen Ballyallaban ringfort and the limestone Cahermore ringfort. At Cahermacnaghten stands the central cashel of the O'Davoran family with the ruins of their law school nearby. In Faunarooska townland there are several wedge tombs. In Gleninsheen townland, the Gleninsheen Gorget was discovered in 1932. There are also remains of more wedge tombs, known as the Gleninsheen wedge tombs. There are two church ruins within 500 m of each other, both in Croagh North townland. One is known as Glenaraha (Gleann na Ratha or Valley of the Ráths or Ringforts), with a ringfort (Doontorpa) nearby. It is a large t-shaped church with a vestry to the east. According to a sign in the west annexe, it was built in 1795 by the 1st Marquess of Buckinghham for use by his tenants. By 1837 the church had been enlarged and 40 acres of land allotted for use by the parish priest. The other church is known as Rathborney Church, from Ráth Bhoirne (the Ráth of the Burren) and was built inside the remains of another ringfort. Most of the remains date to the 15th century, when a smaller earlier church was almost completely rebuilt. Parts of the east and north wall date to that original structure. Later features include the ornate east window and the pointed arch of the doorway in the south wall. A graveyard surrounds the church and it includes several crude grave markers of unknown date. There is also a bullaun. Its presence and the fact that the original church was built before 1302 inside a ringfort may indicate a monastic origin for this site. The church ruin both inside and out is an active much loved graveyard private to local families. There is a church in the village suitable for wedding ceremonies. On 24 July 2017, Benjamin Serinsky and Samantha Hassard \\"tied the knot\\" at Rathborney Church with Dara Molloy as their officiant. They were joined by their parents, Samantha's best friend, and Blackie O'Connell, who played the uilleann pipes. It was a beautiful ceremony, which was followed by pints at O'Loclainn's pub, a photography adventure around the burren, and a superb meal at Gregans Castle Hotel. The rebuilt tower house and hotel of Gregans Castle are located in the parish, in the townlands of Gregan West and Gregan East, respectively. Townlands and hamlets The parish contains the townlands of Ballyallaban, Berneens, Burrenwee, Cahermacnaghten, Cahermacun, Cloonmartin, Cullaun, Cregavockoge, Croagh North, Croagh South, Donnyvardan, Drumbrickaun, Faunarooska, Feenagh, Garracloon, Gleninsheen, Gragan East, Gragan West, Lisgoogan, Lislarheenmore, Lismacsheedy, Lismacteige, Lissylisheen, Poulacapple and Poulnabrucky.

It was founded in 1899. History and functions The ISHS was created as an entity with the original purpose of gathering and publishing materials on paper relating to Illinois' early history. American Civil War veterans and the grandchildren of the state's early settlers were eager to learn how Illinois had organized itself in the years prior to the 1860 presidential election of Abraham Lincoln. As time passed, the focus of the Society shifted from books to periodicals and symposia. Affiliated and independent scholars were given a venue to publish their findings. As paved highway mileage increased in Illinois in the early 1900s, the ISHS began to build and maintain state highway historic markers. The Society's work continued to focus on pioneer years and the 19th century. Although historically affiliated with the state government of Illinois and the agencies that developed into the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, the ISHS was emancipated in 1997 and fully launched into the private sector. As of 2014, the ISHS publishes the quarterly Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, a scholarly publication, and the bimonthly Illinois Heritage, a newsletter with short historical features. The Society holds meetings and symposia, and offers small prizes and scholarships for continued work and studies in Illinois history, with growing emphasis on the social history of the 20th century in Illinois.

It was last assigned to the Central Flying Training Command, and was disbanded on 30 December 1945 at Fort Worth Army Airfield, Texas. There is no lineage between the current United States Air Force 31st Fighter Wing, established on 6 November 1947 at Turner Army Airfield, Georgia, and this organization. The squadron was a World War II Command and Control unit, its mission to flying training units of the Army Air Forces Training Command. Headquartered at Enid Army Airfield, Oklahoma for most of its operational service, it controlled contract pilot schools primarily in the Central United States. History Until 1939, the Army Air Corps provided all flying training with military instructor pilots. Beginning in 1939, it contracted with nine civilian flying schools to provide primary flight training. Primary training consisted of a three-month course of 65 hours of flying instruction. As the United States prepared to enter World War II by expanding its number of flying squadrons, the number of contract primary schools increased.Manning, Thomas A. (2005), History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942–2002. Office of History and Research, Headquarters, AETC, Randolph AFB, Texas ASIN: B000NYX3PC According to the contract, the government supplied students with training aircraft, flying clothes, textbooks, and equipment. The Air Corps also put a detachment at each school to supervise training. The schools furnished instructors, training sites and facilities, aircraft maintenance, quarters, and mess halls. From the Air Corps, schools received a flat fee of $1,170 for each graduate and $18 per flying hour for students eliminated from training. The Primary Pilot Training used Boeing PT-17 or Fairchild PT-19 two-seater single-engine training aircraft. Also, the wing controlled specialized schools for Liaison Pilots using the Stinson L-5 Grasshopper, and Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) primary training was conducted exclusively at Avenger Field, Sweetwater, Texas. Following the fall of France in 1940, the Air Corps upped its pilot production goal to 7,000 per year. To meet that goal, the Air Corps increased the capacity of its schools and added more contract primary schools. The vast majority of contract primary pilot training ended in the spring of 1944 as part of the rundown of Army pilot training. The ones remaining open ended their operations in October 1945. = Lineage= * Established as 31st Flying Training Wing on 17 December 1942 : Activated on 16 January 1943 : Disbanded on 30 December 194531st Flying Training Wing, lineage and history document Air Force Historical Agency, Maxwell AFB, Alabama =Assignments= * Army Air Forces Gulf Coast Training (later, AAF Central Flying Training) Command, 16 January 1943 – 30 December 1945 =Stations= * Chickasha, Oklahoma trained 8,000 troops at the Wilson and Bonfis Flying School that opened in October 1941, after the war it became Chickasha Municipal Airport. * Enid Army Airfield, Oklahoma, 16 January 1943 * Fort Worth Army Airfield, Texas, 31 May-30 December 1945 =Training aircraft= CPS Primary Trainers were primarily PT-17 Stearman biplanes and Fairchild PT-19s monoplanes, although a wide variety of other types could be found at the airfields.

Mudie-Cooke served as an ambulance driver in both France and Italy during the conflict and these experiences were reflected in her artwork. Life and work In an Ambulance: a VAD lighting a cigarette for a patient (Art.IWM ART 3051), painted between 1916 and 1918 Mudie-Cooke was born in west London, the younger of two daughters to Henry Cooke, a carpet merchant, and Beatrice Mudie. She studied art at St John's Wood Art School and at Goldsmith's College. She also worked in Venice for a brief period. In January 1916 Mudie-Cooke and her elder sister Phyllis, who had studied Archaeology, went to France as volunteer members of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, FANY. Whilst driving ambulances for FANY, and later for a Voluntary Aid Detachment unit, in France between 1916 and 1918, Mudie-Cooke began to sketch and paint the scenes she saw around her, both among her fellow ambulance drivers and the medical staff they were working with. In particular her watercolours and chalk drawings often focused on wounded troops being evacuated, and the logistics of evacuation such as ambulance trains waiting in sidings. As well as the Western Front Mudie-Cooke also served as an ambulance driver in Italy during the war. Mudie-Cooke was fluent in French, Italian and German and so sometimes worked as an interpreter for the Red Cross. In 1919 Mudie-Cooke came to the attention of the Women's Work Sub-Committee of the newly formed Imperial War Museum which acquired a number of her paintings for its fledgling collection. This purchase included her most famous picture, In an Ambulance:a VAD lighting a cigarette for a patient. In 1920 the British Red Cross commissioned her to return to France to record the activities of the Voluntary Aid Detachment units who were still providing care and relief there. Her paintings from this visit include examples of war damage, the shattered landscapes of the former battlefields and women tending graves in a cemetery. Mudie-Cooke worked mostly in watercolours, painting in a fluid style but often with a somewhat murky palette of colours. Mudie-Cooke returned to Newlyn in Cornwall and continued working as an artist and held an exhibition of her work in 1921 at the Cambridge University Architectural Society. From 1920 onwards, Mudie-Cooke travelled extensively throughout Europe and Africa, most notably to South Africa where she held an exhibition of her work in 1923. She returned to England for a short period before going to France in 1925 where she took her life. An exhibition of her work was held at the Beaux-Arts Gallery the next year and some years later her sister Phyllis donated more of her works to the Imperial War Museum.

He became internationally famous as an anti-EU austerity and pro-Italexit politician because he strongly opposed the Monti Cabinet since November 2011 when at that time almost all politicians, journalists, economists and public opinion were in favor of EU austerity and strongly against Italexit. Crosetto was President of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) from 21 December 2012 to 4 April 2013. Biography Guido Crosetto comes from a family of entrepreneurs from Cuneo, in Piedmont. Due to his father's death, Crosetto could not finish studies in economy at the University of Turin, which he had been attending: at the University he became a member of the youth wing of the Christian Democracy (DC) and in 1988, at only 25 years, Crosetto became economic advisor of Prime Minister Giovanni Goria. Crosetto from 28 May 1990 to 14 June 2004 was the Mayor of Marene, a small village near Cuneo where he lives, for 3 terms.In the comune of Marene the office of Mayor before 1995 was elected by the Comunal Council (indirect election) without term limits, after 1995 the Mayor is elected by citizen (direct election) with term limits (only two consecutive terms); before 1995 the term of the Major of Marene was five years, from 1995 to 1999 the term was only four years, after 1999 the term is five years. In the 2001 general election he became a deputy of Forza Italia (FI), the center- right political movement member of EPP and founded by the billionaire and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi. Crosetto was re-elected in 2006 as deputy and in 2008 he joined the new Berlusconi's party The People of Freedom (PdL) and he was elected again at the Chamber of Deputies. Crosetto served as Undersecretary at the Ministry of Defense in the Berlusconi IV Cabinet (2008-2011) and after Berlusconi's resignation in November 2011, Crosetto criticized the formation of the new cabinet led by pro-austerity economist Mario Monti. He founded in December 2012, with Giorgia Meloni and Ignazio La Russa, Brothers of Italy (FdI), a national conservative party in opposition to the PdL and to the pro-austerity Monti. Candidate for Senate, Crosetto failed the 2013 election because FdI did not passed the threshold at 3% of the electoral law known as Porcellum. Crosetto run in 2014 for the EU Parliament, but he was not elected because FdI did not passed the threshold at 4% of the electoral law of 2009 for European election in Italy. On the same day of EU election, Crosetto ran in the Regional election of Piedmont as gubernatiorial candidate for FdI that ran alone outside the center-right coalition led by Berlusconi's FI: in this election, Salvini's Lega Nord was allied with FI against FdI, but after the retirement of Crosetto from politics in September 2014 Salvini became more closer to Giorgia Meloni's FdI because without Crosetto the party moved to the right-wing, while FI (member of EPP) moved towards the center. Crosetto returned active in politics when the deputy Daniela Santanchè, a right-wing businesswoman and former member of PdL-FI in Lombardy, joined Meloni's FdI in December 2017. Crosetto and Santanchè in FdI represented the small and medium-sized enterprises of Northern Italy in the 2018 general election and they became respectively member of Montecitorio (the Italian Chamber of Deputies) and Senate because the party increased its electoral support surpassing the 4,3% of votes for the first time at national level. Crosetto resigned on 13 March 2019 from Montecitorio and after two days his former seat was assigned to the first candidate on the list of non-elected at the 2018 general election, that is the businesswoman (and member of FdI) Lucrezia Mantovani. Crosetto in April and May 2019, as non-candidate spokesman of the party, helped Meloni in the campaign for the European Election and FdI (who became a member of ECR) increased its electoral support surpassing the 6,4% of votes for the first time at national level.

Instructional materials can be \\"a smorgasbord of teaching modules and exercises developed by other open-learning projects. . . Interactive-learning Web sites and even instructional videos on YouTube . . .\\" However, OCL is not an OER publishing project, although it did contribute to the development of some widely used resources. Goals include: lowering textbook costs for students, providing new resources for faculty to use in their courses; and fully engaging in the global OER or open educational resources discussion. The project was funded by matching grants of $750,000 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Washington State legislature. In 2009–2010 the affected Washington State student body totaled 470,000 and was increasing. Many of the materials made available are open educational resources or OERs. Specifically, they include syllabi, course activities, readings, and assessments and some are paired with low cost textbooks, costing $30 or less. In subjects across the sciences and humanities, the OCL team created curriculum support for Washington State's most popular 81 courses in the state's 34 community and technical colleges. Instructors were free to use the materials as they wish, in part or an entire course. The project was headed by Cable Green, then eLearning Director for the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges. It emerged from a two-year discussion that ultimately produced a Strategic Technology Plan. The plan outlines a unified vision known as Washington Student Completion Initiative. Process and organizational structure OCL participants were selected from a grant proposal competition. The process, which led to production of the materials, was open and several preliminary Town Meetings were used employing Eluminate Live. All participants were welcome. The meetings are archived. Topics for discussion included interactions with publishers, content presentation, copyright policies, and various Creative Commons licenses. Successful applicants received $15,000 to complete a course redesign. Librarians, instructional designers and institutional researchers were also asked to apply. Like faculty, these successful applicants also received grants of $15,000. Each winning faculty member or team designed a ready-to-use digital course module. Teams were composed of community college instructors, librarians, and web-designers. In fall 2011 the first 42 courses created were released. The use of OCL materials is not mandated for Washington's community colleges and technical schools. Faculty course designers, however, are asked to adopt what they have designed. There were over 25,000 visits from 125 countries over the first four months. Nonetheless, there have been challenges: good material is not always available online for adoption and sometimes the best materials (for instance translations of primary sources published in foreign languages) are not available free. Resource availability Courses are made accessible using the WashingtonOnline learning system. Externally, OCL partners with the Saylor Foundation, the Connexions Consortium, and the Open Courseware Consortium. The Saylor site can be used access course content by self-learners. Open Course Library and Open Educational Resources A goal of the project requires instructors to become aware of the open educational resources (OERs) that are already available. A complementary goal is to share their content and adaptation by contributing to a global effort. Both directly and indirectly, Cable Green, the project's then director, observed that it has resulted in the building of networks with like-minded individuals and institutions irrespective of geography. An interest was also expressed in gauging use of materials and modules for the tenure and advancement of participants. Reasons for the effort A 2009 New York Times article reported that college students spend between $700 and $1,000 annually on textbooks. Full-time tuition in the Washington system is approximately $3,000 annually, with textbooks costing approximately $1,000 annually. Community college tuition is lower than at most traditional four-year institutions, and, therefore, textbook costs may be proportionally higher. Any number of digital copies of a free textbook can be made for the price of one. Print-on demand copies generally cost under $10. Representative Reuven Carlyle (D-Seattle, Washington House of Representatives) estimates that because of OCL community college students saved over $1.25 million in textbook costs during the 2011–2012 school year. OCL seeks to contribute to the creation of better courses and to reduce costs for students. In this way it seeks to respond positively to the \\"completion\\" concerns outlined in the state's tipping point research report of 2008. On 17 June 2010 the Washington State Board for Community & Technical Colleges (SBCTC) approved a state-level open licensing policy. All digital works created using grant funds administered by SBCTC must now carry a Creative Commons Attribution-only (CC BY) license. This license allows materials created by one institution to be updated by another. It was within this context that OCL was launched in 2010. Nicole Allen, a textbook advocate for the national Student Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) commended the state for putting its money where its mouth is. Effectiveness assessment The results are reported in Affordable Textbooks for Washington Students: An Updated Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library (2013), an update of Affordable Textbooks for Washington's Students: A Cost Analysis of the Open Course Library (2011). The latter reported on the first phase of courses in October 2011. In April 2013 the State Board announced the completion of all 81 courses and the updated report was released. The report concluded: * OCL has saved students $5,500,000 since inception. * OCL materials cost 90% less than previously used materials. The average OCL material costs $12, replacing the average priced $135 traditional item. * Students taking OCL courses save on average $96 per course. * Student savings are more than three times the original $1,800,000 invested. * Two examples: By switching over to OCL material two community colleges have saved students $197,395 and $162,848 respectively. * Future Savings: A 2011 analysis projects savings as much as $41.6 if materials are adopted by all 410,000 enrolled students. On the other hand, in January 2014 The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that the effort to make free or low cost materials available in 42 courses was making little progress. Based on a survey of community-college stores, with responses from 25 campuses, only nine said that any materials had been used in 17 of the 42 courses. Only 2,386 of the 98,130 students enrolled in these courses, in 75 of the eligible 2,722 sections, used the materials. In 16 of the 75 sections students paid nothing; in the other 59 sections the average cost was $25. These numbers reported the work of OnCampus Research, an arm of the National Association of College Stores, which in fall 2013 sent a survey to 34 campus stores in the Washington Community and Technical College system. The survey focused on the first 42, or phase one, courses. It showed, according to the director of OnCampus Research, \\"that the recommendation of specific free or lower-priced course materials for popular courses did not equate to significant use of these materials by faculty.\\" However, Marty Brown, executive director of the Washington State Board of Community and Technical Colleges, took exception in a Chronicle of Higher Education piece he explained: \\"The study analyzes the use of OCL materials based on adoption information from campus bookstores. This methodology provides an incomplete picture, as bookstores are not always aware when faculty members assign free, digital resources. Therefore, the study's findings do not justify its conclusion that OCL has resulted in \\"insignificant\\" savings to students. The Student PIRGs estimates the OCL has saved students more than $5.5-million, more than triple the original investment. We believe this is very significant.\\" SPARC referred to the same presumed misunderstanding. One reviewer states that OCL is best at \\"presenting introductory college course material in a condensed, simple manner via Google docs or presentations.\\" It is noted, however, that the materials are not highly refined. Further observing that \\"there's something to be said about grabbing an algebra quiz or those French vocabulary words quickly.\\" A doctoral dissertation focused specifically on the project concludes in its abstract: \\". . . that while faculty may be motivated to adopt new innovations like OER, for some, the time it takes to identify and integrate OER into courses presents a significant barrier to adoption.\\" Long-term impact Washington State communities have integrated OCL into educational efforts in innovative ways. For instance, Bellevue College, Washington, the state's largest community college, with help with a grant from the U.S. Department of Education, purchased 500 inexpensive netbook laptop computers in November 2011 for its students to rent for $35 per quarter to \\"download and read Internet material.\\" The anticipation was that the machines would also be used with OCL material. Since its initiation, OCL is credited with inspiring open textbook initiatives by the legislatures of California (2012), British Columbia (2012) and actions by the legislatures of Illinois, Minnesota, and Virginia all similar to California's. North Dakota proposed a resolution asking faculty and college administrations to support the use of open textbooks. Further, the Trade Adjustment Community College and Career Training grants program requires that all material created using federal funds be available to the public through an open license. Materials produced through this vehicle will be added to the OCL. The Saylor Foundation will create modular versions of the courses. Project Kaleidoscope intends to modify OCL materials to meet the needs of California's community college students. The department of education in São Paulo Brazil plans Portuguese translations of the courses.

During the war, McLeod worked in a factory in Michigan. He continued to write songs during the war and resumed his career at WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee once the war had ended. He was with the station until 1957, appearing both solo and as Mac and Little Addie. McLeod was with the Mercury Records label from 1949 until 1952, leaving to join King Records. He wrote numerous songs throughout his career, including \\"The Battle of Armageddon\\" which was recorded by Hank Williams. Additional songs included \\"Thirty Pieces of Silver\\" made popular by Wilma Lee Cooper, and \\"From the Manger to the Cross\\" sung by Hank Williams, both of which became country music standards. Later life McLeod moved to Benton Harbor, Michigan in 1957 where he became the business owner of \\"Odell Signs.\\" He had given up songwriting at this time before suffering a heart attack in 1974 which led him to give up his business. In the late 1970s, he began writing and performing again, penning new songs as well as re-recording some of his earlier songs for the Folk Variety label of Germany. He traveled to the Netherlands in the 1980s where he and Addie toured with A.G. and Kate, a popular gospel duo. He died on January 11, 2003 at his home in Benton Harbor, Berrien County, Michigan.

The library houses the largest collection of works written in Faroese, works written by Faroese in other languages or translated by them, and works written about the Faroe Islands. History The library began in 1828, when the Danish Amtmaður (governor) Christian Ludvig Tillisch (in office 1825-30) and his Amtsrevisor Jens Davidsen began assembling books for a Færø Amts Bibliotek (Danish, 'Faroe County Library'). They were assisted by the Danish scholar Carl Christian Rafn and by private citizens, and on 5 November 1828 secured an annual grant of funds from the King. In 1831, the collection included 2,860 volumes. The library acquired its own building in 1830, and Jens Davidsen served as librarian until his death in 1878.Søga og endamál , Um Landsbókasavnið, National Library of the Faroe Islands, archived at the Wayback Machine, 14 December 2013 By 1850 there were approximately 5,000 books, but the project stagnated between 1878 and 1905, when the Faroese parliament, the Løgting, assigned funding. The library flourished beginning in 1921, under the linguist Mads Andreas Jacobsen (1891-1944), who had trained as a librarian in 1920. During the period of the Faroese language conflict, it became a rallying point for national writers and politicians. It moved into a new building in 1931. After the achievement of home rule in 1948, the Løgting greatly increased financial support for the library and its official name became Faroese. The library underwent renewed expansion and under a law passed on 16 June 1952 is a depository library: publishers are legally required to deposit four copies of all printed materials in the collection. Since 24 September 1980 the library has been housed at J. C. Svabosgøta 16 on Viðarlundin á Debesartrøð park, in a purpose-built building designed by Jákup Pauli Gregoriussen.

Life He was the son of Thomas Sadler, unitarian minister of Horsham in Sussex, and was born there on 5 July 1822. He was educated at University College, London, studied for some months in Bonn, and went on to the University of Erlangen, whence he graduated Ph.D. in 1844. He entered the Unitarian ministry at Hackney, but migrated in 1846 to become minister of Rosslyn Hill Chapel in Hampstead, London, where he stayed for the remaining 45 years of his life. Through Sadler's efforts, a new chapel on Rosslyn Hill was opened on 5 June 1862. He died at Rosslyn Manse on 11 September 1891, and was buried on the 16th in Highgate cemetery. At the time of his death he was the senior trustee of Dr. Williams's Library, and visitor of Manchester New College. Works In 1859 Sadler published Gloria Patri: the Scripture Doctrine of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in which he defended the Unitarian position against the views expressed in Rock of Ages by Edward Henry Bickersteth. James Martineau preached the opening discourse of the new Rosslyn Hill Chapel; it was printed, with Sadler's sermon on the closing of the old chapel, and an appendix on the former ministers of Hampstead. Sadler was specially interested in the history of the older English presbyterianism. His tastes led to a commission, in 1867, to edit Henry Crabb Robinson's Diaries. The work appeared in 1869, and went to a third edition in 1872; but only a small portion of the Crabb Robinson papers were used utilised. With some devotional works, Sadler was also author of Edwin T. Field: a memorial sketch, 1872; The Man of Science and Disciple of Christ, a funeral speech for William Benjamin Carpenter, 1885; and Prayers for Christian Worship, 1886.

He was a son of Ignacy Matuszewski, Sr., a well-known literary critic. A strong supporter of Józef Piłsudski, he was counted among the \\"Colonels\\" and co-founded the Józef Piłsudski Institute of America. He was also the godson of writer, Bolesław Prus.  Life  Ignacy Matuszewski studied philosophy at the Jagiellonian University, architecture in Milan, law in Tartu, and agriculture in Warsaw. During World War I Matuszewski was one of the executors of Piłsudski's concept in the Russian Empire. From December 1914, he served in the Russian Army, among others as commander of an intelligence troop. After the February Revolution in 1917, he organized the Assembly of Free Poles in Saint Petersburg and participated in the formation of the Polish Corps in Russia. In December 1917 he joined the Polish I Corps in Russia under the command of General Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki. In the early 1918, Matuszewski received a default death sentence from the Bolsheviks. In response to this threat, he captured Minsk, chasing away the Bolshevik garrison, on February 18, 1918. Two days later, he became the commander of the city. Since the Germans had also sentenced him to death, he decided to move to Kiev. In April 1918, Matuszewski joined the Polish Military Organisation. In May 1918, he participated in the coup directed against General Dowbor- Muśnicki, who wanted to hand control of the Polish I Corps to the Germans at the fortress of Bobrujsk. After the coup failed and the Germans disarmed the Corps, Matuszewski was back in Kiev. Following the regaining of independence by Poland in November 1918, Matuszewski was transferred to the Second Unit of the General Staff of the Polish Army, of which he became chief at the culmination of the Polish-Bolshevik War. After the Bolshevik defeat, Józef Piłsudski summarized the espionage activity of Matuszewski in the following words: \\"It was the first war since many centuries waged by Poland during which we [Poland] knew more about the enemy than the enemy knew about us.\\" Matuszewski participated in the talks that resulted in the 1921 Treaty of Riga. From November 2, 1923 until October 15, 1924, Matuszewski was a listener of the III Training Course at the Wyższa Szkoła Wojenna in Warsaw. After the completion of the course and obtaining of an officer's diploma at the General Staff of the Army, he was appointed military attaché in Rome by the Minister of Military Affairs. On December 1, 1924, he was named elder colonel as of August 15, 1924, and ranked nineteenth in the infantry officers' corps. He was moved to the reserves in 1926. After the May Coup of 1926, Matuszewski was one of the leading representatives of the right-wing among the followers of Marshal Józef Piłsudski. During 1926-28, he served as a Polish representative in Budapest. During 1929-31, he was director of the Ministry of Finance and Minister of Finance in the five following governments (from the cabinet of Kazimierz Świtalski until the second cabinet of Walery Sławek). Between 1932 and 1936, he was the leading publicist of Gazeta Polska (Polish Gazette), whose print run was 35,000 during that period. After Matuszewski's resignation from the newspaper's editing staff, the printing run fell by half. He was also the leading editor of Polityka Narodów, a monthly that analyzed geopolitics, foreign policies of foreign powers, international situation and the place of Poland in the world. In 1937, Matuszewski was awarded the Golden Wawrzyn Akademicki (Academic Laurel) by the Polish Academy of Literature for his \\"services for the good of literature.\\". In March 1938, Matuszewski accurately predicted the outbreak of World War II and its fatal consequences for Poland. On the pages of the Słowo Lwowskie (a Vilnus newspaper), the ex-Minister of Finance launched a campaign for the increase in the Polish military budget and for the formation of three armored divisions. After the Germans had captured Prague on March 15, 1939, he wrote an article in Polityka Gospodarcza calling for the doubling of the size of the Polish Army. The anxious government elite had Matuszewski's text promptly confiscated, but it still appeared in a slightly changed form in Słowo. He was a pessimist, whom Józef Beck did not want to listen to. He had worried that the war would be an unprecedented catastrophe for Poland. The war émigré Władysław Studnicki would later confirm the colonel's critical attitude toward Beck. Matuszewski thought that Poland could not afford a war with Germany, as the Germans had an enormous military advantage. On the eve of the September Campaign of 1939 he said: \\"we must lose this war miserably within three months.\\" He also anticipated the destruction of the Republic by the two aggressors, i.e., Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. In September 1939, he organized, together with Henryk Floyar-Rajchman, the operation to evacuate 75 tons of gold from the Polish National Bank through Romania, Turkey and Syria to France, where he and his wife Halina Konopacka, who assisted him, handed it over to the Polish Government-in-Exile. Removed from service by the government of Władysław Sikorski and compelled by the capitulation of France in June 1940, he set out to seek refuge in the United States. He and Konopacka finally arrived there in September 1941, having traveled through Spain, Portugal and Brazil. He was opposed to the policies of Władysław Sikorski toward the Soviet Union, for example the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, which he criticized in his writing. Together with Wacław Jędrzejewicz and Henryk Floyar-Rajchman, Matuszewski co-founded the National Committee of Americans of Polish Extraction (KNAPP) and the Józef Piłsudski Institute of America. He worked to persuade Polish public opinion in the U.S. to oppose the policy of concessions to Joseph Stalin. He died in New York City on August 3, 1946. He was survived by Konopacka, who subsequently remarried. \\"His greatest joy in life,\\" confessed Bohdan Podoski after Matuszewski's death, \\"was his only daughter, Ewa. He once gave her that which he valued the most: the Cross of Virtuti Militari once awarded to his great- grandfather, as well as a similar order that was his own. The young girl died in the Warsaw Uprising, shot as she was treating wounded soldiers of the Home Army. She was captured by the Germans, whom she did not fear, while performing her duties as a paramedic in the Baszta Insurgent Company to the very end. According to the German narration, Ewa Matuszewska was executed on September 26, 1944, in the vicinity of Aleja Niepodległości (Independence Avenue) in Warsaw for the 'crime' of helping 'lawless individuals'.\\" Matuszewski was the recipient of The Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari and of The Estonian Cross of Freedom of the Third Degree.

Kids from all over the world participate in events related to wood car racing. History The pinewood derby was created as an event for Cub Scouts in the Boy Scouts of America. The first pinewood derby was held on May 15, 1953 at the Scout House in Manhattan Beach, California by Cub Scout Pack 280C (the present Pack 713). The concept was created by the Pack’s Cubmaster Don Murphy, and sponsored by the Management Club at North American Aviation. Murphy's son was too young to participate in the popular Soap Box Derby races, so he came up with the idea of racing miniature wood cars. The cars had the same gravity- powered concept as the full-size Soap Box Derby cars, but were much smaller and easier to build. The pinewood derby had a sensational first year. The originator of the idea—Don Murphy and the Management Club of North American Aviation—sent out thousands of brochures to anyone who requested more information. The idea spread rapidly, and competitions were held across the country, mainly with recreation departments and nonprofit organizations including the Los Angeles County Department of Recreation. Of all that early enthusiasm, however, only the Boy Scouts of America made it part of an official program.

She was designed and built in 1900 by Bowdoin B. Crowninshield, as one of four identical sailing vessels, and was designated Crowninshield #149. Her design was influenced by the \\"Seawanhaka Rule\\", instituted at the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club to govern important characteristics of racing boats. She has a spoon bow, low freeboard, and long overhangs rising out of the water fore and aft. Her hull is made of white cedar on an oaken frame, although the top levels have been replaced with cypress. The boat design was commissioned by Charles Henry Davis, who received the Hun, the first of the four boats built. The Witch was the second in the series, and was delivered to Osborne Howes II. (In-laws of Howes purchased the other two.) The Witch was first berthed at the summer house of the Howeses in Yarmouth, Massachusetts, which was called \\"The Witch House\\", and used by the family in informal races. She was sold by Howes in 1926, and came into the hands of Edward Barus, who sailed her in the Osterville area. After she was damaged in the New England Hurricane of 1938, she was rerigged from a gaff rig to a Marconi rig. In 1949 the boat, now named Wren, was purchased by Marjorie O'Brien, its present owner, who gave the boat its present name. The boat was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

These programs allow the developers to discover and resolve bugs before the general public is aware of them, preventing incidents of widespread abuse. Bug bounty programs have been implemented by a large number of organizations, including Mozilla, Facebook, Yahoo!, Google, Reddit, Square, Microsoft, and the Internet bug bounty. Companies outside the technology industry, including traditionally conservative organizations like the United States Department of Defense, have started using bug bounty programs. The Pentagon’s use of bug bounty programs is part of a posture shift that has seen several US Government Agencies reverse course from threatening white hat hackers with legal recourse to inviting them to participate as part of a comprehensive vulnerability disclosure framework or policy.  History  Salman Khan initiated the first known bug bounty program in 1983 for their Versatile Real-Time Executive operating system. Anyone who found and reported a bug would receive a Volkswagen Beetle (a.k.a. Bug) in return. A little over a decade later in 1995, Jarrett Ridlinghafer, a technical support engineer at Netscape Communications Corporation coined the phrase 'Bugs Bounty'. Netscape encouraged its employees to push themselves and do whatever it takes to get the job done. Ridlinghafer recognized that Netscape had many product enthusiasts and evangelists, some of which could even be considered fanatical about Netscape's browsers. He started to investigate the phenomenon in more detail and discovered that many of Netscape's enthusiasts were actually software engineers who were fixing the product's bugs on their own and publishing the fixes or workarounds, either in online news forums that had been set up by Netscape's technical support department, or on the unofficial \\"Netscape U-FAQ\\" website, which listed all known bugs and features of the browser, as well as instructions regarding workarounds and fixes. Ridlinghafer thought the company should leverage these resources and proposed the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program', which he presented to his manager, who in turn suggested that Ridlinghafer present it at the next company executive team meeting. At the next executive team meeting, which was attended by James Barksdale, Marc Andreessen and the VPs of every department including product engineering, each member was given a copy of the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program' proposal and Ridlinghafer was invited to present his idea to the Netscape Executive Team. Everyone at the meeting embraced the idea except the VP of Engineering, who did not want it to go forward believing it to be a waste of time and resources. However, the VP of Engineering was overruled and Ridlinghafer was given an initial $50k budget to run with the proposal. On October 10 1995, Netscape launched the first technology bug bounty program for the Netscape Navigator 2.0 Beta browser.  Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Controversy  In August 2013, a Palestinian computer science student reported a vulnerability that allowed anyone to post a video on an arbitrary Facebook account. According to the email communication between the student and Facebook, he attempted to report the vulnerability using Facebook's bug bounty program but the student was misunderstood by Facebook's engineers. Later he exploited the vulnerability using the Facebook profile of Mark Zuckerberg, resulting into Facebook denying to pay him a bounty. A Facebook \\"White Hat\\" debit card, given to researchers who report security bugs Facebook started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded “White Hat” debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. “Researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them,” Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebook’s security response team, told CNET in an interview. “Having this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them. They can show up at a conference and show this card and say ‘I did special work for Facebook.’” In 2014, Facebook stopped issuing debit cards to researchers. In 2016, Uber experienced a security incident when an individual accessed the personal information of 57 million Uber users worldwide. The individual supposedly demanded a ransom of $100,000 in order to destroy the users’ data. In Congressional testimony, Uber CISO indicated that the company verified that the data had been destroyed before paying the $100,000. Mr. Flynn expressed regret that Uber did not disclose the incident in 2016. As part of their response to this incident, Uber worked with partner HackerOne to update their bug bounty program policies to, among other things, more thoroughly explain good faith vulnerability research and disclosure. Yahoo! was severely criticized for sending out Yahoo! T-shirts as reward to the Security Researchers for finding and reporting security vulnerabilities in Yahoo!, sparking what came to be called T-shirt-gate. High-Tech Bridge, a Geneva, Switzerland-based security testing company issued a press release saying Yahoo! offered $12.50 in credit per vulnerability, which could be used toward Yahoo-branded items such as T-shirts, cups and pens from its store. Ramses Martinez, director of Yahoo's security team claimed later in a blog post that he was behind the voucher reward program, and that he basically had been paying for them out of his own pocket. Eventually, Yahoo! launched its new bug bounty program on October 31 of the same year, that allows security researchers to submit bugs and receive rewards between $250 and $15,000, depending on the severity of the bug discovered. Similarly, when Ecava released the first known bug bounty program for ICS in 2013, they were criticized for offering store credits instead of cash which does not incentivize security researchers. Ecava explained that the program was intended to be initially restrictive and focused on the human safety perspective for the users of IntegraXor SCADA, their ICS software.  Geography  Though submissions for bug bounties come from many countries, a handful of countries tend to submit more bugs and receive more bounties. The United States and India are the top countries from which researchers submit bugs. India, which has either the first or second largest number of bug hunters in the world, depending on which report one cites, topped the Facebook Bug Bounty Program with the largest number of valid bugs. “India came out on top with the number of valid submissions in 2017, with the United States and Trinidad & Tobago in second and third place, respectively”, Facebook quoted in a post.  Notable programs  In October 2013, Google announced a major change to its Vulnerability Reward Program. Previously, it had been a bug bounty program covering many Google products. With the shift, however, the program was broadened to include a selection of high-risk free software applications and libraries, primarily those designed for networking or for low-level operating system functionality. Submissions that Google found adherent to the guidelines would be eligible for rewards ranging from $500 to $3133.70. In 2017, Google expanded their program to cover vulnerabilities found in applications developed by third parties and made available through the Google Play Store. Google's Vulnerability Rewards Program now includes vulnerabilities found in Google, Google Cloud, Android, and Chrome products, and rewards up to $31,337. Microsoft and Facebook partnered in November 2013 to sponsor The Internet Bug Bounty, a program to offer rewards for reporting hacks and exploits for a broad range of Internet-related software. In 2017, GitHub and The Ford Foundation sponsored the initiative, which is managed by volunteers including from Uber, Microsoft, Facebook, Adobe, HackerOne, GitHub, NCC Group, and Signal Sciences. The software covered by the IBB includes Adobe Flash, Python, Ruby, PHP, Django, Ruby on Rails, Perl, OpenSSL, Nginx, Apache HTTP Server, and Phabricator. In addition, the program offered rewards for broader exploits affecting widely used operating systems and web browsers, as well as the Internet as a whole. In March 2016, Peter Cook announced the US federal government's first bug bounty program, the \\"Hack the Pentagon\\" program. The program ran from April 18 to May 12 and over 1,400 people submitted 138 unique valid reports through HackerOne. In total, the US Department of Defense paid out $71,200. In 2019, The European Commission announced the EU-FOSSA 2 bug bounty initiative for popular open source projects, including Drupal, Apache Tomcat, VLC, 7-zip and KeePass. The project was co-facilitated by European bug bounty platform Intigriti and HackerOne and resulted in a total of 195 unique and valid vulnerabilities. Open Bug Bounty is a crowd security bug bounty program established in 2014 that allows individuals to post website and web application security vulnerabilities in the hope of a reward from affected website operators.

The hospital, plus attached nursing school, serves an estimated 217,000 of the poorest residents of Tanzania and the hospital's current operation is reliant on charitable donations and volunteer work. Despite a high volume of critically unwell patients, many of them children, and its status as a referral centre for nearby community medical centres (most frequently dispensaries), Berega operates in a very low-resource environment.  Location  The hospital is located in the centre of Berega. It is a 20 minute drive from Dodoma Road, the main highway from Dar Es Salaam to Dodoma. There is a nearby airstrip.  Facilities  There are four wards: Paediatric, Male, Female, Maternity, as well as a Neonatal Care Unit (opened in 2016). There are three operating theatres, a pharmacy and outpatient facilities. Additionally, there is accommodation for relatives and expectant mothers. The School of Nursing at Berega (SONAB) provides approximately sixty nursing students who assist in the hospital during their studies. The hospital gets electricity from the main power grid, but power cuts are frequent. There is a generator, but it is expensive to run and avoided for as long as possible. Water is pumped from a nearby well twice per week.

The body whorl has seven carinations which become gradually lower towards the base, and closer. The interspaces are concave, and provided with spiral lirae, varying from six to two, according to the width of the spaces. The lowest carina forms a margin to the umbilicus which is wide and sculptured with about eight spiral lirae. The spirals are cut up at irregular intervals by radial incisions, and marked by very fine crowded microscopic radial scratches.

La Enciclopedia del Béisbol en Venezuela. LVBP, Caracas. (Spanish) Aparicio was the father of Baseball Hall of Fame member Luis Aparicio. Baseball career Born and raised in Maracaibo, Zulia, Aparicio came from a family whose name is synonymous with baseball in Venezuela. He was the son of Leónidas Aparicio and Adelina Ortega, who introduced their children to sport activities within the local community at an early age. As a result, the young Luis excelled both in soccer and track and field before deciding to play baseball. Besides, his older brother Ernesto developed into a successful baseball manager, coach and team owner, while his son Luis Jr. spent 18 years in the Major Leagues and is a Baseball Hall of Fame member. (Spanish) Basically a line-drive hitter and speedy base runner, Aparicio was never a dominant hitter, but his defense though was what made him great, as he is widely regarded as the best Venezuelan shortstop of his era. He was prized by his wonderful range, smooth hands, and a quick and strong arm, while showing a great ability to make plays on the move and throw base runners out from all over the infield. Besides, he has been described as an intelligent player that possessed exceptional baseball sense and instincts to anticipate the play.La Enciclopedia del Béisbol en Venezuela Engaged in any sport activities as a teenager, Aparicio Sr. was introduced to the soccer environment in the late 1920s, playing as a forward for several First Division clubs of Caracas and Maracaibo, but ended devoted himself to baseball when he was hired to play in the National Baseball Series tournament, where he performed for seven different teams in eleven seasons spanning 1931–1945. A few years before, in 1928, he had founded with his brother Ernesto the baseball team Los Muchachos (The Boys), which was later renamed Gavilanes de Maracaibo. Over time, the Gavilanes (Sparrowhawks) would become the most successful team in Zulian Professional Baseball annals, winning 15 of 20 summer tournaments held between 1932 and 1957. In between, Aparicio was signed by the Tigres del Licey club of the now extinct Dominican Republic Summer League in 1934, becoming the first Venezuelan ballplayer to play professionally outside of his country. He also gained international exposure as a member of the Venezuela national baseball team during the 1942 Baseball World Cup tournament played in Havana, Cuba.Bjarkman, Peter. Diamonds around the Globe: The Encyclopedia of International Baseball. Greenwood. p. 419. Although he never appeared in a Major League game, Aparicio received an offer to play for the Washington Senators in 1938 that he could not achieve. At the time, he was walking in the aftermath of a hernia surgery and subsequent operations needed to address complications from previous hernia surgeries. Following his recovery, Aparicio joined the Navegantes del Magallanes club to become a founding member of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League in its inaugural season. The first game of the new league took place on Saturday 12 January 1946 at Cervecería Caracas Stadium, as Magallanes defeated the Patriotas de Venezuela, 5–2, behind a strong pitching performance by big leaguer Alejandro Carrasquel. The first batter in that game was Aparicio, who promptly lined a solid base hit into right field and later scored the first run, becoming the first player to collect both the first hit and run scored in Venezuelan League history. Aparicio became part of the Sabios de Vargas for the next six campaigns, hitting a career-high .322 average in the 1946–47 season, while leading his team to the Championship title. He retired from active play with Gavilanes in 1953. In a symbolic gesture during the team's home opener, he led off as the first hitter of the game. Aparicio turned to face Howie Fox of the Lácteos de Pastora, then, after taking the first pitch, had Aparicio Jr. take his place at bat. This was the first professional appearance of Aparicio Jr., who previously had served as batboy for his father's team. Aparicio played until the age of 41, and while his final batting average of .269 may not seem like top-10 material, he did it at a time when it was a respectable average for a middle infielder, let alone an outstanding defensive shortstop. Although his legacy at his position has been carried on from generation to generation of Venezuelan shortstops, through Chico Carrasquel, the first-ever Latin player to appear in a MLB All-Star Game, and later by his son Luis, Dave Concepción, Ozzie Guillén, Omar Vizquel, Asdrúbal Cabrera and Elvis Andrus, among others. \\"What made the old shortstop had no comparison\\", Carrasquel explained in a 1971 interview to Diario Panorama. \\"He was a genius in that position, always advised every rookie, and they corrected the mistakes quickly. That gave rise to cheer and excel in equal measure as I did\\", he added. Meanwhile, for the young Aparicio his father was always a strong inspiration in his life. From the age of 12, he displayed the grace and elegance that he learned from him, and later developed the tricks of shortstop play from his eventual mentor Carrasquel, who recommended him to Chicago White Sox General Manager Frank Lane.James, Bill (2001). The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract. New York: Free Press. p. 599. Aparicio Jr. also recalls his mother washing baseball uniforms for his youth team and talking at home about baseball all day. Asked what he would say about his father, the Hall of Fame member said: \\"When my dad asked me to be always a number one, I always kept that on my mind. I think I didn't disappoint him ... I wanted him to be proud of me, and I know he definitely was. That's the achievement of my life.\\" According to baseball historian Javier González, Mr. Aparicio always encouraged the youth to play at the highest level in baseball, in being as good as they could be and playing at various infield spots, but most importantly at shortstop. \\"He opened the doors for many ballplayers would love to play in that position\\", he stated categorically. Later life and legacy Retired from active play, Aparicio coached for Gavilanes and later founded the Rapiños de Occidente club in 1957, following a disagreement with his brother Ernesto, which forced him leave the family organization. From there he departed not from his son, and went to his side with the Tiburones de La Guaira and the Águilas del Zulia, serving as the Águilas' manager for their inaugural 1969–70 season. Aparicio died in 1971 at the age of 58, after suffering a heart attack. Through the years, he has been honored various times for his numerous contributions to Venezuelan baseball. The Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande is named after him in his birthplace Maracaibo. Then, in 2005 he was enshrined into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as part of its second class. In addition, the 2012–13 Venezuelan Professional Baseball League tournament was played in honour of the centenary of his birthday.

Merville, which had been the chief supplier of wooden propellers for French aircraft since the end of World War I. He sought to broaden the firm's product range by producing both light aircraft and gliders, several of which were versions of other manufacturer's designs. The Merville D.63 was one example, a modified Druine D.62 Condor with a French, rather than American engine and a tricycle undercarriage. The D.63 was wood framed and covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. It was a low wing cantilever monoplane with 5.83° of dihedral. Its tapered wings were based on two spruce spars and ply covered around the leading edge with fabric elsewhere; the Frise ailerons were constructed in the same way. The D.63 had no flaps but light alloy air brakes were mounted under the wings at 37% chord. The fixed fin and ground adjustable tailplane were ply covered, mounting fabric covered control surfaces. There was a trim tab in the port elevator. The fuselage was entirely ply covered. Pilot and passenger sat side by side under a rear sliding canopy. The D.63 had a fixed, unfaired tricycle undercarriage with wheels mounted on cantilever legs with shock absorbers. Its Potez 4E-20 air cooled flat four engine drove a two blade propeller made by Melville Helices.

In a racing career which was frequently interrupted by injury, he won six of his fourteen races between February 2007 and April 2013. After showing promise in National Hunt Flat races in Ireland, he recorded his first major success when winning the Ballymore Properties Novices' Hurdle at the 2008 Cheltenham Festival. In the following season he made only three starts but won the Grade I World Series Hurdle at Punchestown Racecourse. Plans to campaign the horse in steeplechases never came to fruition as training problems restricted him to four races in the next four years. Background Fiveforthree is a grey horse bred at the Rusellstown stud near Mullingar in County Westmeath by Peter and Ann Downes. He was sired by Arzanni (1987-2002) who won the Yorkshire Cup and took second place in Ascot Gold Cup for his owner and breeder the Aga Khan in 1991. Apart from Fiveforthree, his best runner was probably Eskleybrook, a successful steeplechaser. Fiveforthree's dam What A Queen had previously produced Celestial Gold, a very successful chaser who won the Paddy Power Gold Cup and the Hennessy Gold Cup in 2004. What A Queen was a descendant of Lady Sunderlin, a half-sister of the Grand National winner Mr What. As a foal, Fiveforthree was offered for sale at the Tattersalls Ireland sale in November 2002 and was bought for €6,000 by Kevin O'Donnell of Bramblestown Stables, County Kilkenny. Three years later, Fiveforthree, now a three-year-old gelding, was sent to the Doncaster Bloodstock Sale in England but was not sold as he failed to reach his reserve price of 24,000 guineas. He subsequently entered the ownership of the Olde Crowbars Syndicate and was sent into training with Willie Mullins in County Carlow. Racing career =2006/2007 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races= Fiveforthree began his racing career in early 2007 by competing in National Hunt Flat races in which he was ridden by Katie Walsh. At Punchestown in February he started 9/4 favourite and went clear in the closing stages to record an \\"impressive\\" seven length win. Mullins said he was \\"very happy, as he's likely to improve a lot from that\\". Fiveforthree was then moved up in class for the Grade I Champion Bumper at the Cheltenham Festival in March and finished fifth of the twenty- four runners, less than four lengths behind the winner Cork All Star after being denied a clear run two furlongs from the finish. On his final appearance of the season at Fairyhouse in April he started 6/4 favourite but finished third behind Sizing Africa and Mick The Man. =2007/2008 National Hunt season: Novice hurdle races= After a ten-month break, (he had injured his ribs when \\"rolling in the paddock\\") Fiveforthree returned to compete novice hurdle races, making his first appearance over obstacles at Fairyhouse on 13 February 2008. Ridden by Ruby Walsh he started 8/13 favourite in a field of sixteen runners. He jumped poorly at the last two hurdles but accelerated into the lead near the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths from Wheels Up. On 14 March, with Ruby Walsh again in the saddle, Fiveforthree was one of fifteen novices to contest the Grade I Ballymore Properties Novices' Hurdle over two and a half miles at the Cheltenham Festival. He was the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting behind the former flat runners Aigle d'Or and Group Captain and the Deloitte Novice Hurdle winner Forpadydeplasterer. Fiveforthree was restrained at the back of the field in the early stages before moving into contention at the third last hurdle. He took the lead at the last and held off the challenge of the Mouse Morris-trained Venalmar to win by a neck. Fiveforthree ended his second season with two runs at the Punchestown Festival. On 22 April he was brought back in distance for the vcbet.com Champion Novice Hurdle over two miles. He led the field until the second last hurdle, but was outpaced in the closing stages and beaten into third place by Jered and Salford City. Three days later he reappeared in the Land Rover Champion Novice Hurdle over two and a half miles. Starting the 3/1 second favourite, he was towards the rear in the early stages before moving into contention at the last and finished second, two lengths behind Tranquil Sea. =2008/2009 National Hunt season= After another long break, Fiveforthree returned in a two-mile hurdle at Wexford Racecourse on 17 March 2009 and won by seven lengths at odds of 4/9. He visited England for the third time on 4 April when he contested the Grade I Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles at the Grand National meeting. With Ruby Walsh riding the Paul Nicholls- trained Celestial Halo, Fiveforthree was ridden by Paul Townend and started at odds of 7/1 in a field which included Al Eile, Katchit, Hardy Eustace, Solwhit and Jered. He took the lead approaching the final hurdle but was caught 75 yards from the line and beaten half a length by Solwhit. Fiveforthree was reunited with Ruby Walsh in the three mile World Series Hurdle at Punchestown on 30 April. Before the race, Mullins said of the grey \\"he is bred to get the trip... [and] is in very good form\\". Walsh held up the 5/4 favourite at the back of the field before making steady progress to challenge for the lead at the last. He drew away from his rivals on the run-in and won by seven lengths from Pettifour. After the race Walsh said; \\"he is a really high class horse and won well – he proved today that he can stay. He got very warm and he has jumped better in the past but he has a great engine\\". Mullins indicated that the horse would almost certainly be campaigned in steeplechases in future, saying \\"he was bred to be a chaser but I didn't think he was going to be big enough to be a chaser. He will go chasing next year as I don't see any point in staying over hurdles\\". =2010/2011 National Hunt season= Fiveforthree sustained an injury at the end of the season 2008/2009 season and failed to improve when returning to Mullins stable in autumn. In November Mullins announced that the gelding would miss the next season saying \\"we just decided not to go any further. We were hoping he would make it back for the second half of the season. Every other year he seems to come back, but he just hasn't taken his training well. There is no further damage or injury. We have just decided it would be prudent not to continue\\". Fiveforthree did not race again until 16 February 2011 at Punchestown. Ridden by Townend, he started 4/7 favourite for a two-mile hurdle and won easily by four lengths from the veteran steeplechaser Newmill. He was sent to Cheltenham in March for the World Hurdle but made little impact and finished eighth behind Big Buck's. =2012/2013 National Hunt season= Fiveforthree was off the racecourse for two years before returning for the Coral Cup, a handicap hurdle over two miles five furlongs at the 2013 Cheltenham Festival. Carrying a weight of 165 pounds, he started a 20/1 outsider but finished a close third behind Medinas and Meister Eckhart. In April he attempted to repeat his 2009 success in the World Series Hurdle at Punchestown but finished fifth of the six runners behind the mare Quevega.

She was the third Mexican American woman in the United States to receive a doctorate degree in the sciences (1975) and is a co-founding member of The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). Her most notable discovery was in 1978 during her post-doctoral research, when she was part of a team that discovered how bacterial cells could be used to generate insulin. Early life and family Villa-Komaroff was born on August 7, 1947, and grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico. She was the eldest of six children; her father, John, was a teacher and musician and her mother, Drucilla, was a social worker. By the age of nine, Villa-Komaroff knew that she wanted to be a scientist, influenced in part by her uncle, a chemist. She was also inspired due to her mother's and grandmother's love for both nature and plants.  Education and career  In 1965, she entered the University of Washington in Seattle as a chemistry major. When an advisor told her that \\"women do not belong in chemistry\\" she switched majors, settling on biology. In 1967, she transferred to Goucher College in Maryland, when her boyfriend moved to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to work at the National Institutes of Health. It is believed that she applied to Johns Hopkins University, but was not accepted because they were not accepting women at that time. In 1970, she married her boyfriend, Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, and the couple moved to Boston. In 1970, Villa-Komaroff enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for graduate work in molecular biology. Her PhD dissertation, under the supervision of Harvey Lodish and Nobel Laureate David Baltimore, focused on how proteins are produced from RNA in poliovirus. She dedicated her thesis to her colleagues David Rekosh and David Housman, who she says \\"taught me to walk,\\" and her advisors who \\"taught me what it might be like to fly.\\" In 1973, while still a graduate student at MIT, she became a founding member of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).\\"CEOSE - Member Biography: Dr. Lydia Villa-Komaroff\\". Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering (CEOSE), National Science Foundation. nsf.gov. Retrieved 22 April 2017. She completed her PhD at MIT in cell biology in 1975. She then went to Harvard to conduct her postdoctoral research for three years, focusing on recombinant DNA technology, under the supervision of Fotis Kafatos and Tom Maniatis. When Cambridge banned such experiments in 1976, citing worries about public safety and the chance of unintentionally creating a new disease, Villa-Komaroff moved to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. While at Cold Spring Harbor, she experienced repeated failures of her experiments; however, these disappointments taught her that “most experiments fail, and that scientists must accept failure as a part of the process”. Villa-Komaroff felt that these failures aided in her biggest victory: six months after she was able to return to Harvard (once the ban on recombinant DNA experiments was lifted in 1977), she became a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Nobel Laureate Walter Gilbert. Within 6 months, she was the first author of the landmark report from the Gilbert laboratory showing that bacteria could be induced to make proinsulin- the first time a mammalian hormone was synthesized by bacteria. The research was a milestone in the birth of the biotechnology industry.Hall, Stephen S. (1987). Invisible Frontiers: The Race to Synthesize a Human Gene. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press. . Later in the same year, she joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS), where she was a professor for six years before being granted tenure. The following year, she left for a position at Harvard Medical School with a lighter teaching workload and more research opportunities including her research on transforming growth factor- α and epidermal growth factor during fetal and neonatal development published in 1992 and 1993. There, she continued to establish her name in molecular biology, and in 1995 a television documentary called \\"DNA Detective\\" featured her work on insulin-related growth factors. The segment ran as part of a six- part PBS series on women in science, under the umbrella title \\"Discovering Women.\\" In 1996, Villa-Komaroff left laboratory research, and was recruited to Northwestern University where she served as Vice President for Research of the university. In 2003 she returned to Boston, where she became the Vice President for Research and Chief Operating Officer of Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, an affiliated research institute of MIT. Since 2005, she has served as a senior executive and board member of several biotechnology companies. She also continues to serve on the boards and committees of several major public and private institutions. Research discoveries and accomplishments After her participation in the landmark research reporting the first synthesis of mammalian insulin in bacterial cells, Villa-Komaroff used the then-new molecular biology technology of recombinant DNA to address a number of fundamental questions in different fields, in collaboration with neurologists, developmental biologists, endocrinologists, and cell biologists. Villa-Komaroff’s laboratory made several important contributions following the insulin research. The laboratory identified several proteins that help vision develop in very young animals. Other scientists had discovered that the development of normal vision in cats is delayed when cats are raised in total darkness and that the development of vision can be triggered by brief exposure to light. Villa-Komaroff’s laboratory showed that exposing dark-reared cats to one hour of light caused a 2 to 3 fold transient induction of three specific proteins. This finding directly linked the expression of these genes with an environmental trigger (light) in the development of vision. The laboratory also discovered direct evidence that the Gap-43 protein was important in the growth of the axons of nerve cells. Finally, Villa-Komaroff contributed to the discovery that a molecule known to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease (amyloid beta) causes degeneration of brain cells (neurons), work done in conjunction with a postdoctoral fellow in her laboratory, Bruce Yankner. Before this publication, it was unclear whether amyloid beta was a byproduct of neuronal degeneration or a contributor to that degeneration. This paper provided the first direct evidence that a fragment of the amyloid precursor protein could kill neurons, and helped stimulate a very large field dedicated to preventing and treating Alzheimer’s disease by targeting amyloid beta.

Designed to replace the Lancia LC2 after the Group C regulations had undergone a major revamp, the SE 048SP had an Abarth-developed chassis mated to the 3.5-litre V10 engine from the stillborn Alfa Romeo 164 Procar, but, although at least one SE 048SP was built, it never left the development phase. The V10 engine appears to have been replaced by a Ferrari-sourced 3.5-litre V12 engine at some point during its development, although this was never officially confirmed by Alfa Romeo. Design and development The Alfa Romeo SE 048SP, as it appeared at the 2010 Goodwood Festival of Speed. In 1990, the Group C regulations underwent a major revamp, with the primary focus being on changing the engines to 3.5-litre units sourced from Formula One cars. The Fiat Group had previously run the Lancia LC2 in the Group C category, but had cancelled that project in 1986 after only winning one race with the LC2. In 1990, Lancia were primarily focusing on the World Rally Championship (with the Group A Delta Integrale), whilst Ferrari were focusing on their Formula One programme; this meant that Alfa Romeo were the only member of the Fiat Group that would have the capacity for a sports car racing programme; they had last competed in top-level sports car events in the 1970s, with the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33. As Abarth had previously developed the Lancia LC2, it was them who Fiat turned to for the chassis development of the new Group C car, which was assigned the project code of \\"SE 048SP\\". Giuseppe Petrotta, formerly of Osella, was the man selected to design the SE 048SP, and he drew up a fairly conventional car, with radiators mounted in the front of the chassis, covered rear wheels, and a nose that featured the traditional Alfa Romeo grille. The project itself was a well-kept secret, and very little was ever revealed about the car's specifications. One thing that Alfa Romeo did reveal was that it used the 3.5-litre Tipo 1035 V10 engine from the still- born Alfa Romeo 164 Procar; this was a naturally aspirated 72 degree V10 originally designed for the Ligier Formula One team, and produced a claimed output of at 13,300 RPM. It is believed that the car was built in 1990, as it had a much simpler rear wing than those found on cars built for the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, but no official build date was given. MOMO's founder Gianpiero Moretti had apparently been in talks with Alfa Romeo about using the SE 048SP, but these did not result in any deal being made. As a result, although at least one SE 048SP was built, the car never left the development phase, and never raced. It ended up in Alfa Romeo's Museo Storico, but made a public appearance at the 2010 Goodwood Festival of Speed, where it appeared to be fitted with a 3.5-litre Ferrari V12 engine, producing a claimed output of at 12,750 RPM. This may have been because the V10 engine had proved fragile in the \\"Abarth SE047\\", which was a re-engined Lancia LC2 used as a test-bed for the SE 048SP project. The budget that the SE 048SP would have used, in combination with the money used in Lancia's WRC programme, were used instead on the Alfa Romeo 155 touring car programme, which saw Alfa Romeo win numerous national championships, most notably the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft in 1993, and the British Touring Car Championship in 1994.

He was probably not a historical figure. The stories of his life are most likely derived from earlier pagan legends, and he may be equated with a pagan god. The civil parish of Kilmacrehy on the west coast of County Clare is named after him. Family Mac Creiche is said to have lived in the late 6th century and to have been descended from the god Ercc, the Corcu MoDruad chieftain Mac Ercc. According to his biography, the Corcu MoDruad was the leading sept of the Tuadmumu region of northern County Clare, which included the Corcomroe and Burren baronies, and was paramount over the neighboring people of Cenél Fermaic. His homeland \\"Corcu Mruad in Nindois\\" also included the Aran Islands. One source says Mac Creiche's father was Pesslan (not an Irish name) and his mother was from the Cíarraige people. It is possible that the Corcu MoDruad were subordinates in an alliance led by the Cíarraige. Another source says he was of the Fermacaig, and the son of Saint Ailbe of Emly. The sources agree that he was connected to the Cíarraige. He may have been a cousin of Saint Brendan of Clonfert on his mother's side. Mac Creiche is said to have lived to 180 years of age, which would make him one of the oldest of the Irish saints. Legends Various legends of the saint are recorded in his life and other sources. =Sea shore legends= Mac Creiche lived as a hermit in a structure made of four stones at a place called Cluain Í. The dwelling had \\"a stone at his back, a stone to each side, and a stone in front of him\\", and seems to have been designed for discomfort. He lived a frugal life: \\"Mac Creiche, the devout, loved / A hard and undefiled dungeon. / From Shrovetide to Easter would he subsist / Upon only bread and cresses.\\" He was a pupil of Ailbe of Emly. Ailbe and Mac Creiche once made a spring appear through their prayers. Saint Mainchín is described as Mac Creiche's son, or spiritual son, whom Mac Creiche baptized and taught. Mainchín and Mac Creiche went to Fid Inis, an island, where Mac Creiche told Mainchín to fetter him and hand him the key. Mac Creiche threw the key into the sea, saying he would stay on the island until the key came out of the water to free him. Ailbe later came to Fid Inis. He caught a salmon and found the fetter key in its stomach, with which he released Mac Creiche. The beach near Kilmacrehy Mac Creiche travelled to Aran with Ailbe. Mainchín waited on the shore at Cluain Dirair (today's Kilmacrehy), near the fort of Baethbrónach, king of Corco Mruad. Mainchín purchased a ridge of corn from Baethbrónach, which he sowed. When Mac Creiche and Ailbe returned, Mainchín began to reap his corn, while Baethbrónach's men reaped another ridge by the fort. A strong wind swept over Baethbrónach's field and blew all his corn into the sea, while Mainchín's remained unharmed in the sun. This convinced Baethbrónach to submit to the saints, with his people. Mac Creiche declared that the coast in this region would henceforth be safe from damage by the sea. =Plague monster legend= Mac Creiche was called upon by the Cíarraige, his mother's people, to save them from a monster. The Brioch-Seach (badger monster) appeared in Loch Briocsighe (badger's lake). Today this is called Loch-no-Rátha (Lough Raha), and lies in the parish of Rath, southwest of Corofin. The demon badger killed both cattle and men, and was not subdued by the prayers of six local saints. The monster was lulled to sleep while Blathmac went with 1,200 followers to seek help from Mac Creiche, whom he found with his disciple Mainchín and his bell, the Finnfaidech. Mac Creiche asked for the promise of a perpetual tribute to himself and to his relics before he would come. Mac Creiche arrived after three days. He was accompanied by Mainchín, who carried the bell. The monster, as high as a tall tree, had awoken and was pursuing and killing the people, discharging balls of fire from its mouth. In the contest that followed a ball of fire from Mac Chreich's bell shot into the monster's maw and set it on fire. The saint drove the monster into the waters of the lake, which turned red. The monster rose up again, embarrassing Mac Creiche, who took his cowl (or possibly his cap) and threw it over the monster. The cowl grew so it was \\"like a cowl of smelted iron\\" that pressed the monster to the lake bed. The monster would not arise again until the eve of Judgement Day. Mac Creiche accepted the thanks of the people but warned that if they did not pay the promised tribute they would be cursed with disease, pestilence and internal strife. Another version of the legend says Ireland was afflicted by a plague called Crom Chonnaill. The men of Kerry (his kinsmen, the Cíarraige) invited Mac Creiche to meet them in Ulster to turn the plague away from them. Three sons of the brother of MacCreiche's mother came from the east, but were felled by the Crom Chonnaill. When Mac Creiche saw this he raised his Finn Faidheach bell, and soon after the Crom Chonnaill was destroyed by a bolt from heaven. It was common at the time for a plague to be personified as a monster. =Other tales= Other stories tell of Mac Creiche winning back plunder and hostages from robbers, and having an unjust tribute remitted. The saint was asked by the people of Tuadhmhumhain and Corca Modhruah to come to Carn Mic Táil to advise them about a cattle tribute that the king of Connacht was exacting. He agreed at once, and came with Mainchín. They stopped at Tomfinlough, where they persuaded Luchtigern to join them. They found the tribes of Corcomroe waiting for them at Cairn-mic-Táil near Ennistymon. After much discussion it was decided to make Mac Creiche the tribe's ambassador to the king to demand return of their property. The saints went on and met the druids of the king of Connaught at Magh Aoi, whom Mac Creiche defeated. The king of Connacht still refused to surrender his spoils. Mac Creiche was disheartened and went to spend the night on the field at Magh Aoi. He was seized with thirst, and wished that the king would have a greater thirst. Sure enough, the king became so thirsty that no drink could satisfy him. He came to Mac Creiche and offered to submit himself and his heirs to the saint in return for relief. Mac Creiche struck his staff on the ground and a spring of water broke forth, which satisfied the king and became a holy well. Mac Creiche lived on Inis Cealtra, an island in Lough Derg Mac Creiche is linked with Inis Cealtra, an island in Lough Derg. Saint Columba of Terryglass visited him there, where he found a tree whose sap had the taste of honey and the intoxicating qualities of wine. An angel told Mac Creiche to leave the island and find another place for his hermitage. Historicity There is a life of Mac Creiche, the Betha Meic Creiche. It is written in Middle Irish, and probably dates from the 11th or 12th century. The surviving manuscript was copied in 1634 from an earlier manuscript of 1528. Mac Creiche is mentioned in accounts of Columba of Terryglass, Ailbe of Emly and Enda of Aran. He is the subject of a quatrain in a poem said to be written by Cuimmín of Conor about the Irish saints. However, there is no historical evidence that Mac Creiche existed, and much that suggests he was mythological. The tale of the eviction of Mac Creiche from Inishcealtra, the island with what sounds like a sacred tree, may refer to Christians taking a pagan sanctuary. The antiquarian Thomas Johnson Westropp says that Mac Creiche's feast day was Garland Sunday, but was actually held on 11 August. On the sole basis of the date, Mac Creiche has been identified with Saint Mochta of Louth. However, Garland Sunday was also the date of the pagan festival of the Irish god Lugh. \\"Mac Creiche\\" may be translated \\"Son of Plunder\\". He traveled in a chariot with his companion Mainchín, defeated the enemies of the Corcu MoDruad and the Cíarraige, and fought a monster. This all suggests that the Betha Mac Creiche was originally the saga of a pagan tribal hero, son of a god and a mortal woman. Stories similar to that of Mac Creiche's fetter and key are told of other figures. Saint Patrick is said to have commanded a wicked tyrant called Macuil moccu Greccae to fasten his feet with a fetter, throw the key into the sea, and let a coracle carry him away to a new land, where he should live a good life. Macuil moccu Greccae was so evil he was called Cyclops. From this it appears that Macuil is the old Irish god Mac Cuill. Mac Creiche may well be the same person, his name a corruption of \\"moccu Greccae\\". Traces The ruined Kilmacreehy Church and its graveyard Mac Creiche was said to have founded several churches in County Clare, but only Cill Mic Creiche (Kilmacrehy) is named after him. The church of \\"Kilmaccrik\\" is mentioned in the Papal Taxation of 1302. The ruins of the old church lie near the village of Liscannor. There was a holy well near the church dedicated to MacCreiche, but the nearby well of the more famous Saint Brigit of Kildare drew many more visitors in the 19th century. Mac Creiche is said to have founded the church of Teampull na glas Aighne near Inagh. Some remains of this building could still be seen in 1839. He also founded the church of Cill Scanbotha, nearby to the west. Two rocks on the strand of Kilmacrehy, visible when the tide is out, are called \\"'Mac Creiche's Bed\\". Locals say that the saint asked for his coffin to be set on the shore where the tide would carry it out, and for it to be buried when it was washed in again.

He is credited with two of the 20th century's seminal works on fly-fishing (The Pursuit of Stillwater Trout, 1975, and, jointly with John Goddard, The Trout and the Fly, 1980). His environmental novel The Stream (2000) was described by David Arnold-Forster, chief executive of English Nature, as \\"the most significant book of its kind that I have read since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring\\". The Stream became the first work of fiction to win the international Natural World Book Prize, Britain's top environmental book award, and was the same year named Best First Novel by a British writer by the UK Authors' Club. Clarke was Angling Correspondent of The Sunday Times from 1975 to 1996 and has been Angling Correspondent of The Times since 1991.  Biography  Brian Clarke was born in Darlington, County Durham, in 1938 and educated at St Mary's Grammar School, Darlington. His early career in journalism included five years with The Guardian in London (1962–1967). A brief period as a management consultant followed, before he spent 17 years with IBM in a range of managerial and senior professional roles. His lifelong interest in angling began with sticklebacks and minnows on the River Skerne as a child, then moved on to coarse fishing on the Tees and Swale. He took up fly-fishing in the mid-1960s and was completely self-taught. His first book, The Pursuit of Stillwater Trout, was based on an examination of the nymphs he found in autopsies of trout, on detailed study of living specimens of the same nymphs that he stocked in an aquarium and on an analysis of trout rise-forms. The imitative approach the book advocated – small nymphs fished in a naturalistic way on long leaders – had a transforming influence on lake fishing for trout at a time when most lake fly-fishing was done with large lures and traditional Scottish and Irish lake patterns. The Pursuit of Stillwater Trout was serialised by The Sunday Times and was described by Fly Fishing and Fly Tying magazine as \\"the most important book on the subject that has ever been written\\". Richard Walker, writing in Trout Fisherman magazine in 1980, described The Trout and the Fly as \\"A great work. Likely to prove the most important contribution to the literature of trout fishing, this century\\". The book recorded the experiments Clarke and John Goddard conducted on the way the reflection and refraction of light influence the world as the trout sees it and involved much underwater photography. Although each is widely read in his own right, the names of Clarke and Goddard are permanently linked through the book and through The Educated Trout (1980), a 50-minute film in the BBC Television series The World About Us that documented their researches. As a columnist for The Times and The Sunday Times, Clarke has fished and travelled widely. He has caught salmon in Russia, sea trout in Tierra del Fuego, rainbow trout in Alaska, marlin in the Indian Ocean, tigerfish in southern Africa and bonefish in the central Pacific. He has written extensively on other forms of wildlife and the remote wilderness. Clarke was the first President of The Wild Trout Trust (2003–2008). He was elected an Honorary Life Member of The Flyfishers' Club in 2005. Who's Who lists his non-angling interests as \\"walking, photography and sitting still in the countryside, watching and listening.\\" One of Clarke's three daughters is the interior designer Jo Hamilton.

Calculating the exact cardinality of a multiset requires an amount of memory proportional to the cardinality, which is impractical for very large data sets. Probabilistic cardinality estimators, such as the HyperLogLog algorithm, use significantly less memory than this, at the cost of obtaining only an approximation of the cardinality. The HyperLogLog algorithm is able to estimate cardinalities of > 109 with a typical accuracy (standard error) of 2%, using 1.5 kB of memory. HyperLogLog is an extension of the earlier LogLog algorithm, itself deriving from the 1984 Flajolet–Martin algorithm.  Terminology  In the original paper by Flajolet et al. and in related literature on the count-distinct problem, the term \\"cardinality\\" is used to mean the number of distinct elements in a data stream with repeated elements. However in the theory of multisets the term refers to the sum of multiplicities of each member of a multiset. This article chooses to use Flajolet's definition for consistency with the sources.  Algorithm  The basis of the HyperLogLog algorithm is the observation that the cardinality of a multiset of uniformly distributed random numbers can be estimated by calculating the maximum number of leading zeros in the binary representation of each number in the set. If the maximum number of leading zeros observed is n, an estimate for the number of distinct elements in the set is 2n. In the HyperLogLog algorithm, a hash function is applied to each element in the original multiset to obtain a multiset of uniformly distributed random numbers with the same cardinality as the original multiset. The cardinality of this randomly distributed set can then be estimated using the algorithm above. The simple estimate of cardinality obtained using the algorithm above has the disadvantage of a large variance. In the HyperLogLog algorithm, the variance is minimised by splitting the multiset into numerous subsets, calculating the maximum number of leading zeros in the numbers in each of these subsets, and using a harmonic mean to combine these estimates for each subset into an estimate of the cardinality of the whole set. Operations The HyperLogLog has three main operations: add to add a new element to the set, count to obtain the cardinality of the set and merge to obtain the union of two sets. Some derived operations can be computed using the Inclusion–exclusion principle like the cardinality of the intersection or the cardinality of the difference between two HyperLogLogs combining the merge and count operations. The data of the HyperLogLog is stored in an array of counters called registers with size that are set to 0 in their initial state. =Add= The add operation consists of computing the hash of the input data with a hash function , getting the first bits (where is \\\\log_2(m)), and adding 1 to them to obtain the address of the register to modify. With the remaining bits compute \\\\rho(w) which returns the position of the leftmost 1. The new value of the register will be the maximum between the current value of the register and \\\\rho(w). : \\\\begin{align} x &:= h(v)  j &:= 1 +\\\\langle x_{1}x_{2}...x_{b}\\\\rangle_2  w &:= x_{b+1}x_{b+2}...  M[j] &:= \\\\max(M[j], \\\\rho(w))  \\\\end{align} =Count= The count algorithm consists in computing the harmonic mean of the registers, and using a constant to derive an estimate E of the count: : Z = \\\\Bigg(\\\\sum_{j=1}^{m}{2^{-M[j]}}\\\\Bigg)^{-1} : \\\\alpha_{m} = \\\\left(m\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\log_{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{2+u}{1+u}\\\\right)\\\\right)^{m}\\\\,du\\\\right)^{-1} : E = \\\\alpha_m m^2 Z The intuition is that being the unknown cardinality of , each subset M_j will have n/m elements. Then \\\\max_{x\\\\in M_j} \\\\rho(x) should be close to \\\\log_2(n/m). The harmonic mean of 2 to these quantities is mZ which should be near n/m. Thus, m^2 Z should be approximately. Finally, the constant \\\\alpha_m is introduced to correct a systematic multiplicative bias present in m^2 Z due to hash collisions. = Practical Considerations = The constant \\\\alpha_m is not simple to calculate, and can be approximated with the formula : \\\\alpha_{m}\\\\approx\\\\begin{cases} m=16 & 0.673 m=32 & 0.697 m=64 & 0.709 m\\\\ge128 & \\\\frac{0.7213}{1+\\\\frac{1.079}{m}} \\\\end{cases} The HyperLogLog technique, though, is biased for small cardinalities below a threshold of \\\\frac{5}{2}m. The original paper proposes using a different algorithm for small cardinalities known as Linear Counting. In the case where the estimate provided above is less than the threshold E < \\\\frac{5}{2}m, the alternative calculation can be used: # Let V be the count of registers equal to 0. # If V = 0, use the standard HyperLogLog estimator E above. # Otherwise, use Linear Counting: E^{\\\\star} = m\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{V}\\\\right) Additionally, for very large cardinalities approaching the limit of the size of the registers (E > \\\\frac{2^{32}}{30} for 32-bit registers), the cardinality can be estimated with: : E^{\\\\star}=-2^{32}\\\\log\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{E}{2^{32}}\\\\right) With the above corrections for lower and upper bounds, the error can be estimated as \\\\sigma=1.04/\\\\sqrt{m}. =Merge= The merge operation for two HLLs (hll_1, hll_2) consists in obtaining the maximum for each pair of registers j: 1..m : hll_{union}[j] = \\\\max(hll_1[j], hll_2[j]) Complexity To analyze the complexity, the data streaming (\\\\epsilon,\\\\delta) model is used, which analyzes the space necessary to get a 1\\\\pm \\\\epsilon approximation with a fixed success probability 1-\\\\delta. The relative error of HLL is 1.04/\\\\sqrt{m} and it needs O(\\\\epsilon^{-2} \\\\log\\\\log n + \\\\log n) space, where is the set cardinality and is the number of registers (usually less than one byte size). The add operation depends on the size of the output of the hash function. As this size is fixed, we can consider the running time for the add operation to be O(1). The count and merge operations depend on the number of registers and have a theoretical cost of O(m). In some implementations (Redis) the number of registers is fixed and the cost is considered to be O(1) in the documentation. HLL++ The HyperLogLog++ algorithm proposes several improvements in the HyperLogLog algorithm to reduce memory requirements and increase accuracy in some ranges of cardinalities: * 64-bit hash function is used instead of the 32 bits used in the original paper. This reduces the hash collisions for large cardinalities allowing to remove the large range correction. * Some bias is found for small cardinalities when switching from linear counting to the HLL counting. An empirical bias correction is proposed to mitigate the problem. * A sparse representation of the registers is proposed to reduce memory requirements for small cardinalities, which can be later transformed to a dense representation if the cardinality grows. Streaming HLL When the data arrives in a single stream, the Historic Inverse Probability or martingale estimator significantly improves the accuracy of the HLL sketch and uses 36% less memory to achieve a given error level. This estimator is provably optimal for any duplicate insensitive approximate distinct counting sketch on a single stream. The single stream scenario also leads to variants in the HLL sketch construction. HLL-TailCut+ uses 45% less memory than the original HLL sketch but at the cost of being dependent on the data insertion order and not being able to merge sketches.

Early life and education  He was born on November 21, 1909 in Pontotoc, Mississippi. He graduated from Mississippi College in 1933. He was awarded a Ph.D. in biology and an M.D. from Johns Hopkins University. He served in the United States Army Medical Corps from 1944 to 1946.  Career  In 1951, he reproduced the procedure developed by John Rock and Miriam Menkin to artificially fertilize eggs. In 1954, he received the annual Markle Prize from Columbia University. Shettles developed a method to maximize the probability of having a baby of the sex of the parents' choice. Using his \\"Shettles Method,\\" couples who wanted to have a male baby should time intercourse as close as possible to ovulation to allow the faster Y-bearing sperm to reach the egg first. Couples desiring a female should time intercourse to take place about three days prior to ovulation, when the pH of the vagina is more acidic and thus more hostile to the faster but less bulky Y-bearing sperm, and therefore favoring the bulkier X-bearing sperm on a small level. In 1973, he was involved with an IVF controversy, the Del-Zio case, at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. After he resigned from the hospital, he moved to Vermont where he worked on cloning at Gifford Medical Center in Randolph, Vermont. He then moved to Las Vegas to resume work on cloning.  Later Life  He retired from work at the Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2000 and moved to Florida. He died on February 6, 2003 in St. Petersburg. Works * *Ovum Humanum, Hafner Pub.

It consists of three amino acid residues (labeled i, i+1 and i+2) in which residue i is an aspartate (Asp) or asparagine (Asn) that forms a hydrogen bond from its sidechain CO group to the mainchain NH group of residue i+2. About 14% of Asx residues present in proteins belong to Asx turns. The name \\"Asx\\" is used here to represent either of the amino acids aspartate (Asp) or asparagine (Asn).  Types  An Asx turn with an aspartate at residue i. One of the sidechain oxygens of the aspartate forms a hydrogen bond (dotted line) with the mainchain NH group of residue i+2. Colors: red, oxygen; grey, carbon; blue, nitrogen. Hydrogen atoms are omitted. Four types of Asx turn can be distinguished: types I, I’, II and II’. These categories correspond to those of the better-known hydrogen-bonded beta turns, which have four residues and a hydrogen bond between the CO of residue i and the NH of residue i+3. Asx turns and beta turns have structurally similar hydrogen-bonded loops and exhibit sidechain-mainchain mimicry in the sense that the sidechain of residue i of the Asx turn mimics the mainchain of residue i of the beta turn. Regarding their occurrence in proteins, they differ in that type I is the commonest of the four beta turns while type II’ is the commonest of the Asx turns.  Occurrence  Asx and ST turns both occur frequently at the N-termini of α-helices. as part of Asx motifs or ST motifs such that the Asx, serine or threonine is the N cap residue. They are thus often regarded as helix capping features.  Related motifs  Similar motifs occur with serine or threonine as residue i, which are called ST turns. In spite of serine and threonine having one less sidechain atom, such that the sidechain-mainchain mimicry of β turns is imperfect, these features occur in proteins as the four types in numbers approaching those of Asx turns. They also exhibit a tendency to substitute each other over evolutionary time. A proportion of Asx turns are accompanied by a mainchain-mainchain hydrogen bond that qualifies them as Asx motifs.

Since 2006, Willms has been involved in several controversies pertaining to his online businesses using negative option billing and has been subject to multiple lawsuits.Clark, 2014 According to his web site, Willms is currently involved in advertising and now resides in Las Vegas (previously Sherwood Park).  Early life  Willms was born in the Alberta countryside in 1987. His mother Linda worked as a revenue property manager, and his father Dave ran a welding-equipment company. According to his mother, Willms developed an early interest in business and trade. At the age of 3 or 4, whenever he went along with his mother to the grocery store, he would make her guide him through each step in the money transaction. A few years later, he spent his paper route wages on business books, learning about how various well-known businessmen, like Warren Buffett, had attained their fortune.Clark, 2014, p. 53. In the early 1990s his family moved to Sherwood Park, an Edmonton suburb. According to his mother, Willms spent a lot of time by himself in the backyard, and despite doing well in school, he never showed any real interest in his studies.  Career  = eDirect Software = Willms started his first business in 2003, at the age of 16. Through an online storefront, eDirect Software, Willms, along with an assembled staff of a dozen people, sold copies of computer software that he had obtained relatively inexpensively from the Jordanian government. The software sold was mainly cheap copies of Microsoft Office, and before long eDirect was one of the largest resellers of Microsoft products on the Internet.Clark, 2014, pp. 53-54.  Lawsuit  Within two years, in March 2006, Microsoft filed a lawsuit against the then 18-year-old Willms, accusing him of dealing in large amounts of \\"counterfeit, tampered and/or infringing\\" copies of Microsoft’s products. Through a court order, Microsoft went through Willms’ PayPal account and discovered that it contained more than $200,000. Microsoft also reviewed eDirect’s software inventories, where they found approximately 66,000 questionable Microsoft products. In February 2007, Willms agreed to a six-figure settlement.Clark, 2014, pp. 54-55. = Just Think Media = After the Microsoft incident, Willms soon thought of a new business idea. The problem with eDirect had been that all of the products he was selling were not, in practice, his. By going through vast quantities of popular web searches, he attempted to find out the top desire of people in order to venture upon the appropriate product. The result was weight-loss products. Using the name of an already existing Chinese tea, supposedly good for burning fat, Willms started to sell his own white-label product tea under the new company name Just Think Media. The tea was marketed and sold through several web sites. The business became such a success that Willms quickly launched other types of alleged health products, such as colon cleansers, teeth whiteners, and acai supplements. The web pages that were used to sell the products were filled with \\"scientific proof\\" and alleged endorsements from celebrities and TV networks.Clark, 2014, pp. 55-56. At its peak in 2009, Just Think Media earned more than $100 million in revenue and had only 20 employees.Clark, 2014, p. 52. = FTC investigation = By late 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) initiated an investigation to scrutinise Willms’ businesses. The impetus for the investigation was the fact that Willms’ companies had, at the time, triggered more complaints from consumers than almost all Internet businesses. According to the FTC investigation, the majority of Willms’ profit came from negative option billing, \\"a practice in which the seller interprets consumers' silence or inaction as permission to charge them\\". In effect, this meant that consumers signing up for \\"free trials\\" of a product were charged with extra fees hidden in the fine print of the terms and conditions. Often consumers first became aware of this after their credit cards had been charged. Also, several different company names appeared on their statements of account, each with a charge of an uneven dollar amount. The FTC claimed that these charges made up the majority of Willms' profits because consumers believed they were legitimate.Clark, 2014, pp. 56-57.  Lawsuit  In May 2011, after an 18-month investigation, the FTC filed a lawsuit against Willms. The lawsuit claimed that Willms, from 2007 to 2011, had conned approximately $467 million from customers in the U.S., Canada, Australia, the UK, and New Zealand. In September 2011, a U.S. District Court Judge froze Willms' assets and prohibited him from continuing to sell products through negative-option. In early 2012, Willms acquiesced to a $359 million settlement. As part of the settlement, Willms also agreed to sell off personal property, including his mansion.Clark, 2014, pp. 52, 60.

Robinson held several public offices in Colonial Virginia and is the patriarch in America for one of the First Families of Virginia.  Early life  Robinson was born in Cleasby, Yorkshire, England in 1645. His parents were John Robinson (d. 1651) and Elizabeth Potter (d. 1688). Christopher was one of eight siblings. His younger brother was John Robinson, Bishop of London and a sister, Clara Robinson, who married Sir Edward Wood, Gentleman Usher to Queen Catherine. A pedigree was created by Christopher's brother, John Robinson, which traced the family back several generations where it becomes, \\"obscure\\". This pedigree was later expanded and published in the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, a publication of the Virginia Historical Society.  Immigration  Robinson emigrated to Virginia about 1666 and settled at Urbanna, Middlesex County, Virginia, on land where the historic Hewick home stands today. The existing home was built and expanded by several generations of Robinsons.  Marriage and legacy  Robinson married first, Agatha Obert, daughter of Bertram Obert, and through this union increased his land holdings in Virginia. Agatha bore about seven children for Chistopher, including John Robinson, who was president of the Governor's Council, then acting governor when Governor Gooch returned to England, and Christopher Robinson, who inherited his father's estate and that of his uncle, John Robinson, Bishop of London. Agatha died January 25, 1686, by today's calendar, and her passing was recorded in the Register of Christ Church Parish in Middlesex County. Next, Christopher married Katherine Hone, the widow of Major Robert Beverley, on September 17, 1687, in Middlesex County. There seems to be some disagreement over whether Katherine was the daughter or the widow of Theophilus Hone. One of Robinson's grandsons was John Robinson, Speaker of the House of Burgesses. Another was Colonel Beverley Robinson, who commanded the Loyal American Regiment during the American War of Independence and was involved in the treason of Benedict Arnold. A great-granddaughter, Judith Robinson, married Carter Braxton, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. The Robinson family was split over the question of independence. Some fought for independence and others remained loyal to the King of England. After the Revolution, the Loyalist family members returned to England or migrated to Canada, where some of the family, among them Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto, enjoyed some considerable success.

Founded in 2012, Robo 3D is a company that started on Kickstarter with their first product the Robo 3D R1. Their product line includes the Robo R1+, Robo C2, and Robo R2, and Robo E3, which all utilize the open materials ideology and are compatible with a variety of 3D modeling softwares, such as Solidworks and Sketch Up, along with free 3D model sharing websites, such as Thingiverse.[1]. Robo 3D shifted their focus to education in early 2018 and have acquired a 300+ lesson 3D printable STEM curriculum platform called MyStemKits.com. Now, with their new Robo E3 3D printer and MyStemKits curriculum, they have a full, turn-key solution for 3D printing in the classroom. History In 2012, a group of students from San Diego State University (SDSU), frustrated by the cost of using the school’s only expensive and industrial 3D printer, set out to create their own 3D printer. The motivation was to create a cheaper alternative to the current leading 3D printing brands. After beginning product development on a dining room table, the group went to Kickstarter to seek funding. With a funding target of $49,000, a total of $649,663 was pledged. On January 16, 2014, Robo3D was mentioned in Time magazine's article on 3D printers at CES. On August 20, 2015, Fine Brothers Entertainment released an episode of 'Elders React to 3D Printers' which features a Robo 3D R1 printer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4blAdS6r3Q When the company's stock debuted on the Australian Securities Exchange, it initially traded for a higher price per share than the initial public offering.

Papis is an Argentine telenovela produced and broadcast by the Telefe network. It premiered on January 6, 2014 and ended on November 27 of the same year. It aired Monday through Friday, except Wednesdays, at 11:30 p.m. The series was written by Cecilia Guerty and Pablo Junovich, and directed by Gustavo Luppi, Omar Aiello and Pablo Vásquez. It starred Luciano Castro, Joaquín Furriel, Luciano Cáceres and Peto Menahem. Plot The story tells the experiences of four modern parents Favio Carbonetti (Luciano Castro), Ignacio Moreno (Joaquín Furriel), Franco Bertossi (Luciano Cáceres) and Mauro de Leone (Peto Menahem) and attractions that make friends by sharing daily talks at the door of your children's kindergarten. In addition to accompanying each other in conflicts, vicissitudes, juggling, surprises and abysses that bring you into paternity, you will be involved in the personal stories of each of them. By sharing the door of the Kindergarten daily, being identified in the problems they face as fathers and feeling even in a world mostly populated by mothers, these four men are joining and consolidating a powerful and endearing friendship. Premise The main topic of the telenovela is male paternity, as the main characters have different back stories but all raise children with little or no female help. This topic was addressed very few times before in Argentine telenovelas, such as in the old telenovelas Papá corazón and Grande, pa!. Somos familia (2014) and Solamente Vos (2013) are other Argentine telenovelas that also explored male paternity. Actor Luciano Cáceres described the main characters as antiheroes, with several emotional weaknesses. Production Actress Julieta Díaz rejected a proposal to work in the telenovela, as she had plans to work in films during 2014. She declined to work in other Argentine fictions, such as Guapas and Viudas e hijos del Rock and Roll, for a similar reason. The production staff proposed that she could appear as a guest star for 25 episodes. She accepted this proposal, and her role in the story will be that of a cumbia singer, with cumbia songs composed especially for the program. Production will move to neighbouring Brazil to film scenes for the program during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. It is not confirmed if Cáceres will take part in the project, as he also performs in theater plays. Reception The program premiered on January 6, 2014. It received 13.9 rating points, prevailing over the telenovelas aired by El Trece.

In 1925 plans were drawn up by J. Armstrong of Leeds for a new church hall to be built next to the presbytery. Unfortunately, work came to a halt soon afterwards, supposedly because of ‘the fraudulent activities of the architect’. Three years later, the new architect Edward Simpson brought the construction to a close by finishing the building in 1930. He altered the designs of the building so that it could be used as both a chapel and a church hall. It was named Sacred Heart Chapel after the main parish church it was attached to. In 1932, a new choir gallery and organ were built at the west side of the chapel. In 1939, a hall for the 'Boys' Club' was built, which became the present church hall. =Our Lady of Lourdes Church= In 1947, the Jesuits withdrew from the area and handed over the entire Sacred Heart parish, both the parish church and the chapel of ease, to the Diocese of Leeds, who continue to minister to the local Catholic population.Our Lady of Lourdes from jeannejuganleeds.org.uk.

It is located near the Minho River and the Portuguese border. It consists of twelve houses and measures around . History The hamlet was founded in the 15th century. The site at A Barca was once part of the royal road to Castille, and the river Minho could be crossed by boat there. The hamlet derives its name from this, with barco meaning \\"boat\\" in Spanish. By the 1920s, the business of transporting people and goods from one side of the river to the other had collapsed due to the construction of a bridge nearby. The inhabitants then invested in the growing of grapes. =Abandonment= The building of the Frieira dam in the 1950s led to higher water levels and the flooding of the land near A Barca. The electricity company Unión Fenosa later bought out the hamlet residents. The construction of the dam, combined with the rerouting of trade routes, led to the abandonment of the village. On 14 January 2013, the company Gas Natural, successor to Unión Fenosa, gave ownership of the hamlet to the municipality. By the date of the transfer, the municipality already had plans for the hamlet to be turned into a tourist site. =Sale= As of March 2014, the whole hamlet is to be given away for free to a new owner who promises to redevelop the village and preserve the buildings, as the municipality lacks funds to do so. The mayor of Cortegada, Avelino Luis de Francisco Martínez, has said the municipality wishes to generate economic activity in the area by the sale of the hamlet. Since the hamlet was up for offer, there have been close to a thousand requests for information, but no serious candidates. The municipality is looking for a designation in the area of tourism. There have already been offers to construct a luxury resort, a clinic, a hippie community, a cheese factory and a meditation complex. The current twelve buildings, four of which have multiple floors, are currently in a state of disrepair with only walls still standing. Due to severe overgrowth of vegetation, the hamlet cannot be seen from the air. Transportation The hamlet is only accessible by a non- paved path diverging from the road towards Celanova.

Murals  In 1939, Philip Guston taught Getz how to mix casein tempera, a milk-based pigment utilized for mural painting, and suggested that Getz apply for a New Deal mural contract.The Creative Expression, North River Press, 1975, p. 78 Over the next four years, Getz won four mural contracts: * 1939: Post Office, Lancaster, New York * 1939: Textile Building, 1939 New York World's FairThe Art of Arthur Getz: The New Yorker Covers , by John Dirks; at the Traditional Fine Arts Organization; published November 26, 2010; retrieved March 15, 2014 * 1941: Post Office, Bronson, Michigan * 1942: Post Office, Luverne, Alabama  The New Yorker  After serving in the Philippines during World War II as a First Lieutenant of Field Artillery, Getz returned to New York City and resumed his work as an artist, soon becoming one of the more regular contributors to The New Yorker. During the 1950s and 1960s it was not unusual for more than one Getz cover to be printed on The New Yorker during a single month. The writer John Updike, in his foreword to The Complete Book of Covers from The New Yorker, 1925 – 1989, wrote: \\"The artist who has contributed most covers is Arthur Getz, whose alert eye and confident brush find endless silent dramas of contrast and tone in the world around us; beginning in 1938 and still producing, he has thus far published two hundred and thirteen.\\" The Complete Book of Covers from The New Yorker, 1925 – 1989, Alfred A. Knopf, 1989, p. vi Lee Lorenz, the former Art Editor of The New Yorker, wrote of Getz: \\"[He] seems to have found his particular subject, the special light of Manhattan … Arthur's paintings are a chronicle of New York's moods to be set alongside Guardi's paintings of Venice.\\"The Art of The New Yorker, 1925 - 1995, Alfred A. Knopf, 1995, p. 117 Lorenz also wrote of Getz, \\"He drew inspiration equally from the night clubs of Manhattan and the apple orchards of New England, but his covers, taken as a group, seem really to be about the joy of painting itself.\\"\\"Family Album: Arthur Getz\\" - The New Yorker, February 5, 1996 In addition to his work as an illustration artist, Getz continued to pursue fine art painting. In 1960 he was offered a one-man show at the Babcock Gallery in New York City. The gallery director requested that Getz, already well known for his covers, exhibit his fine art under a different name, concerned that Getz's association with \\"commercial\\" (illustration) art would hinder his recognition as a fine artist. Getz used his middle name, Kimmig, for his signature on his fine art work. Many paintings from this era are signed \\"Kimmig\\"; some Getz re-signed later and are signed both \\"Kimmig\\" and \\"Getz.\\"A Century of American Illustration, Brooklyn Museum Press, 1972, p. 146 In 1963 Getz and his first wife, Margarita Gibbons,http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htmq=set_name:%22Margarita+Gibbons+papers%2C+1938-1975%22 were divorced. Getz later married writer Anne Carriere, and shortly after relocated from New York City to Sharon, Connecticut in 1969, where Getz lived until his death in 1996. His move to Connecticut marked a shift in the mood of his New Yorker covers from the city-centered work of his past. He began to depict more rural scenes of the countryside, familiar to the growing commuter and weekender populations. During this time Getz also wrote and illustrated four children's books and illustrated numerous others, including Jennifer's Walk, authored by Anne Carriere (Getz and Carriere divorced in 1973). On August 29, 1988, Getz's 213th and final New Yorker cover was printed. Though a stroke rendered Getz blind in one eye in 1994, he continued to paint and draw until his death on January 19, 1996, at the age of 83.

Display  The unit features a blue-green, light- emitting vacuum fluorescent display (VFD). The display device itself has 9 seven segment digits, 8 of which are used for numeric output, the 9th being for the minus sign or to accommodate a space for 6+2 scientific notation. Although only capable of displaying 6 figures when using scientific notation, the calculator works internally to 8. A vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) is a display device used commonly on consumer-electronics equipment such as video cassette recorders, car radios, and microwave ovens. A VFD operates on the principle of cathodoluminescence, roughly similar to a cathode ray tube, but operating at much lower voltages.  Design  The physical design was an impressive step forward from previous, more boxy, models such as the fx-19; sporting three rows of scientific function keys, a stylish metal fascia and rather novel four-position slide switch on the right side. This switch is used to select the trigonometric mode (Degrees, Radians or Gradians) or statistical operation. The unit is pocket sized and originally came with a black plastic slip cover to protect it.  Features  As well as the four standard functions and a memory, it has square root, square, change sign, reciprocal, factorial, pi, powers, trigonometry, common and natural logarithms as well as statistics and the following: * Fractions. Casio continued to offer their unique rational number arithmetic first introduced in the AL-10, along with their novel use of an \\"L\\"-shaped character to display \\"over\\". Due to limitations both in working with rationals and the display, only 3 digit numerators or denominators are allowed, otherwise the value reverts to floating point. * Time Arithmetic. The fx-39 has no real-time clock, but it can add and subtract hours, minutes and seconds displaying the result in sexagesimal. The degree symbol is represented by a small \\"zero\\" made from the upper four segments of the display (like an 8 without the bottom loop). Casio introduced a number of improvements which were to be continued into subsequent models: * Parentheses the previous model, the fx-29, did not have parentheses despite also being a scientific calculator. The fx-39 has 6 levels of brackets. * Operator Precedence. The fx-39 was one of the first to offer order of operations, where 2+3*5 is 17 and not 25. This feature is almost universally assumed on modern scientific calculators, but this was a new feature in 1978. In contrast the fx-29 did not have operator precedence. * Hyperbolic Functions. Casio introduced hyperbolic functions in the fx-39 along with their inverses. To accommodate this, the \\"arc\\" key of the previous models was changed into the, now familiar, \\"inv\\" key. In the previous version, the hyperbolic functions had to be carried out by using the exponential (e^x) function key, employing the formulas: sinh x = (e^x – e^-x)/2 and cosh x = (e^x + e^-x)/2.  Power  The unit is powered by 2 AA cells held within the battery compartment, which occupies a cavity behind the display. Alternatively, it can be powered using the Casio mains adapter through a socket on the top of the unit.

From J.C. Penny catalog copy to counterintelligence manuals and autopsy reports, War Rug is a fierce yet unfortunate reminder of the absolute horrors of our age.”—Mark Nowak, author of Coal Mountain Elementary “Levato's Elegy for Dead Languages, while a more baroque and sculpted collection, is also a powerful testament to modernity. Levato traces the blind-spots of war, particularly controversial American interventions in the Middle East. Elegy for Dead Languages is an imagistic tour de force, and Levato's unsparing lens is just the sort these subjects deserve and require. The collection's poems seem unduly cerebral only if we forget -- as we must never forget -- that these are real appendages being torn apart, real pieties being eviscerated, real landscapes being ravaged. Brian Turner has already given us a view of war from the front lines; Levato's perspective is a more distant but also (perhaps in consequence of its distance) an even more comprehensive one. It is right that we should again be troubled by poetry; and it is right that when poetry troubles us it should move us not merely to emotion but to action. Levato's book meets the high standards not only of testament but also -- albeit in the sociopolitical, rather than militaristic sense -- a call-to-arms. The horrors of war are too easily rendered as Kantian sublimities for which the stateside mind can find no objective correlative; Levato suffuses us, instead, in the facts, figures, and bureaucratic speech out of which real-time horrors are in actuality composed. A necessary and suitably unforgiving book.”—Seth Abramson, Huffington Post “Politically charged investigation raises the stakes of poetry for both the poet (as producer) and the poem (as art object). This type of poetry not only invokes the bardic practice of speaking the wisdom of the group, but also uses the poem as a type of activism. When critics question the role of poetry in the real world or what it can accomplish outside of its own existence, activist poetics that enters conversation with contemporary political happenings offers one of the better answers. This activist poetry can reveal knowledge about real happenings through the conceptual relationship between the real and the world of art.” —Steve Halle, A review of “War Rug,” Jacket2 “Levato is himself an avant-garde poet whose work draws on cinematic and documentary techniques—in his own words, “engages subject matter through disruption of content and form, fragmentation of narrative and radical juxtaposition of visual and textual elements.” His poems, truly products of postmodern culture, sample: they collect, cut and redistribute pieces of other poems into new configurations. One long work, “Aurora,” makes a fragmented, haunting dialogue of pieces of Robert Browning’s and Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s poems. A significant part of Levato’s work is something called cinépoetry, a kind of collaged videographic poetry that does with footage what his other work does with language. Levato also translates, a kind of work vitally connected to his poetic work, which involves so much transformation of extant materials into new forms.”—Alli Carlisle, Outsider Institution: the Avant-Garde Pedagogy of the Chicago School of Poetics  References  * Glass, Philip. \\"\\", Days and Nights Festival, August 31, 2014.

Foundation  According to medieval Iranian scholars, Pushang was the oldest town in Khorasan, and was founded by the Iranian mythological figure Pashang. However, according to modern scholars, it was only said to be founded by Pashang because of his name similarity with the town. Some other sources state that the second Sasanian king Shapur I (r. 240–270), was the founder of the town.  History  In 588, a Nestorian bishopric at Pushang is mentioned. In the 650s, the town was captured by the invading Arabs. After the Abbasid Revolution in 750, Pushang was under the governorship by Mus'ab ibn Ruzaiq, an Iranian companion of the Abbasid general Abu Muslim. Mus'ab's grandson Tahir ibn Husayn would later play an important role in the affairs of the Abbasid Caliphate and establish the Tahirid dynasty, which would rule Pushang and the rest of Khorasan until 873, when the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar wrested Khorasan from him. During the decline of the Saffarid dynasty in the early 10th-century, the town was captured by the Samanids. According to the 10th-century traveler Ibn Hawqal, the town was half the size of Herat. He also states that the town was well-built, being surrounded by three gates. In 998, the town was captured by the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud. After the battle of Dandanaqan in 1040, the city was seized by the Seljuq Turks. In 1152, Pushang was briefly occupied by the Ghurid ruler Ala al-Din Husayn, who was defeated and captured by the Seljuq ruler Ahmad Sanjar. In 1163, Pushang was once again occupied by the Ghurids, this the Seljuqs being unable to re-capture it. During the Mongol invasion (1206–1337), Pushang was destroyed, but after some time managed to recover. In 1245, the town was captured by the Kurt ruler Shams-uddin Muhammad Kurt I. During the 14th-century, the town was famous for its water melons and grapes. In 1381, the Turko-Mongol ruler Timur had the town destroyed after having made the last Kurt ruler, Ghiyas-uddin Pir 'Ali his vassal. However, the town was later restored and is mentioned many times by the Iranian historian Hafiz-i Abru. During the early modern period, Pushang was destroyed due to land disputes between the Safavids, Uzbeks and the Afghans. However, the town was once again revived and is today known by the name of Ghurian.

After showing promise in National Hunt Flat races he won five times as a novice hurdler in the 2012/2013 season, with his victories including the Fishery Lane Hurdle, Royal Bond Novice Hurdle, Future Champions Novice Hurdle and Evening Herald Champion Novice Hurdle. In the following season he won the WKD Hurdle and the Hatton's Grace Hurdle before taking the 2014 Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham Racecourse and following up with a win in the Racing Post Champion Hurdle. In the following season he was beaten in his first three races by Hurricane Fly and finished fourth to Faugheen in the Champion Hurdle before winning the Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles and defeating Hurricane Fly in the World Series Hurdle. Background Jezki is a bay horse with a white star and snip bred in Ireland by Gerard M. McGrath. He is one of the best horses sired by Milan who won the St Leger Stakes and finished second in the Breeders' Cup Turf in 2001. His other progeny include Darlan, who won the Christmas Hurdle in 2012, but was killed in his next race. Jezki' dam La Noire had previously produced Jered, who won the Evening Herald Champion Novice Hurdle in 2008. During his racing career, Jezki has been owned by J. P. McManus and trained at Moone, County Kildare by Jessica Harrington. Racing career =2011/2012 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races= Jezki began his racing career in National Hunt Flat races beginning with an event restricted to four-year-olds at Leopardstown Racecourse on 28 January 2012. Starting at odds of 4/1 he took the lead in the closing stages and won by three quarters of a length from Ned Buntine. He followed up at the same course on 4 March, beating The Big Easy by two lengths and was then sent to England to contest the Grade I Champion Bumper at the Cheltenham Festival ten days later. Ridden by Robbie Power he started at 12/1 and finished eighth of the twenty runner behind Champagne Fever. =2012/2013 National Hunt season: Novice hurdle races= In the 2012/2013 season Jezki was mainly campaigned in novice hurdle races. He prepared for the National Hunt season by finishing fifth in a flat race at Navan Racecourse on 10 October. Ridden for the first time by Barry Geraghty, he made his debut over obstacles at Naas Racecourse on 29 October and prevailed by three quarters of a length from the odds-on favourite Ally Cascade. Twelve days later at the same course he won the Grade III Fishery Lane Hurdle, beating seven opponents at odds of 13/8. The gelding was then moved up in class for the Grade I Royal Bond Novice Hurdle at Fairyhouse in December in which he was matched against Champagne Fever for the second time. He was retrained by Geraghty in the early stages before overtaking Champagne Fever at the last hurdle and winning by one and a half lengths. At the end of the month, Jezki, ridden by Robbie Power, started 11/8 favourite for the Grade I Future Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown Racecourse and won easily by six lengths from the Dermot Weld-trained Waaheb. Jezki made his second appearance at the Cheltenham Festival in March 2013 when he started 5/1 second favourite for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. He appeared to be making progress when he made a mistake at the last hurdle and finished third behind Champagne Fever and My Tent Or Yours. Jezki and Champagne Fever met for the fourth time in the Herald Champion Novice Hurdle at the Punchestown Festival on 23 April. Starting the 2/1 second favourite he overtook his main rival early in the straight and went clear of the field approaching the last, winning by sixteen lengths from Ted Veale, with Champagne Fever in third place. =2013/2014 National Hunt season= Jezki (right) wins the Champion Hurdle from My Tent Or Yours. A. P. McCoy took over as Jezki's regular jockey for the 2013/2014 season. The gelding began his third season in the WKD Hurdle, a Grade II handicap race at Down Royal and won \\"comfortably\\" under top weight of 164 pounds. Jezki was then stepped up in distance for the Grade I Hatton's Grace Hurdle over two and a half miles at Fairyhouse on 1 December. Starting the 4/6 favourite, he took the lead after the second to last hurdle and won by one and three quarter lengths from the Willie Mullins-trained Zaidpour. On 29 December, Jezki was matched against the reigning Champion Hurdler Hurricane Fly and the Triumph Hurdle winner Our Conor in the Ryanair Hurdle over two miles at Leopardstown. He finished second of the five runners, two and a half lengths behind Hurricane Fly. In the Irish Champion Hurdle over the same course and distance, he finished last of the four runners behind Hurricane Fly, Our Conor and Captain Cee Bee. In the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham, Jezki was ridden by Geraghty as McCoy had opted to ride the Nicky Henderson- trained My Tent Or Yours who was also owned by J P McManus. Wearing a hood for the first time he started the 9/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Hurricane Fly, My Tent Or Yours The New One and Our Conor. All nine of the runners were previous Grade I winners. Geraghty tracked the leaders before sending Jezki up to take the lead from the pacemaker Captain Cee Bee at the second last. He first repelled a challenge from Hurricane Fly and then held off the late run of My Tent Or Yours to claim the championship by a neck. The New One finished strongly to take third, two and a half lengths further back. Only Hurricane Fly and the outsider Steps To Freedom appeared to oppose Jezki when he started 4/5 favourite for the Racing Post Champion Hurdle at Punchestown on 2 May. Ridden by McCoy, he took the lead from the start and held off a challenge from Hurricane Fly at the last hurdle to win by three and three-quarter lengths. =2014/2015 National Hunt season= Jezki began the new season in the Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown on 29 November in which he was matched against Hurricane Fly and the improving mare Little King Robin. He raced in second behind the mare before taking the lead at the second last but was then overtaken by Hurricane Fly. He made a mistake at the last and finished second, beaten two and a half lengths by Hurricane Fly. Jezki met Hurricane Fly again in the Ryanair Hurdle at Leopardstown in December. He took the lead in the straight but was overtaken by his rival on the run in and beaten half a length. The Irish Champion Hurdle in January saw yet another meeting between Jezki and Hurricane Fly, with the pair starting at odds of 5/4 and 11/8 respectively. Jezki took the lead at the second lead but made bad mistake at the final hurdle and finished third behind Hurricane Fly and Arctic Fire. On 10 March at the 2015 Cheltenham Festival, Jezki attempted to repeat his 2014 success in the Champion Hurdle. His seven opponents included Hurricane Fly, The New One and the previously undefeated Faugheen. Starting the 6/1 third choice in the betting he moved up into second place behind Faugheen three hurdles from the finish but was hampered when the leader made a jumping error. He kept on in the closing stages without ever looking likely to win and finished fourth of the eight runners behind Faugheen, Arctic Fire and Hurricane Fly, beaten more than eight lengths by the winner. On 9 April was matched against Arctic Fire and the 2012 Champion Hurdler Rock On Ruby in the Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles. He was held up by McCoy before moving up into second place behind Arctic Fire approaching the last. When Arctic Fire fell at the final hurdle, Jezki was left with a clear lead and won by thirteen lengths from Rock On Ruby, being eased down by McCoy in the closing stages. Harrington commented \\"It's great to get him back in the winner's enclosure. They've been hard races all season and he's been on the go for a long time but he was very tough today\\". Three weeks later he was moved up to three miles for the World Series Hurdle at Punchestown for which he started 5/2 second favourite behind Hurricane Fly. With Mark Walsh taking over from the recently retired McCoy he was restrained in the early stages before moving into fourth at the eleventh of the fourteen hurdles. He took the lead approaching the last and stayed on to win by one and three quarter lengths from Hurricane Fly with a gap of eight lengths back to Zabana in third. In September 2015 it was announced that Jezki had sustained a leg injury and would probably miss the whole of the 2015/2016 National Hunt season.

Brincidofovir is a prodrug of cidofovir. Conjugated to a lipid, the compound is designed to release cidofovir intracellularly, allowing for higher intracellular and lower plasma concentrations of cidofovir, effectively increasing its activity against dsDNA viruses, as well as oral bioavailability. In animal trials the drug has shown activity against cytomegalovirus, adenoviruses, BK virus, poxviruses, and herpes simplex viruses. It appears to have potential for the treatment of Ebola virus disease, which is somewhat paradoxical, as Ebola does not contain DNA.  Adenovirus and cytomegalovirus  , brincidofovir is in Phase III clinical trials for use in humans against cytomegalovirus and adenovirus. Preliminary safety data from a database of 1000 patients supported progression into later phase trials, Chimerix announced in December 2015 that the Phase III trials for use of the drug in preventing cytomegalovirus infection in stem cell transplant patients had failed, and in February 2016 shut down two other late-stage trials for use of the drug in preventing infection after kidney transplants. Brincidofovir is not yet FDA approved for adenovirus or cytomegalovirus due to lack of efficacy in clinical trials. In a trial of brincidofovir for patients with CMV brincidofovir was associated with a 15.5% week 24 all-cause mortality compared with 10.1% among placebo recipients. Additionally brincidofovir was associated with increased serious adverse events (57.1% versus 37.6%) compared with placebo. Brincidofovir was initially offered via an FDA expanded access trial; however as of May 9, 2019, Chimerix discontinued clinical trials of brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus and discontinued the expanded access program in 2019.  Ebola  On October 6, 2014, Chimerix received an FDA authorization for emergency investigational new drug applications of brincidofovir for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. Brincidofovir was administered to the first patient diagnosed in the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the US in 2014. The patient was given the drug starting six days after hospital admission when he was already critically ill; he died four days later. Brincidofovir was also given to Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo at the Nebraska Medical Center, who had developed the disease and then was pronounced Ebola-free and released from the Center on 22 October 2014. In October 2014, Chimerix reported it had been given approval by the FDA to start Phase 2 trials in patients infected with ebolaviruses for brincidofovir's safety, tolerability, and efficacy. Organised by a team of scientists at the University of Oxford, including Peter Horby, Jake Dunning, Laura Merson and Trudie Lang, a trial commenced during January 2015 in Liberia, but was subsequently discontinued. Because of a lack of suitable subjects in Liberia, Oxford University and Médecins Sans Frontières planned to extend the trial to Sierra Leone, where there were still Ebola cases; but on the 30th of January 2015, the manufacturer decided to withdraw support for the trial and end discussion of future trials. Ethical considerations Brincidofovir (CMX001) was the subject of widespread social media campaigning in 2014, which was then picked up by national news sources about a boy with an adenovirus infection following a bone marrow transplant. The family requested legal access to the still-unapproved drug outside of any clinical trial, and Chimerix initially denied the request. After a short and intense media campaign, Chimerix got permission from the FDA to start a limited open-label trial which allowed the boy to receive the drug. This media event sparked a debate on the ethics of using social media, the allocation of limited resources of a small company, and the emphasis on the individual over the group. The new use of any drug has the potential to interfere with the process to get the drug approved and widely marketed, through means such as consuming limited staff time that may be needed elsewhere – staff time that has the potential to save thousands of lives in the long-term, rather than one life now – overwhelming manufacturing capabilities, or by causing adverse effects or even death. These adverse events are more likely during these programs, because the people seeking access are usually much sicker than most, and problems experienced by these people can result in an unfavorable and inaccurate perception of the drug's safety profile. In this case, the boy recovered from the infection in 2014, and died in 2016 from complications of cancer. Brincidofovir is one of several experimental drugs administered to a small number of patients to treat Ebola virus disease during the 2014 outbreak. The WHO published a report on the ethics of using unregistered interventions to treat Ebola, where they concluded that \\"In the particular context of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, it is ethically acceptable to offer unproven interventions that have shown promising results in the laboratory and in animal models but have not yet been evaluated for safety and efficacy in humans as potential treatment or prevention.\\"  See also  * BCX4430 * Favipiravir * FGI-106 * JK-05 * Lamivudine * TKM-Ebola * ZMapp  References   Further reading  * Category:Antivirals Category:Ebola Category:Pyrimidones Category:Phosphonate esters Category:Prodrugs Category:Anti-herpes virus drugs Category:Experimental drugs ","title":"Brincidofovir"},{"id":"42176121","text":"Tenirberdi Suiunbaev (born 5 September 1994) is a Kyrgyzstani middle-distance runner.

Folk tradition attributes the establishment of Stuplje to King Dragutin, a member of the Serbian Nemanjić dynasty, as is the case with other Serbian monasteries in northern Bosnia. The earliest mention of Stuplje is found in a chronicle dated to the second half of the 15th century. The monastery was probably founded before 1450, and thus before the Ottoman conquest of the Kingdom of Bosnia in 1463. This conquest did not include north-western Bosnia, which then became part of the Kingdom of Hungary, to be conquered by the Ottomans in 1527 and 1528. During the 17th century, the monks of Stuplje were active in transcribing religious books. At some point during the Great Turkish War (1683–1699), the monastery was burned down by the Ottomans. Surviving monks fled north across the Sava River and found refuge in the Orahovica Monastery in Slavonia. They brought with them a number of their manuscript books, which thus became part of the Orahovica library. In time, all traces of the Stuplje Monastery disappeared from the face of the earth. In the 20th century, Stuplje was a historical term with an uncertain location, assumed to be somewhere in the area of Teslić and in the vicinity of the Liplje Monastery. In March 1994, this area was visited by archaeologists who searched for Stuplje in the village of Gornji Vijačani at a locality named Crkvište, near a stream called Manastirica and a hill called Kaluđersko Brdo. The toponyms Crkvište, Manastirica, and Kaluđersko were indicative, being derived from the Serbian crkva, manastir, and kaluđer, meaning \\"church\\", \\"monastery\\", and \\"monk\\", respectively. The archaeologists uncovered the foundation of a church building in the form of a basilica, 14 metres in length and 7.5 metres in width. The uppermost layer of stones was 30 centimetres below the ground surface. Within and around the foundation, there was a layer of burned debris. The archaeologists revisited the site in 1997, when they uncovered the foundation of a monastic building to the north and west of the church foundation. Scholars concluded that these finds were remains of the Stuplje Monastery. Afterwards, on the initiative of the head of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Banja Luka, it was decided to rebuild the monastery at the site of the archaeological finds, although some people demanded that the excavated foundations be conserved and the site protected from any disturbance. The Stuplje Monastery was rebuilt and consecrated at the end of 2008.

Construction and dimensions The Monarch was built by Mollwaine, Lewis & Co., Belfast in 1885, and was owned and operated by Alexander King Ltd, Belfast. Length 155'; beam 22'; depth 11'; with an i.h.p. of 600. Monarch had a design speed of approximately 10 knots. Collision with the RMS Peveril On the night of Saturday 16 September 1899, under the command of her Master, Captain Alexander McCullough, the Monarch left Workington, Cumberland, with a cargo of 360 tons of flue-ash (a valuable ore-bearing material)Manx Sun. 23 Sep 1899 for the Villiers Spelter Company, Swansea. She arrived off St Bees Head at 20:35 and set a course for Skerries. The was a dual passenger and cargo steamer owned and operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. She was built by the Barrow Shipbuilding Company, Barrow-in-Furness in 1884, and was of Under the command of her Master, Capt. William Woods, Peveril departed Queen's Dock, Port of Liverpool at 19:50 and passed the Bar Lightship at 21:17 when she set a course bound for Douglas. At 00:25 as the Monarch was to the northeast of Douglas, Isle of Man, her lookout, George Caddell, spotted the light on the Peveril's masthead away to port. On board the Peveril, First Officer Thomas Webb and the Peveril's lookout, A.B. Joseph Corris observed the masthead light and then the port navigation lights of another vessel which could be seen off the Peveril's starboard quarter, with the range decreasing and the bearing remaining constant. The starboard light of the Peveril and the port light of the Monarch maintained a constant bearing, and neither ship appeared to alter course. With collision imminent, Captain McCullough ordered \\"full astern\\" on the Monarch's ship's telegraph, and this instruction was duly carried out by her Chief Engineer, Morris Flinn. At the same time, First Officer Webb ordered the Peveril's helm hard to starboard and gave two blasts on the ship's whistle. At 01:00, 14 miles southeast of Douglas. the Monarch rammed the Peveril amidships, just abreast of the funnel, flooding the engine room. Upon receiving a report of the damage inflicted, it was clear to Capt. Woods that the Peveril would founder, and the necessary provisions were made to abandon ship. The Monarch stood by whilst the Peveril's lifeboats were lowered, which then made their way towards the Monarch. There were 30 crew members on board the Peveril and one passenger. The Peveril sank stem first in 40 minutes.Ramsey Courier. 19 Sep 1899 The position of the wreck of Peveril is given as . SS Monarch pictured at the South Quay, Douglas, following her collision with Peveril. The extensive damage to her bow is clearly visible. Aftermath The Monarch then made her way to Douglas Harbour with the Peveril's solitary passenger, her ship's company aboard; and towing two of her lifeboats astern. Monarch arrived at the Victoria Pier at 04:00. However, the Monarch had also sustained serious damage. Her stem was stoved in, and had it not been for an extra-strong collision bulkhead she may well also of foundered. On discharging the Peveril's crew and passenger, the Monarch moved across the harbour to the Red Pier; and then to the South Quay in order for repairs to be effected, where she attracted considerable attention from the public. A report in the Ramsey Courier; Tuesday, 19 September 1899, stated that the Monarch's bow was covered by canvas in order to obscure the result of the impact, but the entirety could not be fully hidden. Damage could be seen in the shape of a hole, extending several feet below the waterline, as well as damage to her plating stretching back approximately 20 feet, as a consequence of striking the Peveril's belting. In accordance with the provisions of The Merchant Shipping Act 1894, both First Officer Webb of the Peveril, together with Captain McCullough of the Monarch were summoned to appear before an inquiry held at the Custom House, Douglas, on Monday 18 September 1899, presided over by the Receiver of Wrecks, Mr. M. J. Cahill, as to the events surrounding the loss of the Peveril. During the course of the hearing, unsurprisingly, Mr. Webb blamed the Monarch stating:- As would be expected, during the course of his deposition, Capt. McCullough made a different assertion:- Illustration of how vessels should avoid each other when a risk of collision exists. From the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, it would appear that the crew of the Peveril were to blame. International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea; Part B – Steering and sailing; Section II (for vessels in sight of one another); Article 15. Crossing situations stating:- :\\"When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.\\" References ;Bibliography *Chappell, Connery (1980).

It premiered on February 14, 2013 on ABC. The episode marks the beginning of the 9 episode arc of the second half of Scandal which operated independently from the first half of the season. The episode marks the first appearance of Scott Foley as Jake Ballard who would later go on to be a series regular. Plot The episode begins ten months after the events of Nobody Likes Babies. Olivia flashes back to intimate moments she spent with Fitz while swimming in a pool. Meanwhile, Fitz drinks in the middle of his morning shower and is joined by Mellie. Cyrus interrupts them to inform Fitz that four American soldiers have been taken hostage in Kashfar. Across town David Rosen wakes up beside the body of a slain woman. When the police knock of his door claiming that they are there to investigate a disturbance he brushes them off. Olivia waits in line for her morning coffee and has her cellphone knocked out of her hand by a man (Scott Foley) who proceeds to flirt with her. She then receives a call from Abby and she joins her and the rest of their team at David’s apartment where they gather that he was framed for the murder of Wendy Westerberg. Olivia offers to move Wendy's body out of David’s apartment and back to her own house to deflect suspicion from David. As the gladiators try to investigate who would have framed David they discover that he now works as a high school teacher. Fitz meets with the ambassador to Kashfar. Cyrus is confused as to why he has been shut out of the meeting but when he asks Fitz what is wrong Fitz denies that there is a problem. Huck manages to hack into Wendy’s files where he discovered photos of multiple nude men. The gladiators discover that Wendy blackmailed powerful men for stories which she sold to tabloids. They realize that she tried to seduce David in order to find out the truth about the voter fraud in Defiance. David grows suspicious that he was set up for the murder by Olivia and she in turn takes her suspicions to Cyrus. Cyrus denies involvement in David’s set up. Meanwhile, David is taken in for questioning on suspicion of Wendy’s murder though he quickly manages to deflect suspicion based on the ridiculousness of the prosecutors claims. Mellie and Cyrus meanwhile try to figure out whether Fitz knows about Defiance, as suggested by Olivia. While trying to discover who murdered Wendy, Huck notices that her cell phone is ringing with the number belonging to someone in the pentagon: Captain Jake Ballard. When Olivia goes to investigate she discovers that Jake Ballard is the man whom she flirted with earlier that morning. He is only able to tell her that Wendy offered him some information a few days previously. Before she leaves Jake invites her to dinner but Olivia declines. Fitz decides to send a SEAL team in to save the U.S. soldiers but Cyrus convinces him to wait. Shortly after, on the way to the christening of Cyrus’s child, Mellie admits to Defiance to Fitz and then tells him it was Cyrus’s fault and that Fitz is right to attempt to cut him out. She then urges Fitz to listen to his instincts and send in the SEAL team. At Ella’s christening Olivia and Fitz exchange meaningful looks and at the party afterwards they break away to have sex in a mechanical closet. Afterwards Olivia confesses to Defiance but Fitz reiterates that they are over. Directly afterwards he is called to watch the rescue of the soldiers and is shocked when there is no one at the building where the hostages are supposedly being kept. He realizes they have a mole. Meanwhile, Abby goes to David to try and reconnect with him and he shuts her down. David accidentally discovers a flash drive in his apartment belonging to Wendy with secret military intel on it. Taking a shower at the end of the day Fitz is joined again by Mellie but when she tries to initiate sex he screams at her before apologizing and crying. Upon returning home, Olivia calls Jake in order to accept his invitation to dinner. As they discuss potential venues for their dinner date Jake sits down on his couch in front of a wall of TV screens displaying images of Olivia and the inside of her apartment. Production News of Scott Foley’s casting was revealed in January 2013. Foley had previously appeared on Grey’s Anatomy, also created by Shonda Rhimes.

In the report, the government would have to explain why it had decided not to enforce that law. The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014 would expand the circumstances under which the Attorney General is required to report to Congress regarding the enforcement of laws to include any instance in which the Attorney General, an officer of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), or any other federal officer establishes or implements a policy to refrain from: (1) enforcing, applying, or administering any federal statute, rule, regulation, program, policy, or other law within the responsibility of the Attorney General or such officer; or (2) adhering to, enforcing, applying, or complying with, a final decision of any court of jurisdiction respecting the application of the Constitution, any statute, rule, regulation, program, policy, or other law within the responsibility of the Attorney General or such officer. (Currently, reports are not required with respect to the policies of other federal officers and reports concerning nonenforcement of a law are required only when the Attorney General or a DOJ officer refrains on grounds that the provision is unconstitutional.) The bill would require such reports to state the grounds for policies of nonenforcement. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on March 5, 2014. This is a public domain source. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 3973 would have no significant cost to the federal government. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. Current law requires the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to submit a report to the Congress if it refrains from enforcing or administering federal laws or regulations because it deems them unconstitutional. H.R. 3973 would direct DOJ to report to the Congress whenever any federal agency refrains from enforcing laws or regulations for any reason. Based on the costs of similar activities currently carried out by DOJ, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would not have a significant effect on the budget because such reporting costs are small and subject to the availability of appropriated funds. H.R. 3973 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives was introduced on January 29, 2014 by Rep. Ron DeSantis (R, FL-6). It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. The committee reported the bill alongside House Report 113-376 on March 7, 2014. On March 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 3973 would be considered on March 12 or 13, 2014. The House was expected to pass a rule governing debate of this bill and one other on March 12 and then vote on this bill on March 13, 2014. Debate and discussion The Hill reports that the bill is a Republican reaction to \\"what they say is a string of decisions from President Obama to ignore the will of Congress and the letter of the law.\\" Republicans point to Obama's changes to provisions and deadlines of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as \\"Obamacare\\") and his changes to the deportation of some immigrants. The bill's sponsor, Rep. DeSantis spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that \\"President Obama has not only failed to uphold several of our nation's laws, he has vowed to continue to do so in order to enact his unpopular agenda... The American people deserve to know exactly which laws the Obama administration is refusing to enforce and why.\\" Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL) spoke out in favor of the bill saying, \\"the Obama Administration has been open and honest about one thing in particular: they have no problem making an end-run around Congress to achieve through administrative means what they cannot legislatively. Placing political convenience above the United States Constitution goes against everything the Founding Fathers intended, and it's time we put a stop to this practice.\\" The OMB said of the Gowdy bill, “violates the separation of powers by purporting to permit the Congress to challenge in court the exercise by the President of one of his core constitutional functions – taking care that Federal laws are faithfully executed.” See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *List of United States federal agencies Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3973 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3973 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3973 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3973 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3973 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3973 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014"},{"id":"42176375","text":"Ruzaiq (also spelled Ruzayq) was an Iranian nobleman who lived during the 7th and 8th-century.

The album is a collection of original songs of trials, temptations, love, and faith. All of the album's songs were written solely by Martin, except \\"In the Arms of God\\" which was written by Eric Kaz and Martin. The album was produced, engineered and mixed by Martin's husband Greg Droman. Hank Williams mastered the album at Mastermix, Nashville. The song \\"Every Way And Always\\" received airplay on Christian and Praise and Worship stations. Background Trust, Love, Pray was Martin's first released studio album since 1988's This Is Serious. Describing the songs as \\"written purely from my heart\\", Martin originally put her solo career on halt in the 1990s. She recalled to Breathe Cast: \\"For several years I just didn't have the heart to try to write or sing\\". However, when her husband introduced her to the music software GarageBand, she began writing new material. Happy to be writing and singing again, Martin did not initially consider releasing a new album. The album, released independently by Martin, was issued digitally and on digipack CD. The CD edition was released in America only, via outlets online such as CDBaby and Amazon. In late 2012, Martin used Kickstarter in an attempt to gain funding of $10,000 to market and promote the album. This included distribution, internet promotion and a possible tour. However by mid- January 2013, the 45-day funding period only gained $1,230 through 12 backers. Track listing Critical reception Timothy Yap of Breathe Cast reviewed the album in 2013, writing: \\"A buffet of styles, there is much to enjoy here: from string-laden big balladry to jaunty soul-filled funk to straight ahead vintage pop. Though the songs are deftly written, some of them lack defining hooks that could grab the listener with greater immediacy. If only Martin could polish up the hooks and make them more prominent, the album would be even greater.

He played college basketball at the University of South Carolina up until his junior year, when he transferred to East Carolina University following the 2010 fall semester.  High school career  After playing for the South Carolina Amateur Athletic Union team in Columbia, South Carolina, Steed attended George P. Butler Comprehensive High School, where he averaged 12 points, 5 rebounds, and 2 assists per game in his sophomore season. His exceptional play continued on to his junior year at Butler High School, averaging 12 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 assists per game by the end of the season. After already being named the team MVP as a sophomore, Steed was considered one of the best high school athletes in Georgia. He was named all-conference, all-regional, and eventually all-state, ultimately winning the award for Georgia Athletic Coaches Association (GACA) Player of the Year. This was his reward for averaging a stunning nineteen points, seven rebounds, and five assists during his final season. Before going to college, Steed represented Fork Union Military Academy, where he played basketball under head coach Fletcher Arritt. There, he finished the season averaging 12.0 points and 7.5 rebounds. Austin Steed chose to play for the South Carolina Gamecocks over other possibilities such as Georgia and Tennessee Volunteers.  College career  = South Carolina = In his freshman season with the South Carolina Gamecocks, Austin Steed did not find that he fitted in a team that was based, statistically, on Cincinnati Bearcats transfer Devan Downey. As the Gamecocks finished the season with a disappointing 14-18 record, 10th place in the Southeastern Conference, Steed averaged just 2.0 points and 2.0 rebounds, in only six games played. Although Devan Downey continued to lead the team in scoring for Austin Steed's sophomore season, the Gamecocks finished the regular season with a winning record of 21-10. Steed played his first full regular season of 31 games, averaging 3.9 points and 3.6 rebounds. By the end of Austin Steed's junior season, four players were averaging double digits, which gave him less opportunities to familiarize his name. Downey, who was in his final season at college was averaging over 20 points, also leading the team in minutes, steals, and assists. Steed, on the other hand, was averaging below 3.0 points even though he had the opportunity to play thirty games. However, against #1 Kentucky, Austin Steed made a game-saving block with only a few minutes left to go in the second half, helping the Gamecocks win the game Even after this, South Carolina finished the season with a 15-16 record. Soon after the season came to a close, Austin Steed made the decision to transfer from the University of South Carolina to East Carolina University. He earned an undergraduate degree in retail after three and a half years in South Carolina. According to De Pierce, who ran the South Carolina Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team Steed played for, \\"Austin loves being a Gamecock and wants a degree from the University of South Carolina.\\"Austin Steed, USC, part ways Austin Steed did not play basketball in the 2010-11 season due to ineligibility issues. = East Carolina = With East Carolina, Steed did not see major changes in play time himself.

He was the 8th leading scorer by the end of his senior year, finishing with a career-high scoring, rebounding, and assisting average.Austin Steed Player Profile, RealGM  Professional career  Austin Steed went undrafted in the 2012 NBA Draft, making him an unrestricted free agent.

An airline service trolley, also known as an airline catering trolley, airline meal trolley, or trolley cart, is a small serving cart supplied by an air carrier for use by flight attendants inside the aircraft for transport of beverages, airline meals, and other items during a flight. History The airline service trolley system was introduced in the late 1960s at the same time as a new generation of large \\"widebody\\" aircraft were entering into service with the airlines. The significantly larger number of passengers on these aircraft meant that meals could no longer be efficiently delivered by hand, as they had been up until that time. The growth of at-seat service on long distance rail has led to the adoption of similar service trollies for this purpose. Design The trolley is a rigid box form with castering wheels at each corner that can be braked to hold the trolley in position. Full and half size trollies are made. The front (both full and half size) and rear (full size only) have doors, and handles are provided at the top. There are currently several design families of trolley in use: *ACE - mainly used by British Airways which originated the specification, and produced by Driessen *ATLAS - the most common size, used by approximately 80% of airlines. It was named for the initial group of carriers who originated the specification: Alitalia, TAP, Lufthansa, Air France, and Sabena. *KSSU - named for KLM, Swissair, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, and UTA; also used by Cathay Pacific Individual carriers often customize an existing trolley family for their uses.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background In 2012, a court ruled \\"in favor of the ski companies... that seizing the privately held water rights usurped state water law.\\" However, the United States Forest Service decided to pursue a \\"new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Water Rights Protection Act would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) from: (1) conditioning the issuance, renewal, amendment, or extension of any permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement on the transfer of any water right directly to the United States, or any impairment in title, in whole or in part, granted or recognized under state law, by federal or state adjudication, decree, or other judgment, or pursuant to any interstate water compact; and (2) requiring any water user to apply for a water right in the name of the United States under state law as a condition of such a land use or occupancy agreement. The bill would state that nothing in this Act limits or expands any existing authority of the Secretaries to condition any permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement on federal lands subject to their respective jurisdictions. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on November 14, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3189 would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands. Because Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects that enacting the bill would not affect the number of users of public lands or the amount of receipts received by federal agencies for the use of those lands, we estimate that enacting the bill would have no impact on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 3189 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. H.R. 3189 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Water Rights Protection Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on September 26, 2013 by Rep. Scott R. Tipton (R, CO-3). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, the United States House Committee on Agriculture, the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power, and the United States House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Energy, and Forestry. The bill was ordered reported (amended) by the Committee on Natural Resources on March 4, 2014 alongside House Report 113-372 Part 1. On March 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 3189 would be considered on March 12 or 13, 2014. Debate and discussion The Colorado ski industry supported the bill because it believed the legislation was \\"needed to block a water extortion scheme by the Forest Service to withhold government permits unless the companies relinquish their valuable water rights.\\" Vice President of the Aspen Skiing Company David Corbin testified to the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power that the company would go out of business without the water. Rep. Tipton, who sponsored the bill, said the bill was needed because it \\"provides critical protection for water rights' holders from federal takings by ensuring that federal government agencies cannot extort private property rights through uneven-handed negotiations.\\" Tipton argued that the bill \\"prohibits federal agencies from pilfering water rights through the use of permits, leases, and other land management arrangements, for which it would otherwise have to pay just compensation under the 5th Amendment of the Constitution.\\" Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) also supported the bill, saying that the Forest Service's regulation \\"illustrates an increasingly hostile attitude by this agency toward those who make productive use of our vast national forests, in this case by enhancing and attracting the tourism upon which our mountain communities depend.\\" Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) accused the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power of being unnecessarily \\"adversarial\\" and having \\"unfairly vilified\\" the Forest Service after a committee hearing about the bill. The Public Lands Council and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association both supported the bill and urged supporters to contact their representatives and encourage them to vote in favor of the bill. The bill was opposed by groups likes the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the National Parks Conservation Association. Over 60 \\"conservation, sportsman, and recreation groups\\" opposed the bill. According to opponents, the bill is too broad. They believe the bill \\"could also block federal fisheries agencies like the United States Fish and Wildlife Service from requiring flows that help salmon find fish ladders and safely pass over dams.\\" American Whitewater opposed the bill, calling it a \\"sneak attack designed to force federal agencies to put private uses of river water ahead of other beneficial public uses like fish, wildlife, and recreation.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3189 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3189 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3189 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3189 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3189 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3189 Category:United States proposed federal environmental legislation Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Water resource management in the United States ","title":"Water Rights Protection Act"},{"id":"42176646","text":"The 2007–08 VMI Keydets basketball team represented the Virginia Military Institute during the 2007-08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

History  The castle is first recorded in 1213 as castro Weitersheim. In 1334 the counts of Sponheim (Lower County of Sponheim) sold the castle, which had meanwhile been renamed the Gutenburg. After the sale it underwent a major conversion. Following the extinction of the House of Sponheim (the Kreuzenach line died out in 1414 and the Starkenburg line in 1437) the castle went to the Lower Sponheim lords (mainly the Margraviate of Baden and Electoral Palatinate). The castle lost its importance over time, was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War and fell into ruins. In the copperplate by Daniel Meisner in the Thesaurus philopoliticus (published 1623f.) it is already portrayed as a ruin.  Present day  Today the castle ruins are in private ownership.  Layout  The castle consisted of an inner ward completely surrounded by a ring-shaped outer ward, protected by curtain walls with mural towers as well as a neck ditch.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The provisions in this bill that would pay for changes in the SGR formula by delaying some provisions of the Affordable Care Act were unpopular with Democrats, leading to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress), a bill that would simply delay the April 1, 2014 SGR Medicare cuts until March 2015. Background In the United States, Medicare is a national social insurance program, administered by the U.S. federal government since 1966, that guarantees access to health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system, younger people with disabilities, and a few other groups. As a social insurance program, Medicare spreads the financial risk associated with illness across society to protect everyone, and thus has a somewhat different social role from for-profit private insurers, which manage their risk portfolio by adjusting their pricing according to perceived risk. In 2010, Medicare provided health insurance to 48 million Americans—40 million people age 65 and older and eight million younger people with disabilities. It was the primary payer for an estimated 15.3 million inpatient stays in 2011, representing 47.2 percent ($182.7 billion) of total aggregate inpatient hospital costs in the United States.Torio CM, Andrews RM. National Inpatient Hospital Costs: The Most Expensive Conditions by Payer, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #160. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. August 2013. On average, Medicare covers about half (48 percent) of health care costs for enrollees. Medicare enrollees must cover the rest of the cost. These out-of-pocket costs vary depending on the amount of health care a Medicare enrollee needs. They might include uncovered services—such as long-term, dental, hearing, and vision care—and supplemental insurance.Kaiser Slides  The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Facts.kff.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-17. Over the last decade, Congress has been passing legislation to temporarily fix the Medicare payment system to avoid the major cuts that would otherwise go into effect due to existing law. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 would amend title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) end and remove sustainable growth rate (SGR) methodology from the determination of annual conversion factors in the formula for payment for physicians' services; (2) establish an update to the single conversion factor for 2014 through 2018 of 0.5%, (3) freeze the update to the single conversion factor at 0.00% for 2019 through 2023, and (4) establish an update of 1% for health professionals participating in alternative payment models (APMs) and an update of 0.5% for all other health professionals after 2023. The bill would direct the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to report to Congress on the relationship between: (1) physician and other health professional utilization and expenditures (and their rate of increase) of items and services for which Medicare payment is made, and (2) total utilization and expenditures (and their rate of increase) under Medicare parts A (Hospital Insurance), B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), and D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program). The bill would direct MEDPAC to report to Congress on: (1) the payment update for professional services applied under Medicare for 2014 through 2018, (2) the effect of such update on the efficiency, economy, and quality of care provided under such program, (3) the effect of such update on ensuring a sufficient number of providers to maintain access to care by Medicare beneficiaries, and (4) recommendations for any future payment updates for professional services under such program to ensure adequate access to care is maintained for Medicare beneficiaries. The bill would revise and consolidates components of the three specified existing performance incentive programs into a merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS) the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) is directed to establish, under which MIPS- eligible professionals (excluding most Alternative Payment Model [APM] participants) receive annual payment increases or decreases based on their performance. Applies the MIPS program to payments for items and services furnished on or after January 1, 2018. The bill would require specified incentive payments to be made to eligible partial qualifying APM participants. The bill would direct the Secretary to make available on the Physician Compare website of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) certain information, including information regarding the performance of MIPS-eligible professionals. The bill would require the Comptroller General (GAO) to evaluate the MIPS program. The bill would require GAO to submit to Congress a report that: (1) compares the similarities and differences in the use of quality measures under the original Medicare fee-for-service programs, the Medicare Advantage (MA) program under Medicare part C (Medicare+Choice), selected state Medicaid programs, and private payer arrangements; and (2) make recommendations on how to reduce the administrative burden involved in applying such quality measures. The bill would direct GAO to report to Congress on: (1) whether entities that pool financial risk for physician services can play a role in supporting physician practices in assuming financial risk for treatment of patients, and (2) the transition to an APM of professionals in rural areas, health professional shortage areas, or medically underserved areas. The bill would establish the Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the Secretary on physician- focused payment models. The bill would require the Secretary to study: (1) the application of federal fraud prevention laws related to APMs; (2) the effect of individuals' socioeconomic status on quality and resource use outcome measures for individuals under Medicare; and (3) the impact of risk factors, race, health literacy, limited English proficiency (LEP), and patient activation, on quality and resource use outcome measures under Medicare. The bill would direct the Secretary to: (1) post on the CMS Internet website a draft plan for the development of quality measures to assess professionals, (2) establish new Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for chronic care management services, and (3) conduct an education and outreach campaign to inform professionals who furnish items and services under Medicare part B and Medicare part B enrollees of the benefits of chronic care management services. The bill would authorize the Secretary to: (1) collect and use information on the resources directly or indirectly related to physicians' services in the determination of relative values under the Medicare physician fee schedule; and (2) establish or adjust practice expense relative values using cost, charge, or other data from suppliers or service providers. The bill would revise and expands factors for identification of potentially misvalued codes. Sets an annual target for relative value adjustments for misvalued services. Phases-in of significant relative value unit (RVU) reductions. The bill would direct GAO to study the processes used by the Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC) to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding relative values for specific services under the Medicare physician fee schedule. The bill would make Metropolitan Statistical Areas in California fee schedule areas for Medicare payments. The bill would direct the Secretary to: (1) establish a program to promote the use of appropriate use criteria for certain imaging services furnished by ordering professionals and furnishing professionals, and (2) make publicly available on the CMS Physician Compare website specified information with respect to eligible professionals. The bill would expand the kinds and uses of data available to qualified entities for quality improvement activities. The bill would direct the Secretary to provide Medicare data to qualified clinical data registries to facilitate quality improvement or patient safety. The bill would permit continuing automatic extensions of a Medicare physician and practitioner election to opt out of the Medicare physician payment system into private contracts. The bill would direct the Secretary to: (1) make publicly available through an appropriate publicly accessible website information on the number and characteristics of opt-out physicians and practitioners, and (2) report to Congress recommendations to amend existing fraud and abuse laws, through exceptions, safe harbors, or other narrowly targeted provisions, to permit gainsharing or similar arrangements between physicians and hospitals that improve care while reducing waste and increasing efficiency. The bill would declare it a national objective to achieve widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified electronic health record (EHR) technology nationwide by December 31, 2017, as a consequence of a significant federal investment in the implementation of health information technology through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR programs. The bill would direct the Secretary to study the feasibility of establishing mechanisms that includes aggregated results of surveys of meaningful EHR users on the functionality of certified EHR products to enable such users to compare directly the functionality and other features of such products. The bill would require GAO studies on the use of telehealth under federal programs and on remote patient monitoring services. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as introduced on February 6, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4015 would replace the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, which determines the annual updates to payment rates for physicians’ services in Medicare, with new systems for establishing those payment rates. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 4015 would increase direct spending by about $138 billion over the 2014-2024 period, as shown in the following table. This estimate is relative to the CBO’s February 2014 baseline projections of spending under current law. (The legislation would not affect federal revenues or spending subject to appropriation.) The costs of this legislation fall within budget functions 570 (Medicare) and 550 (health). Procedural history The SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 6, 2014 by Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-TX). It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, and the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On March 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 4015 would be considered on March 14, 2014. Debate and discussion The American Medical Association's president Ardis Dee Hoven argued strongly in favor of the bill, calling the current SGR \\"fiscally foolish\\" and \\"fatally-flawed.\\" According to Dr. Hoven, the costs associated with caring for seniors have risen 25 percent since 2001, but Medicare payments to doctors have not even increased 4 percent over the same time period. The Medicare portions of the bill had broad support and reflected a year's worth of debate and negotiation. However, House Republicans attached provisions to delay the individual mandate for five years to the bill, arguing that people should not have to buy insurance or pay a fine due to the wide variety of delays and exemptions that businesses had received. Delaying the individual mandated would also have the unexpected effect of saving the government money, since fewer people would sign up and would require fewer subsidies to pay for their insurance. The proposal to pay for the expensive change to the Medicare payment system by delaying the individual mandate was made by Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI). This action, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would save the government $170 billion. President Barack Obama announced his opposition to the bill and threatened to veto it. According to the Administration's statement, Obama favored the changes to Medicare but objected to the bill's inclusion of provisions that would delay the individual mandate from the Affordable Care Act by five years. Democrats, such as House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD), accused the Republicans of turning \\"bipartisan agreement into partisan confrontation.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress) *Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4015 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4015 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4015 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4015 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4015 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 4015 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014"},{"id":"42176759","text":"Zdeněk Hajný (30 January 1942 - 1 March 2014) was a Czech painter, graphic artist and psychologist.

This is a public domain source. S. 1086 would amend and reauthorize through fiscal year 2020 the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. Specifically, it would authorize the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of that program and add additional requirements to the program. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program was initially authorized through 2002 and has been authorized in annual appropriation acts since then. It is currently authorized through 2014 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (). Procedural history The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States Senate on June 3, 2013 by Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D, MD). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The committee reported the bill on February 25, 2014 with an amendment in the nature of a substitute alongside Senate Report 113-138. On March 13, 2014, the Senate voted in Recorded Vote 77 to pass the bill 96-2. Debate and discussion Senator Mikulski, who introduced the bill, argued that \\"this bill ensures that all children get the care they need and deserve.\\" Only one Senator, Mike Lee (R-UT), did not vote for the bill. Child Care Aware of America supported the bill, saying that it is \\"time to strengthen minimum protections for children,\\" which they believed the reauthorization and amendments would do. The organization supported having background checks on workers, requiring training basic CPR and health training, and holding unannounced inspections. Afterschool Alliance also supported the bill, saying \\"it is important to emphasize the value of quality school-age child care to achieve positive outcomes for children, including improved academic performance, work habits and study skills. On September 12, 2014, House and Senate leaders reached a bipartisan agreement to reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. Negotiated by Representatives John Kline (R-MN), George Miller (D-CA), Todd Rokita (R-IN), and David Loebsack (D-IA), and Senators Tom Harkin (D-IA), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), and Richard Burr (R-NC), the agreement will enhance transparency, strengthen health and safety protections, and improve the quality of care.
