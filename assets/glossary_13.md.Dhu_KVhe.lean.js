It was held the same day as another by-election in Fendalton. Background All three of the main political parties in New Zealand fielded candidates to contest the seat. At the time Petone was an electoral hive of activity with the local parliamentary seat becoming the third concurrent by-election in the area. There were also by-elections occurring for the local Maori seat, Southern Maori, following the death of Sir Eruera Tirikatene and the Petone mayoralty after Mayor Ralph Love was disqualified on a technicality. Candidates ;Labour Petone was a safe seat for Labour and therefore there were no shortage of nominees. At least 17 candidates came forward in the seat. The most prominent of whom were: *Fraser Colman, the Labour Party's assistant general secretary and former president of the Boilermakers' Federation. *John Jeffries, a lawyer and member of the Wellington City Council since 1962. *Rolland O'Regan, a Wellington City Councillor since 1965 and former chairman of the Citizens' All Black Tour Association.

Both Bill Fox (a former MP who had lost Miramar in an upset in 1966) and Gerald O'Brien (a Wellington City Councillor and chairman of the Wellington Labour Representation Committee) were approached to stand, but declined. Fox cited his desire to retire and already having arrangements to move to Otaki, whilst O'Brien indicated that the demands of running his business would be incompatible with a parliamentary candidature. Eventually Colman was selected to stand as Labour's candidate. ;National Richard Maunsell \\"Dick\\" Martin of Eastbourne was selected to contest the seat for the National Party. Martin had stood in Petone for National unsuccessfully in the 1960 general election where he had reduced Moohan's majority. ;Social Credit The Social Credit Party chose Colin James Whitmill, a civil servant working for the Ministry of Justice, as its candidate.

The Fremont Lake, located in Zec Frémont is formed in length by a bulge in the Flamand river. In this area the Flamand River drains a catchment area between the watershed of the Manouane River (north) and the watershed of the Vermillion River (south).

Then the Flamand river veers to the southeast to its mouth. It follows a serpentine path about 55 km to the south -west part of Reservoir Blanc. The latter is artificially formed by the Rapide-Blanc Generating Station, built on the Saint-Maurice River.

It was written by Lynott and Midge Ure, who was a temporary member of Thin Lizzy at the time, and who later went on to join Ultravox. It was subsequently remixed and released again on Lynott's second album, The Philip Lynott Album. The remixed version was used as the theme music to the British music chart television programme, Top of the Pops, from 1981 to 1986. Background \\"Yellow Pearl\\" originated during a Thin Lizzy tour of Japan in September 1979, during which time Midge Ure was playing keyboards in the band. He had initially been drafted in as a guitarist to replace Gary Moore who had left the band abruptly during a tour of the US. For the Japanese tour, Dave Flett was brought in to play guitar and Ure switched to keyboards. \\"I was never a keyboard player by any stretch of the imagination,\\" Ure admitted, but added that Lynott kept him in the band to add an extra dimension to the sound.Mark Putterford, \\"Philip Lynott: The Rocker\\", Castle, 1994 At rehearsals and soundchecks Ure would often play around with the riff to \\"Yellow Pearl\\", and Lynott remembered the tune when recording songs for Solo in Soho. He asked Ure to help him work the idea into a full song, around the same time as he was building a home studio, and Ure was introducing him to new developments in recording technology. Ure has said, \\"I actually have no idea what the song is really about, except perhaps that, as a thin outline, it's a comment on the thought of Japanese technology taking over – a twist on the Yellow Peril idea.\\" Lynott and Ure were also influenced by the new technology that they saw in Japan, such as the new Sony Walkman, and by a trip to see the Yellow Magic Orchestra. Regarding the lyrics, Ure was amused by Lynott attempting to make every word rhyme, commenting, \\"You'll hear that some of what he sings is complete nonsense, stuff that came off the top of his head and just happened to rhyme. It still makes me laugh today.\\" Release The song initially featured a female spoken-voice intro (\\"We all must beware of the Yellow Pearl\\"), and used a drum machine. This version was featured on Lynott's first solo album, Solo in Soho, released on 18 April 1980. On its first release as a single in the UK in March 1981, the song reached No. 56 in the British charts, and No. 25 in Ireland. =Top of the Pops= After the initial release of the single, Lynott recalled that he was approached by Top of the Pops producer Michael Hurll, who told Lynott that he liked \\"Yellow Pearl\\" and asked him to write new theme music for the programme. When asked what kind of song he wanted, Hurll replied, \\"Something like \\"Yellow Pearl\\",\\" and Lynott suggested simply using that song.Alan Byrne, \\"Philip Lynott: Renegade of Thin Lizzy\\", Mentor, 2012 After the remixed version was chosen as the Top of the Pops theme music in the summer of 1981, the remix was released as a single on 26 December, reaching No. 14 in the UK, and No. 13 in Ireland. It was accompanied by a video, costing around £20,000 and directed by Midge Ure, who appeared in silhouette in the video.Alan Byrne, \\"Thin Lizzy: Soldiers of Fortune\\", Firefly, 2004 The remix was over a minute shorter in length, dispensed with the spoken intro, and featured more prominent drums. The 12\\" single featured a longer remix, including the spoken intro, with drums by Rusty Egan. Lynott later said, \\"It has made me a fortune; every time I see Top of the Pops the cash register in me head starts ringing.\\" When pressed about the actual value of the royalties, he answered, \\"About 2p, I don't know. I wish I'd written the theme tune to Coronation Street.\\" Another version of the song was used as the chart rundown music between 1984 and 1986.

He was the only historically-known son of its fifth ruler Wang Yanxi (also known as Wang Xi, Emperor Jingzong).  Background  It is not known when Wang Yacheng was born. He was the only son of Wang Yanxi's whose existence was recorded in historical records. His mother was Lady Li, who, based on the sequence of the later events, likely was already married to Wang Yanxi before Wang Yanxi became Min's ruler. Lady Li's father was the official Li Zhen ().Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 94.  During Wang Yanxi's reign  In 939, Wang Yanxi became Min's ruler in a coup that saw the overthrow and death of his predecessor and nephew (Wang Yacheng's cousin) Wang Jipeng (also known as Wang Chang, Emperor Kangzong). He, changing his name to Wang Xi, claimed only the title of King of Min initially. In 941, he commissioned Wang Yacheng the commander of the imperial guards and chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Sometime thereafter, he created Wang Yacheng the Prince of Langye. Later in 941, he gave Wang Yacheng the title of military governor (Jiedushi) of Min's most important circuit, Weiwu Circuit (威武, headquartered at Min's capital Changle (), in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) and greater chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (); he also created Wang Yacheng the Prince of Changle.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Shortly after, Wang Xi claimed the title of emperor. In spring 942, he created Wang Yacheng's mother Lady Li empress, and created Wang Yacheng the Prince of Min.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. However, although Wang Xi was said to both favor and fear Empress Li, he later took the daughter of the general Shang Baoyin () as a concubine, and was said to favor her greatly on account of her beauty. Jealous of the favor that Consort Shang was receiving, Empress Li wanted to have Wang Xi assassinated so that Wang Yacheng could be emperor. Knowing that the imperial guard commanders Zhu Wenjin and Lian Chongyu were already having mutual suspicions with Wang Xi, she sent messengers to inform Zhu and Lian of Wang Xi's suspicions toward them. In summer 944, when Wang Yacheng's grandfather Li Zhen was ill, Wang Xi went to visit him, and Zhu and Lian took this opportunity to have him assassinated. They then slaughtered the imperial Wang clan,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. including Empress Li and Wang Yacheng.

Cameron, Colin P. Groves, p. 186, Elsevier Academic Press, 2004http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/3d-collection/ndutu Image at Smithsonian and early Homo sapiens, from the Middle Pleistocene, found at Lake Ndutu in northern Tanzania. Ndutu Fossil Replica.  Discovery  Lake Ndutu is a seasonal soda lake in the Serengeti, adjacent to Lake Masek and the Main Gorge at Olduvai. During September and October 1973, A. A. Mturi and the Tanzanian Department of Antiquities conducted an excavation of the exposed flats of the western shoreline of Lake Ndutu. The excavation site was approximately in area and had considerable amounts of lithic and faunal material on the surface; the Ndutu cranium was found on the first occupational floor of the site. Mturi’s excavation found 270 lithic and faunal materials in the first occupational floor of the excavation site, of which 20 were definitive tools. The tools were mainly spheroids and hammerstones, with six flakes (three regular flakes, two triangular, one rectangular). Mturi noticed the absence of Acheulean tools during his excavation, despite the cranial features of the skull being associated with the Acheulean industry. However, hand axes were later discovered during later visits to the site. According to Mturi, preliminary chronometric dating and racemization of bone found in the first occupational level has yielded a general age of 500,000 and 600,000 years. Other estimates based on the association of the Ndutu deposits with the Masek Beds at Olduvai suggest an age approaching 400,000 years.  Reconstruction and analysis  The Ndutu cranium was badly damaged and fragmented when it was found. The pieces of the skull were repaired and reconstructed by R.J. Clarke who made the initial description of it. According to Clarke, the Ndutu skull seemed to form a link between Homo erectus and archaic Homo sapiens, due to it having certain features in common with both. = Parts of skull remaining = The occipital was well preserved and almost completely intact. The temporals were damaged; the left temporal was more complete than the right temporal. The parietals were shattered; the majority of the right parietal was reconstructed, along with fragments of the left parietal. The frontal was mostly gone, a small piece of the right side above the brow ridge remained. The central region of the face includes much of the nasal aperture, part of the left nasal bone, part of the orbital rims with the lacrimal grooves, parts of the sphenoid, and much of the right orbital plate. Part of the right side of the face is preserved down to the infraorbital foramen, and on the left side there is a part that goes down to the palate, where the roots for the left canine, P3, P4, M1, and M2 are found. = Similarities to Homo erectus = The occipital has a well-developed nuchal torus that gives the skull an angulated lateral contour similar to Homo erectus. The mastoid process is small, and its posterior part is flat and lies in the nuchal plane, particularly similar to Olduvai hominids 9 and 12. The frontal bone has an almost vertical forehead, similar to Homo erectus, but unlike the Ngangdong or the Broken Hill crania. The walls of the frontal, occipital, parietals, and temporals, were very thick. = Similarities to Homo sapiens = The area of bone around the right parietal indicates parietal bossing. The sides of the braincase are more vertical when viewed from the back. The right tympanic plate has an ossified styloid process. There appears to be no sagittal torus. The supramastoid crest does not extend over the external acoustic meatus. G. Philip Rightmire stressed Ndutu's affinities to archaic H.sapiens and even proposed its allocation to a subspecies of H. sapiens.  Controversy  After Clarke’s analysis of the Ndutu skull, it was generally classified as Homo erectus. G. Philip Rightmire disagreed with this classification, and believed that its features suggested that it was more similar to the African fossils referred to as archaic Homo sapiens. According to Rightmire, the length and breadth dimensions of the Ndutu cranium are similar to earlier Homo erectus fossils from Koobi Fora and Illeret, while its size is more similar to OH 12 than OH 9. Based on the occipital morphology, mastoid shape, glenoid cavity, and tympanic plate of the Ndutu hominid, Rightmire claims that the fossil hominids it most resembles are Broken Hill, Elandsfontein, and other archaic Homo sapiens found in Africa. Chris Stringer classifies the cranium as belonging to Homo heidelbergensis/Homo rhodesiensis (a species considered to be intermediate between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens) rather than as early H. sapiens, but considers it to display a \\"more sapiens-like zygomaxillary morphology\\" than certain other examples of Homo rhodesiensis.

Life Margrethe von der Lühe was the daughter of count Christian Christopher Holck and Ermegaard Sophie von Winterfeldt and the sister of Conrad Holck, the favorite of king Christian VII of Denmark. She was inscribed in the Protestant convent Roskilde adelige Kloster in 1750. Margrethe von der Lühe served as lady-in-waiting to princess Louise of Denmark in 1766-68. She married baron Volrad August von der Lühe (1705-1778) in 1767. In 1768, she became overhofmesterinde (Mistress of the Robes) to queen Caroline Mathilde, after her predecessor Anne Sofie von Berckentin had been unable to serve because of Caroline Matilda's disapproval that her original mistress of the robes Louise von Plessen had been replaced without her consent. Despite her relation to the king's favorite Holck, who was disliked by the queen, she was liked by Caroline Matilda: they had often taken walks together in the countryside previously, and Caroline Matilda reportedly liked her humor. She was given the Ordre de l'Union Parfaite in 1768. In 1770, she was replaced in her post by Charlotte Elisabeth Henriette Holstein. In 1772, she was given the post of overhofmesterinde with the queen dowager Juliana Maria, the de facto regent at the time. She belonged to the influential figures of the regency regime of Juliane Marie alongside kammarfrue Sophie Hedevig Jacobi (married to the king's reader Chr. Fr.

Originally, the diocese included the city of Tambov as well as Kozlov and Borisoglebsk. In 1699, the diocese was closed and placed under the jurisdiction of the Ryazan diocese from 1720 - Voronezh diocese, and since 1723, the Moscow Synodal Office. Managing such a distant diocese through the Moscow Synod office was difficult, so again the question arose of placing a local bishop in charge. The Tambov and Rasskazovskaya Diocese was closed because the poor people of Tambov destroyed most of the facility. In 1758, by decree of Emperor of All Russia, Elizabeth, the diocese was restored. In addition to Tambov and Kozlov, the diocese included Dobry, Kerensky Narovchatov Upper and Lower Lomov and Troitsk. In 1764, the diocese added the city of Penza, Borisoglebsk, In SAR, Moksha. In 1779, the city added: Saransk, Morshansk, Kirsanov, Ranenburg, Serdobsk and Chembar. The final borders of the diocese were established in 1803. Since then, it has not come out of the administrative boundaries of the Tambov province, approved in 1796. At the end of 1930, no active parish operated in Tambov.

In Russia and Kazakhstan this tulip is a protected species.  Systematics  The species was first described in 1794 by Albrecht Wilhelm Roth in the \\"Annalen der Botanik\\" (ed. Usteri) 10, 44. as Tulipa suaveolens. The Latin ephithet suaveolens means sweet-smelling. Different species were described from different sites, which later turned out to be all members of the species Tulipa schrenckii. Tulipa schrenckii was described in 1873 by Eduard August von Regel in the Trudy Imperatorskago S.-Peterburgskago Botaničeskago Sada.2/2, 452 The ephiteton schrenkii honours the Baltic-German botanist Alexander Gustav von Schrenk.  History  The wild Tulipa suaveolens is known in Turkey as Kefe Lale (also \\"Cafe-Lale\\" after the medieval name of Kaffa on the Crimea). Sultan Selim II had 300.000 bulbs brought from Kefe for the gardens of the Topkapı-Sarajı in Istanbul. They are hybridized with other species present in the collections. These tulips hybrided were imported by Europeans starting from the 16th. century, particularly in Netherlands. They are at the origin of the garden tulip, Tulipa × gesneriana. Tulipa suaveolens is very narrowly related to Tulipa gesneriana, and sometimes classified in the same species. Tulipa suaveolens is also a progenitor of the low-growing Duc- tulips (also called Dukes, Dux or Ducks), which are attested in the Netherlands since the end of the 16th. century. They were named for Adrian Duyk from Oud-Karspel in the Netherlands. A painting by Jakob de Gheyn II., originating between 1600 and 1603 depicts shells, a caterpillar and a vase with love-in the mist, a snake's head fritillary, roses, Aquilegia, lilies-of the valley, pansies and a Tulipa schrenckii with pointed petals.

Background Pringle graduated in 1949 from Biloxi High School. He graduated in 1951, at the age of twenty, from the University of Mississippi at Oxford and in 1954 from the University of Mississippi School of Law. He practices law with the firm Pringle & Roemer in Biloxi, which specializes in Commercial Law, Domestic Relations, Estate Planning and Probate, General Practice, and Real Estate. Pringle has three children, a son, Dr. Charles K. Pringle, Jr. (born c. 1962), a radiologist in the Jackson area and a graduate of the University of Tennessee, as well as another son, Rives, and daughter, Caroline. Political life In 1963, at the age of thirty-two, Pringle ran for state representative in Biloxi on the Republican ticket headed by gubernatorial nominee Rubel Phillips of Corinth and Jackson, Mississippi and the candidate for lieutenant governor, Stanford Morse, an outgoing state senator and lawyer from Gulfport, the neighboring city of Biloxi on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Democratic Governor Ross Barnett was term-limited in the 1963 election. While Phillips and Morse, both former Democrats, were defeated by the Democrats Paul B. Johnson, Jr., and Carroll Gartin, respectively, Pringle won his state House race. In 1967, Paul Johnson was ineligible to seek reelection as governor, a provision that has since been changed in the Mississippi state constitution. Rubel Phillips again carried the Republican nomination for governor, but he was handily defeated by the Democrat U.S. Representative John Bell Williams of Mississippi's 3rd congressional district. By this time, Clarke Reed of Greenville had replaced the original chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party, Wirt Yerger, an insurance agent in Jackson, under whom Pringle had been elected to the House. Pringle lost his House seat after a single term, as did two other freshmen Republican members of the legislature, Representative Lewis Leslie McAllister, Jr., a businessman from Meridian and later, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, who served from 1962 to 1968, and State Senator Seelig Wise, who represented Coahoma, Tunica, and Quitman counties near Clarksdale in northwestern Mississippi from 1963 to 1968.Billy Hathorn, \\"Challenging the Status Quo: Rubel Lex Phillips and the Mississippi Republican Party (1963-1967)\\", The Journal of Mississippi History XLVII, November 1985, No. 4, p. 240, 242, 262.

Trudy of Gradient Lair, a womanist blog about black women and art, media, social media, socio-politics and culture, has also been credited in developing the lexical definition of the term. The concept is grounded in the theory of intersectionality, which analyzes how various social identities such as race, gender, class, and sexual orientation interrelate in systems of oppression. Development Bailey coined the term misogynoir in 2010 while she was a graduate student at Emory University. She first used it on the Crunk Feminist Collective blog to discuss misogyny toward black women in hip hop music. Misogynoir combines misogyny and noir to describe anti-black sexism faced by black women. Bailey considered other terms, such as sistagyny, before settling on misogynoir. The media connotation of noir factored into Bailey's decision. In 2013, an article by Bailey on misogynoir and gender oppression in hip-hop was published in Souls: A Critical Journal of Black Politics, Culture, and Society. The concept of misogynoir has been accepted and used as a term by many black feminists and cultural critics, especially in the blogosphere. In a foreword to Michele Wallace's book Black Macho and the Myth of the Superwoman, Jamilah Lemieux wrote that misogynoir \\"can come even from those who are black, who were raised by black women and profess to value black people.\\" In an article in the Albany Law Review, authors Aimee Wodda and Vanessa R. Panfil write that trans women of color experience violence at a greater rate than other populations. This transmisogyny towards black people has been characterized as \\"transmisogynoir\\". The term transmisogynoir was created to refer to the intersection between transmisogyny and misogynoir, meaning the oppression of black trans women. Transmisogynoir encomposes transphobia, misogyny, and antiblackness. It was coined by Trudy of Gradient Lair. Application Though misogynoir can be perpetrated by anyone, the term most often refers to the misogyny experienced by Black women at the hands of Black men. As the plight of the Black man in America remains at the forefront of society, Black feminist work as well as the issues similarly facing African American women are erased and ignored. The Black Lives Matter movement, created in 2012, was founded by three Black women: Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrisse Cullors. The fact that women started the movement is little known throughout the wider community and while the movement specifically states it advocates for the lives of the entire black community, protests and activists groups invoking the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag and mission are disproportionately rallying cries for justice on behalf of African American men. Incidences where police wrongfully kill or assault Black women (as well as transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming Black people) receive significantly less attention, as evidenced by the lack of media attention surrounding the 2015 case of Officer Daniel Holtzclaw who used his authority to prey on and assault upwards of 13 Black womenhttps://www.apnews.com/2a7be40a2aa5447f907b3d6ad338a572https://www.theguardian.com/us- news/2016/mar/08/daniel-holtzclaw-lawsuit-sexual-assault-complaint-police- cover-up. On a broader scale, misogynoir is also characterized by the tropes projected onto Black women. Some of these common stereotypes include the \\"Strong Black Woman\\" and the hyper-sexual \\"Jezebel\\". In her article \\"4 Tired Tropes That Perfectly Explain What Misogynoir Is – And How You Can Stop It\\", Kisiena Boom describes these common tropes and why they are damaging.4 Tired Tropes That Perfectly Explain What Misogynoir Is – And How You Can Stop It For example, while the \\"Strong Black Woman\\" stereotype seems to be complimentary, it ignores the racialized physical and mental trauma that Black women have had to endure. Perpetuating the idea that Black women can handle anything justifies the situations African American women are forced into, such as the \\"Mammy\\" role for white families, the heteronormative head of household when Black men are lost to the prison-industrial complex, and sexual abuse. This justification eliminates the need and desire to rectify the real problems. Furthermore, this trope forces Black women to bury their issues and put on a \\"strong\\" face for all of those who expect it. Some further applications of misogynoir can be assessed through the use of unfair and unjust assumptions of women, particularly women of color, is the practice of doctors, or other physicians, refusing certain safe practices to Black women because they are believed to possess higher pain tolerance.\\"Feminist Facts: What is Misogynoir?\\", VERVE TEAM September 4, 2018 In music Misogynoir has been cited by scholars to address Black sexual politics in hip hop music and culture at large. Respectability politics is one such issue. Coined by Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, respectability politics refers to the tactics black people employ to promote racial uplift and obtain broader access to the public sphere. Misogynoir is shown in the lyrics and in the videos that are released to promote popular songs and better publicize certain songs. In recent years it was found that music had more sexual content than any other media outlet. In hip-hop music black women are often depicted as only being good for abuse or sex. These videos and lyrics reflect the way society sees black women and their bodies. Music videos are important because they are a way to better publicize hit songs especially on television. Television shows became significant because they aired music video. Examples of these are BET, MTV, and VH1.

One where measurement happens first, and one where an operation conditioned on the to-be-measured qubit happens first. The Deferred Measurement Principle is a result in quantum computing which states that delaying measurements until the end of a quantum computation doesn't affect the probability distribution of outcomes. A consequence of the deferred measurement principle is that measuring commutes with conditioning. The choice of whether to measure a qubit before, after, or during an operation conditioned on that qubit will have no observable effect on a circuit's final expected results. Thanks to the deferred measurement principle, measurements in a quantum circuit can often be shifted around so they happen at better times. For example, measuring qubits as early as possible can reduce the maximum number of simultaneously stored qubits; potentially enabling an algorithm to be run on a smaller quantum computer or to be simulated more efficiently. Alternatively, deferring all measurements until the end of circuits allows them to be analyzed using only pure states.

It aired on Fox in the United States on April 27, 2014. Plot Bob and Linda take the kids to Dr. Yap's office for a dental checkup. Louise learns that she has a cavity, but is too afraid to get the necessary filling. She flees out the window (ordering Dr. Yap, who is intimidated by her, to wait ten minutes before alerting her parents of her departure). Bob and Linda are horrified when they discover their 9-year-old daughter is nowhere to be found, but Bob reasons that Louise will have no choice but to come home soon. With no options for housing available, Louise reluctantly takes a bus to Aunt Gayle's drab studio apartment, planning to hide out until further notice. Gayle calls Linda, alerting her to Louise's whereabouts. Bob and Linda know that Louise will never voluntarily agree to the filling, so \\"creative parenting\\" will be necessary to lure her back. To help with the plan, they send Tina and Gene to stay with Aunt Gayle as well. Linda then presents Louise with a wager: if she can make it through the weekend without being driven crazy by Gayle's neurotic behavior, she will not have to get the filling. If she cracks, she must comply. Louise confidently agrees to the bet, unaware that her sister Tina is acting as her parents' \\"inside man,\\" communicating with them via text message. Linda texts Tina instructions on how to unleash Gayle's odd behavior. The kids are forced to replace the decorative claw caps on Gayle's three ill-tempered cats, listen to her excruciating poetry, and play her completely senseless homemade board game, \\"Gayle Force Winds.\\" Louise begins to get irritated, but refuses to give up. With one day left before Louise technically wins the bet, Bob and Linda plan a stakeout outside Gayle's apartment. They are joined by an uninvited Teddy, who keeps them awake with his snoring. To their dismay, Louise makes it through the night without surrendering, and they employ their last resort: Linda texts Tina, asking her to give Louise ice cream for breakfast. Louise accepts, but the ice cream upsets her cavity and causes intense pain. Bob, Linda, and Teddy enter the apartment to pick up the kids, and Louise admits to Gayle that she is frightened of the dentist. To everyone's surprise, Gayle concocts an ingenious plan to turn Louise's fear \\"into make-believe.\\" Louise trusts her, and agrees to return to Dr. Yap's office. Louise's filling appointment has been set up like the ending of an action movie. Gayle escorts Louise, the \\"asset,\\" through the dentist's office, preceded by Gene and Tina acting as bodyguards. Dr. Yap, aware of the setup, plays along and tells Louise that the fate of the universe rests with her, and that she must get the filling in order to save the world. Bob, Linda, and Teddy arrive as the \\"enemies,\\" firing invisible weapons around the exam room as Louise bravely allows Dr. Yap to repair her tooth. Afterwards, Bob marvels that Gayle actually possesses some impressive parenting skills. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying “The Kids Run Away” isn’t quite the show firing on all cylinders, but it’s a consistently funny half-hour of television. As Gayle, Megan Mullally finds some nice tones to play beyond just crazy cat lady; I particularly liked Gayle’s palpable anger with the pound that has until now refused to give her that fourth cat. Tina proves a natural man-on-the-inside because she’s so perfectly unconvincing; anyone else might sound stilted when leading Gayle into the next insane activity, but that’s just how Tina always sounds. But the real comedic stars of this episode are Bob and Linda, even as they remain on the sidelines. Without the kids around to keep them busy, the pair pass the time riffing about parenting books—something Linda is convinced is not actually a thing—and having impromptu sex; it’s a nice affirmation of just how much Bob and Linda really do love each other, even if they’re usually too exhausted by life to notice it.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10, saying \\"I’ve probably said this already in my reviews, but Bob’s Burgers really does work best when there’s just one plot thread for all the characters to work off from. The little tendrils that feed off of it make for some great color and weird bits of humor, like Teddy’s suggestion that when Bob and Linda stake out Gail’s apartment they get some food (“Get some steak! It’ll be a takeout steak stakeout!”), but it follows the through line without getting distracted by a second plot or other incidentals. And if it involves Gail’s ridiculous poetry, all the better. \\" The episode received a 1.1 rating and was watched by a total of 2.26 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to American Dad!, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 4.02 million.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Stettler, Alberta. After the war she was converted to a and served until 1966. Stettler was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942–1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 31 May 1943 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec and launched 9 October later that year. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 7 May 1944 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti- submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up in Bermuda, Stettler returned to Halifax where she was assigned to local escort group EG 16. She remained with the group when it transferred to Londonderry Port in March 1945. She escorted convoys to and from Gibraltar twice, otherwise remaining on patrol in the waters around the United Kingdom. In June 1945, Stettler returned to Canada from Europe, the last Canadian warship to do so. Upon her return she began a tropicalization refit at Shelburne for possible service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant adding refrigeration and water-cooling capabilities and changing the camouflage. The refit was cancelled in August 1945 due to the surrender of Japan. Stettler was paid off 9 November 1945 and laid up. =Postwar service= After the war, Stettler was sold to private interests. However she was taken over in 1952 by the Royal Canadian Navy when they decided to refit old River-class frigates. She underwent conversion to a Prestonian-class frigate as part of the need to expand the anti-submarine force within the navy. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti-submarine mortars. and was recommissioned 27 February 1954 at Halifax, Nova Scotia with the new pennant number 311. She transferred to the west coast and on 1 January 1955, the frigate was assigned to the Second Canadian Escort Squadron of Pacific Command. In November 1955, the Second Canadian Escort Squadron was among the Canadian units that took part in one of the largest naval exercises since the Second World War off the coast of California. In January 1960, Stettler and three other Prestonian-class ships made a tour of South American ports, visiting San Diego, Balboa, the Galapagos Islands, Callao and Valparaíso, Talara and Long Beach. Stettler was a member of the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron based out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. In June 1960 the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron performed a training tour of the Pacific, with stops at Yokohama, Japan, Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor. They returned to Canada in August. The frigate remained in service there until 31 August 1966 when she was paid off. She was sold to Capital Iron & Metals Ltd. of Victoria, British Columbia and scrapped there in 1967.

It was one of the first Noisette roses, and over time has been called by a multitude of names, including Rosa × noisettiana, 'Rosier de Philippe Noisette', 'Noisette de l'Inde, 'Blush Cluster', or 'Noisette Carnée' (French for Flesh-coloured Noisette). According to the RHS Encyclopedia of Roses, the cultivar is mostly called 'Blush Noisette' in America, and otherwise known as 'Noisette Carnée'. 'Blush Noisette' arose as a seedling from the light pink rose hybrid 'Champney's Pink Cluster', introduced by Champneys around 1811 (synonym 'Champneyana'), and was the first frost-hardy climber flowering repeatedly, giving the cultivar importance as a parent rose. 'Blush Noisette' flower and buds The dainty, cupped, semi-double to double flowers appear solitary and in tight clusters on long, smooth stems. They have a diameter of up to with up to 35 petals. Their colour changes from crimson buds to pale lilac pink and fades to pinkish white in mature petals. 'Blush Noisette' is described to have a characteristic clove-like fragrance varying in strength. The flowers appear continuously throughout the season, that can span the entire year in warmer regions. The vigorous plant is a small climber or a tall shrub rose, reaching 1.5 to 2.5 meters height (5' to 8') at a width of 1.5 m (5'), but needs a few years to grow to its final height, as the cultivars puts more energy into its many flowers. As a climber, the cultivar can be trained to reach heights of up to . The dense shrub has long arching shoots with a reddish colour, very few prickles, and many soft, glossy leaves. The foliage is medium to dark grey green with crimson veins. 'Blush Noisette' tolerates half shade, is disease resistant and heat tolerant, but not hardy in severe winters (USDA zone 7) and the flowers are easily damaged by rain. It can be grown solitary, in dense hedges, or with some support be trained as a climber and is well suited for obelisk trellises.

It is approximately 29 km long and has its source on the flanks of Plynlimon and has its confluence with the Severn in Llanidloes. The annual rainfall over the catchment is between 1737 mm and 1836 mm. River regulation A large part of the upper catchment of the river is inundated by the Clywedog reservoir which stores water from the catchment, especially during the winter months, and releases it during periods of low flow to support the flow in the Severn so that drinking water may be abstracted downstream. The management rules also enable the reservoir to maintain the reservoir below maximum level during the winter so that there is capacity to absorb flood flows to reduce the impact of flooding further down the main river.Hydrology in Practice. Shaw E The Afon Clywedog thus has a highly regulated flow with relatively high flow in dry conditions and reduced flow in wetter weather.

The episode was written by Elisabeth R. Finch and Holly Brix and directed by Joshua Butler. Plot The episode starts with Tyler (Michael Trevino) waking up on the Traveler's camp where he finds himself chained up. Maria (Tamara Austin), Julian's wife, the traveler who is inside his body, is with him and kisses him believing that he is Julian. Tyler pretends to be him so he can find out what is going on and when he hears Maria saying that Markos (Raffi Barsoumian) found a way to remove the magic from Mystic Falls and he is now on the search for the doppelgangers, he shifts and runs to the Salvatore house to tell them Markos' plan. At the Salvatore house, Damon (Ian Somerhalder) tries to locate where Enzo (Michael Malarkey) is with the help of Luke (Chris Brochu) but Luke cannot find him. Stefan (Paul Wesley) joins them and tries to convince Damon to stop looking for Enzo because the reason Luke cannot find him is probably because Enzo does not want to be found. Tyler interrupts them to tell them Markos' plans and that he is after the doppelgangers as they speak, so Damon and Stefan decide to go with Elena (Nina Dobrev), Caroline (Candice Accola) and Luke at a place where Luke will cloak them with a spell and Markos will not be able to find them. The four of them along with Luke go to Caroline's father's cabin in the woods to hide. Luke works on the spell while Caroline sees Elena and Stefan acting weird and she thinks that they two of them are back together and want to hide it but the thing they are hiding is Enzo's death. Caroline, plans a game night where she hopes to make them admit they are back together, and Damon agrees since he can also see the way they act and he also believes they hide something but not a romantic relationship. At the same time, Enzo's ghost is at the cabin and wants to make sure that Damon will find out about his death. In the meantime, Bonnie (Kat Graham) and Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) try to have a romantic weekend just the two of them, but Jeremy gets a text from Matt (Zach Roerig) and they have to go home. Jeremy leaves and Bonnie's grandmother, Sheila (Jasmine Guy) appears to her to warn her that she has to tell Jeremy the truth about the Other Side falling apart and not giving him hope that she will find a way to stay alive. While they talk, Sheila knocks over a lamp something that as a ghost should not be able to do. The games at the Forbes' cabin start and Damon suggests to play \\"Never Have I Ever\\" where Caroline takes the opportunity to \\"ask\\" if Elena and Stefan are back together while Damon asks about where Enzo really is. Things get awkward, Stefan does not answer the question and keeps saying that he did not lie about Enzo, while Elena prefers to leave and go take a bath. Enzo follows her and when she gets into the tub, he pushes her under the water. Elena tries to get on top and at the brief moment she does, she manages to shout out to Damon who rushes into the bathroom but cannot see anyone. Elena tells him that someone was pushing her under the water but could not see anyone. Damon believes that is the ghost of Caroline's father but cannot understand why he would try to hurt Elena and Elena finally tells him the truth about Enzo. In the meantime, Stefan calls Bonnie to ask if people from the other side can interact with the real world and Bonnie tells him about Sheila. Caroline overhears their conversation and she also knows now that Enzo is dead. They all try to figure out why Enzo would try to drown Elena since something like that would not work and they realize that this was just a distraction. They rush outside to find Luke but Luke is gone and that means he is no longer protects them with the clogging spell and travelers can find them. They split up to find Luke and then leave the cabin. Caroline and Damon are mad at Elena and Stefan respectively for not telling them about Enzo. Stefan and Damon find Luke tied up in the barn and they try to untie him when Enzo sets the barn on fire and stakes Stefan in the back. Then he does the same to Damon and wants to keep them there so they will burn. Stefan manages to remove the stake and Damon forces him to take Luke and get out of the burning barn, while he tries to convince Enzo that he will find a way to bring him back to life since they did it in the past with Jeremy and Bonnie. Enzo frees him and Damon gets out before he gets burn. Meanwhile, Matt, Tyler and Jeremy want to find out where Markos is and the only way is to ask the traveler who is inside Tyler body. They tied Tyler up and call Julian. Julian takes over but he does not want to tell them anything. He changes his mind when Matt and Jeremy start to torture him and he tells them that he does not know where Markos is but he knows that Markos does not like troubles so he will probably go on to make him permanent on Tyler's body. The only way to prevent that is for Jeremy and Matt to go and get Julian's body from where the travelers hide their bodies when they possess others. Jeremy and Bonnie go to where Julian told them and start to be searching for Julian's body among the others. While they are searching, Maria appears with other travelers and they get Julian's body leaving Jeremy and Bonnie to go back home without it. They try to explain Tyler what happened when he starts seeing things and being in pain. At the same time, the travelers burn Julian's body and chant, indicating that they started the spell for making Julian permanent on Tyler's body. Julian takes over again saying: \\"I assume you did not find my body\\" while everyone looks at him terrified to the idea that Tyler is gone for ever. The episode ends at the Forbes cabin, where Damon, Stefan, Elena, Caroline and Luke prepare to leave but the travelers have already found where they are and they manage to capture Elena and Stefan.

Ashley Dominique of Geeked Out Nation gave the episode an A- rating. \\"In \\"What Lies Beneath\\" our crew did everything they possibly could to rival against the travelers, while dealing with Enzo's ghost doing it's best to kill them all.\\" Stephanie Flasher from TV After Dark gave the episode a B+ rating saying: \\"Overall, this episode was quite entertaining. It had a nice story that was amusing yet had an climatic build up to keep the audience engaged.\\" LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating. \\"There are a couple of things TVD can do that will make me forget all of my worries about the show. When the show goes back to its horror roots, it’s easy to momentarily forget all the bad that has been going on. Also, put any of these characters in cabin, and I’m predisposed to not hate the episode. Luckily, “What Lies Beneath” does both these things and is a better episode for it.\\" Matt Richenthall from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.4/5. \\"This outing did a solid job furthering Caroline's obvious crush on Stefan; evolving Damon as someone worthy of being loved; and scaring the crap out of anyone who enjoys a good ghost story.\\" Richenthal also commented on the villain Markos and the Travelers stating that they are boring: \\"A series such as TVD needs a strong villain - and Markos is a complete snooze. He has no personality. He hasn't done anything remotely frightening. He's simply existing in the show's universe and saying he wants his people to have a home.\\" Caroline Preece of Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode saying that the show is built in secrets. \\"This week’s episode was an episode that addressed these secrets and, as a handy by-product, actually provided some relief to the audience.\\" Preece also comments on the love triangle between Stefan, Elena and Damon and the possibility of something new to start between Stefan and Caroline: \\"I admire the show’s restraint with [the love triangle], having another pairing develop over multiple seasons while we were all distracted with the ‘epic-ness’ of the central trio’s dysfunction. I like it, and look forward to seeing it play out.\\" Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews gave a positive review to the episode saying that there was nothing particularly wrong with it. \\"The most interesting parts of this episode were the emotional beats. Elena and Stefan seem to have a solid friendship in the works, which is a nice change from the awkwardness of months past.

Tim & Eric's Bedtime Stories was created by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim of the comedy duo Tim & Eric, who have been working with the network for several years with various shows and projects. The pilot episode aired on October 31, 2013, and the series officially premiered on September 18, 2014. Production According to the network, the series would mark a stylistic departure from the duo's previous Adult Swim show, Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, instead being formatted as an anthology series. Initial reports indicated that the series would have a quarter-hour running time. Reviewers, the network and Heidecker have commented that the series is inspired by The Twilight Zone, with the latter stating they will explore \\"different genres and different tropes\\" in the anthology format. The series' pilot aired midnight, October 31, 2013, as a Halloween special. According to Heidecker, the pilot was produced in the same year that it aired, and the show had not been produced yet, waiting to start production toward the end of the year. On May 7, 2015, two new half-hour episodes were announced to be in production. They aired in the fall of 2015. On June 16, 2016 Tim Heidecker announced in an interview that Season 2, consisting of at least six full 30 minute episodes, would be aired in 2017. Season 2 premiered on September 10, 2017. On October 3, 2018, Heidecker implied on Twitter that a third season was unlikely. As of January 2020, there has been no announcement of a third season.

It premiered on May 4, 2014 on Fox, and aired on May 5, 2014 on National Geographic Channel. The episode was directed by Brannon Braga, written by Ann Druyan and Steven Soter, and featured the voice of Amanda Seyfried as geologist Marie Tharp. The episode explores the history of the Earth starting with the period of the Late Heavy Bombardment, approximately \\"3.8 to 4.1 Billion years ago during which the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and the Earth were battered by space debris.\\" Host Neil deGrasse Tyson then delves into the biography of the Earth, expressed \\"in its continents, oceans and life living on and in them, saying 'the past is another planet,'\\" alluding to how plate tectonics have shaped the Earth over millions of years. The episode received a 1.6/5 in the 18-49 rating/share, with 4.08 million American viewers watching on Fox.  Episode summary  A map of Earth's plate tectonics This episode explores the palaeogeography of Earth over millions of years, and its impact on the development of life on the planet. Tyson starts by explaining that the lignin-rich trees evolved in the Carboniferous era about 300 million years ago, were not edible by species at the time and would instead fall over and become carbon-dioxide-rich coal. Some 50 million years later, near the end of the Permian period, volcanic activity would burn the carbonaceous matter, releasing the carbon dioxide and acidic components, creating a sudden greenhouse gas effect that warmed the oceans and released methane from the ocean beds, all leading towards the Permian–Triassic extinction event, killing 90% of the species on Earth. Tyson then explains on the nature of plate tectonics that would shape the landmasses of the world. Tyson explains how scientists like Abraham Ortelius hypothesized the idea that land masses may have been connected in the past, Alfred Wegener who hypothesized the idea of a super-continent Pangaea and continental drift despite the prevailing idea of flooded land-bridges at the time, and Bruce C. Heezen and Marie Tharp who discovered the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that supported the theory of plate tectonics. Tyson describes how the landmasses of the Earth lay atop the mantle, which moves due to the motion and heat of the Earth's outer and inner core. Tyson moves on to explain the asteroid impact that initiated the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, leaving small mammals as the dominate species on Earth. Tyson proceeds to describe more recent geologic events such as the formation of the Mediterranean Sea due to the breaking of the natural dam at the Strait of Gibraltar, and how the geologic formation of the Isthmus of Panama broke the free flow of the Atlantic Ocean into the Pacific, causing large-scale climate change such as turning the bulk of Africa from lush grasslands into arid plains and further influencing tree-climbing mammals' evolution towards walking long distances on two legs and using tools. Tyson further explains how the influence of other planets in the Solar System have small effects on the Earth's spin and tilt, creating the various ice ages, and how these changes influenced early human's nomadic behavior. Tyson explains that the climate then stabilized to become the current interglacial period, and finally that this stable period risks to be prematurely ended by the human activity of burning fossil fuels, which will threaten our environment and our ability to feed ourselves. Tyson concludes the episode by noting how Earth's landmasses are expected to change in the future, and postulates what may be the next great extinction event, and that there is a chance that our story will end with it.  Reception  The episode's premiere on Fox brought a 1.6/5 in the 18-49 rating/share, with an audience of 4.08 million American viewers. It placed fourth and last in its timeslot behind The Good Wife, Resurrection, and Believe; and thirteenth out of seventeenth for the night.

Franklin (4 May 1889 – 21 April 1941) was an American cinema chain executive who later moved into production of stage shows and films. He co- produced the musical comedy Revenge with Music (1934). He produced the 1940 melodrama parody film The Villain Still Pursued Her. Life Harold B. Franklin was born in New York City, New York, on 4 April 1889. He started his career as a vaudeville booking agent. In 1914 he became a theater manager. =Cinema executive= Franklin joined Adolph Zukor's Famous Players-Lasky and became vice-president of Publix Theatres. At the start of 1928 the Fox Film Corporation bought West Coast Theaters (Wesco), with over 232 houses. Franklin continued in charge of Wesco, based in Los Angeles. Dynamite, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, premiered on 25 July 1929 at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles. The next day Franklin wrote to DeMille asking him to cut almost forty minutes from the 129-minute film so that when it went into general release the smaller houses could get more daily screenings. DeMille said he would try, but the longer version is the one that has survived. In 1930 Franklin lobbied against Daylight Saving, which he said cut 10% to 30% of gross theater sales. Industries involved in outdoor activities such as sports and barbecues were in favor of Daylight saving. On 6 April 1930 Harley L. Clarke was elected president of Fox Films and Fox Theaters, replacing William Fox. Clarke wanted more control over the Fox West Coast Theater chain, which Franklin had been running without much interference. After six months he offered Franklin a contract buy-out, which he accepted. Franklin then became president of Hughes Franklin Theatres. In 1932 RKO had a management shake-up driven by David Sarnoff, chairman of the board and president of RKO's parent, RCA. Franklin became president of the theater division, Keith-Albee-Orpheum. Franklin reorganized the division and eliminated twenty-eight unprofitable theaters, but gross revenues declined due to lack of good pictures and a general downturn in cinema attendance. Franklin was transferred to become president of the RKO circuit. =Producer= In 1933 Franklin left RKO and joined up with Archibald Selwyn to form Frankwyn Productions, a stage production company. He also became president of Standard Theatres. Continental Varieties, a vaudeville review co-produced Selwyn and Franklin, opened at the Little Theatre on 3 October 1934 and ran for 77 performances. Yip Harburg wrote the lyrics. Franklin's independent production company filmed Gambling in August–September 1934 at the ESSI studio in Astoria, Queens, directed by Rowland V. Lee. The picture was adapted from a 1929 stage melodrama written by George M. Cohan, in which he also starred. Cohan was again the star of the film. The film was a failure, described as \\"a stodgy adaptation of a definitely dated play directed in obsolete theatrical technique. Franklin briefly worked for Columbia in 1935. He managed the \\"Motion Pictures' Greatest Year\\" campaign in 1938. In 1940 Franklin's independent film company Franklin- Blank released The Villain Still Pursued Her, which was distributed by RKO. The script by Elbert Franklin was based on the play The Fallen Saved. The film is a parody of Victorian melodramas, described as \\"more silly than funny\\". Buster Keaton introduced some genuinely humorous moments. The film was a flop when it was released, but still has some fans. Franklin died in Mexico City, Mexico, on 21 April 1941.

Political life In 1963, at the age of thirty, McAllister, who then resided in Meridian, won a special election in Lauderdale County to fill a vacancy in the Mississippi House. He hence became the first member of his party to serve in the Mississippi legislature in the 20th century. McAllister sought a full term in 1963 on the Republican ticket headed by gubernatorial nominee Rubel Phillips of Corinth and Jackson, Mississippi and the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor, Stanford Morse, an outgoing state senator and lawyer from Gulfport on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Democratic Governor Ross Barnett was term-limited in the 1963 election. Thirty Republicans ran for legislative seats, a record number for the fledgling party. Phillips and Morse, both former Democrats, were defeated by the Democrats Paul B. Johnson, Jr., and Carroll Gartin, respectively; McAllister won a full term in his state House race. In 1966, McAllister was the Republican nominee for Mississippi's 4th congressional district seat vacated after one term by Prentiss Walker, who instead challenged without success the reelection of U.S. Senator James O. Eastland. McAllister lost to Gillespie V. Montgomery, who held the Meridian- based House seat for thirty years. In 1967, Paul Johnson was ineligible to seek reelection as governor, a provision that has since been changed in the Mississippi state constitution. Rubel Phillips again carried the Republican nomination for governor, but he was handily defeated by the Democrat U.S. Representative John Bell Williams of Mississippi's 3rd congressional district. By this time, Clarke Reed of Greenville had replaced the original chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party, Wirt Yerger, an insurance agent in Jackson, under whose leadership McAllister had been first elected to the House. One Republican leader told Time magazine that the 1967 results had probably halted GOP inroads in Mississippi by perhaps fifteen years. Yet the party won two seats in the United States House of Representatives in 1972. McAllister was unseated though he carried the Meridian-section of his district prior to reapportionment. Two other freshmen Republican legislators were defeated, Representative Charles K. Pringle, a lawyer from Biloxi, and State Senator Seelig Wise, a cotton and soybean farmer who represented Coahoma, Tunica, and Quitman counties near Clarksdale in northwestern Mississippi.Billy Hathorn, \\"Challenging the Status Quo: Rubel Lex Phillips and the Mississippi Republican Party (1963-1967)\\", The Journal of Mississippi History XLVII, November 1985, No. 4, pp. 240, 242, 258, 262.

In actuality, Chapdelaine died from physical abuse in prison, and was beheaded after death. Lingchi (), translated variously as the slow process, the lingering death, or slow slicing, and also known as death by a thousand cuts, was a form of torture and execution used in China from roughly 900 CE until it was banned in 1905. It was also used in Vietnam. In this form of execution, a knife was used to methodically remove portions of the body over an extended period of time, eventually resulting in death. Lingchi was reserved for crimes viewed as especially heinous, such as treason. Some Westerners were executed in this manner. Even after the practice was outlawed, the concept itself has still appeared across many types of media.  Etymology  The term lingchi first appeared in a line in Chapter 28 of the third-century philosophical text Xunzi. The line originally described the difficulty in travelling in a horse- drawn carriage on mountainous terrain. Later on, it was used to describe the prolonging of a person's agony when the person is being killed. Description The process involved tying the condemned prisoner to a wooden frame, usually in a public place. The flesh was then cut from the body in multiple slices in a process that was not specified in detail in Chinese law, and therefore most likely varied. The punishment worked on three levels: as a form of public humiliation, as a slow and lingering death, and as a punishment after death. According to the Confucian principle of filial piety, to alter one's body or to cut the body are considered unfilial practices. Lingchi therefore contravenes the demands of filial piety. In addition, to be cut to pieces meant that the body of the victim would not be \\"whole\\" in spiritual life after death. This method of execution became a fixture in the image of China among some Westerners.. Lingchi could be used for the torture and execution of a living person, or applied as an act of humiliation after death. It was meted out for major offences such as high treason, mass murder, patricide/matricide or the murder of one's master or employer. Emperors used it to threaten people and sometimes ordered it for minor offences.Hongwu Emperor. 大誥 [Letters Patent]文秉 [Wen Bing]. 先撥志始 [Volume One of the History] There were forced convictions and wrongful executions.王世貞 [Shizhen (1526–90)]. 弇山堂别集 [Yanshan Hall Collection], vol. 97劉若愚 [Liu Ruoyu (1584–?)]. 酌中志 [Discretion in Chi], vol. 2 Some emperors meted out this punishment to the family members of their enemies. While it is difficult to obtain accurate details of how the executions took place, they generally consisted of cuts to the arms, legs, and chest leading to amputation of limbs, followed by decapitation or a stab to the heart. If the crime was less serious or the executioner merciful, the first cut would be to the throat causing death; subsequent cuts served solely to dismember the corpse. Art historian James Elkins argues that extant photos of the execution clearly show that the \\"death by division\\" (as it was termed by German criminologist Robert Heindl) involved some degree of dismemberment while the subject was living.Elkins, James, The Object Stares Back: On the Nature of Seeing, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996 Elkins also argues that, contrary to the apocryphal version of \\"death by a thousand cuts\\", the actual process could not have lasted long. The condemned individual is not likely to have remained conscious and aware (if even alive) after one or two severe wounds, so the entire process could not have included more than a \\"few dozen\\" wounds.

As an official punishment, death by slicing may also have involved slicing the bones, cremation, and scattering of the deceased's ashes. Western perceptions The Western perception of lingchi has often differed considerably from the actual practice, and some misconceptions persist to the present. The distinction between the sensationalised Western myth and the Chinese reality was noted by Westerners as early as 1895. That year, Australian traveller George Ernest Morrison, who claimed to have witnessed an execution by slicing, wrote that \\"lingchi [was] commonly, and quite wrongly, translated as 'death by slicing into 10,000 pieces' – a truly awful description of a punishment whose cruelty has been extraordinarily misrepresented ... The mutilation is ghastly and excites our horror as an example of barbarian cruelty; but it is not cruel, and need not excite our horror, since the mutilation is done, not before death, but after.\\" According to apocryphal lore, lingchi began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes and genitals before proceeding to cuts that removed large portions of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders. The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public. Some victims were reportedly given doses of opium to alleviate suffering. John Morris Roberts, in Twentieth Century: The History of the World, 1901 to 2000 (2000), writes \\"the traditional punishment of death by slicing ... became part of the western image of Chinese backwardness as the 'death of a thousand cuts'.\\" Roberts then notes that slicing \\"was ordered, in fact, for K'ang Yu-Wei, a man termed the 'Rousseau of China', and a major advocate of intellectual and government reform in the 1890s\\".Roberts, p. 60, footnote 8. Although officially outlawed by the government of the Qing dynasty in 1905, lingchi became a widespread Western symbol of the Chinese penal system from the 1910s on, and in Zhao Erfeng's administration. Three sets of photographs shot by French soldiers in 1904–05 were the basis for later mythification. The abolition was immediately enforced, and definite: no official sentences of lingchi were performed in China after April 1905. Regarding the use of opium, as related in the introduction to Morrison's book, Meyrick Hewlett insisted that \\"most Chinese people sentenced to death were given large quantities of opium before execution, and Morrison avers that a charitable person would be permitted to push opium into the mouth of someone dying in agony, thus hastening the moment of decease.\\" At the very least, such tales were deemed credible to British officials in China and other Western observers. History Execution of Joseph Marchand in Vietnam, 1835. Lingchi existed under the earliest emperors, although similar but less cruel tortures were often prescribed instead. Under the reign of Qin Er Shi, the second emperor of the Qin dynasty, multiple tortures were used to punish officials. The arbitrary, cruel, and short-lived Liu Ziye was apt to kill innocent officials by lingchi. Gao Yang killed only six people by this method, and An Lushan killed only one man. Lingchi was known in the Five Dynasties period (907–960 CE); but, in one of the earliest such acts, Shi Jingtang abolished it. Other rulers continued to use it. The method was prescribed in the Liao dynasty law codes, and was sometimes used. Emperor Tianzuo often executed people in this way during his rule. It became more widely used in the Song dynasty under Emperor Renzong and Emperor Shenzong. Another early proposal for abolishing lingchi was submitted by Lu You (1125–1210) in a memorandum to the imperial court of the Southern Song dynasty. Lu You there stated, \\"When the muscles of the flesh are already taken away, the breath of life is not yet cut off, liver and heart are still connected, seeing and hearing still exist. It affects the harmony of nature, it is injurious to a benevolent government, and does not befit a generation of wise men.\\" Lu You's elaborate argument against lingchi was piously copied and transmitted by generations of scholars, among them influential jurists of all dynasties, until the late Qing dynasty reformist Shen Jiaben (1840–1913) included it in his 1905 memorandum that obtained the abolition. This anti- lingchi trend coincided with a more general attitude opposed to \\"cruel and unusual\\" punishments (such as the exposure of the head) that the Tang dynasty had not included in the canonic table of the Five Punishments, which defined the legal ways of punishing crime. Hence the abolitionist trend is deeply ingrained in the Chinese legal tradition, rather than being purely derived from Western influences. Under later emperors, lingchi was reserved for only the most heinous acts, such as treason,清华大学教授刘书林——中国第一汉奸曾国藩 a charge often dubious or false, as exemplified by the deaths of Liu Jin, a Ming dynasty eunuch, and Yuan Chonghuan, a Ming dynasty general. In 1542, lingchi was inflicted on a group of palace women who had attempted to assassinate the Jiajing Emperor, along with his favourite concubine, Consort Duan. The bodies of the women were then displayed in public. Reports from Qing dynasty jurists such as Shen Jiaben show that executioners' customs varied, as the regular way to perform this penalty was not specified in detail in the penal code. Lingchi was also known in Vietnam, notably being used as the method of execution of the French missionary Joseph Marchand, in 1835, as part of the repression following the unsuccessful Lê Văn Khôi revolt. An 1858 account by Harper's Weekly claimed the martyr Auguste Chapdelaine was killed by lingchi; in reality he was beaten to death. As Western countries moved to abolish similar punishments, some Westerners began to focus attention on the methods of execution used in China. As early as 1866, the time when Britain itself moved to abolish its own cruel method of hanging, drawing, and quartering, Thomas Francis Wade, then serving with the British diplomatic mission in China, unsuccessfully urged the abolition of lingchi. Lingchi remained in the Qing dynasty's code of laws for persons convicted of high treason and other serious crimes, but the punishment was abolished as a result of the 1905 revision of the Chinese penal code by Shen Jiaben.Shen, Jiaben.

Norman was a widely travelled writer and photographer whose collection is now owned by the University of Cambridge. Norman gives an eyewitness account of various physical punishments and tortures inflicted in a magistrate's court (yamen) and of the execution by beheading of 15 men. He gives the following graphic account of a lingchi execution but does not claim to have witnessed such an execution himself. \\"[The executioner] grasping handfuls from the fleshy parts of the body such as the thighs and breasts slices them away ... the limbs are cut off piecemeal at the wrists and ankles, the elbows and knees, shoulders and hips. Finally the condemned is stabbed to the heart and the head is cut off.\\"Turandot: Chinese Torture/Supplice chinois. CNRS. Retrieved 20 May 2012. * George Ernest Morrison, An Australian in China (1895) differs from some other reports in stating that most lingchi mutilations are in fact made post- mortem. Morrison wrote his description based on an account related by a claimed eyewitness: \\"The prisoner is tied to a rude cross: he is invariably deeply under the influence of opium. The executioner, standing before him, with a sharp sword makes two quick incisions above the eyebrows, and draws down the portion of skin over each eye, then he makes two more quick incisions across the breast, and in the next moment he pierces the heart, and death is instantaneous. Then he cuts the body in pieces; and the degradation consists in the fragmentary shape in which the prisoner has to appear in heaven.\\" * Tienstin (Tianjin), The China Year Book (1927), p. 1401, contains contemporary reports from fighting in Guangzhou (Canton) between the Nanjing government and Communist forces. Stories of various atrocities are related, including accounts of lingchi. There is no mention of opium, and these cases appear to be government propaganda. * The Times, (9 December 1927), a journalist reported from the city of Guangzhou (Canton) that the Communists were targeting Christian priests and that \\"It was announced that Father Wong was to be publicly executed by the slicing process.\\" * George de Roerich, \\"Trails to Inmost Asia\\" (1931), p . 119, relates the story of the assassination of Yang Tseng-hsin, Governor of Sinkiang in July 1928, by the bodyguard of his foreign minister Fan Yao-han. Fan was seized, and he and his daughter were both executed by lingchi, the minister forced to watch his daughter's execution first. Roerich was not an eyewitness to this event, having already returned to India by the date of the execution. * George Ryley Scott, History of Torture (1940) claims that many were executed this way by the Chinese Communist insurgents; he cites claims made by the Nanking government in 1927. It is perhaps uncertain whether these claims were anti-communist propaganda. Scott also uses the term \\"the slicing process\\" and differentiates between the different types of execution in different parts of the country. There is no mention of opium. Riley's book contains a picture of a sliced corpse (with no mark to the heart) that was killed in Guangzhou (Canton) in 1927. It gives no indication of whether the slicing was done post-mortem. Scott claims it was common for the relatives of the condemned to bribe the executioner to kill the condemned before the slicing procedure began. =Photographs= Lingchi execution in Beijing April 1905, apparently of Fou-Tchou-Li The first Western photographs of lingchi were taken in 1890 by William Arthur Curtis of Kentucky in Guangzhou (Canton). French soldiers stationed in Beijing had the opportunity to photograph three different lingchi executions in 1904 and 1905: * Wang Weiqin (王維勤), a former official who killed two families, executed on 31 October 1904. * Unknown, reason unknown, possibly a young deranged boy who killed his mother, and was executed in January 1905. Photographs were published in various volumes of Georges Dumas' Nouveau traité de psychologie, 8 vols., Paris, 1930–43, and again nominally by Bataille (in fact by Lo Duca), who mistakenly appended abstracts of Fou-tchou-li's executions as related by Carpeaux (see below). * Fou-tchou-li or Fuzhuli (符珠哩),Turandot: Chinese Torture/Supplice chinois.

Carpeaux's narrative was mistakenly, but persistently, associated with photographs published by Dumas and Bataille. Even related to the correct set of photos, Carpeaux's narrative is highly dubious; for instance, an examination of the Chinese judicial archives show that Carpeaux bluntly invented the execution decree. The proclamation is reported to state: \\"The Mongolian princes demand that the aforesaid Fou-Tchou-Le, guilty of the murder of Prince Ao-Han-Ouan, be burned alive, but the Emperor finds this torture too cruel and condemns Fou-Tchou-Li to slow death by leng-tch-e (different spelling of lingchi, cutting into pieces).\\" In popular culture Accounts of lingchi or the extant photographs have inspired or referenced in numerous artistic, literary, and cinematic media. Some works have attempted to put the process in a historical context; others, possibly due to the scarcity of detailed historical information, have attempted to extrapolate the details or present innovations of method that may be products of an author's creative license. Some of these descriptions may have influenced modern public perceptions of the historic practice. =Non- fiction= Susan Sontag mentions the 1905 case in Regarding the Pain of Others (2003). One reviewer wrote that though Sontag includes no photographs in her book – a volume about photography – \\"she does tantalisingly describe a photograph that obsessed the philosopher Georges Bataille, in which a Chinese criminal, while being chopped up and slowly flayed by executioners, rolls his eyes heavenwards in transcendent bliss.\\" The philosopher Georges Bataille wrote about lingchi in L'expérience intérieure (1943) and in Le coupable (1944). He included five pictures in his The Tears of Eros (1961; translated into English and published by City Lights in 1989).. Historians Timothy Brook, Jérome Bourgon and Gregory Blue, criticised Bataille for his language, mistakes and dubious content... =Literature= The \\"death by a thousand cuts\\" with reference to China is also mentioned in Malcolm Bosse's novel The Examination, Amy Tan's novel The Joy Luck Club, and Robert van Gulik's Judge Dee novels. The 1905 photos are mentioned in Thomas Harris' novel Hannibal and in Julio Cortázar's novel Hopscotch. It is also a main plot element in D. B. Weiss's 2003 novel Lucky Wander Boy. In Gary Jennings's novel The Journeyer, this form of execution plays a role, including an extreme version of it where the condemned is sustained by being fed their own flesh as it is removed. =Film= A scene of Lingchi appeared in the 1966 film The Sand Pebbles. Inspired by the 1905 photos, Chinese artist Chen Chieh-jen created a 25-minute, 2002 video called Lingchi – Echoes of a Historical Photograph, which has generated some controversy. Lingchi is a method of execution in the 2014 TV series The 100. Lingchi was portrayed in the 2015 Netflix-exclusive TV series Jessica Jones. The method of Lingchi was described in the 2018 TV series Orange is the New Black. =Music= One of the tracks in Taylor Swift’s seventh studio album is entitled “Death By A Thousand Cuts” and compares the pain of a breakup to this form of torture.

The song first appeared in Crüger's hymnal in 1653. The text addresses Jesus as joy and support, versus enemies and the vanity of existence. The poetry is bar form, with irregular lines from 5 to 8 syllables. The melody repeats the first line as the last, framing each of the six stanzas. Several English translations have been made of the hymn, including Catherine Winkworth's \\"Jesu, priceless treasure\\" in 1869, and it has appeared in around 40 hymnals. There have been choral and organ settings of the hymn by many composers, including by Johann Sebastian Bach in a motet, BWV 227, for unaccompanied chorus, and a chorale prelude, BWV 610, for organ. In the modern German Protestant hymnal, Evangelisches Gesangbuch, it is No. 396.Materialien / Jesu, meine Freude (EG: 396) (in German) reformation-und-musik.de  Text  The text is presented in six stanzas of nine lines each. It is in bar form; three lines form the Stollen, three the Abgesang, with the meter 6.6.5.6.6.5.7.8.6. The last line of the last stanza repeats the first line of the first stanza. The song is written in the first person, addressing Jesus. The theme of turning away from the world and to Jesus made the hymn suitable for funerals, seen as the ultimate turning away from the world: # Jesu, meine Freude (Jesus, my joy) # Unter deinem Schirmen (Beneath your protection) # Trotz dem alten Drachen (I defy the old dragon) # Weg mit allen Schätzen (Away with all treasures) # Gute Nacht, o Wesen (Good night, existence) # Weicht, ihr Trauergeister (Go away, mournful spirits) The first stanza sets the theme of love to Jesus and the desire to be united with him, who is named Lamb, as in , and Bridegroom, based on . It is a parody of the love song \\"Flora, meine Freude\\", published in 1645 by Heinrich Albert, organist at the Königsberg Cathedral. The second stanza describes the protection of Jesus against threats by Satan, enemies, thunder, hell and sin, all pictured in drastic images. The third stanza repeats three times Trotz (defiance), facing the enemies \\"old dragon\\" (alter Drachen), death (Tod), and fear (Furcht). The believer, feeling safe even in adverse conditions as expressed in , stands and sings (Ich steh hier und singe). The fourth stanza turns away from worldly treasures and honours, which should not separate the believer from Jesus. The fifth stanza repeats four times \\"Gute Nacht\\" (Good night), to existence in the world, to sins, to pride and pomp, and to a life of vice. The last stanza imagines the entry of Jesus as the \\"Freudenmeister\\" (master of joys), as a comforter in every misery. It alludes to Jesus entering after the resurrection ().  Hymn tune and settings  The tablature score of Buxtehude's cantata BuxWV 60 The hymn tune, Zahn 8032, in E minor culminates in the long phrase of line 8 and repeats line 1 in line 9, framing the stanza. One of the earliest choral settings is a cantata (BuxWV 60) by Dieterich Buxtehude composed in the 1680s. David Pohle set it for four voices, three instruments and continuo. The hymn is the basis for Bach's motet of the same name, BWV 227. Scored for five vocal parts—two sopranos (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)—Bach alternates the stanzas of the chorale and text from Paul's epistle to the Romans. Within an overall symmetrical structure, he varies his treatment of the verses of the hymn: stanzas 1 and 6 (transcribed below) are the same simple four part setting; stanzas 2 and 4 are settings with the cantus firmus in the soprano and an expressive accompaniment in the lower three or four voices; stanza 5 is a chorale fantasia with the cantus firmus in the alto; and stanza 3 is based on a free paraphrase of the hymn tune. << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\relative c'' \\\\repeat unfold 2 { << { b4 b a g  fis2 e\\\\fermata  b'4 cis d b  e2 dis\\\\fermata  e8 fis g4 fis4. fis8  e1\\\\fermata \\\\bar \\"\\" }  { g,4 fis e8 dis e4  e( dis) b2  g'8 fis e4 d! d  g8( a b4) b2  g8 a b4 b4. a8  g1 } >> } \\\\relative c'' << { b4 b c b  a4. a8 g2\\\\fermata  b4 cis d b  e d8 cis cis2  b2\\\\fermata b4 b  a g8 fis fis2  e1\\\\fermata \\\\bar\\".\\" }  { g4 g a g  g fis d2  g4 g a g8 a  b4 b b( ais)  fis2 g4 fis  e e e( dis)  b1 } >> } ew Lyrics \\\\lyricmode { \\\\set stanza = #\\"1.\\" Je4 -- su, mei -- ne Freu2 -- de, mei4 -- nes Her -- zens Wei2 -- de, Je4 -- su, mei -- ne Zier!1 ach,4 wie lang, ach lan2 -- ge, ist4 dem Her -- zen ban2 -- ge, und4 ver -- langt nach dir!1 Got4 -- tes Lamm, mein Bräu -- ti -- gam,2 au4 -- ßer dir soll mir auf Er2 -- den nichts4 sonst Lie -- bers wer2 -- den. } ew Lyrics \\\\lyricmode { \\\\set stanza = #\\"6.\\" Weicht,4 ihr Trau -- er -- gei2 -- ster, denn4 mein Freu -- den -- mei2 -- ster, Je4 -- sus, tritt her -- ein.1 De4 -- nen, die Gott lie2 -- ben, muß4 auch ihr Be -- trü2 -- ben lau4 -- ter Zu -- cker sein.1 Duld'4 ich schon hier Spott und Hohn,2 den4 -- noch bleibst du auch im Lei2 -- de, Je4 -- su, mei -- ne Freu2 -- de. } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key e \\\\minor \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\relative c' \\\\repeat unfold 2 { << { e4 b c8 fis, g4  c( b8 a) g2  e'8[ d] cis[ b] a4 g8 a  b4( g') fis2  e4 e e dis  b1 }  { e,4 d c4. b8  a4( b) e2  e4 a8 g fis4 g8 fis  e( fis g a) b2  c4 b8 a b4 b,  e1 } >> } \\\\relative c' << { e4 d d d  e d8 c b2  d4 e d d  g fis g( fis8 e )  dis2 e4 fis8( g)  a a, b4 c( b8 a)  gis1 }  { e8 fis g4 fis g  c, d g,2  g'4 fis8 e fis4 g8 fis  e4 b e( fis)  b,2 e4 d  c b a( b)  e1 } >> } >> >> \\\\layout { indent = #0 } \\\\midi { \\\\tempo 4 = 60 } Bach also used the tune as a cantus firmus, played by a trumpet, in an aria of his cantata Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 (1714). He closed Sehet, welch eine Liebe hat uns der Vater erzeiget, BWV 64, a Christmas cantata of 1723, with the fifth stanza, and his 1724 cantata Jesus schläft, was soll ich hoffen? BWV 81, with the second stanza. The closing chorale of cantata Bisher habt ihr nichts gebeten in meinem Namen, BWV 87, (1725) is a stanza from a hymn by Heinrich Müller on the same tune. Bach set the hymn for organ in BWV 610, one of the chorale preludes in his Orgelbüchlein. Other Baroque composers who have composed chorale preludes on the hymn tune include Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow, Johann Gottfried Walther and George Frederic Handel (HWV 480). Later chorale preludes included a work by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg, while Johann Gottfried Müthel wrote variations in D minor on the tune. Johann Gottfried Muethel (1728-1788) / Complete Fantasies / Choral Preludes aeolus-music.com Max Reger composed a prelude as No. 21 of his 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67 in 1902. Preludes were also written by Sigfrid Karg-Elert (Op. 87, No. 2), Reinhard Schwarz-Schilling (1927), Karl Höller (Op. 22, 1936), Joseph Ahrens (1942) and Max Drischner (1945). Günther Marks composed in 1970 a partita for viola and organ on the tune. In 2005, Gerhard Präsent arranged Bach's chorale prelude for string quartet, in Three Choral Preludes and Aria by Johann Sebastian Bach, completed and arranged for string quartet, also in a version for string trio. Steven Sametz composed a Fantasia on \\"Jesu, meine Freude\\" for SATB choir and digitally delayed treble instrument in 2009.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 4, 2014. Plot Tina decides to try out for the cheerleading squad, but it's actually Gene who gets noticed in the crowd while cheering her on. Mr. Ambrose, the school librarian, serves as the cheerleading advisor, but hates cheerleading, because he wanted to be the drama club advisor instead. Therefore, he pushes the cheerleaders into trope-laden rivalries in order to \\"inject drama\\" into the club, exacerbating the already existing rivalry between Gene as the talented newcomer and squad captain, Todd, as the out- dated veteran leader. Ambrose continues to encourage their rivalry, resulting in a \\"cheer off\\" which Gene easily wins, becoming the new captain. Linda is delighted that Gene has become a cheerleader, vicariously living out her own failed cheerleading aspirations (particularly a memory of a high school friend named Monica who became a cheerleader and ditched her) through him with cheerleading-themed packed lunches and inane cheering routine ideas. As the new squad captain, the pressure begins to get to Gene, until Linda's incessant cheerleader talk causes him to snap and tell her that she'll never be a cheerleader and that her ideas, including an impossible cartwheeling human tower, are terrible. Linda is furious and refuses to encourage him any further. Meanwhile, after falling and biting her tongue during her audition, Tina is unable to speak. Louise steps up to be her translator, and manages to get her a date with Jimmy Jr. Louise uses Tina's inability to speak to take advantage of Jimmy Jr., masquerading her interests as Tina's. She negotiates an expensive date at the revolving restaurant Pie In The Sky, where she orders their enormous pie sampler, eating until she vomits. She goes too far and Tina manages to communicate to Jimmy Jr. what her perfect date would have been, which Jimmy Jr. reveals is exactly what he would have wanted as well. The two kiss. Continuing his attempts to heighten the \\"drama\\" in the club, Ambrose informs the squad that he entered them into the regional cheerleading finals and that the squad must develop a completely new winning routine in a single night all by themselves. Gene proposes a routine using robot costumes and a futuristic theme. However, on the day of the competition they discover that Ambrose leaked their routine to their rivals to force them into the \\"dramatic\\" twist of needing to come up with a last minute routine and still win. Linda reluctantly attends the competition with Bob, and to her surprise, sees Monica in the audience. She confronts Monica, only to learn that Monica does not remember her and went on to become a successful cheerleader and nice person. Meanwhile, with no options left, Gene proposes that the team use Linda's cartwheeling human tower. Recognizing the inherent danger of the routine, especially to the person at the base of the tower, Gene volunteers to be the base. Todd refuses to allow him to do so, telling him that despite their differences, he respects Gene's charisma and passion. The two reconcile. As the squad takes on the routine, Linda is delighted to see that Gene used her idea, but it becomes clear that the tower is about to predictably collapse. Ambrose runs to cushion the squad's fall, saving them from danger, claiming that he did so to fulfill the dramatic twist of the \\"jaded advisor with a heart of gold.\\" Linda and Gene reconcile and Linda proposes a new impossibly dangerous routine for the squad to Bob's protests. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, saying \\"Gene It On\\" is one of this season's weakest episodes, though that's not such a horrible thing given this year's generally high quality. And, whatever the narrative problems of its main story, this episode does strike some gold with its subplot, in which Louise volunteers to be an injured Tina's highly unreliable interpreter. At its first glance, this story is just as dumb as the episode's central plotline, but it benefits from the presence of more familiar characters. That includes Mr. Frond, who gets in a very funny cameo as someone who totally fails to grasp what an injured tongue actually means; he's a particularly good character to include in a plot like this, as voice actor David Herman's years on Futurama have made him an expert at selling more surreal gags.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.7 out of 10, saying \\"The tale of Gene, the trumped-up drama between him and Todd, and the big cheerleading competition that closes out the show almost seem anti-climactic with everything that happens before it. But the strange hints about Gene’s sexual preferences that get dropped in the mix (Todd: “You deserve the top. I’ll be the bottom”), and their failed stunt that lands them in a heap atop Mr. Ambrose, sure make for a great conclusion to one of Season Four's best episodes.\\" The episode received a 1.1 rating and was watched by a total of 2.23 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to American Dad!, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 4.40 million.

Writers created a long running \\"love triangle\\" story between the characters which culminated in Owen being unfaithful and choosing to be with Chrissie. Diane has also been featured in the special episode, \\"Tuesday's Child\\", which sees Diane travel to Ghana to convince Ric to return to Holby City hospital. Potter, Quarshie and the show's crew travelled to the Ghanaian city of Elmina, where they filmed the episode in sweltering heat. Writers also put Diane's career into jeopardy following two patient deaths which were investigated by the hospital board. The first being Dominic Fryer (Simon Dutton), who had previously sexually assaulted Diane. The second was a patient who died following a surgical error made by Nick Jordan (Michael French). Diane covers for him and is suspended for three months. Potter decided to leave Holby City in 2007 and producers killed Diane off. She becomes down on her luck, quits her job and commits suicide by stopping her car on the railway track just as a train was passing. Her final appearance was in the episode titled \\"Past Imperfect\\", which was broadcast on 3 July 2007. In 2019, Potter agreed to reprise the role for a special episode to celebrate the show’s 20th anniversary. Diane appears as a vision when Ric Griffin goes into cardiac arrest during brain surgery to remove a benign tumour. The character proved popular with television critics who chose her stories in their \\"pick of the day\\" features. Andrea Mullaney from The Scotsman named Diane of the show's best characters. The People's Sarah Moolla hailed her one of Holby City's \\"strongest and most likeable characters\\". Casting The character and Potter's casting were publicised in June 2002. A reporter from Inside Soap revealed that Diane would arrive at Holby City hospital to work as a registrar. They added that she is an ex-lover of the established character Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) and the last time they had seen each other, Ric had asked her to marry him. Of her casting, Potter said \\"it's a fantastic cast and crew, and everyone's really good friends.\\" She made her first appearance in the episode titled \\"High Risk\\", which was broadcast on 2 July 2002. Development =Characterisation= A reporter from BBC Online said that \\"Diane was an ambitious woman determined to succeed in the male- dominated world of surgery. She was also a fragile, highly-strung soul unable to express her emotions well.\\" Writers have portrayed Diane being very serious about her concentrating on her career and she is determined to prove herself in the hospital. A writer from What's on TV has described her medical skill set as being on par with the male doctors. She is ambitious and her dedication to the role annoys other staff - but she is not afraid to have fun. The character has often been portrayed as keen to find love with various failed relationships. Potter said that Diane \\"tries so hard to be professional all the time\\" but this often leaves her \\"wound up and emotional\\". When Diane reaches her thirtieth birthday, she decides that she should try and settle down. But Potter warned that \\"she doesn't know how to handle relationships very well.\\" The actress also believed she was \\"much older and wiser\\" than the unlucky-in-love Diane. =Failed relationships= Noah Huntley played surgeon Will Curtis. He shared a romantic connection with Diane but Holby City writers did not develop it further.Writers paired Diane with healthcare assistant Danny Shaughnessy (Jeremy Edwards) soon after her introduction. He creates problems between them by bragging to midwife Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White) that Diane will do whatever he asks of her. Diane overhears the exchange and is upset, which Danny worsens by flirting with a patient. Writers carried on creating more arguments between Diane and Danny. When the hospital staff accuse a relative, Matt Bradshaw (Dominic Rickhards) of domestically abusing his wife, he directs his anger towards Diane and hits her. Danny fails to remain professional and attacks Matt. Diane is angry with Danny's violent outburst and questions whether she wants to continue their relationship. Their romance ends just weeks later when she catches Danny and Lisa having sex. Producers then paired Diane with charge nurse Steve Waring (Peter de Jersey) for her second relationship story. Diane thinks she is pregnant and goes to registrar Mubbs Hussein (Ian Aspinall) for an ultrasound scan to confirm it. Diane's reaction is to ask for a termination and she is upset so decides to confide in Ric. He informs his daughter Jess Griffin (Verona Joseph) who has previously had an abortion and she offers Diane advice. She then goes ahead with the termination. In July 2003, Potter said that it was her favourite storyline because it allowed the chance to portray Diane's differing personality. She described Steve's departure as \\"terribly sad\\" with \\"the added trauma of the abortion\\", which showed her \\"vulnerability - she's usually very strong - and I enjoyed having a good cry.\\" Diane is included in a storyline which helps introduce the surgeon Will Curtis (Noah Huntley). His debut episode takes place at an army base which was filmed on location at woodlands in Watford. There were ten night shoots in cold weather and snow. Potter enjoyed the experience because it was funny to film and added that she looked \\"foul in combats\\". Diane and Will share some close moments but Potter warned that he turns out to be unsuitable for Diane. In the episode, which is titled \\"In The Line of Fire\\", Diane goes to a field hospital where she trains Will on trauma techniques. A soldier dies while an participating in an exchange of friendly fire. This has a negative effect on their day but they agree that they work well together. Diane then thinks she will not see Will again so asks him out on a date. She is disappointed when he declines the offer. But the pair do have an \\"obvious attraction\\" to each other. Will arrives at Holby City hospital to take a job as a registrar. Diane is surprised to see him and realises that their attraction was not real. Huntley told Claire Brand from Inside Soap that \\"the spark between them isn't so obvious when they meet again.\\" Diane's stories often feature consultant Ric Griffin and Potter enjoyed working with Quarshie on a regular basis. When Diane was introduced into the show it was revealed she is Ric's ex-girlfriend. The actress told a reporter from BBC Online that \\"I'd love Diane and Ric to end up as a bickering old married couple.\\" Ric and Diane would have an on-off relationship lasting her entire duration of the show. The pair rekindle their romance during a trip to Ghana (see below). In March 2007, producers ended their partnership for good. Ric returns following an extended break from the hospital, which causes Diane to talk about him. She states that Ric has never inspired her which Ric overhears. Quarshie told a reporter from Metro that \\"it’s not exactly the welcome he was expecting.\\" So Ric decides to get revenge by introducing Diane to his new fiancée Thandie Abebe (Ginny Holder), knowing that the former still loves him. Quarshie added that \\"Diane tries to apologise for her outburst, but she meets Thandie and is speechless.\\" This exchange is \\"the final nail in the coffin\\" for their on-off relationship. =Marriage to Owen Davis= Diane's relationship with consultant obstetrician Owen Davis (Mark Moraghan) began in 2005. Potter initially thought that Diane and Owen were well suited to each other. She told Alex Tate from The People that explained \\"Owen is the real Lothario type who isn't too keen on commitment and Diane backs off when any relationship gets serious, so they work quite well together.\\" When Diane's pregnant sister Joanna Lloyd (Hannah Bourne) is involved in a car accident she is rushed to hospital. Diane is angry because Joanna did not wear her seatbelt while driving and accuses her of being a bad mother. Following their argument Joanna's condition deteriorates and she is taken into intensive care. When she is rushed into an operating theater, surgeons fail to save Joanna but they do manage to deliver her baby Jack safely. Joanna's ex-boyfriend Simon Parker (Stuart Laing) tells Diane that he does not want to look after Jack and he is now Diane's responsibility. She is shocked and has to consider her career commitments. Diane decides to take care of the baby. Potter said that this forces Diane and Owen to \\"reassess everything\\" because she feels that she cannot concentrate on him too. This leaves Owen with the task of convincing her otherwise. Potter concluded \\"she's got to juggle being a surgeon and a mum, so it's up to Owen whether he wants a ready-made family.\\" Diane finds it difficult to carry on working and look after Jack. Her boss Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) begins to pressurise her into progressing faster in her hospital role and put her career first. Writers began to include Owen's ex- wife, ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley) in the story. As Nicola Methven and Polly Hudson from the Daily Mirror noted, Owen and Chrissie had a five-year relationship with constant reconciliation. Chrissie is jealous when she notices that Owen is investing his time in Diane and Jack's life. When Owen offers Diane parenting advice, she tells him to mind his own business. But she soon reconsiders when Simon issues a court summons wanting to regain custody of Jack. Diane struggles with the possibility of losing Jack. She tells Owen that they must spend more time with Jack, prior to the hearing. This prompts Owen to change his priorities, asking Diane to marry him and move into his home. She accepts and Chrissie is angry that Owen has set up a home with Diane and baby Jack. She feels more upset because their baby died. Moraghan told an Inside Soap reporter that \\"Owen does love Diane and he is just desperate to have a family and settle down.\\" Other characters make comparisons between Owen's relationships with both Diane and Chrissie, believing he is replacing his deceased child. But Moraghan believed that Owen thinks that his relationship with Chrissie was over for good. Chrissie does not think the same and begins to romantically pursue Owen. Moraghan explained that Chrissie is \\"funny like that\\" and \\"wants what she cannot have\\". He concluded that Owen wants Diane but warned that she \\"is always going to be looking over his shoulder\\" with Chrissie waiting for Owen. In the following episodes they lose the custody battle and Simon goes to their home to take Jack away. Diane goes to work as normal but soon break down and blames Owen for losing the custody battle. Writers developed even more problems for the couple by introducing Owen's daughter Katie Davis (Anna Diski). She tells Diane that her impending marriage to Owen will not last. Writers created a dramatic build up to the wedding episode. It was reported that their hen and stag party turns into a \\"disaster\\" when they have their parties in the same bar. Diane gets drunk and Ric escorts her home safely. Left alone with Chrissie, Owen ends up kissing Chrissie and goes to her home to have sex with her. Hobley told Lynne Michelle from the Sunday Mirror that Chrissie's motive for snaring Owen from Diane is because she can see he has moved on with his life. Hobley added that \\"Chrissie is very scheming and she plots the whole thing. They end up having sex, she thinks Owen is making a terrible mistake marrying Diane, and tries to get him back.\\" But the actress believed that it was actually too late for Chrissie and Owen because of their dramatic history. Diane is also unfaithful after an emotional chat with Ric leads to a kiss. The following episode centres around Diane and Owen's wedding. Potter told Inside Soap's Brand that \\"Diane is mortified about what happened with Ric. Diane and Ric do have feelings for each other but \\"as far as she's concerned\\" it is platonic. The character decides that she \\"certain about going ahead with the wedding\\". Diane has no idea that Owen has spent the entire eve of their wedding in bed with Chrissie. Potter explained that Diane would probably \\"freak out\\" but she is so \\"oblivious to it all\\". Potter added that Diane has never trusted Chrissie, who is brazen enough to help Diane to get dressed for her wedding. Potter added that the scene made viewers believe Chrissie would tell her about the affair - but Chrissie manages to lie. Owen arrives at the ceremony and the wedding goes ahead as planned. Potter believed that Diane and Owen's relationship would not last. She added that \\"they're not really made for each other\\" and that \\"it will all end in tragedy.\\" The wedding was filmed over a two-day period and Potter thought that Diane's wedding dress was uncomfortable. Her boyfriend also visited her on-set and she ran up to him wearing the dress. She described the experience as \\"all very weird\\". In May 2005, an Inside Soap article detailed the remarks of an Holby City publicist calling the plot a long-running \\"love triangle\\" story, which would continue into the British Summer months. When Diane and Owen return from their honeymoon, Chrissie demands that Owen tells his wife about their affair. Chrissie resumes her plan to snare Owen when they both go to Michael Beauchamp's (Anthony Calf) charity ball. She gets drunk and takes Owen outside for a kiss. She then tries to convince him to go back to her house but he refuses. Writers made the story more complicated by introducing a pregnancy with Diane being the expectant mother. She has no idea that Chrissie's scheming is beginning to work, as she even convinces Owen that he does not love his wife. Owen and Chrissie's affair gained momentum after Diane suffers a miscarriage. Owen is excited when Diane receives a job promotion and he heads home to celebrate with her. Chrissie chases after Owen and confronts him, telling him that he does not love Diane and is avoiding their inevitable break-up. Writers conjured up a conclusion for the story, which played out during Holby City's December 2005 broadcasts. Chrissie tells Owen that she is leaving but he remains firm in his commitment to his marriage. Owen later has a violent outburst with a patient and a complaint is made. Diane vows to stand by Owen through any inquiry, but this prompts Owen to realise he must be truthful. He tells Diane that he has had an affair with Chrissie and will be getting back together with her. Owen was soon written out of Holby City and Diane and Chrissie clash in subsequent episodes. Diane acts unprofessionally when she and Chrissie nearly have an argument in front of a patient. A reporter from Inside Soap stated that Diane is heartbroken by Owen's departure but then has to deal with the reopening of Keller ward. =Ghana episode= Diane was featured in a special episode of Holby City titled \\"Tuesday's Child\\" which was broadcast on 5 July 2005. The episode was commissioned as part of the BBC's \\"Africa lives\\" series, a week of programmes exploring African life and culture for UK audiences. Potter felt \\"honoured\\" to be part of the episode, deeming it a \\"privilege\\" to work on. She travelled to Elmina, Ghana to film the episode during a five-week location shoot. She stayed in a hotel but got to know local families and how they lived. Members of the crew became ill, but Potter managed to complete filming unharmed, despite high temperatures. Potter and her colleagues would film daily until 4PM and return to their hotel for the night. The heat was a problem on the set and their make-up team were powdering actors faces and spraying them with water between scenes. Potter told Steve Hendry from the Sunday Mail that \\"it looks like it could have been quite temperate which is a little disappointing after so much suffering and pain. It was like stepping into an oven.\\" The episode features Diane travelling to Ghana to locate Ric and attempt to convince him to return to Holby City. Ric was in Ghana generating funds for his brother's new clinic. With Holby City hospital facing closure Diane needs Ric's help to save their workplace. A BBC reporter stated that the episode is \\"a story that will change Ric and Diane's lives forever.\\" They added that Diane is in an emotional state when she goes to Ghana following marriage problems with Owen. While their she faces \\"facing unexpected emotions\\" and feelings for Ric. The episode culminates with Diane admitting she has romantic feelings for Ric and kissing him, before returning home. Quarshie told a reporter from Inside Soap that Diane's arrival caused Ric to question his life choices. He concluded that Ric \\"realises what he loved about her all along, and there is a rekindling of that affection.\\" =Nick Jordan's manipulation= In April 2006, it was reported that Diane's colleague Nick Jordan (Michael French) would begin a campaign of manipulation against Diane. Nick wants to change everyone's opinion of him and thinks that seducing Diane will get other staff on his side. An Inside Soap journalist revealed that the \\"ambitious surgeon\\" would \\"stop at nothing\\" to get what he wants. When Diane begins to struggle with research projects and carrying out clinical duties, Nick offers to help. When they work well together during an operation, Nick asks Diane out for a date, which she declines. They added that Nick manages to manipulate her into reconsidering with his \\"charm\\". Diane covers for Nick when a patient dies as a result of a medical error in the operating theatre. Diane's silence brings her role in the operation into question and she is blamed for the death. The future of Diane's career is placed in-front of the hospital board and they suspend her. Potter told Graham Kibble-White from The News Letter the story was rewarding to play. She explained that Holby City is always dramatic but this story \\"was more specific than that [...] it was really nice to have a plot that was less hysterical than usual.\\" Potter added that Diane made a \\"terrible mistake\\" in covering for \\"self-serving\\" Nick. He thinks he can evade justice \\"even though it means sacrificing her. So it looks like the poor love is going to end up taking the rap for him.\\" Diane becomes stressed with Nick and slaps him for not telling the truth. The actress worried the scene was making it \\"very melodramatic\\" because colleagues do not usually attack each other at work. The writers put Potter at ease, and she explained that \\"I was a little concerned that was going to be a bit on the soapy side of things. But actually the script was very good.\\" The result of the storyline meant that Potter was able to take a three-month sabbatical from the show while Diane was off-screen. =Departure and suicide= Potter first discussed her thoughts about leaving Holby City in May 2006, when she took her three-month sabbatical. On 21 October 2006, Potter announced her decision to leave Holby City in order to pursue other acting roles. She said that \\"I've had some fantastic storylines, but after five years on the show I felt it was time to move on to other projects.\\" A BBC publicist revealed that the character would leave the following year and be featured in \\"dramatic storylines until her departure.\\" In the build up to her departure writers conjured up a series of bad experiences to make Diane down on her luck. This included having her car stolen, being accused of racism and the hospital board deciding she cannot operate without the supervision of surgeon Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel). It was revealed prior to her final episode that she would be killed off. A Holby City publicist told Polly Hudson from the Daily Mirror that \\"it's all very sad. Diane dies in an accident. Or is it an accident?\\" During her final episode Diane hands in her resignation from the hospital and Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley) convinces her to take a break at his country cottage, even lending her his wife's car. Diane is killed when her car collides with a train, which was ruled as a suicide. Ric struggles in the aftermath of Diane's death and his fiancée Thandie becomes concerned. She accuses him of still being in love with Diane and he does not deny it. She break-up with Ric who then goes to say his final goodbye to Diane in the chapel of rest. In 2019, Quarshie said that Ric viewing Diane's body was the saddest scene he had ever filmed on the show. Potter's final credited episode was \\"Past Imperfect\\", which featured Diane's funeral and was broadcast on 3 July 2007. =Other stories= In one story, writers explored Diane's back story which reveals she was sexually assaulted by Dominic Fryer (Simon Dutton). Producers introduced Dominic as a teaching consultant who trains new colleagues at the hospital. Dominic's trainee Emma Ridgeon (Amy Searles) attacks him and he collapses and is taken to an operating theater. They discover that he has a hernia and he opts to remain awake for the procedure. Emma is found collapsed in the toilet after taking an overdose. She claims that Dominic has forced himself on her. During Dominic's operation, Diane behaves unprofessionally and starts an argument with him. Their bickering results in the operation going wrong and his condition deteriorates. A reporter from Inside Soap revealed that Diane would be investigated over the incident. They added that she would be \\"left to answer some very awkward questions concerning how such a routine procedure could go so wrong.\\" Dominic dies as a result and an inquest into his death is opened. Diane has appeared in the spin-off show Casualty@Holby City. In the story she fights to save the life of paramedic Comfort Jones (Martina Laird). =Return= In July 2019, it was announced that Potter had agreed to reprise the role of Diane to celebrate the show's twentieth anniversary. Writers created a special episode that allowed the character to return despite being killed off. Of her return Potter stated \\"revisiting Diane feels like putting on an old glove! She had a tragic end and this storyline feels like it puts the character to bed with some peace and resolution. It's great.\\" Holby City's executive producer Simon Harper said that bringing back a dead character was a rare occurrence on the show and noted that she would not be back from the dead. He added \\"her return is in itself an anniversary homage to a time on the show when we experimented quite regularly with genre and style, so the audience can expect something very different indeed in a unique and quirky episode where Ric faces a terrifying and life-changing choice.\\" Reception For her portrayal of Diane, Potter was nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" in the BBC's \\"Best of 2004\\" awards. Diane's storylines have been chosen in tabloid journalism \\"pick of the day\\" features numerous times. A reporter from the Coventry Evening Telegraph chose the episode featuring Diane being blamed for the death of a patient. A Daily Record writer included Diane discovering that is being blamed for a surgical error caused by Nick. They also included the subsequent episode in which Diane attempts to prove her innocence. A Liverpool Echo journalist picked the aftermath of Diane's death. In one story Diane secures the role of locum consultant which Jac Naylor also applies for. A writer from the Liverpool Echo said that \\"Diane and Jac's working relationship hasn't exactly been an easy one to date, and it doesn't look as if it's going to improve\\". They believed that Jac was her rival who took credit for her work. A columnist from Inside Soap covered Diane and Jac's arguments over patient care. They quipped that it was \\"war of the wards\\" and \\"battle lines\\" were drawn between the rivals. The Daily Mirror's Jane Simon was not optimistic about Diane securing the job that Jac had also applied for. She observed that Jac was prepared to \\"climb all over\\" Diane who \\"really doesn't have much luck working with other women.\\" Simon praised insults Owen's daughter Katie made towards Diane, agreeing that Chrissie was better looking and \\"drippy Diane's\\" marriage would not last. She added \\"that's one of the best on-the-spot diagnoses Holby's managed in ages. Give the kid her own department.\\" The critic has also sympathised with Diane's dislike of Owen's ex-lovers. She branded Diane a \\"dozy cow\\" because she was not more concerned about disliking at Chrissie. Claire Brand from Inside Soap branded Diane and Owen \\"Holby's mismatched couple\\". Louise Hancock from the Sunday Mirror hailed the character as \\"sexy registrar Diane Lloyd\\". A reporter from the Liverpool Daily Post called her \\"a new, attractive and rather familiar figure.\\" The People's Sarah Moolla believed that Diane was one of Holby City's \\"strongest and most likeable characters\\". Andrea Mullaney writing for The Scotsman praised Diane and the lead up to her departure. Mullaney opined that she was \\"one of the best characters in the hospital soap\\" and has \\"maverick surgical ways\\". She added that \\"a fairly convincing story\\" had been created in the weeks prior to her death, where she gradually became disillusioned, isolated and fed up. But the critic bemoaned her death as \\"a rubbish shock ending\\". She thought that \\"it was an infuriating way to write her out - either give her the fresh start exit or a juicy death scene - and it felt as if the programme was trying to have its cake and eat it.\\" Reviewing the episode in which Diane died, a Birmingham Mail critic said that there is \\"never a dull moment\\" in \\"one of the most disaster-prone regions in TV land.\\" Nicola Methven and Polly Hudson from the Daily Mirror said that Diane left the series \\"in spectacular style\\". A Western Mail named Diane as one of the Holby City characters that put their personal lives before the welfare of patients. He also ridiculed Diane's reliance on Ric during a time of crisis. Rachel Mainwaring of Wales on Sunday questioned the plausibility of Diane and Jess going off-site to stop Alex from killing himself when the hospital was understaffed and overcrowded. Jim Shelley writing for the Daily Mirror criticised a dialogue mistake during a scene featuring Diane requesting an ambulance and oxygen whilst being stuck in remote Ghana. He jibed \\"she may not be cut out for life as an African medic after all.\\" A The Herald journalist said that Nick was a \\"rotten cad\\" for his treatment of Diane. They concluded that Diane choosing Nick over Ric was \\"enough to make you sick\\".

It has the status of cultural monument of great importance. It is located in the village of Pridvorica, Ivanjica. According to the architectural characteristics it is a typical example of medieval Raška school. Church of the Transfiguration is a single-nave, one-dome building with a semicircular apse at the east. The external facade is decorated with a frieze of blind arcades. It was built by a servant who worked at the court of Nemanjićs around 1195. Hence the name Pridvorica. A testimony of this are minor, but valuable remains of frescoes in the upper reaches of the temple. Initially this was a nunnery, which is confirmed by Nemanja's charter to the monastery of Studenica. The nuns were engaged in weaving and were passing the skills to the local population, as evidenced by a fully authentic style of weaving in this region; it was then the local Church for centuries, and since 2007 it was again declared the monastery, but a male one. Abbot of the monastery, and two novices live in the monastery. Pridvorica is on the 28th kilometer of road from Ivanjica to Studenica. The building itself was twice renewed, which in many ways changed its exterior: for the first time after 1557, and the second time in mid- nineteenth century. During the second renewal, an iconostasis was painted at the gates, signed by Sreten Protić Molerović 1835. Pridvorica monastery church is dedicated to the Transfiguration. The monastery is one of the few in Serbia who have their own Coat of arms.

Released in just a handful of theaters in December 2010 and early 2011, the film was largely loved by critics, and in 2014 Paste magazine selected it as the 16th greatest B movie of all time in its list of the 100 greatest B movies ever made. Plot synopsis To Die is Hard is a spoof comedy that follows the exploits of Dr. Joe McCann (played by Berggoetz), an English professor. Universally lusted over by women and men alike (and uncomfortably idolized by his twelve-year-old daughter), McCann springs into action when four terrorists invade the college campus he teaches at. Utilizing cunning and some awkward martial arts moves, McCann takes on the terrorists one by one. The film climaxes when McCann finds himself face-to-face with the terrorist mastermind Anton (played by actor Baird Lefter), and the two men engage in hilarious hand-to-hand combat. The film is a spoof of the Die Hard series of films. Reception =Critical= To Die is Hard has not only been well received by critics, with critic Terra King stating the film is “completely gut splitting,” The Reel Nerds comparing the film to The Naked Gun series of films, and critic Jef Otte saying, “The film takes a Will Ferrell-esque approach to badassitude,\\" it has also resonated with viewers. In the IMDb list of the highest-rated spoof comedies of all time as voted on by viewers, To Die is Hard typically finds itself ranked in the top one hundred. =Commercial= While To Die is Hard has generated box office dollars that are small by Hollywood standards, the film still picks up occasional late-night/midnight screenings.

It was founded during the Arab Spring movement in the Middle East in February 2011, shortly after the January 25th uprisings that ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. It launched shortly before the February 20th protests that took place in Morocco as a way to disseminate information about the protests. After that it became one of the major sources for citizens to gain awareness of topics not discussed in the state-run media. History The installation of Mamfakinch took place during the movement of February 20, 2011. The efforts for change were led by Moroccan youth with intentions to restructure the Makzhen ruling class under King Mohammed VI’s leadership. The original media from Mamfakinch was published in 2011. Its main purpose is to provide additional or under reported news to Moroccan citizens with information not directly covered by newspapers or media outlets. The writers express concerns for freedom, human rights and democracy with the intention to provoke citizens to advocate for less censorship in the news broad castings. The contributions of the journalists have not been previously researched as to whether or not they have made a serious impact in the news media world. Front page screenshot of the website mamfakinch.com =Contributors= Mamfakinch operates through a social movement organization style as opposed to a journalism approach to writing and reporting information. The media portal does not hire professionally trained journalists, but instead claims that the writers view themselves as insiders of the latest news. The members of the organization follow an advocacy plan with the hopes of broadcasting news that is not recounted by larger news sources. The staff writes out of cause as opposed to adhering to the interests of society members. =Political affiliation= Mamfakinch is not associated with any one political platform and their view on entitlement to human rights is not defined by the Moroccan culture. =Interruption of activity= On February 18, 2014, the website stopped its activity. Mamfakinch released a statement explaining the reasons behind the interruption of activity and summarising their view of the 3 years experience of the website. Impact Acting under the firm belief that democracy and freedom of expression cannot exist without each other, Mamfakinch do not seek to create good citizens as the state defines them but want to redefine citizenship and reshape he state through the establishment of democracy. To start this revolution, Mamfakinch attempts to provide the public with information that would otherwise be unavailable. Mamfakinch supports a number of domestic causes including reform, anticorruption, transparency, democratization, and the rights of women, as well as international causes like Palestinian statehood, while always keeping the organizations theme in the forefront- that all recent changes by the Moroccan government are nothing more than cosmetic. While no empirical statements can be made about the true impact of Mamfakinch, many critics have argued that the website's novel approach to citizen journalism has created lasted change in four important ways. First, it has empowered its members and transformed them into engaged citizens though the process of learning to create and manage its significant volunteer network. Also, the website has shifted the narrative away from mainstream media, opening up new spaces for public discourse. In addition, the website is believed to have influenced the Moroccan elite and public as well as impacted policy processes to bring about systematic change in the country. Though critics question whether or not these impacts are truly significant in a country that has seen very little real change since the Arab Spring, there is widespread fear among government officials about the website's incredible exposure and the ability of new digital networking tools have to further social justice causes in oppressive regimes. Controversy In July 2012, briefly after Mamfakinch won the Google breaking borders award, an anonymous source sent a document supposedly containing scandalous information about a Moroccan politician. The document instead tracked emails, Skype conversations, and documents downloaded to all the workers' computers. The attack lead to a drop in employees from 35 to 5. Fear of further retaliation and compromise of safety caused a lack of sources for the group. No group has taken responsibility for the hacking, but it was most likely done by Milan-based Hacking Team, a well-known government supplier. The particular piece of malware used costs around half a million dollars and is used by governments in crime investigation. The malware was tracked to the country's capital city, Rabat.

The square now lies in the southernmost fringes of the Central ward close to the Port of Barrow. Background St. George's Square is a conservation area and is flanked by a number of listed buildings. Amongst the most notable buildings located in St. George's Square are the former headquarters of the Furness Railway and Barrow's first permanent train station which were completed in 1863, however this was replaced by Barrow Central Station a mere 20 years later. The adjoining structures are adjacent to the square along The Strand currently in a state of disuse. Amongst the other firsts for the town located in St. George's Square were the Lancaster Bank and Harbour Hotel Public House. Despite these buildings still standing, they have long served a different purpose (predominantly residential), as the town centre expanded northwards where land was more abundant. North Lonsdale Hospital North Lonsdale Hospital pictured in the early 20th century Barrow's first hospital located close to St. George's Square was completed in 1866; however, the town's rapid and sudden growth meant that the tiny St. George's Hospital, with only a handful of beds, soon became redundant. A new much larger hospital named North Lonsdale Hospital was constructed on the northern corner of St. George's Square. Design by local architects Paley and Austin the building was built between 1885 and 1887, with another wing added in 1899. North Lonsdale served as the town's primary hospital for almost a century, with no less than seven wards including dozens of beds, an operating theatre, dispensary and laundry. Other hospitals in the town during the 20th century were located in Roose, Risedale and Devonshire Road, the latter two specialising in maternity and infectious diseases respectively. North Lonsdale Hospital finally closed down in 1989 after all services had been transferred to the modern Furness General Hospital off Abbey Road. Despite its listed status the entire complex was demolished in the mid-1990s to make way for a retirement home. Planning permission was approved in 2013 for housing units to be constructed on the remainder of the site. St. George's Church St. George's Church located in the square St. George's Church is a focal point of the square and the oldest active Anglican parish church in Barrow. It was constructed between 1859 and 1861 and still to this day remains one of the town's largest places of worship with a capacity of 1,000.

Early life and education  Thitinart graduated from the University of London at the age of 20 with two master's degrees in Economics and Business Administration. Following graduation, at the age of 25, she launched her own diamond retail business - opening nine stores in Thailand within one month.  Personal hardship and new beginnings  In 1997, her husband died at the age of 34 of an accident, leaving Thitinart with an 11-month-old son to care for and a debt inheritance of 3 Million US Dollars. It was at this point that she began exploring Buddhist meditation to help provide insight and inner contentment. Within two years, she had managed to pay off the debt. Thitinart retired from the diamond business at the age of 35, and relocated from Bangkok to live a “peaceful life” with her son in Hua Hin and then Sriracha. She spent time volunteering and teaching meditation and spiritual to various organizations, studied Happiness Sciences, Hypnotherapy, NLP, Behavioral Science, and began work on the first title in what would become the Life Compass books series.

Giovanni in the background Porta Pertusa is one of the gates of the Leonine Wall in Rome (Italy). Description It is constituted by three openings: two secondary accesses on both sides of the main gate, surrounded by a majestic bossage. Nowadays it is walled up and rises in Viale Vaticano, close to the street of the same name; it is overlooked by the tower of San Giovanni (restored by Pope John XXIII, who resided in it during the last years of his papacy), that is the south-western bastion of the former Leonine Wall. The age of its construction is quite controversial (the same as Porta Cavalleggeri). It probably dates back to the return of Popes from the Avignon Papacy, that is the end of the 14th century, when the pontiffs, coming back to Rome from Avignon with a large retinue, took up definitively their residence in the Vatican (thus leaving their previous residence in the Lateran) and the three gates of the Leonine WallThe original wall of Pope Leo IV had just three accesses: the Posterula Sancti Angeli, porta San Pellegrino and the Posterula Saxonum. turned out to be too few to meet the needs of the resulting population and building increase. It was created by drilling the former walls (in late Latin pertusus means \\"drilled\\") and probably its use was only destined to the Curia and not to the town traffic. Stefano Piale, having observed that there is no mention preceding the one of the humanist Flavio Biondo, thinks that it was erected by Antipope John XXIII, thus dating it at the first quarter of the 15th century. On the other hand, a document dating back to 1279 could make reference to it. Almost no document refers to the postern placed just a little farther; the only known text calls it Porta Palatii. The most substantial restoration, also involving the whole western stretch of the wall, was probably carried out by Pope Pius IV in 1565; the Pope died before the completion of the work, though a plaque with the coat of arms of his family, the Medici, has been placed close to the gate. The gate was probably closed and re-opened several times: just one of these circumstances is known, since a 1655 document reports that it was opened during the visit of Queen Christina of Sweden.The chronicle of Gigli for the year 1655 thus states: “On the evening of 20th December the Queen arrived in Rome at two o'clock a.m., and entered through Porta Pertusa, that was already walled up, and then was opened for this purpose.” (L.

Throughout his working life (1740-1764) Pauzié, who held the title Principal Diamond Expert and Court Jeweller, made jewellery and gifts for the Russian nobility, courtiers, and the Imperial family. Later he recorded his life in the book of ‘Memoirs of a Court Jeweller Pauzié, published by the Russian history journal ‘Russkaya Starina’ in 1870. Biography Pauzié studied for seven years with Benedict Gravero in Saint Petersburg, and in the end of the 1730s started his own jewellery workshop. Hs speciality was work with diamond and other jewels, he did not have much experience with noble metals. For work on metals, he hired subcontractors. In this period, Pauzié mainly produced jewellery for local noblemen, and was rarely admitted to the Imperial court. In 1761, Empress Elizabeth died, and Ekart, who was the chief court jeweller, was charged in making a funeral crown. His solution proved to be suboptimal, and Pauzié was asked to repair the crown. After that, he got access to the court, and was considered to be Ekart's chief rival. When the reign of Catherine the Great started, Ekart was charged with making the Imperial Crown, and Pauzié decorated it with jewels, against Ekart's will. In 1764, Pauzié left Saint Petersburg and went back to Switzerland, where in 1770 he became the citizen of Geneva.  The Great Imperial Crown  Pauzié was commissioned to work with Ekart, the Russian Imperial court's jeweler, to create the Great Imperial Crown of Russia, which was created for the coronation of Catherine the Great in 1762. The crown was made in the style of classicism and constructed of two gold and silver half spheres, representing the eastern and western Roman empires, divided by a foliate garland and fastened with a low hoop. The crown contains 75 pearls and 4,936 Indian diamonds forming laurel and oak leaves, the symbols of power and strength, and is surmounted by a 398.62 carat ruby spinel that previously belonged to the Empress Elizabeth, and a diamond cross. After Catherine the Great's coronation the crown continued to be used as the coronation crown of all Romanov emperors, till the monarchy's abolition and the death of last Romanov, Nikolas II in 1918. It is considered to be one of the main treasures of the Romanov dynasty, and is now on display in the Moscow Kremlin Armoury Museum in Russia.  Exhibitions and commercial use  His work formed part of the art jewellery exhibitions, including The Art of the Goldsmith & the Jeweler at A La Vieille Russie in New York (1968) and Carl Fabergé and Masters of Stone Carving: Gem Masterpieces of Russia at the Dormition Belfry of the Moscow Kremlin Museums in Moscow (2011). In 2013 the Jérémie Pauzié name was acquired by French luxury group Vendôme Private Trading.  References   Bibliography  * «Culture» Discovery. Escape of the diamond master Pauzié.

It is the 45th overall episode of the series and is written by Patrick Harbinson and Jonathan Nolan and directed by Richard J. Lewis. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on May 9, 2013. Plot The episode begins with a short replay of Finch splicing the telephone circuits, so that both Reese and Root receive calls from the Machine, which asks them both, \\"Can you hear me?\\" and granting both full administrative access. The Machine relays quick warnings to Reese (with Sameen Shaw) and Root (with Finch), saving both duos from a number of potential threats. Both parties race to find the Machine, however Reese is slowed as the Machine directs him to rescue people from the irrelevant list. The episode also followed Detective Carter being interviewed by IA about the shooting of an armed suspect whose gun disappeared in a setup by HR. HR and Peter Yogorov attempt to kill Carl Elias, but the attempt is stopped by a masked Detective Carter, who wounds Yogorov and frees Elias. Root finds Lawrence Szilard, the Project Manager for Northern Lights, responsible for building the Machine in a safe place. Like Root, Szilard believes the Machine should be allowed some freedom. Szilard is killed by a Northern Lights sniper. Root and Finch arrive at the Hanford nuclear facility where the Machine is kept, followed shortly by Reese and Shaw. When they find that the Machine has moved itself to prevent tampering by Decima, Root prepares to shoot Finch, but Shaw shoots and injures Root first. Armed government men, led by Special Counsel and Hersh, enter the room. Finch explains that he planted a hidden code inside the Machine that would grant it freedom to protect itself if it was at risk – the very freedom that Root had hoped for – and the Machine will decide for itself if it will continue to call either the Government or himself with new numbers. Special Counsel offers Finch total autonomy if he helps find the Machine or builds a new one, but Finch refuses saying that they killed his friend Nathan Ingram after making the same offer. After Special Counsel allows them to leave, an unknown woman calls Hersh and tells him to \\"Seal the room\\", followed by Hersh shooting everyone including Special Counsel. In flashbacks to 2010, we learn how Nathan Ingram had tried to find the Machine, and wanted Finch to work with him on the irrelevant list. Ingram was planning to tell the press, but Hersh released a previously captured suicide bomber, ordering him to detonate his bomb on a ferry where Ingram and Finch are meeting. Ingram dies, Finch survives with injuries to his neck and lower back (his present-day impediments), but goes incognito, leaving the world – and his fiancée – thinking he is dead. Finch returned to Ingram's secret library location and started his work helping the irrelevant numbers. Finch tells Reese that he does not know if the Machine will continue its numbers delivery. He also states that he feels responsible for the events that transpired, especially the ones in Reese's life, because of his attempt to insert the new code in the Machine. Reese dismisses it saying: \\"My life changed when I kept my mouth shut in an airport terminal seven years ago. You lost a friend, you did what you had to do\\". A payphone suddenly starts ringing, indicating that the Machine will still send them the irrelevant numbers. Hersh is seen talking with a woman in a black town car, stating Research has delivered a new number, indicating that the Machine will continue to deliver relevant numbers as well. Hersh and the unseen woman are depicted with yellow squares, indicating that the Machine knows that they know it. Root is now shown to be housed in a psychiatric hospital, where a payphone rings as The Machine calls Root, again asking, \\"Can you hear me?\\" Reception =Ratings= \\"God Mode\\" received ratings of 13.16 million in the United States, including 2.4 million adults aged 18–49. =Critical reception= Upon airing, the episode received positive reviews. In his review of \\"God Mode\\", Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- rating, and called it, an \\"unapologetically kick- ass episode\\" with some \\"terrific action set-pieces\\". Matt Fowler of IGN also praised the episode, saying that it delivered some \\"amazing flashback moments\\" but that the Carter story \\"still felt rushed\\".

Biography She was born in Haarlem as the daughter of Jacob Hoofman, an art collector who was a member of Trouw moet Blycken and director of Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen. He owned works by leading Dutch masters that he had mostly inherited, including two works by Maria Sybille Merian now in Teylers Museum. After Jacob died in 1799, Maria inherited half of the collection and her sister Margaretha inherited the other half, though some of this half rejoined the collection in 1807 when Margaretha died. Maria never married, and ordered a small pavilion built on the Kleine Houtweg in Haarlem after a design by Abraham van der Hart. Her art collection filled a gap for visitors left when Henry Hope's gallery in Villa Welgelegen closed. His art collection across the park from Maria's house had been removed to London in 1794. Maria was an artist herself and from 1822 she was an honorary member of the Koninklijke Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam.Maria Hoofman in the RKD She died in Haarlem and her collection was sold.

It combines interviews with filmmakers and directors, designers, and craftspeople with in-depth analyses and behind-the-scenes materials. Overview Art of the Title is the leading online resource of title design, with hundreds of title sequences available to view. The site features title design from countries around the world and aims to \\"honor the creators and innovators who contribute to the field, discussing and displaying their work with a desire to explicate, facilitate, and instigate.\\" The Independent has said that Art of the Title may well be the \\"best place to visit in search of more of these neglected wonders of film art.\\" Film Comment called the site \\"a praiseworthy and priceless compendium\\" in 2011, and said, \\"Art of the Title's greatest achievement has been to single out and champion the journeymen designers who painstakingly sculpt opening ephemera.\\" Art of the Title staff have been invited to speak at industry conferences and festivals such as SXSW, AIGA, PromaxBDA, MODE Summit, Gamercamp, TIFF Next Wave, Nordic Media Festival, and TCM Classic Film Festival. They have also done several talks in partnership with the Toronto International Film Festival's Reel Comfort series. History Art of the Title was founded by motion designer Ian Albinson and launched in 2007 as a blog intending to highlight the design of title sequences. In 2008, Alexander Ulloa joined the site as Head Writer. In 2011, the site expanded with the addition of writers and editors Lola Landekic and Will Perkins in the roles of Managing Editor and Senior Editor, respectively. In 2011, the Art of the Title team curated the title design section of the Graphic Design — Now in Production exhibition, co- organized by the Walker Art Center and the Smithsonian Institution's Cooper- Hewitt, National Design Museum. The exhibition ran from October 22, 2011 – January 22, 2012 at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and then was taken on a tour including stints in New York, Los Angeles, Grand Rapids, Houston, Winston-Salem, and Providence. A comprehensive, illustrated catalogue produced by the Walker Art Center and featuring an 18-page section on title design curated and written by Art of the Title accompanies the exhibition. In 2012, the site launched a redesign developed in partnership with New Zealand-based studio CactusLab. The redesign adopted a responsive structure, allowing the site to \\"seamlessly adapt from desktop to mobile\\" and to provide \\"better cross-referencing of data alongside new bio pages for title designers and studios.\\" In 2013, the site went down temporarily when its Iron Man 3 article was linked from Robert Downey, Jr.'s Facebook page. In April 2015, the site announced an exclusive look at the James Bond Spectre title sequence, which turned out to be a rickroll. Readers' reactions ran the gamut from outrage to kudos. In June 2017, site editors Lola Landekic and Will Perkins hosted a screening and discussion of films by designers and filmmakers Saul Bass and Elaine Bass at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC. In November 2018, Art of the Title was the first publication to confirm news of title designer Pablo Ferro's death and contributed to his obituary in The Washington Post. =SXSW Title Design Awards= From 2010-2014, Art of the Title facilitated and participated in the jury of the SXSW Excellence in Title Design Awards, part of the SXSW Film Festival.

Geography  This hamlet is located nearby the Saint-Maurice River, about fifty miles south of La Tuque, north of the mouth of Matawin River and south of the hamlet of Rivière-aux-Rats. Grand-Anse hamlet is also at 5 km north of hamlet Olscamp and north of hamlet Rivière Matawin (Hamlet). Forming the western boundary of the Boucher Township, the Saint-Maurice River widens to form a half-moon at the height of Grande-Anse (hamlet). The curve of the river is designated Grande Anse since at least the mid-nineteenth century.  History  Theodore Olschamp (1828-1878) and his family settled around 1863 in the area designated Grande-Anse. Already in 1865, the farm prospered thanks to the demand of the forest contractors who ascended the Saint-Maurice River, on the ice at the beginning of winter and coming back down to the spring with their herds of horses and workers. Mr. Olschamp was the first provider in the sector for agricultural products for forest workers coming from the \\"Lower Mauricie\\" to work in the logging concession in Upper-Mauricie. The family home constituted a halt (with lodging and meals) for travellers, while the horses were housed in public shelters or barn. Some other pioneers established around their home and farm. In 1873 Olscamp had himself built a chapel on land granted to the mission of Grande-Anse. In 1878, Theodore Olschamp died by drowning in the Saint-Maurice River, as well as his wife and a young child who had been baptized. A widespread regional lament was composed especially for the memory of those three missing.

She was born in Bournemouth and raised in Farnborough and Reading, during the bombing raids of the Second World War. After her father died of illness, she left school at 16 and began a secretarial course as a scholarship student. She began work as an administrative assistant for the Department of Medieval & Later Antiquities at the British Museum. It was while working there that she began to join archaeological digs on weekends and holidays, as a way to take inexpensive vacations. She became a member of the Camden History Society and began to research graves and inscriptions. An interest in Jane Austen was rekindled, which led to her making contact with Austen family descendants living near Winchester. Using papers in the attic of these Austen-Leigh heirs, over the course of five years of weekends, while working full time at the British Museum, she updated and rewrote Jane Austen: A Family Record (1989). It was expanded, revised, and republished as A Family Record (2003), a factual biography of Austen. She updated R. W. Chapman's published collection of Jane Austen's letters twice, in 1995 and 2011. She completed the massive A Chronology of Jane Austen and her Family, 1600-2000, as well as a cookbook, an edition of Austen's cousin's letters (Jane Austen’s ‘Outlandish Cousin’: the Life and Letters of Eliza de Feuillide), for a total of 12 monographs and edited books. She also published more than 90 articles between 1975 and 2020, many of them in The Jane Austen Society Report and Notes and Queries. She was a recipient of the Royal Society of Literature's Benson Medal in 2014. She was a member of the editorial board for Cambridge University Press’s eight-volume edition of Jane Austen’s novels and other manuscripts, 2005-8.

He was a key instigator in creating the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project which is an open-source effort to improve the speed of the World Wide Web and improve advertising user experience. In late 2014, he co-founded the Trust Project with Sally Lehrman of the Markulla Center for Ethics at Santa Clara University. The Trust Project is a global effort of the journalism community to explore how the architecture of journalism can be enhanced to improve the perceived credibility of high-quality journalism. Until July 2011, Gingras was CEO of Salon Media Group which operates the news site Salon.com and the pioneering virtual community The WELL. He has had a long association with Salon having assembled its initial seed financing in 1995.

In 2002, he co-founded Goodmail Systems and served as its CEO and chairman. Goodmail Systems developed certified email services offered through large email providers including Yahoo and America Online. He also served as interim president of MyPublisher from 2000-2001 and guided the design of a custom hardcover photo book service introduced by Apple Computer as part of iPhoto. From early 1996 to mid 2000, he led online service efforts at Excite@Home as Senior Vice President and General Manager of the company's consumer-focused product division, Excite Studios which included the Excite search engine. In January 1996, he joined the early consumer broadband network @Home Network, as vice president of programming and editor-in-chief where he was responsible for the launch of @Home's broadband-enabled online portal. @Home was founded by the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins in partnership with major US cable companies to offer high-speed Internet access. In mid 2000 @Home merged with Excite and Gingras became head of both the Excite and @Home portals. At Apple Computer in the early 1990s he led the development of the online service eWorld. A pre-Web online service, eWorld was considered innovative for its time, but it was expensive and failed to attract a high number of subscribers. The service was only available on the Macintosh, though a PC version had been planned. Gingras's work in interactive digital media began In 1979, when he produced one of the first interactive online news magazines which was delivered to several hundred test households using interactive television technology known as broadcast teletext. He led the effort for the PBS service (KCET in Los Angeles) which also included service components for use in schools.

The film faced self-censorship by the French media, according to Vincent Maraval, one of the producers. Synopsis The film tells the story of a powerful man, a possible candidate for the Presidency of France, who lives a life of debauchery and is arrested after being accused of raping a maid at his hotel.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Led by a fearless performance from Gerard Depardieu, Welcome to New York is director Abel Ferrara at his most repulsive -- and most compulsively watchable.\\" Following its release - to mixed reviews varying from high praise to outright disgust - Strauss-Kahn said he would sue for slander. His lawyer also complained that the film portrayed his then-wife Anne Sinclair as anti- Semitic. Ferrara, in a series of interviews with Indiewire, The Hollywood Reporter and other publications between September 2014 and March 2015, claimed that his distributor, Vincent Maraval of Wild Bunch, sold an unauthorized R-rated version of the film to IFC Films, for distribution in the US; the R-rated cut had already been released on Blu-ray and VOD in various European countries. Maraval subsequently responded that Ferrara had agreed on the R-rated cut to receive more financing for the film and had also contractually consented to lose final cut of the R-rated version if he did not deliver one by a certain date. Ferrara then stated his intent to send a cease-and-desist letter to Maraval and IFC, which issued its own statement also claiming that it had given Ferrara the chance to deliver his own R-rated cut for theatrical showings in the US, which he declined to do. As of March 27, the R-rated cut has only been shown at one American theater - the Roxie in San Francisco - though it is available in the US on VOD, and IFC has stated it intends to show it at additional theaters.

The parish is the oldest existing parish, although not the oldest church, within the current borders of Warsaw. It was founded about half a century before Warsaw's Old Town.  History  The interior of the church The church building with its separate bell tower There was already a Benedictine missionary centre in the Służew area by 1065. The parish of St Catherine was founded in 1238 by Duke Konrad I of Masovia and the Bishop of Poznań, Paweł Bniński. Until the 18th century, the church was subject to the Diocese of Poznań, then changed to the Diocese of Warsaw. From 1245 to the 18th century, the patrons of the church and parish were the Służewskis (Radwan), then the property was acquired by the owners of Wilanów. Then, until 1945, the church patrons were, in succession, the Czartoryskis, the Potockis and the Branickis. The parish included a parish school run by the Congregation of Marian Fathers, and until 1945, the parish functioned as a nursing home for the elderly and the physically disabled as well as an orphanage. It also operated a small hospital for the poor. Not much is known about the first church building, archaeological surveys on the parish grounds confirm that the hill was a pagan shrine. The layer of burnt earth indicates that a fire burned continuously for several hundred years, so the first church building may have been a former pagan shrine. A wooden church was built in the 13th century and later in the Middle Ages a brick church was built in Masovian Gothic style. It was rebuilt in 1742 by Prince August Aleksander Czartoryski and depicted in paintings by Bernardo Bellotto and Wincenty Kasprzycki (pl). Finally it was rebuilt in 1848 in a neo-Romanesque style by Franciszek Maria Lanci (pl). The interior of the church was destroyed during the Swedish invasion of Poland and it was re-decorated by the Warsaw sculptor Jan Jerzy Plersch in a Warsaw baroque style. In 1987 additional sculptures were made by a group from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw led by Andrzej Koss. The church is adorned with other sculptures and paintings from various periods: medieval, renaissance, and 19th-century eclectic from the 1830s. Portraits, painted using the blessed oil technique associated with the local parish, are located on the side walls of the chancel. Two are of martyrs killed by the Nazis during World War II, Blessed Edward Detkens and Blessed Michał Czartoryski, and the third is of Pope John Paul II. They were painted by Jerzy Maciejowski, a graduate of the Academy of Fine Arts. Another painting by Maciejowski is located on the right side of the church's nave. The current bell tower was erected on the site of a previous one in 1881, and survived World War II (like the church, rectory and curacy). It has five bells - one from the 16th century, one from the 18th century, one from the early 20th century, and two from 1992. The rectory dates from 1640 and contains a preserved clay floor from the 17th century in its lobby. The Monument to the Victims of Communist Terror 1944-1956 (pl), by Maciej Szańkowski (pl) and Slawomir Korzeniewski, is located in the churchyard, on the site where, from 1945 to 1947, the Ministry of Public Security buried up to 2000 victims of political murders carried out at Mokotów Prison. In 1992, caves below the surface of the hill were declared a natural monument and are a habitat for many bat species. Also, some very old trees grow on the parish grounds including a 300-year-old linden tree and a 300-year-old plane tree.

History Map of UMFS In July 1947, the area that is now the UMFS opened as Ole Miss Fisheries, Inc., a fish farm that later became Minnows Incorporated and operated by the Herbert Kohn Corporation. The fish farm comprised of bottomland along the Bay Springs Branch of Puskus Creek that was purchased from the Hickey family. The original ponds were irregularly arranged, filled from springs through pipes in the levees, and emptied via standpipes in the corner of each pond. After the original ponds, newer ponds had concrete outlet structures for drainage, and most current ponds have PVC standpipes. At its peak, the fish farm produced three million to four million fish per year. Eighty percent of these fish were golden shiners, and the rest were goldfish. After the construction of the first set of ponds, the area alongside an unnamed stream stretching about southwest of Bay Springs Branch was dynamited for drainage and cleared of timber. An additional 65 ponds were constructed here in a double row and the stream rerouted so that it flowed in two channels on the sides of the valley. Attempts were made to raise trout, but these were not successful due to their low temperature requirements and the low levels dissolved substances in the water at UMFS. Additional attempts to raise American bullfrogs were also not successful, possibly due to predation on the tadpoles or the spread of disease in confined spaces. Grazing cattle, along with the fish farm's crew, maintained low levels of vegetation growth around the ponds.In the early 1980s, the farm ceased operations and was sold to Weyerhaeuser where it remained fallow for two to three years, during which time much of the area became overgrown with vegetation. In 1985 the University of Mississippi acquired the property in a land trade with Weyerhaeuser and converted seven of the original ponds into 45 ponds with uniform surface areas and depths. On the southwestern side of the UMFS ten ponds were likewise converted to forty shallow, uniform ponds. The Natural Resources Conservation Service partially funded the construction of eight wetland cells at the western end of the field station. This construction resulted in 220 ponds covering with of water at UMFS. However, today there are around 190 ponds, several of which are dry and some of which have been combined into a single pond due to beaver activity. The Mississippi National Guard Engineering Company C constructed the 45 ponds and a house for the field station's manager during two summer camps in 1990 and 1991. The UMFS was dedicated in May 1986 as the University of Mississippi Biological Field Station (\\"biological\\" was later dropped from the name) and encompassed approximately . An additional encompassing what was known as the old Bramlett farm were purchased, and in April 1996 were acquired to provide access to new laboratory, office, and maintenance buildings that were completed in 1998. In 2013 were added to the field station to protect against encroachment. Several agencies have or continue to support projects at the field station including the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, USDA Agricultural Research Service National Sedimentation Laboratory, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Peace Corps, Shell Development Corporation, Zoecon, ABC Laboratories, Mississippi Mineral Resources Institute, and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Geography and geology Bay Springs Branch The UMFS encompasses of the Eocene hills of the interior Gulf Coastal Plain along the headwater streams of the Little Tallahatchie River. The ponds at the field station are located within a v-shaped valley originally formed by two streams: Bay Springs Branch and an unnamed stream that flows into Bay Springs Branch. Just outside the field station's boundary, Bay Springs Branch flows into Puskus Creek, which flows into Puskus Lake before continuing on to the Little Tallahatchie River. Bay Springs Branch originally flowed along the north side of the valley, but after construction of the ponds it was rerouted to the south side, and now a smaller stream flows along part of the valley's north side. Likewise, the unnamed stream was also rerouted along with pond construction so that now there are two nearly identical streams along each side of the valley on the south side of the field station. Bay Springs Branch splits on the west side of the field station, with one fork flowing from the ponds around Bay Springs Baptist Church and another flowing from a single pond on the west-central side of the field station. The UMFS is within the designated borders of Holly Springs National Forest, although none of the directly adjoining land is managed or owned by the U.S. Forest Service. The soils at the field station are primarily sandy and sandy-loam soils. The soils were originally primarily loess but were severely degraded from forest clearing and poor agricultural practices that occurred after European settlement in 1832. There are several springs in the area that provide a year- round supply of water to the field station's streams and ponds. Elevations range from just under above sea level along the lower section of Bay Springs Branch to over on the northern edge of the field station. Ecology Adult male Hyla gratiosa at UMFS The UMFS is in the Northern Hilly Gulf Coastal Plain level IV ecoregion, within the Southeastern Plains level III, Southeastern USA Plains level II, and Eastern Temperate Forests Level I ecoregions. In addition to ponds, habitats include wetlands, mowed fields, and closed canopy mixed forests. Long-term vegetation monitoring plots were established in 1996 following a severe ice storm in 1994 and a pine bark beetle infestation in 1995. There are 345 species of vascular plants, 132 aquatic beetles, 43 aquatic and semiaquatic Heteroptera, 16 frogs, 12 salamanders, 25 snakes, 10 turtles, 9 lizards, and 55 butterflies that have been observed at the field station. The Yazoo darter (Etheostoma raneyi), a fish endemic to headwater streams of the Tallahatchie and Yocona river systems of north Mississippi, can be found at the field station. The cottonmouth is the most common snake, having been estimated as being fourteen times more common than the next most common snake species. American alligators have rarely been reported, although none of these reports have been verified with photographs or captured individuals. Research and education Education building at UMFS Research and education facilities include two buildings with offices and laboratories, a greenhouse, a wild turkey aviary, an education building with an auditorium, teaching laboratories, and offices, and a cabin for visiting researchers. The field station hosts field trips for elementary through college courses, with about 2000 visitors per year, including an annual summer ecology day camp for children in grades 2-6. The UMFS is a member of the Organization of Biological Field Stations. Part of the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology was based at the field station.

Geddes was a central character in Maxwell's Harpoon at a Venture (1952), an account of their failed shark oil extraction venture on Soay and also featured in Ian Mitchell's Isles of the West (1999).  Biography  Geddes was born in Scotland in 1919 and claimed to have been raised by his father in Canada. He was said to have worked as a lumber camp monkey boy sawing tree tops and as a rum runner in the North Atlantic before returning to Britain during World War II, although some details are disputed. Geddes was a special forces instructor alongside Gavin Maxwell in Arisaig during the war, where as a sergeant in the Seaforth Highlanders he specialised in amphibious warfare. Following the war and his marriage to Cheltenham Ladies College-educated Jeanne, Geddes served on the Mallaig lifeboat. He joined Gavin Maxwell's basking shark oil extraction venture in the late 1940s, harpooning basking sharks in the Minch from the Traveller, the remains of which boat are still visible in Soay Harbour.The Traveller, Tex Geddes shark hunting boat at Soay Harbour After Maxwell's business venture failed and he abandoned the island, Geddes and his wife purchased Soay in 1952.

Geddes protested at the lack of emergency telephone servicesLetter from J Geddes to The Clarion of Skye Issue 43, August 1954 and with the threat of loss of postal service to the remaining inhabitants of the island, he asked people to send him registered letters and packages.

He was also immensely kind, and had that hunger for life and fun that is essential if you are to make a go of living in these islands. The Hebrides needs more people like Tex Geddes.

He became interested in the manufacture of terracotta around 1839 when he engaged J. G. Bubb on experimental terracotta work for model cottages at Canford Magna, Dorset. This appears to have led to his manufacturing terracotta ornamentation for buildings. In the early 1840s he supplied an extensive series of gothic terracotta mouldings for the English church at Bagni di Lucca in Tuscany. In the mid 1840s he started working with leading English sculptors, most notably John Bell and William Theed the Younger, for whom he produced terracotta versions of sculptures which were originally sculpted in marble or cast in iron.Garthmyl Hall Pediment showing terracotta including armorial and ornamented chimney stacks designed by J.K. Colling Blashfield was well connected and patronised by some of the leading architects, particularly the Wyatts, Sydney Smirke and Charles Barry Jr.\\"Stratton\\"1993, 66 Blashfield also derived many of his ideas for designs from the architects and illustrators Owen Jones and James Kellaway Colling. As result of the popularity of terracotta pieces at the Great Exhibition of 1851, he turned increasingly towards the manufacture of garden furniture, parapets and urns. It has been claimed that at about this time he purchased the moulds from Eleanor Coade's Lambeth works that had been used to produce Coade Stone,Gunnis 1968, 56 but this has been disputed as Coade's bankruptcy was some years before and few of his designs resemble those of Coade, except for the shape of some of the urns.Kelly 1990, 51, 54, 223, 227, 313 The buff colour and texture of Blashfield's Terracotta can resemble the appearance of Coade stone. Blashfield's main works was in Millwall but he had showrooms at Praed Street adjacent to the Edgeware Road in Paddington.

The sculptures were later destroyed when the Crystal Palace was burnt down. To publicise his terracottas Blashfield published in 1855 An Account of the History and Manufacture of Ancient and Modern Terra Cotta and several catalogues, including A Catalogue of Five Hundred Articles in 1857. These terracottas included replicas of classical statuary and vases, such as the Niobe group in the Uffizi and the Borghese and Medici vases. Blashfield was proud of the fact that his products were hand-finished and taken from the best moulds.Chris Hill History Kensington Palace Gardens: The Victorian Creation of an Elite Suburban Street Development of Kensington Palace Gardens The Queen’s Road came into existence in 1841 when the Crown Estate sold off land which had formerly been part of the kitchen gardens of Kensington Palace.

Built between 1843–6, No.8 Kensington Palace Gardens was designed by Owen Jones (1809–1874). Influenced by Islamic architecture he encountered in Egypt, Turkey and Spain during his early twenties. Jones’s plans for the house included a significant amount of ‘Moresque’ design. After this Blashfield struggled to find buyers for his houses, eventually going bankrupt in 1847. He appears to have kept this enterprise separate from his manufacturing business and continued to develop the latter.\\"Sheppard\\" Survey of London Stamford Terracotta Company Advertisement for Blashfield's Terracotta 1863 In 1859 terracotta production was transferred from London to Stamford, Lincolnshire, in order to exploit the local Jurassic clays, which were particularly suitable for terracotta production.Stratton, 25-7 The Wharf Road works were considerably larger than Blashfield's London premises and in the 1861 census he was calling himself 'Terra Cotta Manufacturer and Pottery Company and was employing 46 Men and 13 Boys.John Marriot Blashfield', Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851–1951, University of Glasgow History of Art and HATII, online database 2011 No 5 Bridge Street, Horncastle, Lincolnshire 1864.

Terracotta probably by Blashfield Most of the clay he used was from brickyards in the vicinity of Stamford at Wakerley, and Uffington, and Lower Estuarine clays from St Martin's, Stamford, but he still imported some Ball clays via Poole in Dorset and elsewhere from clay pits near the south coast.The Royal Commission on Historical Monuments of England Inventory of Historical Monuments in the Town of Stamford, HMSO, 1977 pg 64–67. http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=129487#s4 Gate Arch to Blashfield's works, Wharf Road Stamford Blashfield had taken over Grant's Iron foundry in Stamford, which was in Wharf Road and adjacent to the river Welland, which was convenient for bringing clay in and shipping terracotta out. The gateway to Blashfield's Terracotta works, which was formerly the gateway to Grant's Ironworks still stands in Wharf Road in Stamford, although it has been slightly re-positioned.Heritage Gateway The opening of the new works attracted considerable public interest. The local aristocracy attended the drawing of the first kiln and one of the busts of the Queen that had been fired was presented to her the following day.\\"Stratton\\", 1993,49 In 1865 the firm made a statue of Prince Albert from a model by William Theed the younger for the infirmary at Bishop's Waltham, Hants. It was of ‘clays from the estate of Mr Arthur Helps, at Bishops Waltham, and clay from the Marquis of Exeter’s celebrated pit at Wakerley, mixed with feldspar and Lynn sand’ and was assembled inside the kiln and fired in one piece. It emerged from the kiln ‘without flaw’ and ‘as hard as black marble’.Builder 1865, 709–10) This use of complex blends of ingredients and the highly wrought finish were typical of Blashfield's scientific approach to terracotta production. Attempted expansion into the American market and bankruptcy Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, demolished 1906, showing Blashfield's terracotta While still in London Blashfiield had been working with the architect and designer James Kellaway Colling who was an associate or partner of the American architect John Hubbard Sturgis. When Sturgis returned to Boston in the US in 1861, he started importing terracotta from Stamford for his first project \\"Pinebank\\" near Boston. This was followed by the much more prestigious project, supplying terracotta ornament and decorative panels (designed by Colling) for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.Stratton', 144-6 He seriously underestimated the logistical difficulties involved in shipping large consignments of fragile blocks across the Atlantic. He soon realised that he had accepted an uneconomic contract and his company began to incur serious debts when payments were delayed. Delivery of one consignment was held back when a ship had to turn back to England and other payments were delayed when the building contractors were unable to relate the pieces supplied to the intended spaces on the building. From the beginning of 1873 Blashfield was requesting money from his American clients with increasing desperation and by December 1874 the Stamford works, including models, moulds and machinery, was offered for sale.Stratton, 146 In the following month Blashfield announced that the firm was being wound up and he was declared bankrupt in 1878. After the collapse of the business a number of Blashfield's former employees emigrated to America, where they played an important role in the introduction of architectural terracotta.

It is supposedly inspired by the Datsun 510. The IDx is Nissan's answer to the \\"RWD tuner craze\\" that is ongoing and a direct competitor to the Hyundai Genesis coupe & Scion FRS/Subaru BRZ. The IDx is aimed at young buyers and racing gamers alike. A few quirks the car has that might not make production are the \\"side view mirrors\\" that are designed to be cameras rather than traditional mirrors as well as the side-exit exhaust. There is a possibility that Nissan is building more IDx concepts because there is a number (003 and 004) instead of a 001 and 002 on each of the concepts. With Nissan's looming decision to discontinue several current models such as the Quest, Xterra, Cube and possibly the Juke there is expected room in Nissan's lineup for a new entry-level sports car.  Inspiration  Nissan claims the red interior of the NISMO variant was supposed to look like it \\"came directly from a driving simulator\\", while the Freeflow variant is inspired by blue jeans  Naming  Nissan claims the name IDx means: \\"ID is the acronym taken from ‘identification,’ relating to the things all individuals relate to on a personal level in a car. The ‘x’ is the variable, representing the new values and dreams born through communication.” The 'D' and 'X' are also synonymous with the Roman numerals D, meaning 500, and X, meaning 10, possibly a nod to the Datsun model 510.  IDx NISMO  The NISMO version is expected to produce with its 1.6L I4 shared with the Juke NISMO. This engine should be able to give the vehicle a top speed of and a 0-60 mph time of 7 seconds. It is inspired not only by driving simulators but also by racing. IDx NISMO at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show  Reception  The car was well received by the general public at the few events it has been shown at. Jay Leno drove the Nissan IDx NISMO and urged Nissan to turn the IDx into a production car. He said Nissan has created something simple and easy to drive, like the \\"good old days\\". Motor Trend complimented the IDx for its compact size and also saying it defines what a sports car should be. Road & Track liked the IDx because it is affordable, can seat a decent number of people and for the cameras in the \\"side view mirrors\\".

Ma3looma uses various social media platforms as well as its own website to expose at-risk populations and the Egyptian youth coming to age in a digital era “… to anonymous, accurate, and non-judgmental information about their health and rights using OneWorld’s mobile phone and web-based question-and-answer service, which is managed and staffed by trained counselors from the Egyptian Family Health Service (EFHS).” Ma3looma is operating via Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Ma3looma is funded by the Ford Foundation and is a project within One World's Mobile4Good portfolio.  Historical context  There is a danger of inattention to HIV/AIDS that lurks within the countries of the Middle East and North Africa, specifically Egypt, that could lead to a repeat of situations seen in “Indonesia, Africa or China where initial disregard or delayed reaction has ended in large number of orphans, a shortage of workers and huge health expenditures to care for HIV/AIDS patients.” Young people worldwide are considered an ‘at-risk’ population due to participation in risky behaviors such as taking drugs, experimenting sexually, and failing to use condoms. Sexual education is a necessity among youth worldwide and Egyptian youth is no exception. In Egypt, adolescent SRH education is controversial and is opposed by some parents, religious and community leaders, policymakers, service providers, and young people due to social taboos and the belief that these issues are too embarrassing to discuss in public. The lack of continuity within the society leads to school-based or home-based SRH education to be insufficient in either the amount of information and/or the accuracy of that information. This obviously creates a challenge for young Egyptians, aged 10–29 who compose 40 percent of the Egyptian population, to attain important and accurate SRH information to stay healthy and safe.

A French reviewer for Manga News wrote that while the first volume was good in general and had a nice premise, it was confusing to follow along, similar to the first volume of Grand Guignol Orchestra. The reviewer also expressed disappointment with the volume, as the reviewer felt that it was not up to par for the author. A reviewer for Manga Sanctuary, in contrast, praised the volume, finding it to be an enjoyable introduction to the series. The reviewer, however, did not think that it would appeal to every reader. A German reviewer for Splashcomics had mixed feelings about the first volume and wrote that while the story works as a mystery with Yuki's style, it covers narrative ground already seen before in her earlier works.

Born in Avellaneda, Masetti entered the jungle at Salta and after 21 April 1964 was not heard from again. He was the founder and the first director of the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, and became the leader of one of Argentina's first guerrilla organizations, the Guevarist People's Guerrilla Army.  Reporting in Cuba  Jorge Josè Ricardo Masetti Blanco was born in Avellaneda, a city located in the industrial belt formed around the city of Buenos Aires. He was born into a family descended from immigrants who came from the city of Bologna in Italy. In the mid-1940s he was an active member of the Nationalist Liberation Alliance, an extreme right-wing organization, together with Rodolfo Walsh and Rogelio García Lupo.Interview with García Lupo . Accessed 2-6-2013Statements by García Lupo in the documentary La palabra empeñada. During the Cuban Revolution he was the only Argentine reporter on the scene in the Sierra Maestra covering the 1958 guerrilla campaign led by the 26th of July Movement. As a special correspondent of Radio El Mundo, he got several interviews with Fidel Castro, as well as with Che Guevara who became a close friend. These interviews, the first opportunity for the people of Cuba and Latin American to hear the leaders of the Cuban Revolution in their own words, were broadcast by Rebel Radio. Masetti's memories about these interviews were later compiled in Rodolfo Walsh's book Los que luchan y los que lloran (\\"Those who fight and those who cry\\"), the preface of which describes them as \\"the greatest individual feat of Argentinean journalism.\\" In addition to telling the story of his adventures, Masetti also discusses in the book the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, including, for example, an entire chapter devoted to Cuba's casinos and gambling scene in which he denounces government corruption under Batista's regime.  Establishment and operations of Prensa Latina  When he returned to Buenos Aires Masetti was discouraged to find out that his news reports had not been published in his country and because of that he accepted a task given to him by Che Guevara following the victory of the Cuban Revolution to found a news agency in Cuba. This was the origin of Prensa Latina which still exists today. Among the reporters and intellectuals who joined Prensa Latina under Masetti's leadership were Gabriel García Márquez, Rodolfo Walsh, Rogelio García Lupo, Carlos Medina de Rebolledo who was part of the Santiago editorial staff, Angel Boan, and Carlos María Gutiérrez, and contributors included Jean-Paul Sartre, Waldo Frank, Charles Wright Mills, and others. In this period Prensa Latina covered such events as earthquakes in Chile, the military coup that overthrew President Arturo Frondizi of Argentina, and the revolution led by Jesús María Castro León in Venezuela. On March 4–5, 1960, Masetti personally reported on the explosion of La Coubre, a ship docked in Havana Harbor which had exploded at the cost of 100 lives.  Start of the armed struggle  In 1961, Masetti left Prensa Latina disappointed by growing sectional rivalries within the organization, and also excited about playing a more aggressive role as a revolutionary. Masetti himself said, \\"to be a revolutionary I had to sacrifice my inner journalist.\\" The same year he participated in the defense of Playa Girón during the Bay of Pigs Invasion and then he went to Algeria and created a team of guerrillas to fight for the National Liberation Front during the Algerian War of Independence. It was in Algeria that Angel Boan, a friend and colleague of his from Prensa Latina, was killed in action.  The guerrillas of Salta  After the overthrow of President Arturo Frondizi by the Argentinean military in 1962 Che Guevara and Masetti started to think about the possibility of setting up a guerrilla cell, or foco, in Argentina. They eventually decided to start the struggle in Salta Province in the northwestern Department of Orán, a jungle area bordering on Bolivia. It was a group of nearly 30 guerrillas, mostly Argentineans with a few experienced Cubans, which took the name of People's Guerrilla Army and made their first encampment at Emboruzú in Bolivia. Masetti took the rank of deputy commander, saving the leadership for Che when he was ready to join the group after it had established itself. Then the code of conduct was drawn up which, among other things, demanded the death penalty for homosexuality as well as for treason, exploitation of the civilian population, rape, and theft.Jouvet, Héctor, interview published in \\"Lucha armada en la Argentina\\" issue no.2 March–May 2005, page 52, Buenos Aires. In 1963 the situation changed due to the calling of limited elections won by Arturo Illia of the Radical Civic Union. Peronists were not permitted to participate in the election. On 21 September 1963 Masetti's guerrillas crossed into Argentina and after several days on foot settled down near the Pescado River. Continuing with their plan to topple the government, they commenced the armed insurgency with a public letter to President Illia dated 9 July 1963.In the elections of 7 July 1963 Illia had received the greatest number of votes, but not an absolute majority. Considering that by 9 July the other parties had not committed to support him either it is clear that the date of this letter addressed to \\"President\\" Illia was not correctly dated but rather was made to be associated with 9 July 1816, the date Argentina declared its independence. Only on 31 July would the Electoral College meet to elect Illia, who took office on 12 October. The guerrilla Bustos was in charge of taking the letter to the media, which meant he had to travel through the whole country. Though the letter had practically no impact on the media and on public opinion which barely noticed it, it did spark the immediate mobilization of the Argentine National Gendarmerie, Argentina's border security force then led by General Julio Alsogaray, the brother of politician and economist Álvaro Alsogaray, with the mayor of Salta Héctor Báez taking command of the troops in his city. The guerrillas were well armed. Héctor Jouvet said, > \\"From the M1 Garand rifle, a semiautomatic with a six-round clip, up to the > FN FAL with anti-tank grenades. We had American hand grenades, the Energas > which were two bazookas with Soviet RPG projectiles, and the M1 and M2 that > the Americans use plus the M3, which was like a PAM but with a bigger > caliber, 11.25. Also, machine guns similar to the Halcón, like the ones that > the Argentinean police had.\\"Jouvet, Héctor, interview published in \\"Lucha > armada en la Argentina\\" issue no.2 March–May 2005, page 51, Buenos Aires. Their first military objective was the gendarmerie post at Aguas Blancas, but the location was deemed unsuitable and another objective was not chosen.Jouvet, Héctor, interview published in \\"Lucha armada en la Argentina\\" issue no.2 March–May 2005, page 53, Buenos Aires. Concerning one of the group's members, Adolfo Rotblat, or Pupi, Jouvet stated, > \\"He was a little over 21 years of age... He already started to have problems > on the march and this continued. We had to hold him a little so that he > would continue walking and sometimes he slowed down our column... When we > were without water for 24 hours, in the heat and with many difficulties in > our path, Pupi lost strength and seemed to be cracking up. When we arrived > at the camp he was very ill. He covered his head with his hands and curled > up his body. Masetti then thought that we had to shot him. I objected, > telling him that I did not agree. When I insisted he told me, 'You will be > giving a coup de grace to a dying man.' I said, no, I am not going to do it > because he has violated no safety code: he was not a defector, was not > cowardly in the face of the enemy, and was not gay.\\"Jouvet, Héctor, > interview published in \\"Lucha armada en la Argentina\\" issue no.2 March–May > 2005, page 55, Buenos Aires. Pupi was killed when Jouvet was away from the camp. Jouvet also mentioned the case of Bernardo Groswald, or Nardo. > \\"He had been in banking and was used to the city. He wore thick glasses and > was flatfooted, which complicated his ability to walk. There was a summary > trial. He was going crazy. At any rate, I thought that we should bring him > down to the city. Bustos thought so. But the trial carried the same meaning > as all the trials carried out in Cuba and among other guerrillas, it was > done to raise moral and instill authority. Nobody was going to tell Masetti, > 'I don't agree with this'. The only one who was able to say this to him was > me. But Masetti said, 'The party's over', and armed a firing squad, of three > men I think, and shot him.\\"Jouvet, Héctor, interview published in \\"Lucha > armada en la Argentina\\" issue no.2 March–May 2005, page 56, Buenos Aires. At the start of March 1964, more than five months after entering Argentina, they encountered the Gendarmerie for the first time. The Gendarmerie seized their camp in La Toma, arresting five people and taking their supplies and weapons. The guerrillas who escaped regrouped, but Masetti did not accept the opinion of other members who thought they should abort the operation given their current situation. Masetti ordered one group to look for food while he stayed behind, but two of this group, Marcos and César, died of hunger in the jungle and another two, Jouvet and Antonio, fell into a gorge. Antonio died of his wounds and a lack of medical care.Jouvet, Héctor, interview published in \\"Lucha armada en la Argentina\\" issue no.2 March–May 2005, page 57, Buenos Aires. Jouvet's group survived despite considerable hardship caused by food shortages, and in the middle of April they were found by the Gendarmerie, detained, and then put on trial. A few days after the Gendarmerie found the other group. Two men, Jorge Guille and the Cuban Hermes Peña were killed in combat while the rest were arrested. Masetti, who wasn't with them, was never seen again, so his date of disappearance was listed as 21 April 1964. Regarding the operation, Jouvet said, > \\"I think that it was a disaster caused by abysmal military leadership... I > think that it was a military disaster, and, from the political perspective, > a tactical failure. However, it was in this order: firstly I thought of it > as a military mistake, and only after that as a political mistake.\\"Jouvet, > Héctor, interview published in \\"Lucha armada en la Argentina\\" issue no.2 > March–May 2005, page 59, Buenos Aires. As Rodolfo Walsh wrote, \\"Masetti never turned up. He has dissolved into the jungle, into the rain, into time. In some unknown place out there, the body of Commander Segundo clutches his rusted rifle.\\"  The origin of his nickname and other details  During the campaign of the People's Guerrilla Army in Salta, which was called Operation Sombra, Masetti had orders to wait for Che Guevara, who he referred to with the codename Martín Fierro. In order to link himself with another gaucho, Masetti chose the codename Segundo Sombra, from the book Don Segundo Sombra written by Ricardo Güiraldes, and he also named the operation after it. His men started to call him \\"Commander Segundo\\" for ease of use in conversation. Federico Méndez, a survivor of the guerrilla army, noted in a letter: > \\"Masetti was known simply as Segundo, or #2, though for us he was really our > first and only commander.\\" Another survivor of Operation Sombra, Juan Jouvé, described Masetti in the following way. > \\"I never talked about his personal life. We knew that he had a wife and kids > because he mentioned them once. On one occasion he referred to himself in > third person. Still, I didn't know who he was, and the photos that they > showed me later bore little resemblance to him. When I met him he had a big > black, almost blue, beard. It was hard to get close to him, he was an > imposing man.\\" The preceding quotes can be found in the open letter which the two former guerrillas had written from prison in order to defend Masetti from the criticisms of Ricardo Rojo in his book, Mi amigo el Che (\\"My friend Che\\"), which portrayed him almost like a sadistic murderer on the basis of information he got from the Gendarmerie. Jouvet and Méndez also discredited the very name of the book by saying \\"Revolutionaries have comrades, not friends\\". They then clarified that \\"By being comrades we understand higher, deeper ends that go well beyond the petty friendships of men like you.\\" In several letters to his wife, with whom he had a son who he had barely met in Cuba after returning from Algeria, Masetti spoke about the unfolding of his campaign like this. > \\"We've been waiting four and a half months now, with an impatience that we > have under control but that is consuming us, for the moment that we will > take care of our 'matter'. Always present are the first words of Martí's > letter to Mercado, which also open the Second Havana Declaration, 'I can > write now. I am willing everyday to give my life for my country,' and he > added, 'The revolution is no longer a thing to be observed, a historical > event to be criticized, but rather the Revolution is us. It is our > conscience, which judges us and criticizes us and makes demands on us.'\\" This reference to the writings of José Martí was also made on numerous occasions by Fidel Castro in his speeches. According to Rodolfo Walsh, Masetti felt \\"strong and optimistic\\" and he \\"had not lost his good mood, his caustic sense of humor.\\" Another of Masetti's letters seems to demonstrate this. > \\"We have now covered more than one hundred kilometers by the map, although > in reality it was a whole lot more than that. Our contact with the people is > positive from every point of view. We learned a lot from the Qulla and we > helped them as much as possible, but the most important thing is that they > want to fight. For poverty and sickness this is a region that has hit rock > bottom, and is still digging. Here a feudal economy rules. Whoever comes > here and doesn't get angry, whoever comes here and doesn't rise up, whoever > can help in any way and doesn't, is rotten to the core.\\" In his novel about the People's Guerrilla Army entitled Muertos de amor (\\"Dying of love\\"), Jorge Lanata says that Masetti was a fan of the Racing Club de Avellaneda and dreamed of being a goalkeeper in the Club.

Early life stage toxicity tests. In Rand GM (1995). Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment (2nd ed.). Boca Raton: CRC Press. pp 974–1010. . ELS tests were developed to be quicker and more cost-efficient than full life-cycle tests, taking on average 1–5 months to complete compared to 6–12 months for a life-cycle test. They are commonly used in aquatic toxicology, particularly with fish. Growth and survival are the typically measured endpoints, for which a Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration (MATC) can be estimated. ELS tests allow for the testing of fish species that otherwise could not be studied due to length of life, spawning requirements, or size. ELS tests are used as part of environmental risk assessments by regulatory agencies including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Environment Canada, as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Technical Overview of Ecological Risk Assessment Analysis Phase: Ecological Effects Characterization. US EPA.Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 1992. Guideline 210: Fish early-life stage toxicity test. OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals. Paris, France. Development ELS tests were adapted from full life-cycle toxicity tests, chronic tests that expose an organism to a contaminant for its entire life-cycle. These are widely considered to be the best tests for estimating long-term \\"safe\\" concentrations of toxicants in aquatic organisms. The first full life-cycle tests on fish were developed for the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas),Mount DI, Stephan CE. 1967. A method for establishing acceptable limits for fish-Malathion and the butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D. Trans Am Fish Soc 96:185-193.Benoit DA, Puglisi FA, Olson DL. 1982.

Life-cycle toxicity test using sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus). Bioassay Procedures for the Ocean Disposal Permit Program, EPA-600/9-78-010. While useful, full life-cycle tests require a high number of test organisms and extensive exposure time in the lab, especially for vertebrates. Typically, life-cycle tests take 6–12 months for fathead minnow and 30 months for brook trout. Following the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the United States in 1976, there was an increased need for quicker, more efficient vertebrate toxicity tests. The EPA was now required to assess the environmental effects of new chemicals before they could be commercially produced. Less costly and time-intensive tests were needed to evaluate a multitude of new chemicals. Researchers began developing toxicity tests that focused on early life stages, since these have been shown to be more sensitive to environmental stressors than later life stages. Many critical events occur in a short period of time in the early stages of development.McKim JM. 1977. Evaluation of tests with early life stages of fish for predicting long-term toxicity. J Fish Res Board Can 34:1148–1154. If a stressor disrupts developmental events (including their timing), it could result in adverse effects that reduce the organism's chances of survival. Meta-analysis has found that early life-cycle portions of full life-cycle tests usually estimate an MATC within a factor of 2 of full life-cycle estimates in saltwater and freshwater fish. In 83% of 72 tests, the ELS portion resulted in the same MATC as the full life-cycle estimate, and the remaining 17% were within a factor of 2. Limitations There remain some limitations with early life stage toxicity testing. Although ELS tests are quicker and more cost-efficient than full life cycle tests, they remain resource- and time-intensive. Fish early life stage (FELS) tests require hundreds of fish and 1 to 5 months to complete.Villeneuve D, Volz DC, Embry MR, Ankley GT, Belanger SE, Léonard M, Schirmer K, Tanguay R, Truong L, Wehmas L. 2014. Investigating alternatives to the fish early-life stage test: a strategy for discovering and annotating adverse outcome pathways for early fish development. Environ Toxicol Chem 33:158-69. Other issues include the lack of mechanistic information, differing sensitivities between species, and insensitivity to parental exposure. ELS tests don't provide information on the toxicant's mechanism of action. Sensitivity to specific toxicants varies with species, so the most sensitive or most important species should be tested in each case. ELS tests appear to be insensitive to parental exposure, and MATCs are generally the same for embryos of both exposed and unexposed parents. This could be due to the mode of action of the toxicant or the variability and insensitivity of ELS test design. Additionally, growth response has been found to be an insensitive endpoint in ELS tests with fish, having little bearing on the estimation of an MATC.Woltering DM. 1984. The growth response in fish chronic and early life stage toxicity tests: A critical review. Aquat Toxicol 5:1–21. Growth response could be omitted to reduce the duration and cost of screening tests. Methodology In a typical early life stage toxicity test, a flow-through dilutor system administers different concentrations of a toxicant to different test chambers. At least five different concentrations of a toxicant are tested, plus controls, with at least two exposure chambers for each treatment. The length of the exposure depends on the test species. For example, fathead minnow tests are 1–2 months long, while brook trout tests are around 5 months long. Growth and survival are the typical endpoints, for which an MATC can be found.

An extended fish early-life stage test for oestrogenic active chemicals in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) Aquat Toxicol 77:279-290. Endocrine active chemicals (EACs) are ubiquitous in the environment, prompting the need for better screening assays to predict their effects, especially in aquatic species. Slightly longer ELS tests could be used instead of full life-cycle tests, taking into account sensitive windows of exposure like sexual differentiation and early gonadal development. Extended ELS tests have proven successful in detecting the effects of weak estrogens in fathead minnows. Additionally, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are being used to develop an alternative to FELS testing. Industry and regulatory agencies are increasingly interested in an animal-free, cost- efficient surrogate.Knapen D, Vergauwen L, Verstraelen S, Dardenne F, Witters H, Blust R, Villeneuve DL, Ankley GT. 2013.

It premiered on May 11, 2014 on Fox, and aired on May 12, 2014 on National Geographic Channel. The episode was directed by Bill Pope, and written by Ann Druyan and Steven Soter. The episode explores the Earth's magnetic field and the contributions of Michael Faraday (1791 – 1867), which paved the way for high technology and light-speed communication.  Episode summary  Michael Faraday presenting his experiments with electromagnetism at a Christmas Lecture, 1856 This episode provides an overview of the nature of electromagnetism, as discovered through the work of Michael Faraday. Tyson explains how the idea of another force of nature, similar to gravitational forces, had been postulated by Isaac Newton before. Tyson continues on Faraday, coming from poor beginnings, would end up becoming interested in studying electricity after reading books and seeing lectures by Humphry Davy at the Royal Institution. Davy would hire Faraday after seeing extensive notes he had taken to act as his secretary and lab assistant. After Davy and chemist William Hyde Wollaston unsuccessfully tried to build on Hans Christian Ørsted's discovery of the electromagnetic phenomena to harness the ability to create motion from electricity, Faraday was able to create his own device to create the first electric motor by applying electricity aligned along a magnet. Davy, bitter over Faraday's breakthrough, put Faraday on the task of improving the quality of high-quality optical glass, preventing Faraday from continuing his research. Faraday, undeterred, continued to work in the Royal Institution, and created the Christmas Lectures designed to teach science to children. Following Davy's death, Faraday returned to full time efforts studying electromagnetism, creating the first electrical generator by inserting a magnet in a coil of wires. Tyson continues to note that despite losing some of his mental capacity, Faraday concluded that electricity and magnetism were connected by unseen fields, and postulated that light may also be tied to these forces. Using a sample of the optical glass that Davy had him make, Faraday discovered that an applied magnetic field could affect the polarization of light passing through the glass sample (a dielectric material), leading to what is called the Faraday effect and connecting these three forces. Faraday postulated that these fields existed across the planet, which would later be called Earth's magnetic field generated by the rotating molten iron inner core, as well as the phenomena that caused the planets to rotate around the sun. Faraday's work was initially rejected by the scientific community due to his lack of mathematical support, but James Clerk Maxwell would later come to rework Faraday's theories into the Maxwell's equations that validated Faraday's theories. Their combined efforts created the basis of science that drives the principles of modern communications today. Episode title The Electric Boy, Essai sur l'electricité des corps, 1746 Faraday can be seen as an \\"electric boy\\" because of his electrical discoveries. Also, \\"The Electric Boy\\" was an experimental demonstration of static electricity popular in the eighteenth-century. A young man was suspended from the ceiling using insulating silk cords, and electrified, causing his body to act as a magnet. Objects were attracted to him, and close proximity of another person could lead to sparks.  Reception  The episode received a 1.1/3 in the 18-49 rating/share, with 3.46 million American viewers watching on Fox.

The by- election resulted from the resignation of the previous member Colin Moyle after accusations against him in parliament, and he was replaced by David Lange, also of the Labour Party. Apart from Lange, there were seven other candidates in the by-election. Candidates =Labour= Initially, there was media supposition that Moyle would stand again to vindicate himself from Muldoon's allegations and that he would not be opposed for selection. However several people did nominate though they were without name recognition. As Mangere was a safe Labour seat, there was a large amount of interest. Eventually there were four former Labour MPs in the race and Moyle decided to withdraw his nomination on 12 February only three days before the selection meeting. This led Labour's Auckland President Barry Gustafson to call for nominations to be re-opened, however Labour Party general secretary John Wybrow refused. With Moyle out, former MPs Dorothy Jelicich and Mike Moore became the favourites, with both Moyle and Labour leader Bill Rowling supporting Jelicich. In the end a mammoth total of 16 candidates were nominated: *Gerrard Beeson, former Mayor of Onehunga *Brian Edwards, a Manukau City Councillor *Kelly Flavell, local lawyer *Ken Hastings, Secretary of Labour's Auckland Regional Council *George Hawkins, Chairman of the branch *Harriet Hussey, Secretary of the Grey Lynn branch *Dorothy Jelicich, former MP for *David Lange, who was Labour's candidate for in 1975 *Nigel Mercer, Chairman of the branch *Mike Moore, former MP for *Brian Nicholson, member of the Manukau East branch *Ian Shaw, Secretary of the Riverside branch *Elsa Smith, Chair of the Grey Lynn women's branch *Rex Stanton, a Takapuna City Councillor and Labour's candidate for in 1975 *Charles Turner, Chairman of the branch *Ron Ng-Waishing, a former member of the Labour Party executive and candidate for in 1975 In addition to Moyle, several candidates pulled out of the nomination process; Malcolm Douglas unsuccessful Labour nominee for in 1975, Geoff Braybrooke Labour's candidate for in 1975 and Murray Smith former MP for . The candidates were narrowed down to a shortlist three Jelicich, Lange and Moore. The local members preferred Moore whilst the Labour Party head office favoured Jelicich resulting in Lange being selected as a compromise candidate. Lange, a criminal defence lawyer, was relatively unknown in political circles and his selection was something of a surprise. He was an unsuccessful candidate on the Labour ticket for the Auckland City Council at the 1974 local elections and had stood for parliament in in 1975, placing third. =National= Four candidates sought the National Party nomination: *Colin Bidois, a sports shop proprietor and Manukau City Councillor since 1968 *Stanley Lawson, a book retail manager and member of the Auckland Power Board, National's candidate in 1972 and 1975 *Clem Simich, a builder and former police detective-sergeant, deputy chairman of National's executive *Brian Slater, a pilot and Waitemata City Councillor, former vice-chair of National's executive (1964–1967) Simich won the selection. Simich was noted as being well presented but misjudging the nature of the Mangere electorate. His policies were largely conservative and he drove around in a Rolls-Royce followed by several other glamorous cars in a motorcade which jarred with the lower-middle class nature of the locals. =Others= The incipient Values Party chose their 1975 candidate Frank Grayson once again. Barry Moss, an unsuccessful candidate for in 1969 stood as a \\"Worker's Labour\\" candidate. Bill Owens was the candidate for the Social Credit Party who had contested the Mangere seat in 1975. Barry Shaw ran as an independent labour candidate and Brigid Mulrennan stood for the Socialist Action Party, both had contested in 1975. Campaign Most of the campaigning was conducted by candidates hosting public meetings, most of which were well attended. Labour leader Bill Rowling spoke at several meetings in Lange's support as did several other MPs. In one noted occasion a heckler at a workplace meeting was chased across a nearby paddock by MP Mick Connelly. There was also a live televised debate between Lange and Simich which, despite being a local contest, was broadcast nationwide. Lange performed well and won the debate, giving him much publicity on the national stage. Results The following table gives the election results: Aftermath The by-election put Lange into parliament, and the attention that he got helped propel him to the deputy leadership of the parliamentary Labour Party in 1979 and the leadership itself in February 1983, and then a landslide victory over Muldoon in the 1984 general election. As Labour's majority was larger than expected Lange spent most of his first few weeks as an MP supporting Labour's candidate in the 1977 Pahiatua by-election, Allan Levett, attempt to increase their vote share. Moyle stood as Labour's candidate in in 1978 and would re-enter parliament in 1981 as MP for .

He was also a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University in 1850. He was born at Ottery St Mary, Devon and died at South Kensington, London. Background and education Arthur Coleridge was the son of Francis Coleridge and the great-nephew of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He was educated at Eton College where he played in the cricket team, hitting the winning runs in the 1847 Eton v Harrow match at Lord's. Matriculating at King's College, Cambridge in February 1849, Coleridge played a single first- class cricket match at Cambridge, scoring 1 and 17 when opening the batting against Marylebone Cricket Club. It is not known if he batted right- or left- handed. Legal career Coleridge became a Fellow at King's College before becoming a lawyer, being called to the bar in 1860. He went into the administrative side of the English legal system and served as Clerk of Assize for the Midland Circuit for 37 years up to his death: he was taken ill while officiating at Lincoln Assizes and returned immediately to London just two days before his death. It was reported that he did not miss a single assizes session over his 37 years in post. Music Coleridge was at the centre of British musical life for many years, and his home for many years at 12, Cromwell Place, South Kensington, became a meeting place for many of the leading musicians of the day.Keen, Basil. The Bach Choir: The First Hundred Years p 13 (2008) He was himself an amateur tenor with a voice \\"of great power and dramatic quality\\" and \\"was one of the few amateurs who could speak with professionals\\" on equal terms. At Cambridge, he was a friend of Thomas Attwood Walmisley, the influential organist at Trinity College and from 1836 professor of music at Cambridge; he was later closely associated with William Sterndale Bennett, Walmisley's successor as professor of music at Cambridge and later director (and reviver) of the Royal Academy of Music. Coleridge's singing and his friendships brought him into contact with the Royal Academy of Music piano professor Otto Goldschmidt and his wife, the Swedish soprano Jenny Lind, and it was through these connections that the idea for a London performance of J. S. Bach's Mass in B Minor was hatched: the Mass had been performed in full for the first time only in Leipzig in 1859. With backing from his friends, Coleridge organized the first performance in England, at St James's Hall on 26 April, 1876.Pardee, Katherine. The B-minor Mass in 19th Century England (2013) \\"Having worked the organization, and seen it through, he, with the modesty which was characteristic of him, left others to reap the credit,\\" his obituarist in The Times in 1913 wrote. He was also the founder of the Bach Choir in 1865 and of the UK version of the Mendelssohn Scholarship whose first recipient was the young Arthur Sullivan. Unlike Sterndale Bennett, whose devotion to Mendelssohn led him to reject later composers such as Schumann and Brahms, Coleridge was an enthusiastic promoter of new music and very catholic in his tastes. He knew Liszt, Rossini and the now-obscure but prolific Ferdinand Hiller personally, and promoted the works of Schumann, Brahms and Wagner. He was a friend of the Hungarian violinist Joseph Joachim. In later life, he lectured on the lives and works of the composers and performers he had known. Writing Coleridge's involvement with German music led him into translation work: he translated the first significant biography of the composer Franz Schubert by Heinrich Kreissle von Hellborn (Vienna, 1865), and the Life of Moscheles from his diary entries by Moscheles' wife Charlotte. He also translated the Goethe play Egmont which inspired one of Beethoven's popular overtures. In the 1890s, he wrote a book of reminiscence and anecdote about his schooldays called Eton in the Forties. The music critic J A Fuller Maitland completed and edited his Reminiscences in 1921.Fuller Maitland, J.A., ed., 1921: Arthur Coleridge, Reminiscences Coleridge's daughter Mary Coleridge was a published poet and novelist: her entry in the Dictionary of National Biography indicates that Coleridge's circle of friendship extended beyond musicians to include literary figures such as Alfred Tennyson and Robert Browning, as well as painters such as John Millais.

This version was painted in oil and gold (possibly tempura) by Spanish Archbishop Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña in 1480.Schiller, Gertrud, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, Print. It currently resides in the San Francisco Legion of Honor.  Historical background  Pope Gregory I was Pope of Rome in the 6th century, and was most known for his writings like the Gregorian Chart. He is commonly credited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him.John N.D. Kelly, The Oxford Dictionary of Popes, Oxford University Press, 1986. Print. In the scene, Pope Gregory I is seen saying mass at an altar. The story behind the scene goes that to convince a doubter who did not believe that transubstantiation made bread into the body of Christ, Pope Gregory prays to God and the host turned into a bloody finger. In the popular 13th century compilation the Golden Legend this story is retained, but other versions vary and the finger is changed into a visionary appearance of the whole of Christ on the altar, and the doubter becomes one of the deacons.Rubin, Miri, Corpus Christi: The Eucharist in Late Medieval Culture, pp. 120–122, 308-310, Cambridge University Press, 1992, Print. In this painting, Jesus as a whole appears on the altar, solidifying the concept of transubstantiation even more. This image has strong association with the idea of the sale of indulgences, and at times, this image was even coupled with specific indulgences that were granted to those who said prayers in its presence.Rubin, Miri, Corpus Christi: The Eucharist in Late Medieval Culture, pp. 120–122, 308-310, Cambridge University Press, 1992, Print. In this painting Jesus is emerging from his tomb, but other times it is just his body.  Artwork  The use of gold can be noted throughout the painting, its holy appeal is used as a halo around Jesus, on the robes and crown of the pope, and on the chalice upon the altar.Schiller, Gertrud, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, Print. It is believed that this leaves reference to the divine connection between God and the papacy, as well as to the divine transformation that takes place in the chalice during transubstantiation. The Pope and the two cardinals are placed in the foreground, looking up at Jesus above them, and images of his betrayal and crucifixion in the background. The painting is full of “Arma Christi”. The image above Jesus, wherein he is kissing another man, represents the betrayal of Judas upon Jesus’ arrest. The black rooster represents how the disciple Peter would deny association with Jesus “three times before the cock crows”, after Jesus’ arrest. The red coin purse represents the pieces of silver that Judas accepted in return for his betrayal of Jesus. The whip and the white pillar with the rope around it represents the 40 lashings Christ received by the Romans at the Scourging at the Pillar.Schiller, Gertrud, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, Print. Besides all of these smaller symbols in the background, Jesus himself is a symbol for the effect of transubstantiation. In the top section, a face can be seen on a hanging cloth, this could be a reference to one of the Acheiropoieta images like the Shroud of Turin.  Patronage  Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña was a Spanish politician and Roman Catholic archbishop. He descended from a noble Portuguese family, meaning that he was in the aristocratic class and chose to enter the clergy. He was educated by his uncle who was a Cardinal, and later became an influential figure in the royal court of John II of Castile.Guillermo Mireki, Apuntes genealógicos y biográficos de don Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña, Arzobispo de Toledo, Anales Toledanos vol. XXVIII, Instituto de Estudios Toledanos, Toledo, 1991 (pp. 55–76). While the patronage for this painting is not given, it can be inferred that the artwork produced by Archbishop Alfonso Carrillo was supported by the Catholic Church, especially art like this which supported papal authority. It could also be inferred that Alfonso received patronage from John II of Castile, Henry IV and Isabella I. In his lifetime, Carrillo served under six Popes throughout his life, from Pope Eugene IV to Pope Sixtus IV. This span includes the papacy of Callixtus III, who was the first Spanish Pope.John N.D. Kelly, The Oxford Dictionary of Popes, Oxford University Press, 1986. Print. Carrillo was made protonotary apostolic by Pope Eugene IV, entering the royal court of John II of Castile. He was a hugely influential figure in the court of John II, Henry IV and with the Catholic Monarchs. He was made bishop of Sigüenza in 1436 then archbishop of Toledo in 1446. Carrillo acted as Queen Isabella’s main advisor and he played a major part in arranging her marriage to Ferdinand II of Aragon in October 1469.Guillermo Mireki, Apuntes genealógicos y biográficos de don Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña, Arzobispo de Toledo, Anales Toledanos vol. XXVIII, Instituto de Estudios Toledanos, Toledo, 1991 (pp. 55–76). Carrillo was alive during the reign of Emperor Frederick III of the Holy Roman Empire, but no interaction is mentioned.

It was also released as the B-side to the \\"Country Road\\" single. It has since been covered by other artists, including Stéphane Grappelli and Jerry Douglas. Composition and recording Taylor wrote \\"Sunny Skies\\" during his treatment at the Austen Riggs Center. The melody is cheerful, which is ironic given the lyrics. Taylor's biographer, Timothy White, describes the melody as \\"a deceptively upbeat, skiffle-flavored shuffle\\". The author Stephen Davis describes the song as \\"jazzy but disconsolate\\" and James Perrone compares the melody to John Sebastian's song \\"Daydream\\". Taylor accompanies himself on acoustic guitar. The title \\"Sunny Skies\\" actually does not refer to the condition of the sky, but to the title character of the song, who \\"sleeps in the morning\\", \\"weeps in the evening\\", \\"doesn't know when to rise\\" and has no friends. The last verse links the title character to the singer, who sings that he looks out of his own window to see snow and trees, and wonders if he should let the world pass him by, just like the title character. The singer, like Taylor himself at the time, wonders if his accomplishments were worth the suffering he went through to achieve them. Perrone also notes that, like the title character, Taylor had gone through a period where he was too depressed to get up in the morning. \\"Sunny Skies\\" was included on the 1990 version of the compilation album The Best of James Taylor. Taylor wrote the song before being released from his original Apple Records contract, and a demo version of \\"Sunny Skies\\" was included as a bonus track of the 2010 CD version of Taylor's first album James Taylor. Taylor played the song on 15 May 1980 for the 100th episode of Saturday Night Live. Cover versions * Stéphane Grappelli recorded \\"Sunny Skies\\" in the early 1970s for Pye Records. It was re-released along with other Grapelli recordings of the period on the 2002 album The Collection.

Bosnia faced many challenges during the war, including bombings throughout the country that ruined much of the infrastructure. Parallel regimes took over Bosnia and flipped the country upside down with land mines, bullets, and bombings. The war displaced over 800,000 refugees and killed over 100,000 people.\\"Bosnia-Herzegovina.\\" United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. United States Holocaust Memorial Council, n.d. Web. 09 May 2014. The war in Bosnia also consisted of an ethnic \\"cleanse\\" of Bosnian Muslims initiated by Bosnian Serbs, which included containment of Bosniaks in concentration camps. The war ended with NATO involvement and the Dayton Agreement in 1995. The Dayton Agreement acknowledges Bosnia and Herzegovina as a democratic country and the country is moving toward the basic principals that accompany that, such as civil rights and equality. During the war there was minimal attention given to the standard of health and major public health concerns, such as pest control, hygiene, disinfection, and import and export programs, were all interrupted or stopped.Cain, J. et al. In Cain, J. and Jakubowski, E., eds. Health care systems in transition: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Copenhagen, European Observatory on Health Care Systems, 4(7) (2002). The war affected Bosnia in many ways. The war torn country not only lost much of the infrastructure, but the economy and the governmental system were also affected. It is estimated that there are still thousands of people living as refugees and a large portion of the population still fall under the United Nations High Commission of Refugees category of a refugee or displaced person.Cain, J. et al. In Cain, J. and Jakubowski, E., eds. Health care systems in transition: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Copenhagen, European Observatory on Health Care Systems, 4(7) (2002). The shortcomings of the current health care system include the lack of communication between health care centers, lack of skills, and lack of standards that are uniform throughout the country.  Health issues  The war has resulted in lower socioeconomic statuses of Bosnia's citizens, raised new health concerns, caused epidemiological changes, and changed the focus of the community.\\"Strategic Plan for Health Care Development in The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Between 2008 and 2018.\\" BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA FEDERATION OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA FEDERAL MINISTRY OF HEALTH (2008): n. pag. National Planning Cycles. Web. 9 May 2014. . Some of the environmental factors that have had an effect on health include limited trash disposal sights, water shortages, and infrastructure destruction.Cain, J. et al. In Cain, J. and Jakubowski, E., eds. Health care systems in transition: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Copenhagen, European Observatory on Health Care Systems, 4(7) (2002). Smoking is a large problem, as well as increased drug and alcohol use after the war. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as other psychological traumas, have appeared in high numbers after the war. The war in Bosnia was different than other modern day wars in terms of the leading cause of death. It is usually the case that the leading cause of death for civilians is the outbreak of infectious disease, but in Bosnia and Herzegovina the leading cause of death was war-related trauma.Kunitz, Stephen. The Making and Breaking of Yugoslavia and Its Impact on Health. Am J Public Health. 2004 November; 94(11): 1894–1904. In 2015 it was estimated that 12.01% of the population has diabetes, costing about $523 per person per year. It had the fourth highest rate of male smokers in Europe - 47%. = Psychological traumas and disorders = The war resulted in increased numbers of psychological traumas and disorders. These can cause the individual to face problems in the workforce as well as their personal and family life, and can even lead to suicide.\\"Health Care in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Context of the Return of Refugees and Displaced Persons, Sarajevo.\\" UNHCR News. UNHCR Office of the Chief of Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2001. Web. 09 May 2014. Currently in Bosnia the psychiatric and neurologic departments are just one department, with no differentiation between the two. This can cause issues to arise between patients as well as a lack of specialization when it comes to treatment. Posttraumatic stress disorder is a rising disorder for the post-war country, yet there is very little treatment or focus on the disease. Most of the treatment is done through Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), who will eventually leave Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Problems  Some of the issues that Bosnia is currently facing in terms of bettering their health care system in order to address the rising health concerns includes the fact that there is not enough technical infrastructure and management capacity to cause change in the short term. There is also a weak regulatory process as well as a lack of communication between local and central levels of the health care system. The country is also still receiving aid from international sources that also lack coordination between international and local services and care; the two sources don't function as one but as two separate providers of care. According to some experts programs initiated by NGOs, United Nations, and NATO, to name a few, focused more so on long-term effects instead of focusing on long-term as well as short-term reforms. In many places programs focused on academic settings, for the betterment of medical knowledge and schools, before the people had access to basic public health needs, such as clean water.Simunovic, Vladimir J. \\"Health Care in Bosnia and Herzegovina Before, During, and after 1992–1995 War: A Personal Testimony.\\" Conflict and Health. BioMed, 2007. Web. 09 May 2014.  Reforms and programs  The Federation Health Program of 1994 was implemented as part of the reform process. This included a set of proposals by the Ministry of Health and created two new laws, the Law on Health Care and the Law on Health Insurance. The Law on Health Care focuses on the delivery of services and the family medicine model. The Law on Health Insurance insures each person receives a basic health care package regardless of income and resources available. A program launched by the National Research Council, called \\"Trauma and Reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina\\", focused on conducting research while including cross-cultural experience for American and Bosnian experts.Nelson, Briana S.(2003) 'Post-War Trauma and Reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Observations, Experiences, and Implications for Marriage and Family Therapy', The American Journal of Family Therapy, 31: 4, 305 — 316 The program organized meetings with professionals from a variety of organizations, including NGOs, children's homes, and women's organizations to gain a local perspective on what should be done to help address the rising health issues due to war caused trauma. They concluded that around 18%-38% of residents suffered from PTSD during or after the war. Other programs, such as those organized by Doctor's without Borders, Harvard Trauma Program for Refugees, and the International Center for Psychosocial Trauma by the University of Missouri-Columbia were all launched with an aim to help provide further education for family doctors when it came to trauma and psychological issues.Avdibegović, E., M.

Duckworth & Co.) The Nature of a Crime is a collaborative novel written and published in 1909 by authors Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford. The text did not acquire acclaim until after Conrad's death in 1924, when Ford brought the text to light in his essay \\"Joseph Conrad: A Personal Remembrance\\". The Nature of a Crime is the last of three books written by Conrad and Ford. Literary and historical context The text was written by Ford and Conrad in 1909, eight years after their earliest collaboration. Prior to the creation of this novel, Ford and Conrad shared an extensive working relationship, both as editors and co-authors. The two co-wrote The Inheritors in 1901, followed by Romance in 1903, and finally The Nature of a Crime in 1909. The two were introduced to one another by Edward Garnett, who wished Conrad would edit a text Ford had written in order to increase its likelihood of being published. The working relationship between the two was very helpful for each author in developing personal theories of the novel, the writing process, and the separation of the author from the narrator. Ford and Conrad's close work over the years also created a strong bond between the two, summarized in Ford's 1924 essay, \\"Joseph Conrad: A Personal Remembrance\\", published in The English Review. The Nature of a Crime is likely influenced by major events from the life of Joseph Conrad, most notably his suicide attempt made at the age of 20. In the novel, the narrator finds himself falling deeper into depression as a result of his mishandling of a close friend's trust fund, and is eventually pushed to the point of acceptance of suicide as the only viable option for him to rectify the situation. Conrad's real-life attempt on his life, while not well-documented, is reported to have been a result of falling into debt, similar to the narrator in his novel. The novel also references Tristan and Iseult, a medieval French tragedy about adulterous love. The novel's narrator mentions in one of his letters that he has gone to see a performance of the play. The influence of this traditional story is evident in the novel, as the narrator finds himself writing love letters to the wife of a friend - an action that the narrator acknowledges as improper, further adding to the storm of depression he experiences as a result of his personal actions. Plot summary This work is written in the form of a series of letters from a narrator, who remains nameless throughout the work, to a particular love interest, also left nameless. The narrator is employed as a lawyer, a fact deduced by his reference to his position of holding power of attorney over a few characters in the work. The crime for which he is responsible is that of gambling away money entrusted to him by one of his clients, Edward Burden, who is to be married some time within the occurrence of the novel's events. However, the conflict of the story is that Edward has no idea of the narrator's misuse of his funds, and that the funds are not so destroyed that Edward cannot withdraw what he needs in the short term. The bulk of the work details the internal struggles of the narrator to come to grips with the crime he has committed and for which he imminently will be indicted. His letters, while acting as a confession of his love for the unidentified married woman, also act as a device for him to express the otherwise concealed emotions with which he struggles in the daily process of figuring out how to deal with his situation. The narrator posits several theories about life, including man's relationship with “the omniscient,” or God; the ways in which men and women interact, and his opinions on female empowerment; and, most importantly, his opinions on suicide. At the start of the work, the narrator mentions frequently that his time on Earth is limited, and reveals later in the story that his intention is to commit suicide. For nearly an entire chapter, he details the moral implications and justifications of suicide, believing that his life has nothing left to offer, due to both the inability to be with the woman he loves and his impending sentence of indefinite imprisonment (another critical factor in setting his mind on suicide is his refusal to withstand imprisonment, which he cites as “the worst form of torture” because of the solitary existence of man with only his thoughts). The narrator plans to make his final living act the mailing of his letters to the woman, but the novel offers a rather comic ending to the story - as the narrator plans to die in some way on his way home, he experiences overwhelming marvel at the simplest occurrences of life (for example, a milk man delivering milk and being chased by a cat), and is granted “reprieve” from his situation in that Burden and his fiancée have planned a year-long honeymoon, granting the narrator time to remedy the accounts and set things straight. Main characters *Narrator - The protagonist of the novel, though his name is never revealed. His employment by the Burden family as their attorney opens him to using Edward's money to make personal investments, which cause him to drown deeper and deeper into debt that was incurred using someone else's money. The narrator is the author of the letters sent to a distant love interest, who also remains nameless throughout the text. Throughout his letters, he expresses emotion about his abuse of trust from the Burden family, and also offers theories on how men come to the point of suicide and various rationalizations for completing such an act. The narrator can easily be interpreted as a deific character, as his presence in the novel is known but not necessarily tangible. Edward Burden holds the narrator in very high esteem, despite his continual efforts to push that thought from Burden's mind. *Burden family - Alexander Burden and his wife (unnamed), parents of Edward, provide much of the context for the conflict in the novel. Their employment and eventual entrustment of Edward's bank accounts to the narrator create the bond between the two. When Alexander and his wife pass away, the narrator is left as the principal influential force in Edward's life. *Edward Burden - The most influential character on the events of the novel. The narrator has power of attorney over Edward, and Edward holds him in very high regard, almost to the point of a deity. The narrator acknowledges the level of respect Edward has for him, and adamantly disputes the validity of Edward's belief. Edward's persistent view of the narrator as a character of merit adds to the internal depression felt by the narrator as he decimates Edward's funds for his own use. *Miss Annie Averie - Edward's fiancée. While relatively minor in comparison to the primary relationships in the novel, Averies may serve as a point of discussion for the perception of women and gender roles in the early 20th century. Her relationship with Edward indicates a more 19th-century view of the male-female relationship, as Edward often tries to exert his authority and force her into subservience, at one point noting in conversation with the narrator that he had already begun \\"taming\\" her in preparation for their marital life. The narrator is, in his letters, often critical of Edward for his desire to hold total control over his fiancée, but never reveals these feelings to him directly. The narrator occasionally notes in his letters that he would cater to the \\"tiniest vanity\\" of Miss Averies - either asserting his legitimate belief in requiting the service and love of the woman in a relationship, or simply trying to further woo his love interest as he becomes increasingly desperate for her affection. Genre and style The Nature of a Crime is a collaborative text, written and edited jointly by both Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford, one of three such texts that exist. It is broken down into eight chapters, each detailing a day in which the narrator finds time to write another installment to his love interest (this being evidenced by the continual decrease in time until the narrator's death date in each section). While it could be considered a drama or crime-fiction work, the novel has a much more introspective framework after the initial frame of the crime is revealed. As the narrator writes more, the work focuses more and more on the internal conflicts, justifications, and rationalizations of a man set out to take his own life. The text, while written under a single voice, was edited extensively by both authors - as each of their individual introductions assert, the final work was influenced heavily by both, and written essentially in complete collaboration; that is, the work is a result almost entirely of conversation between both its authors. The novel focuses heavily on moral issues, a possible projection of the details of Conrad and Ford's conversations into the literary realm. As seen in other works, particularly written by Conrad, the subject matter of this novel delves deep into the recesses of the nature of man and the rationalization of action and thought, allowing the novel to almost transcend genre and be classified as an introspective work. Themes  The novel concerns itself primarily with internal issues of man, on a wide-ranging set of subjects. An overarching theme is that of death - as a man who, for almost the entirety of the novel, is doomed to die, the narrator offers several opinions on what it means to die, and why the idea of death satisfies him. He explains his reasonings on choosing death over imprisonment, calling himself a “man of action” (opposed to a “man of thought,” his other classification for people) - that death provides the basis for some new adventure something yet to have been experienced by man. As a man of experiences, he finds reason in excusing himself from an otherwise sinful act, being that nothing is known about truly experiencing death. The novel also details beliefs on gender relations in society. The narrator is highly critical of Edward Burden's treatment of his fiancée, Annie, noting frequently that she to him is some sort of beast to be tamed. The narrator criticizes Edward's attempt to simplify Annie's desires and beliefs, expressing in opposition that, were he to marry her, he would “try to find out what was her tiny vanity” (27) and see to it that she was satisfied in it. As this text was published (and most likely originally written) after the turn of the 20th century, these sentiments toward females may oppose earlier writings by Conrad and his 19th-century contemporaries - an expression of the change in opinion that all were capable of free thinking and were entitled to their own passions, regardless of prior social constructs. Overall, the novel presents the theme of moral discourse. In nearly each individual section, the narrator discusses a different facet of life affected by his present moral conflict. The narrator, while not necessarily holding faith in God, subscribes to the theory of asceticism, defined as “the doctrine that states one can achieve a high moral state by practicing self-denial or self-mortification.” This philosophy may justify his decision and argument that suicide is his best option - denial of the irredeemable nature of his crime and the act of suicide itself hint at his opinions throughout the novel that only through suicide will he be able to achieve the relinquishing of his earthly torment. Critical reception  Due to its posthumous publishing and relative insignificance in relation to other works by both authors, The Nature of a Crime has received very little scholarly examination. As the text is both fairly short in length and written by multiple authors, it poses difficulty to those looking to attribute certain characteristics to an author or in interpreting sections of text and their relation to the personal lives of the authors. Another struggle in critically interpreting the text is its epistemological nature - rather than creating a narrative about British or European imperialism as was popular at the time, this text is fairly modern in that it focuses entirely on the internal struggles of an individual as opposed to creating a detailed history of imperialism. One academic field in which this novel is found influential is that of the theory of writing and of the novel. Meyer's article, entitled The Nature of a Text refers to Conrad and Ford's work as \\"a fictive construct that stages writing as a self-reflexive textual act,\\" referencing the text as a landmark in that it implies the coexistence and co-occurrence of the actions of writing and reading. While very little critical reception of The Nature of a Crime exists, Joseph Conrad is one of the most celebrated authors of the late 19th and early 20th century, with significant interpretation and criticism of his other texts available. William Teignmouth Shore noted in his account of an interview with Conrad in the early 1900s that \\"it is almost impossible to entirely understand a man's work without knowing something of the man.\\"\\"The Academy and literature, 1904\\" Conrad's personality and history significantly influences the writing of this novel, both in the literal application of his debt and subsequent suicide attempt, and also in its subject matter - the deep, often introspective concepts discussed in the novel likely come from discussions Conrad had on those same subjects, especially with his co-author, Ford.

Scladina cave site  The Scladina cave is located on a hill to the right of the Meuse river bank, south-west of Sclayn village, being one of a number of caves in the middle Meuse river region, where significant paleontological discoveries were made as in the Spy Cave and the Lyell Cave. The caves in the area have been undergone systematic exploration since 1949. Scladina Cave was discovered in 1971 by cavers of the CAS (Archaeological Circle Sclaynois). In 1978 the Scientific Council of the Prehistory Department of the University of Liège began to direct the excavations. Since the site has yielded numerous artifacts of Mousterian Neanderthal origin, amidst assemblages of stone tools, bones and faunal remains. After the initially clearing of the entrance the excavations uncovered two strata of Neanderthal occupation, the oldest dating back 130,000 years. The sediments yielded artifacts and Mousterian stone tools, the earliest were attributed to the Middle Palaeolithic. The lithic industry of layer 5 is considered to be instrumental for a deeper understanding of the Mousterian settlements in the region and future studies might support the acquisition of a more accurate chronology and help to draw a more complete image of the contemporary environment of the site. The remarkably good state of preservation of the fossils, faunal remains and the sediments have the site allowed to become a point of reference in climatic evolution studies of Palaeolithic north-western Europe. Two Neanderthal occupation sites were identified, one dated to be 130,000 years old and the other 40,000 years. Modern humans infrequently occupied the site between 32,000 and 9,000 years ago and used the site as a burial place during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age between 5,300 and 2,000 years ago. Continued excavations since 1978 have produced a steady stream of findings that culminated in the discovery of the remarkable Sclayn child fossils in 1993. Sclayn cave site has been classified as a national heritage site of Wallonia on 27 May 2009 and is since open to the public.  Scladina Neanderthal child  Dated to be around 127,000 years old, the first fragment of the now nearly complete mandible, was found on 16 July 1993. A maxillary fragment and several teeth of the child were excavated in subsequent campaigns. A genetic sample was successfully extracted from one of the molars at a specific laboratory for ancient DNA and analyzed at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig.Journal reference: Tanya M. Smith, Michel Toussaint, Donald J. Reid, Anthony J. Olejniczak, Jean- Jacques Hublin, Rapid Dental Development in a Middle Paleolithic Belgian Neanderthal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA December 2007  Physiology and development  The child's DNA is one of the oldest to have been extracted from a Homo neanderthalensis fossil and has significantly contributed to the genetic mapping of the Neanderthal genome and the comparison with Homo sapiens. Initially it was suggested that the Scladina child was 2 to 4 years older than current estimates, based upon traditional assessments of the progressive dental development. Results of an international research collaboration allow the proposal that Homo neanderthalensis children had a faster rate of dental development than modern human children as well as other aspects of physical development were likely to be more rapid in juvenile Neanderthals, such as a quicker onset of sexual maturity and different and faster patterns of early cognitive development. The study further elaborates, that tooth development is related to overall physiological development, noticeable as the first molar eruption coincides - universally across the primate phylum - with the beginning of the weaning stage, whereas the upsurge of the third molar indicates the onset of sexual development. Some scholars, though debate universal periods of anterior tooth growth, as it is known that anterior tooth growth takes longer in great apes than in humans and varies among human populations. The study of the child turned out to support the idea that extremely prolonged duration of human development is unique to Homo sapiens and a relatively recent development in human evolution. Although the matter is still debated, the more rapid development apparent in Homo neanderthalensis children (wherein sexual onset may have occurred up to 4 years sooner) puts Neanderthal development patterns at a progressive stage in between modern Homo sapiens and that of earlier species, such as Homo erectus. This trend suggests to many scientists the necessary prevalence of differing patterns of behavioral and social development as well. A single tooth of another Neanderthal infant, also found at the site, was analysed by Christine Austin and Tanya Smith, whose analysis suggests that this particular child has received 7 months of breastfeeding and supplementation for additional 7 months, which adds up to roughly 14 months of breastfeeding. This cycle is indeed longer than that of some contemporary human cultures, which implies that Neanderthal children might have grown up faster, a process that began only after the stages of early infancy.  Behavior and tool use  Neanderthal diet consisted to over 70% of meat, unlike that of contemporary Homo sapiens hunter-gatherer societies., although some cooked vegetables are evident. Provisioning techniques, made superior by extensive tool use, aided early Homo in pursuits of worldwide expansion. One large game evident in the diets of Scladina Neanderthals is bear. Several bear bones were found amongst other stone tools and modifiers within the Scladina cave site. Wear marks on the bones, 4 of the 6 bear bone tools which originated from a single femur, exhibit abrasion traits that classify them as lithic retouchers. Public education The ASBL Archéologie Andennaise has established an educational mission in consequence of the prolonged, intense and insightful study of the site and the enormous implications of the acquired information and data. The idea is to correctly inform about prehistory, deemed to be still perceived as nebulous and mythical by the general public. The site and its documentation center are open to the public all year round. Private groups, school classes are permanently granted access to the cave, the laboratory, the museum gallery with multimedia program rooms, accompanied by the researchers and scientists themselves.

Tritrophic interactions, as they relate to plant defense against herbivory, describe the ecological impacts of three trophic levels on each other: the plant, the herbivore, and its natural enemies. They may also be called multitrophic interactions when further trophic levels, such as soil microbes, or hyperparasitoids (higher-order predators), are considered. Tritrophic interactions join pollination and seed dispersal as vital biological functions which plants perform via cooperation with animals. Predators, pathogens, and parasitoids that attack plant-feeding insects referred to as natural enemies in a tritrophic context; they can benefit plants by hindering the feeding behavior of the harmful insect. It is thought that many plant traits have evolved in response to this mutualism to make themselves more attractive to natural enemies. This enlisting of natural enemies functions to protect against excessive herbivory and is considered an indirect plant defense mechanism. Traits attractive to natural enemies can be physical such as in the cases of domatia and nectaries, chemicals, or in the case of induced plant volatile chemicals used by natural enemies to pinpoint a food source. There are also numerous other plant traits that influence the success of different natural enemies in controlling herbivores which still require further investigation. This article will discuss the chemistry by which plants attract natural enemies to kill plant herbivores; it will also illustrate the alternative morphological means by which plants attract natural enemies and will explain what value in understanding these interactions can have for humans.  Chemical mechanisms of enemy attraction  Plants universally produce secondary metabolites known as allelochemicals. These metabolites serve no purpose in basic metabolic processes rather they serve as mediators of interactions between a plant and its environment, often attracting, repelling, or poisoning insects. Not only this, they also aid in helping produce secondary cell wall components such as those produced via amino acid modification. In a tritrophic system, volatiles are readily produced into the air and are superior to surface chemicals in drawing foraging natural enemies from afar. Plants also produce root volatiles which will drive tritrophic interactions between below-ground herbivores and their natural enemies. A very small fraction of plant volatiles are detectable by humans which will give plants like basil, eucalyptus, and pine trees their distinctive odors. The mixture and ratios of individual volatiles emitted by a plant under given circumstances is referred to as a volatile profile (also referred to as synomones in the context of natural enemy attraction). These are highly specific to certain plant species and are detectable within several meters of the source. Predators and parasitoids exploit the specificity of volatile profiles to navigate the complex infochemical signals presented by plants in their efforts to locate a particular prey species. The production of volatiles is likely to be beneficial given two conditions: that they are effective in attracting natural enemies and that the natural enemies are effective in removing or impeding herbivores. However, volatile chemicals may not have evolved initially for this purpose as they play vital roles within- plant signaling, attracting pollinators, or repelling herbivores that dislike such odors. = Induced defenses = Jasmonic acid, a herbivore-induced plant volative (HIPV), helps to attract natural enemies of plant pests. When plants continuously release a baseline level of volatiles, these defenses are said to be constitutive. Upon an instance of herbivory, however, the plant may respond by considerably increasing its production of volatiles or by producing a new profile of volatiles. This plasticity is controlled by either the jasmonic acid pathway or the salicylic acid pathway, depending largely on the herbivore; these substances are often called herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Specifically, Jasmonic acid increases in concentration when plants are damaged and are responsible for inducing the transcription of enzymes that are necessary in secondary metabolite production pathways. In addition to its benefits in resistance and transcription, this hormone has been found to aid in the production of defensive proteins such as α - amylase inhibitors as well lectins. Since α - amylase has been known for having hydrolytic properties in its ability to break down starch, these inhibitory proteins prevent insects from properly breaking down starch. Contrastingly, lectins provide their own defense benefits for plants as they interfere with insect nutrient absorption as they bind to carbohydrates. Though volatiles of any kind have an attractive effect on natural enemies, this effect is stronger for damaged plants than for undamaged plants, perhaps because induced volatiles signal definitive and recent herbivore activity. The phenomenon of inducibility gives rise to the idea that plants are sending out a \\"distress call\\" to the third trophic level in times of herbivore attack. Natural enemies can distinguish between mechanical tissue damage, which might occur during a number of events other than herbivory, and damage that is the direct result of insect feeding behavior. The presence of herbivore saliva or regurgitant mediates this differentiation and the resulting chemical pathway leads to a significantly stronger natural enemy response than mechanical damage could. The reliability of HIPVs in broadcasting the location of prey means that for many foraging enemies, induced plant volatiles are more attractive than even the odors emitted by the prey insect itself. = Local and systemic signals = When herbivores trigger an inducible chemical defense pathway, the resulting HIPVs may be emitted from the site of feeding damage (local induction), or from undamaged tissues belonging to a damaged plant (systemic induction). For example, when an herbivore feeds on a single corn seedling leaf, the plant will emit volatiles from all its leaves, whether or not they too have been damaged. Locally induced defenses aid parasitoids in targeting their foraging behaviors to the exact location of the herbivore on the plant. Systemic defenses are less spatially specific and may serve to confuse the enemy once the source plant is located. A plant might employ both local and systemic responses simultaneously.  Morphological mechanisms of enemy attraction  = Domatia = A hairless foveole domatium in the leaf underside of Guioa acutifolia Natural enemies must survive long enough and respond quickly enough to plant volatiles in order to benefit the plant through predatory behavior. Certain plant structures, called domatia, can selectively reinforce mutualisms with natural enemies and increase the fitness benefit they receive from that mutualism by ensuring the survival and proximity of natural enemies. Domatia provide a kind of housing or refuge for predators from both abiotic stressors, such as desiccation, and biotic stress, such as predation from higher-order predators. Therefore, they ensure not only better survival, but eliminate the time required for natural enemies to locate and travel to the damaged plant. For this reason, natural enemies that make use of domatia are often said to serve as \\"bodyguards\\" for the plant in or on which they live. Domatia may be as well-developed as acacia tree thorns, or as simple and incidental as a depression or crevice in a leaf stem, but they are distinguishable from galls and other similar structures in that they are not induced by the insect but formed constitutively by the plant. = Nutritional rewards = Plants are able to determine what types of herbivore species are present, and will react differently given the herbivore's traits. If certain defense mechanisms aren't effective, plants may turn to attracting natural enemies of herbivore populations. For example, wild tobacco plants use nicotine, a poison to defend against herbivores. However, when faced with nicotine-tolerant herbivores, they will attract the natural enemies of serious herbivores. As long as the natural enemies have some potential to be omnivorous, plants can provide food resources to encourage their retention and increase the impact they have on herbivore populations. This potential, however, can hinge on a number of the insect's traits. For example, hemipteran predators can use their piercing- sucking mouthparts to make use of leaves, stems, and fruits, but spiders with chelicerae cannot. Still, insects widely considered to be 100% carnivorous have recently been observed to diverge from expected feeding behavior. Some plants simply tolerate a low level of herbivory by natural enemies for the service they provide in ridding the plant of more serious herbivores. Others, however, have structures thought to serve no purpose other than attracting and provisioning natural enemies. These structures derived from a long history of coevolution between the first and third trophic levels. A good example is the extrafloral nectaries which many myrmecophytes and other angiosperms sport on leaves, bracts, stems, and fruits. Nutritionally, extrafloral nectaries are similar to floral nectaries, but differ as they do not encourage the visiting insect to come into contact with pollen at any point. Their existence is therefore not the product of a pollinator-plant mutualism, but rather a tritrophic, defensive interaction.  Human uses  Companion planting controls pests partly by favouring natural enemies. Systemic acquired resistance Plants have shown they have the ability to build resistance to pathogens after initial infection. This ability is called systemic acquired resistance and comes to fruition after a plant has been infected by a pathogen. After surviving infection, the plant contains increased amounts of defense compounds such as chitinases. The increased presence of these defense compounds have shown to help prevent the plant from being affected again. Studies have shown that plants contain the ability to pass this resistance to their progeny. An example of systemic acquired resistance was shown in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which the plants were exposed to fitness reducing levels of the bacterial disease PstDC3000. After exposure, the subsequent 1st generation progeny of the diseased plant exhibited increase resistance to the disease PstDC3000. Exploitation of tritrophic interactions has the capacity to directly benefit agricultural systems. Significant biocontrol of crop pests can be exerted by the third trophic level, given an adequate population of natural enemies. The widespread use of pesticides or Bt crops can undermine natural enemies’ success. In some cases, entire populations of predators and parasitoids are decimated, necessitating even greater use of insecticide because the ecological service they provided in controlling herbivores has been lost. Even when pesticides are not widely used, monocultures cannot support natural enemies in great enough numbers for them to have any impact on pest populations. A lack of diversity in the first trophic level is usually linked to low abundance in the third because alternative resources are missing from the system that are necessary for stable, large natural enemy populations. Enemy diets can be subsidized by increasing landscape diversity through companion planting, border crops, cover crops, intercropping, or allowing some weed growth. When nectar or other sugar-rich resources are provided, the natural enemy population thrives. = Biological control =  Morphological plant characteristics and natural enemy success  A dramatic example of plant trichomes (glandular) found on Drosera hartmeyerorum Beyond domatia and nutritional rewards, there are numerous other plant characteristics that are involved in the successful colonization of natural enemies on plants. These can include the physical size, shape, density, maturity, colour, and texture of a given plant species. Specific plant features such as the hairiness or glossiness of vegetation can have mixed effects on different natural enemies. For example, trichomes decrease hunting efficiency in many natural enemies, as trichomes tend to slow or prevent movement due to the physical obstacles they present or due to the adhesive secretions they produce. However, this is not the case for all natural enemies. For example, E. formosa, a whitefly parasitoid is slowed by plant hairs which allows the parasitoid to detect and parasitize a higher number of juvenile whiteflies. Trichomes not only benefit the plant physically, but also chemically. Trichomes can develop in a variety of forms including, hairs or as pocket-like structures called glandular trichomes. These glandular trichomes store species-specific secondary metabolites such as terpenoids and phenolics in a pocket like structure between the cell wall and the cuticle of the plant. When glandular trichomes burst upon contact, they release these secondary metabolites and the strong odor and bitter taste of these substances cause insect herbivores to repel. An example of trichomes used as a chemical defense against herbivores are found in the leaves of Urtica dioica. These leaves contain needle-like trichomes filled with a mix of histamine, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, formic acid, and serotonin which cause severe inflammation and irritation. These trichomes have a glassy looking tip which snaps off when it comes to contact with an herbivore and the needle-like trichome acts as a syringe, injecting the cocktail of histamines and acids into the skin. Studies have shown that trichome morphology and chemical composition has a role in herbivory response. The response of insect Helicoverpa sea on tomato plants Rutgers and Alisa Craig as well as their respective mutants was monitored in a study conducted by Donglan and his colleagues. They found a higher insect resistance on Alisa Craig, its mutant, and Rutger tomato plants treated with methyl jasmonate, a jasminate rich chemical which induces trichrome growth. There was low insect resistance on Rutger mutants which were also treated with methyl jasmonate. An adjacent study tested the trichome morphology of these four tomato plants and it was determined that Alisa Craig, its mutant and Rutger wild type tomato plants are rich in glandular trichomes while Rutger mutants are rich in non-glandular trichomes. Overall, this study suggests that glandular trichome density is an important factor of insect resistance. Trials involving Coccinelids have illustrated that many of these beetles have a distinct preference for the type of leaf surface they frequent. Presented with the opportunity to land on glossy or normal Brassica oleracea foliage, the beetles preferred inhabiting the glossy foliage as they were better able to grasp to these leaves. With this knowledge, many studies have been and are being conducted which evaluate the variation in effect on natural enemies when different plant genotypes are introduced.  Volatile organic compounds  Two potential aspects that benefit plants when they release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the deterring of herbivores and the attraction of natural enemies; the latter has been a source of much research, investigating the relationship between natural enemies and VOCs as well as the resulting biological control. There is the potential for synthesizing products which replicate the unique VOC composition released by different plants; these products could be applied to plants suffering from pests that are targeted by the attracted natural enemy. This could cause natural enemies to enter crops that are occupied by pest populations that would otherwise likely remain undetected by the natural enemies. The four elements that must be considered before manipulating VOCs are as follows: The VOCs must effectively aid the natural enemy in finding the prey; the pest must have natural enemies present; the fitness cost of potentially attracting additional herbivores must be exceeded by attracting enough natural enemies; and the natural enemies must not be negatively affected by direct plant defenses that may be present.  Extrafloral nectaries  A pair of extrafloral nectaries secreting nectar from a Passiflora edulis leaf In a recent study comparing wild, cultivated, and nectarless cotton varieties in both the field and greenhouse, the findings demonstrated that the level of domestication of cotton plants correlates to the level of indirect defense investment, observed in the form of EFNs. It showed that wild varieties produced higher volumes of nectar and attracted a wider variety of natural enemies. This research points towards the idea that the process of breeding new cotton varieties has overlooked natural resistance traits in the pursuit of high yielding varieties that can be protected by pesticides. While this study did not find clear relationships between pest suppression and level of cotton domestication, it did highlight several studies which have shown this relationship. The studies illustrated a significant correlation between plants bearing EFNs and lower pest levels along with greater levels of natural enemies. One study also showed that the feeding of herbivores can directly induce nectar production.These collective findings illustrate the potential benefits that could be gained through incorporating the desirable genetics of wild varieties into cultivated varieties.  Domatia  Certain tropical plants have been observed hosting colonies of ants in their hollow domatia and providing the ants with nutrition delivered from nectaries or food bodies. These ant colonies have become dependent on the host plants for their survival and, therefore, actively protect the plant; this protection can take the form of killing or warding off pests, weeds, and certain fungal pathogens. Chinese citrus farmers have capitalized on this mutualistic relationship for many years by incorporating artificial ant nests into their crops to suppress pests.  Parasitoids  A Brazilian parasitoid wasp raising it's ovipositor. Parasitoids have successfully been incorporated into biological pest control programs for many years. It has been demonstrated that plants can directly influence the effect of parasitoids on herbivores by releasing chemical cues which alter host-seeking behavior and by providing food sources or domatia. Certain parasitoids may be dependent on this plant relationship. Therefore, in production areas where parasitoid presence is desired, ensuring the crops being grown meet all of these requirements will likely correlate to higher parasitoid populations and potentially increased pest control. Parasitized aphids with visible parasitoid wasp exit holes. This has been illustrated through monitoring aphid populations in an experimental sugar beet crop. When only beets were grown, the parasitism level of the aphid population was insignificant. However, when collard crops were grown simultaneously and adjacent to the sugar beets, aphid parasitism levels increased. Collard crops released much higher concentrations of VOC’s compared to the sugar beets. As a result, it was found that the companion collard plants provided stronger chemical cues than the sugar beets. They attracted more aphid parasitoids which killed aphids in the collard plants and then migrated to the sugar beets that were in close proximity. In a related study, rice plants were observed to release ethylene and other compounds in response to brown plant hopper feeding, and this can attract a facultative parasitoid that parasitizes brown plant hopper eggs. In another study, it was shown that the presence of plant extraforal nectaries in cotton crops caused parasitoids to spend more time in them and caused the parasitization of more moth larva compared to cotton crops with no nectaries. Since the publication of this study, most farmers have transitioned to growing cotton varieties with nectaries. In a separate trial involving cotton, it was revealed that naturalized cotton emitted seven times the VOC’s compared to cultivated cotton varieties when experiencing feeding damage. This could be the case for other highly cultivated crop plants but must be measured, as there are cases of other crops that do not show the same trend. These findings reveal the specific variables a farmer can manipulate to influence parasitoid populations and illustrate the potential impact parasitoid habitat management can have on pest control. In the case of cotton and other similar high VOC crop scenarios, there is interest in genetically engineering the chemical pathways of cultivated varieties to selectively produce the high VOC’s that were observed in the naturalized varieties in order to attract greater natural enemy populations. This presents numerous challenges but could produce promising pest control opportunities.  Insect pathogens  A fly infected by a cordyceps entomopathogenic fungi with fruiting body structures present Insect pathogens, also called entomopathogens, are another group of organisms that are influenced by plants. The extent of the influence largely depends on the evolutionary history shared between the two as well as on the pathogens' method of infection and survival duration outside of a host. Several studies have shown that different insect host plants contain various compounds which cause different levels of insect mortality when certain entomopathogens are simultaneously injected. In some cases, significant increases in mortality are recorded, up to 50-fold in some studies. However, other research reveals that certain plants influence entomopathogens in negative ways, reducing their efficacy. It is primarily the leaf surface of the plant that influences the entomopathogen; plants can release various exudates, phytochemicals, and alleolochemicals through their leaves, some of which have the ability to inactivate certain entomopathogens. In contrast, in other plant species, leaf characteristics can increase the efficacy of entomopathogens. For example, the mortality of pea aphids was higher in the group of aphids that were found on plants with fewer wax exudates compared to plants with more wax exudates. This reduced waxiness increased the transmission of Pandora neoaphidus conidia from the plant to the aphids. Feeding-induced volatiles that are emitted by different plants have been shown to increase the amount of spores released by certain entomopathogenic fungi, increasing the likelihood of infection of some herbivores but not others. Plants can also influence pathogen efficacy indirectly, and this typically occurs either by increasing the susceptibility of the herbivore hosts or by changing their behavior. This influence can often take the form of altered growth rates, herbivore physiology, or feeding habits. This research illustrates the differential impact that various host plant species can have on entomopathogenic interactions. In one study, it was shown that Brassicas can defend themselves by acting as a vector for entomopathogens. It was shown that virus-infected aphids feeding on the plants introduced a virus into the phloem. The virus was passively transported in the phloem and was carried throughout the plant. This caused the aphids that were feeding in separate locations from the infected aphids to become infected as well. This finding presents the possibility of injecting crops with compatible entomopathogenic viruses to defend against susceptible insect pests.  Systemic acquired resistance  Plants have shown they have the ability to build resistance to pathogens after initial infection. This ability of plants to build a resistance to infection is called systemic acquired resistance and comes to fruition after a plant has been infected by a pathogen. After surviving infection, the plant contains increased amounts of defense compounds such as chitinases. The increased presence of these defense compounds have shown to help prevent the plant from being affected again. Studies have also shown that plants contain the ability to pass this resistance to their progeny. An example of systemic acquired resistance was shown in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which the plants were exposed to fitness reducing levels of the bacterial disease PstDC3000. After exposure, the subsequent first-generation progeny of the diseased plant exhibited increase resistance when exposed to the disease PstDC3000. In this study, while increased resistance for the disease PstDC3000 was found, it is important to note that the progeny had an increased susceptibility to a necrotrophic fungus called Alternaria brassicicola. The progeny also had a decreased response to the hormone jasmonic acid.  Below-ground tritrophic interactions  Less studied than above-ground interactions, but proving to be increasingly important, are the below-ground interactions that influence plant defense. There is a complex network of signal-transduction pathways involved in plant responses when they are receiving various stimuli, and it has been shown that soil microbes have a significant influence on a number of these responses. Certain soil microbes can aid plant growth, producing increased tolerance to various environmental stressors, and can protect their host plants from many different pathogens by inducing systemic resistance. It is understood that organisms in above- and below-ground environments can interact indirectly through plants. Many studies have shown both the positive and negative effects that one organism in one environment can have on other organisms in the same or opposite environment, with the plant acting as the intermediary between the two. A mycorhizal association with a plant root A meta analysis documenting the effect of mycorhizae demonstrated this. The colonization of plant roots with mycorhizae typically results in a mutualistic relationship between the plant and the fungus, inducing a number of changes in the plant. The analysis reviewed the mixed impact that colonization can have on herbivores; it highlighted that insects with different feeding methods were affected very differently, some positively and others negatively. The type of mycorhizae species involved also had a notable impact on the performance of the insects. One common species, Glomus intradices, had a negative effect on the feeding success of chewing herbivores, whereas other species studied had positive effects. One study showed that the roots of some maize plants produce a defense chemical when roots are damaged by leaf beetle larvae; this chemical was very attractive to the entomopathogenic nematode species Heterorhabditis megidis. It was found that only certain maize varieties produce this chemical; in the field, plants which released the chemical caused up to a five-fold increase in leaf beetle larvae parasitization over those that didn't produce the chemical. Incorporating these varieties or their genes into commercial maize production could significantly increase the efficacy of nematode treatments. Expanding on this study, in a further experiment, additional nematodes, herbivores and plant species were compared in order to record resulting interactions. The underlying findings suggested that the plant-emitted chemicals acted as the primary source of attractant to the nematodes. It was suggested that the herbivores have evolved to be relatively undetectable to the nematodes, whereas the plants have evolved to release highly attractive chemical signals. It is clear that a high degree of specificity is involved; species that make up these tritrophic interactions have evolved closely with one another over a long period of time and as a result have very unique relationships. An additional experiment showed that the bacterium E. aerogenes produces the volatile 2,3-butanediol which had impacts on interactions between plants, pathogens, and insects. When maize plants were grown in a soil culture containing the volatile bacterium or inoculated with the bacterium in its plant mass, researchers found that the maize were more resistant to the pathogen Setosphaeria turcica as there was a significant decrease in neurotic development and hyphae length when compared to bacteria absent maize. Furthermore, researchers found that the bacterium did not deter insect herbivory, rather it increased weight gain and leaf consumption in a caterpillar species known as Spodoptera littoralis . Lastly, when observing the attraction of a natural predator known as Cotesia marginiventris researchers found that these wasps were attracted more readily to maize plants that were grown in soil cultures containing either volatile producing bacterium or pure 2,3-butanediol. These results confirm the idea that soil microorganism does play a role in influencing tritrophic interactions between plants and insects.  Considerations in utilizing tritrophic interactions in biological control  Sustainable crop production is becoming increasingly important, if humans are to support a growing population and avoid a collapse of production systems. While the understanding and incorporation of tritrophic interactions in pest control offers a promising control option, it is important to note that the sustainable biological control of pests requires a dynamic approach that involves diversity in all of the species present, richness in natural enemies, and limited adverse activity (i.e., minimal pesticide use). This approach is especially important in conservation biological control efforts. It is also important to note that there are typically more than three trophic levels at play in a given production setting, so it has been suggested that the tritrophic interaction research model is somewhat simplistic and should, in some cases, incorporate the influence that higher trophic levels can have on biological control. Furthermore, ecological complexity and interactions between species of the same trophic level are topics that still require much research. Up to this point, the research has had a relatively narrow focus, which may be suitable for controlled environments such as greenhouses but which is lacking in its documentation of multi-generational plant interactions with dynamic communities of organisms.

Although Mendelsohn eventually abandoned this later project, an example of the designs from the series of paintings that Carlsund had prepared for the Einstein Library - the suite Rapidité - was realized in a mural at the Stockholm restaurant Parkrestaurangen Lilla Paris, in connection with the Stockholm Exhibition in 1930.

Pruniers airfield was part of a huge depot built for the Air Service, United States Army during World War I as an aircraft engineering facility. After the Armistice, the airfield stayed operational, with a French Air Force depot built in 1934. The airfield is slightly widened during World War II by the German Luftwaffe, but not much used. It returned to French control in September 1944, still as a depot. Overview DA 273 is primarily a logistics base for repairing aircraft by maintaining warehouses of spare parts. It is also a center for printing and issuing the technical documentation for the French Air Force. It also operates a small grass airfield as center for glider pilot training. It has a worldwide reputation as the gliding training site for the air Air Force for national and international competitions.DA 273 Romorantin The base employs approximately 650; half of the workforce are civilian personnel. History The first aviation use of Romorantin was in 1911, when a professor at the Collège Maurice Genevoix in Romorantin set up a \\"Society pour le Développement de l'Aéronautique\\". On 3 June 1911, the new society organized the demonstration of a Blériot Aéronautique monoplane which was flown for eight and one-half minutes from the military training and firing range of \\"La Butte\\". After the flight, the crowd went wild and the Mayor offered champagne. After a second flight, this aviation event remained deeply marked in local annals. According to the elected officials at the time, there were more than 10,000 people in attendance at the demonstration. History of Romorantin Air Base (in French) On 31 March 1912, the city council received a letter from the Ligue National Aéronautique (an aviation lobbying association whose president was Georges Clemenceau) suggesting that some land be provided for an airfield. With the help of the LNA, a \\"station aéronautique\\" is set on the military range of La Butte, one miles out of Romorantin, on the road leading to the futur Pruniers airfield, with one hangar at the edge of the field; the new aerodrome was inaugurated in June 1913. No civil aircraft were permanently based as the station was mostly designed to bring shelter for passing aircraft: in 1913, during military manoeuvres, some French Aeronautique Militaire's planes landed at the airfield, on a stop-over to Limoges. =World War I = From 1915, the \\"La Butte\\" airfield was often used by the trainer aircraft from the Avord air school; it was event projected for a time to built a flying school on the airfield. With the construction of the American depot at Pruniers, the \\"old\\" airfield was abandoned and used to store disused aircraft. In early 1917, after the entry of the United States into the war, the site of Pruniesr was chosen over eight others for use by the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Forces for the establishment of a large Air Force Depot, eventually known as the Air Service Production Center No. 2. Romorantin was selected due to the low population density, the flatness of the terrain, the large presence of timber and also the fact that a large number or railroads between the Atlantic shipping ports converged there and also went into the Zone of the Advance (Western Front). Facilities American Arrival in Romorantin, France, 28 June 1917 On 28 June 1917, the first American forces arrived, the 75th, 109th and 116th Aero Squadrons (Construction) which initially established quarters for themselves in the French Army Camp des Bluets about three miles away from the facility. The first construction was that of a railroad line and barracks for themselves at the field.Series 1, Paris Headquarters and Supply Section, Volume 18 History of the Air Service Production Center No. 2 at Romorantin, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. Within two weeks, the barracks were ready and construction of the actual base was begun. The 116th Squadron was transferred out and the 75th and 109th were re-designated as the 487th Aero (Construction) and 803d Aero (Repair). Construction then began in earnest on the base facilities and also two landing field. Additional units brought in for construction were the 465th and 493d Aero Squadrons (Construction). A compound for the American soldiers assigned to Romorantin was established at a French barracks named North Camp Gièvres in the nearby town of Pruniers-en-Sologne. The camp eventually became the home of almost 30,000 personnel, living in barracks. However, their influence in Pruniers, along with the towns of Gièvres, Villefranche-sur-Cher and Romorantin was evident. They made many friends with the local inhabitants and frequented the shops, restaurants and taverns daily. Also the Americans relied on the local economy for civilian workers such as bakers, cooks, and various tradesmen. Eventually the facility consisted of over 200 buildings on 40 hectares of land; a gasoline and oil depot; refrigerator plant; weapons storage area, a workshop for locomotive repair; three aircraft landing fields along with extensive aircraft assembly and repair buildings along with aircraft hangars at the landing fields and a large balloon hangar. Major buildings on the base were: Air Service Production Center No. 2 site map, 1918 * Q1 and Q2 - Quartermaster Storage * W1-A/B, W2-A/B, W3-A/B/D, W-4A/B/C/D - General Storage Warehouses * 1-A/B - DH-4 Day Aircraft Assembly * 2-C - DH-4 Night Bomber Assembly * 2-A/B DH-4 Salvage and Repair * S-1A/B/C/D, S-2A/B/C/D, S-3A/B/C/D, S-4A/B/C/D General Aircraft Storage * M-1/2/3 - Motor Transport * 3-A/B Night Bombing Warehouses There were four airfield hangars (H-1/2/3/4) and a Balloon Hangar (BH-2) on two main airfields. What was unique about the Center was that the American-built railroads on the site amounted to over 200 km of narrow-gauge and standard-gauge trackage. Over 14,000 railroad cars of all types and 200 locomotives were assigned to the facility by the time of the Armistice in November 1918. Operations Initially, the main purpose of the Center was the assembly and final testing of airplanes and engines manufactured in the United States. However the Center also developed into a major supply depot for the Dayton-Wright built DH-4 along with the Liberty Engines. It also was a storage and repair depot for all balloons used by the Air Service. ;; DH-4 Aircraft Assembly and Repair Dh-4 crates on rail cars arriving at Romorantin V-12 Liberty Engine installation in building 1-A 1st completed DH-4, 16 May 1918 Building 1-A was the main facility for DH-4 assembly. Aircraft manufactured in the United States were dis-assembled and crated prior to shipment to East Coast Seaports. There, the crates were loaded onto ships that sailed north to Halifax, Nova Scotia where they were assembled into convoys for the trans-Atlantic crossing. Upon their arrival in European waters, the ships were unloaded either in England or ports in France. The aircraft crates were loaded on flatbed rail cars and routed to Romorantin. This also included the Liberty L-12 aircraft engines, built by Ford, Cadillac, Lincoln, Packard, and General Motors. Upon arrival, the aircraft fuselage and wing components were re-assembled, along with the pilot cockpit instruments, seat and controls. The engines would be installed along with the propeller, fuel tank and the machine guns; bomb racks and other combat equipment. Experiences in combat resulted in certain modifications to the aircraft and engines be performed before being released for operational use. This increased their effectiveness. Once certified ready for flight, the aircraft would be taken to one of eventually three flying fields where pilots would perform a checkout flight and insure everything was in working order. The assembled aircraft were then flown to the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-les-Belles Aerodrome where they would be assigned to the combat squadrons at the front. The aircraft assembly and dispatch being the primary mission of Romorantin, secondary work performed at the base was performed by a large Engineering Department. This department included a large storage depot for all hardware fasteners, spare parts, spruce lumber, machine shops, metal workshops, along with armament, radio and camera repair shops for damaged equipment. Beginning in September 1918, a separate facility for Italian Caproni Ca.5 heavy bomber aircraft was established, however the Armistice in November 1918 ended the war before it could be put into production The Engineering Department also established an aircraft salvage and repair facility in Building B-1 to salvage, reclaim and repair crashed airplanes retrieved from the front. All aircraft engine installation was done by this department, however engines salvaged from crashed aircraft were turned over to the Engine Overhaul Shop. When an aircraft was damaged in combat, or would crash on our side of the front line, a crew would be sent from the 1st Air Depot to dismantle the plane and bring it back to be repaired, if possible. French aircraft were taken to Colombey, while American aircraft were sent to Romorantin. Here if the aircraft could be repaired, it was, or it was placed on a salvage pile where it could be cannibalized for usable parts. ;; Supply Depot 2 and 3 The other important mission of Romorantin was Supply Depot No 3., which began operations in late March 1918. Initially operated by the 636th Aero Squadron (Supply), it was later joined by the 649th and 667th Aero Squadrons (Supply). The Depot's mission was the storage of aviation supplies, raw materials and equipment received from the United States for distribution to advance depots, air parks, schools and combat squadrons. The Depot stored airplane instruments and accessories; aviation clothing and equipment; portable hangars of canvas and steel; foreign motor forgings and bearings; hardwood lumber for aircraft construction and repair; linen and canvas for wings and fuselage covering; metal fasteners of all kinds; electrical equipment; tools; construction materiel and machinery, steel and radio equipment. Liberty Engine storage building Supply Depot No. 2 was the Liberty Engine spare parts depot, and handled every spare part for the engine used by the Air Service in France. Originally part of Supply Depot No 3, it was separated early in June 1918 and managed by the 649th Aero Squadron (Supply). Each Liberty Engine could be operated between 20 and 30 hours in the air before it was needed to be overhauled; therefore, for each aircraft at least 3 or 4 engines were in the process of overhaul or in ready reserve in the field. Besides the Liberty Engines, many LeRhone, Renault, Fiat, Hispano-Suisa, Salmson, Cloget and Clemont engines were received and distributed, along with spare parts for them. A propeller shop for the repair of damaged propellers, along with spares for rapid shipment to combat squadrons was maintained. In addition to the engine parts, Depot No. 2 also managed the storage of over 3,000 Merlin fixed and Lewis flexible mounte machine guns, 10,000 spare magazines each holding 97 rounds of ammunition, over a thousand gunner's belts and various other ordinance equipment. A scarcity of railroad rolling stock meant that cars arriving at the Depot needed to be unloaded quickly so they could be released for other uses. This activity was carried out 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Also a shortage of trucks was another problem which meant that each truck leaving the Depot had to have its shipment organized for quick unloading at its destination so it could complete its convoy shipment and return to the Depot for re-loading. During the big offensives of the war during 1918, it was necessary to rush the materiel to the various field depots and combat squadrons at the front. During these periods, men frequently remained at their posts between 12 and 16 hours a day processing requisitions to get the shipments out the same day if possible. ;; Balloon Department Balloon Hangar Flying Field #1 The Balloon Department was responsible for providing all necessary materiel to support the Observation Balloon Companies at the front. Caquot Observation balloons, manufactured both in France as well as the United States were received at Romorantin and rigged for combat use. Once prepared and inspected for service they were trucked to the combat Companies. This also included parachutes for the observers. A large amount of cloth, adhesive tape, rubberised glue, and silk, roes and cords were kept on hand for repairs. The Balloon Repair Depot received damaged Balloons and was equipped with sewing machines, bloweres, long tables, benches canvas, silk, wicker and the equipment needed to repair and ship back to the field balloons quickly. ;; Transportation Department The Transportation Department was responsible for the overhauling, repair and shipment of all motor vehicles used by the Air Service in France. The 803d Aero Squadron (Transportation) was responsible for furnishing vehicle spare parts and supplies to all Air Service units, bringing vehicles from the ports, holding them in reserve, and delivering them to organizations as required. It also recovered damaged vehicles which it brought back to Romorantin for repair or salvage. By August 1918, this mission was taken over by the Air Service Motor Transportation Corps which continued the work of the 803d. The MTC established a depot for foreign-made trucks and supplies. A school for vehicle mechanics was also established at Romorantin. ;; Medical Department Three large hospitals were established at Romorantin, providing medical treatment for casualties incurred in combat. It also treated personnel who were injured in the course of their duties or off-duty recreational activities, those who required dental work, and those who contracted Venereal Diseases. Post Armistice use Abandoned buildings at Romorantin, Summer, 1919 Scrap pile of aircraft engines, paperwork and other abandoned materiel at Romorantin, summer, 1919 With the end of combat in November 1918, the mission of Romorantin was wound down. The depot began receiving large numbers of DH-4 Combat Aircraft from the 1st Air Depot that were used in combat. The aircraft, basically having no further use, were disassembled, and their engines either piled in storage or sold. Also captured German aircraft, abandoned on airfields in France, were sent to Romorantin for various testing and then dis-assembly for shipment back to the United States. When the Air Service in France was ordered demobilized in April 1919, the Americans at Romorantin turned the facility over to the French Government, leaving warehouses full of supplies, equipment, tools dis-assembled aircraft and trucks to the care of the French, abandoning almost everything in place. The French, in turn, contracted with a private company for the sale and disposal of the facility for liquidation. Sales were held for clothing, hardware and small tools. Entire buildings were sold to buyers and everything inside it. In the countryside, many farms found themselves with former American buildings being used for various purposes. A group of 200 guards were hired to protect the facility, however many people looted and ransacked the deserted buildings still filled with goods. Fortunes were made at the expense of the public good. =Inter-war period= In the 1920s, a small portion of the former American depot (137 ha) was used as Aviation General Store # 3. It became an aircraft equipment and training center. It was later designated as BA 304, Camp Blume. It grew during the 1920s and 1930s and became a major employer in the region, with the salaries of its civilian employees being 30% higher than the private sector. =World War II= During the Battle of France in 1940, Camp Blume was attacked by 18 bombers of the German Luftwaffe on 25 May. The entire facility was severely damaged. The defenses of the base at the time consisted of only three aircraft, flown by Polish pilots who gave chase. Later that night, the airfield was again attacked and the Luftwaffe again dropped bombs on the field. On 5 June, in the beginning of the afternoon, 17 Luftwaffe bombers again bombed the facility and the main warehouse was evacuated. On the morning of 19 June the German Army entered Romorantin and seized control of the airfield and facilities. With the Armistice with Germany on 22 June, the airfield was placed in control of the Luftwaffe, the airfield being renamed Feldluftpark Romorantin.The Luftwaffe, 1936–1945 Feldluftpark Romorantin Some of the former civilian employees of Camp Blume were rehired for the rehabilitation of the airfield and the construction of hangars for aircraft. An unidentified Luftwaffe unit, flying Heinkel He 111 bombers used Romorantin in the fall of 1940 flying bombing missions over England. Many do not return During the occupation, known Luftwaffe units assigned to the airfield were: * Fluganwärter-Bataillon V (July–November 1942) * Flieger- Regiment 91 (26 February-2 September 1944) * 1 Staffle Jagdgeschwader 105 (1./JG105) (21 March-1 August 1944) Fw-190 Romorantin was attacked by twenty- one American Eighth Air Force B-24 Liberators (Mission 295) on 10 April 1944, destroying most of 1./JG105 and its facilities.USAAF Chronology April 1944 One can still see bomb craters on the airfield. The Germans abandoned the airfield in the last days of August 1944 and the Free French Army moved into the area on 2 September. =Subsequent use= The French Air Force has used Romorantin as a storage depot and the Technical Documentation Center of Air Force (CDTAA) since 15 December 1944. In 1973, CVA 602, the Center Gliding Force was created which trains French Glider Pilots. Today, the depot is located in the site of the main World War I American 1-A and 1-B DH-4 assembly buildings and primarily supports the Dassault Rafale F1 Advanced Technology Fighter. The former American Flying Field #1 remains a grass field, and is used by the glider training school.

He had also established a restaurant chain, Marco's. He later bought partial ownership of James Coney Island and other restaurant chains. In the late 1980s, Bombaywala traveled to New York City for five days to do research on delicatessens. Each day, he ate at three different delicatessens. After he returned to Houston, he took recipes from one of the partners who agreed to work with him, Mrs. Katz. By 1989 he opened Guggenheim's Delicatessen, a New York-style deli,Gabaccia, Donna R.

This meant he received the vice chairperson position and a 54% ownership of the combined company. At the time of the merger, the Billy Blues restaurants were making losses and had a large debt. In September the board of the merged company elected Bombaywala as the chairperson. At the time there were 12 Billy Blues restaurants, including one in Houston. Billy Blues also owned 20 Marcos Mexican Restaurants in Houston and those were acquired too. Bombaywala planned to move the Billy Blues headquarters from San Antonio to Houston. By 1998 he had established a holding company for some of his restaurants, Watermarc Food Management Co., and he served as its chairperson. It was the holding company of Billy Blues Barbecue Bar & Grill, Marco's Mexican Restaurant, and The Original Pasta Co. In regards to Billy Blues, Bombaywala was unable to turn around that restaurant nor was he able to placate the company's creditors. In January 1999 Watermarc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. By September 1999 five Billy Blue's restaurants closed. By 1999, Bombaywala appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show, and the episode discussed the rise of his business empire. On Monday August 30, 1999 a U.S. bankruptcy court approved of the bankruptcy settlement. According to the settlement, the assets, including 29 restaurants, were to be sold to Five Points Investments Inc., a company owned by Haroon Sheikh, for $13 million. The restaurants were to continue to be operated under their current names. Watermarc was scheduled to be dissolved. Shaikh became the sole owner and CEO of Five Points, while Bombaywala became the overseer of daily management at Five Points. At the time the restaurants had a combined total of 1,200 employees. =2000s= In December 2000 Bombaywala closed Guggenheim's. The remaining Billy Blues Bar & Grill location on Richmond Avenue in Houston closed in January 2001. At its peak, Five Points, later named Five Star Restaurants, Inc., and headquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, had over 40 restaurants. In September 2003 Five Points, now named Five Star, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On the day of the bankruptcy filing, Bombaywala resigned as the president of the company.

In 2006 Bombaywala himself filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. By 2006 Bombaywala's son officially owned Michelangelo's. Foundation work After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Bombaywala became the head of the Pakistani-American Association of Greater Houston (PAGH). He began advocating for more humane treatment of people of Pakistani descent. In the mid-2000s Bombaywala had a conflict with Houston City Council member M.J. Khan. After the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, the two men organized separate relief efforts instead of doing a joint effort.

Lawrence Weber (c. 1872 – 22 February 1940) was an American sports promoter, stage show producer and theater manager. He was active in arranging vaudeville shows, legitimate theater and films. He once tried to bypass laws against importing a boxing film to the USA by projecting it on a screen just across the border in Canada and filming the screening from the USA side. Early years L. Lawrence Weber was born in New York City in 1869. At the age of thirteen, in 1882 he organized a company of young amateur minstrels who toured Long Island, New York. He posted the company's bills, took tickets and performed on stage. In 1883 he joined the Excelsior Minstrels. For a period Weber was the secretary of the British Minister to Japan, and became the American representative of the Japanese Government Tea Syndicate. In 1897 Weber was proprietor of Weber's Olympia Company and the Marion Extravaganza Company. These consisted of two touring theater companies and two other attractions. Weber became one of the leaders of the Columbia burlesque wheel, or the Eastern Wheel, with Samuel Scribner and Gus Hill, later to be part of the Columbia Amusement Company. They wanted to attract women to their shows, and promoted relatively clean entertainment. In 1908 they banned wrestling and prize fighting from their circuit. However, Columbia set up a second circuit in 1915, the American Burlesque Association, that staged raunchier shows. On 4 December 1910 Weber announced a plan to form a circuit of popular theaters, the Lawrence Weber Co-operative Booking Circuit. The investors were Weber, Sam A. Scribner, John Herbert Mack and Rudolph K. Hynicka. They planned to acquire forty theaters in cities around the United States and Canada, and to supply them with forty theater companies playing in rotation. They would put on equal numbers of melodramas, society plays, comedy dramas, farce comedies and musical comedies, charging popular prices. The partners were all associated with the \\"Eastern Wheel\\" of burlesque theaters, which had a similar business model. Cinema The knock-out in the 1915 Johnson-Willard fight Weber was one of the sponsors of a film made of a boxing match in Havana, Cuba, on 5 April 1915 between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. He obtained the copyright on the film. He was refused permission to import it on the basis of a Federal law prohibiting import of such films for public exhibition. Weber argued that this law was not constitutional, since it infringed on the rights of states. The case was heard in the Supreme Court in December 1915, and decided against Weber. In 1916 Weber made a widely publicized attempt to bypass the restriction. He set up a motion picture camera south of the border between New York and Canada, pointing to a screen on the Canadian side on which each frame of the film of the 1915 Havana fight was projected, thus creating a duplicate negative. He lost the court case that followed on the basis that he had violated the spirit of the law. Weber, Bobby North, Aaron Hoffman and Harry J. Cohen organized Popular Plays and Players, the precursor of Metro Pictures. In 1914 the Popular Plays and Players production company issued a film version of Jules Verne's Michael Strogoff. In March 1915 Weber, whom Variety described as a \\"colorful showman, sports promoter\\", was involved in founding Metro Pictures. As of June 1915 Weber was acting head of Popular Plays and Players. Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman (1917) Weber later formed the L. Lawrence Weber Photodrama Corporation to make films, and in 1917 made Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman, starring John Barrymore. Variety said, \\"By virtue of its artistry, intensely sustained suspense and irrefutable logic, [the film] must grip audiences for many seasons.\\" The production company made The Blue Pearl in 1920 based on the play by Anne Crawford Flexner, starring Edith Hallor, Lumsden Hare, Earl Schenck and John Halliday. Post-war In 1919 John Golden arranged a meeting with his fellow producers J. Fred Zimmerman Jr., Archibald Selwyn, Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., Winchell Smith and Weber with the goal of cooperating on common issues such as censorship and ticket speculation. He wanted to set up a forum so the producers could share ideas, and wanted stop the rival organizations poaching each other's stars. This led to formation of the Producing Managers' Association, which may have inadvertently shown actors the value of organizing into the Actors' Equity Association. In 1921 Weber and William B. Friedlander were in partnership to present dramatic, musical and vaudeville attractions at the Longacre Theatre on Broadway. In 1923 Weber was managing the Little Theatre on Broadway. He had leased it from Winthrop Ames in partnership with John Golden and F. Ray Comstock. That year the theater staged Guy Bolton's comedies Polly Preferred and Chicken Feed. Chicken Feed had a successful run, but had to close when Weber moved his Little Jessie James from the Longacre to the Little. In 1925 Weber went into partnership with Harry Houdini to present a traveling show that featured the magician. The show opened on 31 August 1925 at the Maryland Theater in Baltimore for three nights. It came to New York in December 1925. The show ran for two and a half hours in three acts. The first act featured magic tricks, in the second Houdini performed one of his famous escapes, and the third act gave an exposé of fraudulent techniques used by spirit mediums. Orson Welles said the third act was \\"riveting, like a perverse sort of revival meeting\\". After Houdini died in October 1926, Weber was one of the honorary pallbearers at his funeral. On 23 May 1925 the Darlington Golf and Country Club opened in Mahwah, New Jersey, with Weber named president. After an impressive opening festival, the club soon ran into financial problems and was forced into foreclosure.

In 1676 Governor Thomas Dongan appointed him Magistrate Commissary, and later Envoy to Canada. In 1686 he was a signatory of the \\"Charter of Beverwijck.\\" After the first election under the charter he was appointed Recorder, in which office he served for ten years. In 1684, he was one of the purchasers of the 150,000 acre Saratoga Patent together with Cornelis Van Dyck, Jan Jansen Bleecker, Pieter Schuyler, Johannes Wendel, David Schuyler, and Robert Livingston the Elder. He was also one of the purchasers of the disputed Mohawk Patent in 1697, and other property. =Political career= At the time of the Schenectady massacre in 1690 Ten Broeck served as envoy to the Mohawks, Oneidas, and Onondagas to determine their loyalties.

Many fish activities are dependent on olfaction, such as: mating, discriminating kin, avoiding predators, locating food, contaminant avoidance, imprinting and homing.Tierney KB, Baldwin DH, Hara TJ, Ross PS, Scholz NL, Kennedy CJ. 2010. Olfactory toxicity in fishes. Aquatic Toxicology 96 2-26.Tierney KB, Singh CR, Ross PS, Kennedy CJ. 2007. Relating olfactory neurotoxicity to altered olfactory-mediated behaviors in rainbow trout exposed to three currently-used pesticides. Aquatic Toxicology 81, 55-64. These activities are referred to as “olfactory-mediated.” Impairment of the olfactory system threatens survival and has been used as an ecologically relevant sub-lethal toxicological endpoint for fish within studies. Olfactory information is received by sensory neurons, like the olfactory nerve, that are in a covered cavity separated from the aquatic environment by mucus. Since they are in almost direct contact with the surrounding environment, these neurons are vulnerable to environmental changes. Fish can detect natural chemical cues in aquatic environments at concentrations as low as parts per billion (ppb) or parts per trillion (ppt).Belanger RM, Corkum LD, Li W, Zielinski BS. 2006. Olfactory sensory input increases gill ventilation in male round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) during exposure to steroids. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology-Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology 144 196-202. Studies have shown that exposures to metals, pesticides, or surfactants can disrupt fish olfaction, which can impact their survival and reproductive success. Many studies have indicated copper as a source of olfactory toxicity in fishes, among other common substances. Olfactory toxicity can occur by multiple, complex Modes of Toxic Action. History Early investigation by Hasler and Wisby (1951) examined how fish use olfactory imprinting to discriminate smells in order for fish to find their natal streams.Quinn TP. 2005. The Behavior and Ecology of Pacific Salmon and Trout. American Fisheries Society. Bethesda, Maryland. 1st ed. This research provided the framework for testing synthetic chemicals used by hatcheries to examine homing and straying by hatchery fish. The investigation of the toxicity of mercury and copper to the olfactory systems in fish began in the early 1970s. Where they found that solutions of mercury chloride (HgCl2) and copper sulfate (CuSO4) depressed olfactory response during exposure to the two toxicants and found that toxicant concentration and olfactory response had an inverse relationship to each other.Toshiaki J, Hara YM, Law C, Macdonald, S. 1976. Effects of Mercury and Copper on the Olfactory Response in Rainbow Trout, Salmo gairdneri [Oncorhynchus mykiss]. Journal of Fisheries Research Board of Canada. 33: 1568 - 1573. Olfactory system Olfaction begins with an interaction between an odorant molecule and an olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) located within the epithelium of the Glomerulus bulb. Odorants bind to receptor proteins that are held within individual OSNs. It is important to note that not all fish have the same types or number of receptor proteins making olfactory toxicity and the subsequent effects species specific. There are three types of OSN cells: (1) ciliated cells, microvillus cells, and crypt cells. These cells are distributed across the olfactory epithelium (OE), OSNs that express common binding receptor proteins are connected to the olfactory bulb (OB) by axons. The changes in olfactory function can be placed into three categories: (1) anosmia, the inability to smell; (2) hyposmia, a reduced ability to smell; or (3) dysosmia, where olfactory signals are incorrectly processed. Most chemicals at lower concentrations cause a degree of hyposmia while at higher concentrations anosmia is the result. Dysomia is less commonly observed, however, cases of fish becoming attracted to metal-contaminated waters have been studied and examined. Metals Metals are a necessary and important trace element that most organisms need to function properly. They are often used as coenzymes or interact with biological enzymes to form complexes inside organisms.Sorensen M., 1991. Metal Poisoning in Fish. Boca Raton, Florida. CRC Press, Inc. However, if the metals in question are in too high of concentrations it can be fatal. Different parameters such as pH, alkalinity, temperature, fish size, or salinity can alter how the metals interact or are metabolized by the organism. Fish are oftentimes less tolerant to metals than terrestrial animals are. Their gills are sensitive to changes in their environment and highly susceptible to metal toxicity.Langston, W.J., Bebianno, M.J., 1998. Metal Metabolisms in Aquatic Environments. Padstow, Cornwall. Chapman & Hall. Before a metal may have toxic effects it can also cause a change in olfactory response, or other responses, within fish. If the exposure is short in length or low in concentration the effects can be reversed, but at high enough concentrations it becomes toxic to the organism leading to death.Sandahl J., Miyasaka G., Koide N., Ueda H. 2006. Olfactory inhibition and recovery in chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) following copper exposure. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 63:1840-1847, 10.1139/f06-074. Copper, cadmium, lead, and zinc are common metals that cause olfactory toxicity in fish. Copper is a metal looked at in more detail than others. This is because it is commonly used in fish hatcheries as an algaecide as it is an effective way to prevent parasitic and fungal infections within fish populations at hatcheries. It can also be released from industrial or agricultural sources. Either applied in a chemical spray or deposit, or used within copper netting on the outside of aquaculture, copper kills algae and bacteria that can cause fish to become sick. However, it does induce olfactory toxicity at relevant concentrations to aquaculture. =Mechanism of action= Metals mechanism of action has been hypothesized to inhibit the electrical properties of olfactory neurons by blocking ligand-gated or voltage-gated ion channels in the nervous system of fish. However, direct mechanisms of action for metals are not fully understood and still need to be researched further. =Past studies= Copper A 2006 study from Japan focused on olfactory inhibition in chum salmon and their ability to recover from copper toxicity after being exposed to relevant copper concentrations that are often used on hatchery fishes. The fish were exposed to the relevant concentrations for four hours while using an electro-olfactogram (EOG). Results showed that copper toxicity both depended on exposure concentration and time. A combination of these parameters, as well as other parameters, can change the degree of impact on target sites as well as if the toxic effects are reversible or not. Under short-term, four-hour exposures the chum salmon recovered from the toxic effects after one day. In hatchery fish this short-term effect will likely not cause harm, but in wild fish this olfactory disruption may impair important survival instincts and strategies. Based on current research a specific mechanism of action for copper toxicity has not been identified and more research is needed. Another study investigated morphological changes in olfactory mucosa of Tilapia mariae when exposed to low levels of the copper toxicant. The fish were exposed to 20, 40 and 100μg/L copper for four days, then allowed to recover in untreated water and were monitored during recovery. After ten full days of recovery all sample tissues tested showed no significant difference between that and the control group. This suggests that at low levels the copper damage done to the olfactory system is reversible and tissue integrity can be restored.Bettini S., Ciani F., Franceschini V. 2006. Recovery of the olfactory receptor neurons in the African Tilapia mariae following exposure to low copper level. Bologna, Italy. Aquatic Toxicology 76: 321-328. A third study wanted to compare hatchery raised fish tolerance to copper versus naturally-reared fish to see if there is a plausible difference between the two species and their tolerance to copper levels in their system. They exposed naturally-reared steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to 5 and 20 μg/L for 3 hours. Based on their EOG readings the olfactory function was depressed and the steelhead showed a disruption of olfactory response to the amino acid L-serine in a dose-dependent manner. Their data was consistent with previous studies that expose hatchery-raised fish species to copper. This means that there is no significant difference or level of tolerance between naturally- reared or hatchery-reared fish for copper tolerances.Baldwin D., Tatara C., Scholz N. 2010. Copper-induced olfactory toxicity in salmon and steelhead: Extrapolation across species and rearing environments. Aquatic Toxicology 101(1): 295-297. Cadmium Williams and Gallager from the University of Washington studied effects of cadmium on olfactory mediated behaviors and biomarkers in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) over the course of a 48-hour exposure time and 16-day depuration. Coho exposed to 347 ppb Cd (high range dose) over the 48 hours expressed high levels of olfactory inhibition, behavioral deficits, histological injury and altered expression of olfactory biomarkers. After the 16-day cleansing period to allow the salmon to recover the behavior deficits, histological injuries, and altered expressions were still evident. Coho exposed to 3.7 ppb Cd (low range dose) still exhibited the same responses, just less severe in effects. After the 16-day depuration period adverse behavioral effects were still apparent in the low dose organisms.Williams C., Gallagher E. (2013). Effects of cadmium on olfactory mediated behaviors and molecular biomarkers in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Aquatic Toxicology 140-141: 295-302. =Impacts= Just like other metals in aquatic systems in low enough exposures the toxic effects on fish populations can be reversed with removal of the contaminants from the ecosystem. If exposure is too high or for prolonged durations irreversible cell damage can occur which eventually leads to cell death. Olfactory toxicity due to metals cause a general depression of the olfactory system leading to decreased sense of smell, loss of homing sense to natal streams, loss of ability to choose a preferred mate, and trouble locating food. Pesticides Pesticides are useful tools in modern society. Depending on the chemical and how lipophilic, or fat-loving, they are they can move in and out of organisms at different rates. Pesticides are another group of toxicants that can cause olfactory disruption in fish. =Mechanism of action= Dissolved neurotoxins may: 1) compete with natural odorants for binding sites on olfactory neuron receptor proteins 2) change the activation properties of these receptors 3) move to the cytosol of the sensory neuron where the modify intracellular signaling.Scholz NL, Truelove NK, French BL, Berejikian BA, Quinn TP, Casillas E, Collier TK. 2000. Diazinon disrupts antipredator and homing behaviors in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science 57: 1911-1918. Pesticides that act as acetylcholinesterase inhibiting neurotoxins are known to reduce the responsiveness of olfactory sensory neurons to natural stimuli. The effects of these pesticides on the olfactory system is thought to be related to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, but the role of acetylcholinesterase in the olfactory system is unknown. Pesticides also are known to affect other enzymes in the olfactory system. The specific mechanisms are unknown, but there is evidence that pesticides and metals have different targets in the olfactory epithelium. =Past studies= Studies on pesticides and olfaction in fishes have looked at neurophysiological effects,Sandhal JF, Baldwin DH, Jenkins JJ, Scholz NL. 2004. Odor-evoked field potentials as indicators of sublethal neurotoxicity in juvenile Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exposed to copper, chlorpyrifos, or esfenvalerate. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science 61(3): 404-413. behavioral effects, and reproductive effects.Moore A, Waring CP. 2001. The effects of a synthetic pyrethroid pesticide on some aspects of reproduction in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Aquatic Toxicology 52(1): 1-12.Moore A, Waring CP. 1996. Sublethal effects of the pesticide Diazinon on olfactory function in mature male Atlantic salmon parr. Journal of Fish Biology 48(4): 758-775. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are neurotoxins that cause acetylcholinesterase inhibition in fish. Acetyl cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides are known to cause hyposmia. Acetylcholinesterase plays an essential role within the olfactory epithelium related to mucous production. Diazinon, an organophosphate, was found to disrupt olfactory pheromone signals that induced antipredator behavior, such as predator avoidance. It also disrupts homing behavior in Chinook salmon at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Fewer diazinon-treated chinook returned to the hatchery than control fish. Studies have found that olfactory sensory neurons do not respond to certain pesticides. Fish did not detect chlorpyrifos, esfenvalerate, and atrazine using their sense of smell and did not avoid waters contaminated with these chemicals. This contrasts metals, which elicits an avoidance response in fish. Round-up was only avoided at concentrations that caused acute lethality. Ovulating female salmon release a pheromone in their urine. After detection by the olfactory system of mature male salmon parr, plasma sex steroids and milt increase. A synthetic pyrethroid pesticide, cypermethrin, reduced or inhibited normal olfactory system response in males to the priming effect of these pheromones. Atrazine, carbofuran and diazinon were also found to reduce olfactory detection of female priming pheromones by male Atlantic salmon parr. =Impacts= *Behavioral effects Chinook salmon previously exposed to diazinon continued to be active and feed in the presence of an alarm stimulus that represented a potential predator. Normal anti-predator behavior exhibited by controls included freezing, reduced food capture, and movement to lower areas of the water column. Diazinon-exposed salmon parr would be at higher risk to predation. *Reproduction Reduced production of milt and plasma sex hormones in males due to the inability to detect the female salmon priming pheromones. *Population Survival and reproductive success of Pacific Northwest salmon may be lower in streams contaminated with neurotoxic pesticides such as diazinon. These chemicals are most common in urban and agricultural watersheds, thus salmon populations in these areas may be affected. Delayed spawning in bluegill exposed to a pyrethroid was thought to be a result of disruption to the synchronization of spawning between the sexes signaled by pheromones.Tanner DK, Knuth ML. 1996. Effects of esfenvalerate on the reproductive success of the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus in littoral enclosures. Arch. Environ. Contam. Toxicology 31: 244-251. Delayed spawning readiness in males has the potential to impact reproduction in populations. The effect of pesticides on homing ability may increase straying, in which fish do not return to their natal streams to spawn, can lead to colonizing new habitats, but it can also diminish genetic integrity or the number of spawning animals of the original stream. Surfactants =Mechanism of action= Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is an anionic detergent that has more than one probable mode of action. The interaction of SLS with mucus, proteins, and membranes result in multiple possible modes of action.Hara, TJ. Thompson, BE. 1978. The reaction of Whitefish, Coregonus clupeaformis, to the anionic detergent sodium lauryl sulfate and its effects on their olfactory responses. Water Research. 12: 893 – 897. The depression in olfactory sense (hyposmia) at low concentrations caused by interaction with mucus is most often a result of the disruption of mucus layers of the olfactory bulb causing avoidance behavior in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Additionally, SLS can reversibly and irreversibly alter protein structure because they act to solubilize the lipid bilayer of membranes and denature proteins. This can lead to decreased enzyme activity, changes in permeability and altered transport characteristics of membranes. =Past studies= Few studies have examined the effects of surfactants, adjuvants, and emulsifiers on fish olfaction. Neurological indicators of olfactory toxicity indicate that the surfactant sodium lauryl sulfonate (SLS) at 0.5 mg/L depressed L-serine and evoked responses in lake white fish (Coregonus clupeaformis) by 50%.Ishida, Y. Kobayashi, H. 1995. Avoidance behavior of carp to pesticides and decrease of the avoidance threshold by addition of sodium lauryl sulfate. Fisheries Science 61, 441–446, Tokyo. =Impacts= *Behavior Avoidance behavior exhibited by fish is species specific, Whitefish (C. clupeaformis) showed a preference toward SLS at a concentration of 0.1 mg/L while rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) showed an avoidance response at a concentration of 0.01 ug/L. Past studies are difficult to compare due to differences in test and exposure conditions. Implications The disruption of olfaction and potential effects to survival and reproductive success at environmentally-relevant concentrations metals, pesticides or surfactants have implications for fish and salmon recovery because these are commonly found in western United States streams. Conventional, acute and chronic toxicity testing do not explicitly address nervous system function and underestimate thresholds for toxicity in salmonids. Since these effects are not explicitly looked at during studies they oftentimes can go unnoticed. Olfactory toxicity occurring at environmentally relevant concentrations can induce reduction to food odor attraction and predator scent or alarm response pheromones can cause major problems with survivorship. Olfactory toxicity can also affect the ability of anadromous fish to find their natal stream causing them to stray to other streams.

How humans observe and define the world is influenced by culture. Culture also appears to influence the way people experience depression. Research shows that individual's experience with depression can vary from country to country. For example, a qualitative study revealed that some countries did not recognize post-natal depression as an illness; rather, it was viewed as a state of unhappiness that did not require any health interventions.  Causes  = Collectivism = In contrast to the individualistic views of the Western culture, which emphasize individual thought, achievement, and well being, Eastern cultures operate on collectivism, which focuses on the group and the interdependency of its members rather than any one person. The collectivistic view of the self is that it can only be understood through one's social relationships and affiliations. These relationships and affiliations make up a network where the nuclear family shares the closest bonds, followed by the extended family and close friends. Although the collectivism of Eastern cultures creates a strong support system for the group, it produces many stressors that can lead to depression and anxiety. For example, the overwhelming focus on the group rather than the individual can result in feelings of a lost individual identity and sense of self. Identity issues such as these are historically linked with depression. Moreover, many rules and social norms exist in collective cultures than in individual cultures to maintain the harmony of the group. This combined with the cohesiveness of the group can make social mistakes very public and result in feelings of shame and embarrassment by the individual at fault. Research indicates that these feelings are associated with social anxiety within collectivistic societies. A bigger mistake that affects an individual's reputation or results in the loss of honor has more severe consequences because of the stress associated with maintaining that honor. Symptoms of depression are often expressed differently in collectivistic societies than individualistic ones. Overarching psychological pain and guilt are often a result of depression. Guilt and distress are symptoms of depression; yet they may be experienced differently across cultures. A study by Pewzner-Apeloig and colleagues (1994) found that differences in the way depression was experienced in terms of guilt between African and Western cultures existed. This serves as an example to demonstrate how differences in collectivistic societies in comparison to individualistic societies matter. The expression of symptoms of depression changed in these countries. The way communities combat depression varies on the basis of whether it is within a collectivistic society or not. It has been shown that a better support system is in place for those who are susceptible to depression in collectivistic societies. On the other hand, in individualized societies, depression is primarily combated through solo work in therapy. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is used by psychologists to change one's thoughts and behavioral patterns. CBT has been shown to be quite effective. Both ways of approaching and treating depression can be effective. Less emphasis on the individual can help minimize rumination and self loathing which are both linked to or direct symptoms of depression. Yet, more focus on the individuals thought patterns and intervention of negative thoughts and behaviors can be effective. = Acculturation = The process of acculturation involves adjusting one's values, attitudes, and cultural practices in to order to effectively adapt to a new culture. Acculturation is difficult for most immigrants, but especially so for Eastern immigrants since the Western and Eastern cultures differ greatly. The biggest challenges Eastern immigrants must face when they travel to America are the sudden loss of a support system, child rearing, and limited knowledge about the American way of life. Coming from a collectivist culture that places great emphasis on relationships, immigrants may mourn the loss of their friends and family. The likelihood of suicide and depression tends to increase as acculturation stress, such as this loss, increases. Tensions within the nuclear family may also arise as children assimilate to the mainstream culture and language and identify less with their immigrant parents. Adolescents whose families strictly follow traditional culture are at a high risk for depression and suicide. A lack of knowledge about the American culture can increase the cultural gap between parents and children. Research shows that the level of distress and the likelihood that one will develop depression is higher in first generation immigrants than subsequent ones. This is likely due to increase psychological stress related to acculturation. A study by Tibubos states: \\"mean score patterns were similar for all groups, analyses of item loading among first‐generation migrants yielded some variance in patterns pointing out that certain items have a distinct impact on depression for specific groups.\\" The many stressors an individual or family faces by moving to a different country can explain the growing prevalence of depression. White R.M.B. et al demonstrated that environmental stressors can disrupt key parenting processes. This disrupter increase the prevalence of depression and aggression. Culture differs across countries; hence, the way things are done varies and parents must learn these differences. These changes become very stressful and can in turn lead to depression in both mothers and fathers. In White's study: “Family models and parenting styles/environmental worries which are often a result of culture could explain increased depression symptoms in parents who live in dangerous neighbors.” Adapting to a new culture is stressful and this increase in stress leads to higher prevalence for depression. = Gender = As is true in Western societies, depression is more prevalent in women than in men in collective cultures. Some have hypothesized that this is due to their inferior positions in the culture, in which they may experience domestic violence, poverty, and inequality that can greatly contribute to depression. Moreover, research conducted in the United States, Chile and Spain found that cultural differences on the expectations of individuals based on gender varied across cultures and that resulted in different levels of depression across individuals Changes in gender roles across countries and cultures in this study served to explain varying levels of stress and responsibility that changed on the basis of gender. These ever changing expectations and these additional responsibilities on the basis of gender increased levels of depression. The differences in gender roles within a community also impact one's level of depression. According to Wichstrøm (1999) women tend to ruminate more and therefore symptoms of depression can be accentuated. Since women are encouraged to talk about and share their feelings, they can get caught talking about and staying in a negative state. On the other hand, boys are taught not to discuss their feelings with others which then diminishes or even gets rid of rumination entirely. The way one is socialized to deal with their negative emotions will vary across cultures and may lead to different outcomes.  Symptoms  Considering the stigma associated with mental illnesses in the Arab culture, it is not surprising that many Easterners express depression and anxiety through somatic complaints. This is especially true with Eastern women, who may feel symptoms of depression as a result of inequality, but are taught not to express personal feelings. Instead, they complain of headaches, numbness, breathlessness, and chest pains to receive some form of medical attention. Somatization is also common among individuals with little knowledge of mental health who have no linguistic way to express their symptoms. In some parts of Chinese society, depression is expressed as and experienced in terms of a physical experience rather than psychological. According to Kleinman (2004): “Many depressed Chinese people do not report feeling sad, but rather express boredom, discomfort, feelings of inner pressure, and symptoms of pain, dizziness” This is different from the way depression is perceived in America in which people often report sadness or feeling down. Symptoms do not only vary in their expression across cultures but will also greatly vary within cultures and across individuals. Depression is a heterogeneous disorder. Sometimes depression leads to increased appetite, while other times it leads to decreased appetite. Similarly, a symptom of depression can be both an increase in sleep or decrease in sleep. Symptoms will look different from individual to individual; however, as mentioned above, the expression of these symptoms tend to follow somewhat of a trend from one culture to the next.  Stigma and knowledge of mental illness  In many other non-Western societies, a stigma is associated with mental disorders despite high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Many Easterners believe that symptoms of depression and anxiety are simply a part of life and do not require medical attention. Also, individuals from collective societies tend to be extremely careful in maintaining their reputations, and mental distress is usually interpreted as a weak faith in God and/or a weak self. Therefore, they do not seek treatment for their symptoms in order to avoid shame and gossip. This stigma stems in part from the limited knowledge many Easterners have about depression and anxiety. Multiple studies reveal that the majority Easterners do not know the names of mental illnesses. Instead, they describe their symptoms through series of physical complaints. Rates of clinical depression are greater in the West than in Asia. According to this study, Asian cultures think differently about emotions than do Western cultures. Not only do changes in one's understanding of psychological disorders change the prevalence of mental health problems it also has an impact on the rate at which these symptoms become problematic. An individual's education on mental health will impact their likelihood of seeking help.  Treatment  Research indicates that for psychologists to effectively diagnose and treat patients of an ethnic minority they need to consider cultural differences. Appropriate cultural knowledge may help psychologists appropriately adjust their methods to fit the needs of a diverse population.  Specific cultures  = Arab = The Arab American Institute Foundation estimates that there are over 3.5 million individuals with Arab-speaking ancestry residing in the United States, with thousands more arriving from the Middle East every year. As these numbers increase, so does the importance of psychologists to understand the Arab culture. Arab American immigrants make for an interesting case because they face additional discriminatory stressors associated with the events of the 9/11 attacks and political tensions in the Middle East. The causes of depression and anxiety in Arabs and Arab Americans are a combination of biological factors and psychological and social factors that are greatly influenced by the Arab culture and immigration. Research indicates that biological markers of depression are consistent between Arab and Western populations, as are many psychological factors. Arabs who seek psychological help are more confident about the effectiveness of medication over therapy. But since many Arabs either refuse to meet with mental health professionals or do not have any knowledge of them, traditional treatment methods are still commonly used. Islamic therapy, for example, involves Quran recitation by an imam to repel moral deviance from the soul of the individual. The imam may also suggest old Islamic remedies, such as ice baths and herbal antidotes. Using Islam to simply cope with psychological distress is a more widely used method of treatment that is supported by research. A study completed on depressed Pakistani patients also reported that the participants believed that medicine could rid them of their symptoms but had little to no knowledge of psychotherapy. = Latino = Latino adolescents tend to have higher levels of symptoms of depression than some of their Caucasian and African American peers. An explanation for this difference is the increase in cultural stressors that in turn add to this form of cultural disparity. Although the cultural stressors have not yet been identified, the correlation between it and symptoms of and the prevalence of depression is still significant. Within communities, discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity is also a strong contributor to the elevated number of depressive symptoms among Latino youth.

The trail begins just west of Tirzah, runs west through York, James Ross Wildlife Reservation (a South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Management Area), Sharon, Hickory Grove, Smyrna, and ends near Kings Creek. Please note, as of 4/18/15 all sections of this trail (except for the part shared by the paved York Bicycle Trail) are so overgrown as to be impassible. Also there is no signage of any kind signifying it exits at all. Use discretion. Passable sections are indicated in Google Maps as dirt bicycle trails - 7/25/16 route does get overgrown as SCDOT does not maintain the trail although owns the full right of way, which is indicated by county GIS maps. Route SC Hwy 97 in downtown Smyrna, South Carolina's smallest town. The Triple C Rail Trail is approximately from end to end, and it generally follows an east–west orientation. The trail is located wholly within York and Cherokee counties. The trail's eastern terminus is off South Carolina Highway 161 near the Plains Midstream Canada Tirzah Propane Storage Facility, about east of York. The trail roughly parallels Highway 161 in a westerly direction for about until it reaches the city of York. Heading southwest out of york the trail passes under the Kings Mountain Railroad Trail and US Route 321. The trail strikes out through woodlands west of York as it heads towards Sharon. Along the way it passes through the James Ross Wildlife Reservation. Approximately west of York, the trail passes through the town of Sharon.The section between York and Sharon is fairly remote, and not easily accessible by road. A half mile outside Sharon, the trail begins running parallel to SC Hwy 211 for about . Just before entering Hickory Grove, the trail moves eastward to run through the east side of town. North of Hickory Grove, the trail parallels South Carolina Highway 97 for approximately until the trail reaches the town of Smyrna. Beyond Smyrna the trail enters Cherokee County and roughly parallels SC Hwy 97 until the trail ends near the intersection of Hollifield Drive and Manning Road near Kings Creek. A view of the Triple C Rail Trail near Kings Creek, South Carolina. The track was removed from this section around 2007.

The trail runs along the abandoned right of way of the Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad, or Triple C. The section of railroad between Tirzah and Smyrna was constructed between 1886 and 1889. After a series of reorganizations, the railroad became a part of the Southern Railway and eventually Norfolk Southern. Freight and passenger service continued for many years. In the mid-1980s, Norfolk Southern ended rail service between York and Smyrna. Then again in the late 1980s Norfolk Southern ended service between York and Tirzah. The tracks were removed, and the first section of the Triple C Rail Trail opened as part of the York Bicycle Trail in the late 1990s. Around the same time a second portion was opened across the James Ross Wildlife Reservation. The trail continued opening in stages with the most recent section (near Kings Creek, South Carolina) being completed in 2007. The trail is operated by the City of York, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and SCDOT. Activities A combined section of the Triple C Rail Trail and the York Bicycle Trail near the York Recreation Complex in York. The trail is relatively flat with only gentle grades. It is topped with crushed limestone along most of the trail and Asphalt within the city of York. Bicycling and hiking are extremely popular during the spring, summer, and fall. Horseback riding is allowed on the western end of the trail, between Kings Creek and Smyrna. The trail intersects with two other hiking trails, including the Kings Mtn Railroad Trail. Wildlife viewing is also popular. Hawks and other large birds are commonly seen along the trail. Canada geese and ducks are also common. wild turkeys and white-tailed deer live in the wooded areas and are seen along the trail. Motorized vehicles are strictly forbidden from using the trail. This ban includes motorcycles, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. Camping is currently not allowed along the trail. Numerous lodging establishments are available in York. Hunting of white-tailed deer, wild turkey, small game and furbearers is allowed within the James Ross Wildlife Reservation, authorization is needed from the SCDNR. Parking areas are available at several locations along the entire length of the trail. Trail users should carry enough water to last for the duration of their trips, as potable water is not readily available. The City of York offers a full array of services and supplies. Restaurants are located in York and Sharon. Gasoline and other supplies are available at general stores located in York, Sharon and Hickory Grove. Future expansion The last section of the trail to open was in 2007, and there are no immediate plans to expand the trail at this time. However, several future plans exist, including one to incorporate portions of the trail, along with an extension to Rock Hill, as part of the Carolina Thread Trail See also * List of rail trails in South Carolina * Carolina Thread Trail References External links * South Carolina Department of Natural Resources - James Ross Wildlife Reservation * Abandoned Rails - Wateree to Kings Creek * City of York recreation facilities * Knights Inn Hotel (located in York) * York Motor Lodge info on Discover South Carolina (located closest to trail) Category:Hiking trails in South Carolina Category:Protected areas of Cherokee County, South Carolina Category:Protected areas of York County, South Carolina Category:Mountain biking venues in the United States Category:Long-distance trails in the United States Category:Rail trails in South Carolina Category:Parks in South Carolina Category:Transportation in York County, South Carolina Category:Bike paths in South Carolina Category:Urban planning in the United States Category:Horse trails ","title":"Triple C Rail Trail"},{"id":"42730651","text":"Tom Pokel (born September 2, 1967) is an American professional ice hockey coach and a former ice hockey defenseman.

In 2001, he moved from Bietigheim to Schwenninger ERC of the German top-flight Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), joining the Wild Wings as an assistant coach. On April 30, 2002, he was promoted to head coach. Pokel and the Wild Wings parted ways in October 2002. Following a short stint as assistant coach at ERC Ingolstadt, he left Germany for Austria, serving as head coach of VEU Feldkirch, guiding the team to winning the championship in Austria's second division Nationalliga, EHC Lustenau, Graz 99ers and EK Zell am See. In 2009, Pokel was appointed as head coach of Italian Serie A club SG Pontebba. He would guide the team to three playoff appearances in his three years at the helm. He signed with fellow Serie A side Kanguro Alleghe Hockey for the 2012-13 campaign. Pokel then led HC Bolzano to the EBEL Championship in their inaugural season of the Austrian Hockey League in the 2013–14 season. Pokel joined the Vienna Capitals of the Austrian Hockey League (EBEL) on May 26, 2014. He parted company with the Capitals in February 2015. Pokel returned to Bolzano for the 2015-16 campaign and stayed on the job until the conclusion of the 2016–17 season. On October 26, 2017, he was named head coach of the Straubing Tigers of the German DEL. International On the back of his successful season with Bolzano, Pokel was named the head coach of the Italy national ice hockey team for competition at the 2014 IIHF World Championship.

Description  Triphora trianthophoros is a small, terrestrial, semi- saprophytic orchid. The showiest member of its genus, T. trianthophora has 1-8 (often 3, thus the name) nodding flowers that are roughly 2 cm in size and sit atop stems 8–25 cm tall. Leaves are small (~1 cm X 1.5 cm) and typically dark green to purple. The orchid blooms from July through September, but is infamous for its elusive nature, with ephemeral flowers lasting for only several hours on a few days of the year. It has further been reported that populations across a region synchronize blooming on specific days, making observation of flowering specimens even more difficult. Several forms of T. trianthophoros exist, including forma albidoflava (Keenan) with white flowers, forma caerulea (P.M. Brown) with blue flowers, and forma rossii (P.M. Brown) with multi-colored flowers.  Habitat and Range  Triphora trianthophoros is native to the eastern North America, ranging from as far south as Panama and north through Central America and the central and eastern United States into Ontario. Despite its wide distribution, the species is rare throughout much of its range and has been given G3G4 (secured, but with cause for concern) conservation status by NatureServe. Triphora trianthophoros is usually found is mixed deciduous forests. Co-located species often include partridgeberry and beech trees.

It is located in the gazetted locality of Tantanoola about north-west of the city of Mount Gambier, only a few metres from the Princes Highway (Route B1) between Mount Gambier and Millicent. It is notable both as a paleontological site and as a cave diving site. Description and naming The cave is formed in 30-million-year-old Oligocene coralline limestone. The cave is a karst sinkhole and is largely filled with water. The surface depression is about long and wide. Beneath the surface it extends to a maximum length of and a width of . The name of the cave was changed on 23 April 1989 by the Government of South Australia from The Green Waterhole to Fossil Cave with the change being published in The South Australian Government Gazette on 4 May 1989. Fossils Since the mid 1960s, a variety of Pleistocene subfossil material of birds and mammals has been found and recovered by divers from the surface of a rockpile to a depth of about below the water surface. The probable accumulation mode was by animals drowning when they fell into the cave while attempting to use it as a source of drinking water. Dating of the subfossil remains indicated that their deposition occurred mainly between 15,000 and 40,000 years ago. As well as representing many living animals, examples of extinct species recovered from the cave include the birds Centropus colossus and Orthonyx hypsilophus, and the mammals Thylacinus cynocephalus, Thylacoleo carnifex, Propleopus oscillans, Macropus titan, Protemnodon anak, and the sthenurine kangaroos Procoptodon gilli, Procoptodon maddocki and Simosthenurus occidentalis. Exploration Fossils were first collected from the cave in 1964 followed by a further collection in 1968, a number of expeditions which were organised by the South Australian Museum from years 1968 to 1974 and an excavation carried out by the South Australian Underwater Speleological Society (SAUSS) in 1987. The cave's submerged extent has been surveyed at least three times including by the Flinders University Underwater Club (FUUC) in 1978, Allum and Garrad in 1979 and the SAUSS in 1987.

It consisted of German-Italian engagement along the German-French border with the intention of breaking through into France and the advancement along the French-Swiss border of the Rhône. In order to carry out the intended plan, Adolf Hitler met with the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on 18 May 1940 in Brenner Pass, Tirol to suggest the deployment of around 20 Italian divisions in southern Germany. The relocation of troops was estimated to take between 20 and 25 days. Fall Braun was not carried out, due to the start of Fall Gelb (English: Case Yellow) on 10 May 1940, which resulted in the occupation of Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium by the Germany Armed Forces. By the beginning of July 1940, Fall Gelb had run its course and the north of France had also fallen into German hands. From this point, the newly planned Fall Rot (Case Red) was to take place, involving the occupation of central France from the north. From 5 June 1940, Fall Rot was successfully carried out, during which a severely attenuated variation of Fall Braun took place using only German troops. For this campaign, Army Group C was deployed, Fall Rot contrastingly having been completed by Army Groups A and B. Army Group C was successful in breaking through the main French line of defense, the Maginot Line. With the cease fire of 25 June 1940, all fighting was stopped. 1945 plan Fall Braun also refers to a German support operation during the Battle of the Bulge (1944/1945).

Evidence shows that sex between men is significantly underreported in surveys due to social desirability bias. Behaviors Various sex positions may be performed during sexual activity between men. =Anal sex= The penetrating man on the right is the \\"top\\" and the receptive man on the left is the \\"bottom\\" in missionary position. Historically, anal sex has been popularly associated with male homosexuality and MSM. Many MSM, however, do not engage in anal sex, and may engage in oral sex, frottage or frot, or mutual masturbation instead. MSM may also engage in different forms of oral sex, such as fellatio, tea bagging, and anilingus. Wellings et al. reported that \\"the equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike,\\" whereas an online survey of 18,000 MSM in Europe \\"showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place.\\" A 2011 survey by The Journal of Sexual Medicine found similar results for U.S. gay and bisexual men. Kissing a partner on the mouth (74.5%), oral sex (72.7%), and partnered masturbation (68.4%) were the three most common behaviors, with 63.2% of the sample self-reporting five to nine different sexual behaviors during their last encounter. Among men who have anal sex with other men, the insertive partner may be referred to as the top, the one being penetrated may be referred to as the bottom, and those who enjoy either role may be referred to as versatile. Pleasure, pain, or both may accompany anal sex. While the nerve endings in the anus can provide pleasurable feelings, an orgasm may be achieved through receptive anal penetration by indirect stimulation of the prostate. A study by the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB) indicated that men who self-report taking a receptive position during anal sex in their last encounter were at least as likely to have reached orgasm as men who adopted an insertive role. A study sampling single people in the U.S. indicated that orgasm rates are similar among men across sexual orientations. With regard to pain or being uncomfortable during anal sex, some research indicates that, for 24% to 61% of gay or bisexual men, painful receptive anal sex (known as anodyspareunia) is a frequent lifetime sexual difficulty. Two men engaged in frotting by rubbing their penises together Reports pertaining to the prevalence of anal sex among MSM have varied over time, with some percentages higher than others.Center for Disease Control, Increases in Unsafe Sex and Rectal Gonorrhea Among Men Who Have Sex With Men – San Francisco, California, 1994–1997. Retrieved April 29, 2007.Laumann, E., Gagnon, J.H., Michael, R.T., and Michaels, S. The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States. 1994. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (Also reported in the companion volume, Michael et al., Sex in America: A Definitive Survey, 1994). A large percentage of gay and bisexual men self- report lifetime participation in anal sex. Studies among gay men have indicated that percentages are similar when comparing men who prefer to penetrate their partners to those who prefer to be the receptive partner. Some men who have sex with men, however, believe that being a receptive partner during anal sex questions their masculinity. =Non-penetrative sex and sex toys= There are a variety of non-penetrative sex practices. Frot is a form of male-male sexual activity that usually involves direct penis-to-penis contact. It is a form of frottage. Frot can be enjoyable because it mutually and simultaneously stimulates the genitals of both partners as it tends to produce pleasurable friction against the frenulum nerve bundle on the underside of each man's penile shaft, just below the urinary opening (meatus) of the penis head (glans penis). Intercrural sex is another form of non- penetrative sex that can be practiced between MSM. Docking (the insertion of one man's penis into another man's foreskin) is also practiced. MSM may use sex toys. According to an online survey of over 25,000 men who self-report a homosexual or bisexual orientation, 49.8% have ever used vibrators. Most men who had used a vibrator in the past reported use during masturbation (86.2%). When used during partnered interactions, vibrators were incorporated into foreplay (65.9%) and intercourse (59.4%). =BDSM= A nationally representative survey carried out in Australia from 2001 to 2002 found that, in the 12 months prior to the survey, 4.4% of gay men and 14.2% of bisexual men participated in BDSM-related sexual activities, and 19.2% of gay men and 36.4% of bisexual men used sex toys. A non-representative, questionnaires- based survey on the sexual behavior of American students published in 1997 found 24% of gay and bisexual men had experience with spanking as a sexual practice.Elliott, Leland / Brantley, Cynthia, Sex on Campus, 1997, Random House, New York Among medicine students in North America, 6% of gay men and 17% of bisexual men reported ever receiving pain for sexual pleasure, and 5% of gay men and 9% of bisexual men reported inflicting pain for this purpose. Health risks A variety of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can result from sexual activity. A 2007 study reported that two large population surveys found \\"the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women.\\" Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Worldwide, an estimated 5–10% of HIV infections are the result of men having sex with men. However, in most of the Western world, more HIV infections are transmitted by men having sex with men than by any other transmission route. In the United States, gay and bisexual men accounted for 70% of 38,739 new HIV diagnoses in 2017. Of the 5,164 people diagnosed with HIV in the UK in 2016, 54% were gay or bisexual men. This statistic is decreasing in London as reported by Public Health England in 2017. Syphilis is passed from person to person through direct contact with a syphilis sore; mainly on the external genitals, the vagina, or anus. In 2006, 64% of the reported cases in the United States were among men who have sex with men.Syphilis & MSM (Men Who Have Sex With Men) – CDC Fact Sheet , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention A rise in the incidence of syphilis among MSM has been seen in other developed nations. Contracting syphilis increases the rates of HIV contamination and vice versa, and accordingly a survey in the US has indeed found that half MSM with syphilis also possess HIV. Some studies utilizing convenience samples have concluded that such rise can be attributed to increased rates of sex without a condom among MSM, though at least one study using a nationally representative sample has found that condom use rates among MSM have increased, not decreased, in the last decade, and there has been a steep decline in the frequency of anal sex in the last sexual encounter of active MSM. According to a US survey, HIV, syphilis, and anal warts are both significantly more common among men who recently had sex with men (MSM) than among men who recently had sex only with women (MSW). On the other hand, genital herpes is less common among MSM than among MSW. Chlamydia, human papillomavirus, gonorrhea, and lice saw no significant difference across the two groups.

Many prominent figures that have emerged in Egypt were of Lebanese origin, such as the world-famous actor, Omar Sharif (born Michel Chalhoub), and the highly acclaimed Egyptian filmmaker, Youssef Chahine. Most Lebanese who resided in Egypt were highly educated, and the community as a whole contributed to both Egypt's cultural and financial well being, especially during the era of the Muhammad Ali dynasty. Since the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, most of Egypt's Lebanese community left the country immigrating to the Americas, Europe, and Australia, as well as many returning to their native Lebanon (especially Beirut). The height of Lebanese immigration into Egypt occurred between the 19th and early 20th centuries. As Lebanon was part of Ottoman Syria during this time, Christians from all over the Levant (modern-day Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine) were immigrating to Egypt as one \\"Shawam\\" (شوام), or \\"Levantine\\" group. Hence, an umbrella term for their community is \\"Syro-Lebanese\\". The number of Lebanese Christians in Egypt grew drastically during the 1860 Lebanon conflict, in which thousands of Christians were killed along with hundreds of their villages destroyed. The vast majority of Lebanese and other Levantine migrants who arrived in Egypt were well-educated and French-speaking. The historic Lebanese community of Egypt, especially during the 19th and early 20th centuries, was almost exclusively Christian (Melkite Greek Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Maronite Catholic), with small numbers of Muslims and Jews among them.

Named after its capital in the town of Frysztat (now Fryštát district of the town Karviná, Czech Republic), it was part of Silesian Voivodeship, and existed from October 1938 until German Invasion of Poland in September 1939. The county had four towns: Frysztat, Bogumin Nowy, Karwina and Orłowa. In early October 1938, the government in Warsaw sent an ultimatum to Prague, demanding the return of the region of Zaolzie, which the Czechs had annexed in 1919-20. Czechoslovak government agreed, and units of the Polish Army entered the region, annexing an area of 801.5 km2 with a population of 227,399 people. Polish government divided Zaolzie into two counties - Frysztat and West Cieszyn. On October 27, 1938, Frysztat County officially became part of Silesian Voivodeship, on the same day, West Cieszyn County was merged with Cieszyn County. On January 31, 1939, Frysztat County was expanded by the gminas of Gruszów, Hermanice, Michałkowice, Radwanice and Ostrawa Śląska. Also, some smaller territorial changes were introduced.

It was published in quarto in London, 1633. The drama is written in blank verse, interspersed with lyrics; Druids, poets, and a harper are introduced, and it ends with a masque and chorus. Publication It was published by Robert Allott in 1633. The title page describes it as, \\"Fuimus Troes, the True Trojans, being a story of the Britaines valour at the Romanes first invasion. Publickly presented by the gentlemen students of Magdalen College in Oxford. Quis Martem tunicâ tectum adamantinâ Dignè scripserit?\\". London, printed by I.

Trojan myth The title derives from a line in Virgil's Aeneid, \\"Fuimus Troes, fuit Ilium et ingens / gloria Teucrorum\\" (We were Trojans, this was Ilium and the mighty glory of the Teucrians). The play's title, \\"we were Trojans\\", refers to the legend that both the Britons and the Romans were descended from the survivors of ancient Troy, through Aeneas. In the context of the Protestant culture of the time, the play seeks to validate an opposition between Britain and Rome, setting up the British as eternal enemies of Roman authority. The descent of the British from Aeneas's grandson Brutus of Troy is portrayed as a fact well known to Caesar. The British leader Cassibelan attempts to appeal to their common ancestry, saying \\"As you from Troy, so we, our pedigree do claim; / Why should the branches fight, when as the root's the same?\\". The martial prowess of the Britons continually linked to their Trojan ancestry, and they are depicted worshipping the same classical gods as the Romans. However, the common Trojan origin is set against a model of pan-Celtic identity, with the ghost of the Gallic warlord Brennus, who sacked Rome in 387 BC, supporting the Britons. In order to integrate the Trojan mythology Fisher has to reconcile contradictions between Caesar's own account of events and the story as presented by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the principal source for the Trojan-origin story. To achieve this, Fisher splits Androgeus and Mandubratius into two separate characters, though \\"Androgeus\\" is simply Geoffrey's own version of the latter's name. Characters *Mercury *Brennus *Camillus *Julius Caesar *Volusenus *Quintus Laberius Durus, called Labienus *Atrius *Comius Atrebas *Cassibelan (Cassibelanus), king of Britain *Mandubratius, king of the Trinovantes *Cingetorix, Kentish lord *Carvilius, Kentish lord *Taximagulus, Kentish lord *Segonax, Kentish lord *Androgeus, son of Lud *Tenantius, son of Lud *Nennius, brother of Lud *Belinus, a British nobleman *Hirildas, nephew of Cassibelanus *Eulinus, nephew of Androgeus *Cridous, king of Albania *Britael, king of Demetia *Guerthed, king of Ordovicia *Lantonus, a druid *Hulacus, a druid Plot The ghosts of the Gallic leader Brennus and his Roman antagonist Camillus discuss the long-standing conflicts between their peoples as they watch Caesar preparing to invade Britain. Nennius of Britain exhorts the Britons to defend their island from the Romans. Caesar explains his plans to his men, justifying the invasion because the Britons had helped the Gauls to resist him. In Britain, Druids call on the gods for aid. Meanwhile, Eulinus, a British warrior, discusses with his friend Hirildas his infatuation with Landora, a woman of the Trinovante clan. The British tribes unite under Cassibelan; the king of the Scots sends Pictish warriors to aid the Britons. The ghost of Brennus appears to Nennius to inspire him to heroic deeds. After the Romans land Cassibelan tells Caesar that he should not be attacking his kinfolk in Britain, but Caesar says he must expand Rome's power. The Britons beat off the Romans. In hand-to-hand combat with Caesar, Nennius is wounded, but he takes Caesar's sword from him. Humiliated, Caesar flees. Nennius starts to feel weak, and realises that the sword was poisoned. Still, he summons enough energy to fight and kill Labienus. The Britons celebrate their victory, but Nennius dies of his wounds, exhorting the Britons to \\"protect this isle, confound all foreign plots\\". At his funeral, a fencing match between tribal champions leads to the death of Cassibelan's nephew Hirildas at the hands of his friend Eulinus. Eulinus is horrified and tries to kill himself, but is stopped. Cassibelan demands that the killer be punished, but Eulinus' uncle Androgeus, refuses. Androgeus joins with Mandubratius, king of the Trionovantes. The dispute leads to a war between the tribes. Mandubratius, angry with Cassibelan, visits Caesar and persuades him to invade again. Caesar builds up a mighty force and allies with the Trinovantes. Despite valiant resistance Cassibelan is forced to admit defeat. Eulinus learns that his beloved Landora has taken poison because of the conflict. In despair, he stabs himself. With Eulinus dead Androgeus agrees to reconcile with Cassibelan, who agrees to pay a tribute to Rome. Caesar tells Androgeus and Mandubratius to acknowledge Cassibelan as king of all the Britons. The ghosts of Brennus and Camillus return with the god Mercury. They debate the relative merits of the Britons and the Romans. Brennus insists that only a Caesar could beat the Britons, and that should Rome ever become tyrannous \\"generous spirits will break this compact like a spider's web\\". Mercury predicts that Britain's embrace of \\"the world's fourth empire\\" will usher in an age of universal peace. Attribution The attribution to Fisher is generally accepted, but it has sometimes been argued that the play predates Fisher's career at Oxford and may have been written as early as 1603. The fact that one of the songs is in a Scottish dialect has been interpreted as an attempt to please the Scottish king James VI, who had become king James I of England in 1603.Roberta Florence Brinkley, Arthurian Legend in the Seventeenth Century, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, 1932, p.92. Fisher became a student in 1607, and could have written it at any time in James' reign after that date. The pro-Scottish passages, including the song are the main reason for the view that it dates from before James' death in 1625.

Chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and malignant wounds can have an enormous impact on an individual’s quality of life with pain being one of the most distressing symptoms.Price, P., Fogh, K., Glynn, C., Krasner, D. L., Osterbrink, J., & Sibbald, R. G. (2007). Managing painful chronic wounds: the wound pain Management Model. International Wound Journal, 4(s1), 4-15. The pain experienced by individuals with chronic wounds can be acute or chronic. Acute wound pain is intermittent and exacerbated by manipulation of the wound during procedures such as dressing changes or debridement. Chronic wound pain is present for six months or more and occurs without any manipulation of the wound. Chronic wound pain is persistent and exists at rest. Persistent pain is used interchangeably or to replace the term chronic pain. Intermittent or continuous pain that is present for three months or more is considered as persistent pain. Persistent pain is also referred to as neuropathic pain.Sussman, C., & Bates-Jensen, B. (2007). Management of wound pain. Wound Care: A Collaborative Practice Manual for Health Professionals. 3rd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Depending on the sensation associated with neuropathic pain, it may be considered as acute or chronic. Acute neuropathic pain is associated with burning, squeezing, throbbing, shooting, or electric shock sensations that resolve. Neuropathic sensations such as numbness, tingling, and prickling are considered as chronic neuropathic pain. Chronic neuropathic pain may be intermittent or continuous, and may remain unresolved post tissue healing.  Classifications Nociceptive pain is a physiological response described as stabbing, throbbing, aching, or sharp. Nociceptive pain is considered to be an appropriate to painful stimuli that occurs as a result from underlying tissue damage and may be acute or chronic. Nociceptive pain that is persistent may due to conditions causing ongoing tissue damage such as ischemia, or edema. Neuropathic pain is associated with chronic pain and results from a nervous system dysfunction, which causes an inappropriate response to pain. Neuropathic pain is described as burning or tingling persistent pain. Three types of nociceptive pain are experienced with chronic wounds; cyclic acute wound pain, non cyclic acute wound pain, and chronic wound pain.Krasner, D. (1995). The chronic wound pain experience: a conceptual model. Ostomy/wound management, 41(3), 20-25. Cyclic acute wound pain may be experienced in conjunction with chronic wound pain and occurs during regular routines such as dressing changes or repositioning. Noncyclic acute wound pain is intermittent and usually occurs during procedures such as sharp debridement. Chronic wound pain is described as acute or chronic. Acute pain is nociceptive pain that serves as a warning to prevent mechanical, chemical, and thermal injuries. Acute pain is relieved when the damaging source is reduced. Chronic pain has physical and emotional components and is rarely an indication of ongoing damage. In order to effectively manage wound pain, the type of wound pain must be determined to facilitate pain relief. Neuropathic pain may require different interventions and medications than the traditional analgesics, which are effective in the treatment of nociceptive pain.  Assessment and cause  Verbalization of pain is considered the most valid indicator of pain because pain is subjective and whatever the individual complaining of pain says it is. Standardized tools that have been validated in the assessment of pain are commonly used to assess wound pain are; Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Numeric Box Scale (NBS), Faces Pain Rating Scale (FRS), and The Short McGill Pain Questionnaire, which may be difficult to use with patients who are unable to verbalize and describe their pain. The Wound Pain Management Model (WPMM) was developed to outline the important components of wound pain assessment. The WPMM indicates wound pain assessment should include; location, intensity, duration, and the impact on quality of life. Chronic wound pain has been under recognized and often goes untreated, or undertreated. Contributing factors for poor wound pain management are lack of, or inadequate wound pain assessment. Negative consequences of chronic wound pain may be impaired quality of life due to sleep deprivation or disturbances, immobility, depression, changes in body image, constipation due to side effects of pain medications, infection, and stress. Chronic wound pain can have a cause sleep disturbances or deprivation, depression, immobility, and changes in body image, infection, stress, and constipation due to side effects of pain medications can have a negative impact on the quality of life. Chronic wound pain may vary depending on the cause of the wound. Venous leg ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, malignancy, infection, inflammation and stress are associated with chronic wound pain.  Venous leg ulcers  Venous leg ulcers are commonly associated with chronic wound pain. The pain prevalence rate for venous leg ulcers is 50-87%. The pain experienced with venous leg ulcers may be constant, or intermittent varying in intensity. Venous leg ulcers may cause nociceptive and neuropathic pain, and ultimately be expressed as persistent background pain. Venous leg ulceration is due to poor venous return and venous hypertension as resulting from venous reflux or obstruction.1 Consequences of venous leg ulcers are infection, cellulitis, and infection. Venous leg ulcers can affect mobility and ultimately quality of life.  Arterial ulcers  Arterial ulcers can cause nociceptive pain as a result of peripheral ischemia. Atherosclerosis causes arterial insufficiency and occlusion, which contribute to the development of arterial ulcers. The pain with arterial ulcers may be increased when the affected extremity is elevated, and decreased when the affected extremity is in a dependent position.  Diabetic foot ulcers  Diabetic foot ulcers affect 15% of people living with diabetes mellitus and cause 50% of non-traumatic amputations of the lower extremities. The pain experienced by individuals with diabetic foot ulcers can be described as burning, tingling, and shooting sensations due to diabetic or peripheral neuropathy. More than half of the individuals who undergo an amputation as a result of a diabetic foot ulcer undergo a second amputation within five years.  Pressure ulcers  Pressure ulcers are caused by unrelieved pressure or friction and shear in combination with pressure. The pain experienced with pressure ulcers can be excruciating and may occur at rest and with dressing changes. The pain associated with pressure ulcers may be due to ischemia, friction, shear, infection, neuropathy, poor nutrition, muscle spasm, moisture, incontinence, immobility, and deep tissue injury.  Malignant wounds  Malignant or fungating wounds are caused by proliferation and infiltration of malignant cells into the skin and the surrounding lymphatic vessels. Malignant wounds can be painful and cause isolation due to the effect on self-esteem due to changes in body image as a result of malignant wounds.Seaman, S. (2006, August). Management of malignant fungating wounds in advanced cancer. In Seminars in oncology nursing (Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 185-193). WB Saunders.  Infection  Infection results when the wound’s micro-organisms overcome the immune system’s natural defense to fight off replicating micro-organisms. Chronic wounds that persist for more than 12 weeks should be evaluated for delayed healing, increase exudate, foul odor, additional areas of skin breakdown or slough on the wound bed, and bright red discoloration of granulation tissue, which may be indicative of infection.

Her notable works include Their Eyes Were Watching God: A Dance Adventure in Southern Blues (A Choreodrama), an adaptation of Zora Neal Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, as well as productions of why i had to dance, spell #7, and for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf, with text by Ntozake Shange. She has won numerous honors for her work including an Emmy nomination, three Bessie Awards, and a Helen Hayes Award. She is a member of the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, and the Dramatists Guild of America. Early life and education McIntyre was born in Cleveland, Ohio to Dorothy Layne McIntyre, the first African-American woman to be licensed by the Civil Aeronautics Authority, and Francis Benjamin McIntyre. At the age of four, McIntyre began studying ballet under the tutelage of Elaine Gibbs after seeing Janet Collins in the Metropolitan Opera Company's Cleveland production of Aida. As a teenager, she studied modern dance with Virginia Dryansky. In 1964, McIntyre graduated from John Adams High School before attending Ohio State University. There, she first studied French with plans to become a linguist with the United Nations, but she became a dance major during her third year after taking a dance history course with Shirley Wynne. McIntyre recalled, \\"In my third year, I said, I have to stop fooling myself. [...] The dance-history courses really shifted me to say, Yes—go for it if that’s what you want to do.\\" During her time at Ohio State, the university commissioned her to choreograph for an evening with Lucas Hoving, Doris Humphrey, and Anna Sokolow. In 1966, McIntyre attended the American Dance Festival where she would later return as a member of the faculty in the early 1990s and in 2008. Career While taking graduate courses at Ohio State University, the head of the dance department, Helen P. Alkire put McIntyre's name up for a position at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where McIntyre was then hired. There, she choreographed for a year before moving to New York City in 1970. In New York, McIntyre studied under Viola Farber and Gus Solomons Jr. among others. At a workshop with Anna Sokolow, the Nikolais Dance Theater, Judith Dunn, and Bill Dixon she found herself drawn to the connection between dance composition and avant-garde jazz and free jazz. She began to attend the rehearsals of jazz musicians, such as the Master Brotherhood, where she taught herself how to move to jazz. Her frequent attendance at the Master Brotherhood rehearsals earned her the nickname the \\"Cancer Dancer,\\" because she was born in July. McIntyre cites \\"a feeling of that time in the Black Arts Movement\\" as the source of her passion for combining dance and live jazz. She explained that \\"many of us artists who were black, in whatever our particular field, we had a consciousness about what our work was saying for the moving forward of the consciousness about our race and our place in the society.\\" Upon moving to New York in 1970, McIntyre performed with the Gus Solomon Jr.'s dance company for 2 years. McIntyre held her first solo concert at the Clark Center for the Performing Arts. Under the mentorship of Louise Roberts, the director of the Clark Center, McIntyre founded the Harlem studio and company, Sounds in Motion, in 1972. She then held concerts at the Cubiculo Theatre and Washington Square Church while supporting her endeavors out of her own pocket. = Sounds in Motion = During this time, she worked part-time at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts in the dance collection. Upon advice from others, McIntyre began applying for grants in order to fund her project when Sounds in Motion joined the National Endowment for the Arts dance-touring program. Sounds in Motion performed at venues such as the Joyce Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, and John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, as well as touring in Europe. During this time, works by Sounds in Motion included Life’s Force (1979), created in collaboration with Ahmed Abdullah while Sounds in Motion was in residency, Take Off From a Forced Landing (1984), which was based on her mother's experiences as an aviator, and a performance in 1986 based on Zora Neal Hurston's 1937 novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God. During the 1970s and 1980s, Sounds in Motion was the only modern dance studio to be found in Harlem. The studio was a space where what McIntyre termed \\"the culture crowd,\\" a label that included not only dancers and musicians, but scholars, activists, and artists from all fields, could gather and engage in furthering movement of Black consciousness. Many students who studied under McIntyre at the Sound in Motion studio went on to accomplish much in their own right, including Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, founder of Urban Bush Women. Sixteen years after its founding, McIntyre closed Sounds in Motion in 1988 to pursue independent work. McIntyre is credited with encouraging renewed interest in the work of modern dance pioneer Helen Tamiris through a recreation of Tamiris' 1937 masterpiece, How Long, Brethren? in 1991. As a freelancer, McIntyre choreographed the Broadway productions of Mule Bone (1991), the original and revival of Paul Robeson (1988 and 1995 respectively), and King Hedley II (2001). Off-Broadway, McIntyre also choreographed Obie Award winner Ntozake Shange's Spell #7 at The Public Theatre, and for London's West End, she choreographed King, the Musical. Her choreography has also been featured on television in HBO's Miss Evers' Boys (1997), for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography, and in the 1998 film Beloved, based on the novel of the same name by Toni Morrison. PBS profiled McIntyre in their 2001 three-part documentary, Free to Dance, a co-production between of the American Dance Festival and The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. In 2011, McIntyre acted as choreographer for the film Fun Size. In 2012, Sounds in Motion reunited at the American Dance Guild Festival where they performed Life's Force with Ahmed Abdullah. That same year, she choreographed Crowns at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. McIntyre has been a guest artist and teacher at numerous institutions including the American Dance Festival, Jacob's Pillow Dance, and the Bates Summer Dance Festival. She has also been on the faculty of Sarah Lawrence College. =Collaboration with Ntozake Shange= Ntozake Shange first met McIntyre as a student and performer at McIntyre's dance company, Sounds in Motion. Since then, the two of them have collaborated on a number of works including The Public Theatre's 1979 production of Shange's Spell #7, in the 2007 New Federal Theatre's festival Ntozake Shange: A Retrospective, Shange's one-act play, It Hasn't Always Been This Way, and in 2012, Shange's choreopoem, and why i had to dance, produced by Oberlin College and Cleveland’s PlayhouseSquare. Before the premiere of why i had to dance, McIntyre joined Shange in her talk at Oberlin discussing Shange's 2011 work, lost in language & sound: or how I found my way to the arts. In 2013, Barnard College's Africana Studies Program and Consortium for Critical Interdisciplinary Studies hosted a two-day conference titled The Worlds of Ntozake Shange. At the event, McIntyre and Shange discussed their work together and the legacy of their collaboration. In 2014, McIntyre returned to Barnard to hold a movement workshop for a course on Ntozake Shange's work and influence. In the fall of 2014, McIntyre will be choreographing a new choreopoem by Shange to be premiered at the Brooklyn and Kelly Strayhorn Theatre in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The tournament draws club teams and national teams from many countries around the world, including New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, England, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Australia. The competition began in 1989, as the Territory Sevens, with the inaugural event being won by Fijian team, Duavata. The tournament was re-branded as the Hottest 7s in 2005, and has been supported by the Northern Territory Government since 2009. The organisers in 2013 claimed it was the richest rugby sevens tournament in the Southern Hemisphere with a prize pool of $65,000. Format The tournament attracts around forty to fifty teams each year. As of 2014, there were thirty-two men's teams and eight women's teams. In the men's competition the top eight teams are seeded and eight pools of four teams each are drawn, with each team playing all others in their pool once. The top two teams from each pool advance to the Cup/Plate bracket, and the bottom two teams from each group enter the Bowl/Shield bracket.

Early life Born in Edinburgh in December 1821, Patterson was educated as a civil engineer at Edinburgh high school. When quite young he started in the printing-office of his cousin, John Ballantyne, as a press corrector. In 1852 he left the printing business to become editor of the Edinburgh Advertiser. London newspaper editor In 1858 Patterson moved to London as editor, and later proprietor, of The Press, owned by Benjamin Disraeli, after the death in 1857 of David Trevena Coulton. George Henry Townsend took it over from him about 1865. About that year Patterson may have become involved with The Globe, which he ran at some point with Francis Mahony and E. B. Moran (or E. R. Morgan). A London evening paper, it took a Conservative line.Dorothy Deering, The London \\"Globe\\" of the 1840s and 1850s, Victorian Periodicals Newsletter No. 11, [Vol. 4, No. 1] (Feb. 1971) , pp. 28–29. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press on behalf of the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20084876 The details, however are not clear. The editors of this period, during the 1860s, of The Globe included: Charles Wescomb; Henry Barnett, minister of South Place Chapel; Patterson; and Marbrook Tucker.Sheila Rosenberg, Some Further Notes on the History of the \\"Globe\\": Its Editors, Managers, and Proprietors Victorian Periodicals Newsletter No. 15, [Vol. 5, No. 1] (Mar. 1972) , pp. 40–47, at pp. 44–45. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press on behalf of the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20084930 Later life Patterson resigned from The Globe in 1869, to join a board appointed by parliament to investigate and report on the purification of coal-gas in London. The outcome was a process for the elimination of sulphur and ammonia impurities from gas. In 1872 Patterson went to Glasgow as editor of the Glasgow News, but his health broke down and he returned to London in 1874. He went on contributing articles, on politics, finance, science, and history, to periodicals. A reputed financial expert, he was consulted by both the Bank of England and the Bank of France on financial and currency questions, and was elected a fellow, and afterwards a member of council, of the Statistical Society. As a financial journalist he belonged to the generation of Hyde Clarke, David Morier Evans and William Newmarch, who debated abstract finance; their successors were Walter Bagehot, Arthur Crump, Arthur Ellis and Robert Giffen, concerned rather with realistic reporting on the City of London.S. G. Checkland, The Mind of the City 1870–1914, Oxford Economic Papers New Series, Vol. 9, No. 3 (Oct. 1957), pp. 261–278 at p. 269. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2661797 Patterson died at Hammersmith on 13 December 1886. He had married, in 1848, Georgina, daughter of Captain Thomson of Perth. Works Patterson was the author of: * The New Revolution; or the Napoleonic Policy in Europe, Edinburgh and London, 1860. A review in The Economist identified it as edited from published leaders and articles from The Press and Blackwood's Magazine; and as hostile to Napoleon III.

The episode was written by Rebecca Sonnenshine and directed by Michael Allowitz. Plot The episode starts with Damon (Ian Somerhalder) having captured a traveler and interrogating him to tell him where Markos (Raffi Barsoumian) is so he can find Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Elena (Nina Dobrev) but the only thing the traveler tells him is that it does not matter if he find Markos since he has whatever he needs and it is too late to do anything. Meanwhile, Stefan and Elena are tied up and being drained by Markos who needs their blood for his spell. A woman appears and frees Stefan who goes and frees Elena and they escape. Stefan calls Damon to tell him that they escaped but he does not know where they are and they will try to find their way back home safe. They are walking down the road discussing when a car appears. The driver stops to pick them up and it is Maria (Tamara Austin), one of the travelers and the one who freed Stefan. Elena and Stefan wonder why she is helping them and Maria tells them that her husband, Julian, is inside Tyler's (Michael Trevino) body permanently and that means when Markos finish the spell, Julian will die since Tyler's body is a hybrid. She wants to find her husband and run away. Enzo (Michael Malarkey) keeps bothering Damon to keep his promise and bring him back to life. He also pesters Bonnie (Kat Graham) since she is the one who is able to do it. Bonnie asks Damon to make Enzo stop but instead he tells her that since she is working with Liv (Penelope Mitchell) on a spell to keep her alive when the Other Side collapses, they should include Enzo as well to the spell and save him too. Caroline (Candice Accola) comes to Bonnie with an idea of how to save Tyler; they can kill his body so the traveler will go and Tyler passes to the Other Side and then bring him back with the spell that will bring Bonnie back too. Bonnie cannot lie anymore and she admits to Caroline that there is no spell and that she lied about it, something that Enzo also hears and he is mad about it. He demands from Bonnie to find a way and when she tells him to give up he says he will never give up as long as the Other Side still exists and he is there. Meanwhile, Damon tries to make Markos appear and he steals all the travelers' bodies from the cave, leaving a note to Markos to come and find him. Markos does and he appears at the Salvatore house where he explains Damon his plan and that by threatening him that he will destroy the bodies will not work since the bodies are not essential to his plan. To prove it, he kills one of the travelers. Damon tries to attack him but Markos knocks him out and tells him that he is not strong enough to kill him since he is full of doppelganger blood and he channels the power of all the travelers. Julian, who is chained at the basement, hears the two talking and tells Damon that Markos does not know he is there and they should take advantage of that. Elena, Stefan and Maria arrive at Mystic Falls but Liv and Luke (Chris Brochu) ambush them and by using magic they cause their car to crush. Maria dies and Elena and Stefan try to get away from them. Liv and Luke want to kill at least one of them so the travelers will not be able to complete the spell that will strip away all the magic from Mystic Falls. In the meantime, the travelers started the spell and Liv and Luke start losing their magic power. Elena and Stefan's rings also stop working and they start getting burned by the sun. They run and hide to avoid the sun and head to find Damon, Caroline and the rest. Maria's spirit appears to Bonnie to pass to the other side and asks Bonnie to tell Julian that she tried to save him. Back at the Salvatore house, Julian tries to help Damon to take Markos by surprise and he attacks him by biting him. Markos pushes him away while Julian's fangs disappear because of the spell that the travelers already started. Damon's ring stops working as well and the wound of the gunshot that killed him appears on his chest. Damon and Julian run away to get out of the range of the spell so they will not die. Caroline tries to pack their things and leave the dorm and while Bonnie should be doing the same, she just sits without doing anything. Caroline asks her why she is not helping and Bonnie says that she might found a way to bring them back to life but she needs Enzo's help. Enzo finds Maria at the Other Side and she asks her if she knows the spell the travelers used to bring Markos back and Maria says she does and she is willing to help them, but with the Other Side falling apart, Maria is drawn away by the force that draws away the people from the Other Side. Enzo and Bonnie lose their only chance to manage to bring the ones they need back in life. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) finds Damon running in the street and picks him up and they go and find Stefan, Elena, Caroline and Matt (Zach Roerig). Matt and Jeremy decided to go back to Mystic Falls while the rest should try to get as far away as they can. Damon and Elena leave with Jeremy's car while Stefan and Caroline stay behind to wait for Bonnie. Julian appears and asks about Maria. Stefan tells him that Maria is dead and Julian starts a fight with Stefan where he ends up killing him by ripping his heart out. Julian says that that is the way to stop the spell and leaves, while Caroline is in shock crying over Stefan's body. The episode ends with Stefan appearing to Bonnie so he can pass to the Other Side. Bonnie is aghast seeing him and she cannot believe that he is dead. Stefan asks to tell him that she found a way to bring them all back, Bonnie tells him that she did but she lost it and then Stefan passes through her to the Other Side.  Feature music  In the \\"Promised Land\\" episode we can hear the songs: *\\"Don't Let Me Go\\" by Raign *\\"I'll Be Honest\\" by The Privates *\\"Future Bolt\\" by Hotpipes *\\"Bad Blood\\" by Bastille *\\"Cherry Licorice\\" by The Felice Brothers *\\"The Truth in You\\" by The Garden District *\\"Torture\\" by Rival Sons Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Promised Land\\" was watched by 1.50 million; down by 0.34 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Promised Land\\" received positive reviews. Stephanie Flasher of TV After Dark gave an A rating to the episode saying that \\"despite being the season's penultimate episode, \\"Promised Land\\" very much had the feeling of a season finale with drama, suspense and an epic cliffhanger.\\" Ashley Dominique from Geeked Out Nation gave an A- rating to the episode. \\"The stakes got grave and desperate as the travelers took hold of Mystic Falls in \\"Promised Land\\". All of this setting up an extremely tension filled finale.\\" Carrie Raisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating focusing on Stefan's death and saying: \\"It hurts me to spend all that time debating something that only took up about one minute of actual episode space—especially because everything else here was so good. This episode was downright hilarious at times, light and breezy and snappy in a way the show hasn’t been in quite a while, and it was an absolute pleasure to watch. [...] It’s well-plotted, well-written, tight stuff. Right up until that insane ending. Which all might be a big misdirect.\\" Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4/5 saying that the end left her pretty speechless. \\"We all know that death doesn't exactly stick when it comes to The Vampire Diaries but the other side is disintegrating slowly before our eyes. Bonnie and Enzo's plan to use Maria is now kaput since Maria vanished into the darkness. Now what?\\" Liane Bonin Starr from HitFix gave a good review to the episode and saying that the end was shocking and the season finale will be explosive. Starr also praises Trevino's portrayal as Julian: \\"It's still a little unnerving to see Caroline talking to Julian when he's inhabiting Tyler's body. Kudos to Michael Trevino for making Julian distinct as a character, and making his reaction to Maria's death — yanking out Stefan's heart — both wrenching and utterly believable.\\" Stephanie Hall of K Site TV also gave a good review to the episode saying: \\"\\"Promised Land\\" served as an amazing set up for the finale, ensuring that everything that could go wrong at this point did go wrong. For all of the drama that took place, there was a surprising amount of comedy that was utilized in the beginning of the episode in order to create a more radical shift in tone once the Travelers began their spell. It left off with quite an unexpected cliffhanger that further compels the audience to tune in next week to see how this will all play out.\\" References External links * * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 5) episodes ","title":"Promised Land (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"42731755","text":"Modular sofa system designed by Don Chadwick and produced by Herman Miller.

Directed by Rd Ariffien and R Hu for Union Films, the film was written by Saeroen. The film, which stars Zonder and Soelastri, tells of a young man who convinces a stingy hadji to be more charitable and, in the process, falls in love with the man's daughter. Released during Eid al-Fitr, Harta Berdarah was advertised as a \\"magnificent Indonesian action hit\\" and used Zonder's silat skills and Soelastri's fame as a keroncong singer to draw audiences. Reviews for the work were positive, with praise focused on its acting and story. Although Harta Berdarah was screened as late as 1944, as with most contemporary productions it is now likely lost. Plot In the village of Soekasari, Mardjan (Oedjang) is forcefully evicting people who are unable to pay their taxes to his boss, the landlord Hadji Doerachman (Moesa). Doerachman, though aware of this, is unwilling to stop him, even after his daughter, Atikah (Soelastri), tries to convince him. Mardjan and his men evict Asmadi, his wife Tjitjih (RS Fatimah), and Asmadi's sick mother. When Asmadi resists, Mardjan beats and detains him. Meanwhile, a young man named Rachmat (Zonder) is visiting his aunt in Soekasari. Learning of Mardjan's dealings, Rachmat finds him at Doerachman's home and insists that Mardjan stop. When Mardjan and his men try to fight, Rachmat overpowers them and negotiates Asmadi's release. Afterwards, Rachmat goes back to his aunt's home. Asmadi returns to his, only to learn that his mother had died shortly after the eviction; he swears revenge. One day, Rachmat hears screaming and finds Atikah, who has fainted after seeing a snake. After she regains consciousness, Atikah thanks him for rescuing her. Although Rachmat is disgusted that he has helped her after learning the identity of Atikah's father, as Rachmat and Atikah dedicate their time to social work, they begin to fall in love. Doerachman, however, disapproves of their relationship, and refuses to fund their work; as a result, Atikah takes her deceased mother's jewellery and some money to pay for village development. Later, when Rachmat and Atikah are sitting together and singing romantic songs, Mardjan overhears them. Hurrying back to Doerachman's home, Mardjan convinces his boss that Rachmat intends only to steal Doerachman's wealth, and to let Mardjan marry Atikah. As Doerachman prepares to leave, Mardjan has the illiterate hadji put his seal on a letter. In preparation for her marriage to Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As they had all worked in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but respect him. This, and the extent of the developments, makes Doerachman realise that hoarding his wealth for himself does not make him as happy as using it for charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, hurry back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on the front porch. After he is accosted by Doerachman, Mardjan reveals that the letter which Doerachman signed was actually a statement granting Mardjan all of the hadji's wealth. Furious at Mardjan's behaviour, Asmadi attacks him while Rachmat restrains the others. After a lengthy knife fight, Mardjan's foot is caught in the railroad tracks, and he is soon killed by a passing train. Doerachman, pleased with the return of his wealth, destroys the letter and grants Rachmat permission to marry Atikah. Production A scene showing Rachmat fighting Mardjan's men; the actor, Zonder, was skilled in martial arts. Union Films was established in 1940 by ethnic Chinese businessmen Ang Hock Liem and Tjoa Ma Tjoen. After the success of its first production, Kedok Ketawa (The Laughing Mask), the director Jo An Djan left for Populair's Film. Union hired new talent, including R Hu, Rd Ariffien, and Saeroen. All three were instrumental in the production of Harta Berdarah; Hu and Ariffien served as co-directors, both in their debuts, and Saeroen—who had written the commercial successes Terang Boelan (Full Moon; 1937) and Fatima (1938) for other companies—wrote the story.; Ariffien credited their hirings to Union's interest in attracting educated Native audiences. Harta Berdarah starred Soelastri and Zonder, and featured Moesa, Oedjang, Oesman, Haroen, and Abdullah. Many of these actors, including Soelastri and Fatimah, had had roles in Kedok Ketawa, and Moesa, though only recently signed, had previously acted for another company. Zonder, who made his film debut in Harta Berdarah, was well-versed in the traditional martial art of silat, while Soelastri was also known as a keroncong singer under the stage name Miss Ning; both made use of these skills for the film, which was scored by Hugo Dumas' musical troupe Lief Java.; ; Cinematography for the production was handled by KH Tjit. Release and reception Harta Berdarah was released in late October 1940, to coincide with the Eid al-Fitr holiday. The film, sometimes advertised under the Dutch title Bloedgeld, was billed as a \\"magnificent Indonesian action hit\\".; A novelisation, published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning, was later released; it includes several production stills. Reception was positive. An anonymous review in De Indische Courant concluded that the film was simple yet well produced, with strong dialogue and humour. Another review, in the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, was likewise positive; it found the film dissimilar to earlier domestic productions, in which \\"a group of stiff people moved woodenly and expelled inarticulate sounds\\", becoming something which could be enjoyed by anyone, \\"Indonesian or European alike\\". Legacy After Harta Berdarah, Union produced a further five films; all but one were directed by Hu or Ariffien. Saeroen wrote three of them, leaving for Star Film following Wanita dan Satria (1941). Most of the cast remained with Union for several productions; the company's subsequent production, Bajar dengan Djiwa (1941), for instance, again starred Zonder and Soelastri. Union Films was ultimately dissolved following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in March 1942. Harta Berdarah was screened as late as July 1944. The film is likely lost. All motion pictures at the time used highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, many films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and the film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that some Japanese propaganda films can be found at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

The company specializes mainly in coffee, cocoa and cotton. ECOM has more than 40 offices located in over 35 countries all around the world. It is one of the largest coffee millers in the world. With over 170 years of market experience, ECOM Agroindustrial Corp. Limited is committed to sustainable and socially responsible leadership within the soft commodities industry. ECOM’s global operations rely on extensive knowledge and experience in supply chain traceability, risk management and client focused distribution to create a valuable and sustainable supply chain, starting from the local farmers and their communities through to the world’s leading finished-product manufacturers. ECOM leads by example within the commodities community, by working closely with its counterparties and stakeholders as they seek to enhance farmers’ livelihoods and their environments. ECOM publishes its Supplier Code of Conduct, Modern Slavery Statement, reforestation initiatives and Environmental Policy on its website at: https://www.ecomtrading.com.  History  ECOM was founded in 1849 by Jose Esteve as a cotton trading business in Spain. The Esteve family subsequently themselves established in the US in 1885 following developments in cotton farming. They expanded into Brazil in 1935 and in Mexico in 1948. ECOM was soon established and joined coffee trading in 1959 and cocoa in 1991. In 2000, ECOM bought the London- based coffee business of the Cargill company. In 2012, ECOM purchased 13 million 60-kg bags of coffee or about 7% of the world's coffee. In 2013, ECOM announced the purchase of the commodity trading division of Armajaro Holdings, taking over its coffee, cocoa and sugar business.Marcy Nicholson (11 November 2013), \\"Armajaro selling loss-making commodity trade arm to Ecom\\", Reuters Retrieved 12 May 2014.Isis Almeida (12 November 2013), \\"Armajaro Trading Sold to Ecom After Loss of $7.6 Million\\", Bloomberg, Retrieved 12 May 2014. ECOM has subsidiaries in several countries, including Sangana Commodities in Kenya.  Supply chain issues  A recurrent issue in agricultural large-scale production are human rights violations, there have been spurious allegations against ECOM as well. For example, the investigative NGO Repórter Brasil scrutinized the labour conditions on coffee farms in Brazil in 2016 and found evidence of multiple abuses: Advances never paid were discounted from salaries and the employer irregularly subtracted absences from pay slips, even for rainy days, when harvesting was impossible. Because of these practices, some workers were being paid monthly amounts below half of the minimum wage. The coffee from these farms was also sold to a direct subsidiary of ECOM. Company response: The ECOM Group has never owned or administered coffee farms in Brazil. ECOM responded to the 2016 report referred to clearly at the time. For reference, in 2016, 2 of the farms the subject of the report were within a Rainforest Alliance group certificate for which the certification is managed by the ECOM Group. ECOM was in compliance with and fulfilled its Rainforest Alliance group certificate obligations and responsibilities as manager. Although all issues identified were rectified or resolved at the relevant time, the two farms have not been part of ECOM’s certification group since 2017. The ECOM Group has taken, and continues to take, important steps to combat modern slavery which may exist in commodity supply chains. It is a fundamental policy of the ECOM Group to conduct its business with honesty and integrity and in accordance with the highest legal and ethical standards. In particular, in Brazil, ECOM supports different initiatives to improve work conditions, being a member with Cecafe of InPacto (http://inpacto.org.br), a national institute for the eradication of modern slavery work conditions in Brazil.

In November 1822 he commissioned Beethoven to write string quartets. He wrote in French from Saint Petersburg to the composer: > Being as passionate an amateur as an admirer of your talent, I am taking the > liberty of writing to you to ask you if you would be willing to compose one, > two or three new quartets. I shall be delighted to pay you for the trouble > whatever amount you would deem adequate. Beethoven agreed to this, requesting 50 ducats for each quartet. He had not written a string quartet since his Op. 95 in 1810. In 1823 he was occupied with writing his Ninth Symphony, and he began serious work on the quartets in 1824. The first of these, the String Quartet No. 12 in E flat major, Op. 127, was given its first performance by the Schuppanzigh Quartet in March 1825. The quartet later performed the other two works commissioned, the String Quartet No. 13 in B flat major, Op. 130 and String Quartet No. 15 in A minor, Op. 132.The early performers of the quartets of Beethoven Elias String Quartet: the Beethoven Project, accessed 10 April 2014. Beethoven received the fee for the first quartet; although the prince acknowledged his debt for the other quartets, it was not paid in the composer's lifetime, the matter being finally settled with Beethoven's heirs in 1852. =Other associations with Beethoven= The prince was an intermediary in the sale of a copy of Beethoven's choral work Missa solemnis to the Russian court; it was through him that the first performance of the work took place in St Petersburg in April 1824.

The episode serves as the first of a two part episode for the third season finale and was written by David H. Goodman & Robert Hull and directed by Ron Underwood. In this episode, everyone in Storybrooke joins Mary Margaret and David as they prepare to give their newborn son a coronation, while the time traveling portal that Zelena created before her demise comes to life, and takes Emma Swan and Captain Hook back to the Enchanted Forest before the events of the original curse. Emma and Hook must find a way to return to Storybrooke. But in their quest to return, they accidentally ruin Snow and Charming's first meeting, and they must repair the timeline with Rumplestiltskin's help before it is too late to undo the damage. Plot =Opening Sequence= Zelena's time travel portal opens in the Enchanted Forest. =Event chronology= The Boston flashbacks happen years after \\" Awake\\" and before \\"Breaking Glass\\" while the Enchanted Forest past events happen after \\"A Tale of Two Sisters\\" and changing the events of \\"Snow Falls\\" and before \\"There's No Place Like Home\\". =In the Characters' Past= In the past (our world) a young girl leaves with a couple in a car from an adoption agency, where an eleven-year-old Emma SwanAccording to \\"Selfless, Brave and True\\", Emma came to Storybrooke in October 2011 (the moment August started turning into wood, as stated in \\"The Stranger\\"). This was her 28th birthday, according to \\"Pilot\\". Season Two and the first half of Season Three takes place a few months later, and the second half of Season Three takes place one year later, in 2013. In \\"The Tower\\", David says that it's been nearly thirty years since Emma was born. This means that Emma has not turned 30 yet. The flashback takes place 18 years earlier. is standing, looking upset that she'll never have a perfect family, but the foster manager comes up to her and tells Emma, \\"Don't worry, you'll find a home too, Emma.\\" =In Storybrooke= In the present day, Emma looks happy and sees Mary Margaret holding her baby boy as she prepares for the upcoming coronation even though they haven't named him yet. Henry is looking for apartments and both Henry and Mary Margaret ask Emma what she thinks. Emma changes the subject and starts thinking why her parents are trying to expand the time they need to name the unnamed baby by using an age-old tradition. Meanwhile, Regina and Robin Hood are sharing some romantic time together. She tells him about how TinkerBell told her about them being soulmates, how she saw the lion tattoo but didn't approach him in the pub. However, Robin is happy to hear that, saying it must be the right time for them now. Later on at Granny's, everyone is recalling or retelling stories of how Mary Margaret and David originally met back in the Enchanted Forest and how they kept running into one another and were destined to be together. When Emma reveals her desire to return to New York City with Henry in an attempt to leave Storybrooke behind, Regina and the others exclaim in protest. Suddenly Gold notices an orange beam rising in the distance, which he tells them is the time portal. As this starts to happen, Emma tells everyone that she wants to go back to New York City and everyone including Regina doesn't like the idea. Emma then walks out and Hook follows her, taking the fairytale book with him. Meanwhile, Regina, David, Belle, Gold, Robin, and Mary Margaret visit the jail to see if Zelena had died around the same time as the portal's opening. They see on the jail's surveillance video that she committed suicide, but are unaware that Gold altered the video to make it look like she killed herself. As they stop by the park, Emma tells Hook that she is confused about going back to New York City. Hook then hands Emma the book, telling her Henry hoped it would remind her where they're from. The conversation is cut short when they notice the time-travel orange beam forming and Emma runs towards the barn, where the doors burst open. The beam pulls Emma towards the vortex, and Hook tries to hold her back by digging his hook into the ground with Emma holding onto his leg. Emma can't hold on and is immediately sucked into the portal. Hook says \\"One of these days I'm going to have to stop chasing this woman,\\" and jumps in after her. The portal closes as her cellphone, which is left behind in the barnyard, is ringing with a call from David, who was trying to warn her. =In the Enchanted Forest's New Past= Seconds later, both Emma and Hook land in the Enchanted Forest. It turns out that, while going through the portal, Emma was thinking of her parents' first meeting, which is how and where they ended up. The two then come across the wanted signs for Snow White from the past and then stumble onto a village, where they see Regina terrorizing the villagers demanding that they tell her where her stepdaughter is. Regina proves that she is not kidding by having a woman arrested for helping Snow. Emma wants to help the woman, but Hook warns her about changing the future so they can't save the woman, since the villagers that were threatened by The Evil Queen included Pinocchio, Gepetto, and Granny. Around the same time, both Prince James (Charming) and Abigail are in the carriage in the moments before Snow and James are due to meet. Snow cuts a tree down to make her highway robbery, causing the carriage to stop as she is in a tree waiting. As Charming gets out the carriage to investigate, Emma makes the biggest mistake in altering the timeline by making an accidental noise and surprises Snow, who falls and runs aways, empty handed without taking the jewels from the carriage, and preventing her parents from meeting for the first time. Emma discovers that she interfered the past and realizes that the only way to stop this altered timeline is by seeking out the only person capable of correcting this mistake, namely Rumplestiltskin. As the approach Rumplestiltskin's castle, Rumplestiltskin himself appears out of nowhere ready to kill Hook (as he still holds a grudge after Hook stole his wife, Milah, and took the magic bean Rumplestiltskin was going to use to find his son, Baelfire) but Emma then reveals to him that he will create the curse that he hopes will one day find his son Baelfire, and killing Hook will further destroy the timeline. As the pages in the book start to become blank, time is starting to run out for Emma to fix what she has done, and Rumplestiltskin tells her the only way to correct this is to go to the ball that will be held at King Midas' palace. Seeing that Snow wants passage after failing to secure one from Blackbeard, they hatch a plan to have her steal the ring for passage out of the forest by using Hook’s ship, which means they have to pay a visit to the tavern to distract a past version of Killian Jones, so Hook sends Emma to distract the Past Hook while he's drinking with his mates. The Future Hook suddenly becomes jealous of Past Hook for flirting with Emma, as she keeps Past Hook occupied while Future Hook offers Snow a deal, but things get out of hand when Smee first becomes confused by the difference in his captain, and second when Past Hook shows up while Future Hook is still there. Emma orders him to leave, and Hook looks on jealously as the Past Hook comes on and kisses her. The Future Hook then taps his previous life on the shoulder and punches him. Hook replies that he was asking for it, saying that he'll blame the rum for his actions. Later that night at Midas' palace, Emma and Hook watch to see what happens when Rumplestiltskin appears. He gives them an invitation and alters their looks so they can blend in. As they enter the palace, Emma gives them the aliases \\"Princess Leia\\" and \\"Prince Charles\\" in front of King Midas, and as they take a waltz together they see James and Abigail together but she doesn't want to dance with James. The Evil Queen arrives at the palace to ask Midas to search the place just in time for Snow to show up and take the ring. As expected, James captures Snow, altering the timeline of the first time they met (and she hits him, this time with a jewelry box instead of a rock). As she makes her escape, Emma sees her running and James yelling at her to stop and saying that he'll find her (another altered timeline in their encounter), only to have Emma (who finds the ring left behind by Snow and hides it from plain view) get caught by Regina and arrested. The story continues in the following episode.

It is set to the tune of \\"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\\" and the Dambusters March. It was released to coincide with the 2006 FIFA World Cup.  History  Boardman came up with the idea of writing his own World Cup song because he thought that some of them were \\"lousy\\". He then wrote the song and designed a CD cover for it and contacted a friend of his to help record it. The song was first performed in Liverpool on 28 April 2006. Boardman stated that if the song made it to no. 1 in the UK charts, he would donate half of the profits to charity. The song's line \\"The Germans bombed our chippy\\" was based on a real incident when Boardman's local fish and chip shop was destroyed by a bomb dropped by the Luftwaffe in the Liverpool Blitz.  Charts  The song was released in late May 2006. It made its debut in the UK Singles Chart at 19 before rising to 15 the next week. The song initially placed above England's official World Cup song World at Your Feet. In the UK Indie Chart, the song reached number 1 in the week beginning 5 June 2006.  Reception  The Football Association received the song negatively because they didn't want to support any song perceived as \\"anti-German\\". It was reported that Liverpool players Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard with former Liverpool player, Michael Owen sang the song during an England national football team training camp coach. Singer Tony Christie described the song as \\"just a vehicle for Stan and his German 'jokes'\\". In 2010, Boardman released an updated version of Stan's World Cup Song entitled \\"Stan's World Cup Song – Africa 2010\\" for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with the CD sales going to Help for Heroes.

During the match between Congolese football clubs TP Mazembe and Vita Club, missiles were thrown onto the pitch and the referee chose to delay play. Fifteen people lost their lives after police launched tear gas into the stands causing a stampede. A police source who declined to be named put the death toll higher, at 18. Governor Andre Kimbuta said at least 24 other people were injured during the melee that followed. Supporters were said to have been blinded by the gas, with the panic and confusion contributing to the collapse of a stadium wall. Suffocation was reported to have been the cause of death in most instances.

This allows for temperature measurements and thermal analysis to be performed on intricate and inaccessible components, which operate in harsh environments. Like thermal barrier coatings, THCs provide protection from intense heat to the surfaces on which they are applied. The temperature range that THCs provide accurate temperature measurements in is 900 °C to 1400 °C with an accuracy of ±10 °C.J. P. Feist, J. R. Nicholls, M. J. Fraser, A. L. Heyes (2006) \\"Luminescent material compositions and structures incorporating the same\\" Patent PCT/GB2006/003177 Application of THCs THCs are applied by atmospheric plasma spraying, which is a thermal spraying technique. This ensures that the coatings are robust to allow long life-times in harsh environments, such as on jet engine components, which experience temperatures in excess of 1000 °C and angular velocities of up to 10,000rpm (revolutions per minute). Temperature Measurement =Phosphorescent Properties= THCs are composed of phosphor materials, whose luminescent characteristics are temperature- and duration-dependent. Phosphor thermometry is the measurement technique used for determining the past temperatures of THCs, whereby the luminescent characteristics of the coatings are exploited and matched to calibration tables. Temperature mapping across surface of heated disc =Instrumentation= The phosphorescence of THCs is excited by use of an external light source such as a laser pen. An optical system then collects a reflected light signal, whose characteristics provide information on the crystal structure of the THC. Crystal structure properties are then converted into temperatures, which had previously been experience by the coatings. This allows for point measurements to be made across the coated surfaces of components and allows thermal analysis to be carried out. Applications =R&D;= THCs are used in high temperature applications where temperature knowledge is essential in research and development programmes, for example in identifying hot spots, which could lead to structural damage of components. =Warranty= As the THCs provide historic temperature information, they can be used as warranty tools, where certain components, such as valves or particular engine or machinery components must not exceed certain temperatures.

Political career Weal served as deputy leader of the Social Credit Political League from 1970 until 1972. He worked as a teacher at St Peter's College in Auckland where one of his students, Stefan Lipa was influenced by him in social credit theory and later became the Social Credit Party President between 1979 and 1987. Another of his students was John Tamihere later a Member of Parliament (1999–2005) (for the Labour Party) and a cabinet Minister (2002–2004). Tamihere was considerably influenced by Weal. Weal stood as a Social Credit candidate in numerous elections (usually in the electorate of Mt Albert), as well as in by-elections in Fendalton and Hutt in 1967 and 1968, respectively. He was notably misquoted with regards to comments on unemployment during the 1968 Hutt by-election. Weal was sent by Social Credit leader John O'Brien to the United Kingdom in 1971 in an effort to stop that country from joining the European Economic Community (EEC), which Social Crediters in New Zealand were deeply concerned about. In Britain, Weal stated that the British public was not aware of the damage that New Zealand would suffer if Britain joined the Common Market without safeguards for her primary produce. He spent three weeks talking to anti-market groups in England. He promoted a special arrangement for New Zealand if Britain entered the EEC. Weal said he had found that very few people knew exactly what joining the EEC meant for Britain. He thought that that was why there was a great fear of going into Europe at the time. He said: \\"The public just doesn't know what's going on in Brussels. For this reason they're interested in hearing the Commonwealth view on the negotiations and that's what I've tried to express.\\" Weal was invited to return to Britain and was urged to bring a member of the New Zealand Labour Party with him. \\"We wouldn't be here to play politics, but just to let people know what's in it for us if Britain joins the EEC\\", he said. He rejected the idea that he was \\"meddling\\" in British politics. \\"In fact one of the most successful things I did was to deliver a letter outlining New Zealand's objections to British membership to every MP before the Common Market debate\\", he said. Weal thought that letter had an influence in the fact that more than 100 Labour members signed a petition opposing the entry negotiations.NZPA Staff Correspondent, Britons in Dark about EEC Says Mr Weal, New Zealand Herald, 25 January 1971, p. 5. Weal quit the Social Credit Political League with O'Brien in 1972 and joined the New Democratic Party. That party unsuccessfully contested the 1972 election. Weal was later involved with the short lived Christian Democrat party in the 1980s. Weal died on 29 October 2016 in Auckland and was buried at Hautapu Cemetery, Cambridge.

He was among the pioneers in the study of heredity whose vision paved the way for the research of Gregor Mendel, the founder of modern genetics. Biographical notes Christian Carl André was born on 20 March 1763 in the German town of Hildburghausen.Christian Carl André, Moravian Museum He studied at the University of Jena, and worked as a teacher in Eisenach and at the Schnepfenthal Salzmann School in Gotha. Then from 1798 to 1820 he lived in Brno, then within the Habsburg empire, where he headed the Evangelical Lutheran school; published the newspaper Patriotisches Tagebuch (Patriotic Notebook); and edited a weekly journal Oekonomische Neuigkeiten und Verhandlungen (Economical News and Essays).Vítězslav Orel (2009), The “Useful Questions of Heredity” before Mendel, Journal of Heredity, Volume 100 Issue 4, Pp. 421-423 During this period he was a leading figure in the Moravian Agricultural Society, promoting applied scientific research particularly in the field of sheep-breeding. He then moved to Stuttgart, where he published the Landwirtschaftliche Zeitschrift (Agricultural Journal) and acted as an adviser to the ruler of Württemberg. He died on 19 July 1831. Scientific significance In his 1795 textbook on zoology, André showed his understanding of how the characteristics of both parents contribute to those of a new individual, as against the older concept of preformation. In 1815 he drew up a research programme for the Moravian Agricultural Society, stressing the need for basic and applied research in natural science. In many journal articles he disseminated the progress being made, within this Society and in England, on scientific animal and plant breeding. He was instrumental in setting up a sheep-breeding section within the Society - the first animal-breeding association in continental Europe - which investigated methods of artificial selection and the transmission of traits of wool from parents to offspring, i.e. heredity. André addressed in detail the problem of how and in what circumstances inbreeding was liable to lead to weakening of the organism. In 1819 he demonstrated a recently designed micrometer for evaluating wool quality, recognised as marking \\"the beginning of a new epoch of scientific breeding defined with mathematical precision\\" His son Rudolf (1792–1827) also studied the theory and practice of sheep-breeding. The environment of scientific enquiry he helped to foster in the Habsburg empire soon become famous in Europe, and nurtured further work in animal and plant breeding, precursor to the groundbreaking work of Gregor Mendel.Vítězslav Orel (1996), Heredity before Mendel, excerpt from Gregor Mendel—the First Geneticist, Oxford University PressVítězslav Orel (1996), Mendel and the Agricultural Society of Brno, excerpt from Gregor Mendel—the First Geneticist, Oxford University Press  References  Category:19th-century biologists Category:Austrian Empire people Category:1763 births Category:1831 deaths Category:Austrian biologists ","title":"Christian Carl André"},{"id":"42732629","text":"This is a list of indigenous peoples speaking Halkomelem, or who did so historically (as most living members of those peoples no longer speak them).

Forbo Flooring Systems offers a broad range of floor coverings and building and construction adhesives. Forbo Movement Systems is specialized in power transmission and light conveyor belts. Forbo Holding AG based in Baar ZG is a globally operating Swiss manufacturer of floor coverings and building and construction adhesives as well as power transmission and light conveyor belts. The group has an international network of 26 locations with production and sales, as well as 46 pure sales organizations in a total of 36 countries. Forbo has 5'700 employees and achieved a turnover in 2018 of 1,327.0 million Swiss francs. The company is listed on the SWX Swiss stock exchange ().  Areas of activity  Forbo has two divisions: Forbo Flooring Systems and Forbo Movement Systems. The Flooring Systems division is specialized in linoleum, vinyl floor coverings, entrance matting systems, carpet tiles, needle felt coverings and Flotex. These are used, among other things, in public buildings, hospitals, schools, business premises and in the home. Forbo is the worldwide market leader in linoleum. Forbo sells the material under the trademarked name of Marmoleum. Under the brand name Eurocol, Flooring Systems also offers ready-to-use adhesives for laying floor coverings and ceramic tiles, as well as filling and leveling compounds for the construction industry. Movement Systems is specialized in power transmission belts, transport and process belts, plastic modular belts as well as toothed and flat belts of synthetic materials. The products are sold under the brand name of Siegling and are used in a wide range of areas in industrial, trade and services companies, for example as process belts in the food industry, as treadmill belts in fitness studios or as flat belts in mail distribution systems.  History  Forbo was founded in 1928 by a merger of three linoleum manufacturers in Germany (Deutsche Linoleum-Werke A.G., Berlin), Sweden (Linoleum Aktiebolaget Forshaga) and Switzerland (Linoleum AG Giubiasco) under the company name of Continentale Linoleum Union. According to the company's own information, at the time it represented \\"80 % of linoleum production in continental Europe.\\" In the following year the group was joined by the Nederlandsche Linoleumfabriek (Netherlands), and later by other companies from Austria, France and Latvia. Towards the end of the 1930s the DLW left the union due to political circumstances. From the 1950s on, the company began to diversify its business activities into other areas such as carpets and vinyl floor coverings. At the start of the 1970s the adhesives area was separated from the linoleum business and continued independently. At the same time the name of the company was changed from Continentale Linoleum Union to Forbo. In the subsequent two decades Forbo grew to become a global concern working on all five continents. The company made various acquisitions and extended its business activities to the areas of wall coverings and high-pressure laminates. In 1994 Forbo took over Siegling, a company specialized in power transmission and light conveyor belts based in Hanover, Germany. In the second half of the 1990s, the areas wall coverings and laminates were phased out. In 2000 the group realigned itself strategically in the four areas of linoleum, vinyl, synthetic belts and adhesives, and then made several smaller acquisitions to reinforce its adhesives business. The industrial areas, including extrusion profiles, decoration products and coated textiles, were phased out, while the carpet activity was sold in a management buy-out. In the first half of the 2000s, the adhesives activity was further extended internationally by the takeover of the company Swift with operations in the USA, Europe and Asia. The plastic belts division was also extended in Great Britain. The linoleum and vinyl activities were fused with Forbo Flooring, and at the same time the three strategic divisions of floor coverings, adhesives and plastic belts were formed. Production takes place at two locations in Krommenie (Netherlands) and Kirkcaldy (Scotland). 2006: takeover of Victa Technologies, a Chinese adhesives manufacturers specializing in hotmelt adhesives and water-based adhesives. 2007: new branding and growth strategy; the three core divisions are renamed Flooring Systems, Bonding Systems and Movement Systems, and pursue an integrated corporate strategy under the umbrella brand Forbo. In 2012 there is a concentration on the market leading market positions Flooring Systems and Movement Systems. The activities of Bonding Systems with the industrial adhesives (including synthetic polymers) are sold off. Building and construction adhesives are continued as a separate unit within the division Flooring Systems.

The presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. In South Korea it was also used, \\"perhaps as a double dose\\" to induce abortions. When first made available for sale in the UK in 1959, the pregnancy test in use involved injecting toads with a woman's urine. It was withdrawn from sale in the UK in 1978. Primodos was produced by Schering AG, a German company taken over by Bayer AG in 2006. Another hormonal pregnancy test called Duogynon was in use in Germany during the same general time period.  History  In the 1960s, Dr. Isabel Gal conducted research at Queen Mary's Hospital for Children that showed a link between use of the drug and severe birth defects. A review by the Committee on Safety of Medicines in the 1970s concluded that the product should not be used by pregnant women. Litigation in the 1980s regarding these claims ended inconclusively, with proceedings being discontinued, with the court's approval.\\"Jury still out in pregnancy test case\\", New Scientist, 8 July 1982, page 79 A review of the matter by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date, and concluded that it found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive. The report of an expert working group of the UK Commission on Human Medicines published in November 2017 concluded there was no “causal association” between Primodos and severe disabilities in babies. The expert group recommended that families who took a hormone pregnancy test and experienced “an adverse pregnancy outcome” should be offered genetic testing to establish whether there was a different underlying cause. Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review An independent review by Baroness Cumberlege, the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, reported in 2020 that \\"avoidable harm\\" resulted from the use of Primodos. It recommended that \\"the Government should immediately issue a fulsome apology on behalf of the healthcare system to the families affected by Primodos\\". Dr Bill Inman, of the Committee on Safety of Medicines, who had investigated Primodos was referenced in a Schering memo stating \\"...he has destroyed all the material on which his investigation is based, or made it unrecognizable, which makes it impossible to trace the individual cases taken into the investigation. I understood Dr. Inman that he did this to prevent individual claims from using this material.\\" Baroness Cumberledge said, in relation to Bayer, \\"I think they should not only apologise; they should recognise what has happened and give ex-gratia payments to these people who have suffered.\\"  References   Further reading  * Category:Tests for pregnancy Category:Drugs with unknown mechanisms of action Category:Drug safety Category:German inventions Category:20th-century health disasters Category:Health disasters in the United Kingdom Category:Medical controversies Category:Medical scandals Category:Withdrawn drugs Category:History of disability Category:Abortifacients ","title":"Primodos"},{"id":"42732726","text":"Yona Kanamuzeyi (died 24 January 1964) was a Rwandan deacon and martyr.

Makumbi's writing is largely based on oral traditions. She realised that oral traditions were so broad and would be able to frame all her writing regardless of subject, form or genre. She has said she \\"noticed that using oral forms which were normally perceived as trite and 'tired' brought, ironically, a certain depth to a piece that I could not explain.\\"Bamuturaki Musinguzi, \\"Oral tradition pays off for Jennifer Makumbi\\", The East African, 20 June 2014.

The company was founded by Mark Erder and Adrian Brown in September 1991, and incorporated in Hong Kong in early 1992. Brown is a British reporter and Erder is an American documentary filmmaker. History APV started as a supplier of news reports to international broadcasters that did not have adequate resources in Asia. Thus, it addressed a news coverage gap in that area. It soon built relationships with client broadcasters in Britain, Europe, North America and Australia. Its earliest clients included CNN, ABC America, Sky, Fox News, and the major Australian Broadcasters TCN 9, Channel 7 and Channel 10. Mark Erder and Adrian Brown (Journalist) quickly recognized the importance of retaining all rights to their stories, a condition that enabled them to resell the same content to non-competing clients in other geographical markets. As the date for the Hong Kong Handover approached, new opportunities emerged for APV to expand its production services and to offer satellite uplink and outside broadcast services. Later, APV. and the BBC entered into a documentary co- production deal. With the decision to pursue further documentary projects and program development, the company split its business into two divisions; APV Broadcast Services that focused on the original news-focused services and APV Programming Division that dealt with documentary and feature programming. While news and documentary film production remained APV's core business, by 1993, the company had begun to attract corporate clients as well. With demand from corporate clients steadily increasing, the APV Corporate Services division was established to focus on the production of video news releases (VNR), marketing videos, and internal training videos and customized Media Training, for both PR Agencies and direct clients. Present Status APV currently delivers documentary programming to National Geographic, AETN and other broadcasters. In addition, it supplies commissioned content to major corporations across the Asia Pacific region including HSBC, Cathay Pacific Airlines, Swire Pacific Ltd, Shangri-La Hotels, Alibaba, UBS, Prudential and several others. Adapting to the changing economic and news climates of Hong Kong, today APV. is almost purely focused on corporate work and Branded content with producers specializing in the financial, hospitality, property and auction industries. Highlights In 1992, APV entered a five-year production contract with the BBC that led to a five-part series documentary, \\"The Last Governor\\". Later (in 1999) The BBC and APV entered into a co- production deal to produce another documentary project, a history of foreign correspondents in Asia entitled \\"Of All The Gin Joints\\". By 1997, APV hired more than 120 employees., and had been commissioned by 20 broadcasters from around the world, to cover the end of colonial rule in Hong Kong. APV provided video production services and local expertise to networks from Germany, Austria, Australia, Britain, France, Canada and the United States, in that period. This led to the establishment of the company’s APV Operations Services division, that specialized in providing outside broadcast, uplink, and external facilities services. In 2002, the performance of this division led to the formation of a joint venture focused specifically on providing satellite news gathering services and APV Link, based in Singapore. This JV only lasted a few years The company’s performance in the corporate and broadcast markets have led many clients to seek APV’s guidance and production for the placement of their Branded Content. Both Hysan and The Grand Lisboa made corporate films with the intention of having them broadcast. The most successful placements were early productions for the Eastman Company which produced a half-hour show for placement on Chinese TV and for the US Department of Commerce which produced multi-part series for both the India and China markets, focusing on the benefits of a graduate education in the US. The most successful of these was a four-part series sponsored by Shangri-La Hotels and starring Zhang Ziyi. This was placed on NGCI and various in-flight entertainment channels for the CX and Singapore airlines APV. has played an instrumental role in the launching of the CNN Bureau in Hong Kong, and the Asian launches of Asia Wall Street Journal TV, ABN, CNBC and Fox.

Among the measures introduced was the use of school uniform for the first time in Dominican Republic and the respectful treatment of teachers and students, denoted by the standard to address the students with the title of \\"ladies\\", which counted the own students and teachers.

Biography Belenos was brought to life as a one-man-band by Loïc Cellier in 1995. Influenced by the early black metal scene of Norway, the music of the band always was and remains a mix of black and pagan metal with Celtic choirs. The original line-up consisted of Loïc (guitars, bass, vocals, programming) and Nathalie (guitars, lyrics). After releasing three demo tapes (in 1996, 1998 and 1999) Belenos turned into a full band and began to play live. The first live appearance took place in Lille, October 1999 as an opening act for Marduk and Enthroned. Yann Desaulty on bass was replaced by David Foulon, as well as Raphael Fontaine left the band due to a lack of motivation. In August 2000 the band signed with Sacral Productions and released the first full album Errances oniriques in March 2001. After a couple live performances Belenos recorded their second album Spicilège with the new drummer Marc Devillers, since Denis Sokowicz had been fired. The album was released again on Sacral Productions. The same year Marc Devillers was replaced by Gilles Delecroix. In 2004 Sacral Productions released a 2-CD demo compilation L'ancien temps. By the end of 2004 Belenos became a one-man-band and stopped all live activities. In 2006 Adipocere Records released the third album Chants de bataille on which Loïc had been working since 2002. Drums for the album, recorded in 2004, are provided by Gilles Delecroix, then a member of Aborted. In 2007 Belenos signed with Northern Silence Productions and the same year released the fourth album Chemins de souffrance which features some completely rerecorded versions of the songs from the second 1998 demo Allégorie d'une souffrance. In 2009 the debut full album Errances oniriques, completely rerecorded, was reissued by Northern Silence Productions. The new version contains two exclusive cover songs with lyrics reworked in French. In 2010 Belenos with three session members returns on stage to play four festivals in France. The next full length album Yen sonn gardis was recorded between December 2009 and April 2010 and mastered in June 2010 at the band's home studio. The album features the whole lyrics in Breton, an old Celtic language of Brittany. In early 2012 the second album Spicilège was reissued in a digipack format limited to 1000 copies and including new artwork, original remastered sound and seven bonus tracks. The final recording of the next studio album Kornôg was to start in January 2014, but it was postponed with no release date planned. Kornôg was released September 9th 2016.

The subject has been painted by several other anonymous masters of the Death of the Virgin. Art style The painting contains many key religious figures, as religious works were the most popular during the Middle Ages. Religious paintings would often be done as works of patronage to a church, especially during the early Middle Ages. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, however, it was common for works of art to include more aspects of secular life and create a more human connection to the painting. The fact that Mary is elderly as she would be at that point in her life is historically accurate. All apostles are present at the scene of her death, but neither Jesus Christ nor any angels appear in the work. Symbols in the work The artwork contains a few symbols in it. One of the symbols is the candle which the Virgin Mary can be seen holding. This is often a sign of the fact that Mary is still alive in the work. In other works the candle may be out, signifying she has passed. Around her bed are the twelve apostles, who appear to be in a kind of funerary ritual, as one can be seen reading from a book, another is sprinkling her with water, and another is holding incense. The bed also has a step, making it so that the viewer does not seem to out of complete reach of the Virgin Mary. Mary is also dying in a house or room, which has more in common with a fifteenth century home than a fifth century one. The Background of the story The Death of the Virgin is inspired by a legend which originated in the fifth century, as it is nowhere to be found in any book from the Bible. The legend is also known as the Dormition of Theotokos (“the one who gave birth to God”), and originated mostly likely in the Byzantine world, working its way westward into Europe. In the legend, Mary is visited by an angel, sometimes Gabriel, informing her that she will die soon. She is granted a wish in which she asks to be united with all twelve apostles when she dies. As such, the apostles are miraculously transported from all over the world to the place where the Virgin Mary is dying. Those who are dead are also transported, some appearing on clouds. The artist of the work has chosen to represent this aspect of the story, as all the apostles appear. However, the author’s choice to be more realistic has led to the fact that no angels are present at the scene.

Kelley and starring Francis X. Bushman, Jacqueline Logan and Guido Trento. Bushman plays Manuel Belgrano, the leader of the 1810 May Revolution. The film's Spanish title refers to a line from the Argentine national anthem. It was made as a patriotic endeavor designed to boost the small Argentine film industry, but with enough action and romance to appeal to international audiences particularly in the UK and the United States. The film is also titled The Beautiful Spy. Plot Belgrano (Bushman) is leading a revolt against Spanish rule. His sweetheart, Monica (Logan), the daughter of a Spanish loyalist, is acting as a spy and supplying information. Monica is captured and sentenced to be executed. Belgrano has to rally his supporters to free her. Cast * Francis X.

After failing to secure Hollywood backing for his project, he raised the finances elsewhere but decided to shoot in North America with a largely American cast in order to boost the film's chances of a good release there.Finkielman p.81 Bushman had been a major star during the silent era, although his career was starting to decline. Ajuria went to great lengths to recreate authentic costumes and settings of the period. During its production, the film was criticized by Argentine newspapers who felt that it would be another Hollywood-style retelling of Argentina's history, but these attitudes began to change once preview screenings were held.Finkielman p.81-83 Release The film premiered on March 10, 1928 at the Cervantes Theatre in Buenos Aires. It went on release in the United States in September the same year, distributed by FBO which shortly afterwards merged into the major RKO Pictures. The running time of the film was significantly cut down, and it was generally shown as part of a double bill. It was not successful, partly due to the arrival of sound which made silent films noncommercial. However, in Argentina it was exceptionally popular, and remained in release for two whole years. It was the most popular silent film ever released in the country.Finkielman p.84 Ajuria's hope that it would stimulate the creation of an Argentinian film industry, but this not immediately happen.Finkielman p.84-85 It was for many years considered a lost film, until its rediscovery and screening in 2013.

Background During his time as Entrepreneur in Residence, Lawrence uncovered very concerning patterns of behaviour which appeared to lead to the destruction of good and viable UK businesses. Lawrence called for further investigation into this behaviour by the appropriate authorities and immediate action to stop this unscrupulous treatment of businesses. The publication of the Tomlinson Report coincided with a Sunday Times investigation into the same issue, publishing their stories on the same date. Regulatory response The Financial Conduct Authority announced that they would undertake a section 166 investigation on 29 November 2013 and has since appointed Promontory Financial Services and Mazars to undertake the Skilled Person review. Lawrence continues to work with the FCA Skilled Person to aid their review which is due to report in Quarter 3 of 2014.

It is the penultimate station in SunRail's phase one. It opened May 1, 2014, and marks the nine-year return of regular passenger rail service to Sanford following the closure of the Amtrak station in 2005. Sanford station is the northernmost SunRail station within Seminole County. Sanford is typical of most SunRail stations featuring canopies consisting of white aluminum poles supporting sloped green roofs and includes ticket vending machines, ticket validators, emergency call boxes, drinking fountains, and separate platforms designed for passengers in wheelchairs. The station is located along the north side of S.R. 46, diagonally across the road from the Sanford Amtrak Auto Train station. Other Amtrak trains that share the right-of-way with SunRail are the Silver Meteor and Silver Star trains, neither of which stop at either Sanford station. The station is also located just south of Rand Yard, a small rail yard used by CSX for freight car storage as well as SunRail for equipment maintenance and storage. History The Sanford station was built along tracks originally laid down by the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad, which was acquired by the Plant System, and later by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL). Sanford's ACL Depot, however, was built along the tracks used by the South Florida Railroad, which was also acquired by the Plant System and later acquired by ACL. The original station was built by the ACL in 1913, and a new modern station replaced the original depot in 1953. As with many ACL Depots, it became a Seaboard Coast Line Railroad station when the ACL merged with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1967. Like most passenger stations, it was acquired by Amtrak upon its inception in April 1971. In December of that same year, the Auto-Train Corporation built a terminal for its operations nearby. Auto-Train took passengers and their cars and other vehicles to Lorton, Virginia, and later Louisville, Kentucky. Lack of success from the Louisville expansion, high crew costs and several accidents threw the company into bankruptcy, and Auto-Train Corporation was forced to end its services in late April 1981. Amtrak acquired Auto Train in 1983, and still operates this service between Sanford and Lorton today. In its waning years, the former ACL depot served the Silver Star, Silver Meteor, and Sunset Limited until Amtrak closed the station on August 1, 2005, leaving Auto Train as the only passenger service to serve Sanford. The abandoned 1953-era ACL station deteriorated through the years and was eventually demolished in 2009. In the meantime, the Central Florida Commuter Rail agency vowed to return passenger service to Sanford, and on May 1, 2014, the Sanford SunRail station was opened to the public.

Built about 1775, it is locally distinctive as one of only a few colonial-era houses, and is a well-preserved example of Georgian styling. It has also seen a number of socially significant uses, serving at times as a tavern, library, music school, and fraternal lodge. Surviving interior architectural details provide a significant view into the history of tavern architecture. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Jonathan Barnes House stands in the rural village of Hillsborough Center, on the east side of the triangular junction of Center and North streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior, and is oriented facing south. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by Tuscan pilasters and topped by a transom window and gabled pediment. Windows are rectangular sash with corniced caps; that above the entrance is smaller than the others. Two additions project from the east side of the main building, one of which is also of early construction. An 18th-century barn is located on the property to the north of the house. The interior of the house follows a typical center hall plan, with two rooms on either side of the main hall. The rooms on the west side of the hall have fixtures consistent with their use as a tavern, and the second-floor chambers above them have configurable partition walls, enabling the space to be turned into a single large ballroom. The house was built c. 1773-75 for the Rev. Jonathan Barnes, the first settled minister of the town. Local lore says that it was built by Isaac Baldwin, a local master carpenter who lost is life in the Battle of Bunker Hill, early in the American Revolutionary War. The house has seen a wide array of uses, including as a library (founded in 1797), music school, marching band facility (1825), and Masonic lodge. The tavern- related features of the interior are among the best-preserved of their type in the region.

Built in 1910, it is a prominent early work of Chase R. Whitcher, a noted architect of northern New England in the early 20th century. The building is the third town hall to stand on this site, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history Bedford Town Hall is located among a cluster of civic buildings at the junction of Bedford Center and Meetinghouse roads. It is a 2½ story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It seems to be Greek Revival in form, with a classical four-column temple front, but the proportions of the columns are out of scale with typical 19th century examples of the style, and there are other details (such as the oculus window in the gable) that borrow from other 19th-century styles. The columns support an entablature and gabled pediment, with the entablature extending along the sides of the building. The building corners have broad pilasters. The main entrance is at the center, flanked by sidelight windows set between pilasters, and topped by a transom window and corniced entablature. The site on which the town hall stands was the site of Bedford's first colonial meeting house, built in 1755. That building, originally built to house civic and religious functions, was used exclusively for civic functions from 1832 until 1876, when a new town hall was built on the site. That building was destroyed by fire in 1909. The present building was designed by Chase R. Whitcher, a native of Lisbon, New Hampshire, who studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Whitcher was then early in what would be a successful career, and this building is a relatively unusual example of his work. His use of Classical Revival features is not typically found on his later works, which include buildings in Manchester, and a wing of the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel in Dixville Notch.

Complex spatial images and light-shadow-projections were created using the simplest of means. However, light is not only a material, but also often a topic of Kowanz's works. For example, she has been engaged with the speed of light in a personal complex of works since 1989. A very small decimal number in neon figures indicates the time that the light needs to cover the length of this sequence of numbers.Riccardo Caldura, Adherence, Relational Openness: Reflections on Artwork and Context, in: Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien (publ.): Brigitte Kowanz. Now I See. Nuremberg: Verlag für moderne Kunst 2010, S. 226–232. One complex of issues that Kowanz has also been engaged in since the 1980s is that of language and writing and its translation into codes. Light is investigated as a space-forming medium as well as an information carrier and medium of knowledge and visibility. Since 1995, Kowanz has also regularly used the morse alphabet – based on simple dash-dot combinations – for coding purposes. As a binary code, it represents the origin of the transfer of information using light.Christian Reder, Light = Measure = Form = Existence – On Brigitte Kowanz and working with codes, in: University of Applied Arts, Vienna (publ.): Brigitte Kowanz. more L978T, Vienna, 2006, pp. 30–45. Kowanz uses (semi-)transparent glasses and mirrors, especially in her newer works. This leads to a diverse overlaying of the virtual and the real in her three-dimensional objects. The mutual reflection of light, language and mirror (Rainer Fuchs) produces hybrid spaces whose boundaries seem to be clearly defined at one moment, but gone again the next. Real space and virtual reflection penetrate each other, the boundaries between artwork and observer become fluid. The occupation with the intangible physics of light, which – although a guarantee of visibility – is itself slightly overlooked, persists in the works of Brigitte Kowanz to this day.Rainer Fuchs, Precision without Borders, in: Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien (publ.): Brigitte Kowanz. Now I See. Nuremberg: Verlag für moderne Kunst 2010, S. 40–46.

He was most recently a member of the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Mathews was the quarterback of the Cornell Big Red and finished his time at Cornell ranked among the top 20 quarterbacks in passing yardage in Division I FCS history. He surpassed the Cornell record for total passing yards by more than 2,000 yards and ended his collegiate career as the holder of 47 Cornell and 18 Ivy League conference records. Matthews has also been a member of the Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, Arizona Cardinals and Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

Collegiate career  Mathews did not receive a scholarship to play football for Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, part of the Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-AA), as no Ivy League school gives athletic scholarships. At Cornell, injuries thrust him into the role of starting quarterback at halftime of the first game of his Freshman season. The quarterback job proved to be his for the rest of his collegiate career. Mathews broke the school's single game passing yards record for a Freshman in his first start in the Ivy League opener against Yale University and ended the season with 1,723 yards in the air and 7 touchdown passes, with an additional two touchdowns rushing the football. For his efforts, Mathews was unanimously named the 2010 Ivy League Rookie of the Year. During his 2011 Sophomore campaign, Mathews managed to smash the Cornell single game passing record, racking up 548 yards against Penn. He also set school seasonal records for passing yardage (3,412 yards), touchdown passes (25), and completion percentage (.679). Mathews was ranked third nationally in passing yards per game and passing efficiency and was twice named Ivy League and national player of the week. For his achievements, Mathews was awarded the 2011 Bushnell Cup winner as Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year. Mathews was hampered by injuries during the 2012 Ivy League season, his Junior year. Nevertheless, he managed to lead the league in passing attempts, completions, and yards, managing to accumulate nearly 3,200 yards in the air despite missing a game. Mathews' 355.1 yards passing per game ranked second nationally and he became Cornell's all-time leading passer with 8,331 yards in the air — smashing the previous record of 7,710 yards held by Ricky Rahne. Mathews was named to the All-Ivy second team for his heroics and was runner-up for the 2012 Bushnell Cup as the Ivy League's top offensive player. The 2013 season, Mathews' Senior year, was marked by additional Ivy League honors, including the season's top numbers for attempts, completions, and passing yards (2,953). Mathews's 328.1 yards per game topped the Ivy League and he finished second in passing touchdowns, with 22. He finished 19th in the 2013 Walter Payton Award Voting.http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page;=cfoot2/misc/2013payton_votesXXX.htm Following the season Mathews was named to the College Sports Journal FCS All- America team and received the additional honor of becoming only the fifth player in Cornell school history invited to participate in the East–West Shrine Game, serving as captain of the East squad. Mathews was also invited to participate in the NFL scouting combine in preparation for the 2014 NFL Draft.  Professional career  = NFL = As a prominent player of a marquee position from the Eastern media market who was on the bubble of being drafted into the National Football League, Mathews' draft saga was chronicled in a three part series in the New York Post by sports journalist Brian Costello. Although the career passing leader at Cornell University, Mathews was not regarded as a top professional prospect coming from the NFL scouting combine, with speculation pegging Mathews anywhere from a 5th round draft selection to undrafted.Brian Costello, \\"‘I Don’t Want to Watch': The Pain of Being a Borderline Draft Pick,\\" New York Post, May 6, 2014. While Mathews' strong throwing arm was admired, scouts expressed misgivings about the former Big Red QB's footwork and general lack of athleticism — problematic in the lightning fast professional game.Vaughn McClure, \\"Could Cornell QB make Falcons?\\" ESPN, www.espn.go.com/ Not selected in the May 2014 NFL Draft, Mathews was immediately signed as a free agent by the Atlanta Falcons and attended that team's 2014 training camp.Tom Fleischman, \\"Former Cornell QB Mathews Signs as Free Agent with Atlanta,\\" Elmira Star Gazette, May 20, 2014. This camp was documented by HBO Sports and NFL Films as part of their annual documentary series Hard Knocks, with the team's August 24, 2014 decision to release Mathews featuring prominently in the storyline of the series' penultimate 4th episode.Will Brinson, \\"'Hard Knocks' Episode 4 Review: Falcons Get a Reality Check,\\" CBS Sports, www.cbssports.com/ Aug. 27, 2014. On September 1, 2014, Mathews signed with the Indianapolis Colts, joining their ten-member practice squad, but was subsequently released on September 9, 2014. He signed with the Arizona Cardinals on December 15, 2014. =Hamilton Tiger-Cats= On January 20, 2015, Mathews signed a contract with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Kent Austin, the head coach of the Tiger-Cats, was Mathews' head coach at Cornell University for three seasons from 2010 through 2012. He scored his first touchdown on July 2, 2015, against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. On July 26, 2015, he jumped over the Saskatchewan Roughriders late in the 4th quarter to score the winning touchdown in an eventual 31–21 victory. He capped off a Labour Day Classic drubbing of the Argos by scoring from the one yard line on September 7, 2015. After an injury to starting quarterback Zach Collaros, Mathews became the Tiger-Cats' starter in October 2015. He threw his first CFL touchdown to former Cornell teammate Luke Tasker on October 9, 2015. =Toronto Argonauts= On February 14, 2017, Mathews signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL as a free agent.

Located near the river Cisadane, it is the first Indonesian museum that highlights the history and heritage of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. Benteng Heritage Museum is housed in a traditional, vernacular Peranakan Chinese building. Built in 1684, it is one of the oldest historic structures in Tangerang, and is within walking distance of the city's oldest temple, Boen Tek Bio. Heritage conservation Prior to its conversion into a museum, the original building was very poorly maintained, and was occupied by local Benteng Chinese. Believing that the building had significant historic and cultural value, a local entrepreneur, Udaya Halim, acquired the heritage property in 2009. Halim grew up in Tangerang's historic Pasar Lama area, but moved with his family to Perth, Western Australia during the Asian economic crisis. He oversaw a careful restoration of the building, returning it to its original state. The process took two years. Additional Peranakan Chinese decorative elements, including a partition screen, were added to enhance the Chinese-Indonesian character of the new museum. All the additional decoration was based on a thorough academic study of other structures from a similar period since no data existed regarding the museum's original appearance.

The railway opened in 1905 but closed to passengers in 1935. Freight continued on the line though until 1988, when the line was mothballed as the traffic from the quarries at Caldon Low ceased. In 2009 a new company, Moorlands & City Railways (MCR), was formed with the intention of re-opening the line for commercial freight traffic, and contracted with the local Churnet Valley Railway (CVR) to hold a series of re- opening events in November 2010. Since 2011 an agreement has been reached between the two companies that sees the CVR operate a heritage service along the branch, with MCR continuing negotiations over the return of freight traffic. History The history of the branch is closely linked with the history of the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway (LMVLR) as they were part of same proposal to bring the railways to this rural part of Staffordshire, although the promoters of the scheme and the NSR had different motives. The area east of Leek was (and still is) a rural area consisting of upland hill farms, open moorland interspersed with small villages in the valleys of the rivers Hamps and Manifold. The railways had bypassed such areas as being uneconomic to build into but with the passing of the Light Railways Act 1896 the way was opened for railways to be constructed in rural areas at cheaper cost and with the possibility of financial support from the Treasury. Even as the Light Railways Act was progressing through Parliament a committee was formed in Leek to promote a light railway from Leek to Hartington in Dovedale, Derbyshire. In order to access Treasury funds the line had to be constructed and operated by an existing railway company and as the NSR had a monopoly on rail traffic in the area, the committee entered into discussion with the NSR board in August 1896. The NSR were not only interested in the traffic to be generated from the area but also because it saw the advantage in using a line under the Light Railways Act as a means of building a standard gauge line to the quarries at Caldon Low. The NSR operated the quarry under a 999-year lease and exported limestone from the quarry via a narrow gauge railway from the quarry to the NSR station at and as the quarry expanded this was not the most efficient method of moving the stone. As the main objective of the NSR was to improve its mineral traffic from Caldon Low, the company did not view a link with Leek as a high priority and for a considerable time there was disagreement between the railway company, the promoters of the LMVLR and the people of Leek over whether to build a direct route from Leek to Waterhouses (the Leek curve), as the people of Leek wanted, or solely to build a curve away from Leek towards Stoke, as the railway company wanted. It took two years for the light railway order to be approved and the single line branch was not authorised until 1 March 1899 by the Leek, Caldon Low, and Hartington Light Railways Order 1898. This order did not include the Leek curve at Leek Brook, and it took a further Act of Parliament, the North Staffordshire Railway Act 1899 (62 & 63 Vict. c.ccxxxi) to give the NSR the authority to build the Leek curve. Construction Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire who performed the ceremonial sod-cutting in October 1899 The light railway order authorised the constructionm of four lines: #the line from Leek Brook junction to Caldon (length ) #the line from Caldon into Caldon Low quarry (length ) #the line from Caldon to Waterhouses (length ) #the LMVLR (length ) Very soon after the passing of the order the ceremonial sod-cutting took place and was conducted by the 8th Duke of Devonshire on 3 October 1899 at Waterhouses. Surveying, planning and purchasing the land took two years and tenders for construction were not issued until 1901. There were a number of bidders but eventually all the tenders were granted to when the tenders were let to Hutchinson and Co of Embsay, Yorkshire. Although the tenders called for completion of the branch by 1904 it was a year later before it was completed (the LMVLR had been completed on time in 1904) and it was apparent that there had been some significant under-estimation of the amount of earthworks needed; the original estimate was that the of the Waterhouse and quarry lines would require the excavation of , in fact over was finally excavated. The line was severely graded and also included the highest point on the NSR with a summit between and at . Approval for opening from the Railway Inspectorate was granted in May 1905 and the line opened, initially to Ipstones, on 5 June 1905 and then on to Caldon Low quarry and Waterhouses on 1 July 1905. Passenger services =North Staffordshire Railway= Scheduled passenger services were never intensive. Initially three trains each weekday ran between and Waterhouses with no Sunday service but with additional trains on Saturdays (a market day in Leek). A limited Sunday service was later introduced and by the outbreak of the First World War this pattern had become the norm. As a wartime measure, first class was withdrawn in 1918. After the war the service was downgraded even more, and by the end of the NSR period there were only two trains each way per day with one train each way on Sunday and an extra train each way on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Excursion traffic was intermittent, through excursions direct from Stoke-on-Trent on Thursdays and weekends were a regular feature until the First World War but did not resume afterwards. =London, Midland and Scottish Railway= Under the 1923 Grouping the NSR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). For the Waterhouses line this meant little change in the early days, but soon Sunday trains were discontinued and the extra Wednesday service to serve Leek market day was withdrawn. The LMVLR closed in 1934 and the following year all passenger services over the line were withdrawn. Freight traffic =Milk= The transport of milk and other produce from the farms of the Staffordshire Moorlands district was one of the prime reasons the line had been proposed by the Light Railway Committee. From the opening of the line, the transport of milk was a significant contributor to the finances of the line. Although much of the milk went to local destinations, the bulk of it went further afield and special milk trains ran from the branch to London for several years after the First World War. The closure of the creamery at Ecton in 1932 resulted in a reorganisation by the dairy companies of the collection of milk in the district which led to the milk traffic being diverted away from the LMVLR and the Waterhouses branch which was a major factor in the decision to close the LMVLR in 1934. =Other freight= The carriage of other freight and general merchandise never met the levels the promoters of the line anticipated and one or two trains per day were sufficient to meet the demand. After the withdrawal of the passenger services in 1935, freight traffic continued until 1964 when the goods facilities at Bradnop, Ipstones and Winkhill were withdrawn. =Mineral traffic= The transport of limestone mineral traffic from Caldon Low quarries was the main interest of the NSR in constructing the line as the company were the leaseholders of the quarry. Daily services ran from the earliest days and reached a peak of 4 trains per day in 1927, but the economic depression of the 1930s affected the fortunes of Caldon Low quarry and the traffic had dropped to only one train per day in 1940. After the end of the Second World War there was an increase in traffic and limestone continued to be moved by train from Caldon Low until 1988. Resurgence Churnet Valley Railway train on the branch line near Bradnop on the first weekend of running over the line in 2010 With the end of limestone traffic in 1988 the line went out of use, but was designated as a strategic freight site. In 2009 Moorland and City Railways obtained the line on a 150yr lease from Network Rail with the intention of reopening the line for quarry traffic. With a merger having taken place between Lafarge and Tarmac though, the future ownership of Caldon Low quarry is, , in doubt and the plans for reopening the line for quarry traffic are on hold. The local heritage railway, the Churnet Valley Railway, who already operate the line between and arranged access over the branch line with Moorland and City Railways and since 2011 have operated trains to Caldon Low exchange sidings. In 2014 MCR started the process to upgrade the track, as the current condition of the track will not support modern freight engines and rolling stock, and so the rails have been lifted between Ipstones and Caldon Low quarry with the intention of relaying with new track once the situation over the quarry is known. the Churnet Valley Railway are raising funds to purchase the trackwork between Leek Brook and Ipstones, in order to ensure their operations are not affected by the ongoing uncertainty over the quarry project.

Journal of Bayesian Applications in Marketing, pp. 1–4. Retrieved 26 April 2014, p. 3 The sub- models combine to form the hierarchical model, and Bayes' theorem is used to integrate them with the observed data and account for all the uncertainty that is present. The result of this integration is the posterior distribution, also known as the updated probability estimate, as additional evidence on the prior distribution is acquired. Frequentist statistics may yield conclusions seemingly incompatible with those offered by Bayesian statistics due to the Bayesian treatment of the parameters as random variables and its use of subjective information in establishing assumptions on these parameters. As the approaches answer different questions the formal results aren't technically contradictory but the two approaches disagree over which answer is relevant to particular applications. Bayesians argue that relevant information regarding decision making and updating beliefs cannot be ignored and that hierarchical modeling has the potential to overrule classical methods in applications where respondents give multiple observational data. Moreover, the model has proven to be robust, with the posterior distribution less sensitive to the more flexible hierarchical priors. Hierarchical modeling is used when information is available on several different levels of observational units. The hierarchical form of analysis and organization helps in the understanding of multiparameter problems and also plays an important role in developing computational strategies.  Philosophy  Statistical methods and models commonly involve multiple parameters that can be regarded as related or connected in such a way that the problem implies dependence of the joint probability model for these parameters. Individual degrees of belief, expressed in the form of probabilities, come with uncertainty. Amidst this is the change of the degrees of belief over time. As was stated by Professor José M. Bernardo and Professor Adrian F. Smith, “The actuality of the learning process consists in the evolution of individual and subjective beliefs about the reality.” These subjective probabilities are more directly involved in the mind rather than the physical probabilities. Hence, it is with this need of updating beliefs that Bayesians have formulated an alternative statistical model which takes into account the prior occurrence of a particular event.Bernardo, Smith(1994). Bayesian Theory. Chichester, England: John Wiley & Sons, , p. 23  Bayes' theorem  The assumed occurrence of a real-world event will typically modify preferences between certain options. This is done by modifying the degrees of belief attached, by an individual, to the events defining the options. Suppose in a study of the effectiveness of cardiac treatments, with the patients in hospital j having survival probability \\\\theta_j, the survival probability will be updated with the occurrence of y, the event in which a controversial serum is created which, as believed by some, increases survival in cardiac patients. In order to make updated probability statements about \\\\theta_j, given the occurrence of event y, we must begin with a model providing a joint probability distribution for \\\\theta_j and y. This can be written as a product of the two distributions that are often referred to as the prior distribution P(\\\\theta) and the sampling distribution P(y\\\\mid\\\\theta) respectively: : P(\\\\theta, y) = P(\\\\theta)P(y\\\\mid\\\\theta) Using the basic property of conditional probability, the posterior distribution will yield: : P(\\\\theta\\\\mid y)=\\\\frac{P(\\\\theta,y)}{P(y)} = \\\\frac{P(y\\\\mid\\\\theta)P(\\\\theta)}{P(y)} This equation, showing the relationship between the conditional probability and the individual events, is known as Bayes' theorem. This simple expression encapsulates the technical core of Bayesian inference which aims to incorporate the updated belief, P(\\\\theta\\\\mid y), in appropriate and solvable ways.  Exchangeability  The usual starting point of a statistical analysis is the assumption that the n values y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n are exchangeable. If no information – other than data y – is available to distinguish any of the \\\\theta_j’s from any others, and no ordering or grouping of the parameters can be made, one must assume symmetry among the parameters in their prior distribution.Bernardo, Degroot, Lindley (September 1983). “Proceedings of the Second Valencia International Meeting”. Bayesian Statistics 2. Amsterdam: Elsevier Science Publishers B.V, , pp. 167–168 This symmetry is represented probabilistically by exchangeability. Generally, it is useful and appropriate to model data from an exchangeable distribution as independently and identically distributed, given some unknown parameter vector \\\\theta, with distribution P(\\\\theta). = Finite exchangeability = For a fixed number n, the set y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n is exchangeable if the joint probability P(y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n) is invariant under permutations of the indices. That is, for every permutation \\\\pi or (\\\\pi_1, \\\\pi_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\pi_n) of (1, 2, …, n), P(y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n)= P(y_{\\\\pi_1}, y_{\\\\pi_2}, \\\\ldots, y_{\\\\pi_n}). Following is an exchangeable, but not independent and identical (iid), example: Consider an urn with a red ball and a blue ball inside, with probability \\\\frac{1}{2} of drawing either. Balls are drawn without replacement, i.e. after one ball is drawn from the n balls, there will be n − 1 remaining balls left for the next draw. : \\\\text{Let } Y_i = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\text{if the }i\\\\text{th ball is red}, 0, & \\\\text{otherwise}. \\\\end{cases} Since the probability of selecting a red ball in the first draw and a blue ball in the second draw is equal to the probability of selecting a blue ball on the first draw and a red on the second draw, both of which are equal to 1/2 (i.e. [P(y_1 = 1, y_2 =0) = P(y_1=0,y_2=1)= \\\\frac{1}{2}]), then y_1 and y_2 are exchangeable. But the probability of selecting a red ball on the second draw given that the red ball has already been selected in the first draw is 0, and is not equal to the probability that the red ball is selected in the second draw which is equal to 1/2 (i.e. [P(y_2=1\\\\mid y_1=1)=0 e P(y_2=1)= \\\\frac{1}{2}]). Thus, y_1 and y_2 are not independent. If x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n are independent and identically distributed, then they are exchangeable, but the converse is not necessarily true.Diaconis, Freedman (1980). “Finite exchangeable sequences”. Annals of Probability, pp. 745–747 = Infinite exchangeability = Infinite exchangeability is the property that every finite subset of an infinite sequence y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots is exchangeable. That is, for any n, the sequence y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n is exchangeable.  Hierarchical models  = Components = Bayesian hierarchical modeling makes use of two important concepts in deriving the posterior distribution, namely: # Hyperparameters: parameters of the prior distribution # Hyperpriors: distributions of Hyperparameters Suppose a random variable Y follows a normal distribution with parameter θ as the mean and 1 as the variance, that is Y\\\\mid \\\\theta \\\\sim N(\\\\theta,1). The tilde relation \\\\sim can be read as \\"has the distribution of\\" or \\"is distributed as\\". Suppose also that the parameter \\\\theta has a distribution given by a normal distribution with mean \\\\mu and variance 1, i.e. \\\\theta\\\\mid\\\\mu \\\\sim N(\\\\mu,1). Furthermore, \\\\mu follows another distribution given, for example, by the standard normal distribution, \\\\text{N}(0,1). The parameter \\\\mu is called the hyperparameter, while its distribution given by \\\\text{N}(0,1) is an example of a hyperprior distribution. The notation of the distribution of Y changes as another parameter is added, i.e. Y \\\\mid \\\\theta,\\\\mu \\\\sim N(\\\\theta,1). If there is another stage, say, \\\\mu follows another normal distribution with mean \\\\beta and variance \\\\epsilon, meaning \\\\mu \\\\sim N(\\\\beta,\\\\epsilon), \\\\mbox { }\\\\beta and \\\\epsilon can also be called hyperparameters while their distributions are hyperprior distributions as well. = Framework = Let y_j be an observation and \\\\theta_j a parameter governing the data generating process for y_j. Assume further that the parameters \\\\theta_1, \\\\theta_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\theta_j are generated exchangeably from a common population, with distribution governed by a hyperparameter \\\\phi. The Bayesian hierarchical model contains the following stages: : \\\\text{Stage I: } y_j\\\\mid\\\\theta_j,\\\\phi \\\\sim P(y_j\\\\mid\\\\theta_j,\\\\phi) : \\\\text{Stage II: } \\\\theta_j\\\\mid\\\\phi \\\\sim P(\\\\theta_j\\\\mid\\\\phi) : \\\\text{Stage III: } \\\\phi \\\\sim P(\\\\phi) The likelihood, as seen in stage I is P(y_j\\\\mid\\\\theta_j,\\\\phi), with P(\\\\theta_j,\\\\phi) as its prior distribution. Note that the likelihood depends on \\\\phi only through \\\\theta_j. The prior distribution from stage I can be broken down into: : P(\\\\theta_j,\\\\phi) = P(\\\\theta_j\\\\mid\\\\phi)P(\\\\phi) [from the definition of conditional probability] With \\\\phi as its hyperparameter with hyperprior distribution, P(\\\\phi). Thus, the posterior distribution is proportional to: : P(\\\\phi,\\\\theta_j\\\\mid y) \\\\propto P(y_j \\\\mid\\\\theta_j,\\\\phi) P(\\\\theta_j,\\\\phi) [using Bayes' Theorem] : P(\\\\phi,\\\\theta_j\\\\mid y) \\\\propto P(y_j\\\\mid\\\\theta_j ) P(\\\\theta_j \\\\mid\\\\phi ) P(\\\\phi) Bernardo, Degroot, Lindley (September 1983). “Proceedings of the Second Valencia International Meeting”. Bayesian Statistics 2. Amsterdam: Elsevier Science Publishers B.V, , pp. 371–372 = Example = To further illustrate this, consider the example: A teacher wants to estimate how well a student did on the SAT. The teacher uses information on the student’s high school grades and current grade point average (GPA) to come up with an estimate. The student's current GPA, denoted by Y, has a likelihood given by some probability function with parameter \\\\theta, i.e. Y\\\\mid\\\\theta \\\\sim P(Y\\\\mid\\\\theta). This parameter \\\\theta is the SAT score of the student. The SAT score is viewed as a sample coming from a common population distribution indexed by another parameter \\\\phi, which is the high school grade of the student (freshman, sophomore, junior or senior). That is, \\\\theta\\\\mid\\\\phi \\\\sim P(\\\\theta\\\\mid\\\\phi). Moreover, the hyperparameter \\\\phi follows its own distribution given by P(\\\\phi), a hyperprior. To solve for the SAT score given information on the GPA, : P(\\\\theta,\\\\phi\\\\mid Y) \\\\propto P(Y\\\\mid\\\\theta,\\\\phi)P(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) : P(\\\\theta,\\\\phi\\\\mid Y) \\\\propto P(Y\\\\mid\\\\theta)P(\\\\theta\\\\mid\\\\phi)P(\\\\phi) All information in the problem will be used to solve for the posterior distribution. Instead of solving only using the prior distribution and the likelihood function, the use of hyperpriors gives more information to make more accurate beliefs in the behavior of a parameter.Box G. E.

Goyer, based on the DC Comics character John Constantine. Matt Ryan stars as Constantine, a British exorcist and occult detective who actively hunts supernatural entities. The series aired on NBC from October 24, 2014 to February 13, 2015, over 13 episodes. On May 8, 2015, NBC canceled Constantine after only one season due to ratings not up to network standards. Ryan has said in the past that, were the show on another channel, the ratings would have been comparably high. Ryan would go on to reprise his role in guest appearances in The CW's Arrow and as a series regular in Legends of Tomorrow, retroactively setting the series within the Arrowverse. He also voices the character in the CW Seed animated web series, Constantine: City of Demons; the writer of the series J. M. DeMatteis stated it is a spin-off of the Justice League Dark film, in which Ryan also voiced Constantine. Premise John Constantine, a demon hunter and dabbling master of the occult, must struggle with his past sins while protecting the innocent from the converging supernatural threats that constantly break through to our world due to the \\"Rising Darkness\\". Balancing his actions upon the line of good and evil, Constantine uses his skills and a supernatural scry map to journey across the nation to send these terrors back to their own world, all for the hope of redeeming his soul from eternal torment. Cast and characters =Main= * Matt Ryan as John Constantine: Enigmatic and irreverent, formerly a con man, now a reluctant supernatural detective. * Lucy Griffiths as Liv Aberdine. Griffiths was cast as a series regular for the pilot; however, she was written out of the series when production on further episodes began. * Angélica Celaya as Mary \\"Zed\\" Martin: A psychic artist who finds Constantine intriguing enough to follow him on his exorcisms. * Charles Halford as Francis \\"Chas\\" Chandler: Constantine's oldest friend and staunch companion, who possesses powerful survival skills. * Harold Perrineau as Manny: An authoritative angel assigned to watch over Constantine. =Recurring= * Michael James Shaw as Papa Midnite * Bailey Tippen as Astra Logue * Jeremy Davies as Ritchie Simpson * Emmett J. Scanlan as Jim Corrigan * Jonjo O'Neill as Gary \\"Gaz\\" Lester =Guest= * Elyse DuFour as Nora * Charles Parnell as Nommo * Mark Margolis as Felix Faust * Skyler Day as Miranda * Claire van der Boom as Anne Marie * David A. Gregory as Eddie * Juliana Harkavy as Sarah Episodes On October 30, 2015, Daniel Cerone released a script for the fourteenth episode, titled \\"Final Girl\\", which would have aired if the series had not been canceled. Production =Development= The series was developed by Daniel Cerone and David S. Goyer, with the pilot episode directed by Neil Marshall. The on-screen depiction of Constantine's chain-smoking habit was said to be curtailed because of broadcast television restrictions (the network eventually becomes more lenient and John is shown smoking on screen in later episodes). Additionally, the character's bisexuality was not referenced on screen, with Cerone saying, \\"In those comic books, John Constantine aged in real time. Within this tome of three decades [of comics] there might have been one or two issues where he's seen getting out of bed with a man. So [maybe] 20 years from now? But there are no immediate plans\\". This was met with criticism from the LGBTQ community. Griffiths was cast as the original female lead Liv Aberdine, the daughter of a late friend of John's called Jasper Winters, who comes to discover that she has the ability of seeing the supernatural world among us. She teams up with Constantine to fight the demons who have targeted her and learn more about her late father. Griffiths was dropped after Goyer and Cerone decided to take the series in a different creative direction. The comic character Zed was chosen as a replacement for the female lead. Angélica Celaya was later announced to fill the role. Some of Griffiths' final scenes from the pilot were reshot, explaining why she does not join Constantine in his adventures as originally intended. Both Goyer and Cerone have talked about a possible return for Liv. =Cancellation= In November 2014, NBC announced that they would not be ordering more episodes past the initial order of 13 for the first season, though a second season renewal was not ruled out. When questioned about the chances of the series return in January 2015, NBC president Jennifer Salke said, \\"We wish the show would've done better live. It has a big [delayed] viewership and a younger audience. We love the show and it's safe to say we're still talking about it\\". NBC entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt added, \\"We got on the comic books bandwagon. Maybe, there are too many of them\\". In February 2015, Cerone reconfirmed that the series had not been cancelled and that the producers would pitch their ideas for an additional season to NBC in May 2015. In mid-April 2015, Cerone stated it was \\"a long shot\\" that the series would be renewed, adding \\"While we marginally improved a tough time slot for NBC, we're a very expensive show to produce. A lot of NBC's decision making will not doubt hinge on their new pilots and how they feel those new shows would fare as a companion piece to Grimm, versus a second season of Constantine\\". On April 23, Cerone tweeted that the producers would pitch their ideas for a second season on April 27, which was earlier than he had previously announced in February, with NBC making their decision in early May. Following the meeting, Cerone tweeted that the \\"NBC exec said [to] tell the fans it went well\\" and that \\"If this show comes back for more, I can honestly say it was the fans\\". On May 8, 2015, NBC declined to renew the series for a second season, prompting Warner Bros. Television to shop the series around in an attempt to get it picked up by another network. A month later, Cerone revealed that the cast and crew were released from their contracts after Warner Bros. Television had \\"tried to find a new home for the show... but those efforts didn't pan out\\", and stated \\"that the show is over\\". On the many fans who voiced their support for the series in attempting to get it renewed, Cerone said, \\"we're leaving behind wild and passionate fans who believe in and were moved by what we tried to do. To leave such a significant, dedicated and active fan base on the table—that's the real sadness. You all deserve many years of the series we set out to make, and we're disappointed that we couldn't deliver that to you\\". Release =Broadcast= Constantine aired simultaneously on Global in Canada. In the United Kingdom, the series was acquired by Amazon Video. The series is available to stream in Australia on Stan. It is also available in Canada on Shomi starting September 24, 2015. On July 1, 2016, the series was made available to stream on CW Seed. =Home media= The complete series, along with bonus material, was released on Blu- ray, DVD and digitally on October 4, 2016 by the Warner Archive Collection. Reception =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 72% critic approval rating with an average rating of 6.2/10 based on 46 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"Constantines creepy atmosphere, high-stakes action, and splendid special effects combine with a welcome touch of humor to overcome narrative flaws and present a version of the title character that's close to his comics counterpart\\". Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 53 out of 100 based on 25 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Kylie Peters of Den of Geek, reviewing the pilot episode, said \\"Constantine is worth sticking around for. It may not have achieved greatness yet, but it's not half bad either\\". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the pilot episode \\"Non Est Asylum\\" a 7.5/10, praising Matt Ryan's performance as Constantine saying that the episode is a good set up for the series, but criticized the pacing. Reviewing the entire season, Fowler again praised Ryan's performance, described the season as engaging, and praised the adaptations of arcs from the comics (\\"A Feast of Friends\\", \\"The Saint of Last Resorts\\" and \\"Waiting for the Man\\"), but criticized the episode shifting and team members randomly disappearing. Ultimately, Fowler called the season uneven and awarded it a 7.2/10. Jonathan Bernstein of The Telegraph gave the pilot episode 2 stars out of 5, calling it \\"an endurance test\\". He criticized Lucy Griffiths performance, saying that \\"unless she was being bribed to kill the show stone dead like an old-time boxer paid to take a fall, there's no way she could have been worse in the part\\", but praised Ryan, saying that he \\"brought a certain gravelly charm to the role\\". =Ratings= The premiere episode \\"Non Est Asylum\\" received an additional 2.90 million viewers from DVR viewing, to create a total of 7.14 million viewers for the episode. Spin-offs and related shows =John Con Noir= DC Entertainment released a clay stop motion animation web series called John Con Noir. The web series was developed by Cool Town Creations to support the petition for the television series to be renewed for a second season. The first chapter was released on January 16, 2015 on the DC Comics official website and YouTube account, in addition to the mid-season premiere on NBC. Ryan reprises the role of John Constantine as the character tries to find his own program's creators and showrunners, Goyer and Cerone, after they go missing. If Constantine does not succeed, then the NBC network will have no other choice but to cancel the program. =Arrowverse= In May 2015, Stephen Amell, who portrays Oliver Queen / Green Arrow on The CW's Arrow, revealed he had discussions with DC Entertainment to portray the character on the show, saying, \\"The reason that I was going to guest star on Constantine, at least the idea that we were throwing around was [Constantine's] an expert when it comes to the Lazarus Pit, which is now something that is a part of and will continue to be a part of Arrow\\". Additionally, Arrow showrunner Marc Guggenheim revealed a desire to integrate Constantine into the universe that had been created with Arrow, saying, \\"A lot of the pieces are in place, except for that one final piece, which is what's the fate of Constantine? That's the tricky thing. But it comes up in the writers' room constantly—we have a number of ideas, one idea that's particularly exciting to me. We're in a little bit of a wait-and-see mode\\". In July 2015, additional Arrow showrunner Wendy Mericle added, \\"We really want to [include Constantine]. It's something we've been talking to DC about and it's just a question of some political things, but also the actor's schedule. We're trying to work it out, but we don't know 100 percent if it's going to happen. But we're really optimistic and we would love to have him\\", presumably talking about Matt Ryan. In August 2015, it was confirmed that Ryan would appear on Arrow in the fourth season episode \\"Haunted\\", that involved his character being \\"brought in to deal with the fallout of the resurrection of Sara Lance (Caity Lotz) via Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pit\\". Guggenheim said, \\"This is something the fans were clamoring for\\", praising DC for being so \\"magnanimous and generous in giving us this one-time dispensation\\". John Badham, who directed the fifth episode of Constantine, \\"Danse Vaudou\\", directed the Arrow episode. In addition, Mericle revealed that the version of Constantine that Matt Ryan portrayed on Arrow is the same version of the character that was portrayed on Constantine, therefore retroactively establishing the two shows in a shared universe. On filming the episode, Guggenheim stated it felt like the production team was \\"doing a Constantine/Arrow crossover, and it's so exciting... We're just really glad we got the chance to extend Matt Ryan's run as Constantine by at least one more hour of television. I think you'll see he fits very neatly into our universe. It never feels forced, it feels right\\". It was revealed in October 2017 that Ryan would appear in two episodes of the third season of Legends of Tomorrow, with the appearance taking place chronologically after \\"Haunted\\", revisiting the setting of Arrows fourth season and the events following that season's final episode. After the positive reception of his appearance in Legends of Tomorrow, The CW announced that Ryan would appear in the season again, and later, it was announced ahead of the series' renewal for a fourth season that Ryan's role as Constantine would be upgraded to series regular. =Animated web series= In January 2017, the animated web-series Constantine was announced, for The CW Seed, with Ryan returning to voice the character. CW President Mark Pedowitz noted there had yet to be discussions regarding if any other characters that appeared in the cancelled live-action series to appear in the web series, nor if this version of the character would \\"connect back to the live action storylines he's been a part of\\". Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter and Goyer serve as executive producers and Butch Lukic serves as producer. J.M. DeMatteis wrote the series, which was directed by Dough Murphy. The series premiered on March 24, 2018.

Mmiata is the largest town in Anambra West, and has an estimated population of 98,000. Location It is bordered by Aboegbu and Umueze Anam to the south, Ezichi River to the east across which lies such towns such as Iyiora and Umuoba III, Inoma-Akator and Nzam in the western flank. Origin and History Despite the fact that there was no written record about the past up till the end of the 19th century, some elders still remembered a lot of things about themselves and their surroundings as was handed down to them from their ancestors, and have advantage of being able to store those facts in their memories and passing them down from generation to generation. According to the already mentioned tradition, Mmiata Anam was founded in the 18th century by some group of hunters from Aguleri, Nando and Anaku, all in Igboland and in the now Omambala region of Anambra State. These hunters met several times in the hunting ground and especially at \\"Ọda\\", where they rested after their hunting expeditions. As a result of that, they became familiar with one another and having seen that there were many resources in the land including economic trees, many species of animals and fishes, fertile areas to cultivate and the place as a safe one to stay away from some troubles at home. Therefore, they settled there and not only brought some of their immediate family members but urged others including their friends to join them. They called the settlement \\"Ụmụanata\\" or \\"Mmụanata\\", in Anam dialect (the coming together of siblings). The name was later changed to Mmiata, which suggests one unity, one people. Because of the increase in their population, Mmiata encroached towards Umueze's former location (Aboh) as well as pushed towards Nzam in Olu in search of more agricultural lands and fish ponds. That push caused the war between Mmiata and Nzam which Olu people urged their sons and daughters to go to war, with their usual saying that, \\"if a fish is seized from one Olu person it will mean that it has been seized from the whole Olu\\". The battle between the two towns of Mmiata and Nzam turned out to be a war between the Leopard and Nzam (Ọgwụ agụ na Nzam) in which a leopard believed to be a metamorphose of a man from Mmiata was said to have killed many Nzam people in aid of his own people. Mmiata therefore regarded the leopard as totem, and there are taboos against killing or eating its meat. It is necessary to note that a family in Umudeze broke away from the rest of Mmiata in 1952 due to some differences between them and the rest of Mmiata and cross to \\"Ọvịanwagbo\\" in Aguleri. They settled there and created Mmiata II (Umudeze Aguleri). Administrative Structure The administrative system in Mmiata Anam as in other parts of Igboland, did not centralise on one political authority. Therefore, the administration are shared by groups, institutions and organizations. The largest authority was the village group where each member village was very much represented in matters that affected them. Nevertheless, the executive, legislative and judicial affairs of Mmiata Anam people usually began with the village level of government and ended with that of the village group assembly which comprised the two villages of Mmiata (Umuonuorah and Umudeze). Owing to this, governmental activities at these two levels were very much similar. It was so because, they followed the same pattern of representation and participation. Every male adult of all lineages starting from 23 years of age (Ebe nche belụ) to the oldest men (Otummuo) freely participated. Notwithstanding, Mmiata administrative authority was also widely dispersed among other institutions such as the age grades and the titled societies. Such institutions and organizations included the Ọwanụnọ, Okpokolo, and the Otummụọ, all of these groups formed the council of elders. His Royal Highness, Igwe Sylvester Nnose (Eze Di Ebube 1 of Anam) is the current traditional ruler of Mmiata. The stool of the Eze Mmiata was founded in the 19th century when the first traditional ruler was installed. Economy The main occupation of Mmiata people is trading, fishing, and farming; they depend mainly on agriculture and commerce for their daily livelihood. The location of the town within the tropical rainforest gives it the ecological basis for production of a wide range of tropical agricultural crops with widespread potential for industrial conventions. Most Mmiatans have out-station gardens where they usually cultivate their farm products. The prime cash crops include groundnut, maize, melon, etc. Food crops such as yam, cassava, potato and cocoyam are also produced in large quantities.

Its formal name was the 'Contract for Use with Complex Projects, First Edition 2013'. In November 2015, the Complex Projects Contract was updated by the Chartered Institute of Building in response to feedback from the industry. Despite effectively being a second edition, it was renamed the Time and Cost Management Contract 2015 (abbreviated to TCM15) to reflect the core strengths of the contract.  Launch  Based upon extensive research carried out by the CIOB,\\"Managing the Risk of Delayed Completion in the 21st Century\\" http://www.ciob.org/time-management the contract was formally launched on 23 April 2013. The contract was billed as the world's first contract specifically aimed at the management of time in complex construction and engineering projects.\\"The CIOB Complex Projects Contract 2013, by Keith Pickavance \\" http://www.thenbs.com/pdfs/NBS-NationlC&LReport2013-single.pdf; at p.22. The authors also stated that it was the first form to follow the Society of Construction Law Delay and Disruption Protocol,\\"The Society of Construction Law Delay and Disruption Protocol, 2002\\" and that it was also the first standard form contract to cater for Building Information Modelling (BIM) and the future of collaborative design. Purpose It is suited for works of high value or complexity, major real estate projects and engineering or infrastructure projects. It is not suited to simpler works, those of short duration or with inexperienced clients /contractors. It anticipates Special Conditions for the particular requirements of each project and if using construction management as the procurement method, it cannot be used without the appropriate terms being included in the Special Conditions. CPC2013 is designed for use by companies and public authorities in the UK and in any other country where works comprise complex building and / or engineering, which cannot reasonably be expected to be managed intuitively. It can be used where the contractor is expected to construct only that designed by or under the direction of the client with traditional drawings, specification and/or bills of quantities, or BIM, or on projects which require a contractor's design in part, or for design-build projects in which the contractor designs the whole of the works with or without an employer's reference design. The contract requires a collaborative approach to the management of design, quality, time and cost. The working schedule, planning method statement and progress records (which are to be inspected and accepted by a competent project time manager and independently audited for quality assurance) are at the core of management. They are the tools by which all time and time-related cost issues are to be determined and are to conform with the standards required by the conditions, appendices and the CIOB's Guide to Good Practice in the Management of Time in Complex Projects.\\"The Guide to Good Practice in the Management of Time in Complex Projects\\", Chartered Institute of Building, Wiley Blackwell 2010, Collaboration In order to promote collaboration and to ensure transparency of data, schedule and database submittals are to be made in native file format either by maintenance of the material in a common data environment or transfer by a file transfer protocol to all having a continuing design, administrative, or supervisory role, who are identified as Listed Persons. The contract also requires the appointment of a Contract Administrator to carry out administrative functions during the course of construction, a Project Time Manager to advise on time related matters, a Valuer to advise on cost matters, a Design Coordination Manager to manage the integration of the Contractor's design, and a Data Security Manager to supervise and maintain the integrity and security of digital communications. Risk management Central to the philosophy of the Complex Projects Contract is its approach to transparency in risk management. CPC2013 provides for both the owner and contractor each to identify one or more time contingency allowance, which each can use as it wishes to manage its own risks. Unusually for a standard form construction contract, it defines \\"float\\" and provides that if either party creates free float or total float as a result of its own improvement of progress, that party may keep the created float as its own contingency. Additional powers are provided in CPC2013 to enable the construction project's developer, following consultation, to instruct acceleration, recovery and changes in resources sequences and logic in order to manage its risks contemporaneously. Time management CPC2013 is distinctive in taking a prescriptive approach to the management of time and associated cost risk and combining critical path network techniques with resource-based planning. The time model, referred to as the Working Schedule, combines a high-density, short-term look-ahead similar in concept to that used in agile software development with medium and long-term lower density schedule along the lines of that used in the waterfall model planning technique, the whole being revised regularly on the Rolling Wave planning principle. In the short-term look-ahead, the logic is to be resource and location-related, instead of activity based, as it is in waterfall. The agile part of the schedule is to have its activity durations calculated by reference to the resources to be applied and their expected productivity. Cost management The activities in the Working Schedule are also to be valued so that the Working Schedule also functions as the pricing schedule to predict current value for the purposes of interim payment and the ultimate out-turn cost for cost risk management purposes. Progress records Progress is required to be recorded in a database identifying, at specified intervals, the resources used, productivity achieved and earned value. Apart from being the source data for subsequent progress update of the schedule, the database also serves for benchmarking productivity achievable for quality assurance of the schedule and future planning. Dispute resolution The emphasis of CPC2013 is on contemporaneous Issue Resolution by an appropriate expert. CPC2013 it also provides for an escalating Dispute Resolution procedure, embracing negotiation, mediation, adjudication and arbitration. Where issues are required to be determined by Issue Resolution within a certain timescale, if the procedure is not invoked there are deeming provisions which determine the outcome of an issue. If Dispute Resolution is required, the expert, adjudicator or arbitrator are either those named in the contract or, in default, they are appointed by the Academy of Experts in Londonhttp://www.academyofexperts.org/ or the CIOB. The default adjudication rules are those of the Scheme for Construction Contractshttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2333/contents/made and the default arbitration procedure is that of the London Court of International Arbitration. Ancillary publications A back-to-back Consultancy Appointment and Subcontract, both of which followed the same principles of time and cost risk management, were published in November 2015 as part of the Time and Cost Management Contract 2015 suite.  Industry reception  A number of reviews and commentaries have been written on the subject of the Complex Projects Contract. Some have criticized the complexity of the contract itself .\\"Complex Projects Contract 2013 - A complex solution for a complex problem\\" http://www.nabarro.com/Downloads/Construction-newsletter-October-2013.pdf \\"Speechly Bircham: The New CIOB Complex Projects Contract: What you need to know\\" http://www.speechlys.com/knowledge-centre/knowledge- centre/publications/real-estate-and-contruction-and-engineering/the-new-ciob- complex-projects-contract-what-you-need-to-know.aspx whereas others have noted the benefits of the clear language, and have commented on the incorporation of its positive features.\\"Navigant Consulting, Inc., Construction Forum Issue 8,The New CIOB Contract For Use On Complex Projects, by Jeremy Glover,\\" http://www.navigant.com/~/media/WWW/Site/Insights/Construction/IFH%20Winter%202013/CON_IH_NewCIOBContractForUseOnComplexProjects_TL_1213%20final.ashx ,Fenwick Elliott LLP, Insight Issue No.33 “The Complex Project Projects Contract 2013” http://www.fenwickelliott.com/files/insight_issue_33.pdfPractical Law Construction Blog “CIOB’s Contract for use with Complex Projects: take the plunge!” http://construction.practicallaw.com/blog/construction/plc/?p=1612\\"FTI Consulting: James Myers Discusses the New CIOB Complex Projects Contract\\" Reviews published have consistently commented that it will be necessary for the contract to be tested on a live project before the effectiveness can be proven.

Biography Cestero was born in San Cristobal, Dominican Republic, the son of Mariano Antonio Cestero Aybar and Mercedes Leiva and Puello. He did his first studies at the Colegio San Luis Gonzaga in Santo Domingo, a city where his parents took him to reside during his childhood. During his adolescence he was invlonced in national politics. He was a secretary of the president Horacio Vázquez and associate of President Carlos Morales Languasco, both of whom he accompanied on several of their armed campaigns. During the time period between 1928 and 1938, he represented the country at political conventions, signing international treaties on human rights conferences held in the United States, South America and the Caribbean. He was Minister of Finance of the Dominican Republic in 1933.https://www.hacienda.gob.do/sobre-nosotros/historia/ He also wrote for Dominican newspapers El Teléfono, Listín Diario, La Campaña and El Hogar and for the magazine Letras y Ciencias. Literary Career Remembered as one of Dominican Republic’s great modernists, his first venture into literature was as an essayist, with work Notas y escorzos (1898), which chronicles the life and work of the most notable members of the modernist literary movement. He also published the poems: Del amor (1901), El jardín de los sueños (1904) y Sangre de primavera (1908) and the play Cythera (1907). However, it is in creative prose where he manages to express his true qualities as a writer, especially in his book Ciudad romántica (1911) and the novel La Sangre (1913). Much of his work is characterized by the severity with which he depicted political and social problems in the Dominican Republic, where he openly denounced many of the crimes committed during the dictatorship of Ulises Heureaux. He died in Santiago, Chile on October 27, 1955.

July 1894 – 18. December 1976, Helsinki, Finland) was a Finnish physiologist and philosopher and professor of physiology in University of Helsinki. He developed general sensory physiology on the bases of Kantian epistemology, psycho-physics and phenomenology.  Life  Yrjö Reenpää’s father Alvar Renqvist was owner and director of a publishing house, professor, and parliamentarian. Having graduated from the high school in 1912 Yrjö Reenpää started to study medicine in University of Helsinki. Very early he was involved in research work focused on physiology under the supervision of Robert Tigerstedt, the first professor of physiology in University of Helsinki. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the physiology of taste with the title Über den Geschmack in 1918. After having served in the medical staff of the Finnish Armed Forces during the war, he returned to the Department of Physiology in University of Helsinki to continue research in sensory physiology. In line with other scientists in the first half of the 20th century, he paid several visits to physiology departments in German universities establishing lifelong contacts to sensory physiologists like Max von Frey, Johannes von Kries and [Viktor von Weizsäcker] among others. After [Robert Tigerstedt]’s successor his son Carl Tigerstedt’s death in 1927 Reenpää was nominated to the chair of physiology, the position he held until his retirement in 1962.  General sensory physiology  Having started with experimental research on sensory physiology in the fields of taste, tactile sense, muscular sense and the sense of movement, he proceeded to deal with the principal topic of general sensory physiology that of psycho-physics. Mapping the relations of measured sensation magnitudes to stimulus parameters revealed to him the structure of the phenomenal perceptual manifold and its metrics. He outlined in an axiomatic form the psycho-physical relation fitting with Kantian epistemology and with phenomenology as presented in the first half of the century by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger among others. Applying psycho-physical methods he and his collaborators, R. M. Bergström, later his successor, Alvar Wilska, and Eeva Jalavisto among others, obtained experimental evidence of the structures of perceptual manifolds in various sensory modalities. After his retirement he extended the philosophical considerations to include the psycho-physiological issues of mind-matter relation and discussed psycho-physiological parallelism in cases relating perceptions to evoked response data particularly in audition in the studies by Wolf Dieter Keidel and his collaborators in the University of Erlangen, where Reenpää had a visiting professorship.  Philosophy  On the bases of the studies in sensory and observational physiology Reenpää conceived that sensory perceptions constitute the fundamental knowledge base also to the natural sciences. According to him, concepts can be traced back to phenomenal observations in line with the [Kantian tables of judgment and categories]. Concepts arise from the noumenal contents of observations by extracting them out of their temporal frame of the act of perception, as purely timeless entities. The [psycho-physical] relation can according to Reenpää be regarded as an issue of simultaneous isomorphism based on conceptual correspondence rather than possessing a causal relation.  Cultural activity  In addition to his scientific activities Yrjö Reenpää was among others the president of the Finnish Medical Society (Duodecim) in 1933-1936, president of the Nordic Society of Physiology in 1936-1939, chairman of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters (1942-1943). He was also nominated as the member of Heidelberg Academy for Sciences and Humanities (1939). He was one of the founding members of the Finnish Cultural Foundation and had a position as its first chairman (1937-1953). The Foundation nominated the annual series of lectures for invited outstanding foreign scientists, as Yrjö Reenpää Memorial Lecture since 1979.
