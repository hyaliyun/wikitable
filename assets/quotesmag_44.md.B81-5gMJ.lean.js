West was elected to the Royal Society in 2006; his citation read West has constructed supergravity theories in ten dimensions. These theories combine supersymmetry with general relativity, and they encode many of the properties of strings and branes. West created a research group working on supersymmetry and strings in the Mathematics Department at King's College London. Early life and education Peter West completed his secondary school education at Liverpool College after which he obtained his BSc in physics at Imperial College, London in 1973 where he subsequently studied for his Ph.D under the supervision of Abdus Salam until 1976. After postdoctoral positions at the École normale supérieure in Paris and then Imperial College London, he moved to King's College London in 1978. He has held short term positions at Stony Brook at The State University of New York, the California Institute of Technology, CERN, the Chalmers Institute of Technology in Goteborg and the Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics in Vienna. Works Peter West is one of the pioneers of supersymmetry and its application to string theory. He discovered many of the quantum properties of supersymmetric theories in four dimensions including an early version of the supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorems and the superconformal invariance of large classes of supersymmetric quantum field theories, including the maximally supersymmetric N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, which has 16 supersymmetries, theories with 8 supersymmetries and 4 supersymmetries. The non-renormalization theorem plays a key role in determining how supersymmetry might be realised in nature and the above were the first discovered non- trivial conformal quantum field theories in four dimensions. West constructed the two maximal supergravity theories that exist in ten dimensions; the IIA theory and, with Paul Howe and John Henry Schwarz, the IIB theory. These theories are the low energy effective actions, including non-perturbative effects, of the corresponding string theories and as a result they are one of the cornerstones in our understanding of string theory. Kellogg Stelle and West, and at the same time Sergio Ferrara and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, found the supergravity theory in four dimensions which possesses an algebra with four supersymmetries which existed without the use of the equations of motion that is, they found the auxiliary fields that extended the first discovered supergravity theory. Using this off-shell formulation West and Stelle, together with the complementary work of Ferrara and van Nieuwenhuizen, introduced a tensor calculus for supergravity and this led to the construction of the most general supersymmetric theory in four dimensions, which has played a crucial role in the construction of realistic supersymmetric models. West, together with Ali Chamseddine, formulated both ordinary gravity and supergravity as a Yang–Mills theory and so provided the first algebraic proof of the supersymmetric invariance of supergravity theories. The gauging approach of Chamseddine and West was different to the earlier ideas of gauging to find gravity that took the Poincaré transformations on Minkowski spacetime and made them local, that is, they took the translations to depend on spacetime. The gauging method of Chamseddine and West has been used to construct conformal supergravity theories and plays a key role in the formulation of higher spin theories. André Neveu and West pioneered the development of gauge covariant string theory; including the free term and the general features of the interacting theory. A complete formulation of gauge covariant open string theory was found by Edward Witten. More recently West has proposed that M-theory, the underlying theory of strings and branes, should have a very large Kac–Moody algebra, called E11, as a symmetry. He has shown that this theory contains all the maximal supergravity theories.  Books  * Introduction to Supersymmetry and Supergravity, P.

Bergman was born in Blažuj near Sarajevo. She was the eldest of four daughters of the railway officer Joseph Bergmann, an Ashkenazi Jew who moved from Vienna during the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite the family's modest income, Bergman's mother was determined to secure higher education for her daughters. In order to qualify, the girls first had to attend gymnasium; Berta and her sister Marija thus became, in 1905, the first female pupils in Mostar's Velika gimnazija. In February 1912, the Croatian newspaper Narodna obrana reported that Bosnia and Herzegovina got its first female high school graduate, Berta Bergmann. She went on to study medicine in Vienna, graduating in 1918. All her younger sisters received university degrees as well, Marija being the first Bosnian woman awarded a doctorate. Bergman's career as pediatrician took her to a number of places in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, including Banja Luka. After quitting her position in Banja Luka, Bergman was awarded money for self-sacrifice and risking her own life. She then worked in Mostar as head of the local children's polyclinic. After the invasion of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany in April 1941 and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia, a fascist puppet state, on the territory which included Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bergman lost her job. Her sister Marija and Marija's family were deported to the Rab concentration camp, while 49-year-old Doctor Bergman joined the Partisan guerrilla resistance movement. She provided the Partisan fighters with medical care, supplies and first aid lessons. She was imprisoned twice; the capture on 15 January 1945 led to her deportation to Jasenovac concentration camp, where she was killed by the Ustaše.

It was formed after the Battle of Stalingrad from the 321st Rifle Division in recognition of that division's actions during the battle, specifically the encirclement and the siege of the German forces in the city, and later for its pursuit of the defeated Axis forces in Operation Little Saturn. The 82nd Guards continued a record of distinguished service through the rest of the Great Patriotic War, concluding in the Battle of Berlin, and continued to serve postwar in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany.  Formation  The 82nd Guards was one of several Guards rifle divisions created in the aftermath of the fighting for Stalingrad, on March 19, 1943. It was formed from a cadre of the 321st Rifle Division, in recognition of that division's steadfast qualities in the encirclement and siege of the German Sixth Army in the Battle of Stalingrad, and in particular its pursuit of the defeated Axis forces from the Caucasus region. When formed, its primary order of battle was as follows: * 242nd Guards Rifle Regiment from 484th Rifle Regiment * 244th Guards Rifle Regiment from 488th Rifle Regiment * 246th Guards Rifle Regiment from 493rd Rifle Regiment * Unknown Guards Artillery Regiment from 986th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IV, 1995, p 78. Sharp does not include a numerical designation for the Guards Artillery Regiment. The division formed up in 62nd Army as that army was being reformed as the 8th Guards Army in the spring of 1943. The 82nd was one of the first units assigned to the new 29th Guards Rifle Corps, and, remarkably, remained under these two commands for the duration of the war and into the postwar era. 8th Guards Army was originally assigned to Southwestern Front (after October 20, 3rd Ukrainian Front). The division continued under the command of Mjr. Gen. I.A. Makarenko, a position he would hold until April 1, 1944.  In Southwestern Front  During the Battle of the Dnieper, 8th Guards Army closed on the city of Zaporozhye, famous before the war for its hydro-electric dams. The Front's first attack on October 10 made few gains, but a following night attack on the 13th, supported by a massive artillery bombardment, forced the Germans to abandon the city the next day. In recognition of its role in this success, the men and women of the 82nd Guards were awarded the city's name as an honorific.  In 3rd Ukrainian Front  As the Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive continued, in early April 1944, 8th Guards Army was advancing through difficult conditions towards the city of Odessa. On April 10, that city was liberated by a three-pronged attack by 8th Guards, 6th and 5th Shock Armies. Following this, 8th Guards advanced to the estuary of the Dniestr River by the 13th. This was a dead end, and in early May, during the First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive, the army was ordered up the east bank of the river to relieve 5th Guards Army in the bridgehead it held at Tashlyk. This relief occurred over the nights of May 5, 6 and 7. The 82nd Guards did not enter the bridgehead immediately, but remained with its corps holding the east bank between Tashlyk and Grigoriopol. All this activity was not missed by the Germans, and very early on May 10 their XXXX Panzer Corps launched a powerful attack to drive in the bridgehead. Over the next three days this assault drove the bridgehead back until it was about 11km wide but only 1 - 3km deep. On the morning of May 14 the division entered the bridgehead and relieved the 39th Guards Rifle Division, helping to stabilize the situation. Due to this setback, among others, the Soviet offensive was halted, and would not resume until August.David M.

This was in response to the expansion of slavery into the new territories. It was one of the movements which arose from the political chaos in the decade before the American Civil War in the wake of the Compromise of 1850. The movement arose before and was quickly subsumed by the coalescence of the Republican Party in 1856. During the fragmenting of the Second Party System of Jackson Democrats and Clay Whigs, the Democratic efforts to expand slavery into western territories, particularly Kansas, led to organized political opposition, which coalesced in Congress as the \\"Opposition Party.\\" As the Whig Party disintegrated, many local and regional parties grew up, some ideological, some geographic. When they realized their numbers in Congress, they began to caucus in the same way US political parties had arisen before the Jacksonian national party conventions. Scholars such as Kenneth C.

The administration of Democratic President Franklin Pierce had been marred by Bleeding Kansas. Northerners began to coalesce around resistance to Kansas entering the Union as a slave state. The ongoing violence made any election results from that territory suspect by standards of democracy. The Opposition Party was the name adopted by several former Whig politicians in the period 1854–1858. In 1860, the party was encouraged by the remaining Whig leadership to effectively merge with the Constitutional Union Party. It represented a brief but significant transitional period in American politics from approximately 1854 to 1858. Since independence, a major political issue had been conflict, whether open or structural, between the pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in the United States, fought more on the basis of regional and class affiliations than strictly along party lines. Passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854 both did major short-term political damage to Northern Democrats and fractured the Whig Party on the slavery issue, driving the formation of the anti-slavery Republican Party. During that transitional period, the Opposition Party served as a successor to, or a continuation of, the imploding Whig Party. The party was seen as offering a compromise position between the Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans. The Whig name had been critically weakened, but former Whigs still needed to advertise that they were opposed to the Democrats. The Know Nothings had found that their appeals to anti-immigrant prejudice were faltering and their secrecy was made suspect, so they sought more open and more inclusive appeals to broaden a candidate's chances at the polls.Martis, Kenneth C., et al., The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress, 1789–1989, Macmillan Publishing Company, NY, 1989, pp. 32–34, . The \\"confounding party labels among all those who opposed the Democrats\\" have led to scholars of U.S. political parties in Congress to adopt the convention \\"Opposition Party\\" for the 34th and 35th Congresses. This term encompasses Independent, Know Nothing, Fusion, Anti-Nebraska, Anti- Administration, Whig, Free Soil and Unionist.Martis, Kenneth C., et al., The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress, 1789–1989, Macmillan Publishing Company, NY, 1989, pp. 385–392, . Following the 1854 election, the Opposition Party actually was the largest party in the U.S. House of Representatives. In the resulting 34th United States Congress, the U.S. House's 234 Representatives were made up of 100 Oppositionists, 83 Democrats, and 51 Americans (Know Nothing).Martis, Kenneth C., et al., The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress, 1789–1989, Macmillan Publishing Company, NY, 1989, pp. 108–109, . That was a very dramatic shift from the makeup of the 33rd United States Congress (157 Democrats, 71 Whigs, 4 Free Soilers, 1 Independent, 1 Independent Democrat). As a provisional coalition more united by what it opposed and not yet fully having agreed on what it stood for, being the largest party did not lead to control of Congress. The new Speaker of the House, elected by plurality, was Nathaniel Prentice Banks of Massachusetts, a former Democrat who campaigned as a Know Nothing in 1854 and as a Republican in 1856. By the 1856 elections, the Republican Party had formally organized, while the Democrats enjoyed a fleeting political recovery from damage done by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. The 35th United States Congress comprised 132 Democrats, 90 Republicans, 14 Americans, 1 Independent Democrat.Martis, Kenneth C., et al., The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress, 1789–1989, Macmillan Publishing Company, NY, 1989, pp. 110–111, .

Established as a modern settlement in 1876 and incorporated as a city in 1928, the land had previously been lived on by native peoples of the southwest, primarily the Sinagua. Mountaineer Antoine Leroux then traveled the area, with Edward Fitzgerald Beale following in his footsteps and establishing a trail through the city in the mid-1800s. With a local spring, a small settlement grew by the wagon road, and the town was dominated by the McMillan, Riordan, and Babbitt families. Focused on agricultural pursuits, these families constructed some historic red stone buildings that still stand today. Beale's trail was replaced with cross-country railroads and highways, including Route 66. This expanded tourism – a main draw of the city is its location surrounded by sites of natural wonder, including the Grand Canyon – and was cause for an economic boost even through the Great Depression, before overpopulation and poor infrastructure led to the city's decline. A heritage project revitalized the city in the 1990s, leading to it developing a downtown culture. Through its history, Flagstaff has also been an astronomy hot-spot, given its altitude of around and pollution-free skies. Early settlements The Sinagua people were a pre-Columbian culture that occupied a large area in Arizona from the Little Colorado River, near Flagstaff, to the Verde River near Sedona, including the Verde Valley, area around the San Francisco Peaks, and significant portions of the Mogollon Rim country, between approximately 500 CE and 1425 CE. Christian E. Downum wrote that the Northern Sinagua began living in the pine forests of northern Arizona in the 5th century before moving into the area that is now Flagstaff in about 700 CE. Though a largely hunter-gatherer culture, Sinagua farmers cultivated maize beginning in the 8th century. They learned irrigation techniques from their southern Hohokam neighbors and added beans and squash to their crops. The 1064 and 1066 eruptions of Sunset Crater covered the area in ash, which greatly enriched the soil for farming. Guy Gibbon mapped the cultural phases of the Northern Sinagua, placing them around Sunset Crater between 700 CE and 900 CE (leaving the Wupatki National Monument ruins); the Rio de Flag from 900 to 1066 (leaving the Picture Canyon site); Angell and Winona between 1066 and 1100; Padre Canyon from 1100 to 1150; Elden Pueblo between 1150 and 1250; Turkey Hill Pueblo from 1250 to 1300; and Clear Creek between 1300 and 1400. They are also believed to have worked the land around Walnut Canyon from around 600 CE until the mid-13th century, farming at the rim before moving into cliff dwellings in the canyon in the 12th century. The Sunset Crater eruption and subsequent agricultural benefits also caused a population growth in the area, with Ancestral Puebloans and Cohonina people also moving to the Wupatki site. Sinagua peoples left the area by the early 15th century. Like other pre- Columbian cultures in the southwest, the Sinagua apparently abandoned their permanent settlements around this time, though the precise reasons for such a large-scale abandonment are not yet known; resource depletion, drought, and clashes with the newly arrived Yavapai people have been suggested. The Sinagua likely moved north to Homolovi and beyond, becoming the Hopi. The San Francisco Peaks (which mark the city of Flagstaff's northern border) are a sacred site in Hopi culture, and the culture of many other southwestern Native groups. Archeological and linguistic evidence suggests that the Yavapai people began developing independently from the Patayan at some point around 1300 CE. Until western expansion in the 1860s, the Yavapai, specifically the Wi:pukba (Northeastern Yavapai), occupied the land up to the San Francisco Peaks. Wi:pukba groups had tumultuous relations with the nearby Havasupai and Hualapai people from around 1750. Though the Pai peoples all spoke Upland Yuman dialects, and had a common cultural history, each peoples had tales of a dispute that separated them from each other; according to myth, the dispute began with a \\"mudball fight between children\\". The Yavapai land in the area saw overlap with the land of the Northern Tonto Apache that stretched across the San Francisco Peaks to the Little Colorado River. Of the Northern Tonto Apache, two tribes lived within the area of present-day Flagstaff: the Oak Creek band and the Mormon Lake band. Only the Mormon Lake band consisted entirely of Apache Indians, as the other three Northern Tonto bands mixed with the Yavapai; the Mormon Lake band also faced off against the Navajo to the north and east of their land. The Oak Creek band was largely centered near Sedona, but lived as far north as Flagstaff, with the Mormon Lake band centered around Flagstaff. They were exclusively hunter-gatherers, and traveled around places like the foot of the San Francisco Peaks, at Mount Elden, Lake Mary, Stoneman Lake, and Padre Canyon. A US Army Corps of Engineers book notes that Flagstaff did not have a colonial Spanish presence. There were Spanish missionaries about away in 1629, originating the San Francisco name in Arizona, with later 17th century Spanish Franciscans giving the San Francisco Peaks their name. Establishment alt=Large rustic white house between trees The area of Flagstaff had a wagon road to California in the 1800s, constructed by Edward Fitzgerald Beale's men, with a spring (Antelope/Old Town Spring) nearby. There was also a supplies station situated 7 miles northwest of the present city, near Leroux Springs, from 1856 to about 1876. The Leroux Springs are named for Antoine Leroux, the guide of the Sitgreaves Expedition who led them to the spring in 1851. It has been suggested that Flagstaff owes its existence to Leroux and this expedition; Beale was an admirer of Leroux and made sure his paths traveled by the springs, and in turn it was from Beale's wagon road that the city developed. The first white (non-Native) settlement in the area was established by Edward Whipple, who opened a saloon on the wagon road in 1871. At the time, the area was known as Antelope Spring. The first permanent settlement came in 1876, when Thomas F. McMillan built a cabin just north of the present-day main town. McMillan had been born in Tennessee, but prospected gold in California and reared sheep in Australia; in northern Arizona he started a successful sheep farm. McMillan was a key developer of northern Arizona. alt=Flagpole in a field The city was founded on July 4, 1876, with a flag-raising. A ponderosa pine flagpole made by a scouting party from Boston (known as the \\"Second Boston Party\\") was raised to celebrate the United States Centennial. This flag-raising also gave the city its name, though other stories have been told of flagstaffs that supposedly named the city: one story says that on July 4, 1855, a surveyor for the railroad and his team climbed a tall pine tree and tied a flag, with another saying it was Beale's men who raised the flag in 1859. The town was known by different names when the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad was being built through the area in 1882. It may have been known as Flagstaff Spring for a while, and 'Old Town Spring' after this before simply 'Old Town'. The name 'Old Town' was given to the original settlement either before or after a fire destroyed it. For the former, the story goes that the railroad depot was moved by half a mile to avoid hill starts, and business owners soon followed it, displacing the commerce of the town to Front Street of 'New Town' while the houses were still in 'Old Town' with the spring; when the fire burned down 'Old Town', 'New Town' remained. For the latter, the story says that after the fire destroyed much of the town, a new community was then raised a few hundred yards away and called 'New Town', deeming the burnt- out area the 'Old Town'. Local Moenkopi red sandstone had been used as the foundation for many of the buildings in town, and is fire-resistant; it soon became the choice building material for complete structures. The name Flagstaff was reinstated in 1884 when a post office was introduced alongside the railroad depot. Development alt=Stone building During the 1880s, Flagstaff began to grow, with the early economy based on timber, sheep, and cattle. By 1886, Flagstaff was the largest city on the railroad line between Albuquerque and the west coast of the United States.\\"Flagstaff Community Profile.\\" Official City Website. Retrieved on April 11, 2007. In this year, it had a population of 600 and \\"more saloons than all other businesses combined\\". In 1888, McMillan purchased an unfinished building that sits at the present- day intersection of Leroux Street and Route 66/Santa Fe Avenue, turning it into a bank and hotel known as the Bank Hotel. Coconino County was created in 1891, and Flagstaff was chosen as its county seat over nearby Williams; McMillan became chairman of the Board of Supervisors for the new county. The next year, stagecoach tours to the Grand Canyon began running from the Bank Hotel, which also housed an opera house that doubled as an events hall for entertainment. In 1894, Massachusetts astronomer Percival Lowell hired A. E. Douglass to scout an ideal site for a new observatory. Douglass, impressed by Flagstaff's elevation, suggested it to Lowell, saying: \\"other things being equal, the higher we can get the better\\".P. Lowell to A. E. Douglass, April 16, 1894, Lowell Observatory Archives. The Lowell Observatory was constructed on Mars Hill, overlooking the town. Two years later, the specially designed Clark Telescope that Lowell had ordered was installed. Flagstaff became incorporated as a town in 1894. The city grew rapidly, primarily due to its location along the east–west transcontinental railroad line in the United States. By the 1890s, Flagstaff found itself along one of the busiest railroad corridors in the U.S., with about 80 to 100 trains traveling through the city every day, destined for Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere.Thomas W. Paradis, \\"From Downtown to Theme Town: Reinventing America's Smaller Historic Retail Districts\\", pp. 57–74 in The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation, and Self, ed. Scott A. Lukas (Lanham, Maryland, Lexington Books, 2007), In this decade, the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company was founded by the Riordan brothers to process timber. Michael and Tim Riordan worked in Flagstaff, and introduced electricity to the town for this purpose. The Riordans also built the Lake Mary area of Flagstaff, and Michael Riordan took a particular interest in protecting the surrounding native ruins of the present Walnut Canyon National Monument. The CO Bar Ranch was opened in about 1886 by the Babbitt brothers for cattle. Five Babbitt brothers from a mercantile background in Cincinnati – Billy, Charlie, Dave, Edward, and George – had set their eyes on becoming ranchers out West and sent Billy and Dave with $20,000 to buy a ranch; the brothers were told of some good, cheap, land just east of Flagstaff when in Albuquerque and took the railroad there, arriving in February 1886. alt=Commercial building with clock in foreground After some years, the other Babbitt brothers also moved to Flagstaff. Three of the brothers married three daughters of a Dutch merchant, who advised the men to expand their business across many avenues, which they did, opening all kinds of stores, theaters, and even a mortuary in 1892, investing their money across northern Arizona. They also introduced sheep to their cattle farm, with Billy and Charlie working as cowboys. The Babbitt family would be very influential in northern Arizona for decades (one descendant is former Governor of Arizona and Clinton's Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt). According to True West Magazine, \\"it was said, God made northern Arizona, and then he turned it over to the Babbitts to run.\\" The Northern Arizona Normal School was established in 1899, renamed Northern Arizona University (NAU) in 1966. In local culture, the Flagstaff Symphony made its concert debut at Babbitt's Opera House on April 11, 1899; the orchestra continues today as the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra, with its primary venue at the Ardrey Auditorium on the campus of Northern Arizona University.\\"History of the FSO .\\" Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra. Retrieved April 11, 2007. alt=Building On January 1, 1900, John Weatherford opened the Weatherford Hotel in Flagstaff. In c. 1900, journalist Sharlot Hall described the houses in Flagstaff as a \\"third rate mining camp\\", with bad air and expensive goods.Sharlot Hall's diary, quoted in the Plateau Journal of the Museum of Northern Arizona, v. 5 No. 1, 1991, p. 13 The Babbitts saw the height of their \\"cattle empire\\" between 1907 and 1919, with around 100 ranches between Kansas and California funded by the brothers in the 40 years after their arrival in Flagstaff; the brothers are remembered as benevolent, often allowing their partners running the ranches unlimited credit. In 1906, McMillan died; his family had been living in the Bank Hotel, which would soon pass to his son-in-law's family. Weatherford opened the town's first movie theater in 1911; it collapsed under heavy snowfall a few years later, but he soon replaced it with the Orpheum Theater. The Weatherford Hotel and Orpheum Theater are still in use today. The state of Arizona was admitted to the Union in 1912; one of the first two senators was Henry F. Ashurst, who had been born in Nevada but whose family moved to a ranch near Williams when he was two years old, with Ashurst attending school in Flagstaff. At the age of ten he showed his ambition to be a Senator by writing \\"Henry Fountain Ashurst, U.S. Senator from Arizona\\" into a speller. After dropping out of school at the age of thirteen, he worked as a cowboy on his father's ranch. At the age of nineteen, Ashurst was made the turnkey at the county jail in Flagstaff. While working at the jail, he developed an interest in the law by reading Blackstone's Commentaries. Ashurst was admitted to the bar in 1897 and began a law practice in Williams, and met his wife in Flagstaff. Flagstaff saw its first tourism boom in the early years of the 1900s, becoming known as the City of Seven Wonders, as the \\"Seven Wonders\\" of the wider Flagstaff area – listed as the Coconino National Forest, Grand Canyon, Oak Creek Canyon, San Francisco Peaks, Sunset Crater, Walnut Canyon, and Wupatki National Monument – were more widely known. Route 66 and city growth alt=Mountain on top, cityscape on bottom The railroad, which became the Santa Fe Railroad, had largely controlled Flagstaff – being its main source of industry and transport – until Route 66 was completed in 1926, with a section through Flagstaff. Route 66 had been supported by the businessmen of Flagstaff as early as 1912, knowing that the town was close to natural wonders that would make it a commercial opportunity, with the Babbitt family opening a car dealership. However, the university (then called Northern Arizona Teachers' College) and local media were against the rise of automobiles. Seeing a rise in tourism, the people of Flagstaff collectively funded the Hotel Monte Vista, which opened on January 1, 1927, with Weatherford having begun construction of a toll road up the nearby San Francisco Peaks in the early 1920s. Flagstaff was then incorporated as a city in 1928, with over 3,000 residents, and in 1929, the city's first motel, the Motel Du Beau, was built at the intersection of Beaver Street and Phoenix Avenue. The Daily Sun described the motel as \\"a hotel with garages for the better class of motorists.\\" The units originally rented for $2.60 to $5.00 each, with baths, toilets, double beds, carpets, and furniture. Flagstaff became a popular tourist stop along Route 66, particularly due to its proximity to the Grand Canyon, Painted Desert, and the Petrified Forest National Park. To combat Route 66, the Santa Fe Railroad opened a new depot in Flagstaff in 1926. As part of the celebrations, Front Street was renamed Santa Fe Avenue. In 1927, Flagstaff's primary industry was still timber, though farming persisted into the 1920s. The city produced the majority of Arizona's timber supply that year, and was economically powered by the competing Arizona Lumber and Timber and Flagstaff Lumber companies, but in the last years of the decade, tourism took over and the face of the main commercial district changed to diners and motels in place of saloons. In 1928 the Museum of Northern Arizona opened in the city, and in the same year its workers prevented the destruction of Sunset Crater for use in a movie explosion. At the start of the Great Depression, the massive expansion of Flagstaff and Coconino County during the 1920s was seen as likely unsustainable with a lower income. It was made worse by the unemployed workers traveling Route 66 to California stopping in Flagstaff, and young jobless Canadians venturing to the area for exploration having to be supported by the city before being deported. Southard wrote that the \\"down-on-their-luck migrants taxed the resources of their host cities, while contributing little to the local economy\\". Known as \\"auto nomads\\" in Flagstaff, out-of-work families relocating to the city with children were particularly taxing on the public school system, and even those that did not stay long became unpopular as they could not afford to buy gas or food. Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by Clyde Tombaugh's 1930 discovery of Pluto from the Lowell Observatory; the planet was in part named for Percival Lowell (PL). However, some Flagstaff residents attempted charitable endeavors, including setting up food banks and imploring hunters in the local area to donate a percentage of each kill to them. This did not last long, as in the winter of 1931–32, a rumor that California had closed its borders to Mid West migrants spread through Arizona, with people from places like Flagstaff and Yuma, the last cities on major cross-country highways before California, demanding that Arizona be closed to migrants, too. The importance of Route 66 to cross-country travel, and thus to Arizona's interests on a national level, did mean that it received a large share of state funding through the Depression, though, with highway maintenance and unemployment acts providing over $1 million of funding in May 1933. Flagstaff's unemployed soon became highway construction workers, and by the end of 1934, Flagstaff had financially recovered to pre-Depression levels, aided by tax cuts and continued tourism; in 1935, many residents had enough disposable income to remodel their homes or build new ones. In 1936, based on the city's continued economic upswing, General Petroleum announced it was building a new refinery just outside of town. The first hospital in the city was also opened in 1936, by Charles Sechrist. At the outbreak of World War II, Route 66, now well- paved and maintained, was used to transport military outfits, bringing more prosperity to Flagstaff and doubling its population. alt=Building with starry night sky People from the city had created the first ski run in the mountains in 1938, using a family cabin; in the 1950s Route 180 was paved north of the city to provide better access towards Valle for skiers and Grand Canyon tourists, making the city into a seasonal ski resort. In 1955 the U.S. Naval Observatory joined the growing astronomical presence, and established the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station, where Pluto's satellite Charon was discovered in 1978. The Naval Observatory also observed the Dark Sky presence of the area; in 1958, the city introduced light restrictions to maintain this. Through the 1950s the city conducted the Urban Renewal Project, improving housing quality in the Southside neighborhood that was largely populated by people of Spanish, Basque, and Mexican heritage. At the end of the 1950s, the Glen Canyon Dam was constructed north of the city, with the construction efforts meaning that a road that would become Interstate 17 between the town of Verde Valley and Flagstaff was laid to carry resources, providing better north–south access and directly connecting Flagstaff to Phoenix; scientists from the area also spent the decade to 1962, when Glen Canyon was flooded for the dam, documenting its archeological history. Flagstaff grew and prospered through the 1960s, with a train running through the city on average every eighteen minutes through the decade. In 1964, the Lowell Observatory received a designation as a National Historic Landmark. Buffalo Park, a large open park with free-roaming wildlife within the city, was opened in 1966. During the Apollo program in the 1960s, the Clark Telescope was used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to map the Moon for the lunar expeditions, enabling the mission planners to choose a safe landing site for the lunar modules.Putnam, William Lowell. \\"The explorers of Mars Hill : a centennial history of Lowell Observatory, 1894–1994.\\" West Kennebunk, Me. : Published for Lowell Observatory by Phoenix Pub., c1994. Astronauts also trained in the cinder cones around Flagstaff. In homage to the city's importance in the field of astronomy, a selection of asteroids and minor planets have been named in relation to the city, including 2118 Flagstaff, named for the city; 6582 Flagsymphony, named for the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra in its 50th season; 5463 Danwelcher, named for Dan Welcher to commemorate his conducting of the Flagstaff Symphony Orchestra, notably with a set itself commemorating the centenary of the Lowell Observatory and Flagstaff's founding; 1886 Lowell, named for the astronomer and discovered with his telescope; 793 Arizona, named by Lowell for the state in which it was discovered, at his observatory; 2939 Coconino, named for the county (the city and state names had already been assigned). Decline and resurgence As the baby boomer generation began to start their own families in the 1970s and 1980s, many moved to Flagstaff based on its small-town feel, and the population began to grow again; there were not enough jobs to support the many educated individuals moving to the city. W. L. Gore and Associates had opened a Flagstaff plant in 1967, and took on qualified workers. The student population (at college and high school) also grew, but the city did not expand its infrastructure downtown, causing problems. Several historic buildings from the 19th century were also destroyed for construction of new ones, or leveled completely. Downtown became an uninviting place, and many businesses started to move out of the area, causing an economic and social decline. Sears and J.C. Penney left the downtown area in 1979 to open up as anchor stores in the new Flagstaff Mall, joined in 1986 by Dillard's. By 1987, the Babbitt Brothers Trading Company, a retail fixture in Flagstaff since 1891, closed its doors at Aspen Avenue and San Francisco Street. To protect historic buildings in downtown, the Railroad Addition Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Also includes 1986 and 1997 boundary increases. In 1987, the city drafted a new master plan, also known as the Growth Management Guide 2000, which would transform downtown Flagstaff from a shopping and trade center into a regional center for finance, office use, and government. The city built a new city hall, library, and the Coconino County Administrative Building in the downtown district. During the 1990s, downtown instead became more cultural again. Store owners in downtown supported the Main Street programs of preservation-based revitalization, and in 1992, the city hired a new manager, Dave Wilcox, who had previously worked at revitalizing the downtown areas of Beloit, Wisconsin and Missoula, Montana. As a result, many of the downtown sidewalks were repaved with decorative brick facing and a different mix of shops and restaurants opened up to take advantage of the area's historical appeal. The historic sandstone buildings were restored, and parts of downtown became targeted towards tourism. After the Railroad Addition district became protected, and the historic quality of the city was appreciated by officials, more neighborhoods became registered as historic districts, controlling what works can take place. Heritage Square was built as the center of the revitalized downtown, including mapping the history of the area on various structures. The local Flagstaff Pulliam Airport began running more flights to Phoenix, allowing commuting, and the school district was expanded with a third high school, Sinagua High School. Microbreweries opened downtown in the early 1990s, as did craft restaurants, and a partnership to protect the surrounding forests was created. On October 24, 2001, Flagstaff was recognized by the International Dark-Sky Association as the world's first \\"International Dark-Sky City\\",Staff Writer. \\"Stellar ideas keep astronomy in state.\\" Arizona Republic. November 19, 2006. Retrieved October 14, 2007. and in 2012 it was officially named \\"America's First STEM Community\\" by Flagstaff Mayor Jerry Nabours. Industrial use of the city grew in the 21st century: SenesTech started in 2004, a major producer of pest control agents, and was the first publicly-traded company headquartered in Flagstaff until it downsized and moved to Phoenix in 2020. The Nestlé Purina PetCare factory in East Flagstaff is also a major industry hub, though is often under fire for making the city smell like dog food; mitigation acts were enforced in 2003 and 2020. A new industry also sprouted in the 2010s, with Flagstaff becoming an altitude training destination for elite athletes. While the first elite athletes to start altitude training in the city were those going to the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, the HYPO2 center in the city trained over 85 Olympic medalists from 44 countries between 2012 and 2019. Though the population and industry has continued to grow, the demographics have changed, and in 2010 Sinagua High School became a middle school to account for this.

The original demo was written, developed, and illustrated by Camila Gormaz. It features the first hour of the story, and was released for Windows and OSX on May 13, 2016. The game was released on March 28, 2018. In Long Gone Days, the player controls Rourke, a soldier from an underground unrecognized country named \\"The Core\\", after he's deployed to a mission in Kaliningrad, Russia. After discovering the truth about the operation he was part of, he decides to desert and find a way to prevent the upcoming war his homeland wants to provoke. The demo received mostly positive reviews, praising its writing and art. Reviewers especially enjoyed the use of a Morale system to motivate other party members, and the topical issues covered by the plot.  Plot  Long Gone Days takes place on the Earth during the present time, in an unofficial country named The Core, whose exact location is unknown. In this place, every individual is trained from birth for their job, so they can become experts by the time they become adults. The main character of the story, Rourke, is a military sniper who has never visited the surface. He's chosen as a last-minute replacement for an operation to aid the Polish forces in Kaliningrad, without much time to review the briefing. During this mission, after the player eliminates the targets they were assigned to shoot, Rourke finds out all of them were civilians, and he's told by the squad's combat medic, Adair, that it is in fact a false flag operation. Rourke is shocked by the revelation, and by the fact nobody in his squad seems to mind the war crimes they are committing, and without much thought, he finally takes the decision to desert. Intrigued by the outcome, Adair makes up his mind to follow Rourke along. Taking advantage of his specialty, Adair reports a false illness that requires transferring Rourke to the nearest field hospital, using this as an excuse to escape. Even though they are walking in the opposite direction of their two bases in Kaliningrad, their plan is quickly discovered as they get seen by drones and fellow soldiers from a nearby base they weren't told about, thus realizing the operation is much bigger than they were informed of. The demo ends with Rourke and Adair being chased by their own allies, as they have become deserters and enemies of The Core, while they try to process what are they going to do with their lives from now on.  Gameplay  Long Gone Days is a role-playing game with visual novel elements that uses a top-down perspective. It features a traditional turn-based RPG combat, which allows the player to select which body-part of the enemy to aim. Since the story doesn't have fantasy or supernatural elements, instead of magic, the characters rely on morale. This stat can be raised or lowered by the choices the player may choose during dialogues in and outside battles, and it affects how each party member will perform in battle. If their Morale reaches zero, the character loses their will to fight. Besides the turn-based combats, the game also features a first-person sniper mode, which consists of seek and find mechanics. Since the story is set in the real world, the NPCs will speak in their native language depending on the country the characters are in. The player can recruit interpreters in order to buy at shops and complete quests.  Development  Long Gone Days was originally conceived in 2003 by Gormaz as an RPG Maker 2000 project, but it wasn't until 2015 that the development of the demo began. The game was announced for the first time on the RPG Maker forums and TIG Source on January 17, 2016. On May 13, the Windows version of the demo was released, and an OSX port was released on July 14. On July 11, 2016, Gormaz launched a crowdfunding campaign on the website Indiegogo. The campaign reached its goal on August 11, 2016, ending with US$21,300 raised by 567 people. According to the developer, the game will be around 4 to 5 hours long, and it will have two different endings.  Reception  The demo of Long Gone Days received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, mostly appreciating the art style and the story. It received a score of 4.7/5 on Game Jolt, based on 480 ratings, and 5/5 on Itch.io. Reviewers praised the game's focus on the use of interpreters, with Maddi Chilton of Kill Screen commenting \\"Not only do they add realism to a game that deals with international military, but they bring into the spotlight something that people often forget: it's not only the soldiers shooting guns that are crucial to a war\\".

History Originally called The Adelaide Hounds, the club was founded in Adelaide in the early 1840s. Adelaide Hunt Club. As early as 3 July 1841, the Governor of South Australia Sir George Grey KCB along with about 25 horsemen, hounds and ladies in carriages met for a day’s hunting, on this day a wild dog was the quarry. Without foxes to hunt, wild dogs, kangaroos and emus were the early quarry.Brown. Due to lack of support, hunting declined in Adelaide and the pack was dispersed in the 1850s but was revived in 1869 by a group of wealthy sportsmen led by William Blackler, who imported sufficient hounds to form a pack. The first hunt with his pack was held on 24 May of that year and attracted many interested huntsmen and spectators. In 1871, after a dispute with the Club, Blackler withdrew his support, and at the instigation of James A. Ellery passed his pack to the newly-formed South-East (later Mount Gambier) Hunt Club. Deer hunting was attempted on several occasions, but provided rather pedestrian sport Some interesting details, particulaarly of the Downers. and the most interesting riding was provided by drag hunting, where an aniseed scent trail was dragged over a course guaranteed to present challenges to the abilities of horse and rider. The club is very closely linked with the city’s history with events such as the annual ball and steeplechase being social highlights of the new colony. The pack was originally kennelled at various locations on the Adelaide Plains although urban expansion meant they had to move in the late-1900s. The club's current kennels are located at Woodside in the Adelaide Hills. In 1901 Simpson Newland was president of the club, which at that time held regular meets in the Erindale area.

The station is owned by Southern Cross Austereo.Hot FM CQ website History In the late 1990s, DMG Regional Radio successfully bid for an FM broadcasting license for a radio station in the Rockhampton/Gladstone market in Central Queensland. In October 2000, Hot FM was launched. The station was a new addition to the existing Hot FM network of stations, also owned by DMG Regional Radio. The Central Queensland Hot FM station was originally created to attract the younger demographics that didn't listen to DMG's established classic hits station, Gladstone's 4CC which also broadcast to Rockhampton. The station originally broadcast its local breakfast program from a studio in Rockhampton, and sourced its daytime and overnight programming from Hot FM Townsville. Since its inception, Hot FM has broadcast on two separate frequencies in Rockhampton and Gladstone. When Hot FM was launched, RG Capital also launched an FM station in Rockhampton, Sea FM to attract a younger demographics that didn't find RG Capital's established AM station 4RO appealing. For the first few years, Sea FM and Hot FM were fierce rivals, battling for the same demographic of listeners. In 2004, DMG Regional Radio merged with RG Capital to form Macquarie Regional RadioWorks, which saw all four local Central Queensland stations owned by the same company. Macquarie Regional Radioworks were legally obligated to offload at least two stations, and decided to sell their two AM stations, 4RO and 4CC to Prime Media Group. This meant the two FM stations that were once rivals found themselves as sister stations. In 2005, Hot FM decided to cease broadcasting content from Rockhampton. While the local Hot FM sales office was moved into the existing 4RO and Sea FM studio complex, the local breakfast program began being broadcast from the existing 4CC building in Gladstone. When this occurred, the breakfast announcer that had been with Hot FM since its inception moved over to Hot FM's new stablemate, Sea FM so he continue working in Rockhampton in 2005, while his Hot FM co-host moved to the afternoon shift on Sea FM. Hot FM began broadcasting its local breakfast show from the Gladstone studio on 24 January 2005.Smithy will move to Sea FM, Evan Schwarten, The Morning Bulletin, 29 December 2004Sea change for radio's Smithy, The Morning Bulletin, 17 January 2005, radioinfo.com.au, 29 January 2005 Although no longer stablemates, 4CC and Hot FM have continued to share the same building in Gladstone since the merger.

It was the first time since 2001 that ratings for the Rockhampton/Gladstone market have been calculated. According to the ratings, Hot FM performed best in the 10-17 and 18-24 demographics, with 53.2% and 52.5% audience share respectively. The most listened to timeslot was the 4pm-7pm afternoon drive shift with 33.7% audience share. The station's midday-4pm shift also beat all the stations in that timeslot.

Biography Petrini was born in Pontremoli, and trained in Parma and Rome. As a mature painter was recruited by Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo to serve as the first professors of a newly-reformed Accademia di Belle Arti of Florence. He was assisted by Giuseppe Piattoli. Subsequent generations had a poor impression of the man: Saltini in his History of Fine Arts of Tuscany said of him:fu mediocrissimo pittore; e se ottenne per cabala d'esser posto alla direzione dell' insegnamento di pittura nell'Accademia fiorentina, ciò fu a maggior danno dell' arte. Poco avea disegnato e meno dipinto prima d'ottenere codesto ufficio, nulla più fece poi; e abbandonati affatto i pennelli, parlò sempre ai giovani scuolari, ma non disse loro pure una volta, ecco come si opera. Guai ai maestri dell' arte che disputano e scrivono, soleva dire il Canova, è segno che non osano e non sanno fare. in Le arti belle in Toscana da mezzo il secolo XVIII ai di nostri: memoria storica, by Guglielmo Enrico Saltini, p. 45. > He was mediocre painter; and he obtained his position by some cabal, and > after being placed in the direction of teaching of Florentine painting in > the Academy, he did great damage to art. Little had he drawn, and less > painted less before his appointment; he did nothing afterward, and > completely abandoned the brushes. He always spoke to young pupils, but never > once said, here's how it works. Woe to art teachers who argue and write, > used to say Canova, it is a sign that they dare not and can not do (art). Others are less biting, for example, Francesco Inghirami said that:Stabilitosi in Firenze lavorò poco e di malavoglia per la poca salute che aveva. Se il giusto pubblico non trova in lui un raro pittore, vi trova un maestro egregio, dotto nelle teorie, facondissimo e amorevolissimo nell'insegnare ai suoi allievi from Storia della Toscana: compilata ed in sette epoche distribuita, Volume 11, by Francesco Inghirami, p. 327. > He settled in Florence but worked little and reluctantly due to his poor > health he had.

It is one of many Monopoly video game adaptions. The game was developed by Artech Studios and published by Hasbro Interactive. It was released exclusively for Microsoft Windows computers. The game employs the same basic ruleset of traditional Monopoly gameplay, but the Star Wars theme includes famous characters and locales in place of the original game pieces and properties. Gameplay FMV clip plays. The gameplay closely resembles that of the original source material. Players begin by selecting a game piece, each modeled after famous Star Wars characters. Playable characters consist of Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, Boba Fett and Stormtrooper. Whilst the game pieces appear to be cast metal during piece selection, during gameplay they are fully animated and are textured to look like their film counterparts. Players can choose up to four players, with up to three AI players if a person wishes to play solo. Several options allow players to customize the game to their preferences. C-3PO serves as narrator for the game, voiced by Anthony Daniels. After character selection, play begins with a perspective view of the board, with a starship representing each player flanking each side. These starships display player's current funds and properties available, and also have an identical character piece attached to the side of the ship. Traditional Monopoly properties are replaces with various Star Wars locales, whilst corner spaces such as Free Parking are kept the same. Instead of building houses and hotels, players accumulate starports. Once a player rolls their turn, the camera shifts to a side-view perspective. This sequence contains animation and clips from the films, which play out when players land on their designated space. Players also had the option to compete in multiplayer LAN games, and observe such games through Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone, through agreements with Microsoft and Sony Online Entertainment. Zone Support for CD-ROM games ceased on Juny 19, 2006. GameRanger has since enabled support for it, reviving its multiplayer functionality. Development Previously, Hasbro had created a board game version of Star Wars Monopoly, which has sold very well; 1997 was the year of a Special Edition version of the Star Wars original trilogy, so it was decided to release a video game version for the Christmas season, to build on the Monopoly franchise. Programmer Alexander G. M. Smith was in charge of software design for the rules engine. The 3D crew produced a sizzle reel to show Hasbro, and the project was approved. Anthony Daniels, who portrays the droid C3PO in the Star Wars films, contributed his writing skills to the game. During the development process, the \\"simple but effective dialog boxes and 2D board were replaced by fancy animations, sound effects, and speech\\". Due to the rushed development toward the end, certain features such as a user interface for trading immunities and futures was left out, while a Japanese version of the title was postponed. The game was officially finished on October 18, 1997. Upon the title's announcement, Jack Sorensen, president of LucasArts, explained \\"the Star Wars franchise will expand to a much broader audience who will now have an opportunity to experience two cultural icons in a whole new way.\\" Meanwhile, Hasbro Interactive President Tom Dusenberry commented that \\"both of these entertainment properties are so ingrained in our culture..together they create an even bigger, more thrilling entertainment experience\\". The game was officially previewed at the 1997 Children's Interactive Expo. Hasbro Interactive launched a companion website for the game in October–November 1997. Reception Monopoly Star Wars received mixed reviews upon its release. It won the 1998 Software Publishers Association Award for \\"Best Use of Visual Arts in Multimedia\\". It made Eurogamer's December 2016 list of notable Star Wars spinoffs. Nick Smith of AllGame liked that the game did more than simply slap the Star Wars name on a Monopoly game; rather the design authentically incorporate aspects of the Star Wars universe. Similarly, The Adrenaline Vault's Jim Brambaugh noted the game's \\"authenticity\\", noting the potential for a quick cash-in through the merging of the popular Star Wars and Monopoly franchises. Walter Morbeck of GameSpot thought the melding of the two properties was a good idea, but that the resulting game was \\"somewhat pointless\\". The Boston Globe's Kathy McCabe thought the endeavour \\"married tradition and pop culture\\". Robin Ray of The Boston Herald deemed the game \\"marvelous\\". The Cincinnati Post's Pam Gleichman said aspects of the game were \\"classic\\" and \\"stunning\\".

It became the preeminent Greek polis in the Hellenized region of southern Gaul.Patrick Boucheron, et al., eds. France in the World: A New Global History (2019) pp 30-35. The city-state allied with the Roman Republic against Carthage during the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), retaining its independence and commercial empire throughout the western Mediterranean even as Rome expanded into Western Europe and North Africa. However, the city lost its independence following the Roman Siege of Massilia in 49 BC, during Caesar's Civil War, in which Massalia sided with the exiled faction at war with Julius Caesar. Marseille continued to prosper as a Roman city, becoming an early center of Christianity during the Western Roman Empire. The city maintained its position as a premier maritime trading hub even after its capture by the Visigoths in the 5th century AD, although the city went into decline following the sack of 739 AD by the forces of Charles Martel. It became part of the County of Provence during the 10th century, although its renewed prosperity was curtailed by the Black Death of the 14th century and sack of the city by the Crown of Aragon in 1423. The city's fortunes rebounded with the ambitious building projects of René of Anjou, Count of Provence, who strengthened the city's fortifications during the mid-15th century. During the 16th century the city hosted a naval fleet with the combined forces of the Franco-Ottoman alliance, which threatened the ports and navies of Genoa and the Holy Roman Empire. Marseille lost a significant portion of its population during the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720, but the population recovered by mid century. In 1792 the city became a focal point of the French Revolution and was the birthplace of France's national anthem, La Marseillaise. The Industrial Revolution and establishment of the French Empire during the 19th century allowed for further expansion of the city, although it was captured and heavily damaged by Nazi Germany during World War II. The city has since become a major center for immigrant communities from former French colonies, such as French Algeria. Prehistory Prehistoric outline of human hand, Cosquer Cave Humans have inhabited Marseille and its environs for almost 30,000 years: palaeolithic cave paintings in the underwater Cosquer Cave near the calanque of Morgiou date back to between 27,000 and 19,000 BC; and recent excavations near the railway station have unearthed neolithic brick habitations from around 6000 BC.J. Buisson-Catil, I. Sénépart, Marseille avant Marseille. La fréquentation préhistorique du site. Archéologia, no. 435, July–August 2006, pages 28–31 Antiquity Massalia, whose name was probably adapted from an existing language related to Ligurian, was the first Greek settlement in France. It was established within modern Marseille around 600 BC by colonists coming from Phocaea (now Foça, in modern Turkey) on the Aegean coast of Asia Minor. The connection between Massalia and the Phoceans is mentioned in Thucydides's Peloponnesian War; he notes that the Phocaean project was opposed by the Carthaginians, whose fleet was defeated. The founding of Massalia has also been recorded as a legend. According to the legend, Protis (in Aristotle, Euxenes), a native of Phocae, while exploring for a new trading outpost or emporion to make his fortune, discovered the Mediterranean cove of the Lacydon, fed by a freshwater stream and protected by two rocky promontories. Protis was invited inland to a banquet held by the chief of the local Ligurian tribe, Nann, for suitors seeking the hand of his daughter Gyptis (in Aristotle, Petta) in marriage. At the end of the banquet, Gyptis presented the ceremonial cup of wine to Protis, indicating her unequivocal choice. Following their marriage, they moved to the hill just to the north of the Lacydon; and from this settlement grew Massalia. Later, the natives would treacherously lay a plot to destroy the new colony, but the scheme was divulged and Conran, king of the natives, was killed in the ensuing battle.M. Guizot, History of France, Vol. I., chap. I., Gaul (Kindle Edition) Robb gives greater weight to the Gyptis story, though he notes that the tradition was to offer water, not wine, to signal the choice of a marriage partner. A second wave of colonists arrived in about 540, when Phocaea was destroyed by the Persians. The state of Gaul around 58 BC. Massalia became one of the major trading ports of the ancient world. At its height, in the 4th century BC, it had a population of about 50,000 inhabitants on about fifty hectares surrounded by a wall. It was governed as an aristocratic republic, with an assembly formed by the 600 wealthiest citizens. It had a large temple of the cult of Apollo of Delphi on a hilltop overlooking the port and a temple of the cult of Artemis of Ephesus at the other end of the city. The drachmas minted in Massalia were found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Traders from Massalia ventured into France on the rivers Durance and Rhône and established overland trade routes to Switzerland and Burgundy, reaching as far north as the Baltic Sea. They exported their own products: local wine, salted pork and fish, aromatic and medicinal plants, coral, and cork. The most famous citizen of Massalia was the mathematician, astronomer and navigator Pytheas. Pytheas made mathematical instruments, which allowed him to establish almost exactly the latitude of Marseille, and he was the first scientist to observe that the tides were connected with the phases of the moon. Between 330 and 320 BC, he organized an expedition by ship into the Atlantic and as far north as England, and to visit Iceland, Shetland, and Norway, where he was the first scientist to describe drift ice and the midnight sun. Though he hoped to establish a sea trading route for tin from Cornwall, his trip was not a commercial success, and it was not repeated. The Massiliots found it cheaper and simpler to trade with Northern Europe over land routes. Jardin des Vestiges near the Vieux-Port with remains of the Hellenic harbour at Massalia The city thrived by acting as a link between inland Gaul, hungry for Roman goods and wine (which Massalia was steadily exporting by 500 BC), and Rome's insatiable need for new products and slaves. During the Punic Wars, Hannibal crossed the Alps north of the city. In 123 BC, Massalia was faced by an invasion of the Allobroges and Arverni under Bituitus; it entered into an alliance with Rome, receiving protection—Roman legions under Q. Fabius Maximus and Gn. Domitius Ahenobarbus defeated the Gauls at Vindalium in 121 BC—in exchange for yielding a strip of land through its territory which was used to construct the Via Domitia, a road to Spain. The city thus maintained its independence a little longer, although the Romans organized their province of Transalpine Gaul around it and constructed a colony at Narbo Martius (Narbonne) in 118 BC which subsequently competed economically with Massalia. Caesar's siege in 49 BC. During Julius Caesar's war against Pompey and most of the Senate, Massalia allied itself with the exiled government; closing its gates to Caesar on his way to Spain in April of 49 BC, the city was besieged. Despite reinforcement by L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, Massalia's fleet was defeated and the city fell by September. It maintained nominal autonomy but lost its trading empire and was largely brought under Roman dominion. The statesman Titus Annius Milo, then living in exile in Marseille, joked that no one could miss Rome as long as they could eat the delicious red mullet of Marseille. Marseille adapted well to its new status under Rome. Most of the archaeological remnants of the original Greek settlement were replaced by later Roman additions. During the Roman era, the city was controlled by a directory of 15 selected \\"first\\" among 600 senators. Three of them had the pre-eminence and the essence of the executive power. The city's laws among other things forbade the drinking of wine by women and allowed, by a vote of the senators, assistance to a person to commit suicide. It was during this time that Christianity first appeared in Marseille, as evidenced by catacombs above the harbour and records of Roman martyrs. The martyrdom of St. Victor took place under the Roman Emperor Maximian. According to Provençal tradition, Mary Magdalen evangelised Marseille with her brother Lazarus. The diocese of Marseille was set up in the 1st century (it became the Archdiocese of Marseille in 1948). Middle Ages and Renaissance Marseille in 1575 The city was not affected by the decline of the Roman Empire before the 8th century, as Marseille knew a stable situation, probably thanks to its efficient defensive walls inherited from the Phoceans. Even after the town fell into the hands of the Visigoths in the 5th century, the city became an important Christian intellectual center with people such as John Cassian, Salvian and Sidonius Apollinaris. Marseille even knew a golden age in the 6th century, when it became a major commercial center in the Mediterranean Sea. Late Antiquity continued until the 7th century in Marseille, with Phocean and Roman infrastructures still in use (forums, baths). Marseille's economic activities and prosperity ended suddenly with attacks by Charles Martel in 739, when Martel's armies punished the city for rejecting the governor he had established a few years earlier. The city did not develop again before the 10th century, as it knew 150 years of recurring attacks from the Greeks and the Saracens. The city regained much of its wealth and trading power when it was revived in the 10th century by the Counts of Provence. The Counts of Provence allowed Marseille, governed by a consul, great autonomy until the rule of Raymond Berengar IV of Provence. Marseille initially resisted his assertion of control, but acknowledged his suzerainty in 1243. After his death, his daughter Beatrice of Provence married Louis IX of France's brother Charles I of Anjou in 1246, making him Count. Charles continued his father-in- law's administrative changes, which reignited discontent. Marseille rebelled in 1248, under the leadership of two local nobles, Barral of Baux and Boniface of Castellane, while Charles was embarked on the Seventh Crusade. Charles returned in 1250 and forced Marseille to surrender in 1252. Marseille rose up once more, in 1262, under Boniface of Castellane and Hugues des Baux, cousin of Barral des Baux (who remained loyal and helped contain the unrest). Charles quelled the revolt in 1263. Trade prospered, and Marseille gave him no further trouble. In 1348, the city suffered terribly from the bubonic plague, which continued to strike intermittently until 1361. As a major port, it is believed that Marseille was one of the first places in France to encounter the epidemic, and some 15,000 people died in a city that had a population of 25,000 during its period of economic prosperity in the previous century. The city's fortunes declined still further when it was sacked and pillaged by the Aragonese in 1423. Fort Saint-Jean, incorporating the 12C Commandry of the Knights Hospitaller of St John and the 15C tower of René I Marseille's population and trading status soon recovered and in 1437, the Count of Provence René of Anjou, who succeeded his father Louis II of Anjou as King of Sicily and Duke of Anjou, arrived in Marseille and established it as France's most fortified settlement outside of Paris. (in French) He helped raise the status of the town to a city and allowed certain privileges to be granted to it. Marseille was then used by the Duke of Anjou as a strategic maritime base to reconquer his kingdom of Sicily. King René, who wished to equip the entrance of the port with a solid defense, decided to build on the ruins of the old Maubert tower and to establish a series of ramparts guarding the harbour. Jean Pardo, engineer, conceived the plans and Jehan Robert, mason of Tarascon, carried out the work. The construction of the new city defenses took place between 1447 and 1453. Trading in Marseille also flourished as the Guild began to establish a position of power within the merchants of the city. Notably, René also founded the Corporation of Fisherman. Contemporary engraving of Marseille during the Great Plague of 1720. Marseille was united with Provence in 1481 and then incorporated into France the following year, but soon acquired a reputation for rebelling against the central government. Some 30 years after its incorporation, Francis I visited Marseille, drawn by his curiosity to see a rhinoceros that King Manuel I of Portugal was sending to Pope Leo X, but which had been shipwrecked on the Île d'If. As a result of this visit, the fortress of Château d'If was constructed; this did little to prevent Marseille being placed under siege by the army of the Holy Roman Empire a few years later. Marseille became a naval base for the Franco-Ottoman alliance in 1536, as a Franco-Turkish fleet was stationed in the harbour, threatening the Holy Roman Empire and especially Genoa. Towards the end of the 16th century, Marseille suffered yet another outbreak of the plague; the hospital of the Hôtel-Dieu was founded soon afterwards. A century later more troubles were in store: King Louis XIV himself had to descend upon Marseille, at the head of his army, in order to quash a local uprising against the governor. As a consequence, the two forts of Saint-Jean and Saint-Nicholas were erected above the harbour and a large fleet and arsenal were established in the harbour itself. 18th and 19th centuries La Marseillaise 1792 Bond of the City of Marseille from the 20. July 1894, unissued Over the course of the 18th century, the port's defences were improved1720 chart of Marseille: a contemporary chart showing the defenses of the port. and Marseille became more important as France's leading military port in the Mediterranean. In 1720, the last Great Plague of Marseille, a form of the Black Death, killed 100,000 people in the city and the surrounding provinces. Jean-Baptiste Grosson, royal notary, wrote from 1770 to 1791 the historical Almanac of Marseille, published as Recueil des antiquités et des monuments marseillais qui peuvent intéresser l'histoire et les arts (\\"Collection of antiquities and Marseille monuments which can interest history and the arts\\"), which for a long time was the primary resource on the history of the monuments of the city. The local population enthusiastically embraced the French Revolution and sent 500 volunteers to Paris in 1792 to defend the revolutionary government; their rallying call to revolution, sung on their march from Marseille to Paris, became known as La Marseillaise, now the national anthem of France. During the 19th century, the city was the site of industrial innovations and growth in manufacturing. The rise of the French Empire and the conquests of France from 1830 onward (notably Algeria) stimulated the maritime trade and raised the prosperity of the city. Maritime opportunities also increased with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This period in Marseille's history is reflected in many of its monuments, such as the Napoleonic obelisk at Mazargues and the royal triumphal arch on the Place Jules Guesde. 1900 up to World War II David Dellepiane: poster for 1906 colonial exhibition During the first half of the 20th century, Marseille celebrated its \\"port of the empire\\" status through the colonial exhibitions of 1906 and 1922; the monumental staircase of the railway station, glorifying French colonial conquests, dates from then. In 1934, Alexander I of Yugoslavia arrived at the port to meet with the French foreign minister Louis Barthou. He was assassinated there by Vlado Chernozemski. In the interwar period, Marseille was known for its extensive organised crime networks. Simon Kitson has shown how this corruption extended into local administrations like the Police. During the Second World War, Marseille was bombed by German and Italian forces in 1940. The city was occupied by the Germans from November 1942 to August 1944. On 22 January 1943, over 4,000 Jews were seized in Marseille as part of \\"Action Tiger\\". They were held in detention camps before being deported to Poland occupied by Nazi Germany to be murdered. The Old Port was destroyed in January 1943 by the Germans. The city was liberated by the Allies on 29 August 1944. As a part of Operation Dragoon, General Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert led roughly 130,000 French troops to liberate the city. Similar to the liberation of other major French cities (such as Paris and Strasbourg), the local German garrison was defeated by mainly French forces, with limited American support. Marseille after World War II After the war, much of the city was rebuilt during the 1950s. The governments of East Germany, West Germany and Italy paid massive reparations, plus compound interest, to compensate civilians killed, injured, left homeless or destitute as a result of the war. From the 1950s onward, the city served as an entrance port for over a million immigrants to France. In 1962, there was a large influx from the newly independent Algeria, including around 150,000 returned Algerian settlers (pieds-noirs). Many immigrants have stayed and given the city a French-African quarter with a large market. In December 1994, Marseille was where the GIGN stormed Air France Flight 8969, which had been hijacked by 4 Islamic GIA terrorists. All four hijackers were killed and the passengers were freed.

It has four member organizations: Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Visually Impaired (FECASDEV), Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Physically Disabled (FECASDEP), Cameroonian Federation of Sports the Intellectually Disabled (FECASDI) and the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Deaf (FECASSO). The President of the Cameroonian Paralympic Committee is Jean Jacques Ndoudoumou. The organization has four vice presidents, who all serve as the presidents of CNPC's member organizations. The CNPC's history dates to the early 2010s, following a period where the country's previous National Paralympic Committee (NPC) had poor relations with the government of Cameroon and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). After the CNPC was formally created and recognized by law, the created a strategic plan and set about capacity building activities. The CNPC has some funding via grants and sponsorship. Future success for the CNPC is perceived by insiders as being dependent on government support for the Paralympic movement in Cameroon.  Governance  The CNPC has four member organizations.

He also served as the President of the Cameroon branch of the World Association for Advocacy and Solidarity of Albinos (ASMODISA).The name of the organization in French is, '. He got the role following the elections for the position in August 2011, winning a four-year term after collecting 84 of the 87 available votes where he was the only candidate running.

Those same elections also saw Ebot Ntui become a Vice President. He had previously served as the ministre chargé de missions à la Présidence de la République. Etienne Songa has been CNPC's Secretary General since 2009. In October 2014, Songa traveled to Brazzaville, Congo to give a presentation to the Congolese National Paralympic Committee (French: Comité national paralympique congolais). The organization has four vice presidents, who all serve as the presidents of CNPC's member organizations. These vice-presidents include FECASDI's Jean- Marie Aléokol Mabiemé, FECASDEP's Herve Guy Ngoyo Ngon, FECASDEV's Norbert Tsoungui and FECASSO's Pierre Valery Pemha. Other officers and key organizational personnel include Vice President Ogork Ntui Obot, Chief Financial Officer Christophe Ampoam, Deputy Secretary General Nazaire Ubalt Olinga, Deputy Financial Officer Jules Benjamin Mateck Ma Bilolo’o, Athlete Representative Constance Nchifi and Coach Representative Martin Luther Adibita. The organization's mission is to develop partnerships and mobilize resources in Cameroon to support the country's para-sportspeople. They have a vision of developing para-sports in Cameroon to assist in creating a society that is more inclusive and equitable for people with disabilities. They are supposed to be apolitical in all their dealings. The organization is headquartered in Yaounde.  History  Prior to the creation of the CNPC, the NPC for Cameroon was the Cameroonian Sports Federation for People with Disabilities (FECASH). The Federation had a number of issues including lack of organizational status, potentially not being recognized by the Cameroonian government and by the IPC, and claims of several NPCs all claiming to represent Cameroon being in existence. Cameroon's NPC had also been repeatedly suspended by the IPC as a result of problems related to the Ministry of Sports and the CNPC, with the IPC recognizing the CNPC but the Government of Cameroon not recognizing the CNPC as the country's NPC, and because the NPC had failed to pay IPC membership fees. One suspension occurred in 2003, and another from 2005 that included 2008, 2009 and 2010. Law No. 2011-18 of 15 July 2011 related to the organization and promotion of Physical and Sporting Activities created by force of law the government recognized Cameroonian National Paralympic Committee, addressing earlier issues related to lack of government recognition of a National Paralympic Committee. FECASH had been dissolved by the same law. The law recognized and made FECASDEV, FECASDEP, FECASDI and FECASSO as four member federations of the CNPC. Following the formal legislative creation of the CNPC in 2011, the organization and its four new member organizations had 30 days to hold elections for the boards of these organizations. Candidates to head the CNPC were already known prior to the election announcement, with FECASH Chairman Abeng Mbozo'o having bowed out of contention before then. The process leading to the CNPC's creation began in March 2011. The organization changed their name to \\"Comité National Paralympique Camerounais (CNPC)\\" on August 21, 2011. The name change and changes in the law signaled major change in the organization. In December 2011 in Beijing, the CNPC participated in their first IPC Congress. The changes normalized the CNPC's relationship with the International Paralympic Committee, and the country's athletes were then eligible to compete in some competitions because of the Paralympic Solidarity program. The CNPC developed a strategic plan for period of 2013 to 2016. This plan was designed to prepare the country for the 2016 Summer Paralympics. It had seven major objectives. These included improving organizational structure, developing human and institutional resources, sustaining and improving para-sports physical infrastructure and sporting equipment, increase awareness of para-sports, creating athlete development pathways, and ensure Cameroonian participation in national and international events. The NPC had their first website in 2012 as part of efforts by the International Paralympic Committee to increase the digital presence for its member nations. This website was designed with the goal of providing information for sportspeople on the local level all the way up to the elite level of Paralympic sport in Cameroon. The website was in French. In December 2012, the NPC participated in an athletics (track and field) training seminar organized by the IPC in Dakar, Senegal for French speaking African countries. Jean-Marie Aléokol Mabiemé co-wrote a guide called, \\"Guide du Sport pour Personne vivant avec un Handicap\\". In 2014, he was a trainer at a CONFEJES event in Yaoundé organized by the Ministry of Sports and Physical Education and the Paralympic Committee of Cameroon. Twenty sports administrators from four Central African countries participated in the conference. In 2014, the NPC hosted a capacity building workshop in coordination with the IPC Academy. Capacity building inside NPCs like Cameroon was part of the IPC's Strategic Plan to improve NPC capacity and efficiency in governance, management, leadership and sport promotion in member countries. Other countries that held similar workshops in 2013 and 2014 included Ghana, Cape Verde, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Liberia, Puerto Rico, Serbia, Seychelles, and Vanuatu.  Funding  One of the sources for funding of the disability sports movement in Cameroon has been Agitos Foundation grants. In 2014, the NPC received a grant to promote Paralympic Sport in the country. The NPC received a grant of €800 ahead of the Rio Games to promote Paralympic and para-sports before, during and after the Paralympic Games. This grant was part of the Organisational Capacity Programme (OCP). The money was used by Cameroon to host a come and try it event in July 2016, and used to get additional media coverage from radio and television news. In June 2016, the CNPC signed a sponsorship agreement with MACRON to provide the kit for the Cameroon team at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The CNPC viewed this historic sponsorship deal as important towards the continued professionalization of Paralympic sport in Cameroon. Success going forward in the Paralympic movement is perceived by those involved with para-sports in Cameroon as being dependent on the government for continued and increased support.

Developed by American studio Nexa Corporation and published by Sega itself, this title was one of many inspired by the property. According to Game Freaks 365, the game was \\"one of the first real boardgames that was programmed\\" into a video game. Gameplay The game contains very similar gameplay to the board game it is based on, with various physical tasks being replaced by automation and digital representations. Up to ten players can join in the game. Development For some time, Sega had wanted the license rights to Monopoly. Parker Brothers granted them the license in 1987 via Tonka. The idea was to adapt popular board games to increase the Sega Master System's place in the United States. Due to Japan's unfamiliarity of American board games, Japanese programmers could not develop the game. Sega turned their attention to Nexa, which was based in San Francisco. After three months of development, the team was behind schedule, so Nexa hired two programmers Kevin Seghetti and Lawrence Statton for $10,500 each. Due to the bad quality of the programming code, Kevin and Lawrence had to start from scratch. The use of the inaccurate and buggy Sega Graphic Tools made it difficult to implement the game graphics. In addition there were no available storage devices for the data, forcing the two programmers to format used ones. With a lot of time spent improving the game's graphic and programming quality, the game was finished six months later, three months after Sega's intended deadline. Critical reception Jonathan Sutyak of Allgame deemed the video game a \\"perfect translation\\" of the board game, praising the detailed graphics while commenting on the unforgiving AI. ACE Magazine recommended the title due to it being an adaptation of a popular and fun board game, though noted that the small digital representation of the board meant it could be challenging to see clearly who owns which properties and how many houses/hotels they have. The Video Game Critic thought the game was \\"respectable\\" as a single-player game with computer opponents, but felt that it didn't replace the board game when it comes to multiplayer human play. 1UP! said the game's AI had \\"unbearable stupidity\\", though the graphics were impressive for its age. Game Freaks 365 described the game's sound effects as \\"terrible\\", and wrote that the gameplay didn't offer anything that the player couldn't get from the board game; the site also negatively compared it to the NES version released in 1991.

The Gauls named the settlement RatumacosRatu- is not well explained; -macus, magus is a familiar toponymic suffix signifying \\"plain\\". and the Romans called it Rotomagus.As in Ammianus Marcellinus and the Notitia dignitatum; other variants: Ratomagos (Ptolemy, Geography), Ratomagos (Antonine Itinerary, Tabula Peutingeriana). Roman Rotomagus was the second city of Gallia Lugdunensis, after Lugdunum (Lyon). After the reorganization of the empire by Diocletian, Rouen became the chief city of the divided province of Gallia Lugdunensis II and reached the peak of its Roman development, with an amphitheatre and thermae, the foundations of which remain today. In the 5th century, it became the seat of a bishopric and later a capital of Merovingian Neustria. The Middle Ages After the first Viking incursion into the lower valley of the Seine in 841,Recorded in the chronicle of Fontenelle Abbey. they went on to overrun Rouen, and some of them settled and founded a colony led by Rollo (Hrolfr), who was nominated to be count of Rouen by King Charles in 911. In the 10th century Rouen became the capital of the Duchy of Normandy and the residence of the dukes, until William the Conqueror established his castle at Caen. During the early 12th century, the city's population reached 30,000. In 1150, Rouen received its founding charter, which permitted self-government. During the 12th century, Rouen was probably the site of a Jewish yeshiva. At that time, about 6,000 Jews lived in the town, comprising about 20% of the total population. The well-preserved remains of a medieval Jewish building, that could be a yeshiva, were discovered in the 1970s under the Rouen Law Courts. City Hall and Church of St. Ouen, Rouen In 1200, a fire destroyed part of Rouen's Romanesque cathedral, leaving just St Romain's tower, the side porches of its front, and part of the nave. New work on the present Gothic cathedral of Rouen began, in the nave, transept, choir, and the lowest section of the lantern tower. On 24 June 1204, Philip Augustus entered Rouen and annexed Normandy to the Royal Demesne. The fall of Rouen meant the end of Normandy's vassal state status. He demolished the Norman castle and replaced it with his own, the Château Bouvreuil, built on the site of the Gallo-Roman amphitheatre.With the exception of the tower associated with Joan of Arc, which was restored by Viollet-le-Duc, the castle was destroyed at the end of the 15th century, its stones used for other buildings. A textile industry developed based on wool imported from England, competing with the northern County of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant. The city found its market niche in the Champagne fairs. Rouen also depended on the river traffic of the Seine for its prosperity. Wine and wheat were exported to England, with tin and wool received in return. In the late 13th century, urban strife threatened the city: in 1291, the mayor was assassinated and noble residences in the city were pillaged. Philip IV restored order and suppressed the city's charter and the city's lucrative monopoly on river traffic, but he was quite willing to allow the Rouennais to repurchase their former liberties in 1294. In 1306, he decided to expel the Jewish community of Rouen, which then numbered some five or six thousand in the city of 40,000 people. 14th century timber framing, rue du Petit Mouton In 1389, another urban revolt of the underclass broke out, the Harelle. It was part of a widespread rebellion in France that year and was suppressed with the withdrawal of Rouen's charter and river-traffic privileges once more.

During the Hundred Years' War, on 19 January 1419, Rouen and its population of 70,000 surrendered to Henry V of England, who annexed Normandy once again to the Plantagenet domains. But Rouen did not go quietly: Alain Blanchard hung English prisoners from the walls, for which he was summarily executed; the Canon and Vicar General of Rouen, Robert de Livet, became heroes for excommunicating the English king, which occurred shortly after de Livet's own five year imprisonment in England. Rouen became the capital city of English power in occupied France and when the Duke of Bedford bought Joan of Arc her liberty from the Duke of Burgundy who had been keeping her in jail since May 1430, she was sent to be tried in the city during Christmas 1430. After a long trial by a church court, she was sentenced to be burned at the stake. The sentence was carried out on 30 May 1431 in the city, and most residents supported the Duke of Burgundy, Joan of Arc's royal enemy. In that same year, the young Henry VI was crowned King of England and France in Paris before coming to Rouen where he was acclaimed by the crowds. The king of France Charles VII recaptured the town in 1449, 18 years after the death of Joan of Arc and after 30 years of English occupation. The Renaissance Period The naval dockyards, where activity had been slowed by the 100 years war, became busy again as did the church of Saint-Maclou, which had been founded under English occupation The nave of the church of Saint Ouen was completed at last. The salle des pas- perdus (a sort of waiting room or ante-room) of the present law courts was built during this time. The whole building was built in a flamboyant style into which the first decorative elements typical of the Renaissance style right at the beginning of the 16th century had been incorporated. At that time Rouen was the fourth most populous city in the realm, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon. Rouen was also one of the Norman cradles of artistic Renaissance, in particular the one under the patronage of the archbishops and financiers of the town. The city's economic upturn at the end of the 15th century was mainly due to the emergence of the cloth industry, but also partly due to the development of the silk industry and metallurgy. The fishermen of Rouen went as far afield as the Baltic to fish for herrings. Salt was imported from Portugal and Guérande. Cloth was exported to Spain who also provided wool, and the Medici family made Rouen into the main port for the resale of Roman alum. At the beginning of the 16th century, Rouen became the main French port through which trade was conducted with Brazil, principally for the import of cloth dyes. By 1500, ten printing presses had been installed in the city following the installation of the first sixteen years earlier. The Wars of Religion In the years following 1531, part of the population of Rouen embraced Calvinism. The members of the Reformed Church represented a quarter to a third of the total population, a significant minority. In 1550, King Henry II staged a triumphant entry into Rouen, modeled on the ancient Roman triumph and specifically designed to ape Pompey's third triumph of 61 BC at Rome: \\"No less pleasing and delectable than the third triumph of Pompey... magnificent in riches and abounding in the spoils of foreign nations\\".Beard, 31. See 32, Fig. 7 for a contemporary depiction of Henri's \\"Romanised\\" procession. It was not enough, however, to long sustain royal authority in the city. From 1560 onwards, tensions rose between the Protestant and Catholic communities, and the Massacre of Vassy triggered the first of the French Wars of Religion. On 15 April 1562 the Protestants entered the town hall and ejected the King's personal representative. In May there was an outbreak of Iconoclasm (statue smashing). On 10 May the Catholic members of the town council fled Rouen. The Catholics in turn captured the Fort of Saint Catherine which overlooked the town. Both sides resorted to terror tactics. Overview of Rouen, 1572 At this juncture, the Protestant town authorities requested help from Queen Elizabeth I of England. In accordance with the Hampton Court Treaty which they had signed with Condé on 20 September 1562, the English sent troops to support the Protestants. On 26 October 1562 French Royalist troops retook Rouen and pillaged it for three days. The news of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day reached Rouen at the end of August 1572. Hennequier tried to avoid a massacre of the Protestants by shutting them up in various prisons. But between 17 and 20 September the crowds forced the gates of the prisons and murdered the Protestants that they found inside. The town was attacked on several occasions by Henry IV of France, but it resisted, notably during the siege of December 1591 to May 1592, with the help of the Spanish army led by the Duke of Parma (see Siege of Rouen (1591)). The Classical Age The permanent Exchequer of Normandy, which had been installed in Rouen in 1499 by George of Amboise, was transformed into a regional administrative assembly by Francis I in 1515 and up to the time of the Revolution was the administrative centre of the region. It had judicial, legislative and executive powers in Norman affairs and was only subordinate to the Privy Council. It also had power to govern French Canada. By the 1550s, Rouen reached a population of about 75,000 inhabitants and became the second largest city in France. During the early modern era, warfare was a common threat to the city of Rouen. There was military improvement in technology and organization; however, the siege of 1591–1592 concluded with high casualties. In the 16th century, The Protestant Reformation resulted in religious wars which caused a population decline in many areas of France. Until the 1750s a lot of cities, including Rouen, were in a stage of stagnation or decline of population. The 16th and 18th centuries brought prosperity to the city through the textile trade and the increased use of port facilities, as well as the development of public transportation and other industries. In 1703, the Norman Chamber of Commerce was formed. Rouen was well known for the production of wool and faience – glazed ceramic ware; wool was the main source of wealth for the city. The printing industry was introduced to Rouen in 1485 and influenced its cultural and economic development. Rouen became a regional centre of production by introducing a variety of books to the industry. Although it did not have a university, Rouen became an important intellectual centre by reason of its reputed schools of higher learning. In 1734, a school of surgery was founded (second only to that of Paris, founded in 1724). In 1758 a new hospital was opened, to the west of the town, which replaced the old medieval one which had become too small. 19th and 20th centuries During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, Rouen was occupied by the Prussians. During the First World War, the British used Rouen as a supply base and there were many military hospitals. Rouen was heavily damaged during World War II – approximately 45% of the city was destroyed. In June 1940, the area between the Rouen Cathedral and the Seine river burned for 48 hours as the Germans did not allow firemen access to the fire. Other areas were destroyed between March and August 1944, just before and during the Battle of Normandy, which ended on the left bank of the Seine with the destruction of several regiments belonging to the German 7th Army. Rouen's cathedral and several significant monuments were damaged by Allied bombing. During the German occupation, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine had its headquarters located in a château on what is now the Rouen Business School (École Supérieure de Commerce de Rouen). The city was liberated by the Canadians on 30 August 1944 after the breakout from Normandy.

Developed by Sculptured Software and published by Parker Brothers (the Game Boy version was published by Majesco Sales), this title was one of many inspired by the property. It is not to be confused with the 1993 Monopoly game, which was released in Japan only. Gameplay The game contains very similar gameplay to the board game it is based on, with various physical tasks being replaced by automation and digital representations. Critical reception Earl Green of AllGame deemed it \\"one of the better translations\\" of the Monopoly board game, due to it \\"captur[ing] the visual essence\\" of its source material. Just Games Retro argued that the game solved various problems of the board game, including it being too long, too fiddly, requiring a certain number of human players, and requiring the entire game to be finished in one sitting, noting that the gameplay is streamlined due to the digitisation of many aspects like banking. Pocket Magazine deemed it faithful to the original, while praising its gameplay, graphics, and sound, though noted the shortness of rounds. Sega-16 noted that it has the fun of Monopoly without the tedium of setting up and packing away the pieces. GameCola liked the game, though wished it had slightly better AI that could accommodate more players, and allowed for more customisation of gameplay. IGN wrote it was a good game for solitaire play, but not for multi- human play. Entertainment Weekly gave the game a C- and wrote that the computerized opponents took 10-15 seconds each to make their moves, and this made the game rather slow.

They organize national ID sports championships. The federation was recognized by law in 2010, and then became a member of the Cameroonian Paralympic Committee in 2011. FECASDI has tried to get its sportspeople qualified for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. They have also hosted several conferences.  Governance  Cameroonian Federation of Sports the Intellectually Disabled (FECASDI) is one of four member organizations of the Cameroonian Paralympic Committee. The organization's president is Jean Marie Aléokol. They are based in Yaoundé. The federation is in charge of appointing members to the national squad, representing Cameroon at International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability (INAS) sanctioned competitions. FECASDI organizes a national championship for ID sports. The championships include a number of sports including ID football, athletics and volleyball.

FECASDI and the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Deaf (FECASSO).The name of the organization in French is, '. These four organizations were then made members of the newly reformed Cameroonian Paralympic Committee. Cameroon was unable to send any ID athletes to an IPC sanctioned athletics competition in Manchester in March 2012. The inability to send sportspeople meant the country was unable to qualify any ID sports people for the 2012 Summer Paralympics because athletes could not get qualified. The national ID sports federation in Cameroon had to pay a penalty of €11,000 (around 7,150,00 XOF) for their non-participation. Lack of funding from the government was the primary reason why Cameroon's ID sportspeople could not go to Manchester competition, with the government unaware that FECASDI had even put in a request for funding. Federation representatives planned then to try to send their athletes to a competition later in the year in Portugal to try to get their athletes classified and eligible for London. The organization's Secretary General Emmanuel Wonyu expressed concern at that time that they might be suspended by INAS and wanted to avert that from happening. In 2013, FECASDI hosted a regional conference where issues about the development of ID sport in Africa were discussed. One of the major issues brought up by Aléokol and International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability (INAS) Executive Director Nick Parr was that there were no ID athletes from Africa who competed at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. In May 2014, the organization hosted an Agitos Foundation funded International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability (INAS) workshop that sought to increase participation of African countries in intellectual disability sports on the international level. Among the people presenting was New Zealand professor Jan Burns. The workshop provided an overview of INAS governed sports and INAS hosted competitions. Forty people from several countries including Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and Chad participated in the workshop, representing INAS members, Special Olympicsmembers, national sports federations and National Paralympic Committees. In April and May 2016, the organization hosted the 2016 INAS African Open International Futsal Tournament.

Description Like other vittarioids, the members of Haplopteris are epiphytes. The rhizome has a distinct upper and lower side, lacking radial symmetry, a characteristic that separates it from Radiovittaria. Leaves are borne in two ranks in a single plane, and are usually simple, occasionally forked. The leaves have a distinct costa (midrib). Most species have netlike leaf veins which form two rows of areolae (the \\"gaps\\" in the net) on either side of the midline; two species bear a single leaf vein only. The linear sori, in most species, are confined to a commissural vein (paralleling the edge of the leaf margin and set just back from it, joining the ends of the netted veins); in the two species with a single vein, the sori follow that vein. The sori bear paraphyses (minute hairs) with a cell at the tip shaped like an inverted cone, separating it from Vittaria sensu stricto, with slender paraphyses. Taxonomy The genus was first described by Carl Borivoj Presl in 1836, separating it from Pteris sensu Bory. He named it Haplopteris, from the Greek words for \\"simple\\" and \\"fern\\", in token of the simple fronds typical of the genus. He placed it in tribe Adiantaceae rather than Vittariaceae, although he recognized the similarity of the venation to Vittaria. Presl transferred Bory's Pteris scolopendrina to the genus as the type species. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the type species of Monogramma is embedded in Haplopteris. Since the name Monogramma has taxonomic priority over Haplopteris, a proposal to reject Monogramma in favor of Haplopteris has been put forth to conserve the name and comparatively stable circumscription of Haplopteris. Distribution About ten species are native to tropical Africa and the Indian Ocean, while the rest are found in tropical Asia and the Pacific. Species Schuettpelz et al. estimated the genus to contain about 40 species. The bulk of them were transferred out of Vittaria by Edmund H. Crane in 1998. 34 have currently been named: *Haplopteris alternans (Copel.)

It was established in 1938 as the Bagot Aboriginal Reserve, when the Aboriginal residents were moved from the Kahlin Compound, it was also sometimes referred to as the Bagot Road Aboriginal Reserve. In 1979 it became a self-governing community, administered by an Aboriginal Community Council and known as the Bagot Aboriginal Community, but signposted and commonly known as the Bagot Community. History left The Bagot Aboriginal Reserve was established in 1938 (probably under the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918, which allowed for Aboriginal reserves in the NT), when all Aboriginal residents were moved from the Kahlin Compound. The Retta Dixon Home was located at the reserve. The origins of the reserve's name has not been recorded by the Northern Territory Place Names Committee. In 1954, 22 boys from the reserve travelled to Toowoomba to perform a corroboree for Queen Elizabeth II. In the late 1970s the Reserve was handed over to Aboriginal custodians; thereafter it was known as the Bagot Aboriginal Community, but commonly referred to as the Bagot Community. Recent history left Bagot Community is run by the Bagot Community Incorporated (BCI). It faced financial difficulties in 2015 and was reportedly in administration with debts of more than $700,000. Commercial development of about of the Bagot Community site was then proposed. President of BCI Helen Fejo-Frith stated the development would \\"enable the Bagot Community to have a sustainable future\\". Poor housing, alcohol problems and violence were cited as major concerns by residents in the run-up to the 2013 Australian election. Although the permanently resident population is only about 250 people, during the wet season, this can grow to 500–700, leading to chronic overcrowding. In September 2013, moves to make Bagot into a suburb of Darwin were mooted, with the Northern Territory Government and the Larrakia Development Corporation (LDC) planning to turn Bagot into a normal suburb, embedded in Ludmilla. However Bagot Community Council said it would fight any attempts to hand over control to the LDC. For many years, the Larrakia were the predominant group at Bagot, but as of 2012, according to a paper by anthropologist Dr Bill Day, only two Larrakia families remained living permanently in the community. A community celebration known as \\"The Bagot Festival\\" was held as part of Darwin Festival in 2014, featuring music, dance and art. In 2015, a painting project was undertaken at the community which saw a series of murals painted on the houses. A project to upgrade much of the housing and infrastructure in Bagot was undertaken from 2018 to 2019 by the NT Government through its Town Camps Futures Unit.

He was born and lives in Vienna, where he has a private practice. Education and teaching positions Hermann Czech studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna and in the master classes of Ernst Plischke at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. In 1958 and 1959 he participated in the seminars of Konrad Wachsmann at the Summer Academy in Salzburg. From 1974 to 1980 he was an assistant to Hans Hollein and Johannes Spalt at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. He has been a guest professor at that university (1985/86) and a visiting professor at Harvard University (1988/89 and 1993/94), ETH Zurich (2004–07) and the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (2011–12). Work Czech has been influenced by the Viennese architects Adolf Loos and Josef Frank, and by the theoretical work of Konrad Wachsmann. His work is noted for a strong emphasis on context, a sophisticated and often ironic use of architectural elements, and an interest in rules and underlying order rather than sculptural form.

The clock tower was added in 1844 by the British. The History of Surat dates back hundreds of years.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Surat The city was founded in the late medieval period, and gradually became an important port in the Mughal Empire. The Maratha rulers defeated the Mughals during the Battle of Surat. Later, the Dutch ruled the area and the city became known as Dutch Suratte. Early history Surat in 1690 Surat was founded by Gopi, who named the area Surajpur or Suryapur. In the 12th and 15th centuries, Surat was plundered by Muslims. In 1512, and again in 1530, Surat was ravaged by the Portuguese Empire. In 1514, the Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa described Surat as an important seaport, frequented by many ships from Malabar and various parts of the world. By 1520, the name of the city had become Surat. In 1573, Surat was conquered by the Mughals. It was the most prosperous port in the Mughal empire, used for travel to the Hajj pilgrimage. Despite being a rich city, Surat looked like a typical \\"grubby\\" trader's town with mud-and-bamboo tenements and crooked streets, although along the riverfront there were a few mansions and warehouses belonging to local merchant princes and the establishments of Turkish, Armenian, English, French and Dutch traders. There were also hospitals for cows, horses, flies and insects run by religious Jains, which puzzled travelers. Some streets were narrow while others were of sufficient width. In the evening, especially near the Bazaar (marketplace), the streets became crowded with people and merchants (including Banyan merchants) selling their goods. Surat was a populous city during the Mughal era but also had a large transient population: during the monsoon season, when ships could come and go from the ports without danger, the city's population would swell. In 1612, England established its first Indian trading factory in Surat. The city was sacked twice by the Maratha king Shivaji, with the first sacking occurring in 1664. Shivaji's raids scared trade away and caused ruin to the city. Colonial period Surat in 1877 Dutch-Armenian Cemetery of Surat Later, Surat became the emporium of India, exporting gold and cloth. Its major industries were shipbuilding and textile manufacture. The coast of the Tapti River, from Athwalines to Dumas, was specially meant for shipbuilders, who were usually Rassis. The city continued to be prosperous until the rise of Bombay (present-day Mumbai). Afterwards, Surat's shipbuilding industry declined and Surat itself gradually declined throughout the 18th century. Between 1790–91, an epidemic killed 100,000 Gujaratis in Surat. The British and Dutch both claimed control of the city, but in 1800, the British took control of Surat. The Andrews Library was built during this period. In the great fire of 1837, more than 500 people died and caused the destruction of 9737 houses. It was the most destructive fire in the history of city. By the middle of the 19th century, Surat had become a stagnant city with about 80,000 inhabitants. When India's railways opened, the city started becoming prosperous again. Silks, cottons, brocades, and objects of gold and silver from Surat became famous and the ancient art of manufacturing fine muslin was revived.

V. Prasad. Produced by B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani Vijaya Vauhini Studios, the film's script was adapted by Chakrapani from two Bengali-language novels: Rabindranath Maitra's Manmoyee Girls School and Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay Detective. Missiamma also focused on social issues such as unemployment, corruption, and freedom of worship. Missiamma tells the story of two unemployed people of different religions and mentalities: Balu and Mary. They pose as a married couple to obtain jobs in a high school founded by Gopal, the zamindar of Aandipettai. As Balu and Mary fall in love, Gopal's nephew Raju (an amateur detective) learns that Mary is Gopal's missing elder daughter Mahalakshmi; she is unaware of her true identity. Production began in early 1954. The film was simultaneously shot in Telugu as Missamma, with an altered cast. Bhanumathi Ramakrishna was originally cast as the female lead, with Gemini Ganesan playing the male lead. After a dispute with Bhanumathi, Chakrapani replaced her with Savitri. K. A. Thangavelu, Jamuna, S. V. Ranga Rao, Rushyendramani, and K. Sarangkapani were cast in supporting roles while M. N. Nambiar was cast as the antagonist. C. P. Jambulingam and Kalyanam edited the film; Marcus Bartley was the cinematographer, and S. Rajeswara Rao composed the music. Principal photography took place in and around Madras (now Chennai) and wrapped in December 1954. Missiamma was released in theatres on 14 January 1955, two days after Missamma. Both versions were commercially successful, completing 100-day theatrical runs. The bilingual film brought recognition to its cast and studio. AVM Productions remade the film in Hindi as Miss Mary in 1957, with Ganesan reprising his role. Plot The Zamindar runs a school in the village Aandipettai. He wants to replace the existing teacher with someone with higher qualification. He decides to appoint a husband and wife couple as head master and wife. When he advertised in the papers, a Hindu young man who is looking for a job wants to apply for it. But he is not married. By circumstances he meets an unmarried young girl who is looking for a way to earn some money to set off a loan taken by her father. But she is a Christian. However, the young man and young woman come to an understanding and present themselves as husband and wife to the Zamindar. He appoints them as headmaster and teacher. The young woman also teaches music to the Zamindar's daughter. Zamindar and his wife lost their elder daughter 15 years ago in a temple festival. In fact, he named the school after the lost child, Mahalakshmi. Now the young woman teacher reminds them of their elder daughter and they shower love on her. A nephew of the Zamindar who is a self- styled detective, takes it upon himself to search and find the missing child. After some confusion and much banter, it comes to light that the young woman teacher is actually the lost child of the Zamindar. The family re-unites. The young man and the young woman who came pretending as husband and wife marries each other and become real couple at the end. Cast ;Male actors *Gemini Ganesan as Balu *K. A. Thangavelu as Raju *S.

Santhanam as Interviewer ;Female actors *Savithri as Mary and then Mahalakshmi *Jamuna as Sita *Rushyendramani as Zamindar's wife *Meenakshi as Mrs. Paul Production =Development= B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani signed L. V. Prasad to direct a bilingual film for Vijaya Vauhini Studios. The film's script, by Chakrapani, was based on two Bengali-language novels: Rabindranath Maitra's Manmoyee Girls School and Sharadindu Bandhopadhyay's Detective. Chakrapani thought the plot of Manmoyee Girls School, about two unemployed young people who pretend to be married to gain employment and fall in love, was too limited for a full-length film. He added the basic storyline of Detective, in which an enthusiastic detective finds a missing woman and marries her. Prasad's relationship with Khan, a Muslim tailor near Kohinoor Studios in Bombay (now Mumbai), was the basis of the film's friendship between two men of different religions. The film was titled Missamma in Telugu and Missiamma in Tamil. Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass wrote the dialogues for Missiamma. Marcus Bartley was signed as director of photography, and C. P. Jambulingam and G. Kalyanasundaram edited the film. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were its art directors. The film was processed at Vijaya Laboratory and recorded by Western Electric. M. S. Chalapathi Rao and Jagannadham were its executive producers. =Casting= Although Pathala Bhairavi (1951) and Pelli Chesi Choodu (1952) were the first bilingual films shot in Telugu and Tamil, the same actors were used in both versions. Missiamma was the first bilingual film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with different male actors. Bhanumathi Ramakrishna was cast as the female lead, and Gemini Ganesan (then known as R. Ganesh) was cast as the male lead in Missiamma, while N. T. Rama Rao played the same role in Missamma. S. V. Ranga Rao and Rushyendramani and Doraswamy and Meenakshi were cast as the title character's biological and foster parents, respectively, in both versions. Although all the actors in both versions used the same range of costumes, Ranga Rao wore a veshti for the Tamil version in accordance with Tamil custom. Prasad had completed four reels of film with Bhanumathi. She wrote to the producers, informing them that she would shoot only in the afternoon because Varalakshmi Vratam was being held at her home. The letter went astray and Chakrapani, a strict disciplinarian, chastised her for arriving late on set. When Bhanumathi refused to apologise, Chakrapani burnt the four reels in front of her and she quit the film. Although Nagi Reddy learned about the letter and tried to mediate, Chakrapani and Bhanumathi refused to reconcile. Chakrapani ordered Prasad to replace Bhanumathi with Savitri, who was initially cast as Sita. Jamuna was signed later for Sita's role, upon Savitri's recommendation. Savitri benefited the Tamil version by improving the on-screen chemistry with Ganesan; they had secretly married in 1952, before filming began. K. A. Thangavelu and K. Sarangkapani reprise the roles that Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah played in Telugu. M. N. Nambiar was cast as the antagonist. =Filming= Principal photography began in early 1954, with both versions (with different casts) filmed simultaneously. Photographs of Nagi Reddy's younger brother and cinematographer B. N. Konda Reddy's daughter (the latter as Gopalam's missing daughter) were used in the film. The scene where Ganesan's character persuades Savitri's character to pose as his wife was filmed at My Lady's Garden in Madras. For one sequence in his character jumps from a balcony, Ganesan refused a stunt double and performed the scene himself. He repeated this in Missamma, serving as Rama Rao's double. Filming was delayed because of Bhanumathi's exit and the difficulty of managing two casts simultaneously. Lasting for a year, it wrapped by the end of December 1954. After they saw the final edited version, Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani gave Dodge automobiles to the film's principal cast. Themes Missiamma deals with themes like unemployment and freedom of religion. In her 2002 book Cinema of Interruptions: Action Genres in Contemporary Indian Cinema, Lalitha Gopalan wrote that male protagonists in Indian films use the piano to express desire and cited Gemini Ganesan in Missiamma as an example. Pa Dheenadhayalan of Dinamani described Mary as the antithesis of Savitri's role in Devadasu (1953). Music The music was composed by S. Rajeswara Rao. The lyrics were penned by Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass. Raaga Sudharasa, a Thyagarajah Krithi in Andolika Raga, was also included in the film. The playback singers are A. M. Rajah, P. Leela and P. Susheela. \\"Ariya Paruvamada\\" was Susheela's first song for Rajeswara Rao. The song \\"Ennai Aalum Mary Maatha\\", picturised on Savitri's character, is an appeal to Virgin Mary. The song \\"Ariya Paruvamada\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Kharaharapriya, while \\"Brindavanamum Nandakumaranum\\" is set primarily in Shuddha Saveri, with parts of it in Abheri. Songs like \\"Vaarayo Vennilaave\\", \\"Brindavanamum Nandakumaranum\\", \\"Ennai Aalum Mary Maatha\\" and \\"Pazhaga Theriyavenum\\" became popular with the Tamil diaspora. The songs \\"Saami Dharmam Thalaikakkum\\" and \\"Sitaram Jai Sitaram\\" were performed by K. Sarangkapani onscreen; however, neither feature on the soundtrack. Release Missiamma was released in theatres on 14 January 1955, during Thai Pongal, and two days after Missamma. It was a commercially success, completing a 100-day theatrical run.  Reception  According to Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai's 2015 book Madras Studios, speculation about Savitri's real-life romance with Ganesan played a key role in the success of the film. A postage stamp commemorating Ganesan was introduced in Chennai in February 2006 by Dayanidhi Maran (the-then Minister of Communications and Information Technology) and Missiamma was shown for the occasion. The February 1955 issue of Kumudam called Missiamma \\"an interesting film with quality humor\\": \\"In the beginning one is uneasy as to how the love affair of a Christian heroine and a Hindu hero is going to be retooled for a comedy\\", but Prasad \\"has used every difficult situation as an opportunity for boundless humor\\". It praised the \\"moonlit sequence\\" and Bartley's cinematography, and the magazine Gundoosi described Savitiri's acting as \\"the best so far\\". In L.V. Prasad : a monograph (1993), film historian K. N. T. Sastry wrote: \\"lf cinema was to be considered a tool to forget our worries — here indeed was entertainment: Missiamma answered that definition.\\" In March 2005, film historian S. Theodore Baskaran commented on Ganesan's career best performances and found the one in Missiamma a \\"delightful\\" one; he added that the film was a \\"charming\\" one which provided breakthrough to Ganesan and Savitri in Tamil cinema. Remake Gemini Ganesan reprised his role in AVM Productions' Hindi remake of the film, Miss Mary, which marked his Bollywood debut. Legacy According to film historian Film News Anandan, Missiamma success inspired filmmakers to cast different actors for different versions of their films. On 23 January 1955, a 19-year-old woman gave birth to a baby in the Roxy Theatre in Madras while watching Missiamma. Mother and daughter were rushed to Egmore Maternity Hospital, where the baby was named Missiamma. Missiamma success made Ganesan adopt the screen name Gemini Ganesan to avoid confusion with Sivaji Ganesan, another popular actor in Tamil cinema. According to film historian Randor Guy, the success of Missiamma and other such romantic films earned Ganesan the tag \\"Kadhal Mannan\\" (King of Love). The film was a breakthrough in the careers of Savitri and Jamuna. Scenes from Missiamma were later featured in Kaadhal Mannan, a documentary on the life of Gemini Ganesan.

The site later became a Phoenician trading post. During the time of Emperor Augustus, Tamuda became part of Roman province Mauritania Tingitana.M. Tarradell, El poblamiento antiguo del Rio Martin, Tamuda, IV, 1957, p. 272 M. R. El Azifi, « L'habitat ancien de la vallée de Martil » in Revue de la Faculté des lettres de Tétouan, 1990, 4e année, n° 4, p. 65-81. In 1286, the Marinids built a casbah and mosque there. The first large scale building project took place in 1305 when the settlement was expanded by the Marinid king Abu Thabit Amir. The city was later rebuilt and fortified by Ali al-Mandri. Tetouan is a renowned multicultural center. The medina of Tetouan is a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1997. It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the area of Crafts and Folk Art since 2017. It is currently a city of 380,787, the 11th largest in Morocco and part of Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima administrative region.(Census 2014)  Phoenician and Roman presence  A few miles outside of the city limits lies the ancient town of Tamuda. Early settlements at the outskirts of the actual city by Mauretanian Berbers date back to the 3rd century BC. Artifacts from both the Phoenician and the Roman era have been found in the site of Tamuda. A type of seahorse with rider encountered on a clay disk, representing Punic iconography, was found at the site. It became a Roman colony under Emperor Augustus.  Rebuilding the city-state  A street in the old medina - Photograph by Swiss aviator and photographer 300x300px In 1286, the Marinids built a casbah and mosque there. The first large scale building project took place in 1305 when the settlement was expanded by the Marinid king Abu Thabit Amir.Ali ibn-abi-Zar' (1326) - Rawd Al-Kirtas (Histoire des souverains du Maghreb et annales de la ville de Fès. Traduction française Auguste Beaumier. Editions La Porte, Rabat, 1999, 325 p. He fortified the place and had it serve as a base for attacks on Ceuta, which had recently come under the rule of a rebellious member of the Marinid dynasty. In 1431, it was burned down and many were enslaved by the Castilians, because pirates used it as a base for their retaliatory attacks. The Portuguese were already occupying the neighboring Ceuta and in 1436, its commander Pedro de Menezes (Count of Vila Real) dispatched a detachment of his garrison under his son Duarte de Menezes to raid Tetouan -which was recovering from the Castillian destruction- in order to prevent it from becoming a threat to future Portuguese operations. But this did not seem to affect the strengthening of Tetouan's defenses. Tetouan would be rebuilt at the end of the 15th century, although there are different versions concerning the specific date. On one hand there is an ancient Arabic manuscript and on the other there is the account of 17th century Moroccan historian, Sidi al Arbi al Fasi. They offer mixed chronological data. According to the first of the aforementioned sources, the foundation had to take place between 1483 and 1484, while the second source sets the event, with extreme accuracy, on the 7th day of the Islamic month of Sha'ban of the Hijri year 898, a date that corresponds to Friday, May 24, 1493; a year after the surrender of Granada. This second chronology does not support the assertions of Leo Africanus, which states that \\"the ruins of Tetouan, deserted for ninety-five years, would be rebuilt and populated by the Granadine Al-Mandari, who presented himself to the Sultan of Fez after being expelled from Spain by Ferdinand II of Aragon.\\" However, due to certain events, such as the capture of the bride of Al-Mandari by the Count of Tendilla and his retention in the fortress of Alcalá la Real, it can be stated that prior to the last date mentioned, al-Mandari was already, duly fortified, in Tetouan. Tetouan \\"for many years ... laid in ruins ... was populated by Muslim refugees from the Kingdom of Granada, who fled the growing impetus of the Castilians.\\" By the end of the 15th century it was rebuilt by refugees from the Reconquista (reconquest of Spain, completed by the fall of Granada in 1492), when the Andalusian Moors first reared the walls and then filled the enclosure with houses. These Andalusians came into conflict with the Jebala Beni Hozmar tribe, after which they asked the Wattasid sultan for protection. In response, he sent 80 soldiers (according to one chronicle, 40 natives of Fez and 40 Rifians). In turn, the Andalusians paid a large amount of mithqal, thus insuring their autonomy. Instantly, the Andalusians, assisted by tribes from the surrounding mountains, started harassing the Spanish possessions on the Moroccan coast. These attacks led to the destruction of the city's harbor by the Spanish in 1565. During this time city was governed by the Andalusian Abu Hassan al-Mandri and the city remained autonomous from the Saadi sultans, with the Saadis constantly trying to assert their power.  Piracy and Mazmorras  200x200px This period can be understood within geopolitical and religious contexts. The Ottomans had just captured Constantinople in 1453 marking the end of the Byzantine Empire. The Portuguese started their colonial conquest by capturing some ports at the western coast of Morocco in 1487. A few years later, Granada was falling into the hands of the Catholic Monarchs (los Reyes Católicos) Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon and with that, forced conversions of Muslims in Spain followed. As early as the 1530s and 1540s, at the time when Spain and the Ottoman Empire were disputing control over the western part of the Mediterranean, piracy was spreading and soon Tetouan became one of the main centers of the piracy in the region. Corsairs considered it as a form of retaliation against the Spanish Reconquista that led to the loss of their homes back in al-Andalus especially that the timing coincided with the first Morisco influx to Tetouan due to the forced conversions they faced in Spain between 1501 and 1526. Their collaborators included English and Dutch renegades who were mostly Protestants although a few had converted to Islam. While the harbor served as a port from where piracy missions were launched, captives were taken to dungeons. They were underground prisoner complexes with a series of connected excavated caves called Mazmorras. The captives were faced with being sold to the slavery market if ransoms were not paid. These subterranean installations were rediscovered in the early 20th century. A chapel of a size of 90 square meters and a few altars were also uncovered. The sacred site, named Nuestra Señora de los Dolores (Our Lady of Sorrows), was used by the captives and redeemers like their relatives or Spanish Franciscans and Portuguese Jesuits who used to make frequent visits to negotiate the Christian captives' freedom. Miguel De Cervantes, himself a captive in Algiers, Algeria between 1575–80, refers to Mazmorras in El juez de los divorcios (The Divorce Judge) where the protagonist compares his marriage to \\"captivity in Tetouan's caves.\\" He also did it in Don Quixote, in addition to talking about Tetouan in El trato de Argel, La gran sultana and La ilustre fregona. It is believed that he had contact with some incarcerated who told him about the hardness of the dungeons of Tetouan. Diplomat and explorer Leo Africanus, while visiting the city, mentions in his book Description of Africa that there were 3.000 captives although some historians dispute that figure. Other accounts came from captives themselves such as Germain Moüette who spoke of horrible conditions lived inside those mazmorras in the late 17th century. Piracy continued and in 1829, the Austrian Empire bombarded the city as a reprisal. The underground prison was explored in 1922 by Cesar Luis de Montalban based on a report by archeologist Manuel Gómez-Moreno Martínez. The Spanish Protectorate administration then commissioned architect Carlos Ovilo to study the site but they found out that no excavation could be possible without taking the risk of damaging the housing above the site. Since then, no excavation was made although, recently, some researchers and civil associations are calling for the authorities to extend exploration and restoration before opening it to the public. Jewish Festival in Tetouan - Painting by French artist 300x300px  Jewish presence  Tetouan has been home to a significant Sephardi Jewish community which immigrated from Spain after the Reconquista and the Spanish Inquisition. This Jewish Sephardi community spoke a form of Judaeo-Spanish known as Haketia. In 1790, a pogrom happened, started by Sultan Yazid. The mellah was pillaged and many women raped.Norman A. Stilman (1979) The Jews of Arab Lands. A History and Source Book., 309;\\"On Saturday, the second of the above-mentioned month of Sha'ban, our Master al-Yazid--may God grant him victory--ordered the pillaging of the Mellah of Tetouan. They fell upon the Jews' women and took their virginity, and they did not leave a single one of them.\\" The Jews lived in a mellah, which is located inside the old medina. By 1860, there were a total of 16 synagogues in Tetouan although some accounts talk about 18. Following the exodus of Jews from Morocco after 1948, there are very few Jews left in Tetouan. By 1967, only 12 remained (López Álvarez, 2003). During that period, many emigrated to South America and much later to Israel, Spain, France and Canada. Today, the only synagogue remaining is that of Rabbi Isaac Bengualid which serves as a museum. The Paris-based international Jewish organization Alliance Israélite Universelle opened its first school in Tetouan in 1862. Jews of Tetouan have their own cemetery. It is more than 500 years old, with approximately 35,000 tombstones, making it the largest Jewish cemetery in Morocco.  Late military history  In the 17th century, the city was governed by the wealthy al-Naksis family. At the end of the century, the city was taken by the Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismail who encountered fierce resistance. Tetouan remained fragile, until it was taken by Ahmad al-Riffi, the Alaouite governor of Tangier and leader of the Berber army Jaysh al-Rifi that had conquered Tangier from the British. Al- Riffi ushered in a period of stability in Tetouan, building many of Tetouan's landmarks such as the Meshwar palace and the Pasha mosque, the oldest still standing mosque in Tetouan. After his death, the city again rebelled and was only nominally controlled by the central government. Elements of military constructions can be found in the original fortifications such as the three forts, the seven gates and the large outer walls that surround the old media. They have survived despite the changes that occurred through the expansions known to the city during multiple periods.  Hispano-Moroccan War and the Spanish Protectorate  The 300x300px In 1844, Morocco lost its war against the French and in 1856, it signed the \\"Anglo-Moroccan treaties of Friendship\\" with the British. The Spaniards saw the Moroccan defeat in 1844 and the 1856 treaties with the British as a sign of weakness. Spurred by a national passion for African conquest, the Spaniards declared war on Morocco in 1859 after a conflict over the borders of the Ceuta. After a few months, Tetouan was taken on 4 February 1860 under the command of General Leopoldo O'Donnell who was a descendant of an old Irish royal family, the O'Donnells of Tyrconnell. He was made hereditary Duque de Tetuán, and later served as Prime Minister of Spain. However, the Spanish evacuated in May 1862. In 1913, it became the capital of the Spanish protectorate of Morocco, which was governed by the Jalifa (Moroccan prince, serving as Viceroy for the Sultan), and the Spanish \\"Alto Comisario\\" accredited to him, and it remained its capital until 1956.  The nationalist movement  Tetouani women affiliated with 300x300px Tetouan was one of the most active Moroccan cities in resisting colonialism. The nationalist movement in Tetouan was led by the charismatic leader Abdelkhalek Torres and other personalities such as Abdessalam Bennuna and historian Mohammed Daoud. The movement was part of the pan-Arab nationalist movements. The movement established deep ties with Arab nationalist leaders such as former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Druze prince and intellectual Shakib Arslan. When Arsalan wanted to visit Morocco in August 1930 he was not given permit by the French protectorate but then went to Tangier, then having international status under foreign colonial powers, and from there to Tetouan where he met the group. Many of the members later joined the National Party for Istiqlal. Others joined some other nationalist parties and many members were women. Modern history Tetouan was further expanded when it became the capital of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco between 1913 and 1956. The Spanish administration built several new neighborhoods outside the walled medina. The city underwent an intense urban transformation for which its new neighborhoods and buildings, called \\"Ensanche\\" (meaning extension), acquired an image very similar to those of other Spanish cities of the time. Its structure was organized around a large circular plaza, now called 'Plaza Mulay el Mehdi' (formerly Plaza Primo de Rivera). The influence of the protectorate has remained important even after the independence of the country in 1956. In January 1984, and in the midst of the Years of Lead under the reign of late King Hassan II, a revolt spread into several cities for several days due to price hikes concerning basic goods following the implementation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Structural adjustment programme before it was thwarted by a military intervention. Twenty people were killed in Tetouan and many others were arrested and received heavy sentences. Many people in the city still speak Spanish. On road signs often names are written both in Spanish and in Arabic, though many signs are in Arabic and French, the second language of modern Morocco.

The interior design of the house was conceived by the painter and designer André Mare, in collaboration with Cubist artists from the Section d'Or group.Christopher Green, Art in France: 1900–1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, pp. 161-163, Yale University Press, 2000, 2003, Description Raymond Duchamp-Villon, original model of the architectural facade (destroyed) La Maison Cubiste had a 10 by 8 meter plaster facade with highly geometric trim, behind which were two furnished rooms; a living room (Salon Bourgeois) and a bedroom. Paintings by Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Marie Laurencin, Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Léger and Roger de La Fresnaye were hung in the salon.André Mare, Salon Bourgeois, Salon d'Automne, The Literary Digest, Doom of the Antique, New York City, November 30, 1912, p. 1012Ben Davis, \\"Cubism\\" at the Met: Modern Art That Looks Tragically Antique, Exhibition: \\"Cubism: The Leonard A. Lauder Collection\\", Metropolitan Museum of Art, ArtNet News, 6 November 2014 Thousands of spectators at the salon passed through the full-scale model.La Maison Cubiste, 1912 Decoration While the facade and paintings in the installation were inspired by cubism, the decoration of the interior, by André Mare, was also one of the first important examples of Art Deco. Mare, a painter, worked with a group of artists to design the wallpaper, upholstery, cushions, carpets and other decoration of the rooms. The decoration featured bright colors and floral patterns, particularly stylized garlands and bouquets of roses, which became one of the major themes of early Art Deco. The fame of the Maison Cubiste launched the career of Mare; after the First World War, he co-founded a design company, the Compagnie des arts Francais, with Louis Suë. He designed two major pavilions and the main entrance of the 1925 Exposition des Arts Decoratifs, which gave Art Deco its name, and later designed the interiors of famous French transatlantic ocean liners, including the SS Île de France. Legacy It was an early example of art décoratif, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Cubism was recognized as significant to a broad range of applications, beyond the bounds of fine art. The movement opened the way toward new possibilities, a modern geometrical vision that could be adapted to architecture, interior design, graphic arts, fashion and industrial design; the basis of Art Deco. Le Salon Bourgeois, designed by André Mare inside La Maison Cubiste, in the decorative arts section of the Salon d'Automne, 1912, Paris. Metzinger's Femme à l'Éventail on the left wall Mare called the living room in which Cubist paintings were hung the Salon Bourgeois. Léger described this name as 'perfect'. In a letter to Mare prior to the exhibition Léger writes: \\"Your idea is absolutely splendid for us, really splendid. People will see Cubism in its domestic setting, which is very important.\\" The facade of the house (Façade architecturale), designed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, was not very radical by modern standards; the lintels and pediments had prismatic shapes, but otherwise the facade resembled an ordinary house of the period. The rooms were furnished in a bourgeois, colorful, and rather traditional manner, particularly compared with the paintings. The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine Art et Décoration: \\"He does not embarrass himself with simplicity, for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of picturesqueness and gaiety. He achieves it.\\" The Cubist element was provided by the paintings. Despite its tameness, the installation was attacked by some critics as extremely radical, which helped make for its success. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston.Kubistische werken op de Armory ShowRaymond Duchamp-Villon, listed in catalog of the New York Armory Show exhibit as number 609, Facade architectural, plaster, 1913, unidentified photographer.

Decorative work was called the \\"antithesis of the picture\\". \\"The true picture\\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, \\"bears its raison d'être within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...\\" \\"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence\\", wrote Christopher Green, \\"creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye\\". For the occasion, an article entitled Au Salon d'Automne \\"Les Indépendants\\" was published in the French newspaper Excelsior, 2 Octobre 1912.Salon d'Automne 1912, page from Excelsior reproduced Excelsior was the first publication to privilege photographic illustrations in the treatment of news media; shooting photographs and publishing images in order to tell news stories. As such L'Excelsior was a pioneer of photojournalism. Walter Pach, president of the landmark 1913 exhibition known as the Armory Show, wrote a pamphlet for the occasion, \\"A Sculptor’s Architecture\\", in which he discussed Duchamp–Villon’s La Maison Cubiste as exemplary of a new architectural style for the modern era.Walter Pach, A sculptor's architecture, 1913, Published by the Association of American Painters and Sculptors. Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, 1859-1984, bulk 1900-1949. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution \\"[T]his work of M. Duchamp-Villon's is an example of what possibilities are contained in a style like the present one whose philosophy is a base\\", writes Pach, \\"not a limitation.\\" Continuing, Pach writes, \\"His work in architecture is by no means a turning aside from his sculpture, but a furthering of it. In the present facade he has simply a \\"subject\\" whose organization was to be developed from the forms suggested by a man or woman.\\" When the art collector Michael Stein, brother of Gertrude Stein, first introduced the work of Duchamp-Villon to Pach, he noted that it would be \\"admirably suited to the needs of building with concrete\\". Pach agreed. But speaking with the sculptor convinced Pach that this style had its first application to building with stone, and that it emerged from \\"an appreciation and solution of the new problem of steel and stone.\\" > The final word I would speak about this architecture is its quality of > response to the needs of America. We have yet enormous areas that will be > built up into cities, we are going to tear down and rebuild most of the > edifices, that already exist. With the freedom that this order gives to > individual development and with its possibilities of expansion to make it > suit the largest building as well as the smallest, it seems to clearly fix > the type of our ideal. Before a photograph of the sky-scrapers of Manhattan > Island, Raymond Duchamp-Villon said that he saw the possibilities of the > modern cathedral.

Chochol was one of three Czech architects (members of the Mánes Union of Fine Arts), with Pavel Janák and Josef Gočár, influenced by Cubism It is difficult to measure the influence of the Maison Cubiste. No actual house following the same design was ever built, and later Deco and modernist residences followed very different models. However, the house was a great success in emphasizing the role of Cubism as an alternative to traditional art and design. The scandal in the press caused by the paintings displayed there was a major contributor to the popularity of Cubist art. Thanks largely to the popularity of the exposition, the term \\"Cubist\\" began to be applied to anything modern, from women's haircuts to clothing to theater performances. Fara House in Pelhřimov, Czech Republic, with a baroque facade rebuilt by Pavel Janák in the Cubist House style (1913) Le Corbusier had reportedly been enthused by La Maison Cubiste during the 1912 exhibition. \\"He saw in it important solutions for the problem of building with cement.\\" Le Corbusier subsequently exhibited his model for Maison Citrohan (a mass production prototype) at the Salon d'Automne of 1922.Alice T. Friedman, Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History, p. 110, Yale University Press, 2006, He later built the Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau for the L'Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes, 1925, Paris, the event which gave Art Deco its name.Bevis Hillier, Art Deco of the 20s and 30s (Studio Vista/Dutton Picturebacks), 1968 The undecorated rectangular box of the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, however, bore no resemblance to the Cubist House. No buildings like the Cubist House were built in France, but the model did have an impact in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where architects wanted to show their independence from the Viennese style. In 1913 the Czech architect Pavel Janák was commissioned to reconstruct the facade of a large baroque house, the Fara House in the town of Pelhrimov in south Bohemia, in the cubist style. Janák redid the baroque facade by adding angular geometric forms similar to those on the model of the cubist house in Paris. Because of this quest for architectural independence from Austria, many art deco houses, mostly in the later more typical Deco style, are found in Prague and other cities in the Czech Republic.

He is a fast bowler who has played for Australia's national youth team, and has played first-class and List A cricket for South Australia and Twenty20s for the Adelaide Strikers. Agar spent his childhood in Victoria but moved to South Australia to seek more opportunities. He represented the state at under-19 level and was named in Australia's national under-19 squad for the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup before Australia pulled out of the tournament. He had a rookie contract with South Australia and played his first matches at state level in the 2016–17 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, after which he also signed with the Adelaide Strikers to play in the Big Bash League. In 2017 he was not given another contract with South Australia and returned to Victoria. Cricket career =Early career= Agar was born into a cricketing family. His father, John, was a fast bowler, and he was born the youngest of three brothers. His oldest brother, Ashton, has played Test cricket for Australia as a spin bowler and his other brother Will is a left-handed batsman who plays grade cricket. Agar chose to follow in his father's footsteps and became a fast bowler. Agar played Victorian Premier Cricket for the Monash Tigers, also known as the Richmond Cricket Club, making his first XI debut for the club at the age of sixteen. Double stress fractures in his back interrupted his 2014–15 season, but he was still able to win a premiership with the Tigers' second XI. During this stage of his career he did not have the pace in his bowling or the physical build to reach higher success. =Move to South Australia (2015–2017)= Agar moved to South Australia in 2015 to seek out more opportunities. He joined Adelaide University's grade cricket team for the 2015–16 season. He had only $500 to his name and had to work part-time on a dairy farm to earn enough money to stay in Adelaide. Despite still being only a teenager, he rose to prominence, increasing his bowling speed to as high as 130 km/h. This made him the second fastest uncontracted bowler in South Australia at the time. Agar was selected to play for South Australia in the under-19 national championships and took ten wickets at an average of 22.60, including an impressive 5/37 against Tasmania. His form through the tournament meant that in December 2015 he was named in Australia's squad for the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Australia later pulled out of the world cup, but Agar had played three matches while in the squad in the United Arab Emirates. Agar's form in the 2015–16 season brought him to the attention of both national and state selectors. During the 2016 winter he was included in the 17-man National Performance Squad to train for two months at Australia's Centre of Excellence, and he was also given a rookie contract with South Australia's state team. His first appearance for South Australia came in the 2016–17 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, when he made his List A debut on 2 October 2016. During the tournament he took eight wickets in five matches, his consistent form earning him a contract with Big Bash League franchise the Adelaide Strikers. He made his Twenty20 debut for the Strikers in the 2016–17 Big Bash League season on 10 January 2017. =Return to Victoria (2017–2019)= At the end of the 2016-17 season Agar did not sign another contract with South Australia, and instead decided to return to Victoria to try to win a contract with the Bushrangers. Despite this move, he remained with the Adelaide Srikers for BBL07, but wasn't a regular member of the Strikers' team. He played his only match of the tournament against the Perth Scorchers, who his brother Ashton was playing for. This was the first time they had played against each other in a cricket match. Wes bowled two balls to Ashton, who hit them for two runs. =Return to South Australia (2019–present)= Agar returned to South Australia in mid-2019 and made his first-class debut on 18 October 2019, for South Australia in the 2019–20 Sheffield Shield season. In consecutive List A matches for South Australia in late 2019 he took 5 for 69 against Queensland and 5 for 40 against Western Australia. He continued to impress for South Australia throughout the Sheffield Shield, ending the season with 33 wickets in eight matches at 24.21, the most of anyone from South Australia and equal-second most in the competition. Agar also translated this form to the Big Bash League, taking 17 wickets in 12 matches for the Strikers. His impressive domestic season across all formats saw him named the 2020 Bradman Young Cricketer Of The Year. Player profile Agar is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He has focused on bowling quickly, bowling at speeds of up to 130 km/h when he was still a teenager. By 2017 he was aiming to bowl consistently at 140 km/h, a feat that most bowlers can't achieve. He is also a useful batsman, and Troy Cooley, the coach at the Centre of Excellence, has said that his older brother Ashton adopted his batting approach to improve his own batting.

It was located on the Bagot Aboriginal Reserve. History The Retta Dixon Home was established in 1946 by the Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM). In 1941 an AIM representative was invited to Bagot Aboriginal Reserve to take charge of 'part-coloured' or 'half-caste' Aboriginal women and children. With the outbreak of World War II the then superintendent, Miss Shankelton, evacuated 72 children to Balaklava in South Australia in 1942. Upon returning to Darwin in 1946, the AIM set up the Retta Dixon Home as an institution to provide care for these children. The Retta Dixon Home was destroyed by Cyclone Tracy and is now a vacant block. A memorial plaque marks the location where the home once stood. It reads: > This plaque is in recognition of Aboriginal children displaced from mother > and country. Karu Park accommodated a children's institution named Retta > Dixon Home. Similar institutions were established at Kahlin, Garden Point, > Croker island and Groote Eylandt. This plaque is dedicated to the memory of > those children and their mission workers. Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse Allegations of child sexual abuse at the Retta Dixon Home were investigated at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in 2015. Ten former residents gave evidence, describing their experiences of rape, molestation and abuse at the home. The findings released on 19 August 2015, found that AIM \\"did not meet the obligations that it had to children in its care, including protection from sexual abuse\\". The Commissioners found that AIM did not provide sufficient training to its staff on how to detect or respond to allegations of child sexual abuse. As a result of an out-of-court settlement, 71 people were awarded compensation.

This earned him his first SACA contract, officially joining the South Australian squad for the 2015–16 season. He played three Sheffield Shield matches in the 2015–16 season, across which he took six wickets, and the highlight of his season came in a match against Western Australia.

It is the earliest known sedentary culture in Bolivia, as after circa 1200 BCE camelid hunters of the altiplano became camelid herders and sedentary lifestyle developed. The Wankarani culture was little researched before 1970, when Carlos Ponce Sanginés defined all the mound sites in the area as belonging to one culture that predated Tiwanaku and was contemporary with the Chiripa culture.Time and Process in an Early Village Settlement System on the Bolivian Southern Altiplano  Description  Wankarani villages typically consisted of fifteen to five hundred houses. Over the centuries, remains of the adobe bricks and trash created small mounds, on which new houses were built. The dead were buried under the floor of the huts. Wankarani houses were small, round adobe huts painted red on the outside and yellow on the inside. Some villages had up to 4000 inhabitants, but the majority of villages had less than hundred people. A site near the Chuquiña village has been considered as one of the largest Wankarani villages. Some of the settlement mounds grew to in height and indicate that village life changed very little during this time, as Wankarani society did not advance into larger chiefdoms or a small state, yet formed independent village communities. The usual location of villages at the base of the hills, absence of village walls and minimal remains of weapons suggest that it was a peaceful society. Wankarani economy was based on herding llamas and alpacas, cultivation of potatoes, quinoa and qañiwa. The harsh climate and low rainfall meant that Wankarani economy remained at subsistence levels of natural farming and small regional trade. Copper smelting was known to Wankarani as remains of smelters have been found. Artisans also made small stone heads sculpted after the llamas and alpacas. Wankarani pottery was undecorated, making it hard to understand the visual style of this culture. Wankarani culture ended as it was incorporated into the growing and expanding Tiwanaku empire. Contemporary cultures In northern Chile and neighbouring areas of Peru and Bolivia, early ceramics started to appear during the 'Faldas del Morro' and subsequent 'Alto Ramírez' cultural phases, which are roughly contemporary with Wankarani culture. The Alto Ramírez phase dates to 1000 BCE-400 CE. > The Alto Ramirez phase seems to have been contemporaneous with Pukara and > other Lake Titicaca Basin societies of the andean Early Intermediate Period, > such as Qaluyu, Chiripa, Pukara, Wankarani and Early Tiwanaku.

It began on November 19, 2001 when members of a faction of the MNLF loyal to Misuari attacked a Philippine Army headquarters in Jolo, Sulu in the Philippines. The attack was meant to disrupt the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao elections scheduled for November 26 of that year, which eventually replaced Misuari as governor. Background In 1996, Nur Misuari signed a peace agreement with the Philippine government that led to the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); Misuari eventually became its first governor. In April 2000, Misuari was ousted as MNLF chair by his colleagues, who cited his incompetent performance as ARMM governor. He was replaced by the \\"Committee of Fifteen\\", which is the central leadership of the MNLF. Then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo also cited Php 43 billion worth of funds for the ARMM that remained unaccounted for. Arroyo then chose Dr. Parouk Hussin, a member of the \\"Committee of Fifteen\\", as the administration's candidate as ARMM governor. Hussin eventually won the post and stated that he would focus on an audit of the region's fiscal and property resources. Apparently offended by his ouster from the MNLF leadership, as well as losing the ARMM governor's post and facing a fiscal audit for missing public funds, Misuari declared war on the Arroyo government on November 19, 2001. The rebellion The Philippine government stated that Misuari then launched an armed rebellion on the island of Jolo to undermine elections for his position as ARMM governor. MNLF members loyal to Misuari began attacking Philippine Army outposts; the hostilities caused a hundred fatalities, most of whom were Misuari's men. Many were wounded, including civilians. In Zamboanga City, 300 MNLF men led by Julhambri Misuari, Nur Misuari's nephew, took over the Cabatangan government complex and held the residents of the neighborhood hostage, marching them around the city roped together, until they were allowed to leave unmolested by government forces which had ringed the city outskirts. Aftermath The Philippine government filed rebellion charges against Nur Misuari in a Sulu court. Misuari initially escaped the military dragnet; there were reports that he had sought refuge in Sabah, Malaysia. Other reports stated that the Abu Sayyaf was hiding him in Jolo. Misuari was captured by Royal Malaysia Police forces a few days after the fighting and extradited back to the Philippines. He was charged with rebellion but was eventually released. In 2008, the rebellion charges against him were dropped. Five years later, an armed incursion into Zamboanga City by forces loyal to Nur Misuari led to the 2013 Zamboanga City crisis.

In November 2003, Cotan took up a post as Ambassador of Indonesia to Australia. Speaking about on his time in Australia at the end of the posting in 2005, Cotan reflected that the relationship was difficult when he first came to Canberra in 2003 because of events that happened in East Timor in 1999. Cotan said the aid and relief Australia's military had provided to Indonesia in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami had brought the two countries closer. He said however that he was stunned at the way Australians reacted to the arrest and sentencing of Schapelle Corby for drug smuggling in 2004–05—some Australians wanted the country's tsunami aid taken into account in Corby's sentencing. Cotan was appointed Ambassador of Indonesia to China in 2010. In an interview in 2011, Cotan said he was proud to see the relationship between the two countries reach its highest point ever. While he was ambassador, the Indonesian Government opened a consulate general in Shanghai, which was expected to enhance the ties between the two nations.

It took responsibility for many of the units of the former 182nd Reserve Division and was expanded with various fortress and training troops stationed at Luxembourg, Saarburg and Metz. After D-Day it was designated as a Volksgrenadier division and reorganised for combat and was dispatched to the frontlines in August 1944. At the start of November 1944, now commanded by Generalleutnant Vollrath Lübbe, the division, less the 1216th Grenadier Regiment which had been transferred to the 19th Volksgrenadier Division, was defending the town of Metz from the United States Third Army. At this stage of the war, the division numbered 7,000 personnel. It surrendered the town on 28 November, having lost two commanders during the siege; Lübbe had suffered a stroke and his replacement, Generalmajor Heinrich Kittel, was wounded in action on 22 November.

They were initiated by king Carlos IV, who suggested that the succession law in force be altered; the change would consist of giving preference to females of main descendant line over males of collateral lines. The proposal was accepted and formally adopted as Cortes’ petition to the king, but a corresponding law was not published until 1830, which triggered a dynastical conflict and a series of civil wars. The question whether the succession law was effectively changed in 1789 turned into a heated juridical, historical and political debate and continued well into the 20th century. In current historiography it is usually considered of secondary importance and dealt with in highly ambiguous terms. Background Carlos IV Carlos IV assumed the throne of Spain in December 1788 according to standard succession rules. In May 1789, he issued circular letters which convened the Cortes; the single declared purpose was to take the oath of allegiance to the heir to the throne, Prince Fernando, at the time 5 years old and the older one of two living sons of Carlos IV. The procedure was completely routine. The absolutist Borbonic rule even stripped Cortes of its fiscal prerogatives, and the formality of taking oath to the heir was the key reason why the diet used to meet few times across the 18th century.throughout the 18th century Cortes was convened 6 or 10 times, counting depends upon whether one counts full-size of limited-size gatherings, Rosario Prieto, Las Cortes de 1789: el orden sucesorio, [in:] Vicente Palacio Atard, Manuel Espadas Burgos (eds.), Estudios sobre el siglo XVIII, Madrid 1978, p. 266. However, the circulars enjoined also to see that the deputies, at that time called procuradores, were to be provided with sufficient powers to discuss and conclude unspecified other matters in case they should be proposed.there are numerous works which quote in extenso the documents referred to, see e.g. Placido Maria de Montoliu y de Sarriera, ¿Don Alfonso ó Don Carlos? estudio histórico-legal, Madrid 1872. The most complete English-language set of translations is in William Walton, Spain! Or, Who is the Lawful Successor to the Throne?, London 1834, p. 12. Some scholars note that when issuing the circular letters, particular attention was paid to the deputies being equipped in all powers, Prieto 1978, p. 295.

Those deputies started to arrive in Madrid in the summer, but the diet formally met for the first time on September 19, 1789. The deputies were addressed by the king, who confirmed principal objective of the convocation, adding also that they would \\"treat and conclude other matters\\".Prieto 1978, p. 294. Once the king had withdrawn, the president of the Cortes, Count of Campomanes, informed the gathering that the Cortes would remain open also after the ceremony of taking oath; the purpose was specified vaguely as \\"to take measures respecting the Law of Succession\\".Walton 1834, p. 14. The procuradores gathered again on September 23, when the pompous and solemn ceremony of swearing allegiance to prince Fernando took place as planned in the church of San Gerónimo in Madrid. Another week passed on as deputies were attending various religious or royal feasts without the Cortes having been convened.Prieto 1978, p. 302. However, at least once, on September 28, the king met with Campomanes and Count of Floridablanca, head of Junta Suprema de Estado and effectively the prime minister of Spain. The three discussed disturbing news about ongoing events in France, but they also pondered planned changes to the law of succession, apparently the issue which had already been discussed earlier. The king, the prime minister and the Cortes president decided to launch the procedure of altering the succession regulations at the first Cortes session; they agreed also that it must be kept secret.Prieto 1979, pp. 328-329. September 30, 1789: succession law proceeded Buen Retiro palace The deputies formally met again in Sala de los Reinos of the Buen Retiro palace on September 30, either early or late morning.earlier historiographical works suggested that the deputies gathered around 11 AM, Longares Alonso p. 115, claims they met around 8 AM. With one minor exception which did not affect legality of the proceedings, almost all deputies entitled were present.the one missing was a deputy from Teruel, who felt unwell, Antonio Aparisi Guijarro, La cuestión dinastica, Madrid 1869, p. 47. The president informed the gathering that the king expected them to take a strict oath of secrecy before the proceedings should start. The text, apparently pre-prepared, was read by the president; it specified that all the convened would never disclose anything to be discussed unless permitted by the king or by the president. The deputies acknowledged it with the collegial \\"amen\\".Walton 1834, p. 15. None of the sources consulted specifies whether the secret mode of proceeding was exceptional, unusual or customary in the Cortes of that time. Afterwards the president read to the chamber a text of royal proposal; its essence was that the 1713 succession regulations, which barred females from inheriting the throne save for extraordinary circumstances, be replaced with original Spanish medieval rules, which in terms of succession did not distinguish between sexes. The text noted that the 1713 rules had been born out of circumstances which no longer existed, that they were incompatible with traditional Spanish customs, and that they had resulted in numerous conflicts, having been a threat to peace.Walton 1834, p. 16, Montoliu Sarriera 1872, pp. 97-98. The proposal was then followed by reading out a pre-prepared draft of a petition, to be adopted by the Cortes and directed to the king.it is believed that it had been drafted by Count of Floridablanca, Jesús Longares Alonso, Las últimas Cortes del Antiguo Régimen en España (19 septiembre - 5 diciembre de 1789), [in:] Estudis: Revista de historia moderna 3 (1974), p. 159. Its 2-paragraph text was relatively brief; it proposed that the king orders publication of a law which ordains that \\"Law 2, Title 15, Partida 2\\" is observed notwithstanding the changes introduced in later \\"Law 5, Title 7, Book 5\\".full text in Montoliu Sarriera 1872, p. 99. The former, known as Ley de Partida, was the succession law of medieval statutory code; the latter was the 1713 regulation which established new succession rules upon Borbonic assumption of the Spanish throne, usually referred to as \\"Semi-salic law\\" or \\"Salic law\\". There is no information available whether the proposal of such a fundamental change came as a shock to the deputies, whether it merely surprised them, or whether it was anticipated and caused no excitement at all.Prieto 1978, p. 320. The only record available states that the next to speak was Marqués de Villacampo, as the Burgos deputy traditionally speaking for the chamber; in name of the house he expressed concurrence.Walton 1834, p. XI. The petition was then signed by all deputies and placed in the hands of Campomanes for further proceedings.Walton 1834, p. 17. The gathering briefly discussed a number of other minor unrelated issues, and around 12 AM the session was closed. According to the present-day historian the debate on succession was \\"a matter of minutes\\".Longares Alonso 1974, p. 159. October 1789: further proceedings Conde de Campomanes The Cortes met again on October 3, 1789, when the record of September 30 proceedings was read and agreed to; there is no information of any discussion or difference of opinions having taken place.Montoliu Sarriera 1872, p. 43. Four days later, on October 7, 1789, the Cortes petition was inspected by the Catholic hierarchs, gathered earlier to assist in the ceremony of taking oath.none of the sources consulted clarifies whether in terms of legislative routine this was a routine or extraordinary step. In presence of Conde de Floridablanca, 14 bishops and archbishops acknowledged the proposal with their own document, which fully endorsed the changes suggested and recommended that \\"original and natural order is re-established\\".\\"restituir las cosas a su primitivo ser natural\\", Montoliu Sarriera 1872, p. 101-103, Prieto 1978, p. 325. At an unspecified time in October the petition was also reviewed on one or few meetings of a body named Junta de Asistentes de Cortes, serving as a board providing non- binding legal opinion.The Junta was composed of the Cortes president and 4 members of Council of Castile. In a separate address to the king, dated October 30, 1789, the Junta also fully endorsed the Cortes proposal.full text Montoliu Sarriera 1872, p. 100. At an unspecified time the address was acknowledged with written royal assent, also dated October 30, declaring \\"resolution corresponding to the accompanying petition\\" and enjoining that greatest secrecy be observed.Walton 1834, p. XII. In one modern Castellano version the text reads \\"He tomado la resolucion conforme con la peticion adjunta, y encomiendo que se guarde provisionalmente el mayor secreto porque asi conviene mi servicio\\", quoted after Montoliu Sarriera 1872, p. 43-4, slightly different version is \\"He tomado la resolucion correspondiente á la súplica que acompaña, encargando por ahora el mayor secreto, por convenir así á mi servicio\\", Aparisi 1869, p. 50. Following the October 3 session the diet met on 5 other days, always discussing issues unrelated to the succession question: the agenda was almost entirely about agrarian regime, principally about huge landholdings named mayorazgos, their fiscal obligations and hereditary rules.Longares Alonso 1974, pp. 117-138, 155-158. Some authors claim that as the news of the events unfolding in Paris arrived in Madrid, fearing unrest Campomanes dissolved the Cortes on October 17, which would have ended abruptly.Enrique Martínez Ruiz, La España moderna, Madrid 1992, , p. 561. Authors of detailed studies claim that the Cortes proceedings went on as planned. On October 31, 1789 the chamber met again; during the sitting the president informed the deputies that the king answered all petitions delivered. As to the succession issue, the procuradores were informed that the original petition had been appended with the royal resolution, stating that \\"I will ordain those of my Council to issue the Pragmatic Sanction which in such cases is expedient and customary, bearing in mind your petition and the opinions thereof taken\\".Walton 1834, p. XIII. In Spanish \\"Habiendo tenido en consideracion vuestra peticion y los pareceres tomados en este negocio, respondo que mandaré á los miembros de mi Consejo experid la pragmática- sancion de derecho y constumbre en tales casos\\", referred after Montoliu Sarriera 1872, p. 44, or \\"A esto os respondo: que ordenaré a los del mi Consejo expedir la Pragmática-sancion que en tales casos corresponde y se acostumbra, teniendo presente vuestra súplica y los dictamenes que sobre ella haya tomado\\", Aparisi 1869, p. 50. See also Testimonio de las actas de Córtes de 1789 sobre la sucesión en la Corona, Madrid 1833, p. 22. During the same meeting of October 31 the deputies once again acknowledged the king's special injunction, pledged to observe it, and formally renewed their oath of secrecy. The written record of the session notes also that they expressed the wish that the succession law be secured in substance and in manner \\"until the publication of the Pragmática took place, at such time as H. M. might think proper\\".Walton 1834, p. XIII. The same day Campomanes announced the king's intention to close the Cortes on November 5. The meeting was terminated and the deputies re-convened as planned 6 days later, when in presence of the king the Cortes was formally dissolved as \\"having met its objectives\\".The information widely provided by older works, compare e.g. Pedro Sabau y Larroya, Ilustración de la ley fundamental de España: que establece la forma de suceder en la corona y exposición del derecho de las augustas hijas del Señor Don Fernando VII, Madrid 1833, p. 70, though also by present-day scholars, compare Longares Alosno 1974, p. 117. The title of his work, Las últimas Cortes del Antiguo Régimen en España (19 septiembre - 5 diciembre de 1789), appears to contain a curious error. Afterwards Fernando VII Routine legislative procedure envisioned that once a law is approved, it is made public by printing out an appropriate document; however, no law on changing succession rules was published, be it as Ley Fundamental, Pragmática Sanción, Auto Acordado or in any other format. The periodical re-edition of an updated set of key legislation, published in 1805, known as Novisima Recopilación and confirmed by Carlos IV, in terms of succession to the throne referred to the 1713 rule and contained no information on any alteration. Upon abdication of Carlos IV in 1808 the throne was assumed by his son, Fernando VII; as he had no issue no ceremony similar to the 1789 taking of oath took place. The revolutionary Constitution of Cádiz, issued in 1812, did not distinguish between sexes in terms of royal hereditary rights;Capitulo II, articulo 176 of the 1812 constitution read: \\"En el mismo grado y línea los varones prefieren a las hembras y siempre el mayor al menor; pero las hembras de mejor línea o de mejor grado en la misma línea prefieren a los varones de línea o grado posterior'. it contained no official reference to the 1789 Cortes, though Junta Suprema of the Cádiz gathering was aware of its proceedings.Prieto 1978, pp. 339-340. Once Fernando VII returned to power in 1813 the pre-revolutionary status quo ante was restored, though with no specific reference to succession law. The deposed Carlos IV died in 1819. As Fernando VII turned 40 and still had no issue, in the 1820s it was widely understood that in case he dies with no son, the throne would pass to his younger brother, Don Carlos. There were no participants of the 1789 Cortes alive when on March 29, 1830,the document was signed March 29 and published March 31, 1830. Fernando VII issued a document styled as publication of the 1789 succession law. The 1830 document briefly referred the events of 1789 and noted that turbulent times did not allow \\"execution of those important designs\\";in original \\"ejecución de estos importantes designios\\". it also claimed that with peace and tranquility fully restored, the \\"Pragmática-sanción\\" of 1789 is now being published and promulgated. The document, also named \\"Pragmática Sanción\\", was published along a few others, signed by Minister of Justice. Certified as based on original documentation stored in the ministry archive, they detailed the events of 1789 and until today they remain the key if not the only source on the succession debate during the Cortes of Charles IV. The 1830 regulation was rendering also a would-be daughter of Fernando VII a potential heir to the throne. At the moment of its publication the document seemed pointless, as the king had no children at all and the throne was expected to pass to Don Carlos anyway. However, in May 1830 it was announced that the queen was pregnant, and in October 1830 she gave birth to a daughter. At this point the 1830 document would have relegated Don Carlos to the second-in-succession; he refused to recognize its legality and the dynastic crisis ensued. As it overlapped with political conflict between pro-liberal and anti-liberal groupings, the crisis turned into an open conflict, resulting in a series of civil wars which kept rocking the country and lingered until the 20th century. Was the 1713 law changed? Don Carlos Though proceedings of the 1789 Cortes have been consigned into nearly perfect oblivion for the lifetime of almost one generation, starting the 1830s they turned into the point of extremely heated political, juridical and historical debate. The question of what had actually been decided, and more specifically whether the 1789 Cortes abrogated the 1713 succession law, became perhaps the most controversial constitutional issue in the 19th century Spain. In the 1830s \\"rivers of ink\\"Jordi Canal, El carlismo, Madrid 2000, , p. 52. were spilled over the problem, taking shape of countless booklets, leaflets and press articles, produced by those claiming the 1713 law had been changed in 1789best known early works are Juan Donoso Cortes, Memoria sobre la situación actual de la Monarquía, Madrid 1832; Marqués de Miraflores, Memoria histórico-leqal sobre las leves de sucesión a la Corona de España, Madrid 1833; José de la Peña Aguayo, Discurso histórico-legal sobre el derecho de la princesa Isabel Luisa a la sucesión de la corona por el fallecimiento sin hijos varones de su padre el Sr. D.

The debate continued during the following decades, recording another climax in the late 1860s and early 1870s.perhaps the best works of that period representing \\"1789 was not legal\\" and \\"1789 was legal\\" positions were respectively Antonio Aparisi Guijarro, La cuestión dinastica, Madrid 1869, and Placido Maria de Montoliu y de Sarriera, ¿Don Alfonso ó Don Carlos? estudio histórico-legal, Madrid 1872. In the 1880s and afterwards the question was eclipsed by a number of ongoing juridical issues and became a historical rather than a legal one, though debates persisted well into the 20th century, animated mostly by longevity of Carlism.compare the works of Francisco Elías de Tejada, due to his erudite standing perhaps the most prestigious and outspoken exponent of the Carlist juridical reading of the late 20th century, e.g his Il Carlismo, Palermo 1979. The opinion that the 1789 Cortes had not altered the 1713 regulations seems to support dynastic claims of Don Carlos and his followers; hence, scholars holding such opinion are usually either auto-defined or labeled as Carlists. They quote an enormous list of arguments supposed to prove their point: the key one is that as the 1789 accord between the Cortes and king was not formally published as a law, it did not enter into force.especially that the enactment of June 12, 1714, specified that \\"all the laws of the Kingdom which have not been expressly abrogated by subsequent ones, shall literally be observed\\", Walton 1834, p. 20. Other arguments, some of them contradictory, claim that deputies were not legally entitled to discuss the issue as their lacked a so-called mandato imperativo, that Campomanes abused the will of Carlos IV, that according to the lex retro non agit rule the law could have not affected Don Carlos, who was already 1 year old in 1789, that proceedings would have been legal prior, but not after swearing allegiance to prince Fernando, that Carlos IV has never formally endorsed the Cortes petition, that there is no such thing as \\"secret laws\\", that Novisima Recopilación of 1805 confirmed binding legal status of the 1713 regulations, that the 1789 draft could have been declared law until 1808 but no later, as Cortes entitled only Carlos IV, and not his successors, to make it binding, that most documentation on 1789 events was released in 1830 and could have been tampered with, that the whole process was sort of a coup agreed between Floridablanca and Campomanes, and other points.review of typical arguments used by both sides in Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, La primera guerra carlista [Ph.D. thesis Universidad Complutense 1991], pp. 76-77. The opinion that the 1789 Cortes had altered the 1713 succession law supported the dynastic claim of Fernando's descendants; hence, scholars holding such opinion were usually deemed Cristinos, Isabellinos or Alfonsinos. They repudiated arguments pointing to non-binding legal character of the 1789 events; the key line of reasoning was that Carlos IV in full agreement with the Cortes adopted a new law, and publication was a minor technical issue. They advance other claims, some of them also contradictory: that deputies were specifically asked to come equipped with powers to discuss all issues, that the law was not applied retroactively as Fernando's daughter Isabel had not been born at the time, that Carlos IV formally approved of the Cortes petition, that author of Novisima Recopilación was not aware of the 1789 law, and that Fernando as the son of Carlos IV inherited also the right to publish the law at the time he deemed proper. Some claim that the law entered into force in 1789 and refer to \\"Pragmatic Sanction of Carlos IV/of 1789\\",Javier Tussell, Historia de España, Madrid 2001, , p. 44, Manuel Tuñón de Lara, Julio Vadeón Baruque, Antonio Domínquez Ortiz, Secundino Serrano, Historia de España, Valladolid 1999, , p. 417. some claim that it entered into force upon publication in 1830 and refer to \\"Pragmatic Sanction of Fernando VII/of 1830\\",Miguel Artola (ed.), Enciclopedia de Historia de España, vol. 5, , p. 741. some refer to both.even the names applied to various documents are contested. Most Alfonsist historians refer to the 1713 regulation as \\"Auto Acordado\\", while most Carlist historians claim that such a nomination is conscious attempt to play down importance of the regulation, which should rather be named \\"Ley Fundamental\\", compare Aparisi 1869, pp. 57-58. Legal scholarly discourse in Santos M. Coronas, De las leyes fundamentales a la constitución política de la monarquía española (1713-1812), [in:] Annuario del Historia del Derecho Español LXXXI (2011), pp. 14, 18-20. Other questions Carlota Joaquina Apart from the problem of legally binding or non-binding nature of the 1789 events, there are other questions related. The two which stand out are the motives for launching the procedure of changing the 1713 law and the motives for keeping the process and its outcome secret. Many scholars suggest that the initiative should be considered against the broad background of foreign policy, mostly though not exclusively related to a would-be union with Portugal. In September 1788 prince João, upon the unexpected death of his older brother, became heir to the Portuguese throne, and his wife Carlota Joaquina, daughter of Carlos IV, became a queen-in-waiting. Her assumption of the Spanish throne would enable a Spanish-Portuguese union, a constant objective of Spanish foreign policy since medieval times.Prieto 1978, pp. 314-5, 319, Longares Alonso 1974, p. 160. Another important motive speculated upon was ensuring succession to descendants of Carlos IV. In 1789 he had 4 daughters, aged 14, 10, 7 and a 2-month baby, plus two sons, aged 5 and 1. He also experienced earlier death of his 4 other sons, who had died at the age of 3, 3, 1 and 1. It is supposed that fearing potential death of his remaining sons, still in early infancy, Carlos IV intended to secure succession to his daughters, who had already grew out of the very dangerous early age.Prieto 1978, p. 311, Enrique Giménez López, El fin del Antiguo Régimen. El reinado de Carlos IV, Madrid 1996, , p. 14. One more motive would have been that the 1713 law limited succession to males born in Spain; with Carlos IV born in Naples, it might have served as a remote yet usable legal claim against his rule.Prieto 1978, p. 313, Longares Alonso 1974, pp. 160-161. Finally, some historians point to intentions of re- establishing traditional Spanish regulations just for the sake of their traditional nature.Fernando García de Cortazar, Historia de España, Barcelona 2004, , p. 182. Nuances of foreign policy are also usually quoted as motives for keeping the proceedings secret; it is supposed that Carlos IV feared adverse reaction of the courts in Paris and Naples, especially that when the news of 1789 agreement leaked out despite the renewed secrecy oath, both monarchs protested to Madrid.Longares Alonso 1974, p. 161. Following outbreak of the Revolution, France was deemed unpredictable and Carlos IV is seen as determined to avoid provoking his northern neighbor.Prieto 1978, pp. 327-330. There are also scholars who suspect that Carlos IV from the onset intended to apply or not to apply the 1789 rule depending upon the circumstances, and that secrecy allowed him more room for maneuvering. Finally, some authors admit that reasons for keeping the decision secret are unclear.Antonio Domínguez Ortiz, España, tres milenios de historia, Madrid 2013, , p. 260. Other questions related to the 1789 Cortes are less fundamental and mostly remain open. Was the 1789 Cortes routine or exceptional? To what extent the procedure was inspired by ilustrados and other proponents of a new line? Did the Cortes strengthen or weaken the absolutist position of the king? To what extend Floridablanca and Campomanes influenced the Cortes? Who was the moving spirit behind the attempt to alter the succession law: Floridablanca, queen Maria Luisa, Carlos IV? Did the deputies adopt royal proposal swiftly and unanimously because they appreciated the motives, because they were servile or for some other reason?Prieto 1978, pp. 261, 324. Current historiographic reading left Though the object of heated debate in the 19th century, today the question of succession law of 1789 generates little interest among professional historians; the last identified dedicated monograph comes from 1978.Prieto 1978. Some authors consider the succession issue the only important point of the 1789 Cortes,\\"aquellas Cortes fueran disueltos precipitamente sin haber hecho otra cosa importante sino proponer la derogación de un auto promulgado por Felipe V. [...] Carlos IV admitió la petición pero no llegó a promulgar la ley correspondiente\\", Manuel Tuñón de Lara, Julio Vadeón Baruque, Antonio Domínquez Ortiz, Secundino Serrano, Historia de España, Valladolid 1999, , p. 352. some discuss it as a minor problem, second to questions of rural rent, mayorazgos and other agrarian issues.Longares Alonso 1974 dedicates 40 pages to rural issues discussed during the Cortes and 7 (last) pages to dynastical question. In some syntheses the 1789 debate is not at all noted in chapters dedicated to Carlos IV, only briefly referred to when discussing the 1830 document of Fernando VII.perhaps the best example is a monumental series Historia de España Memendez Pidal; the volume dedicated to the reign of Carlos IV did not mention the 1789 debate, which was only briefly referred when discussing the 1830 regulations, compare José María Jover Zamora (ed.), Historia de España, vol. XXXII, Madrid 1992, , p. 925. In general, most historians tend to avoid normative pronouncements on the 1789 process, though wording used in different works can vary enormously and might suggests distinct interpretations. One group of works sort of imply that in 1789 the succession law was effectively changed. There are authors who claim that Carlos IV decreed the Pragmatic Sanction, though he kept it secret;\\"En abril de 1830 se mandó publicar la Pragmática Sanción, decretada por Carlos IV en 1789 pero mantenida en secreto su contenido, al autorizar la sucesión femenina, evitaba cualquier posibilidad de que don Carlos se convirtiera en rey', Javier Tussell, Historia de España, Madrid 2001, , p. 44. \\"In 1789 Ferdinand's father, Carlos IV, had used a secret session of the Spanish Cortes to issue a decree opening up the royal succession to female as well as male heirs. This broke with the Salic Law which the Bourbon victor of the 1701-1713 War of the Spanish Succession, Philip V, had conferred on his new dynasty\\", M. Lawrence, Spain's First Carlist War, 1833-40, New York 2014, , p. 3. \\"los diputados votaron también una pragmática que [...] restableciá el antiguo orden sucesorio; pero por motivos no muy claros [...] no fue promulgada\\", Antonio Domínguez Ortiz, España, tres milenios de historia, Madrid 2013, , p. 260. others tend to agree vaguely that the 1713 law was effectively altered in 1789, though the decision was not published.\\"Las Cortes de 1789 restablecieron el antiquo orden sucesorio, pero su no publicación como pragmática impidió que fueron conocido adecuadamente este restablecimiento\\", Enrique Martínez Ruiz, Enrique Giménez, José Antonio Armillas, Consuelo Maqueda, La España moderna, Madrid 1992, , p. 561. Another group of works is fathered by students who wrote highly ambiguous paragraphs; some note that the 1713 law was indeed changed in 1789, but the decision was put into effect in 1830,\\"Esta ley [of 1713] no fue modificada hasta 1789, en que las Cortes votaron a favor de la restauración del regimen fijado en las Partidas, en que no se hacian distinción de sexos. El voto de las Cortes no fue publicado y la Novisima Recopilación, por tanto, no lo reconoció. En 1830 Fernando decidió publicar la Pragmática Sanción con objeto de dar fuerza legal a la decisión de las Cortes\\", José María Jover Zamora (ed.), Historia de España, vol. XXXII, Madrid 1992, , p. 925. some point that the 1713 law \\"was modified during the reign of Carlos IV\\" but also that the new regulation was promulgated in 1830;\\"El Auto acordado de 1713, que excluía a las mujeres de la sucesión mientras hubiese descendencia masculina en las ramas diracta o colateral, fue modificado en tiempos de Carlos IV. Las Cortes votaron en 1789 a favor de restaurar los viejos usos sucesorios fijados en la Ley de Partidas, segun la cual no debía introducirse ninguna distinción de sexos. Esta modificación, sin embargo, no se publicó, por lo que la Novísima Recopilación de 1805 no llegaría a incorporarla. En marco de 1830, el rey Fernando VII dio simplemente el paso siguente a la aprobación en Cortes, esto es, promulgar la ley\\", Canal 2000, pp. 52-53. some claim that Carlos IV did not promulgate a corresponding law, but at the same time refer to \\"Pragmatic Sanction of Carlos IV\\".\\"aquellas Cortes fueran disueltos precipitamente sin haber hecho otra cosa importante sino proponer la derogación de un auto promulgado por Felipe V. [...] Carlos IV admitió la petición pero no llegó a promulgar la ley correspondiente\\", proceeding later to claim that \\"Fernando VII reiteraba por decreto la Pragmática Sanción de Carlos IV\\", Manuel Tuñón de Lara, Julio Vadeón Baruque, Antonio Domínquez Ortiz, Secundino Serrano, Historia de España, Valladolid 1999, , p. 417. Also \\"Since Pragmatic Sanction of Carlos IV in 1789, seeking to reverse the law [of 1713], was never promulgated, this eighteenth-century novelty [of 1713] survived to give the Carlist pretenders of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries their claim to legitimate kingship\\", Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 1975, , p. 4.

The author of the latest monograph on the issue adopts one more perspective, namely that the 1789 events should not be viewed in isolation but analyzed as one of 8 phases, starting with the law of 1713 and ending with the decree of 1832.the chain of events would be composed of 8 phases: 1) Auto Acordado of 1713; 2) derogation of 1789; 3) not publishing of the 1789 derogation; 4) Novissima Recopilacíon of 1805; 5) pronouncement of Juna Suprema de Cádiz; 6) Pragmatica of 1830; 7) Codicilo of 1832; 8) Declaración de Palacio of 1832, Prieto 1978, p. 340.

Atangana has a disability as a result of contracting polio when he was very young. After representing Cameroon internationally, Atangana and two other Cameroonian para-sportspeople went to France where they applied for refugee status. He resides in Nantes, France. The Cameroon international first got involved with para-sports through sitting volleyball. He moved to Cameroon's capital to train more seriously, switching to powerlifting, wheelchair basketball and athletics. He went on to represent Cameroon in all three sports, including at the 2012 Summer Paralympics where he was his country's first Paralympian ever at the 2012 Games. He has won several medals at the African Francophone Games for the Handicapped.  Personal  Born in 1987 in Yaounde, Atangana contracted polio when he was very young. The illness left him with physical disability that affected his left leg, and he gets around on crutches. Eventually, Atangana and fellow Cameroonian para- sportspeople Jean Solange Avah Mbida and Herve Ndi decided the problems in Cameroon were too bad, and went to Pas-de-Calais, France as refugees. The group chose the city because Cameroonian football Marc-Vivien Foé was there to aid in their transition. He has two daughters, and lives in Nantes, France.  Sports  Atangana first got involved with sports in 2004, when he started playing sitting volleyball. People suggested he move to Cameroon's capital to train more seriously in sitting volleyball. Doing this, he then went on to compete at the 2006 African Francophone Games for the Handicapped, representing Cameroon as a member of the national wheelchair basketball team and competing in powerlifting, picking up gold medals in both sports. After representing Cameroon internationally in powerlifting, athletics and wheelchair basketball, he went to France as a refugee where he continued to be involved in all three sports. = Powerlifting = Atangana competed at the 2006 African Francophone Games for the Handicapped (French: '), where he won a gold medal in powerlifting. He was back again for the 2007 edition in Nouakchott, Mauritania, the 2009 edition in Niamey, Niger and the 2011 edition in Yaoundé where he won gold each time. He participated in the 2008 African Francophone Games for the Handicapped, winning gold in the men's -52 kg event with a lift of 140 kg. Five Cameroonian powerlifters competed in the 2011 IPC Fazza Powerlifting-Dubai, with Atangana ultimately earning a qualifying berth for London following the competition. At a 2012 IPC Powerlifting event in Dubai, he managed a lift of 160 kg. Atangana was still involved with the sport following the 2012 Games, competing in the first ranking competition for the 2016 Summer Paralympics, an event in September 2015 in Brazzaville, Congo. He finished third in the -59 kg class with a best lift of 160 kg. He finished 2015 being ranked nineteenth in the world in the men's -59 kg class with a season best lift of 160 kg. He was unranked in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014.  Paralympics  Atangana was the country's sole representative at the 2012 Games where the country made its Paralympic debut. Competing in powerlifting's men's -56 kg event in London, Atangana finished ninth in an eleven deep field, with a best lift of 155 kg. Atangana was the country's flag bearer for the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Games. Atangana said he planned to return home after the Games, with no intention of fleeing like his 2012 Olympic colleagues did. Prior to the start of the London Games, the Cameroon delegation was at the University of Bath from August 15 to August 19. There, Atangana and seven other Cameroon para-powerlifters worked with international trainers to recalibrate their form for competition as Cameroon lacked the technical knowledge to provide adequate coaching in country. Funding problems for the Cameroon delegation were the major reason that Atangana was the country's sole representative in London. Getting access to funds to compete in London as easier as he was based in Nantes, France. = Athletics = Atangana is a T53/F53 classified athlete. Participating at the 2007 Algerian Games (French: Jeux d'Alger), he had a fourth-place finish in the shot put. Competing at the home hosted 2008 African Francophone Games for the Handicapped, he won a silver medal in the shot put. Cameroon sent a delegation to the 2013 Czech Open. Atangana won a bronze medal at the competition in the javelin. Atangana also competed at the 2014 Paris Seine-S Paralympic Athletics Meeting, finishing 6th in the javelin event with a throw of 17.93 meters and sixth in the shot put with a throw of 6.81 meters. = Wheelchair basketball = A 3.5 point player, Atangana has made multiple appearances for the Cameroon men's national team. He competed at the 2006 African Francophone Games for the Handicapped as a member of the Cameroon national team. His team took home a gold medal. He replicated this accomplishment at the 2007 and 2008 editions. He was part of the Cameroon squad at the 2007 All-Africa Games in Algeria.

It has rough, stringy bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped to elliptical or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, creamy white flowers and urn-shaped fruit. Description Corymibia jacobsiana is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber and rhizomes. It has rough, stringy, yellow-brown to grey-brown bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have hairy, glossy dark green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, arranged in opposite pairs, linear, long and wide on a short petiole. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, glossy dark green above, much paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped to elliptical or curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped or spherical, about long and wide with a rounded to conical or beaked operculum. The tree is thought to flower between February and April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. The seeds are flattened, dull to semi-glossy and red or red-brown and saucer-shaped. Corymbia jacobsiana has no close relatives. It is solated from all other bloodwoods by the combination of rough stringybark and sparsely hairy juvenile leaves, carpeted on the underside with white hairs. Taxonomy and naming Jacob's bloodwood was first formally described by the botanist William Blakely in 1934 in his book, A Key to the Eucalypts and given the name Eucalyptus jacobsiana. The type specimens were collected by \\"Dr. M. R. Jacobs\\" north of Pine Creek in 1933. Jacobs was a distinguished forester and the Principal of the Australian Forestry School in Canberra from 1945 to 1961. Botanists Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson were the first to define the genus Corymbia in 1995, identifying the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums as a group distinct from Eucalyptus. They changed the name of this species to Corymbia jacobsiana. Distribution Corymbia jacobsiana occurs throughout the top end of the Northern Territory, usually in monsoonal woodland areas and usually as part of a tropical savannah woodland mix with eucalpyts and cypress, growing in sand or clay soils or in dissected sandstone. It has an erratic distribution around Pine Creek, Tipperary Station and further east in Arnhem Land, often found with Corymbia arnhemensis and C. nesophila. The plant's rhizomes allow it to form dense clones following fires, and that later thin out to form woodlands.

She is remembered first and foremost for her research and publications on the history of the Danish language but she was also an expert runologist who published a comprehensive analysis of all known runic inscriptions in Denmark. From 1911, Jacobsen played a major role in all fields of research related to the Danish language. Early life and education Born on 29 January 1882 in Copenhagen, Jacobsen grew up in a rich Jewish family, the daughter of Marcus Rubin (1854–1923), director of the National Bank of Denmark, and his wife Kaja Davidsen (1854–1909). After matriculating from N. Zahle's School in 1900, she qualified as a schoolteacher in 1903. The same year she married the historian Jacob Peter Jacobsen. In 1904, she began to study Scandinavian philology at Copenhagen University where she was awarded the university's gold medal for her 1907 essay Naar og hvorledes har det fællesnordiske Sprog spaltet sig i forskellige Grene (When and how the common Nordic language broke up into different branches). After receiving her master's degree in 1908, in 1910 she became Denmark's first woman to earn a doctorate in Nordic philology with a thesis titled Studier til det danske Rigssprogs Historie fra Eriks Lov til Chr. III.s Bibel (Studies on the History of the Danish Language from Erik's Law to Christian III's Bible). Career Realizing the limitations of further research into the Danish language owing to the absence of adequate texts and dictionaries, in 1911, thanks to the support of Kristian Erslev and Carl S. Petersen, she founded the Society for Danish Language and Literature (Det danske sprog- og litteraturselskab or DSL) which she headed until 1931, whereafter she served as administrator. DSL gained importance through the publication of Jacobsen's numerous works. In collaboration with Harald Juul-Jensen (1982–1949), Jacobsen organized the work of publishing a comprehensive Danish dictionary, Ordbog over det danske Sprog which appeared in 28 volumes from 1919 to 1956. As a result of her interest in runes, thanks to the support of the Carlsberg Foundation and in collaboration with Erik Moltke, Danmarks Runeindskrifter (Denmark's Runic Inscriptions) was published in 1942, a 3 volume work with descriptions, photographs of all surviving runetones, illustrations of destroyed runestones when available, maps and an index. Danmarks Runeindskrifter provides the same level of completeness for runestones throughout Viking Age Denmark, geographically covering modern Denmark, Southern Schleswig, Scania, Halland and Blekinge. In addition, a pocket size version with the same title was published only containing short descriptions of the runestones. After the Second World War, Jacobsen continued to organize and initiate the creation of other important works, including Nordisk Kultur (Nordic Culture) and Kulturhistorisk Leksikon for nordisk Middelalder (Encyclopedia of Medieval Scandinavia), completed in 1979. In 1952, she launched work on the popular Nudansk Ordbog (Dictionary of Modern Danish) and, in 1957, on Synonymordbogen (Synonym Dictionary). Lis Jacobsen died in Hellerup on 18 June 1961 and is buried in Sindbjerg near Vejle. Her husband died from tuberculosis in 1918, leaving her two teenager daughter, one born deaf.

Geography Bangus is about 150 Kilometers away from Srinagar and lies at an altitude of 10,000 ft. above sea level. The principal valley is locally known as \\"Badi Bangus\\" (Big Bangus) and has an estimated area of about 300 Square Kilometers. It consists of a linear elliptical bowl aligned along the east-west axis and is surrounded by Rajwar and Mawar in the east, Shamasbury and Dajlungun Mountains in the west and Chowkibal and Karnah Guli in the north. Kazinag Range (Up to 4732 meters from sea level) in the south. A smaller valley known as \\"Lokut Bangus\\" (Small Bangus) lies on the north-eastern side of the main valley. There are two routes to visit this place one from Chowkibal kralpora and other Handwara. This place is best suitable for trackers. The valley is traversed by many small streams with nearly 14 tributaries, including the Roshan Kul, Tillwan Kul and Douda Kul. The water of these streams form one of the headwaters of the Kamil River which in turn joins the Lolab stream, thus forming the Pohru River. Flora and fauna Bangus is replete with a diverse variety of flora and fauna. The meadows and the slopes of the side plateaus are covered with a range of flowers and medicinal plants. Fresh water fishes of moderate size and their fingerlings inhabit the streams. The valley's forests and plains serve as the breeding, feeding and protection grounds for many wild animal species. The wild life of includes about 50 species of animals and about 10 species of birds. The animal species include the musk deer, antelope, snow leopard, brown bear, black bear, monkeys, and red fox. A large number of residents and migratory birds can also be found feeding and breeding in the valley. The prominent resident birds include pheasants, tragophan, monal pheasant, black partridge, bush quail, and wild fowl. Tourism Bangus has remained largely restricted and an unfavorable tourist spot due to the armed conflict that affects this area, and also due to the lack of infrastructure. However, in recent years, efforts have been made to bring the valley on the tourist map.

It served as the country's National Paralympic Committee for many years. Problems with internal governance arose starting in the early 2000s and continued until the federation closed. FECASH was one of the organizations to support the introduction of goalball in Cameroon. They also participated in United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities activities.  Governance  Cameroonian Sports Federation for People with Disabilities (FECASH) was created in 1998 for people with a variety of different types of disabilities. The federation was based on Doula, and had four member organizations: Federation of Disabled Sport of Cameroon,The name of the organization in French is, '. Sports Association of Blind and Partially Sighted of Cameroon (ASAMC),The name of the organization in French is, '. National League Sports for the Deaf in Cameroon (LINASCAM),The name of the organization in French is, '. and Special Olympics Cameroon. The offices for the Federation from 1998 to early 2010 were at the personal residence of Abeng Mbozo'o, a non-disabled Cameroon doctor. Mbozo'o served as the organizations chairman, with each of the member federations being represented with a Vice President position in FECASH. = History of governance = For a long while, the organization was largely run by the president after all the members resigned. During its early history, FECASH had trouble securing funding. For three years, they had an annual government grant of 4.5 million XOF (€6,854). After the initial three years, government terminated the subsidy. FECASH was founded in 1998, and became affiliated with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). At the time, the President of FECASH did not seek government approval prior to affiliating with the IPC. FECASH's original president subsequently moved to Japan. In 2004, a former FECASH Vice-President created a new NPC for Cameroon without approval from the government. He subsequently moved to the United States. In the late 2000s, a third NPC for Cameroon was then created after that called Cameroon Paralympic Club (CPC)The name of the organization in French is, '. which also failed to get government approval before trying to become the IPC recognized NPC. The CPC was led by President Etienne Songa. Songa challenged the government's claim of failure for recognition. Songa claimed that FECASH, as a result of owing the IPC money, had notified the IPC that the Cameroon Paralympic Club should be recognized as the NPC for Cameroon. Songa's statements were supported by CPC Technical Director Jean-Marie Aléokol Mabiemé. FECASH had other issues in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Having statues was a then requirement of the International Paralympic Committee to be a member of the IPC in good standing. FECASH lacked governing statues in 2008. These problems related to internal governance were one of the reasons why Cameroon was unable to inscribe any participants for the 2008 Summer Paralympics. FECASH was restructured in March 2011, before being dissolved in July 2011 as a result of Law No. 2011-18 of 15 July 2011 related to the organization and promotion of Physical and Sporting Activities. It was replaced by the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Visually Impaired (FECASDEV),The name of the organization in French is, '. the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Physically Disabled (FECASDEP),The name of the organization in French is, '. Cameroonian Federation of Sports the Intellectually Disabled (FECASDI)The name of the organization in French is, '. and the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Deaf (FECASSO).The name of the organization in French is, '. These four organizations were thane made members of the newly reformed Cameroonian Paralympic Committee. Before the organization's dissolution, Chairman Mbozo'o blamed some of the organization's failures on the Government Minister Pierre Ismaël Bidoung Mkpatt for appointing members to FECASH's board who then were completely absent from governing the organization. He also blamed the Government not providing funding to the organization.  History  FECASH supported the introduction of goalball in the country during the 2000s to diversify the number of sports available to people with vision impairments. For the 2009 United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities, FECASH organized nationwide sporting activities for people with disabilities. They held three regional wheelchair basketball tournaments, with the tournaments taking place in central Cameroon, southern Cameroon and coastal Cameroon. One of these tournaments took place in Douala, on the basketball courts of Military District 2. A goalball tournament also was organized at the Sports Palace in Yaounde. Deaf soccer, handball and basketball events also took place, with the Lions Indomptables Sourd playing a friendly match against a high school team from Nkomotou. The events also served as a celebration for the national delegation who went to Niamey, Niger for the 2009 African Francophone Games for the Handicapped. The team returned having finished third in the overall medal count, winning 23 medals, 10 gold, 7 silver and 6 bronze.

It was described by the French entomologist Guillaume-Antoine Olivier in 1789. An older name coined by Martini & Goeze in 1778, Aranea cruciger, has been declared a nomen oblitum, allowing Olivier's later name to stand. Description The male Textrix dendiculata is similar to the female in general appearance. The carapace is dark brown with a light median band. The head is narrow, with steep sides, not unlike wolf spiders of the genus Pardosa. The abdomen is dark brown with a light horse-shoe shaped marking towards the anterior which breaks down into a series of light spots towards the posterior. There are vague, somewhat reddish chevrons due to the relatively thinner coating of hairs between the horseshoe mark and the posterior spotting which causes the background colour of the abdomen to be visible. The legs are yellow-brown with dark annulations and rings of white hairs. The body length of the female is 7–8 mm, that of the slightly smaller male 6–7 mm. Biology Textrix denticulata builds small funnel webs that end in a tube where the spider sits until it detects its prey touch the web when it leaves the tube and subdues the prey. It is mostly active at night. Both sexes are mainly found from early to mid-summer but females can be found at most times of the year and males have also been recorded in September. The yellow egg sac contains 50-60 eggs and is covered with soil particles and stones and secured under rocks and in crevices. Habitat Textrix denticulata is found in sunny edges of forests, on rocks and on walls and sometimes in houses. In Great Britain it is found on stony ground, in rocky crevices, on low bushes and under bark, both inland and in coastal areas. Here too it is equally common in houses and on some disused stony industrial sites. Distribution Textrix denticulata is widespread in Northern Europe, except the northern and eastern part. In Great Britain this spider is common in the north, less so in the south, and very rare in the southeast.

The post prompted outrage among Chinese netizens. In a statement on BNP Paribas's global website, the French bank apologised for \\"the offence caused by those social media posts that were expressed on one of [its] employees’ personal accounts\\", and added that while it respects its employees’ freedom of expression, it does not tolerate \\"language that is racist or disrespectful\\".Statement from BNP Paribas regarding incident involving our employee (13 September 2019) BNP Paribas In an interview with CNBC, Jean Lemierre, chairman of BNP Paribas, said that Ng's “inappropriate words were not compatible at all with the standards of the bank”.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and flowers that are whitish or pinkish on the front, but yellowish-green on the back and a cream-coloured labellum with dark red markings. Description Caladenia atrochila is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which grows singly or in small, loose groups. It has an underground tuber and a single, sparsely hairy, narrow linear, dull green leaf, long and less than wide. There are one or two flowers in diameter borne on a fairly thick, hairy spike high. The dorsal sepal is erect, long, about wide, and narrow egg-shaped. The lateral sepals and petals are lance-shaped, long, about wide, whitish or pinkish on the front and yellowish-green on the back. The labellum is about long and about wide and cream-coloured with dark crimson lines. It has three distinct lobes and is erect near its base then more or less horizontal. The lateral lobes are about wide, erect and partly enclose the column. The mid-lobe is a narrow triangular shape, about long, wide with between two and four pairs of teeth on its edges. There are two rows of yellow calli with dark red stalks in the centre of the labellum. The column is long and curves forward near its end. Flowering occurs in November but the flowers are only open for a day or two before self-pollinating. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia atrochila was first formally described by David Jones in 1998 and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The type specimen was collected in Callaghans Scrub near the Arthur River. The specific epithet (atrochila) is derived from the Latin word ater meaning \\"black\\" and the Ancient Greek word cheilos meaning \\"lip\\" referring to the dark lines on the labellum.

The next day, she expressed regret for \\"saying half\\", while insisting that Trump had deplorably amplified \\"hateful views and voices\\". The Trump campaign repeatedly used the phrase against Clinton during and after the 2016 presidential election. Many Trump supporters adopted the \\"deplorable\\" moniker for themselves in reappropriation. Some journalists and political analysts questioned whether this incident played a role in the election's outcome. Clinton admitted in her 2017 book What Happened that it was one of the factors for her loss. Background Throughout her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton expressed her concerns regarding Donald Trump and his supporters. The New York Times and CNN cited Clinton's earlier articulation of similar ideas to the phrase in her August 25, 2016 campaign speech at a rally in Reno, Nevada. In that speech, Clinton had criticized Trump's campaign for using \\"racist lies\\" and allowing the alt- right to gain prominence, claiming that Trump was \\"taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party\\". Clinton also criticized Trump for choosing Steve Bannon as his chief executive officer, especially given Bannon's role as the executive chair of the far- right news website Breitbart News. Clinton read various headlines from the site, including \\"Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?\\" and \\"Hoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage\\". On that same day, Clinton posted a video on Twitter depicting white supremacists supporting Donald Trump. Within the video is a CNN interview wherein Trump initially declined to disavow white nationalist David Duke. During campaign fundraisers in August 2016, Clinton reportedly explained her divide and conquer approach to courting Republican voters by putting Trump supporters into two \\"baskets\\": everyday Republicans whom she would target and the alt-right crowd. During a September 8, 2016, interview on Israel's Channel 2, Clinton said: \\"You can take Trump supporters and put them in two big baskets. There are what I would call the deplorables—you know, the racists and the haters, and the people who are drawn because they think somehow he's going to restore an America that no longer exists.\\" Speech At an LGBT campaign fundraising event in New York City on September 9, Clinton gave a speech and said the following: Clinton response The following day Clinton expressed regret for \\"saying half\\", while insisting that Trump had deplorably amplified \\"hateful views and voices\\". At the second presidential debate in October 2016, after Trump mentioned the speech in a response to James Carter, debate moderator Anderson Cooper asked Clinton: \\"How can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?\\" Clinton responded to Cooper's question by saying: \\"My argument is not with his supporters, it's with him and the hateful, divisive campaign he has run\\". On October 20, 2016, during the 71st Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Clinton joked about the phrase, telling the guests: \\"I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables\\". =Clinton campaign= Clinton's campaign pointed to a series of polls that showed that some of Trump's supporters held negative views toward Latinos, African Americans, and Muslims. Clinton's campaign used the incident to try to force Trump's campaign members to denounce its extreme supporters. For example, after Mike Pence refused to call David Duke \\"deplorable\\", Clinton's running mate Tim Kaine accused Pence of enabling racism and xenophobia. Trump response Donald Trump criticized Clinton's remark as insulting his supporters. In a rally at Des Moines, Iowa, Trump stated: \\"While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country\\". During the rest of the election, Trump invited \\"deplorable Americans\\" on stage. For example, at a rally in Miami, Florida, on September 16, 2016, Trump parodied Les Misérables with the title Les Déplorables under the song \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\". Trump also used the label against Clinton in an advertisement, which claimed that Clinton herself is deplorable because she \\"viciously demoniz[es] hard working people like you\\". On November 8, 2017, one year after the election, Trump thanked his \\"deplorables\\" for his victory. =Trump campaign= Mike Pence responding to Clinton's comments Others in Trump's campaign responded negatively to the statement. Trump's running mate Mike Pence stated in a Capitol Hill meeting: \\"For Hillary Clinton to express such disdain for millions of Americans is one more reason that disqualifies her to serve in the highest office.\\" Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, had issued a statement on Twitter, claiming: \\"One day after promising to be aspirational & uplifting, Hillary insults millions of Americans.\\" Meanwhile, Roger Stone and Donald Trump Jr. posted a parody movie poster of The Expendables on Twitter and Instagram titled \\"The Deplorables\\", which included Pepe the Frog's face among those of members of the Trump family and other figures popular among the alt-right. In the final months of the election, the Trump campaign released official merchandise with the word \\"deplorable\\". =Trump supporters= Trump supporters in Prescott, Arizona, wearing shirts with the phrase \\"I am a deplorable\\" During and after the election, the \\"deplorables\\" nickname was reappropriated by many Trump supporters. Weeks before Trump's inauguration, various celebrations were held using word \\"deplorable\\". One notable celebration was DeploraBall, which was celebrated by Trump supporters and several members of the right at the National Press Building from January 19 to January 20, 2017. Analysis The day after Hillary Clinton's speech, some political analysts compared the statement to Mitt Romney's 47% gaffe in 2012. After the election, Diane Hessan, who had been hired by the Clinton campaign to track undecided voters, wrote in The Boston Globe that \\"all hell broke loose\\" after the \\"basket of deplorables\\" comment, which prompted what she saw as the largest shift of undecided voters towards Trump. Political scientist Charles Murray said, in a post-election interview with Sam Harris, that because the comment helped get Donald Trump elected, Murray agreed with Jonathan Haidt that it had \\"changed the history of the world, and he [Haidt] may very well be right. That one comment by itself may have swung enough votes, it certainly was emblematic of the disdain with which the New Upper Class looks at mainstream Americans.\\"Murray, Charles, \\"Charles Murray: Hillary Clinton's 'Deplorables' Comment May Have Changed The Course Of World History\\", RealClearPolitics, 25 April 2017, retrieved 12 April 2019 In an interview with CNN on December 4, 2016, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook said that the statement \\"definitely could have alienated\\" her voters. Meanwhile, Courtney Weaver of Financial Times believed that Clinton's comment had no effect on the election, stating: \\"To argue that one word cost Mrs Clinton the election is foolish.\\" However, Weaver acknowledged that the statement \\"did not hurt her opponent\\". James Taranto of The Wall Street Journal wrote that Clinton only stated that she regretted saying half without indicating whether she underestimated or overestimated. Spectator columnist Charles Moore compared the impact of the statement to that of British left-winger Nye Bevan's comments disparaging British Conservative Party members as \\"lower than vermin\\" in 1948. Moore noted that these remarks sparked a similar outrage and led to the formation of the \\"Vermin Club\\". Some Trump opponents turned the phrase against the Trump administration, for example Time writer Darlena Cunha opined that several members nominated for Trump's cabinet were a \\"basket of deplorables\\" spreading racism, Islamophobia, and antisemitism. In her 2017 book What Happened, Clinton said that her comments on the \\"basket of deplorables\\" were a factor in her electoral loss. Politicos Rich Lowry describes conservatives' interpretation of Clinton's use of the term as \\"an unfair, disparaging term for people who believe reasonable but politically incorrect things (immigration should be restricted, NFL players should stand during the national anthem, All Lives Matter, etc.)\\".

From 1972, he was studying camera the Prague Film and TV Academy (FAMU), which he successfully finished in 1978. Career Dobra's first attempts at photography began whe he was 15. The first publication of his photos in the Yugoslavian press were followed by a participation in many national exhibitions. Besides advertisement and creations of covers and calendars, Dobra inclined more and more towards artistic photography, which gradually became his main focus. The gold medal in the national competition and silver one in an international one were followed by his first personal exhibition in Prishtina, in 1977, and several other exhibitions in Czechoslovakia (Prague), Germany (Kassel), and other European countries. A poster to one of author's exhibitions in Prague In 1991, Dobra founded the first commercial photographic gallery in Czechoslovakia, which organized or participated in several exhibitions during the 1990s.

Dobra's works are often still lifes, featuring abstract themes of life (egg), contrasting elements (slice of a watermelon pressed into the carrier of an old bicycle) and surreal compositions, sometimes distantly inspired by works of classical surrealist painters such as René Magritte. Dobra’s photography is closely tied to the poetics of melancholy, often exhibited by using an old, rotten wall with a falling, mouldy plaster as a background, or other worn down items (not rarely in contrast to things colourful, new and fragile).

The interior of the first floor of the house retains most of the original Victorian decoration. After initial construction, a shed kitchen was added to the rear of the building. Most of the building is covered with a gabled roof, excepting the porch and shed kitchen which are covered by a shed roof.http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/018000/018100/018167/pdf/msa_se5_18167.pdf  Mrs. Ray's Boarding House  327 Montgomery Street was purchased in March 1919 by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray. In the spring of 1919 Thomas Ray suffered a stroke, and a one-story enclosed porch was constructed on the west side of the building to provide Ray a space to recuperate. At the same time the Rays began to rent out rooms in the house to provide supplemental income, and the building became known as Mrs. Ray's Boarding House.  Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower  Also in March 1919, then-Major Dwight D. Eisenhower was transferred from Fort Benning to Camp Meade, where he had previously organized the 65th Engineer Battalion in early 1918. In June 1919 his wife Mamie Eisenhower, who had been living in Denver with their son Doud, joined Dwight in Maryland while Doud remained in Colorado with family. Due to a housing shortage at Camp Meade, the Eisenhowers were forced to find off-base housing and rented a room on the second floor of the northwest corner of Mrs. Ray's Boarding House. The Eisenhowers remained in residence at 327 Montgomery Street for approximately six weeks, often taking their meals at another boarding house, Mrs. Halverson's Boarding House, located along U.S. Route 1. After approximately six weeks Mamie Eisenhower returned to Denver to be with Doud, and shortly after Dwight Eisenhower took part in the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy, which was designed to test and highlight the need for improved road construction throughout the nation. The Eisenhower House was added to the Maryland Historical Trust in 1985. See also *List of Laurel Maryland properties in the Maryland Historical Trust *Military career of Dwight D.

Instead of going on with his life, as suggested by his emotionally cold boss, as if nothing had happened, he breaks into this one. To get his credit card back, which was lost in the apartment, he seeks the help of an old friend, the former prisoner Vince Holland. From the initially one-off campaign, a series of burglaries develops, in which the two rob customers of Frederiks Bank at night. He gets deeper and deeper into crime, in which he can live out his dark side, while Vince actually wanted to end his criminal career. At the same time, Frederik finally finds the courage to approach his childhood sweetheart Nadine, who ended their relationship seven years ago, apparently by chance, because he has never overcome his love for her. Vince is meanwhile haunted by Reinier Grimm, a man from his earlier criminal days, who threatens him. Frederik has finally won back his childhood love and wants to live out their childhood dream, a trip to Iceland, with her. Before he sets off on the trip, however, he wants to prevent Vince from finally solving his problems with Grimm. However, Frederik cannot stop Vince who shoots Reinier Grimm after a fight on his estate. Back at the train station, Frederik is finally overwhelmed by the police.

It is often called the golden alpine salamander. Morphology Salamandra atra aurorae is very similar in body shape to all other subspecies of S. atra, also in all major characters that often distinguish different species of Salamandra: outline of the head, position of the vomerine teeth, proportions of body parts and limbs, arrangement of glandular bulges and pores on the skin, and shape and length of the tail. However, the body surface is not entirely and uniformly black as in most other populations of 'S. atra'. Conversely, the dorsal side of S. atra aurorae is broadly covered with yellow blotches and brown spots, which are broader and often coalescent on the head and the trunk, they are usually present also on the arms, the thighs and the tail, whereas they are rare on the flanks and the ventral sides. Blotches are invariantly present in all individuals, but highly variable in extent (covering from slightly more than half of the dorsal surface to almost the entire dorsal surface) and in dominant hue (from pale yellow to marbled brown). The colour pattern is highly variable between individuals, without any obvious difference neither between sexes nor between sites. It is established at birth and it usually changes only slightly with growth. However, relatively rapid and extended changes from yellow to brown have been occasionally observed in captive individuals. Newly born individuals are about 50 mm long and less than 1 g, whereas adults may reach 134 mm in males and 139 mm in females, and 14 g in pregnant females. The sexual dimorphism is very slight, but it has not been investigated adequately. Like in other subspecies of S. atra, the cloacal region is usually swollen in the adult males. thumbhabitat of Salamandra atra aurorae, Altopiano dei Sette Comuni - photo by E. Romanazzi 270x270pxalt=early morning, taken by E. Romanazzi Distribution Salamandra atra aurorae lives only in the northern part of the Sette Comuni plateau, in the Venetian Prealps, NE Italy. The actual distribution is known only incompletely, because the animals are very elusive and therefore hard to detect, and adequate investigations have not been carried out. As to 2016, all documented or reliable records cluster in 12 areas, more than 0.7 km far from each other and approximately aligned West to East from Val Postesina to Monte Fossetta. However, it is unknown whether the populations detected in these areas are actually separated or instead connected through suitable intermediate areas. The estimated \\"area of occupancy\\" of S. atra aurorae is 26 km2. Habitat Areas inhabited by S. atra aurorae are in the range 1200–1800 m and include both moderately inclined slopes and narrow valleys facing south. The substrate is rocky, calcareous and karstic. Most sites are covered with forest stands with Beech, Silver Fir and Norway Spruce, with variable abundance of leaf litter, dead wood on the ground, and patches of grass and moss. Only a few records are from shrubby meadows. In the area of the Bosco del Dosso, S. atra aurorae inhabits only the inner parts of the forest, where old-growth stands of Silver Fir with Beech are apparently more suitable than thicker stands dominated by Norway Spruce. Among adults, habitat requirements are similar between males and females. Life cycle The life cycle of S. atra aurorae has been investigated only in part, but is probably similar to that documented for S. atra atra. The embryonic and larval development are completed in the uteri of the mother and take at least two years. The juvenile is born after completing metamorphosis, even though it may retain small residuals of gills for a period. Usually two juveniles are born together by a pregnant female. Behaviour Individuals overwinter underground, most probably at some depth in the soil, where they remain inactive for at least 6 months. Since late April to mid October, instead, they still spend most part of the time resting in the soil, however often in the most upper level, sometimes concealed under occasional shelters (e.g., stones emerging from the ground, dead wood or pieces of barks on the surface). During this period, they exit and move on the surface only when the surface is wet and the air is very humid, especially after intense rains following dry periods, independently from the daily cycle of light. At difference from other S. atra, S. atra aurorae does not exit regularly every day around dawn. Adult males are apparently more prone to epigean activity than females and juveniles. While juveniles disperse during the yearly season, adults are sedentary and remain within their home range also between years. Different shelters are used by a single individual within its home range, which is a few tens of square metres on average, without any obvious differences between males and females. Individual home ranges are partially overlapping, also between individuals of the same sex. The population density has been estimated up to hundreds of individuals per hectare.  Threats, conservation status, management  All forests inhabited by S. atra aurorae are exploited for wood since centuries. However, modern practices commonly employed in wood harvesting include the use of heavy machines moving on the ground during the season of activity of the animals. In addition to causing direct mortality, they compact the soil and remove the ground vegetation along broad stripes. As a consequence, the microhabitat conditions become locally unsuitable for S. atra aurorae. This is a critical point when considering the management of wood harvesting following the Storm Vaia, which has hit north- eastern Italy in the autumn 2018 damaging the woods where this salamander lives. Concerns have also been raised, especially in the past, for the negative impacts of the illegal and uncontrolled collection of specimens, primarily for pet trade, and for the alteration of the local microclimate as a consequence of the capture of water springs for human use. According to regional assessments following IUCN criteria, S. atra aurorae has been categorized as Vulnerable (VU) under criterion D2, because the “extent of occurrence” was estimated <20 km2. Instead, within the global assessment of the species S. atra, evaluators proposed to rank the subspecies S. atra aurorae as Critically endangered (CR), under criterion B1ab (iii), because it was considered comprising a single local population and the habitat quality was judged as declining. The range of distribution of S. atra aurorae is mainly in the Veneto Region, specifically in the Province of Vicenza, but a part is in the Province of Trento. Salamandra atra aurorae is listed in the Annex II (originally under the name 'Salamandra salamandra aurorae') and Annex IV (under the name 'Salamandra aurorae') of the EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC. As a consequence, killing, handling and disturbing these animals or altering their habitat are not allowed. Scientific surveys may be carried on only after obtaining a specific permit by the Italian \\"Ministero dell'ambiente e della tutela del territorio e del mare\\". Most of the known range is included in the Natura 2000 site IT3220036 “Altopiano dei Sette Comuni”. Public awareness of the uniqueness of S. atra aurorae has recently grown in the human communities of the Altopiano dei Sette Comuni. The animal is depicted in the logo of the local natural history museum “Museo Naturalistico Didattico Patrizio Rigoni\\" and in the logo of the local ice hockey team “Asiago Newts Hockey”. Taxonomy Salamandra atra aurorae had remained unknown to scientists up to 1978, when a specimen kept in a cage in a local temporary exhibition was noticed by a couple of biologists. The discovery was published for the first time in 1981. The taxonomic description and denomination appeared in the following year, first within an abstract for a congress and then in a detailed article. The subspecific name refers to Aurora, wife of the author of the description. For nomenclatural purposes, the type locality was designated as the “Bosco del Dosso, near Vaio di Pian del Morto, between val Remaloch and Val Rotta” and the holotype has been deposited in the Zoological Museum La Specola in Florence. Since the original description, S. atra aurorae has been almost universally distinguished at the subspecies rank, but it has been sometimes raised to the species rank. The taxonomic distinction of S. atra aurorae is corroborated by both phenotypic and genetic differences from all other populations of the S. atra: all specimens of S. atra aurorae have yellow blotches covering more than half of the dorsal surface, whereas the specimens of all other subspecies are either uniformly black or at most only sparsely spotted; additionally, genetic data suggests that S. atra aurorae represents a distinct lineage within S. atra. Mating between S. atra aurorae and S. atra atra has been observed under captive conditions, producing viable and fertile juveniles with narrower yellow patches.

It was active from 1949 to 1952, with a six month break; and from 1969 to the end of 1985. It is currently inactive. In 1979 the corps took part in the Sino-Vietnamese War. In 1984 it again fought in Vietnam. It was stationed in the Kunming Military Region. First Formation The 11th Corps was activated on March 1, 1949, from the 3rd Column, Zhongyuan Field Army. In March–December 1949 it was part of Ch'en Tsi- Lien's 3rd Army of the Second Field Army.Witson, 1972, 187. The Corps was composed of the 31st Division, 32nd Division and 33rd Division.Witson, 1972, 187 During the Chinese Civil War its commander was Chen Jiagui, and its political commissar was Zhang Qi. In early 1950 the corps was stationed in eastern Sichuan Province. During its deployment in Sichuan, the corps supported 18th Corps' invasion of Tibet. As the Civil War wound down, the corps was inactivated in July 1950. Its headquarters was transferred to the Navy's control and converted at Qingdao Naval Base into what is now the North Sea Fleet. 2nd Formation In January 1951, the 31st Division was detached and transferred to 12th Corps control, which later moved into Korea as a part of the People's Volunteer Army to support North Korea during the Korean War. In March, the 32nd and 33rd Divisions moved to Langfang, Hebei. In July, 11th Corps was reactivated from 32nd, 33rd and 182nd Divisions. The unit was a reserve formation for the People's Volunteer Army, but it never deployed into the Korean Peninsula. In October 1952 the corps was inactivated. The corps' headquarters was transferred to the Air Force's control and converted to Headquarters, 5th Air Force Corps. The 32nd Division was transferred to 16th Corps' control. The 33rd Division was deployed into Korea; after 1954 the division was attached to 26th Corps. The 182nd Division was converted into the 8th Railway Engineer Division. 3rd Formation On November14, 1969, the 11th Army Corps () was activated in Dali, Yunnan. The corps was composed of the 31st and 32nd Army Divisions, making it a rare example of a \\"Reduced Army Corps\\", which was composed of two, instead of three, divisions. An artillery regiment and an anti-aircraft artillery regiment were also attached. In May 1976, the Independent Tank Regiment of Kunming Military Region, formerly the 4th Independent Tank Regiment of Beijing Military Region, was attached to the corps. =Sino-Vietnamese War= In 1979 the corps took part in the Sino- Vietnamese War. During the conflict the corps was strengthened by taking the Independent Division of Yunnan Provincial Military Region under command; in May 1979, this division was renamed 33rd Army Division. 32nd Army Division was temporarily detached from the corps to form the reserve force of Kunming Military Region. The main force of 11th Army Corps, without its 32nd Army Division and its tank regiment, thrust into Vietnamese territory in the 55-day-long campaign. The division spent 22 days outside China and claimed to have destroyed one Vietnamese regiment and three battalions and captured Phong Thổ. The corps also claimed to have inflicted 2,899 casualties and taken 58 prisoners From April 4–29, 1984, 11th Army Corps was again in Vietnam and took part in the Battle of Zheyinshan. During its deployment, the corps claimed to have inflicted 500 casualties on the Vietnamese forces and to have captured 18 prisoners of war and 19 artillery pieces. From August 4 to December 9, 1984, 11th Army Corps took part in the Battle of Laoshan. During its deployment, the corps claimed 1,698 killed and one captured. =Disbandment= In December 1985 the corps was disbanded. 31st Army Division was transferred to 14th Army's control as 31st Motorized Infantry Division, a 'southern motorized infantry division'. 32nd Army Division was converted to 2nd Garrison Division of Chengdu Military Region, which was disbanded in 1992. 33rd Army Division was disbanded and merged with 65th Artillery Division as the anti-aircraft artillery brigade attached to 14th Army. The corps' tank regiment was merged with 14th Army Corps existing tank brigade.

After 1945 he became an important figure in the East German political establishment. He was a member of the ruling party's powerful Central Committee between 1954 and his death in 1981. He was also a member of the country's (less powerful) National Parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") between 1950 and 1981. Life Josef (\\"Sepp\\") Wenig was born in Leiter (today Řebří), a small village in the hills to the west of Pilsen in what was, at that time, western Bohemia, part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. His parents worked in a brickworks. However, by the time he was old enough to attend school the family had relocated to Germany, and he grew up in another rural location, Zeulenroda, a small country town to the west of Chemnitz. He left school in 1911. During the next three years, without at this stage entering into any formal training scheme, he took jobs in various sectors including transport and brick making. In 1914 he was conscripted into the army, serving throughout the war. After 1918 he worked in the transport sector till 1918 in Zeulenroda and in nearby Kahla. In March 1920 he was an active participant in the successful popular resistance to the Kapp Putsch. In 1924 he joined the recently formed Communist Party, remaining a member till the party was banned in the first part of 1933. He also became a member of the Red Front Fighter's League, effectively a quasi-military wing of the Communist Party. In 1929, possibly in response to the economic crisis, he abandoned his life on land and took work as a sailor. Between 1936 and 1939 he undertook a training as a ship's mechanic. After this, between 1939 and 1945, he worked as a boilerman and machinist on merchant ships. After the war Wenig returned to Zeulenroda, liberated from the Nazi regime a few months earlier by the United States army, but now administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone. He worked again in the transport sector for a local wholesaler. He reactivated his Communist Party membership and was one of thousands, in the Soviet zone, who lost no time in signing their party membership over to the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) following its contentious creation in April 1946. In 1948 Sepp Wenig responded to advertisements offering employment at the Wismut (mining company) which was being set up to operate uranium mines in the south-east of the Soviet zone. He gained rapid promotion, although at this stage top management positions in what was recognised as a strategically critical sector were reserved for Soviet personnel. It was a feature of the Soviet occupation zone, relaunched in October 1949 as the German Democratic Republic, that the ruling party was closely integrated into workplace structures, and from 1949 Sepp Wenig was a member of the SED sector leadership team (\\"SED-Gebietsleitung\\") at Wismut. 1949 was also the year in which he was appointed a labour inspector at the company's Schneeberg and Auerbach mines. During his career Josef Wenig received a remarkable number and range of honours from the state: the Hero of Labour award which he received in 1950 appears to have been the first of these. His immediate achievement had involved greatly exceeding a standard production quota. It was also in 1950 that he became a member of the National Parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"). Although voters were able only to vote for (or, at least in theory, against) a single list of candidates in general elections, the Volkskammer contained fixed quotas of members from various approved bloc parties and indeed from approved mass organisations. Sepp Wenig sat, formally, not as a representative of the ruling party but as a representative of the Trade Union Federation (\\"Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund\\" / FDGB). He was also a member of the FDGB national executive (\\"Bundesvorstand\\") between 1952 and 1958. In 1954 he became one of the 91 members of the Central Committee, formally the ruling party's leading element (except when a party conference was in session). He was still a member when he died twenty-six years later. Meanwhile, the ban on German nationals in top management positions at Wismut had been relaxed and in 1955 he moved to Karl-Marx-Stadt (as Chemnitz was then known) and became the company's General Director, with direct responsibility for the \\"Labour department\\". The Central Committee's congratulations to Wenig on reaching his 65th birthday follow the familiar formula: it is perhaps a more eloquent testimony to the way in which his contribution was valued by the authorities that he retained this post till 1966, when at the age of 70 he had comfortably passed the normal retirement age. He only retired formally in July 1968, by which time he was 72. Josef Wenig died in Karl-Marx-Stadt on 16 April 1981.

Developed by Artech Studios and published by Hasbro Interactive, Inc. and the mac version was published by MacSoft, this title was one of many inspired by the property dealing board games. It uses the same box art as a 1998 reissue of the 1995 Monopoly PC game. The game proved to be popular and was re-released as Monopoly New Edition (also known as Monopoly 3) on September 30, 2002, and published by Infogrames. The only major differences is the absence of the board editor which was removed from Monopoly 3. A PlayStation Portable version was released in 2008.  Gameplay  The game contains very similar gameplay to the board game it is based on, with various physical tasks being replaced by automation and digital representations. It features a 1920s-style theme called Monopoly Song.  Critical reception  Bill Stiteler of AppleLinks.com praised the game's customisation options, and ability to accommodate player-player and player-NPC games, though criticised its computer-animated graphics and voiceovers. Mac Gamer reviewer Danilo Campos thought it was a solid adaption of the board game, but that it didn't make the physical version obsolete. Richard Hallas of Inside Mac Games described the game's graphics as \\"spectacular\\", though noted the AI can sometimes interrupt a human player's move by making trades and offers. Meristation said Monopoly New Edition praised the interface and customisation while describing the artificial intelligence as \\"artificial obstinacy\\". Jeuxvideo.com thought the graphics were \\"simple\\", the gameplay \\"lack[ed] originality\\", its replayability was \\"limited\\", and the music was mostly \\"repetitive\\". Impulse Gamer said it lacked the excitement of the board game and could become quite repetitive. Computer Shopper said the title had the perfect mix of 3D graphics, animation, and sound. Dan Adams of IGN wrote that the game lacked in imagination and creativity. Game Over Online disliked the realistic looking design to the game. Greg Miller of IGN said the PSP version wasn't groundbreaking, but that it was enjoyable and fun. PlayStation LifeStyle thought the game was simple yet fun.

It is released in Japan by Kadokawa on March 4, 2017. Plot Freshman high school student and flute novice Chika Homura wants to reopen her high school's Brass Club, which abruptly closed a year before. However, the principal refuses to give permit unless she manages to gather nine members in three weeks time. Although she is helped by her childhood friend, Haruta Kamijo, who plays the French horn, none of the ex-members seem interested to accept her invitation. Nevertheless, when Chika shows determination while convincing junior Kyoji Miyamoto, a sulky alto saxophone player, to join, members begin to trickle into the club: seniors and couple Seiji Katagiri and Wakaba Noguchi, who play trumpet and oboe, are the first to join, followed by freshmen Megumi Nagatsuka and Taeko Yonezawa, who play trombone and tuba, respectively. Kyoji also decides to sign up after some hesitation. Chika and Haruta attempt to invite senior Naoko Serizawa, a talented clarinet player, next, but she harshly refuses. Instead, Haruta deduces from a local radio station Chika regularly listens to locate Serizawa's close friend, Kaiyu Hiyama, a percussion player. Kaiyu dropped out of school to take his late grandfather's place to run a retirement home, and his departure was what caused the Brass Club's disbandment. Despite some misgivings, he ultimately chooses to return to school and join the club. His entry does favor to the club's fortune: once the team locate clarinet player and junior Kota Tezuka, the ninth member before the deadline, more and more students, many of them ex-members, sign up until the membership swells to 20. Under the tutelage of music teacher Shinjiro Kusakabe, the club trains for the national competition. Because Chika has never played an instrument before, she has the most difficulty integrating and drags the other members back. This briefly causes a rift in the club, although Haruta manages to rally them together to help Chika. Haruta also personally encourages Chika when the latter blames herself upon learning that many members have to sacrifice their private goals to focus on the Brass Club. Chika is further encouraged in her endeavor by Serizawa, whom she befriended after she helped her find her hearing aid. While Serizawa does not sign up, she teaches Chika how to play a difficult note. During the competition, Chika fails her part and the team loses as a result. Disheartened, she temporarily leaves the club. To instill her spirit back, Haruta arranges for the Brass Club to play the score used for the competition, \\"Spring Light, Summer Wind\\". At the last second, Chika joins and, following two failed attempts, manages to get her part right.

Etymology and origins Postures in Niels Bukh's 1924 Primary Gymnastics resembling Parighasana, Parsvottanasana, and Navasana, supporting the suggestion that Krishnamacharya derived some of his asanas from the gymnastics culture of his time The name of the pose is from the Sanskrit परिघासन Parighāsana, in turn from परिघ parigha, meaning \\"gate\\" or \\"crossbar\\", and आस āsana, meaning \\"seat\\" or \\"pose\\". The asana is not known before the 20th century. Since, as yoga scholar Mark Singleton writes, it closely resembles a pose used in modern gymnastics, such as Niels Bukh's 1924 Primary Gymnastics, it is likely that Krishnamacharya derived the asana from the general gymnastics culture of his time; there is no suggestion that he copied it directly from Bukh. Description The pose is entered from an upright kneeling position. One leg is stretched straight out to the side, the arms are stretched out sideways, and the body is extended to the side of the outstretched leg until the arm lies along the leg. The other arm may be stretched up alongside the head, and the hand may eventually lie on top of the other hand and foot. Variations Beginners may work in the pose with the ball of the foot of the straight leg supported on a folded blanket or sandbag, or by pressing the foot against a wall. Practitioners with a knee injury may work in the pose sitting on a chair, with one leg stretched out to the side.

Early life and family Anthony Pillai was born on 27 April 1914 in Jaffna in northern Ceylon. He was the son of S. Anthony Pillai. His family were Roman Catholics whose ancestors came from Tirunelveli District in India. Anthony Pillai was educated at St. Patrick's College, Jaffna. After school he studied history at the Ceylon University College. He later studied at King's College London where he was a member of the India League and a Marxist study group of Ceylonese students. Anthony Pillai married to Caroline Gunawardena, daughter of Don Jacolis Rupasinghe Gunawardena, in 1939. They had four sons (Mahendran, Ranjit, Nalin Ranjan and Suresh Kumar). Career Anthony Pillai was one of the founding members of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) in 1935. He rejoined the LSSP after returning to Ceylon from the UK in 1938. The LSSP leadership had high hopes about Tony, as he was known, but as he could not speak Sinhala, the main language of Ceylon, LSSP leader Philip Gunawardena suggested that he get lessons from his sister Caroline. The pair fell in love and married. The LSSP sent Anthony Pillai and Caroline to Nawalapitiya to organise Indian Tamil estate workers a LSSP union. This was dangerous work as the British plantation owners were known to use violence to suppress unions. When World War II broke out in September 1939 the LSSP opposed the \\"second imperialist war\\". The LSSP played a major role in a wave of strikes in 1939/40 and consequently it was proscribed in 1940 and its leaders Colvin R. de Silva, Philip Gunawardena, N. M. Perera and Edmund Samarakkody arrested in June 1940. However, Anthony Pillai, Caroline and her brother Robert Gunawardena continued to organise strikes by bus, harbour and granary workers during 1940-41. In April 1942 the four LSSP leaders, aided by sympathetic prison guards, escaped from prison and whilst de Silva, Philip Gunawardena and Perera fled to India Samarakkody went into hiding in Ceylon. In July 1942 the bulk of LSSP members, including Anthony Pillai, clandestinely crossed over to India in fishing boats. Whilst most went to Bombay, Anthony Pillai and a few other LSSP members went to Madurai where they joined the Bolshevik–Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI). Anthony Pillai was a member of the BLPI's central committee from 1944 to 1948. When the Quit India Movement began in August 1942 Anthony Pillai and other BLPI members led the movement in Madurai. Anthony Pillai moved to Madras in 1943 and, after the Quit India Movement had quietened, sent for Caroline and their two sons. He became leader of the Madras Labour Union in 1944. Anthony Pillai, his family and several Ceylonese BLPI members, including some who had fled Bombay, were living in a large, two- storey house at the Venus Colony in Teynampe. The group were still wanted by the police and as a result Anthony Pillai was living in disguise. Realising that this environment wasn't conducive to bring up a family, Caroline and their two sons returned to Ceylon. Anthony Pillai and other BLPI members then sought refuge in an outhouse behind Ambi’s Café but in 1944 they were recognised. The police arrested everyone at the refuge and Anthony Pillai and another Ceylonese BLPI member were sentenced to two years’ rigorous imprisonment for \\"possessing seditious literature\\". After being released from Alipuram in 1946 Anthony Pillai returned to Ceylon. However, shortly afterwards the family returned to India when Anthony Pillai was invited back to take over the leadership of the Madras Labour Union (MLU). In early 1947 the MLU started preparing for strikes at the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills. As a result, Anthony Pillai was arrested on 10 March 1947 on government orders. Tens of thousands of workers took part in hartals and demonstrations demanding the release of Anthony Pillai and other union leaders. The government, fearing that workers may try to free Anthony Pillai, transferred him to a prison in remote Andhra. The MLU was banned on 9 June 1947, its assets seized and members arrested. The MLU was forced to abandon the strikes at the mills. Anthony Pillai served as the union's president from 1946 to 75 and also in 1983. He was a member of the All India Trade Union Congress' general council and the Workers' United Front's executive committee in 1947. He founded the Indian Overseas Bank Employees' Union in 1948 and served as its president. He was elected president of the Madras Port Trust Employees' Union in 1948. He was general-secretary and vice president of the All India Port and Dock Workers' Federation until 2000. He was president of the All India Transport Workers' Union, vice president of the Hind Mazdoor Sabha (1952 and 1960–74) and president of the Tamil Nadu Council of Hind Mazdoor Sabha (1957 and 1968). He was a trustee of the Chennai Port Trust from 1954 to 2000. He led several strikes at the Port of Madras. Anthony Pillai is believed to have led over 200 unions during his lifetime. In 1948 the BLPI merged into the Socialist Party (SP) and Anthony Pillai joined the SP. He was a member of the Madras Municipal Corporation between 1948 and 1959. Anthony Pillai led the opposition to the SP's merger with the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party, founding the breakaway Socialist Party (Loyalists) in 1952. Anthony Pillai represented Choolai in the Madras State Legislative Assembly between 1952 and 1957. He joined the Socialist Party (Lohia) in 1956. He represented Madras North in the Lok Sabha between 1957 and 1962. Anthony Pillai then formed the SLP which merged into the Tamil National Party (TNP) in 1961. In 1964 the TNP merged into the Indian National Congress (INC) and Anthony Pillai joined the INC. Anthony Pillai tried unsuccessfully to regain the Madras North at the 1967 Indian general election. When the INC split Anthony Pillai joined K. Kamaraj's Indian National Congress (Organisation). Anthony Pillai died on 16 August 2000 of cardiac arrest at a private hospital in Chennai, India.

The company was founded in 1983 as a new line of commercial furniture under Bernhardt Furniture Company. Bernhardt Design is known for working with a wide variety of international designers and for their investment in programs supporting young designers and students. They sponsor an interdisciplinary course with Art Center College of Design students that allows students the opportunity for their designs to go into production. Bernhardt Design also sponsors ICFF Studio, a yearly scholarship program that gives young designers exposure at the ICFF Furniture Fair in New York City. History Bernhardt Furniture Company was founded in 1889 by John M. Bernhardt. Orphaned at 13, John Bernhardt left for Oregon to become a government surveyor but returned home three years later to pursue a career as a logger and timber cutter. After buying a sawmill, he saw an opportunity to use timber in the manufacture of sturdy oak bedroom furniture. The company he started quickly found a market in such urban centers as Chicago and New York City. As the business grew under the leadership of the Bernhardt family, new product categories, dining room and living room furniture were added and additional facilities were built or purchased from other furniture manufacturers. Until the 1980s, the company was vertically integrated, having a veneer mill, lumber yard and numerous kilns as well as adhesives and particleboard plants. By 1981, Bernhardt began sourcing globally and now has offices in four Asian countries, staffed with 50 employees. The company still has a significant manufacturing operation in western North Carolina, with 12 facilities and 1500 employees. In 1983, Bernhardt Furniture added a line of commercial furniture, Bernhardt Design which offers conservatively styled casegoods, conference and occasional tables, guest, lounge and wood guest chairs. Gradually, the product line expanded, adding more contemporary products and multi-purpose tables and seating and conference chairs. In order to encourage student designers to make their products suitable for mass markets, Bernhardt Design sponsors an interdisciplinary course with the world-renowned Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Selected students in program have their products in the standard product line.

With the elder Kendal graduating from the junior ranks, Stuart formed his own junior team for the next season with himself skipping, teammates Scott Babin, Alex MacNeil and Paul Weingartshofer. The team won the 2012 provincial junior title and represented Nova Scotia at the 2012 Canadian Junior Curling Championships. Thompson led his rink to a 9-3 round robin record, tied for third with Manitoba. This put the team in a tiebreaker game for the final playoff spot, which they would lose. For the next season, Thompson continued as skip for his team, adding Luke Saunders to the rink, replacing Weingartshofer. The team would win the 2013 provincial junior championship and again represented Nova Scotia at that year's Canadian Juniors. There, the team finished with an 8-2 round robin record, good enough for second place. However, the team would lose in the semifinal against Manitoba's Matt Dunstone, settling for a bronze medal. Thompson also played with his brother on the Saint Mary's University curling team. The team would finish with a 3-4 record at the 2011 CIS/CCA Curling Championships. =Men's= After juniors, Thompson was picked up to play third for former Brier champion Mark Dacey.

Later in the season, the team again played in the Nova Scotia men's championship, the 2015 Clearwater Men's Provincial Championship. The team had less luck, placing fourth. After the season, Thompson left the Dacey rink to form his own team as skip, with teammates Colten Steele, Travis Colter, and Alex MacNeil. Thompson and his new team found success on the World Curling Tour, winning two events in 2015, the Bud Light Men's Cashspiel and the Spitfire Arms Cash Spiel.

Built in 1899, it houses the city offices, and its upper floors have served for much of the time since its construction as a performing arts venue. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history Barre City Hall stands near the eastern end of the city's commercial business district, on the west side of Vermont City Park, a triangular park formed by North Main, Church, and Washington Streets. It is a four-story brick and stone building with Beaux Arts styling. The main feature of its facade is a three- story recessed arch, flanked by pilasters and topped by a gabled pediment. Within this recess, the main entrance is framed by ironwork and topped by a series of arcaded windows. Above these windows a wrought iron arched balcony spans the arch, whose interior is capped by a large half-round fanlight. The interior of the building houses city offices on the ground floor, and the facilities of the opera house on the upper three floors. with The city hall was built in 1899 to a design by George Adams, a native of Lancaster, New Hampshire. Its theater was used until World War I for all manner of performances, meetings, and lectures, and fell into decline with the advent of motion pictures. Although it was modified to show films, the decline continued, and the theater was closed in 1940. Community support led to the theater's reopening in 1982, and by the 2000s it had been fully restored with updated amenities. It is one of northern New England's best-preserved theatrical spaces of the turn of the 20th century.

History The Fernão Dias Environmental Protection Area was created by state decree 38.925 on 17 July 1997 to protect areas of ecological interest in the basins of the Jaguari, Sapucaí-Mirim and Sapucaí rivers. As well as conserving the landscape and regional culture, the APA aims to preserve the remaining Atlantic Forest fragments and associated wildlife through control over use of natural resources and incentives for regional eco-development. The APA was created under an agreement between the São Paulo and Minas Gerais governments to share environmental management in the border region between the two states. The same agreement covered creation of the Sapucaí Mirim Environmental Protection Area in São Paulo, protecting the headwaters of the Sapucaí River. The APA is part of the Mantiqueira Mosaic of conservation units, established in 2006.

Built in 1909, it is a fine local example of vernacular Richardsonian Romanesque architecture, designed by one of the city's most prominent architects of the period. It was used as a school until the end of 1968, and now houses apartments. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Champlain School building is located in Burlington's South End neighborhood, on the west side of Pine Street opposite the Champlain Elementary School. It is two stories in height and is built of red brick with sandstone trim. It is capped by a hip roof, and rests on a raised rubblestone foundation. Its front facade is sixteen bays wide, with the center eight set in a slightly projecting hip-roofed projection. The outer four bays on each side have windows set in tall recessed panels, topped by rounded arches; the upper windows are rounded to fit in those arches. The window bays in the center section are narrower, with the upper windows again topped by rounded arches. On the first floor, the main entrance occupies the center four bays, recessed in a large round-arch opening. with The school was built in 1909, and was the first large-scale commission of Frank Lyman Austin, one of Burlington's leading architects of the early 20th century. It was built to satisfy the then-current ideas about the fireproofing of school buildings, and the need for each classroom to have adequate natural lighting. The neighborhood it served had in the 1890s seen significant growth due to the construction of a textile mill. It served the city through 1968, and has since been converted to apartments, with an addition added onto the rear.

Born in Băița, Maramureș County, then part of Austria-Hungary, his parents were Ion Șugar, a miner, and his wife Floarea (née Griga). He was the first of six sons, and from age seven to ten was obliged to work in gold mining to help support the poor family.Șiugariu, p. 5 Following the union of Transylvania with Romania, he attended primary school in his native village and in Valea Borcutului, finishing in 1928. He then went to the normal school in Oradea from 1928 to 1932 and to the city's Emanuil Gojdu High School from 1932 to 1936. There, he was mentored by Octav Șuluțiu, who introduced him to the Familia circle. From 1937 to 1942, he attended the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University, graduating with a thesis on the journalistic aspect of modern literature. His later university years coincided with Romania's participation in World War II, and Șiugariu was briefly called up twice during this period. In July 1942, he obtained a passport and crossed into Hungarian-occupied Northern Transylvania, seeing his parents for the last time in Băița. Considered undesirable by the temporary authorities due to his political stance, he had to take a 12 km walk daily to the gendarmes' post for visa purposes. He attempted a second trip later that year, but was denied approval.Șiugariu, p. 10 In January 1943, he became a reserve officer and was sent to Ploiești for training, then to an infantry regiment in Bacău, in the Moldavia region. That July, during a two-week leave, he married pharmacy student Lucia Stroescu in Râmnicu Vâlcea.Șiugariu, p. 11 In 1944, after the King Michael Coup, he participated in the Romanian Army's push into Central Europe, reaching the Czechoslovak Front. He was killed in early 1945 during the battle for the Slovak town of Brezno. The same year, he was posthumously decorated with the Order of the Crown. Devastated by the news, his 56-year-old father died of double pneumonia a month after his son.Șiugariu, p. 13 In 1956, he was reburied in the Romanian military cemetery at Zvolen. Șiugariu's first published work was \\"Imnul tinereții\\", a poem that appeared in the Beiuș magazine Observatorul in 1934. His first book was the 1938 poetry volume Trecere prin alba poartă, followed by two other collections: Paradisul peregrinar (1942) and Țara de foc (1943). He contributed critical commentary and poems to the magazines Familia, Universul literar, Gând românesc, Pagini literare, Gândirea and Vremea. Carnetele unui poet căzut în război was published in 1968 through the efforts of Laurențiu Fulga. This was a diary in epistolary form, written with a lucidity reminiscent of Camil Petrescu. The book also contains a set of previously unpublished poems.

Douglas was imported from Brazil to Sweden in 1967, three years before starring in the movie. Douglas was capable of singing and of speaking a few dozen words in Swedish. Later life In 2002, 32 years after Pippi in the South Seas, Douglas garnered much attention in the Swedish press when authorities were considering putting him to death because his owner did not have the proper paperwork. A petition pleading for Douglas's life received over 50,000 signatures, including that of actress Inger Nilsson, who played Pippi in the 1970 movie. Ultimately Douglas was spared after his first owner in Sweden produced the correct paperwork, showing that Douglas had been legally imported from Brazil in 1967.Sigrid Harms: Papagei aus „Pippi Langstrumpf“: Douglas muss sterben.

Der Tagesspiegel, 14 April 2016 (German) In 2005, Douglas was moved to a small tropical zoo in Malmö where he lived with a female blue-and-yellow macaw called Gojan. In early 2016, Douglas once more attracted the attention of the Swedish (and later German) media when authorities once again had plans to put Douglas to death, this time because his three-square-meter cage was too small and prohibited Douglas from flying. The authorities requested an aviary of at least 30 square meters, which the zoo could not provide, but zoo director Frank Madsen argued that the 49-year-old Douglas was incapable of flying anyway and that there was no sense in cutting the parrot's remaining years short. With the authorities unwilling to grant an exception, Madsen turned to the press and soon received more than 100 offers for a new home for Douglas and Gojan. Ultimately the Karlsruhe Zoo in Germany was selected and in April, Madsen himself delivered Douglas and Gojan to Karlsruhe, where they were greeted with a public welcome party.Pippis Papagei.

The original CX10 was released with the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed the Atari 2600) in 1977 and became the primary input device for most games on the platform. The CX10 was replaced after a year by the simpler and less expensive CX40. The addition of the Atari joystick port to other platforms cemented its popularity. It was the standard for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers and was compatible with the VIC-20, Commodore 64 and 128, MSX, and later the Atari ST and Amiga. Third-party adapters allowed it to be used on other systems, such as the Apple II and the ZX Spectrum. The CX40 was so popular during its run that it became as iconic to Atari as the company's \\"Fuji\\" logo; it remains a common staple in video game iconography to this day, and is commonly referred to as the symbol of 1980s video game system design. The CX40 has been called \\"the pinnacle of home entertainment controllers in its day\\", and remains a staple of industrial design discussions. The CX40 had several well-known problems and was subject to eventual mechanical breakdown. A number of more robust third-party alternatives were available in a thriving market, but generally at much higher prices so they never achieved widespread popularity in comparison to the CX40. The Atari-style joystick declined in popularity as games relied on multiple buttons for gameplay. The Nintendo Entertainment System controller includes two buttons, the Sega Genesis has three. Atari's own Atari 7800 shipped with two-button controllers as well. Description An exploded view of the Atari CX40 joystick shows its basic construction. The top lid is not shown in this diagram. When the stick is moved, one side of the hemisphere (right) moves down to press on the buttons while the opposite side is forced upward (left) to provide a recentering force. The Atari joystick works by connecting the ground pin to one of several pins in the Atari joystick port, thereby dropping the voltage on that pin and creating a signal that can be noticed by a controller in the computer. For this reason, Atari-style joysticks are sometimes referred to as \\"digital joysticks\\", largely to differentiate them from the analog joysticks found on systems like the Apple II and IBM PC. The main structure of the CX40 is formed from a concave moulded thermoplastic base with a separate flat lid that covers the opening on the top of the base. Four cylindrical protrusions on the inside of the base hold a printed circuit board (PCB) above the bottom, roughly centered vertically. A conical post on the base passes vertically through a hole in the middle of the PCB. The PCB has five membrane switches mounted on top. Four of the switches are arranged in a cross pattern around the hole in the middle of the PCB; the fifth is offset near one of the corners. The PCB connects the switches to pins in the 9-pin D-connector that lead to the console via a cutout in the upper right corner of the base. The cutout is shaped to grip a moulded strain relief on the cable. The stick itself is a moulded polypropylene form consisting of a hollow vertical cylinder with a hemispherical dome at one end. The stick is placed on top of the conical post in the base, and the lid is placed over it. This clamps the stick between the post and the circular cutout in the lid. When pressure is applied to move the stick, it can rotate on the post by sliding the hemisphere within the circular cutout. The hemisphere has four small \\"fingers\\" at the bottom, which are positioned to lie over the switches on the PCB. Cutouts in the hemisphere make the fingers mechanically separate from the main section of the stick, allowing them to flex so they do not press too hard on the switches. When the stick is moved, the hemisphere rotates on its support post, bringing the fingers down to press on the appropriate buttons. At the same time, the opposite side of the hemisphere rises, where it comes into contact with short protrusions on the lid. These push down on the flexible section of the hemisphere, providing a centering force that returns the stick to the upright position when pressure is released. The stick is assembled by placing the PCB within the lower case and routing the cable out of the box. The stick is then placed on top of the post, and a flexible rubbery cover is placed over the stick. A red plastic button is placed over the fifth switch, providing the fire button; and the top lid is then placed on top of the entire assembly. Four machine screws inserted from the bottom of the case through the PCB support protrusions hold the lid on, holding everything in place through compression. Although the stick can be pressed in any direction, the four fingers on the hemisphere allow only two switches to be pressed at a time. This allows a total of eight directions: four for up, down, left. and right, and four more for combinations of neighboring switches: up-left, up-right, down-left, and down-right. The physical movement on the post prevents non-neighbouring switches from being pressed; one can not press up and down at the same time, for instance. The base and its cover are moulded with some roughness in the plastic. The portion directly around the stick and the fire button are smooth. Just around the opening for the stick are a series of rectangular embossings with the four cardinal directions indicated by small wedge shapes. The 12 o'clock position replaces the wedges with the word \\"TOP\\". These markings are all painted orange, but this tends to wear off over time. Problems Right-handed users would normally hold the stick in their left hand by gripping the left side of the case with their thumb over the fire button, and fingers wrapped around the left side and bottom, while their right hand operated the stick. Some games allowed the stick to be rotated for left- handed users, or this could be done with some minor re-wiring. The ergonomics of the base and the need to hold it while pressing the fire button led to fatigue of the left thumb that became known as \\"joystick thumb\\". This was especially common in games that required the user to fire repeatedly or hold down the button for long periods, like Eastern Front (1941). This led to various \\"autofire\\" attachments, available as do-it-yourself plans, pre- assembled, or as parts of 3rd party sticks. These simulated rapid presses of the fire button as long as the button on the stick was held down. Small rubbery pads on the bottom allowed for stick placement on a desktop. However, the torque needed to operate the internal switches was more than enough to flip over the lightweight stick. Some 3rd party replacements used a much larger base and/or a shorter vertical stick so the torque was reduced. Generally those with bases large enough for one-handed use tended to be too large to use two-handed. Modifications using suction cups, also found on some 3rd party sticks, were generally regarded as more trouble than they were worth. The CX40 was infamous for its eventual breakdown from one of two problems. One was that the control ring on the bottom of the stick moulding was not very robust, and either the ring itself or the four small tabs that connected it to the stick could be broken by applying too much force. The ring transmitted the force from the stick to the switches, so if it broke, the stick would no longer operate properly in that direction. This happened with \\"distressing regularity\\". The other problem was that the switches themselves would eventually wear out due to repeated use, normally with the top membrane cracking or the tape holding it in place wearing off. A common modification was to replace the switches with miniature snap-action switches (microswitches). Some of these, however, have the problem that their actuation is non-linear; they require considerable force to start moving compared to the force needed to complete the motion. When used in an otherwise unmodified CX40, this caused it to be more difficult to move along the diagonals, as one of the two switches being pushed would normally reach the threshold first, causing motion in that direction while the other was not yet pressed. In games that required fine control, like Jumpman, these solutions were generally unsuitable. Newer switches improve this action. Versions =CX10= The original CX10 version was designed by Steve Bristow for the 2600 and produced only for a single year. Many of these had the word \\"ATARI\\" printed in white letters on a thin metal plate at the very top of the stick. Internally, the CX10 differed from the CX40 primarily in the switch mechanisms. In the CX10, a thin plastic plate was placed directly on top of the PCB, separated by a few millimetres. Cup-shaped protrusions on the top surface held a small metal spring, and opposite these on the bottom surface of the plate was a small metal bar. The plate was positioned so the bars on the bottom of the cups were positioned over similar bars on the PCB, although aligned perpendicularly. Slits cut into the plate on either side of the cup made that section of the plate flexible. When the stick was moved, it pressed on the spring, eventually providing enough force to bend that section of the plate down until the two metal bars made contact. The springs provided the recentering force. This operation required more physical motion to depress the switches than on the CX40, and the CX10 is generally considered to be less suitable for gaming. =CX40= The CX40 changed colour to match the Atari XE series. The CX40 was designed by James Asher to replace the CX10, with the aim of greatly improving its ability to be inexpensively mass-produced. This model accounts for the vast majority of Atari's production run. By 1983, one out of every five American homes had one. The CX40 is nearly identical to the CX10 externally, but lacks the printing on the top of the stick, and replaced the uppermost wedge in the ring of embossing with the word \\"TOP\\". By 1986 the CX40 was difficult to obtain, and some dealers could only order it with software. A new CX40 using gray colored plastic for the base was released with the Atari XEGS computer. It also dispensed with the orange paint on the embossing on the base. It was otherwise identical to the earlier CX40, retaining the black plastic cover on the stick and the red fire button. =Other joysticks from Atari= The CX40 remained popular throughout the run of the 2600 and Atari 8-bit family machines, but by the end of their run many 3rd party improvements had appeared and Atari introduced new controllers of their own. Released in the summer of 1983, the CX842 \\"Remote Control Wireless Joystick\\" was a rebranded version of the Cynex Game Mate 2. These were essentially CX40's on top of a radio device powered by D cells, so the bases were quite large as a result. A separate receiver box completes the connection to the console. Atari also advertised the CX43 \\"Space Age Joystick\\", the most radical change to the basic concept. This was essentially a very small version of the CX40 mounted on top of a trigger-style handle with a fire button on the front. The handle was intended to be held in one hand while the other operated the very short stick on top. The CX43 may be a rebranded version of the Milton Bradley HD2000, which was never released. The Atari 7800's CX-24 Pro-Line joystick was designed to be backward compatible with the 2600 and its games. The Pro-Line was originally advertised specifically for the 2600 in 1983, but was not released until it was made the pack-in controller for the 7800. Its right fire button was designed to switch between functioning as a discrete button for 7800 games, and as a duplicate of the left fire button (which was functionally identical to the CX-40's lone fire button) for 2600 games. The Atari CX-78 Joypad, available in PAL markets in place of the CX-24, had the same compatibility as the Pro-Line stick. 3rd party alternatives The Commodore VC1311 was introduced after their clone of the CX40 was ordered off the market. The CX40 was the only model in widespread use until about 1981, when the introduction of Space Invaders on the 2600 quadrupled that platform's sales. This led to a thriving 3rd party market for better sticks for use on the 2600. Many were almost identical copies of the CX40. Other examples of barely-modified sticks include the Gemini GemStick, which was essentially a CX40 with a somewhat larger base and the fire button replaced by a larger yellow version. The Gemstick 2 added a second button in the upper right. The Suncom Slik-Stik was slightly more modified with the case rounded off and a large red plastic ball at the tip of a shortened stick. The shorter stick made it more suitable for single-handed use. Suncom later introduced the TAC-2, essentially a larger Slik-Stik with buttons on both sides, for left-handed users. For the VIC-20, Commodore International introduced a joystick that was essentially identical to the Atari model with the exception that the top plate on the base was white instead of black. This prompted Atari to sue for patent violations. Commodore responded by introducing the 1311, a modified version that made the case more rectangular, changed the stick from a cylinder to a triangle, and replaced the single round fire button with a larger one running across the top of the stick, making it suitable for use in either hand. These changes also rendered it painful to use and it was widely panned. Happ's Competition Pro used microswitches in place of Atari's membrane switches. The stick (red) presses on the switch actuators (white part on blue components). The Wico Command Control was one of the earliest examples of a stick that differed radically from the Atari pattern in mechanical terms. Wico was a major supplier of arcade game joysticks and adapted these mechanisms for home use. These replaced the membrane switches with leaf switches that were much more robust and provided the reentering force internally. A large rounded- corner square block of plastic provided the moving surface similar to the hemisphere in the CX40, but was shaped to provide more obvious directions when pressed, sliding along the edges of the square. The stick, a steel tube covered in a bat-like red plastic moulding, featured a button on top that pressed a shaft running through the center of the stick to another switch below the main assembly. The base was greatly enlarged with the specific intent of making it useful in one-handed play, which operated in concert with the stick-top button. A switch on the base selected whether the button on the handle or the base was active. The case also featured moulded indents in the bottom that made it easier to hold in two-hand use. The result was a system that was significantly more robust than the Atari sticks, but also much more complex and expensive. Later versions added a switch for \\"autofire\\" that caused the fire button to be repeatedly pressed while held down, and even later the bat-like handle was replaced by a ball like those found in the arcade. It was consistently rated very highly. The Epyx 500XJ was a radical restyling of the basic CX40 concept. This version, for the NES, has additional buttons. The Epyx 500XJ was among a very few designs that broke from the Atari mould completely. Like the Competition Pro, the 500XJ's mechanism was based around a steel shaft pressing on microswitches and offered a similar feel. Unlike the Command Control, the 500XJ's shaft pressed directly on the switches, making it harder to press into the diagonals. More importantly, the base of the unit was completely changed, consisting of a moulded form that was designed to be easily gripped by the left hand with the index finger naturally positioned over a fire button located on the bottom right side of the case. Both robust and unique, the 500XJ garnered widespread praise and was the only other joystick of the era to achieve widespread popularity to the point of becoming a standard of sorts. Early gamepads were essentially CX40s with the base exposed to the user and the joystick on top removed. Sega's Master System and Genesis/Mega Drive controllers are compatible with the 2600, although the console can only read one fire button on the Sega controllers – the 2 button on Master System controllers, and the B button on Genesis controllers. The Sega Control Stick was the only Sega-made controller actually marketed for its compatibility with Atari and Commodore systems. Due to the unique setup of the 7800's fire buttons, Sega controllers are not compatible with 7800 games that require two fire buttons, although they can be used with 7800 games that only use one fire button. Atari joysticks on other platforms The Atari joystick was so popular that adaptors for its standard of connector were available for platforms like the Apple II and IBM PC. There were even factory modified CX40s, notably the Trisstick from Big Five Software, that placed the converter electronics inside the CX40 case and replaced the cable with one suitable for the TRS-80. While its single-button configuration makes it unsuitable for general use with Sega's consoles, an Atari joystick can be used in the player two port for certain two-player games with minimal controls, so long as a standard Sega controller is plugged into the player one port. For example, a CX-40 can be used to control Tails in two-player mode in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, as all three Genesis fire buttons are mapped to the same jump/spin-dash function (and with the Master System for the 1 and 2 buttons), although player two cannot pause the game due to the absence of a Start button.

Following the relaxation of the Penal Laws, it became possible for Catholic adherents to consider the construction of additional churches and to repair the existing stock of religious buildings. Church authorities used the opportunity to implement the Tridentine reforms which saw the parish as the basic unit of ecclesiastical organisation and the parish priest as the central figure within the parish.Cronin, Elizabeth, Fr Michael Dungan's Blanchardstown, 1836-1968, Four Courts Press (2002), p.10. The new parish priest of Blanchardstown in 1839, Fr Michael Dungan, oversaw the construction of a number of new churches, which are today independent parishes in their own right, and invited a number of religious communities to provide for the education of Catholic children. St Brigid's Church, Blanchardstown – not to be confused with a church of the Church of Ireland in nearby Castleknock – was constructed in 1837 upon the foundation of a church that had been built prior to 1731. It is the Mother church of 12 other churches, among them this parish, that were constituted out of St. Brigid's over the following 156 years.Cronin, Elizabeth, Fr Michael Dungan's Blanchardstown, 1836-1968, Four Courts Press (2002), p.56. Parish church The Church is a 600-seater community designed church with a welcoming courtyard. It was designed by Joseph Kennedy of Edward N. Smith & KennedyOfficial website - - Smith Kennedy and built by Matthew Wallace, Builders, Wellingtonbridge, County Wexford. The design was consciously low key with an emphasis on integration into the community. The foundation stone was laid on 21 February 1993 by Desmond, Cardinal Connell, Archbishop of Dublin. The church was opened on 6 June 1993. As well as the church proper, it features a Day Chapel/Community Room with a Parish Office and Sacristy. Behind the altar is an eight-foot high triple stained glass window from the Harry Clarke studio. It depicts the Immaculate Conception and was donated to the parish by the Dominican Sisters in Dún Laoghaire when sadly their convent there closed down.Official website - Dominicans, Dún Laoghaire] - It was restored and built into the new church and care was taken to preserve it for the future. Another notable feature is the white marble carving that depicts Our Lady giving the Rosary to Ss Catherine and Dominic. This was also donated by the Dominican Sisters. It was carved in the late 19th century by Padraig and Willie Pearse's father in his stoneworks at \\"Great Brunswick Street\\" (or Pearse Street as it is currently known).

He studied languages at Princeton University and in his leisure time pursued the twin activities of stage magic and folk song collecting. After his third year at Princeton he visited Nova Scotia where he performed magic shows and collected over 60 songs that formed the basis of his 1931 Princeton thesis \\"Shantymen and Shantyboys\\", later the title of his major published folksong collection. After leaving Princeton he initially gained employment as a social worker, undertook graduate studies at Harvard, contributed book reviews to the Saturday Review of Literature, and eventually found work in publishing, where he spent the remainder of his career, interrupted for a period during the Second World War when he worked in North Africa and Italy with the Office of War Information in the area of in psychological warfare. During his career as an editor for E.P. Dutton and Macmillan Publishing he assisted a wide range of authors including Sir Edmund Hillary, Françoise Sagan and Woody Guthrie whose autobiography Bound for Glory was edited/\\"organized\\" by Doerflinger's first wife, Joy (Homer), and published in 1943.Robert Santelli, \\"This Land Is Your Land: Woody Guthrie and the Journey of an American Folk Song\\" Running Press, 2012 After his first wife's death in 1946 at the age of only 31, he eventually remarried to her sister, the writer Anne Homer, the couple going on to have a further four children, among them the historian Thomas Main \\"Tom\\" Doerflinger (1952–2015), in addition to a daughter from his first marriage. Other than his collecting trips in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and New England, he collected a number of his songs from residents at Sailors' Snug Harbor on Staten Island, New York, which was set up as a retirement home for destitute sailors. Doerflinger died at age 90 at his home in New Jersey on December 23, 2000, his second wife predeceased him by 5 years. He is commemorated in The William Main Doerflinger Memorial Sea Shanty Sessions at the Noble Maritime Collection at Snug Harbor and a plaque at Staten Island commemorating his contribution to the canon of sea and lumber shanties.

Zorea in 2016 Aharon Wilson Zorea (born March 5, 1969) is a historian specializing in modern social movements, especially related to crime control and contemporary medical issues.  Early life  Aharon Zorea was born Aaron James Alexander Wilson on March 5, 1969 in Houston, Texas the youngest of three children to Barton Taylor Wilson, Jr. and Patricia Anne Wilson (née Forslund). His childhood was marked by frequent travel. Before he was a year old, his family moved from Houston to Anchorage, Alaska and at the age of five they moved to Tacoma, Washington while his father attended law school. Five years later, they moved to Kfar Chabad, Israel and then to Chico, California, before finally settling back in Anchorage, Alaska.  Religious conversion  Much of the family travel was motivated by religious conviction. Zorea's parents converted to Reform Judaism before he was born, but after ten years the entire family transitioned in Chasidic Judaism. In 1980 they legally changed the family name from Wilson to Zorea (which means, “Sower of Seeds”) and then made Aliyah to Israel. They intended to immigrate and remain in the Jewish Holy Land for life. Barton changed his name to Moshe Calberg Zorea, and Patricia changed her name to Rivka Chana Zorea. His two elder brothers also changed their names, from Barton Taylor Wilson III to Avraham Barton Zorea, and from Derek Leeland Wilson to Isaac Derek Zorea. Aaron’s name remained mostly the same with only a spelling change. The family moved to the village of Kfar Chabad in Israel, which is one of the two centers of Chasidism (the other being in Crown Heights, Brooklyn), where Moshe and the two elder brothers attended Yeshiva Ohr Tmimim. Shortly before Zorea’s thirteenth birthday, Moshe Zorea converted to Christianity, and the entire family followed his lead. Less than a year after arriving in Israel, the Zorea family moved back to the United States and maintained the name change. The story of the family’s religious conversion became the subject of many lectures and a forthcoming book.  Education  After several years in Chico, California, the Zorea family moved back to Anchorage, Alaska where his parents and siblings remained. Zorea attended Bartlett High School, and graduated with a B.A. (1987) in History from the University of Alaska, Anchorage. He earned his M.A. (1993) in American Diplomatic History from Purdue University, where he studied under Jon Teaford. After teaching for five years, Zorea attended Saint Louis University and earned his Ph.D. (2005) under Donald Critchlow.  Career  Between earning his M.A. and PhD., Zorea taught at several high schools including Holy Rosary Academy (Anchorage, Alaska) and Interlochen Arts Academy (Michigan). In the fall of 2004, Zorea was hired as Associate Professor at the Richland Campus within the University of Wisconsin Colleges. He attained the rank of full professor in 2014 after publishing his third book and serves in the History Department of the University of Wisconsin - Platteville. In 2008, Zorea founded the Richland Heritage Project, which is a local institute located on the UW-Platteville Richland Campus and which specializes in digitizing and collecting local oral histories. In 2012, he was elected to the Board of Curators for the Wisconsin History Society. Zorea has written numerous books and more than 60 articles and chapters on presidential history and political movements, policy history, local history, and religious/intellectual history. His most recent books include, Birth Control (Health and Medical Issues Today) (Greenwood Press, 2012), Steroids (Health and Medical Issues Today) (Greenwood Press, 2014), Finding the Fountain of Youth: The Science and Controversy Behind Extending Life and Cheating Death (Greenwood Press, 2017), and the soon to be published Marijuana: Your Questions Answered (Greenwood Press, 2021).  Personal life  Aharon Zorea married Debbi Anne Zorea (née Sander) on July 19, 1997 while they were both teaching at Interlochen Arts Academy. They remained married for 17 years and had two children, Jacob Aharon Augustine and Jonah Charles Athanasius.

TEFL originates over 100 years ago in China as part of the Qing Dynasty, in 1862 the first TEFL course was created and in 1901 became part of the Beijing Normal University. A TEFL certificate prepares individuals at all experience levels to instruct students in English in the foreign language classroom. The TEFL online certification process was created in the late 90s when the digital boom started to take off. There are one of various TEFL certificates available. Online TEFL's are usually regulated by governing bodies Qualifi is a recognised awarding body in the UK. In the US AQC is a recognised awarding body of the DEAC. There's 3 types of TEFL qualification levels. No level, Level 3 Online TEFL courses and Level 5 Online TEFL courses. A no level TEFL is a TEFL course where the certificate at the end isn't recognised by an awarding body. This can provide difficulties if applying for visas to teaching in some countries. A level 3 Online TEFL course is usually 120 hours (minimum recognised TEFL qualification), a Level 3 would be the equivalent of a high school diploma. Whereas a level 5 usually 120+ hours to complete is equivalent to a college diploma. The big differences between the three is the entry level pay you get teaching once completed, job opportunities and quality of teaching whilst studying for the online TEFL. The TEFL Online certificate was designed by experts in the field of foreign language teaching from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) within the University of Toronto Faculty of Education.

His initiation in abandoning Dummugudem- Nagarjunasagar Tail Pond project and leaving Ichamapalli project for long term perspective etc. had given right direction to the progress of irrigation in Telangana. He defended big lift irrigation schemes, namely Kaleshwaram and Palamuru Rangareddy projects, for Telangana State as they are inevitable due to geographical and climatic conditions of the state. Advisor's contributions in establishing a firm base for interstate aspects on water front for Telangana will remain remembered forever. In Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal issues or Supreme Court issues he was always the guiding force. He always worked with accommodation and audacity. Without antagonising the Central Government's view of interlinking of rivers, while representing Telangana State at meetings of National Water Development Agency, he advocated for revision of surplus waters available at Ichampalli, keeping the Tribunal Awards and changed technological advancements also in view. He presented that the surplus waters above 50% dependability can be diverted. In response, Ministry of Water Resources has constituted a committee to revise the guidelines to calculate the surplus river waters in the country. Getting the nod from Chief Minister KCR, Advisor Vidyasagar Rao attended the KRMB Meeting in October,2014. It was turning point in the functioning of KRMB. Explaining the relevant Clauses of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014 and supremacy of the Tribunal Award, Vidyasagar Rao could establish that KRMB did not have the powers to allocate the waters on its own. The then Chairman of KRMB accepted the substance of the arguments. Either Bachawat Tribunal Award or agreed quantities by both the States shall only be the basis for distribution of available waters by the Board, whether it is for Krishna Delta, or from NSP and Srisailam Reservoirs. In June, 2015 to avoid any troubles in the coming year 2015-16, Mr Rao played a major role in arriving at an adhoc arrangement, for sharing of Krishna waters, in a temporary ratio of 299 : 512, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh respectively. He was also able to clarify the concept of ‘enbloc’ allocations of the Tribunal which paved way for utilisation of Krishna river waters anywhere in the basin as per requirement. Because of these arrangements, the water sharing for that year happened without any problems. And, in June, 2016, the same arrangement had been extended for this water year 2016-17 also. On the basis of Tribunal Awards, Vidyasagar Rao strongly advocated for rightful share to Telangana State in the waters diverted from Godavari to Krishna River. At Godavari River Management Board meetings also, acumen of Advisor Vidyasagar Rao could stall the Andhra Pradesh intentions of putting control of Major Projects on Godavari River within Telangana State, into the hands of Godavari River Management Board (GRMB). At National Seminar on Minor Irrigation Projects 'Mission Kakatiya' organised by Kakatiya University, Telangana State, in November,2016, Rao was chief guest and addressed the participants and expalained about Government policies on Irrigation Projects.

Early life and marriage His father died at some point in 1506; in November that year, Henry Scrope received livery of his inheritance on 15 November that year. Henry VIII was crowned King of England on 23 June 1509, and at which occasion Henry Scrope was made a Knight Banneret.Cokayne, G.E., The Complete Peerage of England and Wales (Vol. XI, London, 1949), Career He was present at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, and was subsequently summoned to parliament between 1514 and 29. He continued to serve on the border in the early 1520s, being at Newcastle in the company of the earl of Surrey in 1523. He attended to various aspects of royal administration in Yorkshire, including a commission of the peace in 1512, assessing the taxable population ahead of the 1527 subsidy, and was in attendance on the Scottish Queen, Margaret Tudor. He supported King Henry's attempt to divorce Katherine of Aragon, being a signatory to a 13 July 1530 letter from the Lords Spiritual and Temporal to Pope Clement VII, pleading the king's case. In the early 1530s, Scrope was under pressure from Thomas Cromwell to sell his 'Pisho' estate in Hertfordshire to the king, who desired to augment his royal Hunsdon lordship. This manor had been held by the Scrope family since 1393, and Henry Scrope wanted to swap it for other lands rather than sell it for cash, and it seems likely that he bribed Cromwell to reach this end. Scrope had died, however, before negotiations were complete. Marriages Henry Scrope appears to have married, at the age of fourteen, his cousin Alice Scrope (who was aged approximately 12). She was, suo jure, Baroness Scrope of Masham, her father being Thomas Scrope, 6th Lord Scrope of Masham and her mother, Elizabeth, who was a daughter of John Neville, Marquess Montagu. Alice was dead by 1510, and at some point Henry Scrope married a second time. This was to another member of the Yorkshire nobility, Mabel, daughter of Thomas, Lord Dacre of Gisland, herself Baroness Greystoke in own right. Death He died, between October and December 1533, and was buried alongside his ancestors, in Wensley, North Yorkshire. His second wife outlived him, He had had no children by his first marriage, but had three sons by Mabel, the eldest of whom, John, succeeded him to the barony, and who the year after his father died, concluded the Pisho estate negotiations, being 'eventually forced to settle for money rather than land' from the crown.

The NID is a government issued photo ID just like the Bangladeshi Driver's license, which is also a biometric, microchip embedded, smart identity card. The NID is required by Bangladeshi citizens for multiple essential public services, such as obtaining utility connections, as well as private services, such as opening bank accounts, in Bangladesh. Initially paper based laminated NID cards were issued since 2006. Then the paper based laminated NID cards were replaced by biometric and microchip embedded Smart NID cards for all adult citizens in Bangladesh from 2016 onwards. This was done to ensure security for the card holder as well as prevent counterfeiting and fraudulence. The government provides the Smart NID card free of charge to all adult citizens of Bangladesh.nid make History Biometric identification has existed in Bangladesh since 2008. Bangladesh Election Commission introduced paper laminated National Identity cards through its project named Preparation of Electoral Roll with Photograph (PERP), a UNDP led donor funded project. The first National Project Director was Brigadier General Shahadat Hossain Chowdhury, afwc, psc, te. The project was designed for preparation of electoral roll with photographs for the Ninth Parliamentary Election held in December 2008. A demographic and biometric database was created for 81.3 million Bangladeshi citizens who were eligible to be voters. All Bangladeshis who are 18 years of age or older are issued identity cards and included in a central biometric database, which is used by the Bangladesh Election Commission to oversee the electoral procedure in Bangladesh. Before 2016, only normal identity cards were issued which only included the ID holder's name; father's and mother's names; date of birth; ID number; photo; thumb and index fingerprints; and signature. These paper based laminated NID cards were easy to counterfeit. However, starting in October 2016, they were replaced by biometric, microchip embedded, smart identity cards in order to ensure security for the card holder as well as prevent counterfeiting and fraudulence. The smart NID cards include all ten fingerprints in addition to other biometric and identity information. Smart National Identity Card The National Identity Registration Wing (NIDW) of the Bangladesh Election Commission introduced the Smart National Identity Card in October 2016. This card has an integrated circuit embedded in it and it is also known as a \\"chip- based card\\" or \\"smart NID card\\" in Bangladesh. It is a pocket sized plastic card, almost the size of a credit card, with the embedded integrated circuit storing all the data. To maintain the security of the smart card, twenty-five international certifications and standards have been ensured. Since they are machine readable cards, the smart cards have additional safety measures to prevent forgery. The card holders currently receive twenty-two different types of services including banking, electronic Tax Identification Number 63(e-TIN), driving license, passport, etc. Key facilities The following facilities and services are available to citizens with the Bangladeshi smart NID card: * Citizens' rights and benefits * National identity * Driving license * Passport * Property land buying and selling * Open Bangladeshi bank accounts * Account Check * Bank loan support * Government pensions * Government financial aid or support * BIN facility * Share-BO account maintainers * Business trade license * Vehicle registration * Insurance schemes * Marriage registration * E-passports * E-governance * Gas and electricity connections * Mobile connect * Health cards * E-cash * Bank transactions * Students' admission facilities Requirements Updating the list of eligible voters is an ongoing process under the election commission. Bangladeshi citizens who have frequently lived in an area and are 18 years or above, but not yet registered as a voter, may register. At the time of enrollment they need following supporting documents in addition to the application form: * SSC or equivalent certificate * Birth certificate * Passport, driving license, or TIN certificate * Utility bill copy, house rent receipt, or holding tax receipt (as proof of address) * Citizenship certificate (as applicable) * Father, mother, husband, or wife's NID bd photocopy * Recent Color photo with white background.

It was built in 1753 and used by the Congregation of the Most Holy Ecce Homo until 1968, when it was damaged by an earthquake. Extensively restored in 1992, it is now a multi-use venue space. Ecco Homo refers to the suffering of Jesus Christ, as depicted in many religious artworks. A church of the same name stands in Old Jerusalem, commemorating the spot where Pontius Pilate is supposed to have uttered the words.  History  The present Church was built in 1753 on the same spot where there was a chapel called the Crocifissello (small Crucifix), close to the western town walls. As it was very small, the members of the Congregation asked the municipality for the authorization to have the chapel's courtyard in order to build a larger Church there. The construction started in 1753 and was completed the following year; the building was closed to service because of the 1968 Belice earthquake. In 1986, the Monuments and Fine Arts Department of Trapani decided on the first restoration work including the consolidation of the Church, the vault and the roof. Later, in 1992 the Department completed the works by repairing the stuccoes, replacing the frames the gilt work, and repainted the Church. Today the Church of the Most Holy Ecce Homo is no longer a temple but a monument rescued from decay. It is now used as an auditorium and as a meeting place for cultural events.  Description and works  The church has a simple portal, surmounted by a niche where you can see a marble alto-rilievo panel representing Ecce Homo.Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.62, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982. There is one circular nave, similar to that one in the Saints Cosma and Damiano's Church, with beautiful Settecento stucco decorations on the vault; it has an hemispheric shape, with four webs surmounting the windows ending on masonry pillars. Inside the webs there are represented the prophecy of the Passion, the Flagellation, the Calvary and the Risen's Cross; in the middle of the vault there are the Holy Ghost, as a dove, and the Bible. There are three altars and these works: *Ecce Homo, a wooden statue on the high altar *A wooden Crucifix, on the left altar *Saint Francis of Paola: a recent statue on the right altar *Organ with its choir, settled above the entrance opposite the high altar.  The Congregation  The Congregation of the Most Holy Ecce Homo, founded at about 1750 by canonico Don Vincenzo Fiderico, Chapelain of the Hospital Santo Spirito e San Vito and its first Rector, was formed by butchers and other merchants, who, owing to their working hours, were used to meet on Friday night in this Church for their spiritual meetings. After having been hosted in other churches, in 1753 the bishop of Mazara del Vallo, after some pressing requests made by Congregation, gave them the Church of the Crocifissello, in the district of Chiesa Madre and adjoining a courtyard limited by the old town walls and some houses. The main scopes were these: * To promote the greater glory of God the Father and of the Holy Church, the sinners’ conversion and the end of blasfemies. * To devote oneself to spiritual works and to the Most Holy Ecce Homo * To take action for the reform of one's habits, by giving other people the good example of Christian life and maintaining the spirit of charity towards everybody, because this is the bond which connects us to God.Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.89-90, Alcamo, Campo, 2001. These people were excluded: *All women *Noblemen or teachers or dignitaries of any kind *Immoral, irreligious and ed heretical people *The people condemned for public or private crimes or guilty of illegal purchase of Church property *Dissolute or scandalous people, such as concubines, adulterers, blasphemers, violators of festivities. The feast was celebrated on the first Friday of March and it was preceded by a week of spiritual exercises and followed by the Forty Hours Devotion. During the rites and processions, the members of the congregation wore a cloth scapular with two violet ribbons at their ends: one side, with the image of Ecce Homo, was hanging on their chest, and the other, behind their shoulders, had the embroidery of a crown made by thorns and three nails inside it. The Congregation existed until 1968, when the Belice earthquake damaged its structure remarkably and the Church was unfit for use..

Preparation  Racemic 2-ethylhexyl acrylate can be prepared with a high yield by esterification of acrylic acid with racemic 2-ethylhexanol in the presence of hydroquinone as a polymerization inhibitor and a strong acid such as methanesulfonic acid by reactive distillation using toluene as an azeotroping agent.  Properties  2-Ethylhexyl acrylate polymerizes easily. The polymerization can be initiated by light, peroxides, heat, or contaminants. It can react violently when combined with strong oxidants and can form explosive mixtures with air at temperatures above . The chemical, physical, and toxicological properties, however, can be greatly modified by additives or stabilizers.  Use  2-Ethylhexyl acrylate and butyl acrylate are the major base monomers for the preparation of acrylate adhesives. 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate can react by free-radical polymerization to form macromolecules having a molecular weight of up to 200,000 g/mol. Other monomers such as vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, and styrene may be copolymerized to modify the properties of the resulting polymer.Bodo Müller, Walter Rath, Walter Rath: Formulierung von Kleb- und Dichtstoffen. 1.

Bio Walker got her start on television with a role on the ITV series No Hiding Place in 1964. Eventually, Walker began to secure regular episodic work, appearing most often on dramas and comedies, including Father Brown, The Prince and the Pauper, Anna Karenina, Yes Minister, and Wyatt's Watchdogs. She also appeared in episodes The Two Ronnies, the BBC comedy show, from 1973–1984. =Doctor Whos Sarah Jane Smith= In 1973, the long-running television series Doctor Who was looking for a new companion for the star character. After auditioning many women, producer Barry Letts selected April Walker for the role of Sarah Jane Smith. Unfortunately, the actor playing the Doctor, Jon Pertwee, disliked the selection, in part because he was not comfortable with a female co-star who was so tall. Already contractually protected, Walker was paid for the entire season but not actually used, the role being re-cast to Elisabeth Sladen. Sladen and a handful of others kept the secret of whom she had replaced, taking it literally to their graves. But when David Brunt was compiling a Doctor Who DVD, he came across a BBC memo that revealed Walker as the mysterious first Sarah Jane Smith. When Walker gave her first interview regarding her casting in Doctor Who, she also revealed that at more-or-less the same time, she was cast as Jutta Baumgarten, Terry Collier's estranged wife in Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?: the intention being that she would be a regular character in the show's second series. After filming her first scene, which would have closed the final episode of the first series, the producers changed their minds about including the character, dropped the scene and released Walker from the role. Walker appears on the credits for the episode, despite not appearing. Walker gave her first on screen interview to Time Space Visualiser in May 2020, where she went into much more detail about her release from the role of Sarah Jane Smith. Walker also revealed she later worked with Jon Pertwee on The Navy Lark and told him that although she understood his thinking, she would never forgive him for what he had done. She also admitted that she stopped watching Doctor Who after being released.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M44Y0yd1Xvw Doctor Who producer Letts later cast Walker in his production of The Prince and the Pauper. However, in her 2020 interview, Walker also revealed that any fees she earned from BBC productions were off-set against her payment for series 11 of Doctor Who until the full amount was repaid.

He is often mistaken for Innocent “Mummy” Malama, another goalkeeper who featured for the national team prior to Zambia’s independence. In 1970, Malama moved from Roan to Chibuku Warriors for what was then the record transfer fee in Zambian football.Tembo, Potipher. Record fee for Malama? Times of Zambia, Ndola. 4 April 1970, p.10 Early life Malama was born in Luanshya and went to Makoma Primary School.Tembo, Potipher. \\"Meet Happy ‘cat’ Malama – Zambia’s ex-goalie,\\" Sunday Times of Zambia Sports Special Pull out, Ndola. 6 July 2003, p.3 He played as a goalkeeper in the Luanshya Youth League alongside future Zambian internationals and Roan United teammates Boniface Simutowe, Sandy Kaposa and Willie Chifita.Chapema, Dunstan. \\"Secret of Roan United,\\" Zambia Mail, Lusaka. 28 November 1957, p. 21 At the age of thirteen, he started playing for the school team and continued doing so when he graduated to Luanshya Central School and when he completed his second year of secondary education, he left school to join Roan United’s reserve team in 1962. Playing career In 1963, Malama featured for Roan United’s second reserve team and the following season, he made his debut for Roan aged seventeen on 9 September 1964, in a league match against Mufulira Wanderers at Shinde Stadium which Roan lost 3-1. Malama took over from his namesake Innocent “Mummy” Malama, the former goalkeeper for the Northern Rhodesian African national team and won many admirers with his agility. Despite his tender age, he was a safe pair of hands and won the nickname “Trustee.” His sharp reflexes also earned him the moniker “Cat” among Roan supporters. Although standing at only 5 ft 6’, Malama had excellent reflexes but also had some peculiar habits. A temperamental character, he often berated his defenders and if they did not follow his instructions he would sometimes put his point across by leaving the goal unguarded and allowing the opposition to score. His performances for Roan soon earned him a call-up to the national team but in April 1970, Malama left Roan to sign for Division I side Chibuku Warriors of Kitwe for K2,000, which was the record fee in Zambian football. At Chibuku, he also took on coaching duties as player-coach He did not stay long at Chibuku, moving to Kitwe United in 1972 where he stayed for two seasons before leaving for Lusaka side, Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO)-sponsored Malaiti Rangers in 1974 where he was player-coach. When his mother died the following year, Malama decided to return to Luanshya and rejoin the mines but Roan were not interested in re-signing him because of his reputation of hardly staying with any club for a long time. He was thus discharged from the mines and went back to work for ZESCO but moved on shortly afterwards to join amateur side Tazama Pipelines in Ndola where he ended his playing career. National team Malama made his national team debut on 12 September 1965 against Kenya in the opening game of the three-match of Rothman’s Cup series in Ndola which ended in a 3-3 draw.Lillis, Larry. “A gallant comeback by Zambia” Times of Zambia, Ndola. 13 September 1965, p.12 He played in the second game as well, a 2-3 defeat but did not feature in the final game which Zambia won by the same score line. He returned to man the posts for Zambia in 1967 when they lifted the Jamhuri Cup and the Heroes Cup against Kenya and Uganda respectively. He was in goal when Zambia played their first ever World Cup qualifier against Sudan which they won 4-2 in Ndola and featured in the second leg which Zambia lost by the same score but were eliminated by virtue of losing the second leg.“It’s one up for Zambia” Times of Zambia, Ndola. 28 October 1968, p.12“Zambia go down 4–2” Times of Zambia, Ndola. 9 November 1968, p.8 In October 1969, Malama quit the national team after a game against Daring Falcons Club of Zaire in which he fractured his wrist and no Football Association of Zambia official went to see him afterwards. He however made a comeback the following year and helped Zambia eliminate Tanzania from the CAN race 6-2 on aggregate. His last game for Zambia was a 4-3 defeat to Malawi on 18 March 1971 in a friendly match in Zomba. In all, he made 21 appearances for Zambia.

They investigate arson, homicides, sexual assaults, fraud, cyber, identity theft, and other crimes. Their forensic services include DNA, biology, firearm, latent print, toxicology and drug chemistry analysis. Other units in the CBI include Crime Scene Services, Crime Information Management Unit, Criminal Justice Information Systems, and Colorado’s InstaCheck Unit. The CBI is designated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division, as the CJIS Systems Agency for Colorado. It is headquartered in the Denver suburb of Lakewood at 690 Kipling Street. They work in concert with other organizations, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, county sheriff's offices, district attorney's offices, state police, and other law enforcement agencies. As of 1999, the investigation into the death of JonBenét Ramsey was the largest single case load, with more than 3,000 work hours for 2,509 laboratory specimen analysis and 25,520 lab examinations. In the summer of 1998, the Cortez police officer shooting resulted in 2,830 investigative hours by CBI agents. (Hunting Badger was inspired by the shooting death of Dale Claxton). The Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which performs background checks for firearm purchases, was involved in the case of Trader James Gowda, a firearms dealer for more than 20 years. It was described as the largest gun-trafficking case in history (as of 2000) by a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Denver office employee. Gowda sold thousands of firearms at gunshows, mostly without background check paperwork. Under federal law, every firearm dealer's customer is required to have a background check. Gowda only performed background checks with the CBI on 15 customers between 1994 and 1996 and, after he was indicted by a federal grand jury, no more than 10 gun customers between January 1999 and June 2000. The CBI conducts all Colorado background checks of gun buyers except for one four-month period in 1999. In 2004, the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners lobbied for a bill that would have erased the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's database of concealed-weapons permit holders. Prior to 2007 permit holders were classified as \\"persons of interest\\" by the CBI. In 2007 the CBI moved permit holders out of that classification. Despite previous extensions of the law that allowed for the statewide database, the General Assembly did not renew the database and instead let it sunset. CBI's Arvarda lab was updated in 2016 with a \\"state-of-the-art forensic science laboratory\\" to improve their laboratory capability and efficiency in rape kit and toxicology testing. The $7 million renovation was funded by House Bill 1020 to ensure that the state met standards for rape kit testing. The Arvada laboratory, the largest of CBI's facilities, analyzes evidence from more than 10,000 cases and process more than 40,000 items of evidence each year.

He was born in 1746. His parents were Jonathan Chubb (1715-1805), a Bridgwater timber and wine merchant, and his wife Mary Morley, (1715-1787). John did not become a professional artist, but kept his work private. He helped run the family business, and took an active part in town politics in the Whig cause, and was Mayor of Bridgwater in 1788. He was active in the local campaign to abolish the Slave Trade. Biography of the Chubb family Jonathan Chubb (1715-1805) was the son of James Chubb (born 1691?) and his wife Elinor Venicot. He was related to the family of Thomas Chubb The Deist,Somerset Record Office, A\\\\CSC/2/2 : Letter in the Chubb papers notes him as 'Dear Cousin' and through his mother to the mother of the actress and author Mary Robinson (poet).Maria Elizabeth Robinson, Memoirs of the late Mrs Robinson, written by herself, 4 vols, London, 1801 I, p 6.

They had three children, John, Kitty, (b 1748), who married the Rev David Webber, and Sarah, (b 1751), who married Captain Thomas Morris. Family tree in the Blake Museum library. John Chubb was born in Bridgwater 9 May 1746. A precocious child,Letter from Jonathan Chubb, dated December 1750, noted he could read and write and knew a number of Latin and Greek words. John displayed a talent for art but did not take it up professionally. By 1778 he was a burgess and so a councillor, and was elected Mayor of Bridgwater in 1788. He was a Radical and supported the Whig cause, and was active in promoting Bridgwater's anti-slavery petition to Parliament in 1785. He was one of the promoters of Bridgwater Infirmary, and served as treasurer to the time of his death in 1818. He married Mary Wetherell (1765-1812), from Wells, and they had three children, Morley (1788-1855), Lucy (1794-1867) and Charles James (1797-1872). John Chubb died 2 February 1818, after an illness lasting two years. Morley Chubb succeeded to the family business. He married Frances Alford, (1788-1850) and they had 14 children, all bar the youngest born in Bridgwater, — nine boys and five girls. Morley Chubb, Charles James Chubb and John Bowen entered into a partnership to own a wine merchants' business under the name of M. Chubb & Co in Bridgwater. This was dissolved in June 1830 in favour of John Bowen London Gazette, 1830, pt2 p 1370 By 1832 the family had moved to London, and were living in Burton Street, Islington.Electoral register for the Hundred of North Petherton, 1832 The 1841 census records him as a 'Professor of Music', and the 1851 the secretary of a commercial company—The Crosse Patent Co.

He died at the house of his brother, John, in 1852 aged 29 Of the other sons, Hammond Chubb (1829-1904) was for 30 years secretary to the Bank of England, (which he had joined in 1847) and died in 1904 aged 75.The Times (London, England), Saturday, Oct 01, 1904; pg. 13; Issue 37514. Lucy Chubb was unmarried and she ran a school, in Castle Street, Bridgwater in 1830, and later moved to London to join her brother, where she died in 1867. Charles James Chubb, named for John Chubb's friend Charles James Fox, was also unmarried, and by 1841 had moved to The Midlands where he was appointed chief cashier and book keeper of Boulton and Watt's Soho Manufactory at Smethwick. On his retirement 1863 he also moved to London, where he died in 1872. The paintings and drawings Nearly 400 sketches and finished drawings and a number of documents survived John Chubb's death and remained with the family. There are portraits of John Chubb's immediate family, portraits of Bridgwater worthies, unidentified portraits and topographical paintings. A number of the latter are by John Chubb's descendants. The manuscripts are mainly family letters, some from the 17th century, letters to John Chubb and a few relating to his descendants in the nineteenth century. The Blake Museum had long possessed a number of John Chubb's topographical paintings of the town, and from 1977, sixty of the portraits of local worthies had been on loan from the family to the museum. The family offered the entire collection to the Museum, and in 2004 Blake Museum reached its appeal target of £123,000. John Chubb's topographical work shows Bridgwater streets and buildings, and his portraits are of his family and local worthies. A number of the paintings feature pretty girls in ornate hats. His portraits of tradesmen and craftsmen include their tools, rather like the Books of Trades of earlier centuries. There are more portraits than topographical paintings. Some time in the early C19 lithographic prints were made of about a dozen of his paintings of Bridgwater scenes, and these are fully represented in the Museum's collection. They were probably by his grandson, John Chubb the younger, also a talented artist. A letter (in the Chubb MS in the Somerset Record Office) which he wrote to his father, Morley, in 1835, mentions him having drawings reproduced as prints by Charles Joseph Hullmandel, the foremost lithographic printer of the time. The collection includes letters from Charles James Fox,T. Bruce Dilks, Charles James Fox and the Borough of Bridgwater (Bridgwater: East Gate Press, 1937) and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. There are also papers concerning the family business. The manuscripts have been deposited at the Somerset Heritage Centre Archive, Taunton.A\\\\CSC Papers of John Chubb and family of Bridgwater The Museum has a permanent gallery about John Chubb, his life and his work.

It protects a relatively small fragment of Atlantic Forest. Location The Lorena National Forest is in the municipality of Lorena, São Paulo. It has an area of . The forest has the largest and most diverse area of Atlantic Forest in the great plain known as the Paraíba Valley. It is an important source of seeds to maintain genetic diversity of tree species. The forest is surrounded in part by the town of Lorena, and by areas of cattle pasturage and rice fields. The forest is used by school students and by residents of the town as a traditional recreation area. There are about 2,000 visitors annually. History The Estação Florestal Experimental Dr. Epitácio Santiago (Dr. Epitácio Santiago Experimental Forest Station) was created by decree 24.104 of 10 April 1934. Law 6.209 of 28 May 1975 changed the category of the conservation unit. Ordnance 246 of 18 July 2001 renamed the conservation unit to the Lorena National Forest, with an area of in the municipality of Lorena. The purpose is to promote the proper management of natural resources to ensure protection of water resources, scenic beauty and historical and archaeological sites, to encourage development of basic and applied scientific research, and to support environmental education, recreational activities, leisure and tourism. The forest is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) created the consultative council on 30 August 2005. The forest became part of the Mantiqueira Mosaic of conservation units, created in 2006. On 5 August 2008 IBAMA and the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) launched an inquiry into irregularities in extraction of wood, sand mining, disappearance of wild animals and sale of seedlings. The forest is now administered by ICMBio. The management plan was approved on 10 May 2016.

It is based on, but smaller than and substantially different from, a Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel UAV that was captured and reverse-engineered by Iran. It is one of two Iranian flying wing UAVs based on the RQ-170, along with the Shahed 171 Simorgh. The Saegheh was revealed in October 2016. A number of sources have expressed doubt that the Seagheh is weapons-capable, and say it is solely an ISR platform. As of 2017, 10 Saegheh drones were in production, and Iran planned to procure at least 50 by 2025.  Variants  The specifications for the Saegheh are unknown, but it is believed to have a wingspan around 6-7m. =Saegheh-1= The Saegheh-1 was first presented at an Iranian arms expo in 2016. Iranian state news claimed the Saegheh-1 could carry four Sadid-1 precision-guided anti-tank guided missiles. The Iranian Government did not provide a demonstration of the UAV flying, or state what its range was. The Saegheh-1 had no apparent targeting/optical system. The first models of Saegheh lacked the frontal air intake of the Simorgh/RQ-170. =Saegheh-2= This model is also known as the Shahed 191. Later shown models have frontal air intake. The probability is that only piston engined models don't have frontal intakes. The UAV takes off from specialized racks mounted on a vehicle speeding down a runway (probably Toyota Hilux trucks) and is recovered on a runway with retractable landing skids. The Shahed 191 carries two Sadid-1 missiles internally and lands on retractable landing skids. The Shahed 191 has a cruising speed of 300 km/h, an endurance of 4.5 hours, a range of 450 km, and a payload of 50kg. The ceiling is 25,000 ft. Fars News Agency says the Saegheh-2 has been used in combat in Syria. =Propeller-powered variant= In wargames held in 2019 Iran showed a Saegheh variant powered by a propeller. It carries its Sadid-1 weapons externally and lands on fixed landing skids. It takes off similarly to the Shahed 191 variant.  Operational history  Benjamin Netanyahu presents part of a destroyed Saegheh drone at the Munich Security Conference 2018 On 1 October 2018, the IRGC Aerospace Force used ballistic missiles and drones, supposedly including Saegheh UAVs, to attack targets in the Abu Kamal region, in Eastern Syria.Iran uses drones and missiles in cross border attack on enemies in Syria, armyrecognition.com/, October 4, 2018. Although Iran had first shown the Saegheh with four Sadid-1 missiles slung under the body, in this incident they released video they said showed a Saegheh UAV releasing a single Sadid-1 bomb from its internal bomb bays. Twitter posts were critical of the video. Israel shot down a Saegheh during the February 2018 Israel–Syria incident. The Times of Israel reported that the UAV's design was largely based on the captured RQ-170; IAF Brigadier General Tomer Bar said that the drone was quite advanced and imitated western technology.

The Austrian Bishops' Conference was established in 1849 and agreed to a Concordat which would grant them greater scope in a variety of areas. They were granted full control over their own affairs, including making appointments. The Catholic church was also placed in charge of 98% of public primary schools, i.e. those nominally Catholic and controlled the curriculum. The Catholic ecclesiastical courts were given jurisdiction over marriages where either or both the couple were Catholic. International repercussions and abolishment The Concordat had an impact across Germany stimulating anti-clericism amongst liberal opinion. During the Austro-Prussian War the Austrian soldiers were called \\"Concordat soldiers\\". The Austrian defeat in this war forced the Emperor Franz Josef to grant concessions to German liberals in Cisleithania. Following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the liberals, in the Josephinist tradition, largely influenced the Cisleithanian constitution of 1867. Article 17 of the constitution designated that \\"The state shall have the right to superior direction and superintendence over the entire system of education and instruction.\\" The abolishment of the Concordat was formalised in 1870.

Today the line's trackbed, which is in length, and includes a tunnel and several bridges, is a rail trail, which serves as a panoramic footpath in summer, and as a route for cross-country skiing in winter . Even before the Vitznau–Rigi rack railway was opened in 1871, the Rigi Massif was a major tourist attraction, with a number of grand hotels occupying various locations on the massif. One of these was at the summit of the Scheidegg peak, which was not served by either the Vitznau–Rigi line or the Arth–Rigi rack railway that followed it. In order to provide easier access for its guests, the Rigi–Scheidegg railway was built to provide a link to Rigi Kaltbad on the Vitznau–Rigi line. The line opened in two stages, with the stage from Kaltbad to First opening on the 14 July 1874, and the section from First to Scheiddegg on the 1 June 1875. Unlike the Vitznau–Rigi line, the Rigi–Scheidegg railway followed the contours near the top of the mountain, rather than climbing it, and was not a rack railway. It was built to , and so never made a direct connection to the standard gauge Vitznau–Rigi line. Instead, the two lines met at right angles, and provision was made for the transfer of passengers and goods. Although three steam locomotives were built by Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) for the opening of the line, two were found sufficient to operate it, so the third sold to an unknown purchaser in 1884. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the tourist industry collapsed and never recovered in the same form. When tourists did return to the mountains, they came as day trippers, meaning that the mountain-top hotels were no longer needed. That hit the Rigi–Scheidegg railway particularly hard, and the line closed on the 21 September 1931, never to reopen.

It first aired on 3 September 2016. Plot Kirk and Spock are traveling to the Starbase at Corinth IV for a classified briefing, while Sulu and McKennah take some leisure time, Sulu to visit a museum, McKennah to chase up the social changes in Orion society following the Enterprise's incident with Zaminhon and the slave girl Lolani. At the starbase, Kirk and Spock are greeted by Commodore Laura Gray, who informs them that the crew of the Hood has been lost due to life support systems failure. The Enterprise has been sent to tow the Hood home and due to several losses across the quadrant, when the Hood starts out again, it will need experienced officers assigned to it. She formally offers Spock a promotion to Captain. Meanwhile, with Scott in command, the Enterprise is investigating what happened to the Hood, science officer Follet suggests it may be connected to the subspace anomaly they were investigating. Back at Corinth IV, Gray informs Kirk and Spock of a complication. Commander Diana Garrett, 1st officer of Earth's Space Dock, had applied for the Captaincy of the Hood but was turned down, she has now launched a formal appeal, stating she has been overlooked because she's a woman. Kirk and Spock are shocked at such an assertion in the 23rd century. Gray states that Tellarite diplomacy may be a factor, as 100 years ago the Federation was formed due to an alliance of Humans, Vulcans, Andorians and Tellarites united against the Romulan incursion, Tellar Prime's resources played an important factor in the Federation's victory. Tellarite society frowns on females being starship captains especially constitution class starships, which are top of the line, despite Starfleet have plenty of female captains in its history. However, although Starfleet and the Federation are not bound by Tellarite views, since the controversial admission of Coridan to the Federation, the Tellarites have indicated they may leave the Federation, robbing it of a vital resource and ally. Gray asks Kirk to interview Garrett and decide if she is a suitable candidate. Both Kirk and Spock are troubled by the notion that Starfleet may be engaging in undue bias against women, but also are both conflicted by the fact that Spock would have to leave the Enterprise. On the Enterprise, all other systems on the Hood appear to be normal, nor is there any sign of the anomaly they were investigating. Scotty decides to learn more about what happened before they tow the ship home. Spock confers with Dr. McKennah, regarding Garrett and what she is claiming. McKennah believes the Tellarite threats are not to be taken seriously, but there might be another issue at work. She states that how people evaluate others is a many-layered process and that if bias does exist, it is often subconscious. Spock, who knows what it's like to be treated differently agrees, however, he notes that there are incidents in Garrett's service record that warrant scrutiny, and this may be why she is being overlooked rather than her sex. McKennah asks Spock if Garrett would be under the same amount of scrutiny if she was male and Spock believes so although he cannot be sure if everyone else would concur. Garrett arrives at Corinth IV with Vice Admiral Stomm, Kirk interviews her briefly and is impressed with her record, however when he questions her about an incident she was involved in at Nimbus III where her captain was killed, Garrett refuses to discuss the incident and becomes defensive, she then calls a halt to the interview and leaves, leaving Kirk dumbfounded. Later on, Gray informs Kirk that Garrett has now demanded a formal hearing to determine the Captaincy of the Hood, the board will be presided by Gray, Stomm, and Kirk. On the Enterprise, Ensign Chekov attempts to provide power to the Hood's engine room, long enough for several hours of life support to better determine what happened. However, he is disappointed when Uhura and Follet are selected to go on the away team and he is not. Uhura has noticed he feels overlooked and points out that while he has many skills, he is not focused and should prioritize which department will best suit his talent. Back on Corinth IV, the hearing begins with Gray presiding. The Vulcan admiral Stomm questions Spock regarding his youth and whether his emotions and his Human heritage played a part in his career choices, referring to when he turned down admission to the Vulcan Science Academy. Kirk objects as Spock racial heritage should not have a bearing on his career outcome, Stomm counters by saying that the skills and abilities of all individuals are products of their race, religion, and even sex. Kirk, to quash any doubts of his favoring of Spock states that while it is definitely time for a woman to command a frontline Constitution class starship, but is not sure if Garrett is the right woman to do so. When Garrett takes the stand, it is noted that she has a lot more qualifications and been decorated more times by Starfleet than Spock, on paper she would make an ideal captain, however, Gray brings up the Nimbus III incident, which concerns her. The official investigation into the incident suggested human error, Garrett disputes that by saying the report was conducted by a Tellarite, who may have had a bias against her and she protested the findings and it was determined that she was cleared of any wrongdoing. Gray also notes that Garrett and her other officers plead the seventh guarantee during the inquiry, where they refused to answer the questions presented to them to avoid self-recrimination. Once again Garrett denies any wrongdoing as by law, pleading the seventh cannot be used to imply guilt. Gray states that she is concerned that there are other similar incidents in Garrett's record and it seems that Garrett reacts with hostility whenever her judgment is questioned as part of being a Captain is being able to admit when one was wrong and take responsibility. Garrett states that she reacts with hostility because of the undue scrutiny she believes she receives as a woman and is once again adamant that she was not in the wrong. In the Hood's engine room, Uhura, Scott, Follet, and Drake can find no evidence on an anomaly that could have caused the system failure which killed the crew. Suddenly out of nowhere, the Hood's engines activate and begin to overload, and their shield comes online, meaning the Enterprise cannot beam them out. The ship will explode in minutes. Scott orders Lt. Hadley to clear away before the Hood explodes, but Chekov believes he can transmit a duotronic algorithm to the Hood, which would deactivate its shields, Scott protests claiming it's too dangerous. Hadley allows Chekov to proceed, the circuits overload, and Chekov collapses, but it works and the Enterprise is able to beam the away team home just before the Hood explodes. On Corinth, Stomm endorses Garrett for Captaincy, Gray endorses Spock, however before Kirk can vote, Gray is informed that the Hood has been destroyed, rendering the proceeding useless. Before it ends, Garrett declares that even though the Hood has been destroyed, the issue still remains that female officers are being overlooked for Captaincy and while it may not be intentional it still exists and it is time something was done about it. Starfleet has the opportunity to implement change, although Garrett maybe not be a Captain this time, there are still plenty of women who could be. Everyone agrees. On the Enterprise, Chekov is recovering and Scott is admonishing him for his foolish actions, Chekov agrees but is confused when Scott refers to him as Lieutenant. Scott has informed an admiral of his bravery and original thinking which has earned him a promotion. Despite the happiness, Scott is still worried about the mystery surrounding the Hood. Uhura thanks Chekov for saving them. Kirk meanwhile is speaking with the Tellarite ambassador, who states that he is aware the biased view his people have of women is not in keeping with Federation values or modern standards and that he is part of a movement trying to make changes and tells Kirk when the time comes for a female captain, Starfleet will have his support. Kirk appreciates the Tellar Prime is embracing the winds of change. In the final scene, Kirk and Spock meet with Garrett one last time. Garrett and Kirk part ways having developed a mutual respect for each other, Garrett hopes that one day a Garrett will command an Enterprise, and Kirk states that anything is possible. When Garrett leaves, both Spock and Kirk agree that despite sadness for the loss of the Hood, both are also somewhat glad as it means they will not have to separate. And with that, they head back to the Enterprise. Trivia Garrett hopes that someday a Garrett will command an Enterprise, nearly 80 years later Rachel Garrett is in command of the Enterprise C, as seen in The Next Generation episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\". This episode connects to the rebooted Star Trek movies, where despite the change in reality, Spock still turns down a place at the Vulcan Science Academy, being the first person to do so and it is subtly implied he did it out of spite after the admissions council were disrespectful to Spock's Human mother. The episode also addresses some inconsistencies regarding female Captains in the series. In the Original Series, it is implied in \\"Turnabout Intruder\\" by Janice Lester that women cannot be Starship captains, which obviously would be discriminatory and not keeping with the Federation's values of equality. However, the line could have also been interpreted in other ways; for example, Lester was mentally unstable and possibly was not able to be a Captain because of these issues. Lester was also bitter about her failed relationship with Kirk and may have also been stating as a Captain, Kirk wouldn't let her, a woman, get close. Later in the episode Kirk, while trapped in Lester's body, stated that Lester craved power but her own issues prevented her career from progressing and why their relationship failed. Gene Roddenberry at the time stated the line was purely sexist, but Kirk correctly states that from Starfleet's inception there have been female captains, most probably referring to Erika Hernandez, who was in command of the second NX class starship. Also of note: in the opening scene of the episode, Sulu mentions that his great(x6) grandfather grew up in an internment camp during WWII. This is no doubt an homage to George Takei, the first actor to portray Sulu during the Original Series run. Takei, in fact, grew up in an internment camp during WWII. This episode serves as the start of a story arc regarding the mystery of what happened aboard the USS Hood, which is resolved in the series finale.

Sterling (July 29, 1920 – January 12, 1995) was a medical doctor and prominent researcher on the topic of thyroid hormone and human metabolism. He made significant discoveries on thyroid hormone activation and treated patients at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center for over thirty years.  Early life and friendship with H. P. Lovecraft Sterling was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1920. At the age of 14, Sterling became acquainted with H.P. Lovecraft when his family moved to Providence and he began attending Classical High School. He saw Lovecraft frequently during this time (1935–36), then corresponded with him when he went to Harvard in the fall of 1936. he collaborated with Lovecraft on \\"In the Walls of Eryx\\" (January 1936). Aside from the early memoir, \\"Lovecraft and Science\\" (in Marginalia), 1944, Sterling wrote the poignant reminiscent article \\"Caverns Measureless to Man\\" (Science- Fantasy Correspondent, 1975) about Lovecraft. This article quoted extensively from his letters to Lovecraft, which have not otherwise been widely available. It is hoped that his heirs will deposit these letters in an institution in the course of time.The New Lovecraft Collector 10 (Spring 1995), p. 1 Lovecraft's letters to Sterling as based on transcripts held by Arkham House have been published in the volume H. P:. Lovecraft, Letters to Robert Bloch and Others, ed. David E. Schultz and S. T. Joshi. NY: Hippocampus Press, 2015. When he was sixteen, he enrolled in the undergraduate program at Harvard University, from which he graduated in 1940. As an undergraduate student, he published his first scientific paper at the age of 19. He then went to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he earned his medical degree in 1943 at the age of 23.  Career  In 1958, Sterling joined Columbia University as a research associate at the College of Physicians & Surgeons. In 1962 he was appointed assistant clinical professor of medicine and became staff physician in nuclear medicine and director of the protein research laboratory at the Department of Veterans' Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx, New York City. In 1970, Sterling became associate clinical professor of medicine, later rising to full clinical professor in 1974.  Research impact  Rosalyn Yalow, Ph.D. (left) and Bronx VA Medical Center Director, Harold Jaffrey (right) Sterling was one of the first researchers to use radioactive iodine to treat thyroid diseases. He used radioisotopic labels to study the metabolism of human serum proteins and red blood cells. He discovered that the body converts the pro-hormone thyroxine into triiodothyronine, the primary active form of thyroid hormone.\\"Lewis E. Braverman.\\" Interview by Michael Chappelle. Oral and Video History Interviews. The Endocrine Society, 22 June 2014. Web. 2 October 2016. This breakthrough led to a new field of thyroid hormone research and led to the first early studies on the mechanism of action of thyroid hormones. Sterling developed the equilibrium dialysis method for measuring free thyroxine, which remains the gold standard for evaluating free hormone levels in blood today. Sterling was a pioneering investigator identifying mitochondrial thyroid hormone receptors, shortened isoforms of the full-length, nuclear receptors. He wrote a chapter on thyroid hormone receptors in the fifth edition of Werner's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Text, which is known as \\"the bible of modern thyroidology.\\" In 1972, Sterling was awarded the William S. Middleton Award for Excellence in Research, the highest honor of the VA Medical Center. He was cited for developing the 51Cr labeling of red blood cells for clinical applications.  Death  Sterling continued treating patients at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center up until a few days before he died. He died on January 12, 1995 while at his home in Riverdale, New York, at the age of 74. The probable cause of death was complications of an aneurysm. The International Workshop on Resistance to Thyroid Hormone, a biannual research forum, dedicated its third meeting to Sterling in 1997.

Its founder, Jacob Holmblad, also had its home in the complex. The building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish national registry of protected buildings in 1918. History Jacob Holmblad Jacob Holmblad was born in 1736 in Sweden, the son of Lars Holm (1697–1767) who was farrier at Tjolöholm Castle. He completed an apprenticeship as dyer and emigrated to Denmark in about 1766. He was soon employed at the Royal Textile Manufactury in Rigensgade where he introduced new production methods at the Garrison Hospital. He used Rubia plants to produce the red dye for the Royal Life Guards' gala uniforms. In 1775 he obtained a royal license to set up his own dye factory. It was built in Sølvgade in Sølvgade, around the corner from where he had until then worked. The Holmblad House in 1898 The company later moved to the corner of Gothersgade and Regnegade. The enterprise was later taken over by his son, Lauridz Holmblad, who also founded a soap factory in 1805 and started Denmark's first real production of paint in 1819. L. P. Holmblad's father Jacob Holmblad inherited the soap factory in 1827 while his uncle Carl Frederik Holmblad took over the paint factory, the later Sadolin & Holmblad. Later residents in the house in Sølvgade include Christian Thorning Engelstoft who lived there in the 1830s. He later became Bishop of the Diocese of Funen as well as Minister of Education in 1860. The composer Niels W. Gade lived in the house in 1856–57. Architecture The Holmblad House is designed in the Baroque style. Just two storeys tall and 10 bays long, it is the lowest building in the street. It consists of two symmetrically arranged halves under a single Mansard roof with red tiles. Each half features a central projection crowned by a triangular pediment with relief decorations. The western half may already have been completed in 1763 while the eastern one is from 1867. A large gateway to the left of the building opens to the yard. The main building has a side wing that projects from its rear side, connecting to a three-storey warehouse. The buildings in the courtyard have yellow finishing, unlike the facade on the street which is finished in a light greyish colour. Today The complex was purchased by Artha Ejendomme A/S in 2015 and put through a renovation. It contains 13 apartments and seven commercial tenancies.

The 96-minute comedy premiered at the Harkins Valley Art Center on May 4, 2012. This film stars Tatanka Means, Greg Fernanadez and Mary Kim Titla. Wanting to celebrate and showcase Native cultural tradition, Hamilton says “More Than Frybread is a comedy to showcase nationalism and inter-tribal competition”  Plot  This 90 minute mockumentary shadows fry-bread making obsessed tribes, Navajo, Tohono O’odham, Yavapai- Apache, Hopi, and the Hualapai and the wacky events that follows them all throughout the national competition as they each represent one of the 22 Arizona tribes to compete at the annual State of Arizona Frybread competition. This story starts with Buddy Begay and his food truck where he sold fry bread on his family's reservation in Arizona. Enjoying the attention from the crowds and the fans, Buddy gloats his way to the World Wide Frybread Association competition and is determined to do whatever it takes to win. In the finals, Buddy is joined by “Sunshine Smith (Dey Gomez), Stormy (Gomez’s real life twin Tawnya), Sharmayne Cruz (Teresa M. Choyguha) and Sammy Powsky (Camille Nighthorse). While displaying the cultural pride in the dish, Hamilton goes on to show the characters and their journey towards the competition.  Cast  * Tatanka Means - Buddy Begay / Frybread Roadman * Greg Ferenandez: Joel Thomas. Reporter * Mary Kim Titla: Tracey Lightning * Teresa M. Choyghua: Sharmayne Cruz * Camille Nighorse: Sammy Powskey * Dey Gomez: Sunshine Smith  Background  The title and concept of this film was heavily influenced by the post-colonial native dish frybread which has a daunting and sad history. In 1864-1968 Navajo Native Americans were forcibly evicted and endured a three-hundred mile journey from Arizona to New Mexico which was formally known as “The Long Walk”. Living on flour, sugar, salt and lard given by the government, was transformed into “Fry Bread”. This dish has been seen as a symbol of pride and has been passed down from generations. When asked “ Why Frybread?” Hamilton responded “I wanted to make a movie that gave us an excuse to shoot on numerous reservations and make new friends. I thought frybread was a good thing that had the potential to bring people together. I liked the idea of a mockumentary frybread contest and wondered why there wasn't a real national frybread contest. I didn’t realize how big frybread really was.\\" Hamilton's main goal is to change the way people view Native Americans. Due to the fact that there is a very limited amount of comedies and dramas regarding Natives in the mainstream media. He wanted to use frybread as something that could bring people and other culture together. This film's success and great feedback inspired Hamilton to create a spin off of the show as a comedy called \\"Frybread\\". The show was put on hold until funding could be found to support the project. Wanting to continue to display Native Americans through various characters and narratives, Hamilton has made four contemporary films; the others are “Pete and Cleo (2010), “Blue Gap Boyz” (2008) and Turquoise Rose (2007).

He was indicted with Waldemar Drwall, who was an associate of Gowda. It was described as the \\"largest gun-trafficking case\\" (as of 2000) that the agency knew of by Chris Eastburn, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Denver office inspector. It is estimated that criminals used hundreds of guns purchased from Gowda in the commission of their crimes, according to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Gowda was reported to have only had a \\"handful\\" of federal sales forms for the sale of firearms at gun shows. He claimed that he was selling guns from his personal collection. Gowda sold thousands of firearms at gun shows in various states, including the state of Colorado, mostly without background check paperwork. He also sold guns from his suburban Denver home, which he licensed as a gun business. Under federal law, every firearm dealer's customer is required to have a background check. Gowda performed background checks with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on only 15 customers between 1994 and 1996 and, after he was indicted by a federal grand jury, no more than 10 gun customers between January 1999 and June 2000. The CBI conducted all Colorado background checks of gun buyers except for one four-month period in 1999. Gowda pleaded guilty and in a plea agreement agreed \\"to cooperate fully with the government's investigation\\" into his gun sales and forfeit 225 guns seized from his house in 1996. The government agreed to recommended a 10 to 16-month prison term at a January sentencing date. In addition, the recommendation was to include a provision that half of the time could be served in detention in his house. Gowda filed a suit with the Colorado District Court in Jefferson County requesting that his sentence be vacated and/or an illegal sentence corrected, which was denied by presiding Federal District Judge Wiley Y. Daniel. Background Gowda began selling guns in 1978. He and Waldemar Drwall were soon indicted on charges of selling handguns to people who did not live in Colorado and dealing guns without a license. He pleaded guilty to one charge of selling a handgun to someone from Wyoming. His indictment was dropped when he entered a pretrial diversion program. He licensed his Arvada house as a business location between 1981 and 1999, which was precluded by an Arvada ordinance against residential retail sales, and with his wife sold firearms in gun shows in the western United States. A review by ATF inspector Melanie Shea in February 1990 resulted in a warning. His house was raided in 1996 and 227 guns were found in his basement, 223 of the guns were seized by federal prosecutors. Forms were found that showed that thousands of guns had been purchased but there were only a \\"handful\\" of federal firearm sales forms. There were also sales records that showed only minimal income from gun sales. Gowda continued to sell arms at gun shows after his November 1999 indictment. Informants and undercover agents found that he continued to sell guns without sales forms and background checks at Tulsa, Phoenix, Las Vegas and several Colorado gun shows. He signed the name \\"Jim Phillips\\" on one handwritten receipt. Joe St. Veltri, Gowda's attorney claimed that since the media attention of the Columbine High School massacre, there had been a change in the law enforcement community regarding firearms sales. Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \\"now focuses some of its law enforcement efforts in an area that they had ignored. [...] I think gun shows, in the last two years, have become the most important concern of ATF,\\" according to Veltri. The bureau's Denver enforcement chief, Gerald Petrilli, agreed. He said that better investigative techniques and enforcement strategy and improved manpower have resulted in more federal court cases.

She describes grief as a catalyst for redefining identity, and outlines the process of \\"reentry\\", or returning to life. Background Christina Rasmussen studied grief at the University of Durham in England, and her Master's thesis is on the subject of bereavement. On July 21, 2006, Christina's husband of 10 years, Bjarne Rasmussen, died from Stage IV colon cancer. Christina continued working to support her children. After switching careers, Rasmussen decided in 2010 to focus on her work as an independent grief counselor. Continuing her prior research in the field, she began identifying a pattern of behaviors and beliefs that serve to perpetuate grief and affect quality of life after loss. Aligning her observations with concepts from neuroscience and, more specifically, neuroplasticity, Rasmussen developed a new model of grief. Overview Rasmussen's model of grief is known as the Life Reentry Model, referring to the notion that grief is not only a function of coping with loss, but also of each individual's need to \\"reenter\\" life. The model echoes concepts previously described by George Bonanno, a clinical psychology professor at Columbia University (Teachers College), and a pioneering researcher in bereavement.http://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/index.htm?facid=gab38 George A. Bonanno's Columbia University Faculty Page For example, the model calls for the grieving individual to use action to recover, parallel to Bonanno's theory of psychological resilience.Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, Professor of Psychology, Yale University, “Bonanno has revolutionized our thinking about how people respond to loss and trauma. The Other Side of Sadness has tremendous implications for interventions and for how people see themselves.”Daniel Gilbert, Professor of Psychology, Harvard University; author of Stumbling on Happiness, “There are a lot of books on bereavement and now you can throw them all away. Bonanno carefully assembles scientific evidence to show that most of what we thought we knew is just plain wrong.” As well, the model opposes traditionally pervasive theories in the field, such as the stages of grief defined in the Kübler-Ross model, and Freud's description of \\"grief work\\". Reception Edward J. Benz Jr., president and CEO of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, remarked that \\"Second Firsts shows us why we must start living again and how to go about it. This engaging, touching, and helpful work is a must read for anyone facing or coping with the loss of someone close.” Anita Moorjani, New York Times best-selling author and survivor of a Near Death Experience (NDE), wrote that \\"In Second Firsts you will discover how to move from merely surviving to once again thriving.\\" Karen Salmansohn, a best- selling self-help author, said that \\"Second Firsts is about creating a bigger life after loss. It is about dreaming of a brand new way to fall in love again with living fully. It is certainly not an easy task, but this little book makes it easier.\\" Bernie S. Siegel, American writer, former pediatric surgeon, and New Age speaker, said that \\"Second Firsts can be your life coach, direct you to heal, and create a new life.\\" In 2012, Second Firsts was featured on Hello Giggles, as well as the blog of The White House.

Asturias de Santillana is a historical comarca whose territory in large part corresponded to the central and western part of today's autonomous community of Cantabria, as well as the extreme east of Asturias. Most of the province of Asturias belonged to the comarca of Asturias de Oviedo. Also known also as a merindad and documented since the 13th century, Asturias de Santillana comprised the western part of Cantabria (except Liébana which belongs to another comarca) including the Saja River valley and the Nansa River. Its borders used to go along the coast from the council of Ribadedeva to the municipality of El Astillero (old Camargo Valley), to the shores of the Bay of Santander), which leads to the administrative division of Trasmiera. From the south it went up to the Cantabrian cordillera. All of the valleys of this comarca are perpendicular to the coast. The merinos were representatives of the king and they lived in this administrative division of Santillana del Mar (Cantabria), which is the capital of that territory since 1209. For their living quarters they built a Gothic tower which was secluded from the original urban center, thus creating a new town center, of civil character, around the Torre del Merino (Marine Tower). In 1581, soon after the Nine Valleys Lawsuit, the governor stopped being a marine major and became known as a \\"corrigador,\\" a local administrative and judicial official. Along the marine coast one finds the localities of Santillana del Mar, Comillas and San Vicente de la Barquera. To the west one finds the Saja and Nansa valleys. During the Early Middle Ages and the Ancien Régime, Asturias de Santillana was dominated by the large nobility lines: that of the houses of Mendoza-de la Vega, Dukes of the Infantado, the Marquises of Santillana, and those of Manrique de Lara, the and the .

In 2003, Rasmussen's husband of 10 years, Bjarne Rasmussen, was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer. On July 21, 2006, he died in the intensive care unit of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute at the age of thirty-five. While grieving, Rasmussen continued working to support her two children. She obtained a graduate certificate in human resource management from Northeastern University, and joined the human resource department at PAREXEL, a multinational life sciences consulting firm. Second Firsts In April 2010, Rasmussen created the Life Reentry Model, a model of grieving based on her professional, academic, and personal observations of the bereavement process. This model is the foundation of her 2013 book, Second Firsts, as well as her grief counseling organization of the same name. Rasmussen's model of grief operates on the assumption of psychological resilience, echoing the theories introduced by George Bonanno, a professor of clinical psychology at the Teachers College of Columbia University. Her theories conflict with popularized concepts of grief stemming from the 1917 and 1969 publications of Mourning and Melancholia and On Death and Dying by Sigmund Freud and Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, respectively. The defining characteristic of the model proposed by Second Firsts is the view of loss as a catalyst for change and self-growth.

It is sung in F major with an irregular meter.  History  \\"Give Thanks With a Grateful Heart\\" was written in 1978 by Henry Smith. The song was his only published worship song out of 300 unpublished compositions. It was written after Smith had trouble finding work after graduating from university. He also suffered from a degenerative condition that eventually left him legally blind. While at his church in Williamsburg, Virginia, his pastor inspired him with a reference to how Jesus made himself poor to make others rich through him. When Smith started performing the song in church, a visiting United States Military officer took the song to Europe, from where its popularity spread. In 1986, Integrity Music published the song on their Hosanna! Music audio cassette but credited it as \\"author unknown\\". Later that year, Don Moen released the song on his Give Thanks album. Smith contacted Integrity to inform them of his authorship and they said that they had been attempting to track him down.

The lyrics of \\"Give Thanks With a Grateful Heart\\" have been erroneously credited to Moen rather than Smith in some media reports.

In around the middle of the 11th century, Amalfian traders obtained permission from the Caliph to build the church of Sainte Marie-Latine next to the church of the Resurrection in Jerusalem, as well as a hospice for the accommodation of Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. The hospice-hospital was run by Benedictine monks. Prior to the First Crusade (1095-1099AD) and the capture of Jerusalem (1099AD) by the Western Europeans, this first Frankish hospice-hospital had no connections with any military order. Indeed, the 12th century historian William of Tyre writes about the existence of a monastery, belonging to the people of Amalfi, which took charge of the hospital and its chapel. The latter had been dedicated to the patriarch of Alexandria, John the Almoner (610–616). However in the early years of the 12th century, after the first crusade, the enigmatic figure of Pierre Gerard or Gerard Tenque appeared in Jerusalem, a personality swathed in legend. Neither his homeland, his family nor his education are known, yet according to all indications to date, it is he who founded the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (Latin: Ordo Fratrum Hospitalis Sancti Ioannis Hierosolymitani), also known as the Order of Saint John, Order of Hospitallers, Knights Hospitaller, Knights Hospitalier or Hospitaller.

Letwe U-Shaung-Lwe of Mindon.His father's name—title of a court minister—is spelled differently in different chronicles. Hmannan Yazawin (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 165) spells it လက်ဝဲ ဦးသျှောင်လွဲ; Yazawin Thit (Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 336) လက်ဝဲ ဦးသျှောင်ဆွဲ; Toungoo Yazawin (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 27) လက်ဝဲ ဥသျှောင်လွှဲ. He was likely born in the 1370s.Since Thinkhaya called Mohnyin Thado \\"younger brother\\" per (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 28), he was older than but of the same generation as Thado who was born in 1379. He had at least one younger brother, who later became known as Gov. Nawrahta of Paungde and Tharrawaddy.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 65, 166 Governor of Toungoo In 1420, King Minkhaung I of Ava (Inwa) appointed him governor of Toungoo (Taungoo), with the title of Thinkhaya.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 27Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 165 The king had been looking for a loyal and able governor for the restive region bordering the Hanthawaddy Kingdom (Pegu) with which Ava had been in a long drawn out war since 1385. At Toungoo, the new governor quickly brought law and order to the lawless region, with the help of his right-hand man Myat Hla, whom he appointed the chief magistrate of the region. He also patronized the Buddhist clergy, appointing the abbot of the Maha Wun monastery to be the chief abbot of the region. Four years into his term, Thinkhaya had completely turned around the region, bringing a degree of peace and prosperity. Thinkhaya power grew further in 1425 when Ava entered a series of succession crises. That year, Queen Shin Bo-Me engineered the assassinations of kings Thihathu and Min Hla within three months of each other, and placed her lover Gov. Min Nyo of Kale on the throne in November 1425. The takeover was contested by Gov. Thado of Mohnyin who marched to Ava in February 1426. Initially, Thinkhaya, along with the rulers of other southern vassal states, agreed to support the new king at Ava. They even went to the Ava region to defend against the Mohnyin forces.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 59 But when the tide of war turned in favor of Mohnyin, Thinkhaya and other rulers retreated to their respective regions, taking their troops back with them.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 60 Ava defenses soon collapsed, and the Mohnyin forces entered the capital. Thado proclaimed himself king on 16 May 1426.Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 272 King of Toungoo =Break from Ava= At first, Thinkhaya was unsure of the new king. When Thado ordered the southern vassal rulers to Ava, he reluctantly went there, bringing a small retinue led by Myat Hla. At Ava, Thado tried to woo the vassal rulers for their support. Thinkhaya pledged support to the king but he and Myat Hla also assessed that Thado's army was not strong enough. Several vassal rulers apparently made the same assessment. Rulers of Toungoo, Taungdwin, Thissein, Yenantha, Pinle and Onbaung all revolted soon after they got back to their home region.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 64, 66Harvey 1925: 97 According to the chronicle Toungoo Yazawin, Thinkhaya sent a formal letter to Thado, addressing the latter as \\"younger brother\\", and declaring is independence from Ava as well as his preparedness to go to war, if necessary.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 28 Thinkhaya had an implicit ally in King Binnya Ran I of Hanthawaddy Pegu. Although Ran had signed a peace treaty with King Thihathu of Ava just three years earlier, the Hanthawaddy king decided to support the insurrections. Ran readily gave shelter to Thinkhaya's younger brother, Gov. Nawrahta of Paungde, who defected January 1427(Hmannan Vol. 2 65): About eight months into Thado's regin, which means January 1427. after his superior Gov. Min Maha of Prome sided with Thado. Ran seized the southernmost district of Prome, Tharrawaddy, and made Nawrahta governor of Tharrawaddy. Ava could not respond at all as it was facing more serious rebellions closer to home.(Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 67): The most serious rebellion was at Pinle, 40 km southeast of Ava. The rebellion was led by Prince Minye Kyawhtin, son of Crown Prince Minye Kyawswa and grandson of King Minkhaung I. =Expansion= Taking full advantage of Ava's troubles, Thinkhaya consolidated his power. In 1428–29, he annexed the five irrigated zones of the Yamethin region immediately to Toungoo's north, and even raided the districts towards the Irrawaddy such as Natmauk and Kyaukpadaung. He next entered into a formal alliance with Pegu by sending his younger daughter Saw Min Aung to Binnya Ran in a marriage of state.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 166 The allies eyed Prome, the southernmost region still loyal to Ava.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 71 (In response, Thado appointed his son Thihathu governor of Prome, replacing loyal but old Min Maha, in 1429.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 68–69) In 1430, Pegu and Toungoo jointly invaded Prome. Thinkhaya himself led a 5000-strong army, while Ran sent an army of equal size led by Smin Bayan, and a 5000-man naval forces led by Binnya Ein. The joint forces defeated the Prome defense forces outside the city. The invasion armies and the Pegu flotilla proceeded to lay siege to the fortified city. Given troubles closer to home, Ava was unwilling to fight a drawn out war in the south, and reluctantly asked for terms. Ava directly negotiated with Pegu as Thado considered Thinkhaya and Nawrahta rebels. Thado was prepared to cede Tharrawaddy to Pegu but wanted Nawrahta (now governor of Tharrawaddy) returned. After a long drawn out negotiation which came to near collapse a few times,(Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 72) and (Harvey 1925: 98): Thado was initially so angry at Pegu's terms that he kept Pegu's envoys waiting for three months without audience. Ava and Pegu reached an agreement that ceded Tharrawaddy to Pegu, and returned the rebellious Nawrahta to Ava. Thado also sent Princess Soe Min Wimala Dewi to Pegu to wed Ran in a marriage of state.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 72–73Harvey 1925: 98 =Last years= The Ava-Pegu treaty effectively scuttled Thinkhaya's expansion plans. He had to evacuate the Prome territory after the agreement was signed.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 74 It is unclear what Thinkhaya made of the agreement that sent his brother to Ava, or what his relationship with Ran continued to be. But without Pegu's explicit support, his position weakened. He appeared to have lost control of the Yamethin region, which by 1433–34 was controlled by an eastern Shan state. To be sure, his control over Toungoo remained unchallenged. The peaceful and prosperous region continued to attract refugees from elsewhere.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 29 Nonetheless Thinkhaya remained highly concerned about his fiefdom. According to Toungoo Yazawin, when he built a new palace, he refused to install the white umbrella (Hti byu), a key part of the regalia of Burmese sovereigns, perhaps not to attract unwanted attention. History shows that his concerns were not unfounded: Toungoo formally became a vassal of Pegu within the year of his death. He died in 1435 during a routine hunting trip. When his son-in-law Uzana seized the throne, his only son Saw Oo sought Ran's help. In 1436, Ran came up with an army to Toungoo, and installed Saw Oo as viceroy.
