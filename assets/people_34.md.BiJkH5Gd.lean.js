However, proteins are not strictly static objects, but rather populate ensembles of (sometimes similar) conformations. Transitions between these states occur on a variety of length scales (tenths of Å to nm) and time scales (ns to s), and have been linked to functionally relevant phenomena such as allosteric signaling and enzyme catalysis. The study of protein dynamics is most directly concerned with the transitions between these states, but can also involve the nature and equilibrium populations of the states themselves. These two perspectives—kinetics and thermodynamics, respectively—can be conceptually synthesized in an \\"energy landscape\\" paradigm: highly populated states and the kinetics of transitions between them can be described by the depths of energy wells and the heights of energy barriers, respectively. Kinesin walking on a microtubule. It is a molecular biological machine that uses protein domain dynamics on nanoscales  Local flexibility: atoms and residues  Portions of protein structures often deviate from the equilibrium state. Some such excursions are harmonic, such as stochastic fluctuations of chemical bonds and bond angles. Others are anharmonic, such as sidechains that jump between separate discrete energy minima, or rotamers. Evidence for local flexibility is often obtained from NMR spectroscopy. Flexible and potentially disordered regions of a protein can be detected using the random coil index. Flexibility in folded proteins can be identified by analyzing the spin relaxation of individual atoms in the protein. Flexibility can also be observed in very high-resolution electron density maps produced by X-ray crystallography, particularly when diffraction data is collected at room temperature instead of the traditional cryogenic temperature (typically near 100 K). Information on the frequency distribution and dynamics of local protein flexibility can be obtained using Raman and optical Kerr-effect spectroscopy in the terahertz frequency domain.  Regional flexibility: intra-domain multi-residue coupling  A network of alternative conformations in catalase (Protein Data Bank code: 1gwe) with diverse properties. Multiple phenomena define the network: van der Waals interactions (blue dots and line segments) between sidechains, a hydrogen bond (dotted green line) through a partial-occupancy water (brown), coupling through the locally mobile backbone (black), and perhaps electrostatic forces between the Lys (green) and nearby polar residues (blue: Glu, yellow: Asp, purple: Ser). This particular network is distal from the active site and is therefore putatively not critical for function. Many residues are in close spatial proximity in protein structures. This is true for most residues that are contiguous in the primary sequence, but also for many that are distal in sequence yet are brought into contact in the final folded structure. Because of this proximity, these residue's energy landscapes become coupled based on various biophysical phenomena such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and van der Waals interactions (see figure). Transitions between states for such sets of residues therefore become correlated. This is perhaps most obvious for surface-exposed loops, which often shift collectively to adopt different conformations in different crystal structures (see figure). However, coupled conformational heterogeneity is also sometimes evident in secondary structure. For example, consecutive residues and residues offset by 4 in the primary sequence often interact in α helices. Also, residues offset by 2 in the primary sequence point their sidechains toward the same face of β sheets and are close enough to interact sterically, as are residues on adjacent strands of the same β sheet. An \\"ensemble\\" of 44 crystal structures of hen egg white lysozyme from the Protein Data Bank, showing that different crystallization conditions lead to different conformations for various surface-exposed loops and termini (red arrows). When these coupled residues form pathways linking functionally important parts of a protein, they may participate in allosteric signaling. For example, when a molecule of oxygen binds to one subunit of the hemoglobin tetramer, that information is allosterically propagated to the other three subunits, thereby enhancing their affinity for oxygen. In this case, the coupled flexibility in hemoglobin allows for cooperative oxygen binding, which is physiologically useful because it allows rapid oxygen loading in lung tissue and rapid oxygen unloading in oxygen-deprived tissues (e.g. muscle).  Global flexibility: multiple domains  The presence of multiple domains in proteins gives rise to a great deal of flexibility and mobility, leading to protein domain dynamics. Domain motions can be inferred by comparing different structures of a protein (as in Database of Molecular Motions), or they can be directly observed using spectra measured by neutron spin echo spectroscopy. They can also be suggested by sampling in extensive molecular dynamics trajectories and principal component analysis. Domain motions are important for: * ABC transporters * catalysis * cellular locomotion and motor proteins * formation of protein complexes * ion channels * mechanoreceptors and mechanotransduction * regulatory activity * transport of metabolites across cell membranes One of the largest observed domain motions is the 'swivelling' mechanism in pyruvate phosphate dikinase. The phosphoinositide domain swivels between two states in order to bring a phosphate group from the active site of the nucleotide binding domain to that of the phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate domain. The phosphate group is moved over a distance of 45 Å involving a domain motion of about 100 degrees around a single residue. In enzymes, the closure of one domain onto another captures a substrate by an induced fit, allowing the reaction to take place in a controlled way. A detailed analysis by Gerstein led to the classification of two basic types of domain motion; hinge and shear. Only a relatively small portion of the chain, namely the inter-domain linker and side chains undergo significant conformational changes upon domain rearrangement. =Hinges by secondary structures= A study by Hayward found that the termini of α-helices and β-sheets form hinges in a large number of cases. Many hinges were found to involve two secondary structure elements acting like hinges of a door, allowing an opening and closing motion to occur. This can arise when two neighbouring strands within a β-sheet situated in one domain, diverge apart as they join the other domain. The two resulting termini then form the bending regions between the two domains. α-helices that preserve their hydrogen bonding network when bent are found to behave as mechanical hinges, storing \`elastic energy' that drives the closure of domains for rapid capture of a substrate. =Helical to extended conformation= The interconversion of helical and extended conformations at the site of a domain boundary is not uncommon. In calmodulin, torsion angles change for five residues in the middle of a domain linking α-helix. The helix is split into two, almost perpendicular, smaller helices separated by four residues of an extended strand. =Shear motions= Shear motions involve a small sliding movement of domain interfaces, controlled by the amino acid side chains within the interface. Proteins displaying shear motions often have a layered architecture: stacking of secondary structures. The interdomain linker has merely the role of keeping the domains in close proximity. =Domain motion and functional dynamics in enzymes= The analysis of the internal dynamics of structurally different, but functionally similar enzymes has highlighted a common relationship between the positioning of the active site and the two principal protein sub-domains. In fact, for several members of the hydrolase superfamily, the catalytic site is located close to the interface separating the two principal quasi-rigid domains. Such positioning appears instrumental for maintaining the precise geometry of the active site, while allowing for an appreciable functionally oriented modulation of the flanking regions resulting from the relative motion of the two sub-domains.  Implications for macromolecular evolution  Evidence suggests that protein dynamics are important for function, e.g. enzyme catalysis in DHFR, yet they are also posited to facilitate the acquisition of new functions by molecular evolution. This argument suggests that proteins have evolved to have stable, mostly unique folded structures, but the unavoidable residual flexibility leads to some degree of functional promiscuity, which can be amplified/harnessed/diverted by subsequent mutations. However, there is growing awareness that intrinsically unstructured proteins are quite prevalent in eukaryotic genomes, casting further doubt on the simplest interpretation of Anfinsen's dogma: \\"sequence determines structure (singular)\\". In effect, the new paradigm is characterized by the addition of two caveats: \\"sequence and cellular environment determine structural ensemble\\".

It was introduced in early 1995, debuting in systems from HP. The PA-7200 was not sold openly and the only third-party users were Convex Computer and Stratus Computer, both members of the Precision RISC Organization (PRO). It was developed for small multiprocessing systems with two or four microprocessors. The microprocessor was first described at the Compcon and IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) conferences.  Description  Die shot of PA-7200 The PA-7200 was mostly derived from the PA-7100 and was improved adding a second integer unit, enabling it to issue up to two integer instructions per cycle. The second integer unit was not identical to the first, and was only capable of executing simple but more frequently used instructions. The PA-7200 contained 1.3 million transistors and measured 14.0 mm by 15.0 mm (210 mm2).\\"Design of the HP PA 7200 CPU\\", p. 2.

CMOS14A was a 0.55 µm, three-level interconnect, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. The microprocessor uses an unusual 4.4 V power supply as a result of its development. It was designed in the 0.8 µm CMOS26B process and leveraged circuits and layouts from the PA-7100, which was also designed for CMOS26B. The completed design was then shrunk for the 0.55 µm CMOS14A process. This process has 120-angstrom gate oxide that did not tolerate 5.0 V operation. A 3.3 V power supply did not enable the microprocessor to achieve the intended clock frequency, so 4.4 V was chosen as a compromise.  Notes  References  * Chan, Kenneth K.; et al.

Their comeback began when Soundicate/Makasound, a record label in France, released an album in 2004 and followed it up with another in 2007 (both were compilations made up from their extensive back catalogue). In December 2010 they performed their first live show for some twenty years at the Trinity Hall in Bristol and since then they have been active once again, playing live dates and releasing a new album. History The original line-up of the band included Errol Brown (vocals), Delroy O'Gilvie (vocals), Kondwani Ngozi (congas, vocals), Jabulani Ngozi (rhythm guitar), Cordell Francis (lead guitar), Trevor Seivwright (drums), and Derrick King (bass guitar).

They toured Europe with Eek-A-Mouse and Linton Kwesi Johnson, and performed at the WOMAD Festival in 1985. The band's third album, All Day All Night was produced by Mad Professor and featured Vin Gordon. Several more albums followed, the last, Natural Reaction, in 1990. The band then ceased to exist as a touring concern, although several dub albums were released based on their earlier work over the next five years. Nubian Records released Dub Factor – The Mad Professor Mixes in 1991, Dub Factor 2 – The Dub Judah Mixes in 1994 and Dub Factor 3 – Dub Chronicles The Mad Professor and Dub Judah Mixes in 1995. The final studio album release from the band, during the period, came in 1993, it was a reworking of earlier recordings produced by Dub Judah, entitled Black Roots with Friends featuring vocals by B.B. Seaton, Trevor Dixon, Dub Judah, Mikey Forbes and a cameo performance by Delroy Ogilvie. Then activity ceases completely for several years. French label Makasound released a compilation of the band's first two albums on a fourteen- track CD titled On The Frontline on 4 July 2004. It was followed on 25 November 2007 with a reissue of In Session. On the back of these releases the band did some live shows in France. Bristol Archive Records approached the band and offered to re-release some more of their back catalogue. They first released a compilation of the band's singles entitled The Reggae Singles Anthology on double vinyl, CD and digital download on 5 September 2011 that included a re-mastered version of the Celebration video recording on DVD and followed this with a reissue on CD of All Day All Night on 23 April 2012 with bonus tracks. In April 2012 the band record new material for an album, On The Ground, that was co-released by Sugar Shack Records and Nubian Records on 10 September 2012. The album was produced by Jeff Spencer and Black Roots and mixed by Louis Beckett. The album featured the four original vocalists — Delroy Ogilvie, Carlton Smith, Errol Brown and Kondwani Ngozi — as well as two of the musicians from the original line up, guitarists Cordell Francis and Jabulani Ngozi. It was followed by the dub version On The Ground in Dub, also on Sugar Shack and Nubian Records that was released on 4 March 2013. The band released a second album of new recordings via French record company Soulbeats Records on 23 September 2014 entitled Ghetto Feel. This album is also produced by Jeff Spencer and Black Roots and mixed by Louis Beckett. This release has been followed by a third album of new studio recordings produced and mixed by the same team as Ghetto Feel called Son Of Man and released by Soulbeats Records on 22 January 2016. Black Roots released a single on 22 August 2016 entitled Move On EP on their own label Nubian Records on digital download only. It contains 5 mixes of Move On, a song first recorded and released by the band in 1981 on their debut 12\\" vinyl record that coincidentally was also the first record they released on their own label Nubian Records. This was followed by another digital only single release on Nubian in 2017 titled I Believe, containing 4 mixes of this song taken off the On The Ground album.

It occurs in the drier parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. It grows in places like sandy creek beds and rocky gorges but it may have potential as a more productive source of \\"tea tree\\" oil than the usual Melaleuca alternifolia. It is closely related and very similar to Melaleuca linophylla with its papery bark, narrow leaves and loose spikes of creamy-white flowers but its flowers are larger, the stamens are longer and there are more stamens per bundle than in that species. Description Melaleuca dissitiflora is usually a tall, bushy shrub which grows to high, wide and has grey papery bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, glabrous except when very young, linear to elliptic in shape and tapering to a point. The flowers are white to cream-coloured and are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are up to in diameter, long and contain between 10 and 30 individual flowers. The petals are arranged in five bundles around the flower with 15 to 35 stamens per bundle. The flowering season is variable but often occurs in winter. The fruit that follow are woody capsules, long arranged in roughly spherical clusters around the stem. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca dissitiflora was first formally described in 1863 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected by the explorer John McDouall Stuart. The specific epithet (dissitiflora) is from the Latin dissitus, meaning \\"apart\\" or \\"remote\\" and flos meaning \\"flower\\", referring to the flowers being in loose clusters in the inflorescence. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca dissitiflora is found in the drier parts of inland Australia such as Flinders Ranges in South Australia. It is also found in the Northern Territory and western Queensland and there is a disjunct population in the Rawlinson Range in Western Australia near its border with the Northern Territory. It grows in rocky places, in ephemeral watercourses and alluvium. UsesHorticulture= Melaleuca dissitiflora has been cultivated in a few places, including where rainfall is as little as a year. It is reportedly a fast-growing, frost resistant species =Essential oils= This species' leaves yield significant amounts of essential oils such as 1,8-cineole (Eucalyptol). Experiments trees of this species in the dry environment near Alice Springs revealed that many produced an essential oil with levels of terpinen-4-ol and p-cymene higher than that found in commercial tea tree oil derived mainly from Melaleuca alternifolia.

Peanuts was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2009. He was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1979.  Background  Peanuts was a 1964 sorrel gelding quarter horse, best known as a rodeo horse in the steer wrestling event. He was also a racehorse, winning six times before beginning his rodeo career. \\"If you bet on that little horse, you won’t win peanuts.\\" Peanuts' owner C.R. Jones traces his nickname back to his racing days. The horse's jockey, Jack Robinson, referred to him as \\"Goober\\" and claimed the 875 pound horse was \\"no bigger than a peanut.\\" This quarter horse was by champion Breeze Bar out of Camelot Broom by Camelot's Little Cuero. Judd Morse of San Jacinto, California, bred him. When Peanuts reached three years of age, he was traded to a cowboy who later sold him to his most prominent and last owner. That owner was C.R. Jones of Lakeside, California. Jones was a professional steer wrestler. He hazed Peanuts for a year and then used him for steer wrestling.  Racing career  Out of all the horses the late Stan Immenschuh worked with, one of the ones he recalls most affectionately was Peanuts. \\"Peanuts first came into my life in January 1966, when I arrived at the Shamel Ranch in Murrieta, California, owned by breeder Judd Morse. Early one morning, I was there to load up a bunch of running horses to go to Bay Meadows Racetrack at San Mateo.\\" His then-wife and ranch trainer LaRae told him Peanuts would win his first start and the most races overall, which he found dubious given that the horse was still only 850 pounds. However, after a couple of weeks, \\"we all found that this little horse, Make It Do, might just do\\": in his first start, he left the gate quickly and won the race by a couple of lengths against good competitors. At the winner's circle, Jack Robinson, his first call jockey, said, \\"Stan, I don’t know how far he’ll run, but he can sure as hell leave that gate.\\" After that, Peanuts continued leaving the gate speedily and winning races. Out of 22 races, he won six of them and earned $5,792. Immenschuh said, \\"When Peanuts turned 3 years old, he finally started to grow and changed into a horse that would later be stout enough to carry a 'big cowboy' to a steer.\\" His ankle started bothering him, so Immenschuh turned him out for a bit, then traded him to a cowboy named Bob Barnes, who later sold him to C.R. Jones. Immenschuh recalled, \\"I picked up the Sports News the other day to read that Peanuts had won another world championship. I thought now 16 years old, Make It Do — alias Peanuts — made it do one more time.\\"  Rodeo career  Peanuts competed in the Rodeo Cowboys Association and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) when they changed their name in 1975. Immenschuh only had Peanuts when he was racing, but Immenschuh had a rodeo background too. He claims when Peanuts was racing he was small but he was \\"a smart horse, one of a kind\\". When he started bulldogging, he took to the sport right away. His owner C.R. Jones would put a lot of bulldoggers on him in one rodeo. Immenschuh recalled how he was over at Sunland Park in El Paso, Texas, and attended the rodeo slack. Jones had 12 bulldoggers ride Peanuts and Peanuts made the same run for each of them. According to Immenschuh's good friend and associate, hall of fame trainer Bubba Cascio, \\"Immenschuh got [Peanuts] broke and started the right way, so the horse had a good mind, had a good disposition, wanted to do right for whoever was riding him. Nothin’ ever bothered Peanuts and that’s why he became such a great bulldoggin’ horse.\\" Peanuts took many notable cowboys to winning world titles in the PRCA. Tom Ferguson, of Miami, Oklahoma, won six consecutive World All-Around Championships and three World Steer Wrestling Championships. Frank Shepperson and Bob Marshall both won World Steer Wrestling Championships. Ten other cowboys rode Peanuts at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR). Peanuts won the PRCA steer wrestling title four consecutive years from 1976 to 1979. At the Calgary Stampede he won the average for five consecutive years. Peanuts qualified for the NFR from 1973 to 1980. For each of those years, a minimum of five top 15 cowboys rode him according to the horses's obituary. For his total participation at the NFR, they estimated that in 450 runs, the cowboys wrestled 225 consecutive steers from Peanuts' back without missing one.  Retirement and death  Jones retired Peanut in 1981 in a small plot at his home near Lakeside, California. Over $1 million in earnings was claimed on Peanuts in rodeos throughout the United States and Canada. Until 1977 there was no recognition of notable steer wrestling horses. That changed in 1977 when steer wrestler/roper Corky Warren established an annual trophy in memory of his wife. That year the top 30 money winners voted on Peanuts to receive the inaugural trophy for the 1977-78 season. Make It Do was euthanized in 1995 due to complications from intestine issues.

Plot An unseen dangerous patient escapes Greenwood Mental Hospital killing or injuring two staff. Soon afterwards, in a private house, a couple discovers that their bedroom has been burgled. A motorist stops at a telephone box, and his unattended car is stolen by an unseen thief who runs over the owner, killing him. The next day a man in his thirties, Stephen Slade, notices an attractive young woman, Belle Adams, in a pub, and when she is given a lift by a lorry driver, he follows her in his own car, which is the same color and make (an Austin Maxi} as seen in the earlier murder scene. The lorry driver attempts to rape the girl but she escapes and is rescued by Stephen. Belle wishes to catch a train at a nearby station and Stephen drives her there; but on arrival he untruthfully claims her train is not running and offers to drive her to her destination instead. With Stephen not being too forthcoming on his own background, the trip focuses on what they are both hiding. Flashbacks gradually reveal that Stephen is a voyeur deeply into sexual perversions, and that Belle is an orphan who was a victim of sexual abuse on the part of her uncle who used to watch her undress through peepholes in the wall and walk in on her as she bathed. At an isolated petrol station manned only by one young woman, Stephen fills up his tank, disappears for a while in the petrol station ostensibly to make a telephone call, and then rejoins Belle in the car, and they drive off. The next scene shows the petrol station attendant murdered. On the road, Stephen and Belle are keen to avoid police checks and roadblocks, at first because Stephen was drinking alcohol, and then because the couple are harassed by two young motorcyclists and Stephen knocks one of them into the roadside where he lies motionless, presumably injured or dead. To avoid detection Stephen and Belle sleep in the car. On waking the next morning, Stephen notices Belle has disappeared and drives off to find her, assuming disloyalty. She however has simply been shopping for breakfast and so is obliged to catch a lift from aging Malcolm Robarts. Before long Stephen reunites with Belle, leaving Robarts alone. Upon seeing a newspaper headline, Robarts tries to chase them but loses them. The film culminates with the couple spending the night at a hotel. A flashback reveals the truth: after sexual abuse by her uncle during her orphaned childhood, Belle snapped and murdered her uncle, which resulted in her confinement in Greenwood Mental Hospital. Now, Belle is finally arrested by the police, but not before she murders Stephen. The title is explained: they were both deadly strangers.

The PA-7100LC is a microprocessor that implements the PA-RISC 1.1 instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Hewlett- Packard (HP). It is also known as the PCX-L, and by its code-name, Hummingbird. It was designed as a low-cost microprocessor for low-end systems. The first systems to feature the PA-7100LC were introduced in January 1994. These systems used 60 and 80 MHz parts. A 100 MHz part debuted in June 1994. The PA-7100LC was the first PA-RISC microprocessor to implement the MAX-1 multimedia instructions, an early single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) multimedia instruction set extension that provided instructions for improving the performance of MPEG video decoding. Die shot of PA-7100LC. The PA-7100LC was based on the PA-7100. Major improvements were improved superscalar execution and an extra integer unit. The PA-7100LC also implemented architectural improvements including the MAX-1 multimedia instructions, uncacheable memory pages, and bi-endian support. Superscalar execution was improved by adding the extra integer unit and modifying the control logic so that two integer instructions, two load-store units, or an integer and a load- store can be issued in one cycle in addition to the existing instruction combinations supported by the PA-7100. A number of modifications were made to circuits derived from the PA-7100LC. Prominently, the floating-point unit multiplier was modified to take up less area by halving the tree of carry-save adders that summed the partial products of the mantissa. This simplification left the latency of single precision multiplies unchanged (two cycles), but increased the latency of double precision multiplies to three cycles. The performance loss was deemed acceptable as the PA-7100LC was designed for mid- range multimedia workstations where single-precision multiplies are more prevalent. Integrated on-die to lower costs is a memory controller that supports up to 2 GB of memory and an I/O controller. The organization of the caches is different from that of most HP-designed PA-RISC CPUs. The large external instruction and data caches have been replaced by an on-die instruction cache with a 1 KB capacity and a large external 8 KB to 2 MB cache. The external cache is unified, containing both instructions and data. The PA-7100LC consists of 900,000 transistors and measures 14.2 by 14.2 mm for an area of 201.64 mm2. It was fabricated by HP in their 0.8 μm three-level metal CMOS26B process. The PA-7100LC is packaged in a 432-pin ceramic pin grid array. PA-7300LC A PA-7300LC microprocessor. The PA-7300LC was a further development of the PA-7100LC. It was introduced in mid-1996 as a low-end to mid-range microprocessor complementing the high-end PA-8000 in HP's workstations and servers. The PA-7300LC integrates an improved PA-7100LC, 64 KB instruction and data caches, L2 cache controller, memory controller and a GSC bus controller onto a single chip. It was the first PA-RISC microprocessor to include any significant amount of on-chip cache. The L2 unified cache was optional and could be protected by parity. It could be built from register-to- register, flow-through or asynchronous SRAM. Die shot of PA-7300LC. The PA-7300LC contained 9.2 million transistors, of which 1.2 million are used in logic and 8 million are used in the caches; and measured 15.3 by 17.0 mm for an area of 260.1 mm2. It was fabricated by HP in their CMOS14C process, a 0.5 µm, 3.3 V, four-layer-metal CMOS process. References * Gwennap, Linley (24 January 1994). \\"New PA-RISC Processor Decodes MPEG Video\\".

She was the first blind actress to be cast in a British soap opera, playing the fictional character Lizzie Lakely in Emmerdale from April 2009 to March 2013. Life and career Born in Bramley, Leeds, McGeever grew up in Liversedge and Farsley, West Yorkshire. She changed her name from Catherine Mitchell to Kitty McGeever as there was already an actress named Catherine Mitchell. She trained at RADA and was diagnosed as diabetic at the age of 19. McGeever became pregnant in 2001, but developed pre-eclampsia. Her son Felix was born two months early; he spent some time in a special care baby unit. At the age of four months, he suddenly became very ill, having problems with his heart and lungs. During her son's illness, McGeever also became ill due to the stress—her kidneys stopped working, she had heart trouble and diabetic retinopathy caused her to begin to lose her sight. Laser treatment was ineffective; five months later she was blind at the age of 32. Her son Felix died in January 2003, aged fifteen months. She was given a kidney transplant in a successful 12-hour operation. Following her recovery, she contacted her agent in 2008 and suggested that she was ready to begin performing again and would consider television. She was spotted by production staff from the soap Emmerdale when she was appearing in a one-woman stage show where she talked about her life as a blind woman. They approached her with a view to creating an authentic blind character for Emmerdale, to be played by McGeever, who would also develop the part. She first appeared as former criminal Lizzie Lakely in Emmerdale on 28 April 2009, at the age of 42; Lakely was the first permanent blind character in a British soap. She was given her scripts as sound recordings and had two government-sponsored assistants to guide her around the studios; they also guided her through the sets during rehearsals and ensured continuity between recordings. On 5 January 2010, McGeever appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme In Touch, when she talked to Peter White about losing her sight. She revealed that she had a number of gadgets to assist her, including a CD storage system where audible labels can be recorded, a colour detector to assist with choosing a coordinating outfit and a pair of long-armed oven gloves. In February 2013, it was reported that McGeever had been hospitalised and awaiting a heart transplant. Her sister, Emmerdale scriptwriter Caroline Mitchell, denied her sister was awaiting a heart transplant, but stated that she was on the transplant register. Death McGeever died on 16 August 2015, aged 48. It was confirmed that she had been waiting for a kidney transplant and had asked for her organs to be donated to help others. Her final movie was Eugene McGing's 2016 horror movie The Unfolding.

Mademoiselle d'Armagnac Marie was the ninth of fourteen children born to Louis of Lorraine, Count of Armagnac and Catherine de Neufville.

Court gossips later stated that the match had been a scheme of Madame de Maintenon, who feared that if she did not remove Marie from court she would become mistress to the king. However Madame de Maintenon wrote that Marie was one of the most \\"likeable women in the kingdom\\".Vatout, Jean, Le château d'Eu: notices historiques, Volume 4, 1836, p. 284 Saint-Simon described her in his Memoirs: \\"the duchesse de Valentinois was a charming young thing... spoilt by her parents' fondness for her and by the attentions of the courtiers who frequented the Lorraine household ... [The beautiful daughters] who were its chief adornment attracted the most glittering young men. Her husband, very sensibly, realised he hadn't the upper hand\\", and Madame de La Fayette described her as \\"more of an elegant flirt than all of the ladies of the kingdom put together\\". Marie was sent to Monaco by her consort during his military service in 1692, where she was joined by her spouse some time later. There was a great scandal when she claimed that her father in law, the elderly Prince Louis I, had made unwanted sexual advances towards her, possibly as a way to receive permission to return to Paris, which she did in 1693 and remained for the next four years; the couple returned to Monaco in 1697. After it was clear that Marie was not going to give birth to a son, her husband began a series of badly concealed affairs. Her husband fathered numerous illegitimate children during the marriage. Princess of Monaco At the death of her father-in-law, her husband succeeded to the principality of Monaco in 1701. She lived in Monaco with her consort until 1712 and their relationship was described as unhappy but peaceful. In reality, they lived apart; Antoine in the Giardinetto, a cottage he had built for his lover, Mademoiselle Montespan, and Marie in her pavilion, Mon Desert. Marie spent the last years of her life quietly, frequently returning to the French court. She died at the Prince's Palace in Monaco, having organised the marriages of her two surviving daughters, Louise Hippolyte and Margherita. She was buried at the Saint Nicholas Cathedral in Monaco. Her husband died in 1731 and was succeeded by their daughter Louise Hippolyte Grimaldi who became Princess of Monaco in her own right.

Federal service The 188th New York left the state to join the Army of the Potomac on October 13, 1864. Initially, only seven companies left the state but company K followed in November. The army was before Petersburg, Virginia, at that time. The regiment was placed in 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps then under Major General Gouverneur Warren. The 188th New York remained in this assignment for its entire federal service. On October 27, less than a month after first muster, the regiment went into battle at Hatcher's Run near the Weldon Railroad. The regiment suffered 7 dead and between 39 and 46 wounded (depending on reports). On December 8, 1864, the regiment participated on a raid to Hicksford, Virginia, where two soldiers were taken prisoner. February 6 and 7, 1865 saw the regiment at Hatcher's Run again. During this battle the regiment suffered 5 dead, 21 wounded, and 3 missing. The Appomattox campaign saw the regiment fight with its corps at White Oak ridge, Gravelly Run and Five Forks, when its casualties aggregated 45 killed and wounded. The 188th New York also participated in the final assault on Petersburg and was present at Appomattox Station on April 9 when General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia. According to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, it reported that the 188th was the regiment that \\"busted up the confederacy.\\" They were given the honor of posting guard duty around the court house while Lee surrendered the confederacy to Grant. Deactivation The regiment was mustered out of federal service on July 1, 1865, at Washington, D.C., with less than the planned one year of service.

Early life Nathaniel Sylvester was born in 1610 in England.Jennifer Schuessler, Confronting Slavery at Long Island’s Oldest Estates, The New York Times, August 12, 2015 His family lived in exile in Holland before he emigrated to British America during the English Civil War and Anglo-Dutch War. Career In June 1651, with his brother, Constant, and partners, Thomas Middleton and Thomas Rouse, he purchased the whole of Shelter Island first from a non- resident Englishman and then again the next year, from the Manhanset Indians, whose sachem, or chief, was called \\"Yoki.\\" Nathaniel was the only one of the partners who lived on a Shelter Island, and he eventually bought out his partners’ shares. The Shelter Island enterprise involved barrel-making, using the stands of local white oak for shipping the West Indies tobacco, sugar, molasses and rum back to England. The family kept African slaves, along with employing Native Americans and others, to help run the plantation, the largest such operation in the north. Personal life Between 6 July (date of marriage jointure) and 8 August 1653 (date of letter mentioning his changed condition because of marriage), he married Grisell Brinley, daughter of Thomas Brinley, one of the Auditors General of the Revenues for Charles I, and later for Charles II. Grisell was a younger sister of Anne Brinley, who in England had married Governor William Coddington of Rhode Island in January 1650. When the Coddingtons returned to Rhode Island in mid-1651, Grizzell came along as a ward of Coddington. Grisell and Anne’s brother, Francis, would also join his sisters in the New World, fleeing Cromwell’s England, and establishing the American Brinleys in Newport, RI and Boston, Mass. Another Brinley sister, Mary, would marry Nathaniel's brother, Peter Sylvester. The Sylvesters were friends with Quaker founder George Fox, whom he entertained on at least one occasion on Shelter Island. They offered a place of refuge for several of the persecuted early Quakers in New England at a time when it was dangerous to do so. Death He died in 1680. Legacy His grandson, Brinley Sylvester, replaced the existing home and built Sylvester Manor on Shelter Island in 1737, which remains standing and in the family to this day.Anne Raver, Life on the Plantation: Sylvester Manor on Shelter Island Returns to Its Roots, The New York Times, April 10, 2013 An 11th generation descendant, Bennet Konesni, turned it into a non-profit farm. Shelter Island families descended from Sylvester include Dering, Sprague, L'Hommedieu, Havens and Hudson. Franklin Delano Roosevelt (32nd President of the United States) was Nathaniel and Grisell Sylvester’s sixth great-grandson, through their eldest child Grisell Sylvester Lloyd. A contemporary archaeological dig, from 1999-2005, called the Sylvester Manor Project, a project overseen by the University of Massachusetts Boston, seeks to shed light on the Sylvester estate as it existed in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Description A Gardener. Hendrick Danckerts, Royal Gardener John Rose and King Charles II, 1675 Gardener on a stepladder collecting fruit c.1910 A gardener is any person involved in gardening, arguably the oldest occupation, from the hobbyist in a residential garden, the home-owner supplementing the family food with a small vegetable garden or orchard, to an employee in a plant nursery or the head gardener in a large estate. Garden design and maintenance The garden designer is someone who will design the garden, and the gardener is the person who will undertake the work to produce the desired outcome. Design The term gardener is also used to describe garden designers and landscape architects, who are involved chiefly in the design of gardens, rather than the practical aspects of horticulture. Garden design is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means garden maintenance. Vita Sackville-West, Gertrude Jekyll and William Robinson were garden designers as well as gardeners. Garden design is the creation of a plan for the construction of a garden, in a design process. The product is the garden, and the garden designers attempt to optimize the given general conditions of the soil, location and climate, ecological, and geological conditions and processes to choose the right plants in corresponding conditions. The design can include different themes such as perennial, butterfly, wildlife, Japanese, water, tropical, or shade gardens. In 18th-century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into formal gardens or landscaped park lands, such as at Versailles, France, or Stowe, England. Today, landscape architects and garden designers continue to design both private garden spaces, residential estates and parkland, public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks. Professional landscape designers are certified by the Association of Professional Landscape Designers. Maintenance The designer also provides directions and supervision during construction, and the management of establishment and maintenance once the garden has been created. The gardener is the person who has the skill to maintain the garden's design. The gardener's labor during the year include planting flowers and other plants, weeding, pruning, grafting, deadheading, mixing and preparation of insecticides and other products for pest control, and tending garden compost. Weeds tend to thrive at the expense of the more refined edible or ornamental plants. Gardeners need to control weeds using physical or chemical methods to stop weeds from reaching a mature stage of growth when they could be harmful to domesticated plants. Early activities such as starting young plants from seeds for later transplantation are usually performed in early spring.

It competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.  Plot  The film is set between the years 1566 and 1569 during the era of the Oprichnina and the Livonian War. The film starts from the time when the Russian Orthodox Metropolitan Afanasii has died and Tsar Ivan IV has summoned his childhood friend, Hegumen Philip Kolychev of Solovetsky Monastery. The film is divided into four parts. # The prayer of the Tsar. The Tsar is praying in his cell and asked the Lord to help him in his business. Meanwhile, Hegumen Philip arrives in Moscow, and on the way rescues a girl Masha, who is fleeing from a group of guardsmen. Receiving the Hegumen when he arrives, the Tsar invites him to become Metropolitan of Moscow, but Philip initially declines. The Hegumen meets his nephew, who is leaving for the wars and urges the Hegumen to flee from the Tsar, as those around him cannot survive. The Tsar returns to Philip, gives Masha an icon of the Mother of God, and persuades Hegumen Philip to become Metropolitan. Philip, witnessing the horrors being committed by the Oprichniki, urges the Tsar to show mercy to his enemies. # The Tsar at War. Metropolitan Philip's nephew fights in a bloody battle against the Poles and Lithuanians at Polotsk. There is also Masha, who has escaped from the Tsar and brought the icon. Thanks to the icon, the bridge collapses under the Lithuanian cavalry. Polotsk governor returns to Moscow, but news arrives that the Lithuanian and Polish forces went around to the rear of the city and that the Governor himself surrendered the town. The enraged Tsar desires to execute all the Governor's men. Metropolitan Philip defends them, which also triggers the wrath of the Tsar. The governor is arrested, and Malyuta Skuratov brands his chest. # The Tsar's Wrath. The Tsar orders Metropolitan Philip to judge the governor, and the court convicts the governor's men of treason. Realizing that the defendants are speaking the truth, Metropolitan Philip refuses to sign the death warrant. Meanwhile, the Tsar prepares their execution: he pits them one on one against a bear. Killing two commanders, bear attacks Kolycheva. At this point, Masha runs into the arena with the icon and tries to stop the bear. It kills Masha with his paw. Metropolitan Philip, horrified by the senseless brutality of the Tsar, seeing the futility of their attempts to persuade the Tsar to give up violence, enters the arena, and raises the icon. During a service at the Church, he refuses to bless the Tsar, who furiously strips the Metropolitan of his rank and forces him to watch the execution of his nephew on the rack. The Tsar decides to pardon Philip himself, but forever exiles him to a monastery, where he is treated as an ordinary prisoner, shackled, deprived of even water. # The Tsar's fun. Heinrich von Staden builds a \\"torture camp\\", which is planned to convene the people to festivals and watch the torture of prisoners. During the inspection, the Tsar's jester Vassian quotes the Book of Revelation, comparing Maria Temryukovna with the Whore of Babylon, for which the Tsar burns him at the stake. Meanwhile, in the monastery Philip's chains are supernaturally loosened, and he receives the gift of healing and foresight. He warns Archbishop Pimen that they will be accused in his death. Philip encourages them to run and save themselves. However, the abbot, and almost all the monks stay with him. The Tsar arrives, but Philip again accuses him of horrific violence and refuses him a blessing. On the orders of the Tsar, Skuratov strangles Philip with his own hands. Despite the order to hand over Philip's corpse, the monks bury Philip in a wooden church and lock it; guardsmen burn the church with the monks inside. # Final Scene -- The Tsar waits for the beginning of his tortures.

The movie is considered a pearl of Ukrainian cinema. The film is based on the novella The Lost Letter: A Tale Told by the Sexton of the N...Church by Nikolai Gogol from cycle Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka.  Synopsis  Cossack Vasyl (Ivan Mykolaichuk) prepares himself for a mounted voyage to Peterburg, the capital of the Russian Empire. Vasyl carries a hramota (sealed official document) given to him by the hetman through his secretary, Pereverny-Kruchenko, that is rumored to cost ten Poods of gold. Vasyl's wife sews the hramota into his hat and his father (Vasyl Symchych) gives him magic tobacco to repel evil and an advice to find a good co- journeyman. The film depicts the adventures of Vasyl in sequences that are filled with Ukrainian culture, and shows Ukrainian cuisine, costumes, traditions, mystical and comedy-filled situations, anecdotes, and a plethora of obstacles which Vasyl must overcome. On his way together with an evil servant (chort) he comes to a river crossing where a ferry carries people from one side to another. There he finds his partner in arms, Andriy, a zaporozhian cossack. Further along the way, something happens to the papers when they stop at an inn to rest. When Vasyl and Andriy arrive in St. Petersburg, they hand over the hramota to the baroness von Likhtenberg who passes them to the empress. The documents do not carry any information and Vasyl has to leave without results. On the way home, both of them decide to shoot each other. As they are saying in unison the Nicene Creed (Apostles' Creed) they hear a voice that identifies itself as Kudz coming from a nearby rock, saying he was the same chort and the witch turned him into a rock after he helped Vasyl. Kudz asks them to throw him in a nearby marsh so as not to cause any further harm to random travelers on the road. As Vasyl arrives with his friend near their village, Dykanka, they meet a little boy who asks them to let him go to see the cossack, Vasyl who had supposedly returned from having seen the empress. Then they arrive and are met by the rest of the village population. Moments later, everybody awaits Vasyl again by his house to tell the story of his rendezvous with the empress.

However, when Hres became suddenly ill, he offered it to Borys Ivchenko. The latter agreed on the condition that the main role would be given to Ivan Mykolaychuk. The script was remade and the movie was filmed in 1972 at the Dovzhenko Film Studios. However, Soviet censors banned it from being screened. Nevertheless, in 1973 the Bureau of Soviet Cinematography Propaganda in Moscow published 50 thousand pamphlets with images of Ivan Mykolaychuk in role of Cossack Vasyl. The movie was finally released after the fall of the Soviet Union. It received the Golden Pagoda Award during the movie festival in Bangkok (see Cinema of Thailand). All the songs in the movie were contributed by Ivan Mykolaychuk, who also helped Ivan Drach write the movie's script.

Based loosely on the Human Target comic book character created by Len Wein and Carmine Infantino for DC Comics, it is the second series based on this title developed for television, the first TV series having been aired in 1992 on ABC. Developed by Jonathan E. Steinberg, Human Target premiered on CTV in Canada and on Fox in the United States in January 2010. The series was officially canceled on May 10, 2011, after the conclusion of the second season.  Synopsis  The series follows the life of San Francisco-based Christopher Chance (Mark Valley), a unique private contractor, bodyguard and security expert hired to protect his clients. Rather than taking on the target's identity himself (as in the comic book version), he protects his clients by completely integrating himself into their lives, to become a \\"human target\\". Chance is accompanied by business partner Winston (Chi McBride) and hired gun Guerrero (Jackie Earle Haley). Former client Ilsa Pucci (Indira Varma) becomes Chance's benefactor, while experienced thief Ames (Janet Montgomery) joins the team to seek redemption. Chance puts himself on the line to find the truth behind the mission. Even his own business partner Winston does not know what drove him towards this life, although it is explained in the first-season finale episode (which also explains about the name Christopher Chance itself).  Cast and characters  From left to right: Guerrero, Ames, Chance, Pucci and Winston. = Main = * Mark Valley as Christopher Chance: An ex-assassin formerly employed by \\"The Old Man\\", who became a security specialist/private contractor/mercenary-for-hire helping those in need. He took the name from the previous Christopher Chance (Lee Majors). His real name is unknown. Abandoned as a child, Chance has a dark and mysterious past, beginning with his recruitment by \\"The Old Man\\" and training into one of the world's greatest assassins. Despite being given the Old Man's true name as his own (he is referred to as \\"Junior\\") and being selected to succeed him as leader of the organization, Chance instead broke ranks, fled, and taking up the name and mantle of Christopher Chance, started his life again. Officially, he is listed as \\"John Doe\\", with the name \\"Christopher Chance\\" amongst his many aliases. * Chi McBride as Detective Laverne Winston: A former police inspector with the San Francisco Police Department who is now Chance's business partner. Winston left the force after the Katherine Walters mission \\"to do what was right. But no B.S.; no egos in the way.\\" At the end of season one, he was in the custody of one of the Old Man's clients for secretly hiding a mysterious book they were after, with Chance and the Old Man working together again to get him back. * Jackie Earle Haley as Guerrero: An ex-assassin formerly employed by the Old Man, who also went rogue alongside Chance after he was ordered to kill Katherine Walters when Chance refused to do it. Guerrero works as part of the team, and despite his complicated nature, cares greatly about Winston and Chance, considering the former a friend and secretly protecting the latter from the Old Man's agents. Outwardly, Guerrero appears weak and nerdy when in reality he is actually a highly intelligent, vicious, and deadly killer. Despite this, he is deeply loyal to his friends and a family man with a child of his own. He helps Chance and Winston in their missions by using his underworld contacts, as an accomplished computer hacker, and is also an expert in torturing people for information. * Indira Varma as Ilsa Pucci: A sophisticated and recently widowed billionaire who becomes a benefactor to Chance to aid their protection agency. * Janet Montgomery as Ames: A thief whose chameleon-like abilities allow her to blend into any situation. Winston, familiar with Ames from his days on the police force, offers her a job in an effort to help her get her life on the right track. = Recurring = * Emmanuelle Vaugier as FBI Special Agent Emma Barnes: After her career was tarnished by Chance's activities in \\"Embassy Row\\", Chance is able to get her help to stop Baptiste's assassination mission in \\"Baptiste\\". With Baptiste's arrest, Barnes' reputation is implied to have been restored. Barnes and Chance have complicated romantic feelings for each other. * Autumn Reeser as Layla: A computer technician who was initially working for a corrupt defense contractor company Sentronics in \\"Lockdown\\", but after it was ruined by Chance, Layla was recruited to freelance for the team in \\"Baptiste\\". * Leonor Varela as Maria Gallego: Chance's former girlfriend who asks for his help in \\"Salvage & Reclamation\\". They are reunited once again in \\"A Problem Like Maria\\" when she asks for his assistance again to rescue a friend of hers. She is also revealed to be married, a secret she keeps from him until they share their goodbyes. * Lennie James as Baptiste: An assassin employed by The Old Man who previously worked with Chance, being his partner, student and friend. Baptiste is one of the world's greatest assassins; amoral, ruthless, incredibly efficient and deadly, but he owes all his skills to being trained by Chance. Baptiste did not take it well when Chance ran away, and even now struggles to understand. Baptiste is responsible for countless deaths, including the flawless hits of heads of state. Most notably, Baptiste killed Katherine Walters and the previous Christopher Chance as seen in \\"Christopher Chance\\". Baptiste's plan to destroy Operation Olive Branch, a secret UN peace summit, was foiled by Chance and Agent Barnes, and so Baptiste was taken into custody by the FBI in \\"Baptiste\\". \\"The Return of Baptiste\\" shows that he was transferred to a Russian gulag. He betrayed Chance after being recruited to assist the team in retrieving hostages taken by Don Miguel Cervantes. Baptiste asks to become Cervantes' head contract killer, before betraying Cervantes to save Chance. On returning from the mission Baptiste vows never to return to the Russian gulag as promised, but he is outsmarted by Chance yet again. He is also shown to collect his victims' watches. * Armand Assante as The Old Man: The leader of an organization of professional mercenaries and assassins, his two favorite subordinates were Chance and Baptiste but, while he respects them both equally, he considered Chance his favorite and, becoming a surrogate father-figure to him, groomed him to be his successor, to the point he gave him his own name as Chance's - and when Chance ran and disappeared, taking the name \\"Christopher Chance\\", it was said to have \\"broken his heart\\". He seeks to re-recruit Chance back into his organization. His reputation for ruthlessness is so great Chance admitted the Old Man was the one person he is afraid of. * Tony Hale as Harry: A private investigator who assists Chance and the team.  Production  On May 18, 2009, Fox announced that Human Target would premiere mid-season. The show was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. On May 12, 2010, it was announced that Human Target had been renewed for a second season. Matt Miller took over as showrunner from Jon E. Steinberg who remained part of the production team as an executive producer. Warner Bros. had contacted Miller to take a look at the first season and give his opinions on what changes he would make to the show. The show was officially canceled on May 10, 2011. = Casting = In the original concept, Jackie Earle Haley's character Guerrero was intended to have a one-time appearance in the pilot episode, and every episode thereafter would feature a different character assisting Chance and Winston. However, the producers liked Haley's performance and his character, and invited the actor to be a regular on the series. = Music = Composer Bear McCreary scored the music for the first season, for which he received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music. He wanted to create a modern classic-adventure score\\", and a heroic but still fun and iconic theme for Chance. Chance's theme later became the opening theme for the first season. McCreary wrote around 30 minutes of full orchestral music for 11 weeks in a row, which was performed by an average of 60 musicians. The score for the final episode of the season, \\"Christopher Chance\\", was performed by a total of 94 musicians, making it the largest live orchestra ever assembled for a television series. McCreary was not asked back for the second season as they could no longer afford a weekly 40-person orchestra. Chuck composer Tim Jones took over the role.  Broadcast  The series premiered in Canada on CTV on January 15, 2010, and began airing on Fox on January 17, 2010. The first three episodes aired in various time slots on Fox; it premiered on Sunday at 8:00 pm ET; the second episode aired Wednesday at 9:00 pm ET; and the third episode aired Tuesday at 9:00 pm ET before relocating to its regular time slot for the remainder of the season, Wednesday at 8:00 pm ET. The first seasons' finale aired April 11, 2010 in Canada and three days later in the U.S. The second season was due to premiere on September 24, 2010 but later delayed to October 1, 2010 airing in a new time slot, Fridays at 8:00 pm ET. Instead of airing the season premiere Fox aired a rerun of Human Target and moved the show back to Wednesdays, taking Lie to Me time-slot, which had moved to Mondays due to the cancellation of Lone Star. The second season premiered November 17, 2010 on Fox and originally aired Wednesdays at 8:00 pm ET. In January 2011, back- to-back episodes aired on January 5 and January 14, 2011. On January 12, 2011, due to network coverage of the Tucson memorial service, the two scheduled episodes did not air in the United States on Fox, however they aired in Canada on A. The episodes were rescheduled and aired on January 14, 2011 on Fox. Fox announced on January 13, 2011, that the next scheduled episode to air on January 26 was to be delayed and aired January 31, airing Monday at 8:00 pm ET. The final two episodes of the season aired on February 2 and 9, airing in another new timeslot, Wednesdays at 9:00 pm. Fox announced the official cancellation of the series on May 10, 2011. In Australia, Human Target premiered on GO! on August 18, 2010. A week later it premiered in New Zealand on TV2. In the UK, it premiered on Syfy on April 14, 2010. The second season was also broadcast on Syfy, and premiered on May 26, 2011. Episodes Season 1 (2010)  Season 2 (2010–11) =Home releases DVD and Blu-ray = Human Target – The Complete 1st Season was released as a widescreen three-disc region 1 DVD box set as well as a two-disc region free Blu-ray version on September 21, 2010. In addition to the 12 episodes of the season, which have an enhanced audio mix, a number of extras are included; several unaired and deleted scenes, an audio commentary by Mark Valley, Chi McBride, Jonathan E. Steinberg and Peter Johnson for the pilot episode and two featurettes; \\"Human Target: Full Contact Television\\" and \\"Human Target: Confidential Informant\\". The set received a rating of 4.5 out of 5 from Blu- ray.com, with concerns expressed that \\"squeezing twelve episodes onto two discs takes a bit of a toll\\" and caused some artifacting. The site also questioned the use of a lossy 640 kbit/s audio track and the small number of special features, calling it \\"a tad pricey for twelve episodes\\". By contrast, DVD Verdict said that the DVD's gave \\"a better-than average offering of supplements\\". = Soundtrack = A two-disc soundtrack containing 43 tracks composed by Bear McCreary for the first season was released by WaterTower Music on October 8, 2010. A limited three-disc soundtrack with an additional 20 tracks was released on October 22, 2010 by La-La Land Records.  Reception  Critical reception = The series premiere of Human Target received generally favorable reviews, scoring 69 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 26 critical reviews. The New York Post stated, \\"because he's a human target, he has no problem blowing out of exploding buildings (of which there are too many to count) with nary a scratch. Think Jack Bauer with excellent grooming.\\" Robert Bianco wrote of the show's premiere in USA Today, the \\"confined-spaces fight on the train is a miniature marvel of its kind.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Cynthia Fuchs gave the show a 3 out of 10, calling it predictable and the characters uninteresting. The second-season premiere received similar favorable reviews, scoring slightly higher than the first season with 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 13 reviews. Brian Lowry from Variety criticized the changes made to the second season believing that the producers were forced to give the show an overhaul by the network to make it more appealing to women. He believes the changes almost ruined the show for those who loved the first season. But he said \\"for all that, there are still some good moments in these early hours, and the stuntwork remains impressive.\\" He was also happy to see the scheduling changes keeping the show away from the Friday night death slot. Some reviewers wondered what happened to the original theme music, with Ian Cullen going as far as to say that \\"the change of music in the opening title sequence just plain sucked.\\" = Viewership = In the U.S. the series premiere attracted 10.12 million viewers, and dropped to 7.24 million viewers for the season finale. The first season averaged on 8.26 million viewers and became 48th in viewers. In Canada the premiere was watched by 1.26 million people, ranking 21st in that week. The second season continued the drop in viewers and premiered to 6.59 million viewers. Viewership increased for the final three episodes of the second season, when the show aired in special time slots. Notably, episode 12 which aired after American Idol, received 9.3 million viewers, a season-high, and the best ratings the series has had since the beginning of the first season. = Awards and nominations = In 2010 Human Target was nominated for three Emmy Awards. Stunt coordinator Dean Choe received a nomination for \\"Outstanding Stunt Coordination\\" for the fifth episode \\"Run\\", Bear McCreary for \\"Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music\\" and Karin Fong, Jeremy O. Cox and Cara McKenney for \\"Outstanding Main Title Design\\".

James Marshall began his engineering career at the Leeds-based Steam Plough Company, and later moved to the city's Boyne Engine Works. Marshall valve gear J. T. Marshall invented and patented several different valve gears but these should not be confused with the \\"Marshall valve gear\\" patented by Marshall, Sons & Co. in 1879. At least one of J. T. Marshall's valve gears was a rotary type and the only known application was to the Austrian BBÖ Class 114 locomotive. The better-known J. T. Marshall gear was a modified Walschaerts valve gear which was first applied to a Great Northern Railway mineral locomotive, no. 743, in 1901 and received a glowing report. Next, it was tried on GNR Class C2 No. 1520 in March 1903. There was no external change visible on the locomotive as a result of this modification. When the valve gear was in use, the motion was derived from two eccentrics, one of which gave lap and lead movement by swinging the link backwards and forwards on its suspension bracket. The other eccentric was set at 90 degrees to the crank and rocked the link by means of a bell crank on the hanging link pin. The position of the radius rod die pin in the link determined the direction of movement and the cutoff. Showing little advantage over the normal Stephenson link valve gear, it was removed from the C2 'Atlantic' in April 1907 to ease maintenance. A modified version of the gear (for outside drive) was tried on SECR N class no. 1850 in 1933-4 but, again, it was not a great success.

Plot The film opens up as a young prosecutor is handed her toughest assignment: a truck driver charged with reckless driving. She has to prove that he was negligent and kept falling asleep at the wheel. After crashing his semi into a sports car, his rig turns over, gas starts leaking out and a fire ensues, shutting down the lights in the long tunnel. Unfortunately, due to the long size of the tunnel, or tube as it is known, it was impossible for rescue personnel to get in the tunnel to give adequate medical attention to the people seriously injured. There are several flashbacks, where survivors recall the accident, including a grieving father named Giuseppe Paoletti, portrayed by Flavio Insinna, an Italian family man who is driving his wife and son to Austria, who emotionally describes his account of what happened after the accident. There are several twists and turns throughout the story. Two versions There are two different versions of the film. Der Todestunnel, the original title, is filmed in German with the Italian actors' voices dubbed, and in the Italian version, 1200º: La Verita della Tunnel della morte the opposite is true. Background The movie is based on a true story about a catastrophic accident, which takes place inside the tunnel connecting Austria and Italy. As a result, at least 50 people died of smoke inhalation.

Facts Benoit and Dassonville claimed that their prosecution for selling Scotch whisky without a certificate was contrary to the TEEC article 30 (now TFEU art 34). A Belgian law said Scotch whisky and other products that had a designation of origin could only be sold if accompanied with a certificate of origin. Competitors had exclusive dealing arrangements with UK exporters, and so they had acquired the whisky from France. However, in France, it was impossible to obtain a certificate because French law did not require certificates. Benoit and Dassonville were accused of forging a certificate and prosecuted. In response, they challenged the legality of the certificate law, based on the rule in article 30 that there should be no quantitative restrictions on trade, or measures of equivalent effect. The Belgian authorities, the Procureur du Roi contended that because the purpose was to protect consumers, not regulate trade, the measure fell outside TEEC article 30. The Belgian court referred the case to the European Court of Justice, as is permitted under TEEC article 234 (now TFEU art 267). Judgment The Court of Justice held that the requirement for a certificate in Belgian law was contrary to article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

During the procedure, a laser is used to finely cauterize ocular blood vessels to attempt to bring about various therapeutic benefits. The procedure is used mostly to close blood vessels in the eye, in certain kinds of diabetic retinopathy; it is no longer used in age-related macular degeneration in favor of anti-VEGF drugs. Medical usesDiabetic retinopathy= The American Academy of Ophthalmology practice guidelines recommend laser coagulation for people who have both mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and clinically significant macular edema outside the fovea; treatment with anti- VEGF drugs is better than laser coagulation for clinically significant macular edema in the fovea. For people with severe NPDR and no macular edema, the AAO recommends laser photocoagulation for the whole retina; when there is macular edema, the laser coagulation focused on major lesions is recommended. As of 2016, while there is preliminary evidence that anti-VEGF drugs may be useful for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, laser coagulation across the whole retina is still preferred in the AAO recommendations, as there is long-term follow up data for laser treatment but not for drug treatment. =Diabetic macular edema= Anti-VEGF drugs are potentially superior to laser coagulation for diabetic macular edema; some specialists are using the drugs over laser coagulation. =Macular degeneration= The American Academy of Ophthalmology practice guidelines do not recommend laser coagulation therapy for macular degeneration, but said that it may be useful in people with new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea who don't respond to treatment with anti- VEGF drugs. Argon, krypton, dye and diode lasers have been used with varying levels of energy have been used to try to prevent age-related macular degeneration by eliminating drusen. A Cochrane review published in 2015 found that while laser treatment reduces drusen, there is no difference from placebo at 2 years with respect to preventing vision loss. A 2007 Cochrane review on found that laser photocoagulation of new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea using blue-green argon, green argon, red krypton, or near- infrared diode is effective and economical method, but that the benefits are limited for vessels next to or below the fovea. =Retinopathy caused by sickle cell disease= Laser coagulation has been used in people with sickle cell retinopathy. A 2015 Cochrane review found two clinical trials conducted in the 1980s using three approaches - one single-center trial employed sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation using an argon laser; and in the second, two-center trial focused on feeder vessel coagulation, one center used an argon laser and the other used a xenon arc laser. Based on weak evidence, it appears that laser coagulation may be effective in preventing visual loss and vitreous haemorrhage in this condition but that it does not have an effect on regression of proliferative sickle retinopathy or preventing the development of new vessel growth. =Radiation proctitis= When radiation therapy is administered to treat cancers like cervical cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer, radiation proctitis can occur, which involved chronic bleeding in the colon. Treatment with Nd:YAG lasers and with Nd:YAG laser passed through a Potassium titanyl phosphate crystal, and with an argon laser has been studied in small clinical trials. Nd:YAG laser has been abandoned due to risks of damaging the colon wall, fibrosis, stricture formation, and recto-vaginal fistula, and severe damage in case of accidents, as well as the cost. The other two modalities were largely replaced by argon plasma coagulation by 2011, which was safer and less expensive.  Complications  In the eye, side effects and complications of laser photocoagulation are not infrequent and include loss of vision, worsening visual acuity, reduced night vision, and hemorrhaging in the eye. In about 8% of cases can cause scarring which in turn can lead to permanent central vision loss. History German ophthalmologist, Gerhard Meyer-Schwickerath is widely credited with developing the predecessor of laser coagulation, photocoagulation. In 1946, he started conducted the first experiments on light coagulation. In 1949, he performed the first successful treatment of a retinal detachment with a light beam (light coagulation) by with a self-constructed device on the roof of the ophthalmic clinic at the University of Hamburg- Eppendorf. Results of using laser coagulation to treat diabetic retinopathy were first published in 1954. Conventional macular focal and grid laser photocoagulation were established as the treatment of choice for diabetic macular edema in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), which published in 1985.

The congregation Dashang Kagyu Vajradhara Ling is focusing on Buddhist prayers and practices. It is structured around a Temple, a stupa, a prayer wheel and a center of spiritual retreat. The prayer wheel contains 100 000 pages on which are printed mantras invocating Dorje Sempa, the Buddha of purification. In 1987, Lama Gyurme initiated the construction of a stupa, which site of construction was consecrated by Kalu Rinpoche and foundations were finished 2 years later. The stupa was dedicated to the memory of the 16th Karmapa. After its construction was completed, the stupa was consecrated by Taï Situ Rinpoche July 15, 1997. In 1999, the congregation received in donation a property situated 60 km away from the center; it is now named Mahamoudra-Ling and transformed in a retreat center for individuals wishing to practice for 6 months, 1 year or more. The congregation also bears the project of constructing a Temple for Peace of a size of 700 m2, a future place for teachings, interfaith dialogue, cultural and scientific events, and will be dedicated to Peace in the world. The cornerstone of the building was laid on September 21, 2003 by Tenga Rinpoche. Today, the Congregation continues to collect the funds necessary for the Temple for Peace construction. In August 2008, during a visit in France, the 14th Dalai Lama came to Vajradhara-Ling in particular to consecrate the place where the Temple will be constructed.Venue de sa sainteté le dalaï-lama .Bouddha dans le bocage normand - Le dalaï-lama dans l'Orne, le jeudi 14 août !

The English language names are listed before the Japanese names. The characters are also referred to in their English-language forms. HamstersHam-Ham Gang= ; :Voiced by: Kurumi Mamiya (Japanese), Chiara Zanni (English) :Owned by Laura, Hamtaro is a courageous Ham-Ham who's always ready to help out his friends and his owner Laura. However, he cannot stand being ignored by Laura. He is clueless about many things being that he is of an innocent nature, especially love (much to Bijou and Sparkle's dismay). Hamtaro makes the most of his life as a golden hamster (8.6cmHamtaro at Hamtaro.com) and lives each day in happiness hoping to make more friends and have fun. Hamtaro usually ends his sentences with \\"noda\\" (のだ) or \\"nanoda\\" (なのだ), a phrase often used by playful characters in the Japanese version. This is omitted in the English version. In both Japanese and English versions, he says such things as \\"Hamha!\\", \\"Heke\\", \\"Packa-packa\\" (\\"kaji-kaji\\"), and \\"kushi-kushi\\". ; :Voiced by: Kazusa Murai (Japanese), Chantal Strand (English) :Owned by Maria. She is a somewhat unworldly hamster who loves her blue ribbons, but she is not above getting dirty when she needs to help her friends, and has been known to be generous and helpful. She used to live in France before moving to where she is now, but she feels attached to Japan and has even refused to go back to France. In the Japanese version, she speaks normal Japanese and adds the words \\"dechuwa\\" (でちゅわ) (most likely a hamster version of \\"desu wa\\") at the end of her sentences, while the English version of Bijou has a French accent. The name \\"Bijou,\\" is French for \\"small, exquisitely wrought trinket\\", or it can also mean \\"jewel\\". She has a huge crush on Hamtaro (this is proven in the first episode, when she winked at him after their dancing performance). ; :Voiced by: Rikako Aikawa (Japanese), Saffron Henderson (English) :Owned by Kana. Oxnard is Hamtaro's best friend in the series and the first Ham-Ham he meets. Oxnard is a bit clumsy at times and has a love for delicious food, especially sunflower seeds (of which he always carries one aroundOxnard at Hamtaro.com). He breaks down in tears when he loses the sunflower seed he carries around. He was originally an easily frightened Ham-Ham, but he has become braver and more dependable in recent episodes. Oxnard has a crush on his close childhood friend Pepper. His Japanese name translates to \\"calf\\", which is probably referring to his spotted cow-like fur and his large appetite. ; :Voiced by: Kentarō Itō (Japanese), Ted Cole (English) :A wild field hamster who wears a helmet and carries a shovel.Boss at Hamtaro.com The self-proclaimed leader of the Ham-Hams, Boss has a huge crush on Bijou. He often tries to look like he knows everything, only to have it backfire in his face. He has a bit of a temper, but he is very dependable, courageous, and nice, even shy at times (especially around Bijou). Because he is a field hamster, he is more familiar with nature and is more independent compared to the other Ham-Hams. He has even developed a field hamster sense that instinctively tells him what kind of weather is approaching. However, he cannot deal with the sea as he is prone to sea sickness. Near the end of Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak, it is hinted that he has a small crush on Harmony. Later in the series, Boss develops a crush on other girl-hams, such as Gelato and Oshare. ; :Voiced by: Rei Sakuma (Japanese), Tabitha St. Germain (English) :Owned by June. Considered to be a very maternal Ham-Ham, as she takes care of Penelope. She loves the color pink and always wears her pink scarf. Dexter and Howdy often fight for her affection, but she does not seem to notice (sometimes acting like a mediator for them). She feels that she is too young for a relationship anyway. Her Japanese name translates to \\"scarf\\", while her English name is based on the word pashmina. ; :Voiced by: Kaori Matoi (Japanese), Jocelyne Loewen (English) :Owned by Kylie. Considered the youngest of all the Ham-Hams, Penelope is usually never seen without the cover of her yellow blanket (though a few seconds in the opening theme show her blanket coming off, revealing her brown and white fur). Although she is friendly to everyone, she feels particularly attached to Pashmina. Being innocent and naive, due to her age, she gets into trouble more often than most of the other Ham-Hams. In season two, she has shown some cross-species affection for Herbert the Pig, a boy by the name of Ethan (Kylie's younger cousin), and a rabbit at Ethan's school. Unlike the other Ham-Hams, and perhaps because of her young age, Penelope can't say anything more than \\"Ukyu\\" (うきゅ) in the Japanese version, and \\"Ookwee\\" or \\"Ookyoo\\" in the English version. ; :Voiced by: Takako Honda (Japanese), Brad Swaile (English) :Owned by the eldest son of a bookstore owner (though it seems that the bookstore owner's daughter is the one who cares for him). He always carries a book with him, and is often turned to for information. He seems to know a lot about science and literature due to his love of reading. He is a little taller than the other Ham-Hams, partially due to his tall ears. He has a crush on Sandy, though it is never initiated until Hamtaro tells him about Sandy's feelings. ; :Voiced by: Haruna Ikezawa (Japanese), Brittney Wilson (English) :Owned by Hillary.

She is also shown to be good friends with Hamtaro, as she confided in him her crush on Maxwell. ; :Voiced by: Kōki Miyata (Japanese), Michael Coleman (English) :Owned by Noel. Sandy's twin brother, who is often caught flirting with the other girl hamsters.Stan at Hamtaro.com As a result, he can be an annoyance to the other boy Ham-Hams, especially Boss, Howdy, and Dexter.

Stan seems to have a crush on Flora, the nurse hamster pet of the veterinarian, Dr. Lion. ; :Voiced by: Yū Sugimoto (Japanese), Paul Dobson (English) :Owned by Goldie. A Ham-Ham notorious for telling bad jokes, especially at inconvenient times. He speaks with a kansai dialect in the Japanese version and with an American Southern accent in the English version.

Coincidentally, his owner is an optometrist. ; :Voiced by: Ai Uchikawa (Japanese), Ellen Kennedy (English) :Owned by Kip and Sue. One of the younger Ham-Hams, Cappy loves hats. The two hats he most commonly wears are his green swimming cap, and the giant red saucepan that he usually hides under. While he loves his home, he does not like being spoiled, and looks up to Boss due to Boss's independence as a field hamster. He has developed some sort of a rivalry with Stucky, especially when it comes to hide and seek. His Japanese name is based on the word \\"kaburu\\" (被る to wear/put something on one's head), while his English name is based on the word \\"cap\\". ; :Voiced by: Yūko Saitō (Japanese), Jillian Michaels (English) :Owned by Mimi.

It received a wide release in France on 16 September 2009 and opened in the United States in 2010. The film deals with the development of the Manouchian Group, a 23-member resistance unit led by an Armenian exile. They were captured in 1944, tried by a German military court, and executed. The title of the film was taken from a propaganda poster known as L'Affiche Rouge (red poster), in which the Nazis sought to present these French Resistance fighters as foreign criminals. The caption read \\"Liberators? Liberation by the army of crime\\". Plot In Paris during the German occupation, resistance movements develop, including some by immigrants. An ill-assorted group of resistance fighters commits disorganized attacks. Missak Manouchian, an Armenian exile, is ready to help but is reluctant to kill; for him, being ready to die but not to kill is an ethical matter. However, circumstances lead him to drop his reluctance. Under his leadership, the 23-member group better strategizes and plans its actions, and develops as what was known as the Manouchian Group. It was part of a network of 100 resistance fighters in Paris that carried out most of the acts of armed resistance in 1943. The film traces the history of this group, from its shaping to the arrest, trial by a German military court, and execution of its members in 1944. Trying to respond to public anger about the executions and discredit the resistance fighters, the Vichy government distributed and put up thousands of posters, known as L'Affiche rouge because of the red background, with photos of ten of the men and data about their backgrounds, in an effort to portray the immigrants as terrorists and criminals. The public wrote Morts pour La France (Died for France) across the posters, the phrase officially commemorating soldiers who die in combat. They also left flowers in tribute.Film documentary on the website of the Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration Cast * Virginie Ledoyen as Mélinée Manouchian * Simon Abkarian as Missak Manouchian * Robinson Stévenin as Marcel Rayman * Jean- Pierre Darroussin as Inspecteur Pujol * Lola Naymark as Monique * Ariane Ascaride as Madame Elek * Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet as Thomas Elek * Yann Trégouët as Le Commissaire David * Ivan Franek as Feri Boczov * Olga Legrand as Olga Bancic * Boris Bergman as Monsieur Rayman * Patrick Bonnel as Monsieur Elek * Adrien Jolivet as Henri Krasucki * Pascal Cervo as Bourlier * Gérard Meylan as Inspecteur Mathelin * Horaţiu Mălăele as Monsieur Dupont * Lucas Belvaux as Gilles ReceptionBox office= Opening in 250 screens, The Army of Crime debuted at number 7 at the French box office, making it the second-highest grossing new release of that week following District 9, which debuted at the number one spot with almost twice as many screens. The film grossed over 772,000 Euros in its first five days of release and attracted 349,940 viewers to French theaters. =Critical response= It was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2009. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 90% based on 30 reviews and an average rating of 6.8/10. At Metacritic, the film has a score of 76 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The film received largely positive reviews from French critics, with the website AlloCiné awarding it a score of 3.52 out of 5.00 based on twenty-five major reviews. Positif's Jean A. Gili praised the film as \\"spectacular\\", while Libération's Didier Péron lamented the fact that the director seemed \\"paralyzed with respect\\" toward his subject, praising the young cast for its efforts in making the film seem fresh. In Paris Match, Alain Spira said the film suffered from classicism and that emotion had trouble reaching the audience. In Première, Véronique Le Bris criticized the time taken to introduce the various characters. In one of the more negative reviews, Pierre Murat wrote for Télérama that while respectful, the film was insignificant and looked like a TV movie. The Army of Crime fared well with international critics, with the website Screenrush awarding it a score of four out of five based on six major British reviews. Peter Brunette of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a positive review after seeing the film at Cannes, saying, \\"Though it drags here and there and is a bit flat in places, the film is solidly made and for the most part quite involving\\". In The Independent, Anthony Quinn described the film as \\"sombre and gripping,\\" while Dave Calhoun wrote in Time Out that the film is \\"always fascinating\\". In some of the worst reviews, The Sun compared the film to Inglourious Basterds, stating that Tarantino's film was \\"a lot more fun,\\" and The Financial Timess Nigel Andrews mused that it felt \\"like every resistance movie you have ever seen\\".

Steinberg is a wall-enclosed vineyard (a Clos, using French terminology) near Hattenheim in the Rheingau.Der Steinbergkeller , accessed on December 29, 20109 Wein-Plus Glossar: Steinberg, accessed on January 24, 2013 It is the largest wall- enclosed vineyard in Germany. Steinberg is one of handful single vineyard sites in Germany which for reasons of historical significance have dispensation from having to include a village name together with the vineyard's name, so the wines from Steinberg are simply labelled Steinberger. The vineyard belongs to the government-owned Hessische Staatsweingüter (Hessian State Wineries) and is today planted with only Riesling vines.  Wines  Vines next to the wall that are used to produce Mauerwein. The Hessian State Wineries produces wines of many different styles from Steinberg, both dry, semi-sweet and sweet Rieslings. The vineyard is classified as an Erste Lage and therefore may be used for the production of dry wines using the Erstes Gewächs designation. Some of the Steinberg grapes are used for small- lot auction wines sold at the biannual wine auctions. In similarity to many other large, wall-enclosed vineyards such as Clos de Vougeot, the entire vineyard is not homogeneous in quality. The slope varies between 15% and 35% inside the wall, which results in differences in sun exposure and drainage. Typically, different parcels (sub-areas) of Steinberg will be used for wines of different types. A parcel named Zehntstück, located in the middle slope, is the source for the best dry wines in most vintages. A row of vines just inside the wall are trained in an espalier fashion directly against the stone wall, and these vines have a markedly different microclimate because of the heat reflected by the stones. The grapes from these vines are harvested separately and are made into small amounts of Mauerwein (\\"wall wine\\"), which typically only are found at the wine auctions.  History  New building of the Hessische Staatsweingüter It was founded around 1170 by Cistercian monks of nearby Eberbach Abbey (Kloster Eberbach). The 2600 meter long wall encircling the vineyard was completed in 1767. The new winemaking facility of the owner Hessische Staatsweingüter was built just outside the wall of Steinberg. It is now the central cellar of the state wineries and was put into operation here in 2008. Since then the Steinberg has become the operating centre of the largest winery in Hesse. The Steinberg Cellar was built from 2006 to 2008 according to the plans of the architect Reinhard Moster from Neustadt an der Weinstraße at a cost of 15,800,000 euros. It occupies a floor space of 64 meters by 83 meters and extends from the level of the courtyard with three floors to 14 meters in depth. The top of the cellar was covered with a two meter thick layer of earth. It has a storage capacity of 1,300,000 bottles and provides 1,800,000 litres of tank space. On half a hectare the vines grow above the cellar. Up to 140.000 kg grapes per day can be processed in the facilities.  The name Steinberg  The name Steinberg is German for \\"stony hill\\" after Stein = stone and Berg = mountain or hill. Although Steinberg is surrounded by a stone wall, the name actually refers to the vineyard's stony soil, rather than to the wall. The name was originally used for only a part of the vineyard, but later became the name of the entire area. The name Steinberg is also used for several other single vineyard sites in Germany. However, for all these other vineyards, the name Steinberg will be used together with a village name, such as Durbacher Steinberg (in Baden) or Niederhäuser Steinberg (in Nahe).

The term Gotham City Sirens refers to three of the most popular female villains inhabiting Gotham City: Catwoman, Harley Quinn, and Poison Ivy. The first issue of the series was released in June 2009, as a part of the Batman: Reborn relaunch of DC's entire line of comic book titles featuring the superhero Batman. PlotSetting= Shortly after the events of the Heart of Hush, Batman R.I.P., Final Crisis, and Battle for the Cowl storylines, Hush cuts out Catwoman's heart, Batman retrieves it, and Zatanna heals her. Catwoman gets her revenge by stealing all of Hush's money and giving it to Gotham City's female criminals, Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, as well as Holly Robinson. Bruce Wayne is thought to be dead and is replaced by Dick Grayson. =\\"Union\\"= When Catwoman fights a new villain named \\"Boneblaster\\", it is revealed she still has physical limitations from her ordeal in \\"Heart of Hush\\" and is nearly easily beaten by the two-bit thug. However, Poison Ivy arrives to save Catwoman and offers her to return to her new hideout, which is actually the hideout of the Riddler, whom Poison Ivy has seduced and drugged. Catwoman discovers Harley Quinn is also living with them, and proposes that the three women join together to protect one another as a team, but first Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy want to know who Batman really is. When Poison Ivy uses a truth serum powder derived from plants, Catwoman reveals that she cannot because Talia, Ra's al Ghul's daughter and leader of the League of Assassins, used mind control techniques to prevent Catwoman from ever forcefully revealing his identity as Bruce Wayne. But Talia taught Catwoman a meditation technique so that any sort of mind-control, such as Ivy's spores, will not affect her. Harley Quinn leaves Poison Ivy's hideout, while Grayson, who is acting as Batman, and the \\"reformed\\" Riddler solve a coinciding case that leads to Quinn encountering Bruce Wayne. Unbeknownst to her, he is actually Hush, who had reconstructed his face to be that of Wayne so he could control Wayne Enterprises. Hush plans to kill Quinn, but when footage of the two together reaches Joker, he decides to kill Harley since he cannot have her. The Joker is revealed to not be himself at all, but an old sidekick of his named Gaggy, who is angered at Harley for replacing him. Poison Ivy and Catwoman manage to save Harley and escape. The three Sirens take separate holidays during Christmas time. After Catwoman fights a gang of \\"knife-wielding Santas\\" who had been attacking people, she joins Dick Grayson and Damian Wayne for Christmas before Damian has the duo leave to catch a murderer. Poison Ivy visits the South American jungles where she pauses her holiday to save a few tourists who stumbled into a drug lord's processing plant. After defeating the drug soldiers, Poison Ivy deduces that she needs to spend time in both the plant and human worlds and returns to Gotham. Harley Quinn visits her dysfunctional family with rocky results. Harley then decides to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where the three women spend the rest of Christmas together. =\\"Songs of the Sirens\\"= Poison Ivy is framed for a series of murders on serial arsonists in Robinson Park. After investigating the murders herself, Poison Ivy is kidnapped by a renegade police officer, who believes her to be the murderer, and left in a hole to die without food, water or sunlight. Catwoman and Harley Quinn work together to save Poison Ivy and find a corrupt cop and the real murderer with James Gordon's help. When they find Poison Ivy's hidden and shrivelled up body without a pulse, Catwoman saves her by tossing her into water, claiming that when your plants seem dead, you water them. With Poison Ivy revived, the Sirens find the real murderer and kill him themselves, making it look like he was just another victim. Catwoman, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn discover a body literally dropped into their lap and previously planted with evidence that it was the Sirens that killed her. Together, the girls enlist the help of the Riddler once again to find the real person trying to frame them, who is actually Doctor Aesop, wanting to take back Catwoman's hideout as his own. Around the same time, wanting to establish herself as something other than a villain, Poison Ivy takes a job at the Gotham City branch of S.T.A.R. Labs, under an assumed identity \\"Paula Irving\\" due to her criminal history. She is soon discovered by one of the scientists who she had fired on her first day, but rather than killing them Ivy instead renews their contract, impressed with the worker's intelligence and deductive skills. Also, Harley Quinn and Catwoman discover Harley's pet hyenas have been escaping at night and hunting and eating local dogs, prompting Catwoman to tell Harley to give the hyenas away to a zoo, which Harley is against. =\\"Sister Zero\\"= While Catwoman is on a private caper trying to discover information on her escaped and mentally unstable sister, Maggie Kyle finds the home of a renowned exorcist looking for help in saving her sister. Incorrectly thinking the exorcist is also in league with Selina's \\"cat demon\\", Maggie kills her and steals her exorcism equipment, discovering a container with a supernatural substance in the guise of an angel. This substance bestows her with supernatural strength and speed and a warped perception of reality. She gets Catwoman, who brings Harley Quinn with her, to meet her and proceeds to attack Harley and Catwoman. During the fight Harley attacks Maggie and calls her \\"Sister Zero\\" as an insult, however Maggie likes this name and uses it. The fight continues until Catwoman can show Maggie she's not possessed, breaking the spell on her momentarily before the \\"angel\\" regains control. However, in that time Maggie decides not to kill Catwoman and leaves. The arc ends with Maggie proclaiming things weren't over and that she now knew she could save her sister through exorcism instead of killing her. =\\"Strange Fruit\\"= Ivy confesses to Ms. Adams, that her main reason why she wants to work in S.T.A.R. labs is that she is looking for a certain chemical that has the ability to grow a forest overnight. In her search, what she encounters is an alien life form which is an intelligent plant, who was captured by the doctor. Seemingly coming under the plant's control and being promised to be its queen, Ivy aids its escape from the lab, battling Catwoman and Harley Quinn on her way to Gotham Park, where the entity plans on spreading her spores in an attempt to take over the planet. When her friends intervene, stopping the plant creature's plan, Ivy turns on him, helping to stop the propagation of his flower bulbs and killing him while telling him that she was used by a man she loves before, and that it will never happen again. Catwoman is abducted by a villain named Senpai for her invaluable information of Batman's real identity, and Ivy and Harley team up with Talia and Zatanna to rescue her. When they defeated the villain, Zatanna and Talia realize that Catwoman is in great risk because of her knowledge, and Talia convinces Zatanna to use her magic to erase it. Talia manages to distract Harley and Ivy as Zatanna scans Selina's memories, but she eventually realizes that Talia only wants to erase Selina's memory of Batman's identity because she cannot bear that another woman whom Batman also loves has this information. Zatanna leaves Selina's memories untouched, then confronts Talia and tells her that she now knows that she set up everything. They briefly fight, but Talia decides she does not want to fight anymore and fires at Selina instead, prompting Zatanna to rescue her. Zatanna asks forgiveness from Selina and still offers her to remove her memories of Batman to ease her burden, but she turns the offer down. =\\"Division\\"= Shortly thereafter all three women feel spurned and neglected by their men of choice, and Harley seeks out Catwoman to console her about her loving Batman, making an equivalence to her feelings for Joker, but Catwoman's discontent stirs anger in Harley, who goes to seek out vengeance on her ex-boyfriend. Harley betrays her two friends and breaks into Arkham with the goal of killing the Joker for abusing her as often as he did. However, Harley ultimately chooses to instead release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates. Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle. Shortly after this, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead pities her and offers to free her if she helps kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham to be captured. Harley and Ivy subsequently escape and try to exact revenge on Selina. A massive fight ensues, which ends with Catwoman revealing that since the group first came together, she had been using her connections with Batman to keep Harley and Ivy from being arrested and that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Harley and Ivy allow Catwoman to go free. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape and the series ends in August 2011 with all three members of the group going their separate ways. Aftermath In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Gotham City Sirens do not exist and are never mentioned as a group - which happens to fit the August 2011 development that all three members of the group went their separate ways. In the new continuity, Catwoman received a new ongoing title written by Judd Winick and drawn by Gotham City Sirens artist Guillem March, Harley Quinn was now a member of the revamped Suicide Squad series, and Poison Ivy is featured in the new Birds of Prey.

The film is being fast-tracked into production, and will be a part of the DC Extended Universe. Margot Robbie will reprise her role as Harley Quinn and will executive produce the film. Suicide Squad director David Ayer will return to direct the film, while Geneva Dworet-Robertson has been hired to write the screenplay. Ayer confirmed the team's lineup as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn, Selina Kyle / Catwoman and Pamela Isley / Poison Ivy, via his social media page. Production was originally reported to begin summer of 2017, but following leadership adjustments in DC Films, the project has been put on hold in favor of another film featuring Harley Quinn, Birds of Prey.http://collider.com/harley-quinn-movie-r-rated-margot-robbie/#images In August 2017, it was confirmed that Jared Leto would reprise his role as The Joker. In 2019, it was announced that Suicide Squad would be followed by a soft-reboot/sequel, with Leto unlikely to return and his other previously announced films as Joker also reportedly shelved. In January 2020, Ayer told /Film that the film is being paused at the moment. =Television= The fourth season of Gotham features its own take on the Sirens, and consists of a younger Selina Kyle, as well as Tabitha Galavan/The Tigress and Barbara Kean (who takes Harley Quinn's role). They are an independent criminal group who attempt to make their own way in the city of Gotham, and end up coming into conflict with Penguin. Halfway through the season, the Sirens gain the allegiance of the League of Assassins' female members. After Selina is shot by Jeremiah Valeska and is told about it by Tabitha, Barbara leads the Sirens into assisting Bruce and Alfred in fighting Jeremiah, Ra's al Ghul, and the League of Assassins members that are on his side. This ends with Barbara forcing Bruce's hand to thrust the embalming knife into Ra's al Ghul as the bombs on the bridge go off. After their masters' death, the male members of the League of Assassins talked it over and wanted to swear their allegiance to Barbara. When Tabitha returns and mentions that Penguin killed Butch Gilzean, Barbara states that men have become a problem for her and has the female League of Assassins members kill the male members and display their bodies outside their female only territory.

It was developed and published by Nuvision Entertainment. Since it was a two-player game, Bimini Run allowed both players to traverse a wide scrolling environment on objective based missions. Story The story begins with the kidnapping of a Kim Ohara, the sister of an expert motorboat driver and secret agent Kenji. The kidnapping is immediately traced to Dr. Orca, who has hired other boat drivers and helicopter pilots to protect his island laboratory/fortress where he plans on unleashing a super weapon on the entire world. Kenji and his partner Luka arm themselves on a power boat and prepare to rescue Kim and save the world. Gameplay The player controls the boat's steering by Kenji and shooting a rapid-fire bazooka by Luka. The gameplay consists of moving around the map (typically, an archipelago), completing objectives and shooting enemies who stand in the way. The player instantly loses a life if hit, so maneuvering to dodge enemy fire and other obstacles is a critical skill to learn. Typical objectives include reaching and destroying certain structures on the islands or following something around the map to their destination. New objectives are received in the form of radio messages notified of by a specific sound effect. In the pause menu, the player can see the last radio message and the map of the area with current targets marked on it.

It held gymkhana equestrian events at various sites around the city. In 1895 it acquired its first permanent home in a rural area east of the city between Kingston Road and the waterfront. In 1898, the Scarboro radial line was extended eastward to the site, and soon the area became a cottage district and then streetcar suburb of Toronto. This forced the equestrian activities to move further afield. In 1907 the horses were thus moved to a site in Thornhill (Steeles' Corner at Steeles Avenue and Yonge Street) called Green Bush Lodge. In 1919 the club moved to a location closer to town at Eglinton Avenue and Avenue Road. Known as the Eglinton Hunt Club, a polo arena, clubhouses and other facilities were erected. The 1930s saw the club run into financial difficulties, however. In 1939, with the outbreak of the Second World War, the large site was purchased by the federal government and turned into a secret Royal Canadian Air Force research facility, the No. 1 Clinical Investigation Unit. Noted scientists Frederick Banting and Wilbur R. Franks were employed there, and it was at the CIU that Franks invented the anti gravity g-suit. The club was also home to RCAF No. 1 Initial Training School, a unit of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. After the war it became the RCAF Staff School, and remained an officer training facility of the Canadian Forces until closed in 1994. By 1995 the Government of Canada transferred the property to the Metropolitan Separate School Board, which was then renamed to the Toronto Catholic District School Board to replace De La Salle College Secondary School, which was re-privatized in 1994 and Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School was built there in 1998.Hurst, Lynda \\"Outrage at sale of city army base Deal \`stinks,' homeowners say\\" - Toronto Star, February 12, 1995.

The original Hunt Club site in Scarborough was turned into a nine-hole golf course in the 1930s, and it remains an exclusive private golfing club today.

HistoryWorld War II= Established as a B-24 Liberator heavy bomb squadron in 1942. Mission was as an Operational Training Unit (OTU) under Second Air Force training B-24 replacement pilots and aircrew. Inactivated in 1944 when B-24 Liberator crew training was ended. =Korean War era= Reactivated in 1952 as an Air Defense Command Fighter-Interceptor squadron during the Korean War. Squadron initially absorbed personnel, aircraft and equipment of several National Guard fighter- interceptor squadrons when they were relieved from active federal service. Provided Air Defense over Eastern Tennessee, specifically over the Atomic Energy Commission Oak Ridge facilities and numerous Aluminum production facilities in the Knoxville area. Converted to F-86s in 1953 and was operationally ready by July 1953. Utilized all major modifications of the F-86, including the \\"L\\" model. Participated in numerous actual and simulated exercises to test alert status and combat readiness until inactivation in 1958. =Vietnam service= Activated again in 1962 as a Tactical Air Command fighter squadron at George AFB, California. Equipped with F-105 Thunderchiefs, but remained unmanned from July 1962 through June 1963. Operational in February 1964, temporarily deployed overseas from November 1964 to March 1965, first to Yokota AB, Japan, to augment the 41st Air Division, and then to Kadena AB, Okinawa, in support of the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing. Reassigned in November 1965 permanently to Thailand, where it prepared for combat fighter operations at Korat RTAFB. Engaged in combat operations over Indochina from November 1965 until inactivated in October 1972, flying F-105s and, after 1968, it flew F-4s. By January 1969, proliferating antiaircraft defenses in the Barrel Roll area in the Kingdom of Laos were making operations ever riskier for Slow FACs such as the Raven FACs. The concept of stationing FACs at the same base with their strike aircraft was bruited. Volunteers from the 469th Tactical Fighter Squadron were approved for Fast FAC duty under the call sign \\"Tiger\\" in February. The inertial guidance systems in their fresh F-4E Phantom IIs would prove consequential for piloting and target location in an environment largely lacking in aerial navigation aids, especially after the 1 March loss of the only TACAN site in northern Laos. On 17 March, the volunteer FACs began supplying the necessary tactical air power for General Vang Pao's Hmong guerrillas to sweep through Operation Raindance. In April, the \\"Tigers\\" were considered for night FAC duties, but rejected. By July, the \\"Tiger\\" FACs were so immersed in directing close air support, they were allotted four sorties per day. Between July and September 1969, the \\"Tigers\\" were credited with 34 enemy killed by air, 12 antiaircraft sites destroyed, 246 interdictory road cuts of enemy supply lines, 15 enemy supply trucks destroyed, 403 structures destroyed, 360 fires caused by explosions, and 681 secondary explosions of munitions and fuel. They accomplished this during 182 FAC missions, during which they directed 2,004 air strikes. In turn, the \\"Tigers\\" suffered five F-4E's severely damaged by enemy fire.Rowley, pp. 193–194Schlight, pp. 26 – 29 =21st century= The 469th Flying Training Squadron was reactivated in April 2009 as part of the 80th Flying Training Wing to conduct undergraduate flying training for EURO-NATO pilot candidates.

Chaffee Park is north of Sunnyside connected via Zuni Street, and northeast of Berkeley connected through Regis via nearby Lowell Boulevard. Chaffee Park is east of Regis and south of Adams County. Chaffee Park earned Sustainable Neighborhood designation from the City and County of Denver in February 2014. Residents are represented by the Chaffee Park Neighborhood Association, which is a Registered Neighborhood Organization (RNO) with the city. There is another Denver city park named Chaffee Park that is located in Sunnyside (south of the Chaffee Park neighborhood). The main park in Chaffee Park is called 51st and Zuni Park, although commonly referred to as Zuni Park. GeographyBoundaries= The neighborhood's boundaries are: * North: 52nd Avenue (including Aria Denver up to Columbine Road) * South: Interstate 70 * East: Railroad tracks along Kalamath Street * West: Federal Boulevard =Zoning= The majority of the neighborhood is zoned as single unit residential properties. The average price per square foot in August 2018 was $340 with an average asking price (for new listings) of $439,633. At the heart of the neighborhood is Zuni Park, which is a zoned open space park. There are several smaller zoned commercial corridors on the western and southeastern edges of the neighborhood, one near the neighborhood center at 49th Avenue and Zuni Street, and a commercial/residential mixed use area in the northwest corner of the neighborhood. There is a zoned area of industrial mixed use and industrial commercial properties on the eastern edge of the neighborhood spanning Osage Street to Kalamath Street. =Transportation= Chaffee Park has access to major roads and highways that connect the Denver metropolitan area, including: Federal Boulevard, Pecos Street and I-70. The neighborhood has nearby access to I-25 via I-70, I-76 via Federal Boulevard and Pecos Street, and US-36 via Federal Boulevard and Pecos Street. Denver's Regional Transportation District (RTD) has three local bus routes serving the Chaffee Park neighborhood: * Route 19: North Pecos * Route 31: Federal Blvd * Route 52: W 52nd Avenue/South Bannock Denver's D-3 Regional Bike Route spans the neighborhood along Zuni Street, from 52nd Avenue south to the adjacent Sunnyside neighborhood, connecting to D-5 at 46th Avenue. A 3.5 mile \\"Wellness Loop\\" pedestrian/bike path connects Chaffee Park with Regis neighborhood to its west, featuring several points of interest, including: Clear Creek Trail, Rocky Mountain Park, and the Sister Gardens at Aria. The Wellness Loop was sponsored by Cultivate Health, The Colorado Health Foundation, WalkDenver and the City of Denver. History In the early 20th century, the area now known as Chaffee Park was a semi-rural area of truck farms interspersed with houses. Chaffee Park was then named after Jerome B. Chaffee, one of the founders of the City of Denver and Republican U.S. Senator from November 1876 to March 1879. In April 1946 the Denver City Council approved the development plan for the Chaffee Park Heights Subdivision submitted by developer Garrett-Bromfield & Co. with initial boundaries between 48th and 52nd Avenues and between Tejon Street and Pecos Street. Chaffee Park was platted over the course of 1945-52, but was mostly completed by 1949. There was so much demand for building supplies in the United States during this period that contractors bartered with other companies around the country for materials during construction. Given the demand for post-war housing, the first 412 homes in the community were only available to U.S. military veterans with children. Numerous residents of the newly developed Chaffee Park neighborhood were second-generation Italian-Americans who were served by the nearby Guardian Angels Catholic Church of Denver that was established in 1953.Goodstein 2017, 88. The homes were built in the Minimal Traditional- style, loosely based on the Tudor Revival-style of the 1920s and 1930s. These one-story homes are typically boxy in appearance with a simple façade, and often feature front facing gable section or gabled cover entries and a low- or intermediate-pitch roof. Overall, this type of development was common in Denver in the Post-War Period. The five-county Denver region experienced a 146% population increase between 1940-1965, from 407,962 residents to over one million. Demographics According to the Piton Foundation, in 2007, the population of the neighborhood was 4,401, and there were 1,554 housing units. In the year 2000, the racial breakdown was 31.44% White, 0.91% African American, 64.13% Hispanic or Latino, 0.91% Native American, and 0.94% Asian. LandmarksZuni Park= Zuni Park is located at the northern edge of Chaffee Park Neighborhood between Zuni Street and Vallejo Street, south of West 52nd Avenue. Zuni Park features: a bike/pedestrian path, multiple picnic areas, a drinking fountain, restrooms, shelter, a basketball court, a playground, mixed-use field space, a baseball/softball field, and an outdoor fitness equipment area (one of The Trust for Public Land's Fitness Zone® program areas). The Fitness Zone was developed as a part of a partnership between nearby Regis University and The Trust for Public Land, who installed the equipment in March 2016 in coordination with Denver Parks and Recreation. Zuni Park is technically unnamed and referred to as 51st & Zuni Park by the Denver Parks and Recreation Department, however it is colloquially known as Zuni Park. =Beach Court Elementary= Beach Court Elementary originally opened in 1921 at West 46th Avenue and Alcott Street utilizing three temporary structures, a fourth was added in 1927 however all four temporary buildings were taken down and replaced with a permanent building in 1929. In its first iteration, the school featured three bungalows and one kindergarten room serving approximately 100 students.Goodstein 2017, p. 497 Rapid enrollment at the school led to the design and construction of a new building at West 46th Avenue and Beach Court in 1929-30, designed by architect G. Meredith Musick, with six classrooms and one kindergarten. The neighborhood experienced continued growth and Musick oversaw an addition to the school in 1949-51, dedicated on May 21, 1951. At the time of the addition, approximately 600 students attended Beach Court Elementary. In 1951 the school grew to seven classrooms and two kindergarten rooms. Additional facilities were added, including the: library, gymnasium, kitchen, clinic, conference room, office, and teacher's lounge. Educational programming expanded to include audio-visual aids, health programs, film and movie equipment, a band, and orchestra lessons. The school also functioned as a community center, used by organizations like the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and the Red Cross, for sewing, first aid, nutrition, and other classes. The school grew to twenty-two classrooms in 1993, with an addition designed by architecture firm JH/P Architecture and built by Ward Construction. The school also moved to a student-centered environment with the State of Colorado's student performance standards.Learning Landscapes 2008, p. 6 In October 2016 Beach Court Elementary was among the first Denver Public Schools (DPS) to receive a SmartLab, after a competitive application process. This addition to the schools' educational offerings was made possible by a donation from DPS alumni Marco Campus, with the remaining half of matching funds coming from DPS and the DPS Foundation. SmartLabs offer project-based, student-centered curriculum supporting STEM and other core academic content. SmartLabs are a part of DPS CareerConnect's STEMConnect partnership with DPS Curriculum and Instruction with the aim of getting students interested in STEM careers at an early age. Beach Court Elementary's school colors are blue and white and their mascot is the eagle.Learning Landscapes 2008, p. 6 =Chaffee Park Shopping Center= The Chaffee Park Shopping Center, located near West 48th Avenue and Pecos Street, opened in 1947-1949. The development was led by real estate firm Garrett-Bromfield & Co. and originally featured middle-class retail outlets such as a Safeway grocery store and a J.C. Penney department store. Developers were confident that residential real estate construction for veterans returning from World War II would fill in the housing blocks adjacent to the complex, which happened shortly thereafter.Goodstein 2017, p. 88 =Zuni Plaza= Zuni Plaza is an upcoming development in the heart of Chaffee Park (49th Avenue and Zuni Street) at a vacant church originally built in 1952. The project is converting the building and parking area into a commercial space for retail, restaurants, and a dedicated artist studio within the former church building. While Chaffee Park grew after the city's streetcar system connecting north Denver was dismantled, Zuni Plaza will serve as an extension of the revitalized former streetcar commercial nodes spanning north Denver along Zuni Street (which connects the Chaffee Park, Sunnyside, Highland, and Jefferson Park neighborhoods). The Zuni Plaza project is led by Denver-based developers Columbia Group and Paul Tamburello (founder of Little Man Ice Cream in LoHi and dubbed the \\"father of the rejuvenated Highland\\" by The Denver Post.) Skyline Festival Chaffee Park's annual Skyline Festival in Zuni Park is a community event featuring: exercise, games, food trucks, pot luck food share, children's activities, booths from local community organizations and vendors, and live music. Founded in 2017 by residents of the community, the Skyline Festival is one of many events associated with the city of Denver's Denver Days program.

He was the author of Two of the Missing, about fellow journalists Sean Flynn and Dana Stone, who went missing during the Vietnam War and whose fates remain unknown, and the co- author of The David Kopay Story, a biography of 1970's professional football player David Kopay, who revealed in 1975 that he was gay. Early life Young was born on March 27, 1941 in Woodfin, North Carolina, near Asheville, the youngest of 13 children. His mother was Rheba Maphry Tipton Young. His father, Robert, died in 1958. He edited his high school newspaper and earned a scholarship to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1959. He graduated in 1994. Career Dropping out of UNC, Young worked for several newspapers, including the Durham Morning Herald, the Raleigh News & Observer and the Chapel Hill Weekly. In 1963, he covered the N.C. General Assembly for UPI. He also worked as part of Richardson Preyer's unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign in 1964, and joined the Army Reserves in 1966. He then went to work for United Press International in 1967. Young took an assignment with UPI in Vietnam, arriving in Saigon on January 29, 1968, and his first story was about the Tet Offensive, which began later that night. While covering the war, he roomed with fellow journalists Tim Page, Sean Flynn, and Nik Wheeler. He left after witnessing the near-fatal injuries to Page. In 1975, his book Two of the Missing was published. The memoir was based on a magazine article of the same name that Young wrote in Harper's Magazine in December 1972, with the intention of later writing a book about the disappearance of Flynn and Stone. He had met and worked with them in Vietnam covering the war, and they went missing after Young had left. After reading of the American football player Dave Kopay's post-retirement revelation of being gay, Young offered to help Kopay write a book. The offer was accepted, and in 1977, the book appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list. For a time, Young and Kopay lived together in Washington, D.C. A Killing Cure, about Evelyn Walker's malpractice suit against psychiatrist Zane Parzen, was published in 1982. In a 1998 profile, Young revealed that \\"[the] book made no money at all, and it was a disaster.\\" He was a columnist for The Chapel Hill Herald from 1996–2003. In addition to the books, Young penned three plays with William Gregg. All three were produced by the Southern Appalachian Repertory Theatre: Frankie in 2001; Mountain of Hope in 2004; Home Again, 2009. Personal Young long acknowledged that he was gay, writing candidly about it in Two of the Missing, and authored or co-authored books with gay-related themes, including The David Kopay Story and Lesbians and Gays and Sports. He lived in the basement of a non-profit counseling and support group in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, working around the building in lieu of rent, from 1993 until his death. Young died from cancer on January 1, 2019, aged 77.

The word radiogram is a portmanteau of radio and gramophone. The corresponding term in American English is console. Radiograms reached their peak of popularity in the post-war era, supported by a rapidly growing interest in records. Originally they were made of polished wood to blend with the furniture of the 1930s, with many styled by the leading designers of the day. An expensive instrument of entertainment for the house, fitted with a larger loudspeaker than the domestic radio, the radiogram soon began to develop features such as the record autochanger, which would accept six or seven records and play them one after another. Certain recordings could be ordered as a box set which would combine the recorded piece in order, to suit an autochanger set-up. In the 1940s and 1950s, sales of the radiogram, coupled with the then-new F.M. waveband, and the advent of the 45 rpm single and the LP record, meant that many manufacturers considered the radiogram to be more important than the fledgling television set sales. Later models took on the modern lines, piano gloss finish and plastic and gilt trim of the 1960s. Stereogram versions became available to take advantage of stereo records. As valve radio development ended in the late 1960s and transistors began to take over, radiograms started to become obsolete. By the late 1970s, they had been replaced by more compact equipment, such as the hi-fi and the music centre. Since radiograms were manufactured in such huge numbers they are not as rare or valuable as TV sets or table radios from the same period. An exception to this are models from certain manufacturers which have become collectable such as Hacker Radio Ltd., Dynatron, Blaupunkt, Braun, and SABA.

The plantation is a wedge-shaped property between the Harrietta Plantation and the Fairfield Plantation. The plantation house was built around 1830. It is located off US Highway 17 near the Santee River. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on September 18, 1975. History The house was built by a rice planter William Lucas around 1826. Lucas was a son of Jonathan Lucas, who invented a rice-pounding mill. It remained in the Lucas family for the next hundred years. It was a working rice plantation up to about 1914. In 1929, Mr. and Mrs. Elbridge Chadwick acquired the plantation and restored the house with the assistance of architect Albert Simons. In 1948, Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Woodward purchased it for a winter home. Dr. and Mrs. Richard B. Dominick owned the Wedge Plantation from 1966 to 1976. During the ten-years of his life there, Dominick collected over 25,000 moths and 1,000 butterflies on the plantation. The Richard B. Dominick Moth and Butterfly Collection resides at the University of South Carolina's McKissick Museum in Columbia, South Carolina. Richard Dominick established the Wedge Entomological Research Foundation for the publication of the Moths of North America North of Mexico.Richard Dominick died at The Wedge in May, 1976. His estate owned the property for another six years. In the 1970s, The Wedge was purchased by the State of South Carolina for \\"about $1 million.\\" It became the University of South Carolina's International Center for Public Health Research for the study of insect-borne diseases. This program was closed in 1995 when funding for it expired and was not renewed. The University then leased The Wedge until 2014 for hunting and other uses, including the 2009 Kevin Costner film The New Daughter . Attempts to sell the plantation have failed. The university's board of trustees determined that the annual cost of maintaining the plantation at $385,000 in 2013, but the university allots only $100,000 yearly as of 2020. In 2014, the plantation was put up for sale at $4 million, but no offers were made. A subsequent attempt to find a buyer using a real estate agent also failed. An appraisal of the plantation's value included $500,000 in needed repairs. On July 3, 2020, the university opened the bidding process again with the minimum bid pegged at $3.2 million, with bids due by August 20, 2020. Architecture The house was constructed around 1826. This is a Federal style, clapboard house on a raised basement. The basic shape of this -story house is rectangular. The house has a gable roof with dormers. The front horseshoe stairs to the porch are granite with an iron railing. A semicircular archway leads to the basement. The portico is supported by four fluted Doric columns. The pediment has a semi-elliptical window. It is decorated with dentate molding. The second floor has French doors with a fanlight transom that open to the railed balcony on the portico. The south facade has single nine over nine lights on either side of the doors. Each wing has four nine over nine lights. In the second story, there are pairs of six over six lights to the left and right of the porch gable. The front door has a fanlight transom. Dormer windows and basement windows are six over six lights. The gabled ends have three six over six lights. The east and west elevations have four nine over nine lights. The north elevation has two dormers. There are four windows on each floor and a window in the stairwell between the first and second floors. The rear portico has four Doric columns. The interior has a four-room, central hall plan. The main floor has right and left parlors separated by the central hall. Behind are an alcove and library on the right and a kitchen and laundry on the left. The basement includes a wine cellar, storage room. The basement floor is brick.

In 1961 Hendricks published The Edison Motion Picture Myth in which he showed that it was not Thomas Alva Edison who should be attributed with the invention of the first device for cinema screenings, but in fact William Kennedy Laurie Dickson. The publication of Beginnings of the Biograph followed shortly after in 1964. In 1966, Hendricks published, The Kinetoscope. These books became milestones in the writing of film history. Hendricks was the first motion picture specialist to lecture in the Sunday series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was the first to show motion pictures in the Great Hall at Cooper Union. In 1975 he authored a work, republished in 2001, about Eadweard Muybridge, in which he called Muybridge the father of the cinema. Hendricks then began a series on books on painters and photographers. He published works about Winslow Homer and Albert Bierstadt. He also published The Photographs of Thomas Eakins. He has 16 volumes of his writings in the Library of Congress. At the time of his death, Hendricks was engaged in writing a book about the art of Thomas Cole. After his death Hendricks bequeathed two major collections to the Archives of American Art: one about Thomas Eakins, the other about film history.  Works  * The Edison Motion Picture Myth.

New items are regularly added to ensure high quality resources are available for learning, teaching and research. The library provides access to over 600 databases; 500,000 e-books; more than 69,000 electronic journals; books, printed resources and multimedia via MultiSearch.  The New Library  The new Library building was opened on 25 July 2011, and was assigned building number C3C. It provides a 21st-century learning and research environment that facilitates vital interactions between people and knowledge. The new Library has over 2500 seats for group and individual study and more than 200 PCs for students. The library also provides study seats with desktop power for laptops, Macquarie network access, vending machines and has dedicated Postgraduates and Higher Degree Research study spaces with free lockers for Macquarie University Students. The native park lands of the campus have inspired an innovative design, which aims to set impressive sustainability standards such as: * A green roof with grass and gardens * Natural light wells for lower floors * External shade fins * Zoned lighting * Use of recycled material in construction * An Automated Storage and Retrieval System  Automated Storage and Retrieval System  Macquarie University Library was the first University in Australia to install an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) in its Library. The ASRS consists of an environmentally controlled vault with metal bins storing the items. Robotic cranes retrieve an item on request and deliver the item to the service desk for collection. The retrieval process takes just a few minutes and helps increase the use of the print collection by making access more convenient. This innovative technology was adapted from the automotive industry's application for warehousing and retrieving small components. It allows higher density storage resulting in a significantly smaller footprint and a more affordable project cost. Around 80% of the physical collection is stored in the ASRS and 20% on open access shelves.  Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie Room  Another special feature in the Library is the Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie Room, which provides a unique historical link between Macquarie University and its namesake, Lachlan Macquarie, the fifth British governor of New South Wales. The Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie Room is showcased inside the entrance to the Library. The Room is of the original ground floor parlour room from Lachlan and Elizabeth Macquarie's home on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. It includes all the original timber panelling, doors, windows, alcoves, shutters, and fireplace dating from the 1820s.

He was educated at The Ravenscroft School and attended the after-school drama club at the Anna Scher Theatre School, where he met friend and future co-host Reggie Yates. Dev's Twitter profile picture is him playing a guitar with Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney. CareerEarly career= Dev began his radio career in 2000, aged 16 on pirate station Freek FM, specialising in garage and jungle. Here he was known as DJ Devstar and presented with Yates (who used the moniker MC Nobizzi). In 2002, whilst studying for his A Levels at The Ravenscroft School, Griffin landed a job co-presenting the children's interactive TV show Smile (credited as DJ Devstar) alongside Yates, Fearne Cotton and Nev the Bear. Six months into filming, he was approached by BBC Radio 1Xtra to present a Saturday afternoon show with Yates. In 2003, Dev left Smile to concentrate on his radio career. =Acting= In 2006, Dev created and starred in children's sitcom The Crust. He has starred as himself in Friday Download: The Movie, as a result of campaigning at length on air to get himself a role in a B movie. =DJ= Dev was a member of the Rebellious music collective and played in venues at Ayia Napa and Faliraki. He opened for Kanye West at the Hammersmith Apollo and Jurassic 5 at the London Astoria. He also played at the Radio 1 Teen Awards. =Radio= Dev joined BBC Radio 1Xtra at the launch in August 2002, where he and Yates presented The Lowdown with Reg and Dev on Saturday afternoons. In August 2004, the show moved to Saturday mornings, with Dev additionally doing the show by himself on Sunday mornings. Yates left 1Xtra in December 2004, leaving Dev to present both Saturday and Sunday morning shows by himself. Following further schedule changes in September 2005, Dev moved to Saturday afternoons where he stayed until 2007, when he became presenter of the weekday early morning show. In July 2009, he moved to BBC Radio 1 to take on the weekend breakfast show. In September, he moved from the weekend slot to replace Greg James as host of the weekday early breakfast show, between 4am and 6:30am. In March 2014, he left the weekday slot and returned to the weekend breakfast show, taking over from Gemma Cairney. He has regularly presented The Radio 1 Breakfast Show (sitting in for Nick Grimshaw), the Scott Mills show and the Greg James show as a relief presenter. In 2018, he and Alice Levine began hosting their own show, Dev & Alice, in the weekend breakfast slot. The duo were moved to the weekend afternoon show the same year. On 9 August 2020 the final show aired, following the announcement of Levine's departure from Radio 1. =Television= Dev reached the final of the 2017 series of Celebrity Masterchef, alongside Ulrika Jonsson and eventual winner, Angellica Bell. Dev participated in the 17th series of Strictly Come Dancing, partnered with professional dancer Dianne Buswell. They became the third Strictly couple to leave the show after losing a dance-off to Emma Weymouth and Aljaž Skorjanec. In April 2019, Dev took part on a celebrity special of SAS: Who Dares Wins.

The original themes were: Metal Monday, Trance Tuesday, One Hit Wonder Wednesday, First Bought Thursday and Freedom Friday. They were later changed to: Mosh-Pit Monday, Cheesy Tuesday, Work-Out Wednesday, Zombie Apocalypse Thursday and Film Friday. *First Text of the Day Just after 4am Dev reads out the first texts received to Radio 1's text number during his show, and rewards the first by calling them back and sending them a \\"First Text Certificate\\". Usually, the first text would come in at exactly 4:00:00am. He would also mention the First Tweet of the Day. * Fish Fact or Fish Fiction a game based on fish trivia. * Name That Tune Dev learned a current song on the piano in preparation for his Radio 3 performance and listeners had to guess what song it was. * Decode the Load Dev must guess what cargo a lorry driver is carrying in his/her (usually his) lorry. * Dyer Watch this consists of Dev playing out clips of Danny Dyer from EastEnders appearances. * Lucky Last Night listeners text in to let Dev know whether anything lucky happened to them last night, and what they would rate the lucky experience out of 10. * Super Good Friday listeners would phone in on a Friday to tell Dev that they're feeling \\"GOOD, GOOD, SUPERGOOD!\\" over a German electro-dance track (Super Gut by Mo-do). * Super Bad Girls also on a Friday. Dev (conscious of restoring the male-female balance of the show) would invite his \\"Super bad girls\\" (men with female versions of male names doing women's voices) to call in, and tell him how they feel (bad, bad, superbad!), to the music of \\"Superbad\\" by Flux Pavilion and Doctor P. * The Bass Cannon After playing songs considered particularly downbeat for the time of day, Dev would offer \\"a few squirts of the Bass Cannon\\" by means of compensation, to restore the balance. The Bass Cannon is the song by Flux Pavilion, championed on BBC Radio 1Xtra by MistaJam. This has been used once so far on the Weekend Breakfast Show. =Weekend Breakfast= \\"First Text of the Day\\" continued on the Weekend Breakfast Show until late 2016, and new features were introduced: * Sports Stars Dev speaks to a listener taking part in a sporting competition on Saturday's show, and sets them a target to achieve. They are called back on Sunday's show to find out how they did, and if they achieved their target, they can choose any song to be played on Radio 1. If they failed to achieve their target, Dev plays them an extract from \\"In the End\\" by Linkin Park (\\"I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter\\"). This feature ended in 2015. * Whosbeat a short lived feature involving Radio 1 DJs humming a tune and inviting listeners to guess what it is. Whosbeat was dropped after the move to the 6am start. * Rihanna's Bargain Bin Review Radio 1 film critic (known as \\"buff movie buff\\" to Dev) Rhianna Dhillon reviews a B Movie found in the bargain bin of a supermarket, usually slating it and getting frustrated. This feature ended when Dhillon left Radio 1. * Blagger's Guide to the World Cup During the 2014 World Cup, Dev would get Dan Walker of BBC Football Focus to teach him useful quotes about the World Cup Matches that he could use to blag his way through football related conversations. This led to Dev being invited to take part in the Match of the Day Fantasy Football League. * Dev's Massive Topic on Saturday's show, in an attempt to be more highbrow (like Radio 4), Dev puts a subject up for debate. Previous massive topics have included: left or right, sponge or puff, and tea or coffee. This has since been renamed to \\"Which is Best\\". * Stags vs Hens On Sunday's show, Dev gets a member of stag and hen parties on the phone, to compete against each other in a stag and hen based quiz. The first edition of Stags vs Hens was played on Sunday 5 September 2014, and the final edition on Sunday 4 January 2015. The feature was discontinued because Dev ran out of stag and hen based questions. * Mini Manager Dev was invited to take part in the Match of the Day Fantasy Football League following the 2014 World Cup. However, knowing nothing about football, he enlists the help of a Mini Manager, typically a child of around 10 years old, to instruct him what changes to make to his team for the following week. This happens on Saturday's show. Dev has enjoyed reasonable success in the Fantasy Football League, as a result of his help, at one point being third in the table, and beating Match of the Day 2 presenter Mark Chapman * The Best Friend Test A listener prank calls their best friend, making some strange, difficult or outrageous demand and sees if their best friend will agree to it, testing how much of a good best friend they are. It mainly features on Dev's daytime cover shows, but has appeared on the Weekend Breakfast show on occasion. * Heads or Tails A caller phones in to guess whether a coin Dev tosses will land on heads or tails. This takes place after 6am on both Saturday and Sunday. * My Weekend Sounds A caller describes an activity they have partaken in during the weekend only in sound effects and Dev must guess what the activity is. This takes place after 9am on Saturday and Sunday. * The 7am Pen Game A caller must direct Dev by telling him to move up, down, left and right in five moves, after which Dev throws a pen to try and land it in a receptacle held in a random part of the studio by the Producer. This has been discontinued. * Request Roulette Dev has a roulette wheel with four spaces, on which four songs are placed. One of them is a listener's request; the other three are usually themed. Dev plays whichever song the ball lands on when the roulette wheel is spun. The caller has the option to decide whether the wheel is spun clockwise or anticlockwise, and after one spin, the caller is given the opportunity to go 'double balls' and spin again, without knowing what it landed on originally. This is played after 7am on Saturday and Sunday. * Review Taboo Radio 1's Film Critic Ali Plumb comes to deliver a review of a film currently in the cinema. However, Dev complies a list of ten banned words or phrases that Plumb is not allowed to include in the review, without Ali knowing what they are. If and when Plumb says one of the banned words or phrases, he is buzzed by Dev, much to his frustration and Dev's amusement. This occurs after 8:30am on a Saturday.

Historically, they were known for their lip plates, an unusual form of body modification which they practiced. After marriage, Suyá men used to have their lower lip pierced, and have a small wooden disk placed inside. The size of the disk would be gradually increased as time went on, permanently changing the size of the lip. Like many other tribes in the upper Xingu, the Suyá have been devastated by diseases introduced by European explorers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After the establishment of the Xingu Indigenous Park in the 1960s, and after the introduction of organised medical care into the area, the population of the Suyá grew greatly. Their population has increased from 123 in 1970, to 330 in 2010.http://www.scielo.br/pdf/csp/v23n5/09.pdf  Language  The kisêdjê language is of the jê family. Cultural History There are not many archaeological or ethnographic records extending back before 1884 because little cultural material can be preserved in the humid tropics, and most materials used were organic. However, the ethnographic evidence that does exist claims that the Suyá music people made a long journey from a territory more than 1,100 kilometers to the northeast, fleeing and fighting enemies.Suyá ( Main Record ) By: Seeger, Anthony. Collected Work: The Garland encyclopedia of world music. II: South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Published in: United States. Publication Date: 1998 . Language: English. Abstract available. (AN: 1999-22922) They migrated to the Xingu region around 1840, where they met with a number of groups with whom they obtained women, children, and exchanged items. Although many of these tribes spoke different languages they shared a similar culture, and the region where they settled is often referred to today as the \\"Upper Xingu Culture Area.\\" From the Xingu they adopted many aspects of their culture such as; canoes, hammocks, and ceremonies.\\"Suya - History and Cultural Relations.\\" Countries and Their Cultures. Web. http://www.everyculture.com/South-America/Suya-History-and- Cultural-Relations.html They also adapted food preparation techniques, such as believing that all food must be cooked before eaten. Body ornamentation was also an aspect of their culture that they took on. Body ornaments are significant markers of age and status.Suyá ( Main Record ) By: Seeger, Anthony. Collected Work: The Garland encyclopedia of world music. II: South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Published in: United States. Publication Date: 1998 . Language: English. Abstract available. (AN: 1999-22922) The Suyá community has always believed greatly in the collective good. They share everything from fire, food, land, songs, performances, shelter, clothes, and children. A child is raised by the whole community not just by their biological parents, although they know who their biological parents are they do not identify with them as a westernized person would, with a sense of ownership, to a Suyá person the entire community is their family.Bohlman, Philip V. Ethnomusicology and Modern Music History. Ed. Stephen Blum and Daniel M. Neuman. Illinois: Board of Trustees of The University of Illinois, 1993. Print. Their names also have much more importance than people from the western world attribute to names as well. They believe that names are central to the definition of who a person is and the groups to which he or she belongs; therefore, they pick their names very carefully. Today the Suyá live in a single village of about two hundred inhabitants on the banks of the Suiá-Miçu River. They speak a language belonging the northern branch of the Gê language family. They hunt, fish, gather supplies, and trade with frontier settlements to get their basic needs.Suyá ( Main Record ) By: Seeger, Anthony. Collected Work: The Garland encyclopedia of world music.

While it only reached as high as number sixty-one on the Billboard Hot-Selling Soul Singles chart upon its initial release, it has gone on to become one of the singer's signature anthems. OverviewBackground= Patti LaBelle ended an eighteen-year association with Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash as their group Labelle had decided to break up. LaBelle reluctantly carried on with a solo career with the support of then-husband Armstead Edwards, who signed on as her personal manager. In the middle of recording her debut album in New Orleans with Chameleon producer David Rubinson, Labelle and Edwards wrote lyrics to a James \\"Budd\\" Ellison composition they called \\"You Are My Friend\\". The song was a tribute to the couple's only child, Zuri Edwards. The song was one of the last to be recorded for LaBelle's debut self-titled solo album. =Background and composition= \\"You Are My Friend\\" was musically composed by James Ellison, otherwise known as \\"Budd\\". Ellison was a longtime background musician for Labelle and had befriended the singer following Labelle's split. Prior to recording the song, Ellison and another Labelle musician, Edward Batts, co-wrote the song, \\"What Can I Do For You\\", for Labelle's 1974 album, Nightbirds, which became a modest hit. The lyrics were by Edwards and LaBelle themselves. Edwards and LaBelle wrote on previous Labelle albums together. The majority of the song was recorded under E major. Rubinson, who produced the song, included rhythm guitar, bass, drums and strings. Ellison played piano on the song and some of the background vocals were handled by The Waters and members of The Valentinos (Bobby Womack's former family group). One of its members, Cecil Womack, would later collaborate with LaBelle on her material with Philadelphia International Records in the early eighties. While the majority of the song was arranged as a pop ballad, gospel elements were included. This inclusion wouldn't be noticed until LaBelle's live performances of the song, which she and Ellison arranged. =Reception= Released in early 1978 as the second single from Patti LaBelle, the song was a relative failure on the R&B; chart only peaking as high as number 61 and failing to even enter the Billboard Hot 100. The success of the song in its early years was due to LaBelle's live performances of the song. When she first performed the song in her first solo concert in London, LaBelle received a standing ovation, she received a similar one when she performed the song on TV the first time on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert as the last song she performed before leaving the stage. The song received radio airplay on urban radio stations, which still continues today, and is regarded as one of LaBelle's signature songs. =Covers= One of the covers of the song was from singer Sylvester, recorded in San Francisco for his live album Living Proof. During the song, Sylvester was joined by The Weather Girls, who started off as Sylvester's backup singers, Two Tons Of Fun. While he dedicated the song to LaBelle, it was clear that it was a love about him and The Weather Girls. That same year, disco group Kenny & Friends did a dance version of the song. In 2003 gospel singer Shirley Caesar recorded the song for her album Shirley Caesar & Friends which featured Patti LaBelle on the recording. Faith Evans did a live version paying tribute to LaBelle in 2001. LaBelle re- recorded the song for her album The Gospel According to Patti LaBelle, in 2006, as a tribute to her deceased collaborator, James Ellison.

Typically, this stimulation test involves determining basal TSH levels and levels 15 to 30 minutes after an intravenous bolus of TRH. Normally, TSH would rise into the concentration range measurable with less sensitive TSH assays. Third generation TSH assays do not have this limitation and thus TRH stimulation is generally not required when third generation TSH assays are used to assess degree of suppression. Differential diagnosis use TRH-stimulation testing however continues to be useful for the differential diagnosis of secondary (pituitary disorder) and tertiary (hypothalamic disorder) hypothyroidism. Patients with these conditions appear to have physiologically inactive TSH in their circulation that is recognized by TSH assays to a degree such that they may yield misleading, \\"euthyroid\\" TSH results.Use and Interpretation: • Helpful in diagnosis in patients with confusing TFTs. In primary hyperthyroidism TSH are low and TRH administration induces little or no change in TSH levels • In hypothyroidism due to end organ failure, administration of TRH produces a prompt increase in TSH • In hypothyroidism due to pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism)administration of TRH does not produce an increase in TSH • In hypothyroidism due to hypothalamic disease (tertiary hypothyroidism), administration of TRH produces a delayed (60–120 minutes, rather than 15–30 minutes) increase in TSH Process and interpretation The TRH test involves administration of a small amount of TRH intravenously, following which levels of TSH will be measured at several subsequent time points using samples of blood taken from a peripheral vein. The test is used in the differential diagnosis of secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism. First, blood is drawn and a baseline TSH level is measured. Then, TRH is administered via a vein. After 30 minutes blood is drawn again and the levels of TSH are measured and compared to the baseline. Some authors recommend additional blood sampling at 15 minutes. In children, late blood sampling at 60 to 120 minutes is necessary. An increase in the serum TSH level following TRH administration means that the cause of the hypothyroidism is in the hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism), i.e. the hypothalamus is not producing TRH. Therefore, when TRH is given exogenously, TSH levels increase.If the increase in serum TSH level following TRH administration is absent or very slight, then the cause of the hypothyroidism is in the anterior pituitary gland, i.e. the pituitary is not secreting TSH. Therefore, even when TRH is given exogenously, TSH levels do not rise as the pituitary is diseased. Side effects and risks TRH may cause nausea, vomiting and some patients experience an urge to urinate. Rarely, TRH may cause blood vessel constriction leading to hemorrhage in patients with pre-existing pituitary tumors. Accordingly, patients should be advised about the risks, albeit rare, of TRH testing.

He now writes and performs music with his wife Melody Part. Biography Part first developed an interest in acting at the age of five. Right before Part's father died, he made his wife promise that their son could become an actor. Part told his dad that he would make his name famous. Part's first acting job was in an episode of Lucas Tanner called \\"Collision\\" in 1975. Later that year, he was in an episode of ABC Afterschool Special and also made a guest appearance on The Waltons. From 1975 to 1977, Part acted in twenty-one episodes of Little House on the Prairie as Carl Sanderson Edwards, the first of which was \\"Remember Me - Part 1\\". In the episode, Julia Sanderson (Patricia Neal), a widow with three children (of which Part was the middle), learns that she is going to die and needs to find a home for her children. In the continuation of the episode, Part and his television siblings, Radames Pera and Kyle Richards, are adopted by the recently married Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, played by Victor French and Bonnie Bartlett. In 1976, Part played Samuel in Birch Interval. After Little House he was in Return from Witch Mountain in 1978 and an episode of Project UFO in 1979. During the early 1980s, Part guest starred on such shows as Eight Is Enough and Knots Landing as well as appearing in Max Dugan Returns in 1983. Part also landed commercials for Dawn dishwashing liquid and Shasta Cola. His stage work includes Desperate Hours alongside Anthony Caruso and a lead part in the musical Forrest Lights with his wife Kathryn E. Part. Retiring from acting in 1983, he has now turned his career towards music, performing with bands such as Warrant and Vixon, as well as musicians Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart. With his wife, Melody Part, Brian has recorded CDs. Part describes his Little House adventure as \\"the most wonderful experience anyone could ever have.\\" He also says that he was very close to many of the cast members and that both Michael Landon and Victor French, his television dad, were father figures for him, having lost his own dad as a child.

It raises money to invest in medical research and the development of specialist doctors and nurses working in the field of reproductive health. Every year the charity invests in research projects and allocates funds towards the training of doctors and midwives. The charity also disseminates information on women's reproductive health. The charity is based in London, and consists of: a team of staff and volunteers; a board of trustees headed up by Sir Victor Blank; and a Research Advisory Committee. History1960s= The charity was established in 1964 by eminent obstetrician Professor Will Nixon, who was touched by the grief of a young man whose wife died during childbirth. It was originally called The Childbirth Research Centre. He gathered a group of illustrious founder members including Lord Brain, a neurologist who cared for Winston Churchill on his deathbed in 1965; Sir John Peel, the surgeon-gynaecologist to the Queen; Professor Dugald Baird and Sir George Pinker, an obstetrician who delivered nine royal babies including Princes William and Harry. The founders’ aim was to reduce the number of women and babies who died during pregnancy and childbirth. An early donation established that a deficiency in folic acid was a factor in malformed babies. Pregnant women across the world now take folic acid supplements. The charity also funded crucial research into epidurals which means that millions of women now benefit from a relatively pain-free birth. =1970s= In 1972 the charity was renamed Birthright. Research projects they funded created the ground rules that mean many thousands of women have safe laser treatment to treat cervical cancer. They also enabled breakthroughs into monitoring babies in the womb. One early pieces of research into the diagnosis of Down’s Syndrome in pregnant women helped make the amniocentesis test more accurate. The charity also discovered a link between smoking and pre-eclampsia and babies being born underweight. =1980s= HRH Diana, Prince of Wales, became the patron of Birthright in 1984. She was devoted to the charity, explaining: \\"To long for a baby and not to be able to have one must be devastating. I don't know how I would cope with that. And if my work for Birthright can alleviate that suffering for just one couple, it will have been all worthwhile.\\" During her time as patron, the charity funded work into IVF and also investigated HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer leading to the cervical cancer screening programme. The charity’s research into recurrent miscarriage also meant that, out of a research group of 2000 women who had been told they would never have children, 79% went on to have babies. Professor Stuart Campbell of King’s College, London, received funding from the charity for a project that developed an ultrasound that would identify babies at risk of stillbirth by finding out if they had abnormal blood flow. =1990s= During the 1990s, the charity funded research which discovered that ultrasound could be used to detect abnormalities in early pregnancy. This resulted in pre-natal screening for Down's Syndrome. The charity enabled breakthroughs in IVF, by funding research into the optimum time for embryo transfer, and by looking at how eggs mature in the ovary. This was described at the time as ‘the biggest advance in fertility treatment’. They also funded research into gynaecological cancers; contraception; and the bone density of post-menopausal women. =2000s= The charity was renamed ‘Wellbeing of Women’, in 2004. Wellbeing of Women partnered with 100 Women in Hedge Funds to fund a project which advanced our understanding of the genetics of Cerebral Palsy. The charity also funded research that helped reverse brain damage in newborn babies and a project that helped women suffering from recurrent miscarriage go on to have a successful pregnancy, by identifying ‘Natural Killer cells’ in the mother’s immune system. In 2007, then British Prime Minister's wife Sarah Brown became patron of Wellbeing of Women. In 2008, Wellbeing of Women was announced as one of the beneficiary charities of the Lord Mayor’s Appeal, along with ORBIS. Prince William was Patron of the appeal. Funds raised from the appeal enabled Wellbeing of Women to establish the Baby Bio Bank, a unique international resource storing genetic data from ‘family trios’ of mother, father and baby. This bank of genetic information will facilitate on-going research into the persistent complications of pregnancy and birth, including miscarriage, premature birth and pre-eclampsia. PresentCorporate Partners= In March 2013, Wellbeing of Women launched a major new partnership with PwC. PwC are long term sponsors of two of Wellbeing of Women's flagship events - the Annual Women's Lunch Debate and Annual Celebrity Cricket Match – but in 2013 broadened and increased their support of the charity, by supporting two Wellbeing of Women funded researchers. Wellbeing of Women has an ongoing partnership with BHS. Karren Brady designed a collection of workwear dresses to be sold at BHS in aid of the charity in 2012, and in 2013, Emma Forbes launched another collection of dresses to be sold in aid of the charity. In December 2011, in the run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics in Stratford, London, Clara Maidment shot a charity calendar in aid of Wellbeing of Women. Twelve British female sporting celebrities who posed in the lingerie of Nichole de Carle, wearing jewellery by Salima Hughes and Coster Diamonds. =Events= Wellbeing of Women runs a series of Literary Lunches at Fortnum & Mason, which feature a prominent author in conversation with Eve Pollard OBE or Baroness Jenkin of Kennington. Previous authors have included PD James, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Penny Vincenzi, Julian Fellowes and Ffion Hague. They also run a series called 'An Audience with...' at Fortnum and Mason.

A green box, stretched in the direction perpendicular to the METATOY, appears bent into a hyperbola when seen through the METATOY. A close-up view of the METATOY can be seen in the following picture. A METATOY is a sheet, formed by a two- dimensional array of small, telescopic optical components, that switches the path of transmitted light rays. METATOY is an acronym for \\"metamaterial for rays\\", representing a number of analogies with metamaterials; METATOYs even satisfy a few definitions of metamaterials, but are certainly not metamaterials in the usual sense. When seen from a distance, the view through each individual telescopic optical component acts as one pixel of the view through the METATOY as a whole. In the simplest case, the individual optical components are all identical; the METATOY then behaves like a homogeneous, but pixellated, window that can have very unusual optical properties (see the picture of the view through a METATOY). METATOYs are usually treated within the framework of geometrical optics; the light-ray-direction change performed by a METATOY is described by a mapping of the direction of any incoming light ray onto the corresponding direction of the outgoing ray. The light-ray- direction mappings can be very general. METATOYs can even create pixellated light-ray fields that could not exist in non-pixellated form due to a condition imposed by wave optics. Much of the work on METATOYs is currently theoretical, backed up by computer simulations. A small number of experiments have been performed to date; more experimental work is ongoing. Examples of METATOYs Close-up view of a METATOY formed by an array of upright Dove prisms, seen from above. The view through the METATOY is shown in the previous image. Telescopic optical components that have been used as the unit cell of two-dimensional arrays, and which therefore form homogeneous METATOYs, include a pair of identical lenses (focal length f) that share the same optical axis (perpendicular to the METATOY) and that are separated by 2 f, that is they share one focal plane (a special case of a refracting telescope with angular magnification -1); a pair of non-identical lenses (focal lengths f_1 and f_2) that share the same optical axis (again perpendicular to the METATOY) and that are separated by f_1 + f_2, that is they again share one focal plane (a generalization of the former case, a refracting telescope with any angular magnification); a pair of non-identical lenses (focal lengths f_1 and f_2) that share one focal plane, that is, they share the direction of the optical axis, which is not necessarily perpendicular to the METATOY, and they are separated by f_1 + f_2 (a generalization of the former case); a prism; and a Dove prism Examples of inhomogeneous METATOYs include the moiré magnifier, which is based on deliberately \\"mis-aligned\\" pairs of confocal microlens arrays; Fresnel lenses, which can be seen as non-homogeneous METATOYs made from prisms; and frosted glass, which can be seen as an extreme case of an inhomogeneous, random METATOY made from prisms. Examples of METATOYs as defined above have existed long before analogies with metamaterials were noted and it was recognized that METATOYs can perform wave-optically forbidden ray- direction mappings (in pixellated form). Wave-optical constraints on light- ray fields and METATOYs Wave optics describes light at a more fundamental level than geometrical optics. In the ray-optics limit (in which the optical wavelength tends towards zero) of scalar optics (in which light is described as a scalar wave, an approximation that works well for paraxial light with uniform polarization), the light-ray field r(x,y,z) corresponding to a light wave u(x,y,z) is its phase gradient, > \\\\mathbf{r}(x,y,z)= abla \\\\phi(x,y,z), where \\\\phi(x,y,z) is the phase of the wave u(x,y,z)=A(x,y,z) \\\\exp(i \\\\phi(x,y,z)). But according to vector calculus, the curl of any gradient is zero, that is > abla \\\\times abla \\\\phi(x,y,z)=0, and therefore > abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{r}(x,y,z)=0. This last equation is a condition, derived from wave optics, on light-ray fields. (Each of the three equations that makes up this vector equation expresses the symmetry of the second spatial derivatives, which is how the condition was initially formulated.) Using the example of ray-rotation sheets, it was shown that METATOYs can create light-ray fields that do not satisfy the above condition on light-ray fields. Relationship with metamaterials METATOYs are not metamaterials in the standard sense. The acronym \\"metamaterial for rays\\" was chosen because of a number of similarities between METATOYs and metamaterials, which are discussed below, along with the differences. In addition, metamaterials provided the inspiration for early METATOYs research, as summarized in the following quote: > Motivated by the desire to build optical elements that have some of the > visual properties of metamaterials on an everyday size scale and across the > entire visible wavelength spectrum, we recently started to investigate > sheets formed by miniaturized optical elements that change the direction of > transmitted light rays. =Similarities with metamaterials= In a number of ways, METATOYs are analogous to metamaterials: structure: metamaterials are arrays of small (sub- wavelength size) wave-optical components (electro-magnetic circuits resonant with the optical frequency), whereas METATOYs are arrays of small (so that they work well as pixels), telescopic, \\"ray-optical components\\"; functionality: both metamaterials and METATOYs can behave like homogeneous materials, in the case of metamaterials a volume of material, in the case of METATOYs a sheet material, in both cases with very unusual optical properties such as negative refraction. =Differences with metamaterials= Arguably amongst the most startling properties of metamaterials are some that are fundamentally wave-optical, and therefore not reproduced in METATOYs. These include amplification of evanescent waves, which can, in principle, lead to perfect lenses (\\"superlenses\\") and magnifying superlenses (\\"hyperlenses\\"); reversal of the phase velocity; reversal of the Doppler shift. However, because they are not bound by wave-optical constraints on light-ray fields, it can be argued that METATOYs can perform light-ray-direction changes that metamaterials could not, unless a METATOY was effectively built out of metamaterials.

The centre has of floor space, ranking it as the joint 60th largest shopping centre in the UK according to a 2008 survey by Retail Week. Together with the Fremlin Walk shopping centre, which is uncovered, it is one of the two primary shopping venues within the town centre. History View from the lower level of The Mall Maidstone The Mall Maidstone was built in 1976 as the 'Stoneborough Centre,' with a 7-storey office block on the top, named 'Stoneborough House.' In the 1990s, the shopping centre was rebranded as 'Chequers Shopping Centre,' to coincide with works on the main entrances and refurbishment work that was going on at the time. The office block above retained its original name. The centre opened with a Sainsbury's supermarket, which closed and relocated to a separate building immediately east of the bus station in 2000.Sainsbury's Archive https://sainsburyarchive.org.uk/catalogue/search/branch/ref/p426-maidstone- stoneborough-centre-1976-2000-sainsburys-branch In 2005, the centre was purchased by The Mall Fund, who once again set about refurbishing the centre with their own, distinctive pink corporate branding. An agreement was subsequently signed that Maidstone Borough Council would move into the office block on top of the centre, after extensive refurbishment of that, and the construction of a 'Gateway' reception area. The council signed a 99-year lease and took up residence in May 2007, with the block renamed 'Maidstone House'. Today, The Mall Maidstone hosts a wide variety of shops, from independent retailers to big chain names like Sports Direct. It is a key part of the town centre, also containing the Chequers Bus Station, retaining the old name, which serves as the main bus terminus for the town. In December 2012 the Arriva Travel Shop closed after trading for many years in the centre. In June 2013 the Beales Outlet store shut after only a year in the centre. it was in the largest store in The Mall. =Chequers Bus Station= Entrance to the Chequers bus station The town's main bus station is housed within the building, between the main shopping area and the Sainsbury's supermarket. The station takes the form of a two-way \\"tunnel\\" underneath the car park levels. Stops H1 to H5 are on the west side, and stops J1 to J6 are on the east side. There was also an Arriva travel shop which had closed in 2012 and remains empty The main operators are Arriva Southern Counties and Nu-Venture. Buses run from the bus station to several destinations in the Maidstone area such as Barming and Park Wood, Buses also travel to destinations outside the local area such as the Medway Towns and Sittingbourne. The bus station is managed by Maidstone Borough Council.

The Battle of Nachod the previous day (June 27, 1866) set the scene for Steinmetz to advance on Skalitz (Česká Skalice) where he defeated Archduke Leopold. Events Having been beaten the previous day by Steinmetz at Nachod, the Austrians had regrouped at the Aupa heights near Skalice, a town with only one bridge over the river Aupa. There Ramming's VI Corps was relieved by Archduke Leopold's VIII Corps. Benedek, having reached the field and scouted the terrain, decided by 11:00 am to abandon any thought of counterattacking the Prussians with the combined VI, VIII and IV Corps, resumed his march towards Jičín, and ordered the VIII Corps to abandon Skalice if by 2:00 pm no serious battle had started. After transmitting these orders Benedek departed towards his main army. Merely 15 minutes after Benedek left, the battle erupted. While the Austrians prevaricated, Steinmetz decided at 8:30 am to send eight infantry battalions and three batteries of the 9th Division to test the VIII Corps' left flank, while his 10th Division would engage and pin the Austrian center. By 11:00 the 9th Division was nearing the Fragnern brigade and the Prussians infiltrated the tactically vital Dubno Forest. At 12:30 Fragnern on his own initiative decided to use his brigade to dislodge the Prussians in the woods and he left his strong position atop the hill to attack them in the woods. General Fragnern's charge was met by concentrated Prussian infantry fire from the Dreyse needle gun and he was killed and 3,000 men of his brigade were killed or wounded. Fragnern's brigade was shattered and abandoned the field in panic. The next brigade in the Austrian line, Kreyssern's, was then sucked into the ill conceived Austrian counter push. Feeling obliged to shore up Fragnern's faltering brigade, General Kreyssern sent five battalions to support the fleeing regiments from Fragnern's command. Kreyssern's battalions were met by a Prussian grenadier regiment from 9th Division and a brigade from 10th Division near the railway embankment. Kreyssern was killed during the fire fight and his brigade collapsed, enabling the Prussians to reach Skalice's railway station. 10th Division then attacked VIII Corps' center and right while 9th Division turned the Austrian left flank. At 2:15 pm, recognizing the danger of being cut off from his lone bridge, Archduke Leopold ordered VIII Corps to retreat, which turned into a headlong flight. By 3:00 pm the Prussians had taken Skalice. Results Having been led by an incompetent princely commander who, according to Wawro, did not give a single order during the battle, and subordinates launching attacks without orders, the Austrian VIII Corps was badly mauled. In all it lost about 6,000 men, amongst which were 3,000 prisoners. As a cause of the battle, Benedek prevaricated and halted Northern Army's advance on Jičín, which enabled the Prussian armies to link up and envelop his army, and ultimately lead to his defeat at Königgrätz.Geoffrey Wawro, The Austro-Prussian War.

Plot Friends Cowboy, Indian, and Horse live in a rural house together peacefully. Cowboy and Indian forget Horse's birthday, and come up with the idea of building him a brick barbecue. Not wanting Horse to find out they forgot, they get him out of the house by convincing their neighbor Steven to ask Horse to pick his animals up from the nearby music school. There, Horse meets his love interest, Mrs. Jacqueline Longray, a fellow horse who is also a music teacher. When he attempts to play piano for her, she offers to give him lessons. Back at the house, Indian attempts to order the fifty bricks needed for the grill, but Cowboy accidentally orders fifty million. They get rid of the excess bricks by building them into a cube and putting them on top of the house, then build the grill. That night, the house collapses under the weight of the bricks. Irate, Horse makes Cowboy and Indian help rebuild the house. When they try to put up the walls, an unknown figure continues to steal them. When staking out the house to find the culprits, the trio discover the walls are being stolen by a family of aquatic creatures whose heads are shaped like cones. All but one of them escape with the wall. They chase the straggler, Gerard, off of a cliff, where they fall into the earth's core. Gerard escapes. Climbing out, they find themselves in the middle of a tundra. While wandering through out, they are sucked into a giant penguin robot that is being used by incomprehensible, super-strong scientists to make and throw giant snowballs. They catch up with Gerard, but they are all subsequently captured and put to work by the scientists. While the scientists battle a rogue mammoth, the group escapes by setting a snowball to launch at the house and climbing into it. At the last second, Gerard sets it for his home under the sea. Gerard swims off when the snowball lands and the three give chase, donning scuba masks (Cowboy simply puts a TV on his head) and swimming after him. They find an underwater version of their house, revealing Gerard and his family wanted the walls to build their own house. The creatures chase the trio off with a group of barracudas, but they come back and trick the creatures into a hole by Horse posing as Santa Claus. They use a sawfish to destroy their house and escape to the surface, but the creatures follow them and attack with swordfish. Steven, his wife, and his animals help fight back. In the process, Steven's house explodes with water and the countryside is flooded. One year later, Gerard's family is an accepted part of the community, and Horse is now a skilled piano player and dating Longray, who throws a surprise birthday party for him in an underwater department store. Cowboy and Indian accidentally set off Horse's birthday president, a giant firework, causing a giant fireworks display that destroys the landscape as the credits roll.

History The Girl Scout Council of the Nation's Capital as we know it today was formed in 1963 and encompassed five area councils that were in existence at that time, plus Calvert and Charles Counties in Maryland, and lone troops in Prince William, Loudoun, and Fauquier Counties in Virginia. The merger that built GSCNC was very carefully crafted with full consideration given to all the councils and lone troops that were to merge. Prior to the merger, there was a year-long study made by a group composed of both GSUSA and the local councils. Under consideration was the real need of delivering the required services to girls so that all the girls could benefit from a strong and diverse program. The first meeting for the actual merger was on Friday, March 2, 1962. A committee of 15 was formed. In 2004, the national organization began a series of mergers and realignment of the Girl Scout Councils throughout the nation. The purpose of this realignment is to create high-capacity councils, with volunteers, staff and financial resources to serve growing numbers of girls. By the end of 2009, this nationwide effort to combine councils reduced the number of Girl Scout Councils from 313 to 109. In 2006 the Penn Laurel Girl Scout Council in Frederick County, Maryland merged into GSCNC. In October 2009, Shawnee Council with 5,000 members and 491 troops in 14 counties, merged into GSCNC. Organization GSCNC is headquartered in Washington, DC with satellite offices in Brandywine and Germantown, Maryland; Kingstown and South Riding, Virginia; and Martinsburg, West Virginia. GSCNC employs 115 full-time employees. The 2017 Operating Budget was $16M. As of the 2017 membership year, membership for the Council is over 87,000, including 60,000 girls and 27,000 adult volunteers. Programs and activities In 2017, 188 girls, earned the Gold Award, the highest level of achievement for a Girl Scout. In 2010, Girl Scouts sold over 4.7 million boxes of Girl Scout Cookies. Other programs include: Congressional Aide internships, Girl Scout Day at the National Air and Space Museum, DC Step Showcase, a Girl Scout performance of the Washington Ballet's Nutcracker, easy-to-do program kits for leaders, and programs in partnership with local museums and vendors. To encourage inclusion in all activities the “Including All Girls” patch program was launched and GSCNC served 522 girls with disabilities during camp programs. GSCNC trained 1,907 volunteers through online and home study training courses in 2008. To attract graduating college seniors into volunteer roles with Girl Scouts, the Young Leader Program placed 118 college students as troop leaders at 54 sites in the District of Columbia and Prince George’s County. SHARE, the council’s annual giving campaign raised $593,215 in 2008. In addition, over one million dollars was raised from foundations, corporations and government agencies. GSCNC provided $417,930 in financial aid to girls and adults to participate in GSCNC activities, start troops and fund camp fees. Camping GSCNC owns and operates eight camps. In 2017, Girl Scouts introduced a new high ropes course at Camp White Rock, which includes tight ropes, cargo and raider bridge and a 300 ft zip line. During the summer months four camps are used as sleep-away camps.

Mohen (born July 19, 1956) is CEO of Chimes Broadcasting, having been CEO of Nylon Media, best known for having been founder and CEO and co- founder of election.com, which ran the Arizona Democratic Primary in March 2000, the world’s first legally binding election conducted on the Internet,CNN Democratic Convention Coverage, Aired August 14, 2000 - 7:00 p.m. ET http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0008/14/se.02.html according to the company.. He has also been an investor in bioplastics. Mohen was also a force in creating the era of free legal music, as the founder of SpiralFrog, an ad- supported free music service, which even before Spotify was able secure the rights to free music distribution from the major record labels in return for a share of the advertising revenues; SpiralFrog ultimately failed because it relied on a temporary download model, rather than streaming, but the licensees that he negotiated paved the way for the streaming music era. In March 2016, Mohen published a guest blog predicting the collapse of baseball World Series television revenues unless its schedule is revamped. Early life and childhood Mohen was born in the New York City borough of Queens, the oldest of twelve children of Joseph Conrad Mohen (1935-2017) and Virginia Ann (Kelly) Mohen (born 1935), both descendants of Irish immigrants. His maternal great- grandfather, James Morris, an immigrant from Liverpool, was one of the first full time staff of any motion picture studio, being hired by Adolph Zukor in 1912, at Famous Players, making sets for the silent films at Chelsea Studios in Manhattan; Famous Players was later merged with a competitor and renamed Paramount Pictures. In 1960, when Mohen was four, the family moved to Garden City on Long Island. There he attended a local Catholic School, St. Anne’s, and later an Episcopal Preparatory School, St. Paul’s; while in high school he attended Boys State, and was captain of the Cross Country and Track teams. He was offered a track scholarship to the University of Ohio, which he declined, instead electing to attend Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore where he studied Mathematics and Biochemistry, and Manhattan College in New York City studying Business.Manhattan College International Study Web Site http://www.studygroup.com/isc/manhattan/graduation_alumni.aspx Early career Mohen started his career working for Chase Bank on Wall Street, and became an officer at Citibank at 24 years old. Having worked as a software engineer for six years, Mohen became a Certified Computer Professional in Systems Development in 1985. The following year he founded Proginet Corporation of which he served as CEOHighBeam until September 1996, and remained a Chairman through 1998.Cisco Announcement In 1987, Proginet created a complex software package called XCOM, which sold in 1992 to a predecessor company of Computer Associates, and was one of the software products to span more than eleven computer operating systems. The renamed CA-XCOM was sold by Computer Associates through 2017. As CEO, Mohen secured equity stakes from both Novell and Microsoft in Proginet; Proginet was later acquired by Tibco Software. Mohen also was a contributing editor and columnist for PC Week (now eWeek), Data Communications Magazine, and Network World; in 1989, he wrote a widely quoted article, called \\"Seeking a Cure for the Vaporware Epidemic\\", writing \\"my own estimate is that at the time of announcement, 10% of software products don't actually exist ... Vendors that are unwilling to [prove it exists] shouldn't announce their packages to the press\\", blaming the press for not investigating claims by developers, saying \\"If the pharmaceutical industry were this careless, I could announce a cure for cancer today – to a believing press.\\" In 1990-1992, Mohen was a committee member for setting standards for Open Systems Interconnections Protocols, with representatives from computer and telecommunications organizations from around the world. election.com Joe Mohen and Hillary Clinton in 2000 Mohen co-founded election.com, with which in 1999 he was able to recruit Jack Kemp and former Irish Taoiseach (i.e. Prime Minister) Garret FitzGerald to the board. election.com [sic] is best known for administering the 2000 Arizona Democratic presidential primary Internet election. The company, originally called Votation.com, was started in part with equity investments from VeriSign and Accenture. In February election.com acquired NewVoter.com with then internet entrepreneur and civil rights advocate Mark Strama (who was subsequently elected to the Texas State legislature in 2004), who joined election.com as Vice President. During the second week of March 2000, election.com administered the Arizona Democratic Presidential Primary, which was the first time in American history that a statewide election offered citizens the choice to cast their ballots over the web. The candidates were Vice President Al Gore, Senator Bill Bradley, and Dr. Heather Harder. Voter turnout was shocking: turnout was up more 500% versus the previous primary, and more than double the previous record turnout. Six months later, the Internet Corporation for Assigning Names and Numbers (ICANN), the technical coordination body for the internet, chose election.com to run their worldwide vote for its board of directors. Voters came from every continent.< Mohen expanded the company to New York, Washington, Texas, London, Paris, Sydney, Australia, and Christchurch, New Zealand, and saw Election.com named to the Red Herring 100, as well as its top 50 Private Companies list.< Mohen stepped down as CEO of election.com in 2001. Two years after Mohen left, the public sector elections business of election.com was acquired by Accenture. Automating Catholic Church finance In late 2001, Mohen founded ParishPay, which automated handling of money for churches around the United States. The company replaced the envelop system, whereby donations were placed into envelops each Sabbath, with a system in which parish members could have their donations automatically debited from their bank or credit card accounts each month. Shortly after its launch, the system was featured in a front page story in the New York Times, after signing the Catholic Dioceses of Chicago, San Jose, and Orlando, and ParishPay received Venture Capital financing in late 2002. Mohen sold his interest In ParishPay to start SpiralFrog, although ParishPay grew substantially and was later merged with SmartTuition; ParishPay was sold to Yapstone in April 2012. Digital music and SpiralFrog Joe Mohen at the 2004 Grammys Mohen started SpiralFrog, Inc. in an effort to create a market driven solution to digital music piracy. In 2004, a focus group in New York City was held to determine how to solve the problem of young people stealing music. One of the attendeeshttp://www.contributeonline.org/article/484611/?k=j83s12y12h94s27k02 in the focus group responded \\"Why don’t you just give away the music\\"….and show advertising during the downloads. Most doubted the four major record labels would ever go along with the idea, especially the largest music company – Universal Music Group, Mohen set out to recruit directors from music and advertising to obtain the needed licenses. Among those recruited included former CEOs Jay Bernman (IFPI), Frances Preston (BMI), and Robin Kent (Interpublic Universal McCann). Finally, on August 28, 2006, the Financial Times reported in its lead story, that it had granted SpiralFrog the first ever license to give away its complete catalog of music to consumers for free, in return for a share of the advertising revenues. \\"This is really promising that the labels are going to finally stop kvetching and start thinking intelligently about where their money's going to come from in the 21st century,\\" said Aram Sinnreich, of Radar Research, being quoted in the Los Angeles Times. \\"SpiralFrog is one small step for the record labels, one great leap for music kind.\\" While SpiralFrog service was one of the earliest free internet music services to be supported by advertising instead of charging users, predating Spotify and YouTube music by several years, it used a temporary download model, which was not compatible with Apple or Android devices. The launch of SpiralFrog was delayed, due to technical and licensing delays, and an internal control fight. Robin Kent, the British advertising executive who had been recruited by Mohen the year before, attempted a spectacular corporate takeover in December 2006, which was widely reported in the press. Mohen emerged the winner in what was later known as the \\"Boxing Day Massacre\\", but most industry observers believed that SpiralFrog.com would never launch. Mohen continued to insist that he would overcome these obstacles and launch the site. He went on to sign all remaining major music publishers, and performing rights societies, financed the company with exchangeable debt, and SpiralFrog.com finally launched on September 17, 2007. In June 2008, Mohen concluded an agreement with the British music company EMI, whose catalog was added to SpiralFrog prior to the Coldplay Viva La Vida tour. However the collapse of the stock market in September 2008, and the ensuing credit crisis, combined with contraction of the advertising markets, left SpiralFrog unable to meet its collateralized note agreements. SpiralFrog was particularly vulnerable to the credit crisis because it was debt financed as opposed to equity financed, and its backers were hedge funds who were themselves facing huge redemptions. Its loans were called and SpiralFrog was forced to close. Retrospectively, while other free ad supported music services that came later did succeed like Spotify, the SpiralFrog download (rather than streaming) model limited the number of devices on which SpiralFrog could be used, and ultimately prevent its long term success. Fashion Media and Nylon Magazine In May 2014, Mohen was part of a group, also including Dana Fields, that purchased Nylon Magazine, a fashion magazine for young women that focused on gritty street fashion, which was merged with digital media company FashionIndie. Following the merger, he became interim CEO of the combined company, and served as an adviser afterwards. The Nylon Media transaction was significant because it laid the foundation for the transformation of a traditional media print business into one that was primarily digital, facilitated in part by the young demographic of its audience, part by the merger with the fashion blogger company, and because of the focus of the new management team. Chimes Broadcasting and Holograms In 2014 Mohen was named CEO of Chimes Broadcasting. The company has two lines of business. It has the world's first television network dedicated to broadcasting holographic television programs; it also acquired massive music databases and had begun repurposing those databases to consolidate search results related to music, in a similar way that Amazon had already consolidated the search results related to film and television with IMDb. The company also pioneered blockchain music applications. Awards and miscellaneous Mohen, top row, far right, next to New York Governor David Patterson July 2010, and son Matthew, in catchers gear Mohen gave the keynote address at the Interop Conference in Washington in 1993, and an address to the South African Technology leadership in Pretoria in 1990 on transition after Apartheid. He won the Long Island Software Awards in 1997, 2000, and 2008. He is a former member of the National Association of Corporate Directors Blue Ribbon Commission on Corporate Governance, and of Legatus, the organization of Catholic Chief Executive Officers. Mohen was also selected to speak onstage with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer when Microsoft announced that it had broken the previous record for the TPS benchmark for scalable systems in September 2000. He served on the Interactive Advertising Bureau's Broadband Committee in 2006. In June 2011, the Montreal based technology accelerator program, FounderFuel, selected Mohen among its Entrepreneur Mentors, along with David Cancel, David Hauser, and Jean- Sebastien Cournoyer, among others. In 2013, Mohen published two controversial and provocative Op Ed pieces on digital media in Computerworld and Ad Age. The former chastises text book publishers for failing to make all the text books available in electronic form, while the latter states that vendor claims about a new advertising technology, Real Time Bidding, are over-hyped. Mohen has been active in the charity organized by Major League Baseball for keeping minority and underprivileged youth active in sports. He ran the Long Island, New York, chapter of Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI), through Garden City Bombers Baseball non-profit organization, of which he was one of the founders; this organizations combines young people from minority and affluent neighborhoods on the same baseball teams, and combines the teaching of baseball skills, with academic support, and other life lessons.\\"GC Bombers Baseball Announces Instruction Program\\" , The Garden City News, April 11, 2008 In 2006 and 2007, he organized a number of baseball tournaments in the Dominican Republic, and in July 2010 he helped organize the first Governor's tee ball game at the Executive Mansion in Albany, New York.

The scheme preys on desperate homeowners whose mortgages are in default by offering to prevent the foreclosure.http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_26/b4040041.htmhttps://www.usnews.com/articles/business/real- estate/2008/08/07/how-to-avoid-foreclosure-rescue-scams.html There are various ways in which foreclosure rescue schemes work, causing different types of harm to the homeowners, but all ultimately with the likely end result of the owner being forced out of his/her home and losing even more money. Foreclosure rescue schemes are typically advertised in a variety of informal settings, such as roadside signs. Types of foreclosure rescue schemes There are several ways foreclosure rescue schemes operate: =Lease-buyback= In a lease-buyback scheme, the owner turns the lease over with an option to buy it back later. The owner is promised to be able to rent the property back, which will be counted toward an eventual buyback. These can be legitimate; however, in a scam they may end in loss of the property or considerable additional cost: the renting prices may be made so high that the original owner cannot afford to continue paying and/or the buyback price may be set far above the fair market value of the property.http://www.seattlepi.com/local/285940_mortgagescam21.html =Equity stripping= Equity stripping or equity skimming is a variation on lease- buyback and is one of the most common types of foreclosure rescue schemes.https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/money/20071109/foreclosurescams.art.htm In it, the perpetrator assumes ownership of the house while allowing the former owner to continue living there, provided that s/he pay rent to the perpetrator, who is the new owner. The perpetrator often claims this ownership is temporary, and the victim will later reassume ownership of the home once the terms of the loan are renegotiated. But after taking over the deed to the house, the perpetrator cashes out all the equity in the home. The perpetrator also collects money from the victim by charging rent to the victim for living in the house while not owning it. The final result is eviction from the house with zero equity paired with greater financial loss to the victim. The perpetrator, who then has ownership of the home, will either sell the property or allow it to go into foreclosure.http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami- dade/story/987802.html =Consulting service= A firm may offer to act as an agent to renegotiate the terms of a loan with the lender, in return for a fee. The firms are unlikely to have any better negotiation power so the value of the fee may be disproportionate to the service received, the firm may be unable to negotiate any better terms or in the worst cases may not contact the lender. Firms may also encourage the original borrower to avoid any contact with the lender, under the guise that such contact would interfere with their efforts to secure a modification, when in fact it might reveal that the firm has not contacted the lender at all. Wednesday, August 19, 2020 When negotiation does take place the firm may put in place a deal to buy the property from the lender, if the equity value of the property has reduced, then this may be at a lower price than the current outstanding debt. Lenders may accept this to guarantee payment now, rather than gamble on future values, ability of the owner to pay etc. In these cases the situation can be similar to the other schemes with the original owner being offered the option to rent the property with a future buy back. As for the other schemes in a scam situation the terms of any tenancy or buy back may also be set to the gross disadvantage of the original owner. =Loan modification scam= In this case a firm will market to you aggressively to help you get a loan modification. These scammers target the homes of older seniors with equity which are the types that servicers usually won't modify. They may help you get a modification for a rental property first in order to win your trust. When they get to the property with equity they will trick you into missing payments, convince you to ignore the notice of default and notice of trustee's sale, and trick you into missing your sale date - all while telling you they are getting you a modification. Meanwhile, they will feed the property to their investors who will be waiting at the foreclosure sale to scoop up your hidden gem.

The series began as the replacement for ABC's Big Picture Show and as a revival of ABC's Movie of the Week theme (the network used this theme from 1969 until 1976). Since its inception, it has been ABC's main platform for airing theatrical movies, although other movies air as part of the movie of the week format during the holiday season and as special presentations. Other presentations of Disney's animated films are placed under Wonderful World of Disney as an umbrella title. Overview Beginning in 2009, with the December 2008 cancellation of Wonderful World of Disney as a regular series, ABC Saturday Movie of the Week has become ABC's main platform for all movies. Currently the title is used solely for internal scheduling purposes; either a short promotional piece listing the film coming up or a direct cut to a disclaimer that the film has been formatted to broadcast television presentation precedes the aired film, along with noting time stretching done with extra commercial breaks and \\"bonus content\\" to fill out the three-hour timeslot. The use of the second audio program also varies wildly, with some weeks featuring the film's Spanish language dub, and others with a Descriptive Video Service track. Among the films which ABC had broadcast rights to are a package of DreamWorks films, which have since passed to NBC after Comcast's purchase of Dreamworks. The two lone permanent annual airings of any film in the series are those of The Ten Commandments, which has aired on ABC since 1973 and airs in an extended time slot each year in the vicinity of Easter, and The Sound of Music, which has aired on ABC since 2002, and traditionally airs the week before Christmas. The Ten Commandments is also generally the most watched film of the series each year. Generally, since the premiere of Saturday Night Football in 2006 and the major decline of new programming on all broadcast networks on Saturday nights, along with other factors such as networks ending their purchase of all but the most high- profile of films and the rise of streaming options, ABC's Saturday movie schedule is mainly only used to fill weeks where ABC has no sports or news programming to fill the timeslot. Saturday Night Football generally airs from September to mid-December and holiday specials in December, with NBA Saturday Primetime on ABC airing from mid-January until May into the NBA playoffs, and encore episodes of other ABC series and re-compilation episodes of 20/20 filling other Saturday nights.

The propositions, derived from Aristotle's Physics and Metaphysics, were merely summarised by Maimonides; Tabrizi gives a detailed discussion of them, based on the work of Arabic authors. It is the earliest known commentary on a part of the Guide.Remark in Colette Sirat, Nicholas de Lange (2002), Hebrew manuscripts of the Middle Ages, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . p. 284 Tabrizi's book was later translated into a strongly Arabicised Hebrew by Isaac ben Nathan of Cordoba. This translation formed the main basis of Hasdai Crescas's review in Or Adonai of the various demonstrations proposed for Maimonides's principles, prior to his embarking on a thorough critique of their inadequacies; it was also used by Moses ben Joshua of Narbonne. The translation was probably made in Majorca around 1347; it was printed in Ferrara in 1556. A second translation, into a more native idiomatic Hebrew, also exists in manuscript.

The JMP begins with two and a half years at UC Berkeley, where students complete the basic science component of their medical education while concurrently completing a Masters of Science in health and medical sciences. Students then matriculate to the UCSF School of Medicine for two and a half years of clinical clerkships at UCSF-affiliated hospitals. At the end of this 5-year program, students graduate with an M.D. from UCSF and an M.S. from UC Berkeley. Admissions Applicants submit their primary applications to the UCSF School of Medicine through the normal AMCAS application process. After a preliminary screening, a secondary application is requested, which includes a supplemental application to the JMP. An additional round of screening leads to invitations to visit the JMP for interviews. Successful applicants are then accepted on a rolling basis. The JMP class has 16 students each year. Curriculum The JMP Master's in Health and Medical Sciences and the JMP Helix medical curriculum ensure that JMP students enter their post-graduate training with a deep understanding of the social, behavioral, and ethical aspects of medicine and are well equipped to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving healthcare system. Additionally, the PRIME-US program is a joint opportunity with UCSF providing additional learning opportunities to work with urban underserved communities. And finally, the abundant opportunities available at UC Berkeley provide JMP students with an amazing place to learn and to be inspired. The last two and a half years are spent doing clinical clerkships at UCSF with 3rd and 4th year students from the traditional program. This time is the equivalent of parts 2 and 3 of UCSF's Bridges curriculum. = Helix Medical Curriculum = The Helix medical curriculum consists of two complementary strands: Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Workplace Learning & Patient Care. The intertwined strands integrate learning in both classroom and clinical settings. Students’ medical knowledge and clinical skills develop together, as they are applied together in the care of patients. = Problem Based Learning = The practice of PBL is a journey of continuous discovery and knowledge integration. The goals of PBL are not necessarily solving the problems in the cases, but instead identifying learning opportunities, integrating the foundational science underlying medical knowledge, building on previous knowledge, and actively teaching and learning. Most excitingly for students to experience and faculty to watch unfold, through case-based learning JMP students learn to think like doctors. = Workplace Learning & Patient Care = The JMP Helix medical curriculum is designed to optimize the learning-to-practice continuum by interweaving classroom and workplace learning opportunities. What starts in the classroom with PBL, expert instruction, workshop practice and simulation, is extended with students’ placements in real clinical settings in the Workplace Learning curricular strand. Clinical preceptorships begin in the fall of the first year and continue throughout the 3 years. =Masters Thesis Curriculum= The M.S. degree is an academic degree in Health and Medical Sciences and requires writing a research thesis. The topic must be health-related and the research supported by a coherent and scholarly program of study approved by the Master's Faculty. In addition to the thesis research project, Masters classes are also taken throughout the two and a half years at UC Berkeley.

The Evening Bells (1892). Evening Bell (Вечерний звон) is a popular Russian song written in 1828 by Ivan Kozlov and Alexander Alyabyev. The lyrics are adapted from a Russian-themed verse by Thomas Moore. LyricsEnglish original= In 1818 Thomas Moore published his first collection of National Airs, a collection of songs which included his verses and musical scores by John Andrew Stevenson. The title of one verse from the Russian airs was Those Evening Bells with the subtitle Air: The bells of St.Petersburg. It starts with: Those evening bells! Those evening bells! How many a tale their music tells, Of youth, and home, and those sweet time, When last I heard their soothing chime. .. Moore mentioned that the verse was based on a Russian original, but all attempts to find the original failed. One hypothesis put forward in 1885 traced the source of the song to George the Hagiorite, an Orthodox monk and writer of the 11th century from the Iviron monastery on Mount Athos). Soviet researchers tried to prove the link, but found no traces of such a song. The most likely conclusion is that the verse is Thomas Moore's original creation loosely based on Russian-related themes. The verse was quite well known in the English-speaking world, e.g., it was satirised by Thomas Hood (Those Evening Bells, those Evening Bells, How many a tale their music tells, Of Yorkshire cakes and crumpets prime, And letters only just in time!. It was listed in the dictionary of familiar quotations from 1919. =Kozlov's translation= Kozlov was a Russian poet in his own right, but also a prolific translator of contemporary English poetry (translating Byron, Charles Wolfe and Thomas Moore). His Russian text published in 1828 is more like an adaptation of the English original, as Kozlov used six-line stanzas instead of quatrains of the original, while being still faithful to the general mood and the rhythmic structure of the source (iambic tetrameter). His adaptation is credited with greater elaboration of the context, grounding the abstractness of the original with specific examples. { align=\\"center\\" class=\\"standard\\" + ! Thomas Moore ! Ivan Kozlov ! Literal back translation -----  Those evening Bells (Air: The bells of St.Petersburg)  Вечерний звон  Evening bell ----- Those evening bells! Those evening bells!

Как много дум наводит он О юных днях в краю родном, Где я любил, где отчий дом, И как я, с ним навек простясь, Там слушал звон в последний раз! ... Evening bell, evening bell! How many a thought it inspires. Of youth days in my native land, Where I loved, where my father's house is. And also of the moment when leaving it forever, I was hearing the bell there for the last time! ... + } When Kozlov published this verse, the original text was not mentioned. Combined with the fact that Moore's text claimed to be based on a Russian original, this brought some erroneous attributions (as early as in 1831) that Moore's verse is a translation of Kozlov's. Song  Soon after publication of the Russian translation, it was made into a song by Alexander Alyabyev, also in 1828. This music became immensely popular and resulted in variations on the same theme, as well as in completely different songs based on the same translation. The English original itself was published with music composed by John Andrew Stevenson. It also resulted in several other songs:Those evening bells * Harry Hill, (SSA, a cappella) * Charles Edward Ives (in 1907) * Harvey Worthington Loomis (in 1918, SSA, a cappella) * Henri Ketten (1848–1883)Those evening bells (music) /words by Thomas Moore; music by Henri Ketten  Other translations  There are two translations of the song into German (by Caroline Leonhardt Pierson and Henry Hugo Pierson, O Abendglocken, Abendhall, 1845), as well as into Polish (by Stanisław Moniuszko). Sergei Taneyev and Antoni Grabowski translated Moore's original verse into Esperanto under the title Sonoriloj de vesper (Evening bells).  Cover versions  Cover versions include: * \\"Nasdrovje womm\\" by Otto Waalkes Otto teaches the song to the audience.

Life John Coutts was born in 1810 in Aberdeen. Coutts was always regarded as a gifted Aberdonian from his precocious up-bringing. Coutts had been the son to a farmer named Patrick Coutts in Aberdeenshire. Had been titled one of the \\"Three Wise Men\\" from Arberdeen, Coutts was fundamental and the foundation to the innovative iron ship building industry in Tyneside. In 1839, the first iron made sailing ship, the \\"John Garrow\\", was built along with the help of his partner John Ronalds in his shipyard in Aberdeen. It was shortly thereafter in 1840 when Coutts moved south to Tyneside to go at it alone and open his own shipyard.Aberdeen's Links With Tyneside Shipbuilding The Doric Columns; 1/9/2014 John Coutts was very adamant about making it known he was not related to the well renowned and highly reputable Scottish Coutts Family, who was well known for banking. It was in 1840 when Coutts had traveled south to Tyneside to open his own shipyard in an old wooden shipyard at Low Walker on the Tyne. It was at this old wooden shipyard on the Tyne in 1842 that Coutts had built and then launched the famous P.S. Prince Albert; the first iron ship of substantial size to fare the seas and the river Thames.Shipbuilders on the Tyne with Shetland Ancestry In 1844, Coutts had built the Q.E.D. in his old shipyard in Tyneside. The Q.E.D. was an Iron- hulled barque ship. The Q.E.D. had an auxiliary engine system—an extremely pioneering system—along with the very innovative feature, and a world's first, of a water ballast; it carried double bottoms. These innovations weren't just for the novelty but would eventually become the norm many different industries especially in the collier trade. The elaborate water ballast had virtually replaced the sand-and-gravel ballasts that were the industry standard previously. In 1848, Coutts took William Parkinson as a partner and started a new trading company called Coutts and Parkinson; they had a shipyard at Willington Quay. In 1852, their yard built the 900 ton W. S. Lindsay, the largest iron ship that had been built to date for the eponymous merchant William Schaw Lindsay. She was designed to take emigrants to Australia and although she cost one-third more than similar vessels, the ship was three times more efficient with 280 cabins including 60 in first class. The vessel overturned in a storm in The Downs on her maiden voyage with 300 passengers aboard; she had to be towed back to London at a cost of £3,000. Coutts and Parkinson employed Charles Mitchell as a designer for their ships; Mitchell was considered to be one of the \\"Three Wise Men\\" from Aberdeen for the iron ship building industry in Tyneside. Coutts was known for hiring many of his employees from his hometown in Aberdeen: this was especially the case with his venture in Coutts and Parkinson at Willington Quay from the years 1849 through 1855.

Sponge diving is the oldest known form of the original art of underwater diving. Its purpose is to retrieve natural sponges for human use. Display of natural sponges for sale on Kalymnos in Greece Background Most sponges are too rough for general use due to their structural spicules composed of calcium carbonate or silica. But two genera, Hippospongia and Spongia, have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. These two genera are most commonly used by humans. It is unknown when exactly the sponge became an article of use. In Ancient Greek writings, Homer and Plato mentioned the sponge as an object used for bathing. Through trading, Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until the invention of synthetic sponges, they were used as cleaning tools, applicators for paints and ceramic glazes, and discreet contraceptives. However, by the mid-20th century, over-fishing had brought both the animals and the industry close to extinction. Many objects with sponge-like textures are now made of substances not derived from poriferans. Synthetic \\"sponges\\" include: personal and household cleaning tools, breast implants, and contraceptive sponges. History In Kalymnos, only 18% of the steep volcanic land could be cultivated, so the main occupations were trading, boat building and sponge fishing, which perhaps was the oldest occupation on the island. Diving for sponges brought social and economical development to the island: the freediving method was used. Kalymnos was the main centre of production in the Aegean, and is still a traditional albeit less common occupation of the Greeks on the Island with related exhibitions, along with other local folklore, and three museums about the occupation. When sponge diving, the crew went out into the Mediterranean Sea in a small boat, and used a cylindrical object with a glass bottom to search the sea floor for sponges. When one was found, a diver went overboard to get it. Freediving, he was usually naked and carried a skandalopetra, a rounded stone tied on a rope to the boat, to take him down to the bottom quickly. The diver then cut the sponge loose from the bottom and put a special net around it. Depth and bottom time depended on the diver's lung capacity. They often went down about for up to 5 minutes.

Zuyevo along ulitsa Lenina Savva Timofeyevich Morozov came from an Old Believer merchant family which held the hereditary civil rank of honorary citizen (). This gave him freedom from conscription, freedom from corporal punishment, and freedom from taxation (). He grew up at the Morozov house at Trehsvyatitelskaya Lane 1-3c1 () on Ivanovo Hill () in the White City (), now the boulevards, of Moscow. He attended nearby gymnasium at Pokrovsky Gates. His family home was the most expensive home in Moscow and its Morozov gardens () were a favourite place of S. Aksakov, F. Dostoevsky, A. Ostrovsky, L. Tolstoy, and P. Tchaikovsky. Later, he studied physics and mathematics at Moscow University (1885) where he wrote a study on dye and met Mendeleev. Beginning on 7 January 1885, at 10 o'clock in the morning, textile workers at the Morozov factories in Bogorodsk, especially Orekhovo-Zuyevo, went on strike for several weeks. In 1885–1887, he studied chemistry at the University of Cambridge (United Kingdom). While he was in England, he studied the structure of the textile industry in Great Britain, especially Manchester. Savva Morozov House built in 1893 He married his second cousin's wife Zinaida Grigorievna née Zimin ().Whims of Fate. Retrieved 17 May 2009 They hosted lavish parties and balls that many distinguished Russians and Moscovites attended including Savva Mamontov, Botkin, Feodor Chaliapin, Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekhov, Konstantin Stanislavski, Pyotr Boborykin, and others. On one of these balls recalled Olga Knipper, \\"I had to go to the ball at Morozova: I've never seen such luxury and wealth.\\" At the beginning of the twentieth century, Morozov was the largest shareholder of the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) under Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko. During the summer of 1902, Savva funded Schechtel's, with participation of both Ivan Fomin and Alexander Galetsky, improvements of the Lianozov owned theatre built in 1890 at Kamergersky Lane 3 in Tverskoy. The renovations incorporated Anna Golubkina's high relief plaster of The Wave above the right entrance of the theatre. In 1903, he funded the electrification of the theatre with its own electrical power station and added another small stage which is isolated from the main building to allow full rehearsals during performances on the main stage. All of this made the MAT the most advanced theatre in Russia. For the fifth and sixth seasons (1902–04), Morozov funded the entire cost of the equipment and the operating costs of the building, too. This new theatre had seating for 1200 which was a third more than the older building and greatly enhanced its profitability. However, the rent increased for the seventh season (1904–05) and Morozov ceased paying for the leasehold and the operating cost. He would only pay back the principle for the cost of the improvements which took 9 years. When Gorky's Summerfolk was not well received by Nemirovich-Danchenko and Stanislavski, Gorky left the theatre and Morozov followed. Influenced by Maxim Gorky, he and his nephew Nikolai Pavlovich Schmidt were significant financial contributors of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party including the newspaper Iskra. According to the author Suzanne Massie, in Land of the Firebird, Morozov had approached his mother and family matriarch about introducing profit sharing with factory workers, one of the first industrialists to propose such an idea. His mother angrily removed Savva from the family business and one month later apparently despondent Morozov shot himself while in the south of France. Morozov died from a gunshot wound in Cannes, France. His death was officially ruled a suicide; however, various murder theories exist.

This begins the history of Camp Bonnie Brae.Five College Archives & Manuscript Collections, Sophia Smith Collection, Camp Bonnie Brae Records, 1917-2007 (ongoing), Collection number: MS 592, Smith College, Northampton, MA 01063. The founders were Miss Edith Sinnett and Mrs Edith G. Newell. Unlike other organizations, the Girl Scouts have always been run completely by women. Unlike any other organizations, Girl Scouts have always had women in every position, top to bottom. The SGS set the vision of the camp experience as follows: “The girls will always be cheerful, a friend to every Girl Scout, they will enjoy camp fires and singing; they will be responsible by doing their tasks without shirking or complaining, by sharing and having fun. They also will respect nature, appreciate and utilize without harming it. They also will be courteous to old and new friends.” In 1911, William T. and Margaret L. Dakin sold their property to the Springfield Girl Scout Council (SGS) On March 12, 1914, William Dakin gave more land. In December 1915, the SGS bought several pieces of land for $1.00 each. In November 1916, they bought a piece of land for $7,000. Another large buy was in May 1917 for $2,500. And Margaret Dakin sold 143.2 acres of land for $10.00. She also reserved the island in the center of the pond (Big Pond) for herself. During the year of 1919, the Springfield Girl Scouts established “a committee to look into the matter of summer camp.” In the same year, they choose the camp at East Otis after “microscopical examinations.” To get to Camp Bonnie Brae, most of the campers traveled 20 miles on a trolley from Springfield, then would ride on the camp truck the other 15 miles to East Otis. Camp Bonnie Brae was the first camp to use the 'buddy system'. In 1919 the schedule was as follows: At 6:00 am you were woken up. Exercises followed at 6:15 am, then you would go swimming in the lake at 6:30 am. Breakfast was at 7:00 am. The program included nature study, sports and an overnight hike. No silk stockings or high-heels allowed! Uniform was a middy blouse and bloomers. The second year schedule remains as today: wake-up at 7:00 am. Swimming in the lake used to be early in the morning, but now it is saved for later in the day. The camp had 6 buildings: A main house, shed, farm house, barn and wonder house. In 1920, the mortgage was paid. In January 1925, the camp bought an unknown number of acres for $716.00. Traditional activities included Native American studies, dance, first aide, butterfly study, bugling, swimming, bird study, forestry, volley ball, obstacle golf, canoeing, signaling, and life-saving. Other work included astronomy, boating, child care, nursing, house-keeping, hiking, pioneering, and public health. The stated purpose of the camp experience was to provide a cheerful friend to every girl scout, to celebrate with campfires and singing, to learn responsibility by seeing through kapers without shirking or complaining, but by sharing and having fun; to respect nature with appreciation and utilize nature without harm, to be helpful and courteous and to have both old and new friends. Historical Note In 1920 the Girl Scout rankings were: Tender Foot, Second Class, First Class, Corporal and Patrol Leader. In the 1920s Camp Bonnie Brae had Bonnie Brae Echoes, a newspaper. It cost 5 cents. A feast known as the Nature's Bouquet was the closing feature of the camp season, which was a great success. In 1921, some of the tents were substituted by cabins for the younger girls. Sunday worship happened at camp, and scholarships were established. During the year of 1922, the girls were taught to make their beds. If you went in the summer of 1923, you would have been taught how to weave on a loom. There were more athletics, and a Trail's End club for older girls. In 1924 and 25, the camp got electricity, and an archery program was developed. Sherwood, Camelot and the Jungle units were established. By 1926, the girl scout council system of self-government was recognized nationally. In 1927, Camp Bonnie Brae was run by the Massachusetts Girl Scouts. There were 800 campers that season. In 1929, the Romani Patrin 'gypsy' unit was formed. As time went by, the end of program ceremonies became an important tradition in which girls created a skit, decorations, formations, poems and songs that were sung and played on instruments. Music and creativity continue to be a traditional component of girl scout camping. During the year of 1930, the councilor training unit began. The girls there lived in white army tents. By 1930, many of the tents were replaced by cabins for the younger campers. This year, they had fewer campers (402) but they were still open the full 8 weeks. The rankings changed over the years. In 1931 it went from Brownies to Tawny Owl to Brown Owl to Girl Scout, Lieutenant and Captain. In 1933, the camp store held emblems, cards, stamps, flashlight batteries, bathing caps, films, knives, ink, kotex, ties, notebooks, belts, toothpaste, stationary, pins, and many other useful items. In 1935, Anchorage officially became a unit. There were 389 campers that year. In 1937, Miss Sinnett begins to develop a long range plans to meet the needs of both the younger and older girls at camp. The dining hall began to fail, and new construction began in 1938. Also in 1938, the boating program was instated which continued into 1956. A totem pole was built, and the girls would sing around it. Two other Girl Scout camps formed near Bonnie Brae, one called Dyerbrook and the other was Edith Sinnett; these were day camps for younger girls. In July 1940 the camp got electricity from the Pittsfield Electric Company, most of the structures were built and a new artesian well was dug. The fee was $5.00 per week. A new unit, Enchanted Forest, was established, with its own base a mile hike from the camp. There were 397 campers that year. In 1941 the state granted the Peck Lumber Company access to the forests; this company logged 200 acres (the lumbering continued until 1962). Eleanor Roosevelt came and toured the camp this season, telling girls to “develop a seeing eye and an inquiring mind”, and she placed the camp on the International Girl Scout Camp list. During the 2nd Western Hemisphere Encampment in the same year, scouts from across the United States and more than 14 other countries exchanged recipes, camping ideas, customs and costumes. After her visit, Mrs. Roosevelt penned a special essay for her column “My Day”. In 1945, there were 485 campers. A year later, the camp had a horse program from John Simpson of Hartford, with 6 horses, a truck and some grain and hay that cost $760. In 1948, the campers went on lots of biking trips. A camp improvement was the installation of an infirmary, which was dedicated with a special program. Included in the Infirmary dedication August 15, 1948 is the philosophical statement that \\"Loyalty and honor go hand in hand. One of these without the other would fade and our inner qualities would loose their fine touch, in many ways less tangible than games, these qualities are being put to practice when Girl Scouts honor foremost one's self, and then school, camp and ideas.\\" In 1949, a new dishwashing system was developed with advice from the Cornell School of Home Economics. By this time, In the late 1940s, the original inn burned down and was replaced by a building called Big House. The Big House held the camp store, art area and offices. During the year of 1950, the Enchanted Forest became a unit for the oldest regular campers. Other units included Tanglewood, Jungle, Camelot, Wahpeton, and Sherwood. The campers earned special camp letters and awards by doing activities and quests. Braids were established as the official camp hair-do, and if you did not behave, your supper would be destined to be prunes! Scouts would compete to see who would get the most clams out of Big pond. Since clams were only found in the deep end of the swimming area, you had to swim under the water and grab one. Their sport field program included: track, golf, tennis, basketball, volleyball and baseball. Even then, families were told not to send in radios with their campers. In 1953, there were 506 campers. In the summer of 1955, the camp program included sail-boating, a brand new activity. Sailboats were purchased and were in use through 1956. This camp unit was Lochmar, a sailing unit for younger Girl Scouts. There were also Anchorage and Birnam Wood. Tyro was originally the counselor training unit, until Green Horizons took its place. Other continuing units were Sherwood, Viking Dalen and Enchanted Forest. The newspaper changed to The Bonnie Brae Bugle as well. Over time the Springfield Girl Scouts Became the Pioneer Valley Girl Scouts with Chicopee, Agawam, East Longmeadow, Longmeadow, Hampton, Monson, Wilberham, Palmer, Ware, Belchertown and Ludlow troops. In 1960, the camp was run by the Pioneer Valley Girl Scout Council, Inc. Girls went on Quests and got special badges. Here is an example of a quest: 1. Find a spider's web. 2. Catch a fly and put it in the web. 3. Watch what the spider does, then tell about it. 4. Find which part of the web is sticky and which isn't. In 1968, the units changed back to age-based levels. In that year, Camp Bonnie Brae occupied 250 acres of land and had 120 campers. The oldest training unit is the counselor training unit.

And as the Vagabond King in 1930 and again in 1956 Plot François Villon is a poet and avid patriot whose father was burned at the stake. François is particularly committed to helping the oppressed and the weak. The Duke of Burgundy is out for the French throne. With cunning and deceit he tries to deceive the superstitious king, who is warned by his astrologers about a war with Burgundy. So the king also gives in to the demand that his ward Charlotte marry the Burgundian Count Thibault d'Aussigny. On \\"Day of Fools\\" François is elected King of Fools by the population. The citizens protest against the living conditions. The Duke wants to end the uprising, but is offended by François. King Ludwig, fearing an affront to the duke, banishes François from Paris. With some friends, François steals a wagon with food that the Duke has sent to the King. They use a catapult to transport food into town to care for the poor. François is accidentally catapulted into the city. It ends up in Charlotte's room, who is waiting there with her groom for the wedding to begin. The count pursues the surprised poet. A battle ensues in which François defeats Thibault. Charlotte decides to run away with the poet. But François is captured and Charlotte surrenders to her fate. François is brought to Burgundy, tortured and, as a special wedding surprise, locked in a cage.

Built in 1907, the Romanesque Revival style building is currently a branch of the Nevada County Library System.http://mynevadacounty.com/library/ . accessed 8/22/2010 History With beginnings as an 1849 mining town, Nevada City had a reading room as early as 1850. Becoming a settlement, it boasted a library association in less than a decade, followed by a YMCA reading room and library in 1869. Ownership of an Odd Fellows Library that was established 1874, was transferred to the city in 1902, and the library was moved to the Corcoran Building next to the historic Nevada Theatre. The women of Nevada City urged the library trustees to seek Carnegie funds, and, in 1904, the trustees received a grant for $10,000. Bids were opened the following year, and the estimated completion date of a new library was 1906. As the library committee believed it might receive an additional $5,000 from Carnegie, plans were made for a more elaborate building, but on October 13, 1905, the trustees were notified there would be no additional funding, necessitating changes to the plans. William H. Weeks was the architect, while Watsonville's W.J. Wilkerson of Graniterock was the builder. Organized as the Civic Improvement Club, the city's women were the landscape planners. Furnishings cost $1,000. The library was dedicated on October 4, 1907. Miss Annie James was the librarian in 1919. By 1923, the Nevada City Free Library had 1,782 volumes, increasing to 7,555 volumes by 1927, when Iva Williamson was the librarian. = Landmark = Situated in a historic Carnegie library building, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1990. Another Carnegie library and NRHP, Grass Valley's Royce Library, is in the neighboring town. The Foley is located at 211 North Pine Street, on the southwest corner of Pine and York streets, across from the Nevada County Court House. It is situated on a steeply sloping lot, by , purchased by the city from the county at a cost of $700. Architecture The building was designed in a Romanesque Revival architectural style by Weeks, the architect of several other Northern California Carnegie libraries. The seven room, single story plus basement building was constructed by Wilkerson using dark gray man-made stone, plus both rough and smooth concrete blocks, fabricated on location. It features a dark brick facade, now painted white, and a partially exposed cement foundation. A cement stairway leads from the road to the arched doorways. Two arched windows are situated in the foyer, the side one being smaller, and the larger front one being of stained glass depicting the lamp of knowledge. There are numerous other windows, rectangular in shape. The interior has not changed much in layout. It includes a black and white checkered floor. LibraryGold Rush reference library= After the Madelyn Helling Library was built in the Nevada County's Rood Administrative Center in the late 1990s, the Carnegie library became a research and reference library for local history and the California Gold Rush. On May 17, 1997, it was renamed the Doris Foley Library for Historical Research in honor of local teacher, historian and writer, Doris Foley, the wife of a gold-mining engineer.http://mynevadacounty.com/library/index.cfm?ccs=603&cs;=432 . accessed 8/22/2010 Signage There are several signs and plaques on the outside of the building noting the library's various names: * \\"Public Library\\": large, block letters above the front door; part of the original design. * \\"Doris Foley Library for Historical Research\\": lettering on the glass of the front door. * \\"Nevada County Library, Local History Research Center, National Register of Historic Places, December 10, 1990\\": plaque to the right of the front door * \\"Nevada City Public Library\\": plaque to the left of the front door. In total, it states: Library Association formed December 19, 1857. First library was in Kidd-Knox Bldg. 228 Broad St. It was moved to Oustomah Lodge I.O.O.F. No. 16, June 3, 1874. Nevada City Trustees assumed responsibilities Oct. 1, 1902 and was moved into the Corcoran Bldg. next to the Nevada Theatre. The Carnegie Endowment was given to the city in 1904. The present library was dedicated Oct. 4, 1907. City groups raised funds for furnishings and beautified grounds 1911. =Materials= Book capacity is 8,000, and the current automation system is Horizon. There are maps and records dating back to 1856, a Genealogy Room and an Assessor's Books area. In October 2003, the library received the Arthur Cecil Todd Cornish Studies Collection, named in honor of Dr. Todd, author of The Cornish Miner in America: The Contribution to the Mining History of the United States by Emigrant Cornish Miners--The Men Called Cousin Jacks. Friends of the Library Though the Foley was in jeopardy of closing in July 2009 because of county budget cuts, financial support from the Friends of the Library allows it to remain open to the public Thursday, Friday and Saturday 10am-4pm.

In 1958, the model received a major change when it was introduced as a doublecut model instead of the traditional singlecut. In 1961, the Les Paul received a drastic change when it was formed into what we know today as the Gibson SG. the Les Paul submodels changed with it. In 1968, when the contract was renewed, the original models were rebooted, and Gibson and Gibson Custom Shop now offer a total of four Les Paul special models: two single cut and two double cut.http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Les-Paul/Gibson- Custom/1960-Les-Paul-Special-Double-VOS.aspx.

OpenCog Prime is an architecture for robot and virtual embodied cognition that defines a set of interacting components designed to give rise to human-equivalent artificial general intelligence (AGI) as an emergent phenomenon of the whole system. OpenCog Prime's design is primarily the work of Ben Goertzel while the OpenCog framework is intended as a generic framework for broad-based AGI research. Research utilizing OpenCog has been published in journals and presented at conferences and workshops including the annual Conference on Artificial General Intelligence. OpenCog is released under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License. OpenCog is in use by more than 50 companies, including Huawei and Cisco.  Origin  OpenCog was originally based on the release in 2008 of the source code of the proprietary \\"Novamente Cognition Engine\\" (NCE) of Novamente LLC. The original NCE code is discussed in the PLN book (ref below). Ongoing development of OpenCog is supported by Artificial General Intelligence Research Institute (AGIRI), the Google Summer of Code project, Hanson Robotics, SingularityNET and others.  Components  OpenCog consists of: * A graph database, dubbed the AtomSpace, that holds \\"atoms\\" (that is, terms, atomic formulas, sentences and relationships) together with their \\"values\\" (valuations or interpretations, which can be thought of as per-atom key-value databases). An example of a value would be a truth value. Atoms are globally unique, immutable and are indexed (searchable); values are fleeting and changeable. * A collection of pre- defined atoms, termed Atomese, used for generic knowledge representation, such as conceptual graphs and semantic networks, as well as to represent and store the rules (in the sense of term rewriting) needed to manipulate such graphs. * A collection of pre-defined atoms, that encode a type subsystem, including type constructors and function types. These are used to specify the types of variables, terms and expressions, and are used to specify the structure of generic graphs containing variables. * A collection of pre-defined atoms that encode both functional and imperative programming styles. These include the lambda abstraction for binding free variables into bound variables, as well as for performing beta reduction. * A collection of pre-defined atoms that encode a satisfiability modulo theories solver, built in as a part of a generic graph query engine, for performing graph and hypergraph pattern matching (isomorphic subgraph discovery). This generalizes the idea of a structured query language (SQL) to the domain of generic graphical queries; it is an extended form of a graph query language. * A generic rule engine, including a forward chainer and a backward chainer, that is able to chain together rules. The rules are exactly the graph queries of the graph query subsystem, and so the rule engine vaguely resembles a query planner. It is designed so as to allow different kinds of inference engines and reasoning systems to be implemented, such as Bayesian inference or fuzzy logic, or practical tasks, such as constraint solvers or motion planners. * An attention allocation subsystem based on economic theory, termed ECAN. This subsystem is used to control the combinatorial explosion of search possibilities that are met during inference and chaining. * An implementation of a probabilistic reasoning engine based on probabilistic logic networks (PLN). The current implementation uses the rule engine to chain together specific rules of logical inference (such as modus ponens), together with some very specific mathematical formulas assigning a probability and a confidence to each deduction. This subsystem can be thought of as a certain kind of proof assistant that works with a modified form of Bayesian inference. * A probabilistic genetic program evolver called Meta- Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search, or MOSES. This is used to discover collections of short Atomese programs that accomplish tasks; these can be thought of as performing a kind of decision tree learning, resulting in a kind of decision forest, or rather, a generalization thereof. * A natural language input system consisting of Link Grammar, and partly inspired by both Meaning- Text Theory as well as Dick Hudson's Word Grammar, which encodes semantic and syntactic relations in Atomese. * A natural language generation system . * An implementation of Psi-Theory for handling emotional states, drives and urges, dubbed OpenPsi. * Interfaces to Hanson Robotics robots, including emotion modelling via OpenPsi. This includes the Loving AI project, used to demonstrate meditation techniques.  Organization and funding  In 2008, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), formerly called Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), sponsored several researchers and engineers. Many contributions from the open source community have been made since OpenCog's involvement in the Google Summer of Code in 2008 and 2009. Currently MIRI no longer supports OpenCog. OpenCog has received funding and support from several sources, including the Hong Kong government, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation and Hanson Robotics. The OpenCog project is currently affiliated with SingularityNET and Hanson Robotics. Applications Similar to other cognitive architectures, the main purpose is to create virtual humans, which are three dimensional avatar characters. The goal is to mimicry behaviors like emotions, gestures and learning. For example, the emotion module in the software was only programmed, because humans have emotions. Artificial General Intelligence can be realized, if it simulates intelligence of humans. The self-description of the OpenCog project provides additional possible applications which are going into the direction of natural language processing and the simulation of a dog.

Y Foryd, also known as Foryd Bay, is a tidal bay in Gwynedd, Wales. It is located at the south-western end of the Menai Strait, about two miles south-west of Caernarfon. Several rivers flow into the bay and there are large areas of mudflats and salt marsh. A shingle spit partly blocks the mouth of the bay. At the north-western end is Fort Belan, built during the 18th century. Aerial photography in the drought of 2018 identified rectangular structures possibly of Roman age, at Glan y Mor, on slightly raised ground adjacent to the shoreline. This layout is very unusual in Roman Wales; it is rectilinear but has no defences and is otherwise unlike the military Roman sites in Wales, nor does it resemble the native defended settlements with their roundhouses and irregular outlines, nor the occasional villas. It is similar to the buildings and ditched enclosures excavated on the other side of the Menai Strait at Tai Cochion. To the south is a rectangular ditched structure or possible building, with an internal subdivision, measuring 25 by 13 m. To the north is a pair of almost identical structures; both groups are linked by a linear ditch or boundary. Close by, an early field system runs north-west–south-east between Plas Farm and the shores of the Menai Strait; the fields are rectangular, with at least one visible ditched hollow way.Driver, T., Burnham, B., & Davies, J.

It is situated on Koteshwar Road, Near Vinay Nagar sector-1, is around 7 km from the Gwalior Railway station. The land was purchased by Huzur Malik Saheb Sant Yogi ManSingh ji in 1961 for the sum of Rs. 12,000 /- in order to establish an ashram. When Swami Vishnu Tirth Ji Maharaj visited Gwalior on 11 April 1961, the place was inaugurated and named 'Adhyatma Niketan'. It is spread over of land at the foot-hill of Gwalior Fort. The rear part of Adhyatma Niketan is used as a residence by Sant Kripal Singh Ji Maharaj, and his family members and the front part is donated to the trust called 'Adhyatmic Shikshan and Sadhana Kendra'. The Ashram has one big and spacious auditorium which is used for satsang, spiritual discourses, bhajan, kundalini awakening and shaktipat initiation http://adhyatmajyoti.org/present_ashrams.html etc., especially on the occasions of the Ashram's various festivals, when a large number of devotees gather there. On the eastern side lies the samadhin of Huzur Malik Saheb. The samadhi has sufficient space inside to accommodate around 200-250 devotees at a time for worship and meditation. Various kinds of stones including white marble have been used. Satsang at Adhyatma Niketan Satsang at Adhyatma Niketan has assumed the greatest significance. It is understood that the disciple or sadhaka gains maximum spiritual benefit through satsang with the least effort. The Satsang at Adhyatma Niketan is practised in three parts. First in the morning with the dawn, the recitation of DHUN is practiced. DHUN is a continuous recitation of mantras. After that, nearly about 11.00 AM, the morning satsang starts. This continues for nearly three hours, in which the disciples practice meditation, bhajans (devotional songs) and ask the queries to the maharajji. In evening after sunset, 7.00 PM the evening satsang starts. This continues for nearly two hours.

He is known for his shared performances in a two and a half-year run as the star role of 'Billy' in Billy Elliot the Musical at London's Victoria Palace Theatre. He has appeared as Mobbsy in the 26 episode live action children's comedy series My Phone Genie on ITV and CITV. Career Jackson-Keen has appeared in a wide range of advertising campaigns and TV shows, and competed four times in the UK National Gymnastics finals. He received the first name of \\"Fox\\" because his father was a fan of the TV's The X Files. His father was a gymnast, and in initially followed in his father's footsteps, Fox entered and won several youth competitions before representing London in a national competition, where he came third. At 9-years-old in 2006, he started break-dancing and hip-hop, and then studied ballet and tap. His broadcast career began in 2006 with a role in the UK television series The Bill, and in the award-winning film Terry Pratchett's Hogfather. From June 2008 to March 2010 Jackson-Keen played the role of Billy in Billy Elliot the Musical in London. When cast at 12½ years old, he became the 16th boy to play that role. His 23 June 2008 debut marked the first Londoner to play that role. At 14½ years old, and after 205 performances, he retired from the role of Billy on 27 March 2010 as the oldest of the 'Billys'.

The painting was painted around the same time as the better-known Girl with a Pearl Earring, and has a near-identical size. Because of this, and its proximity in tone and composition, it is sometimes considered to be either a variant or pendant painting (counterpart) of Girl with a Pearl Earring. The subjects of both paintings wear pearl earrings, have scarves draped over their shoulders, and are shown in front of a plain black background. In addition, it is likely that the creation of both works involved the use of some optical device, such as a camera obscura or mirror, as the Hockney–Falco thesis speculates. Description The sitter is depicted as having a homely face—widely spaced and flat—with a small nose and thin lips. The lack of idealised beauty has led to a general belief that this work was painted on commission, although it is possible that the model was Vermeer's daughter. The artist probably used a live model but, as with Girl with a Pearl Earring, did not create the work as a portrait, but as a tronie, a Dutch word meaning \\"visage\\" or \\"expression\\", a type of Dutch 17th-century picture appreciated for its \\"unusual costumes, intriguing physiognomies, suggestion of personality, and demonstration of artistic skill\\". The picture encourages the viewer to be curious about the young woman's thoughts, feelings, or character, something typical in many of Vermeer's paintings. Girl with a Pearl Earring and Portrait of a Young Woman are unusual for Vermeer in that they lack his usual rich background; instead the girls are framed by a background of deep black. This isolating effect seems to heighten their vulnerability and seeming desire to place trust in the viewer. In 1994, the art historian Edward Snow wrote that Portrait of a Young Woman conveys \\"the desire for beauty and perfection into a loving acceptance of what is flawed\\". Provenance and exhibitions The painting may have been owned by Pieter Claesz van Ruijven of Delft before 1674, then by his widow, Maria de Knuijt of Delft, until 1681; then their daughter, Magdalena van Ruijven, until 1682; her widower, Jacob Dissius, until 1695. The painting is thought to have been part of the Dissius sale of May 16, 1696 (No. 38, 39 or 40). It probably then belonged to Dr. Luchtmans, who sold it in Rotterdam as part of a sale from April 20–22, 1816 (No. 92) for 3 Dutch guilders (about 30 grams of silver), even then a tiny amount.Reitlinger, Gerald; The Economics of Taste, Vol I: The Rise and Fall of Picture Prices 1760–1960. 484. Barrie and Rockliffe, London, 1961 Prince Auguste Marie Raymond d'Arenberg, of Brussels, owned the painting by 1829, and it remained in his family, in Brussels and Schloss Meppen, from 1833 to the early 1950s. In 1959 (or 1955, according to another source), it was bought in a private sale from the Prince d'Arenberg by Mr. Charles Wrightsman and Mrs. Jayne Wrightsman of New York for a sum estimated at around £125,000. In 1979, the Wrightsmans donated the picture to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in memory of curator Theodore Rousseau, Jr. ReferencesSources   Further reading * External links *Study of a Young Woman at the website of the Metropolitan Museum of Art *The Milkmaid by Johannes Vermeer, exhibition catalog fully online as PDF from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which contains material on Portrait of a Young Woman (cat. no. 9) *Notable acquisitions 1979–1980, fully digitized online as PDF from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which contains material on Portrait of a Young Woman (pp. 41–42) Category:Paintings by Johannes Vermeer Category:1660s paintings Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Young Woman (Vermeer) ","title":"Study of a Young Woman"},{"id":"22837921","text":"Shadow of the Scorpion is a novel by Neal Asher, published by the Macmillan Publishers imprint Tor Books in 2008.

Within ESA, SPICA was part of the Medium Class-5 (M5) mission competition, with a cost cap of 550M Euros. It stopped being a candidate for M5 in October 2020 due to financial constraints.  Overview  The concept was a collaboration between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). If funded, the telescope would be launched on JAXA's H3 launch vehicle. The Ritchey–Chrétien telescope's 2.5-metre mirror (similar size to that of the Herschel Space Observatory) would be made of silicon carbide, possibly by ESA given their experience with the Herschel telescope. The main mission of the spacecraft would be the study of star and planetary formation. It would be able to detect stellar nurseries in galaxies, protoplanetary discs around young stars, and exoplanets, helped by its own coronograph for the latter two types of objects.  Description  The observatory would feature a far-infrared spectrometer and is proposed to be deployed in a halo orbit around the L2 point.

It took place near Roberts Farm, Tooreen, near Ballinhassig in County Cork. The IRA ambushed two lorries of British soldiers, killing three and wounding four. The British surrendered and their weapons and ammunition were seized by the IRA. Later that night, British soldiers went on a rampage in nearby Bandon. Background Up until the ambush the 3rd Cork Brigade had not before engaged the British troops stationed in County Cork in a proper battle. The Brigade had finished its training and to get it ready for combat it had to get in an engagement with the British soldiers. The Essex Regiment of the British Army was deployed to West Cork and had a reputation for violently raiding the houses throughout the countryside and arresting people believed to be IRA volunteers. They were also known to torture their prisoners in order to get information on the whereabouts of the flying columns, so this made them a despised enemy to the West Cork IRA (possible but unsubstantiated). The Essex were known to travel on the road from Bandon to Cork City every morning and return in the evenings. The road went through the hamlet of Toureen which the Third West Cork Brigade was stationed at nearby and it was decided to ambush this column of the Essex Regiment as it made its way to Cork City. Ambush Thirty-two ambushers, twenty-one being riflemen of the Third West Cork Brigade occupied ambush positions outside Toureen and lay in wait for the approaching Essex. The Essex normally went in two or three lorries to Cork City so the IRA placed a home-made mine on the road for use against them. Scouts signalled the approach of two lorries which were coming down the road towards the ambush site. As the first lorry passed, the order to fire was given and a home-made three-pound bomb was thrown. The bomb landed inside the lorry but did not explode. The mine that was placed on the road also failed to detonate. As the volunteers opened fire, the second lorry stopped and the soldiers inside leaped out and returned fire, but the volunteers were hidden behind a large timber gate which gave them cover. The first lorry sped on to Cork Barracks and the men were found guilty of shameful desertion for not assisting the men in the second lorry (no evidence for this statement - at the inquest it was stated that this was as orders required). As the fight went on, the officer in command of the British troops, Captain Dixon, was shot in the head and killed as well as one of his men. The British surrendered soon after and the IRA men ceased firing. The British were relieved of their weapons and ammunition, but otherwise unharmed. Fourteen rifles, bayonets, equipment, several Mills bombs, around 1,400 rounds of ammunition and a couple of revolvers were taken from them. Aftermath Two soldiers Lt Dixon MC, Suffolk Regt. and Pte Charles William Reid, Essex Regt. were killed in the ambush. Five were wounded, including Sergeant Thomas Bennett RASC died next day in Cork. Six were unhurt except for shock. None of the IRA volunteers were killed or wounded during the ambush and aid was given to the wounded soldiers, while the dead were pulled away from the lorry and it was then set on fire by the volunteers. The two soldiers who were not hurt during the ambush were released along with their wounded and they returned to their barracks. Location - farm wall 2014 Later that night, the Essex went on a violent rampage through Bandon, destroying property and seeking out anyone they believed to be connected to the ambush. It is believed that at least some of the rampaging soldiers were those released unharmed by the IRA earlier in the day. (no evidence for this statement).

Sometimes article directories are referred to as content farms, which are websites created to produce mass content, where some are based on churnalism. An article directory may accept new articles from any contributor, but may require that a new article is unique (not published elsewhere) and not spun (see article spinning). A typical article is around 400-500 words, and tools such as a WYSIWYG editor for writing and submitting an article may be provided. An author box may be provided for personal information about an author, including a link to the author's website. Tags or categories may be used to organize articles and to help with search engines since tags or categories act as keywords that identify the topics covered in the article. Many directories pay the author for his/her participation. Some directories review articles before they are published and there may be a waiting period of several days before a new article appears. This helps to eliminate low quality submissions, including duplicate articles, spam and spun articles.  Submitting articles for SEO  Article directories allow users to submit unique articles to the directory for content syndication. These directories allow articles to embed links to other websites with relevant anchor text. Popular article directories are considered authority sites and are constantly crawled by search engine bots. Webmasters submit articles with relevant anchor text linking back to their site to obtain backlinks. Beginning with the Google Penguin release on April 24, 2012, Google began to punish sites that obtained links from article directories.

Before he joined Accept, Tornillo was in the group T.T. Quick. The band arose from the fertile club scene in Tornillo's native New Jersey and picked up enough of a following to successfully tour across the state as well as play in New York. His vocals appeared on multiple releases by the band in the 1980s and 1990s. Although T.T.

In a review for Blind Rage, music critic Gregory Heaney remarked that \\"with Tornillo on vocals, Accept still sound the way you remember them sounding when they were at the height of their power\\". He concluded that \\"even the lapsed, Balls to the Wall-era metalheads out there will feel as though they're picking up with the band right where they left off.\\" Tornillo talked about how he came to join the band, saying it was \\"just a freak thing\\". He also said that he was a fan of Accept prior to joining, \\"I was a fan back in the '80s, in the early days. TT Quick covered Accept songs before we had a record deal. I actually turned a lot of people on to Accept. We would cover 'Son Of A Bitch' and 'Flash Rockin' Man'. People would say, 'What is that?' 'That's original stuff that we wrote.' 'No! [Laughs] That's a German band called Accept.' But yes, I was a fan by all means. Still am.\\" He then said that he was nervous as being Udo Dirkschneider's replacement, \\"I was extremely nervous, especially due to the Internet because the Internet, you know what everyone's thinking right away. It's not like the '80s or the old days where you never got to hear what the audience thought. You just read the magazines and so did they and that was it. Now, with the Internet it was quite obvious that people were not happy with this decision, so I was, like ,'Uh…okay! Here we go. It's on.' That's why we decided right off the bat that we would go in and record, try and make the best possible album we could make, which was 'Blood Of The Nations'. Instead of just going out and resting on the laurels and playing their old material, we had to be a viable, new band. And we tried our damnest to be and I think it's working. 'Blood Of The Nations' surprised a lot of people and I felt a whole lot better after that came out, for certain.

Recognized as one of the industry's most successful hobbyists, his 1970 film Multiple SIDosis is one of the few amateur films to have been selected for inclusion in the National Film Registry. Biography Laverents was born on August 5, 1908 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and moved frequently with his family as his father was a real estate speculator always trying to find the next opportunity, ultimately attending high school in Florida. He learned to play piano from his mother, took drum lessons, and was self-taught on banjo, harmonica and the ukulele. He figured out how to play a woodblock with a string and cymbals with his elbows while playing the banjo or ukulele, and left to become a traveling musician after meeting an act that had performed at a theater his father owned. During the Great Depression, Laverents made a living as a one-man band appearing in vaudeville shows.Weber, Bruce. \\"Sid Laverents Dies, Auteur of Homemade Films, Dies at 100\\", The New York Times, May 16, 2009. Accessed May 17, 2009. He was employed as a sheet metal worker at Consolidated Aircraft in San Diego, California starting in 1941, and with the exception of military service remained with the firm until 1967, by which time it had become part of Convair. During World War II, he was assigned to repair aircraft in Calcutta for the United States Army Air Forces and he later studied engineering at San Diego State College. After leaving Convair, he worked for Hughes Tool Company until his retirement in 1972. =Filmmaking= He started making films in 1958 as part of the San Diego Amateur Moviemakers Club using a 16-millimeter Bolex camera.McLellan, Dennis. \\"Sidney Laverents dies at 100; amateur filmmaker celebrated for his humor, technical skill\\", Los Angeles Times, May 13, 2009. Accessed May 17, 2009. The 20 films he made during his second half-century included nature films such as Snails and How They Walk about snails in his backyard that included a snail race with hand-painted numbers on their shells, as well as It Sudses and Sudses and Sudses, a comedy about shaving cream cans gone crazy. A three-part biography, The Sid Saga, was finished while he was in his 80s. Laverents was best known for Multiple SIDosis, a nine-minute film that features multiple images of himself playing various instruments to the tune of the Felix Arndt song Nola. The film, which took four years to complete, begins with Laverents opening a Christmas present of tape recorder from his third wife, Adelaide, which he uses to play the song accompanying himself by humming, whistling and playing many of the instruments he had used in his one-man band. With the technology available at the time, he added the additional images of himself by re-exposing the film multiple times to include 11 images of himself using custom-designed equipment that he had developed to ensure that the sound and images were synchronized during the re-recordings. The multiple re-exposures meant that an error on any of the dozen images would require starting from scratch. At the age of 92, in the year 2000, the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress selected Multiple SIDosis for preservation as part of the National Film Registry, making it one of the small number of amateur films included, joining the unscripted Zapruder film of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Stephen Leggett of the National Film Preservation Board described the film as \\"technically quite adept and inventive, amusingly droll and quite mesmerizing to those who see it\\" and noted that it was chosen to \\"honor all the many terrific films produced by amateur ciné club filmmakers throughout the U.S. over the years\\". =Personal= Sid became a member of MENSA later in his life, after reading an article about it in the Reader's Digest, and remembering that an IQ test given to him in the 1940s for a job in the defense industry was the highest recorded. In addition to his films, Laverents wrote two books; His autobiography, The First 90 Years Are the Hardest and the novel Raging Waters about a devastating 1929 flood in Elba, Alabama. Worried that his health might prevent him from attending a party celebrating his 100th birthday, he prepared an apology video in advance, but was ultimately able to attend. Laverents lived in Bonita, California, and died at age 100 on May 6, 2009 in Chula Vista, California due to pneumonia. He was married four times; his first two marriages ended in divorce, and then he was widowed once. He was survived by his fourth wife, Charlotte, whom he married in 1991.

Sarre was an early supporter of Jean-Pierre Chevènement and François Mitterrand within the new Socialist Party (PS), which he joined at the famous Epinay Congress in 1971. He was the Socialist top candidate in the 1977 Paris municipal election but lost the election by a handful of votes to Jacques Chirac. He was elected MEP in the 1979 European elections and was elected to the French National Assembly for Paris in 1981. Between 1988 and 1993 he served as Secretary of State for Road and Fluvial Transportation in the governments led by Michel Rocard, Édith Cresson and Pierre Bérégovoy. He later served, between 1995 and 2008 as the Mayor of the 11th arrondissement of Paris. In the left's 1993 debacle, he was re-elected in Paris' 6th constituency, the only constituency not won by the right in that election. That same year, disagreeing with the Socialist Party's neo-liberal derive, he joined Jean-Pierre Chevènement in creating the Citizens' Movement (MDC). The MDC became the Republican Pole in 2002 before adopting its current name, Citizen and Republican Movement (MRC). He supported Chevènement's candidacy in the 2002 presidential election and prepared a second Chevènement candidacy in the 2007 presidential election, but Chevènement did not run, instead supporting the Socialist candidate Ségolène Royal by the first round. He was defeated in his constituency by the Socialist Danièle Hoffman-Rispal in the 2002 French legislative election. However, ahead of the 2007 presidential election and 2007 legislative election in which the MRC supported Royal's candidacy in return for the Socialist Party's endorsement of Sarre's candidacy in the Creuse's 2nd constituency in the June legislative election. Despite the lack of PS opposition, he lost the runoff to UMP incumbent Jean Auclair. He was often considered the co-leader of the MRC along with Chevènement, although Chevènement is currently the MRC's President.

He is perhaps best known for his membership as a guitarist in the heavy metal band London and for co-writing the Mötley Crüe song \\"Public Enemy #1\\". From 1990 until his death in 2019, he performed with the glam rock band Spiders & Snakes. Career He was the guitarist for the band Sister with Blackie Lawless and Nikki Sixx in the mid-to-late 1970s. Thereafter he formed the band London with Nikki Sixx, drummer Dane Rage, keyboardist John St. John, and vocalist Henri Valentine, who was later replaced by Nigel Benjamin, formerly of Mott. The band garnered a following of glam rock fans from the late 1970s, spearheaded by Rodney Bingenheimer and Kim Fowley. Differences arose between Nikki Sixx and Nigel Benjamin, and the band finally broke up. Grey and fellow London member Dane Rage went on to form the band Roxy Roller with female Canadian vocalist Leslie Knauer, also known from the bands Promises and Precious Metal, and Randy St. Clair. Roxy Roller, a \\"glitter pop\\" band released one single, a cover of Cole Porter's song \\"Anything Goes\\". Shortly afterward there was a revision of the band London featuring vocalist Nadir D'Priest, which recorded internationally recognized albums and was featured in the movie The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years. This version of London continued until the late 1980s, when Lizzie decided to take over his own lead vocals, forming the band Ultra Pop which was heavily influenced by the band T-Rex, with Vince Votel, Ernie Machado, and Chris Solberg. Ultra Pop changed its name to Spiders & Snakes in 1990 with the addition of drummer Timothy Jay. Spiders & Snakes made several recordings beginning in the 1990s. In 2000, just after the release of the album London Daze, bassist Leigh Lawson died. During this brief split in the band membership, Lizzie explored musical endeavors with various bands in Arizona before returning to Los Angeles to carry on the legacy of Spiders & Snakes, until his retirement in 2017, where the band remains to this day, with current members Chris Sheridan, Phil St. Vincent and Timothy Jay. Personal life Grey's maternal uncle was radio commentator Wally George, and he was the cousin of actress Rebecca De Mornay.

The mill was one of Europe's largest, but in 2009 was reported to be on the brink of closure.

Thames & Hudson. , She was born in Crowborough, Sussex, daughter of a naval officer, Steriker Finnis, and gardener Constance Finnis. She attended Hayes Court school in Kent and Downe House school in Berkshire. In 1968 she met retired diplomat and plantsman David Scott whom she married in 1970 and with whom she lived, gardening together until his death in 1986. In 1990 she set up the Merlin Trust, named after David Scott's son Merlin who was killed in the second world war, aged 22. The Merlin Trust assists young horticulturists to travel and gain experience. After her death in 2006, the Finnis Scott Foundation was established to provide supportive funding to artistic, art historical, horticultural or botanical projects. Waterperry For 28 years Valerie Finnis was associated with Waterperry Horticultural School for Women, at Waterperry House, situated just outside Oxford. She first went to Waterperry in 1942, aged 18, at which time it was run by Beatrix Havergal, and helped make it a famous horticultural institution. While teaching at Waterperry, she became noted for her expertise in alpine plants, propagating 50,000 plants a year in the school's greenhouses. Among her work as a plant breeder, she developed a cross between an \\"orange-peel\\" clematis (C. orientalis and C. tangutica) she named for Bill MacKenzie. Influences BBC personality Carol Klein reports Finnis encouraging her work. The plant Artemisia ludoviciana 'Valerie Finnis' is named after Finnis. It was given to her by Wilhelm Schacht of Munich Botanic Garden in 1949 (wrongly as A. borealis). Another artemisia, Artemisia stelleriana 'Boughton Silver' is named after her garden at Boughton House Northamptonshire. This plant originally known as 'Mori's form' was given to her on her honeymoon in Japan in 1970 by Mr Mori. It has been renamed 'Silver Brocade' in Canada.

It is adjacent to the Wedge Plantation and just south of Fairfield Plantation. The plantation house was built around 1807. It is located off US Highway 17 near the Santee River. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on September 18, 1975. History The house at Harrietta Plantation was built by Mrs. Harriot Horry of the Hampton Plantation for her daughter, Harriott and her husband Frederick Rutledge. Mrs. Horry's son, Charles Lucas Pinckney Horry, married Elenore Marie Florimonde de Fay la Tour Maubourg. When Charles and Elemore decided to live elsewhere, Frederick and Harriot Rutledge lived at Hampton Plantation, and work on the Harrietta Plantation House stopped. In 1858, the house was purchased by Stephen D. Doar. He finished the upper floors and was the first resident in the house. The Doar family owned the house until 1929. Rice was cultivated until 1903. When the house was sold in 1929, there were rooms in the house that had yet to be plastered. In 1929, Mr. Doar sold the plantation to Mr. Horatio Shonnard of New York, who undertook a restoration of the house and its gardens. In March 1947, the 17-room plantation and its 1500 acres were sold by Mrs. Horatio Shonnard to Mrs. John P. Abney, the widow of the founder of an eponymous chain of cotton mills in the Piedmont section of South Carolina. The plantation had been listed for sale for $115,000 at that time. The house is currently owned by the Harrietta Holdings, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company. Architecture South elevation showing the \\"triple\\" door with the false door in the middle The original house was constructed around 1807. This is a Georgian style, clapboard house on a raised basement. The first floor had two rooms with a rear hallway. Each of the rooms had a separate entrance door to the front porch. Because these doors were very close to each other, a false door was built between them. They were framed together to result in an architecturally pleasing facade. Both of these rooms have fireplaces with carved Federal mantels. The door frames and moldings are also in Federal style. The south facade has a portico supported by four Doric columns. The pediment has a semi-elliptical window. It is decorated with dentate molding. The south facade has single nine over nine lights on either side of the doors. Each wing has four nine over nine lights evenly spaced. In the second story, there are pairs of six over six lights to the left and right of the porch gable. The single-story wings were built in the 1930s. The east wing has two rooms with a fireplace. The west wing has three rooms. Two of these have fireplaces. The wings use a Greek Revival style for the mantels and woodwork. The rear hallway extends along the north side of each wing. A floor plan of the first floor with the wings has been published. Gardens There is a formal garden on the south side that extends to Collins Creek. To the east, there are old rice fields. To the north is a lake with cypress trees that is an old rice field. To the west is the entrance to the plantation, which was the old slave avenue. There is also the remains of a rice threshing mill and one slave cabin.

The title of the film was inspired by a newspaper article Morton had read about children in the foster care system. Morton spent time in other cities such as Newcastle, Glasgow and around London although decided it was best to make a film about the world she knew and grew up in. Originally wanting to set the film in 1989, Morton later decided against it as she wanted to focus on the struggles of the present day and not want audiences to write it off as a historical piece. Awards The film won Robert Carlyle a Scottish BAFTA for best TV actor in November 2009. On 10 May 2010 it was announced that the film had been nominated for 'Best Single Drama'; Lauren Socha was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

Rastus was \\"adopted\\" by Ty Cobb. Although Cobb denied being a racist, he was often perceived as hostile to blacks. When Cobb brought Rastus to Bennett Park during the 1908 season, the team performed well, and performed less well when it went on a road trip without Rastus. Rastus was proclaimed to be a good luck charm, and was taken on the next road trip. Rastus was temporarily dismissed from the Tigers' employ in September 1908. Rastus was then hired by the Chicago Cubs, the Tigers' World Series opponents, and was apparently good for their luck, as the Cubs won their second World Series that year. The chagrined Tigers hired Rastus back for 1909, and Rastus traveled with the team. He often had to hide under Cobb's bunk or in his room to evade Jim Crow laws that imposed racial segregation in hotels. Cobb took Rastus back to Georgia with him, as a caddie and servant, but eventually fired him. History Rastus, whose true name was Ulysses Harrison, was a homeless black youth whom Cobb took a liking to and began bringing to the ballpark. Cobb would rub the boy's head for good luck. Rastus gained a reputation for bringing good luck, especially when the Tigers, unaccompanied by Rastus, went on the road and did badly. With the Tigers' return home to Rastus and Bennett Park, their winning ways were restored. Rastus was booked to accompany them on the next road trip. In September 1909, Rastus was dismissed by the Tigers. Accounts differ as to why, whether small items were vanishing from the Tigers' locker room or because the team was again playing badly despite Rastus' magic. In any event, Rastus was picked up by the Chicago Cubs, who defeated the Tigers in five games. The Tigers restored Rastus to his position for the 1909 season. Rastus would hide amongst the players or hide in Cobb's room or under his berth to evade Jim Crow laws. At the end of the season, Cobb took Rastus home to Georgia, intending to make a manservant out of him. He was not successful.

The project's debut release, On This Perfect Day, was released in August 2009.  Biography  Background = In February 2009, Arjen announced in his website that he would be working on his new side project Guilt Machine. This project features a very limited line-up, comparing to other Arjen's side projects: Arjen Lucassen on the instruments and backing vocals, Jasper Steverlinck (Arid) on lead vocals, Chris Maitland (ex-Porcupine Tree) on drums and Lori Linstruth (ex-Stream of Passion) on lead guitar. On March 9, Arjen announced that fans would be able to submit their own recorded material for a possible inclusion on the project. The material had to be sent in the form of a brief audio message containing the person's thoughts in his/her mother language, with a translation. The deadline for submission was on March 15. Recently, Arjen has signed a deal with Mascot Records. Together with the announcement of the signing with Mascot Records at his official website, Arjen reported that more than 200 audio messages were sent, but only 19 would be included on the album. According to him, the languages range from Chinese to Tagalog and from French to Russian. He informed that the album will include an eight-minute instrumental track filled with as many messages as he could have used (although many recordings would still remain unused). = On This Perfect Day = On June 23, 2009, Lucassen announced the release of Guilt Machine's first release, On This Perfect Day. It was released on August 28 in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, on August 31 in the rest of Europe, September 29 in the US, and dates for Japan still pending. Most of the songs are relatively long, the shortest lasting 6:11. Limited and Special editions were released, the limited edition contained a 32-page digibook and a DVD and the special edition came with a Digipack 24-page booklet and a DVD. Regarding a future album of the project, Arjen stated in 2009 that \\"we definitely want to make another Guilt Machine album.\\". In a Q&A; in August 2018, he stated \\"I would love to do another Guilt Machine because I'm extremely proud of [On This Perfect Day] [...] Lori wrote the lyrics and she did an amazing job. I'd love to do another Guilt Machine but it would probably be with different people. Again, you know, not everyone is available anymore. But yeah, it's definitely an option. It's not a plan yet, but it's definitely an option.\\"  Musical style  According to Arjen, the music will range \\"from dark and heavy to atmospheric and melancholic\\". Regarding the concept, Arjen stated that instead of fantasy and science fiction themes, Guilt Machine will explore \\"the destructive psychology of guilt, regret and the darkest form of secret -- the secrets we hide from ourselves.\\" In spite of the differences, the songs are expected to keep the dynamic contrasts, intricated harmonies, complex rhythms and soaring melodies of any Ayreon release. Although Jasper and his band are from the alternative rock genre, he was convinced by Arjen to work on this progressive metal project. Arjen has stated: Instead of working with Ed Warby, the drummer that performed in most of Ayreon albums, Arjen chose Chris Maitland, which, according to him, \\"was the ideal choice this time, having both the power for the heavy sections and the subtle touch needed in the more atmospheric parts\\".

Tuxen was born in Kew, Victoria, on 11 December 1885. Surveying and town planning career Tuxen worked for his Danish born father's surveying firm in Melbourne, during the first decade of the twentieth century. After the death of his father in 1913, Saxil took over the surveying practice. The firm had forty years experience in the sub division of suburban land throughout Melbourne. Tuxen drew on this experience and developed an awareness of the intrinsic relationship between surveying and town planning. Tuxen \\"enjoyed success with conventional forms of design but he was also open to persuasion\\" and new ideas. His differing approaches to design and planning are evident in his 1914 \\"right-angled subdivision design in Bittern, Victoria\\". The Bittern design was based on a grid system plan. In contrast, his design for the ‘Hill Top’ development in Mont Albert, a suburb of Melbourne, incorporated \\"unusual size and shape, with an irregular streetscape\\". This example demonstrated Tuxen's movement away from the grid system, to the contemporary design approach of the early twentieth century. This new design embraced curved, radial and diagonal streets; the environment was celebrated through open spaces and parks, and civic buildings were placed in the centre of town. By the 1920s, Tuxen was as one of Australia's leading town planning experts. A plethora of planning knowledge and experience enabled Tuxen to become a founding member of the Victorian Town Planning Association. In 1923 Tuxen collaborated with the office of Walter Burley Griffin to design the Ranelagh Estate, on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. The estate had \\"distinctive long curved roads, recreation reserves, internal reserves, and spacious triangular traffic islands, which were designed to harmonise with the topography of the land\\". In 1925 Tuxen designed Park Orchards, in Melbourne. Between 1923 and 1929, Tuxen worked in a voluntary capacity for Melbourne's Metropolitan Town Planning Commission (MTPC) as a technical expert. His primary interests were Melbourne's waterways, roadways and public transport. Tuxen's primary focus was to ensure that Melbourne's tram networks were preserved and maintained, at a time when other planning experts were calling for them to be removed and to promote development which incorporated Melbourne's waterways, notable, the Yarra River. In 1925, during his association with the MTPC, Tuxen travelled to the US to gain further knowledge of contemporary technology and practice. He \\"photographed important urban features for potential incorporation into the future Melbourne [plan], paying particular attention to open spaces, streetscapes and building heights\\". By 1932, Saxil \\"had designed or co- designed at least thirty suburban divisions – a majority of which could be termed garden suburbs\\". In planning terms, Saxil is often overshadowed by better known contemporaries like John Sulman and architect/planner Walter Burley Griffin. However, Tuxen is the \\"most successful [garden city planner], where success is defined in terms of projects actually reaching completion in a form close to the original design\\". Ideas and influences Saxil Tuxen was exposed to a variety surveying and town planning theory and design through his international travels. He \\"was in touch with international developments, and utilised them where appropriate in his work\\". Saxil firmly believed that surveyors and town planners needed to work together if suburban subdivisions were to be successful. He felt that the values and expertise of the surveying profession facilitated Melbourne's plan, which incorporated a unique layout and an abundance of parklands. Tuxen's interest in the civic improvement of society and his passion for \\"planning\\" as a profession resulted in the widespread advancement of town planning throughout Australia. Saxil Tuxen was a \\"socially conscious [and] politically active planner [who had] interests in the built environment and social policy\\".

It is used to explain social and political behavior, as well as relationships involving abstract concepts. You can't keep squeezing a tube beyond a certain point to get any additional benefit, it's also used to describe human behavior in legal negotiations and there's also a second meaning to the toothpaste tube theory that says there's diminishing returns after a certain point so if you have a bounded system where you have pressure continuing to increase and increase, eventually the system will break if the pressure is not released somewhere, that's the idea behind the toothpaste tube theory.  Applications of the theory  In administrative law, the toothpaste tube theory describes problems of displacement, for instance, where discretion or accountability are shifted elsewhere. In the case, Byrnes v. LCI Communication Holdings Co. an appeals court rejected one formulation of the toothpaste tube theory.http://www.employee- leasing.org/Employee_Leasing_CaseLawDetail57042/Page9.htm In labor law, the toothpaste tube theoryTaking back the workers' law, Ellen J.

Early life He was born on June 6, 1916, in the village of Bachíniva, Chihuahua, the son of Luis Almeida Alderete and María Merino Sáenz. He received his early schooling in his home village before entering the Conciliar Seminary of Chihuahua in 1930, motivated by his parish priest, Vicente Hurtado Saldaña, who had asked for his admittance to the then Bishop of Chihuahua Antonio Guízar y Valencia. Priesthood He attended several seminaries: Chihuahua, Durango, San Luis Potosí y Veracruz. He also attended the Pontifical Gregorian University where he graduated in Philosophy, Dogmatic Theology and Canon Law. He was ordained on April 23, 1943, at the Church of the Gesu in Rome by Mons. Luigi Traglia. In 1946 he returned to Chihuahua where he taught at the Conciliar Seminary. Episcopate On May 28, 1956, Almeida was appointed by Pope Pius XII Bishop of Tulancingo, succeeding Miguel Darío Miranda y Gómez (who in turn was appointed Archbishop of Mexico), and taking charge of one of the poorest bishoprics in Mexico at that time. He was consecrated bishop on August 14, 1956, by Mons. Guízar of Chihuahua, who had earlier been responsible for his admittance to the seminary. Pope John XXIII appointed him in 1962, just before convening the Second Vatican Council, as the ninth Bishop of Zacatecas. During his bishopric he attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, and celebrated the centennial of the Diocese. On August 24, 1969, Pope Paul VI appointed him to succeed Mons. Guizar as second Archbishop of Chihuahua. Through his adaptation of the Social Christian Doctrine as elaborated by the Second Vatican Council, he actively evangelized the less fortunate members of society, and established the permanent Diaconate in the archdiocese. He is also noted as having increased substantially priestly vocations, the establishment of new religious orders, and the founding of new parishes within Chihuahua. He resigned in 1991, becoming Archbishop Emeritus on June 24 during the celebrations of the centennial of the erection of the Diocese. Later years Mons. Almeida remained a beloved figure and active in the archdiocese after his retirement, celebrating daily Mass and ministering to the faithful until his death at age 92 on June 21, 2008. He is buried in the crypt of the Cathedral of Chihuahua. External links * Remembrances of Mons.

In 1971, the San Francisco Unified School District attempted to desegregate the school system by reassigning pupils attending segregated schools to other public schools. The School District submitted a comprehensive plan for desegregation which the District Court approved. Some Chinese parents protested the move, because in the Asian schools the students could learn about their cultural heritage, and they would lose this if they went to public schools. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit entered a temporary stay pending a hearing in the District Court. Four days later, however, the Court of Appeals vacated that stay sua sponte. The District Court then denied the stay. Thereupon, a different three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals heard oral argument on the motions for a stay and denied those motions.

History  The centre opened to the public on 27 October 2003, following a major redevelopment of the site, which had previously been occupied by The Hampshire Centre for around 35 years. Construction of the centre, undertaken by Kier Group, took over two years and cost some £275 million. The annual Pancake Race takes place to raise money for good causes each year. The Hampshire Centre, (19 October 2001)  Car park problems  Netting and props underneath the car park are still in place (May 2011) Shortly after the centre opened, concerns about the condition of the car park came to public attention when B&Q; was forced to temporarily cease trading while the safety of the car park was determined. In May 2005 temporary safety netting was erected in the lower deck area of the east car park and around 1,000 parking spaces were closed to the public after concrete fell from the roof. By 26 May 2005, these parking spaces had re-opened, although the netting remained in place. On 1 December 2005, the car park was again closed to the public following further safety concerns. This led to the temporary closure of all stores within the main site. The stores within the East and West Village were unaffected by this closure and remained open, although parking for these stores was limited. Whilst the centre was closed a free park and ride scheme was introduced to take shoppers to alternative shops within Bournemouth town centre. Following repair work, the car parking spaces and stores in the main centre were re-opened to the public in a phased manner between 20 December 2005 and 13 February 2006. Although the car park was made safe with the insertion of props and the stores in the centre re-opened (and remain so), the longer term solution for rebuilding the carpark is still to be resolved. In December 2014 the centre was given permission by the local council to rebuild the car parks in a phased manned over the next three years, due to be completed by Christmas 2018. The work is to be completed in 5 separate blocks to minimise disruption to shoppers and tenants.  Retailers  Castlepoint has 40 stores and restaurants built over of retail space. Since opening in 2003, several stores have ceased trading at the centre such as Principles, Virgin Megastores, Suits Direct, All Sports, Barratts, Choices Video and Lunn Poly (later Thomson). After the sale of Virgin Megastores in the United Kingdom, the stores were re-branded as Zavvi and after going into administration in 2009, had some of their sites sold to HMV, which operated the site at Castlepoint until 2013, following the closure of some HMV UK stores. Some of the stores, as of April 2020, are Argos, Asda, Accessorize, B&Q; Warehouse, Cafe Nero, CEX, Gap.

During the World War II, the school was closed. To meet the need of the growing churches in the Chin Hills, Bible Schools were opened again in Hakha by the Johnsons, 1948, and in Tedim by the Nelsons, 1947. The said missionaries went home on furlough in 1952. A Bible School was started again in Tedim in 1953; S T Hau Go was the principal there. Though it was not yet official, S T Hau Go gave the name Zomi Baptist Convention Bible School. The school needed to be moved to Hakha in 1954; R G Johnson was the principal there. The first graduation service was held there in 1956. Johnson printed the name Chin Hills Bible School on the first graduation certificate. The Zomi Baptist Convention Executive Committee officially gave the name Zomi Baptist Bible School in December 1956. The Schools both in Tedim and in Hakha were conducted on middle school level. Baptist Mission Secretary, E E Sowards, was much concerned for the upgrading of the school into a high school level. And the school was moved from Hakha to Falam, the District Headquarters, in 1959. Those years testified the fact that theological education work was mobile, shared for management through qualified leaders, regardless of geographical distance. Principal David Van Bik proposed to change the name to Zomi Baptist Theological School, and it was adopted, 1960. The school was renamed Zomi Baptist Theological Seminary as proposed by Principal Simon Pau Khan En, in 1974. The year saw offering of the Diploma Course.

It was based on Eric Ambler's novel Epitaph for a Spy. Unusually, it was both directed and produced by a trio: Lance Comfort, Mutz Greenbaum (credited as Max Greene) and Victor Hanbury. Plot In 1938, refugee Peter Vadassy (James Mason) decides to take a vacation at the Hotel Reserve to celebrate both his completion of medical school and his impending French citizenship. When he goes to pick up some photographs at the local pharmacy, he is taken away and questioned by Michel Beghin (Julien Mitchell) of French naval intelligence. When his negatives had been developed, some of them turned out to be of French military installations. It is discovered that while the camera is the same make as Peter's, the serial number is different. Peter is released on condition that he find out which other hotel guests have cameras like his. Peter does some snooping and eavesdrops on a suspicious conversation between Paul Heimberger (Frederick Valk) and the hotel's proprietor, Madame Suzanne Koch (Lucie Mannheim). He searches Heimberger's room and finds several passports, all with different names and nationalities. Heimberger catches him in the act, but eventually matters are straightened out. Heimberger explains that he was originally a Social Democratic newspaper publisher who was anti-Nazi and been sent to a concentration camp for two years. After he was released, he joined an underground movement against the German regime. Peter spots his camera in the pocket of a dressing-gown belonging to Odette Roux (Patricia Medina) and Andre (Herbert Lom), a couple on their honeymoon. Andre first tries to bribe Peter into giving him the negative and, when that fails, threatens him with a pistol. The police arrive at that moment and arrest Peter for espionage. The Rouxs leave the hotel, but find Heimberger trying to disable the hotel's car. Andre shoots him dead and the couple speed off to Toulon, unaware that they are being tracked by the police. Beghin had known the identity of the spies all along and merely used Peter to further his true goal; to find out who the Rouxs are reporting to. The spy ring is captured. Andre gets away, but is caught on a roof by Peter. Andre slips and falls to his death.

The work shows a middle-class woman attended by a housemaid who is presumably acting as messenger and go-between for the lady and her lover. The work is seen as a bridge between the quiet restraint and self-containment of Vermeer's work of the 1660s and his relatively cooler work of the 1670s. It may have been partly inspired by Ter Borch's painting Woman Sealing a Letter. The painting's canvas was almost certainly cut from the same bolt used for Woman with a Lute. Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid is the first of the artist's experiments with centrifugal composition; where the focus is not only from the centre of the canvas.Wheelock, 116 In addition, it is his third work in which the drama and dynamic is not centred on a single figure.Bonafoux, 124 The maid is shown standing in the mid-ground, behind her lady, with her hands crossed and waiting for the letter to be completed. The positions of their bodies indicate that the two women are disconnected. The folded arms of the maid seem outwardly as an attempt to display a sense of self-containment, however she is detached from her lady both emotionally and psychologically. The maid's gaze towards the half-visible window indicates an inner restlessness and boredom, as she waits impatiently for the messenger to carry her lady's letter away.Pollock, 215 Some art historians dispute the absoluteness of this view; according to Pascal Bonafoux, while complicity is not \\"indicated by a look or a smile\\" from either woman, the mere fact of her presence during such an intimate act as the composition of a love letter indicates at least a degree of intimacy between the two. The painting visits many of Vermeer's usual painterly motifs; in particular his obsession with the inside/outside axis of interior spaces, and through his description of the tiled floor as well as the verticals of the dresses, window frame and back wall painting, his interest in geometry and abstract form. Vermeer had experimented with this painterly device earlier in his career, notably in his View of Delft, The Lacemaker and The Art of Painting.Huerta, 94 Lady Writing was stolen on 27 April 1974, along with a Goya, two Gainsboroughs and three Rubens from the Russborough House home of Sir Alfred Beit by armed members of the IRA.Hart, 11–13 Led by the British heiress Rose Dugdale, the thieves used screwdrivers to cut the paintings from their frames.\\"Russborough House has history of art thefts\\".

According to a RTÉ report, Cahill's taste in art extended only to \\"cheery scenes like the cheap print in his living room of swans on a river, but he believed the stolen masterpieces would bring him a fortune.\\" The painting was eventually recovered during an August 1993 exchange at Antwerp airport which turned out to be a sting operation organised by the Irish police. It had already been donated in absentia to the National Gallery in Dublin.Hart, 58; 193Burns, John & Tallant, Nicola. \\"Double theft reveals secret of Vermeer\\". The Times, 30 May 2004.
