The story tells the adventures of the author as he wanders from store to store in an effort to both complete the unusual tasks required by his employers and find himself along the way. In The Mop, Simpson employs stylized language, powerful description, and the metaphor to explore the taboo sexual situations he is encountered with. Through the journey of the main character, the concepts of \\"normal\\" sexuality, class and social status, and lost love are examined as the main character speculates upon his personal beliefs and place within the subculture he has inadvertently become a part of. The narrator's reflections, along with his descriptions of a clerk's life amidst the thriving red-light district, are woven into the narrative along with Shakespearean literary devices, such as numerous asides. The result is a book that while not specifically a Comedy novel, has been described as \\"laugh out loud funny\\"Torres, Justin Background The book began on an internet messageboard. Soulstrut is a forum for record collectors, DJs, music geeks and the like. Responding to a thread about porn soundtracks, Alan Simpson replied with small anecdotes about his time spent behind the counter of a porn store in Kings Cross. Spurred on by the positive responses, Alan posted more anecdotal stories until starting the (now defunct) blog 'Porn Store Guy'. The blog saw the original anecdotes retold in short story fashion. A narrative thread was missing. Thes One of People Under The Stairs sent Alan a PM (Private Message) offering to publish a book about the porn store stories if Alan would write one. Plot Alan, a twenty something New Zealander meets the girl of his dreams, Malin - a svelte Swede on an Israeli kibbutz while backpacking. Following yearly stints in each other's countries, the couple decides to move to Sydney, Australia to bring some warmth back to their relationship and relive their days in the sun. After flying ahead and sharing a flat with his old friend Greg the surfer, Malin dumps Alan over the phone and his world comes crashing down as he enters a drug and alcohol fuelled self-indulgent pity-fest. Following Greg's advice to ‚ÄúGet his shit together,‚Äù Alan answers an ad in the newspaper for ‚ÄòSpecialty Retail‚Äô and meets Barry, the imposing underworld figure that controls Sydney's porn store trade. Blanketed in a haze of marijuana smoke and alcohol fumes, Alan begins his career in Disco Heaven, Sydney's ultimate gay porn store, where he comes face to face with The Screamer - a perverted masturbating regular and is taken under the wing by Mike, Disco Heaven's charming manager. Alan also meets his nemesis - the jizz mop. It is hate at first sight. Despite Greg's warnings, what begins as a simple amyl nitrite delivery gig quickly mutates into pulling graveyard shifts in Kings Cross, Sydney's notorious red light district as Alan slowly descends into the midnight world of the sexually perverse. Still pining for Malin, and following an amyl nitrite accident, Alan begins working in all five of Barry's stores: Disco Heaven, Cybershit - the toxic neon cave, G. Street - the city's oldest porn store, The Pit - Sydney's filthiest darkroom and R. Street - the most generic of them all. Each have their own personality and Alan endeavors to keep his head above the current as he is swept further down by the Kings Cross undertow. Alan meets Rosie, the young goth who shows him the dark side of being a porn store clerk, Store regular Ram the Bollywood Penis Pumper and Bee, the jaded old Queen who rules over the sex workers with an iron wit. All the while Alan is haunted by the constant presence of the mop. With Greg leaving, Alan finds friendship with water pistol wielding rent- boy Jeff, a fellow music lover who is poised on the edge of a career as a porn clerk lifer and Rita, the gorgeous stripper who glides above it all. Following a sickening assault by Kings Cross's most infamous pervert, Alan says goodbye to Malin. Barry gives Alan the graveyard gig at R. Street and tasks him with training Stinky Dave, an ex-con pervert with personal hygiene issues, bad taste in music and friends in high places. Bridget the giant junkie prostitute makes a grand entrance, Rosie begins to suspect all is not well on planet Dave, the poor Thai business ladies are mentally scarred by Rosie's handiwork and Alan's groove becomes a rut. The mop circles ominously, the boys go hunting one last time, a forgetful customer learns a hard lesson, and we all learn that you should never try to return used sex toys. Bridget tends to Alan's wounds, Jeff teeters on the brink, Dave commits the ultimate transgression, and in a cathartic exercise Alan cleans the store from top to bottom, unearthing some home truths in the process. During an assault with a toxic weapon a most unlikely hero emerges in the heat of the battle, Alan's world comes crashing down once again and, standing in the rubble he finally sees the light.

The line branches from the Mungindi line at Moree and travels in an easterly direction through the town of Gravesend then Warialda Rail, gradually increasing in elevation through Delungra towards the terminus at Inverell. An initial estimate of its intended length was . The line opened in February 1900 as far as Gravesend, then more of the line in 1901 before the Gwydir River bridge was finally finished and the line completed in 1902. It was progressively closed between 1987 and 1994. Currently a section at the Moree end remains in use as a siding for the storage of railway wagons. On 8 August 2016, The NSW Government announced that a 2.8km section of the railway would be reinstated to allow grain to be sent by rail, as part of the Fixing Country Rail pilot round. Up to $2 million was allocated for the project. History An unsuccessful proposal by the mayor of Inverell, James H Hindmarsh was first made in 1872 to construct a railway from Tamworth to the town via Manilla, Barraba and Bingara with the possibility of extending further north to the Queensland border. However, in 1876 the New South Wales parliament approved the construction of a Tamworth to Armidale line which would later extend to the border. In 1894 surveying of a line linking Moree and Inverell began, and the Parliamentary Committee for Public Works recommended it be constructed in 1897. Construction of the first section between Moree and Gravesend commenced in June 1898, opening 1 February 1900. Construction was delayed in May 1900 when the two steel spans of for the bridge across the Gwydir River near Gravesend, the most significant bridge on the line, did not arrive from England on time.Gwydir River railway bridge near Gravesend By the end of 1901, earthworks were completed along the length of the line and a timber trestle bridge across Warialda Creek was nearing completion. The section between Gravesend and Delungra officially opened with the Gwydir River bridge on 25 November 1901, and the final section between Delungra and Inverell on 10 March 1902. Travelling time for passengers between Sydney and Inverell by rail in 1904 was over twenty four hours. In 1910, major flooding destroyed a bridge near Warialda, closing the line for three days until repairs could be completed. Goods traffic carried on the line during its operation was primarily livestock and grain. Several silos, stock loading facilities and associated sidings are still evident along the overgrown alignment. Passenger services were mostly provided by railmotors and ran to timetables which connected with the daily North West Mail train from Sydney to Moree. By the 1970s, the passenger services ran four times a week while goods trains operated on the line each weekday. Petroleum products were also likely carried on the line, evidenced by Shell Oil Company company sidings at Warialda station. Passenger services between Inverell and Moree ceased in 1983. Many smaller stations had closed prior to this date due to declining passenger numbers. The final train from Inverell yard ran on 22 June 1987, and the line beyond Delungra was decommissioned on 2 December 1987.Railway Digest January 1988 page 24 In August 1991, the line was further truncated to Biniguy, with the final section closed on 14 June 1994 and the line listed as out of use beyond a short siding from the junction with the Mungindi line, just south of Moree station. The bridge across the Gwydir River near Gravesend has been listed as a heritage item since 1999. Proposed branches In 1927 the New South Wales parliament passed legislation entitled Inverell to Ashford Railway Act 1927 No 27 to enable the construction of a branch line from a point near the Inverell station to the town of Ashford. The total cost to construct this line was estimated at ‚Ç§262,000. Construction was never started. Legislation was also passed in the form of the Glen Innes to Inverell Railway Act 1950 No 7 to allow for the construction of a link to extend the Moree to Inverell line as far as Glen Innes to connect with the Main Northern line. The estimated cost of construction was ¬£3 million. It was intended that the extended line could function as a quicker route to ports in the Mid North Coast and Northern Rivers regions via the incomplete Guyra to Dorrigo railway. Potential re- use In 2011, the Regional Development Australia Committee - Northern Inland New South Wales backed feasibility studies based on a proposal to reopen and extend the line beyond Inverell to a new export port facility to be located near Iluka or Coffs Harbour. The estimated cost for such a link is approximately A$6 billion. Traffic on the line would be mostly coal from deposits in the Gunnedah Basin and function as an alternative to congested ports in Sydney and Newcastle.

The majority of timber harvested from these lands is shipped to overseas clients as unprocessed logs. Island Timberlands' (IT) corporate office is located in Nanaimo, BC, and the company is certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Forest Management Standard. Industry governed SFI certification is under scrutiny by various environmental watchdogs for greenwashing as 80% of the organization's funding comes from the wood and pulp industry and the environmental standards are adaptable based on the certified area across North America. Under SFI certification, IT is able and planning to harvest old growth forests on Cortes Island in September 2012. Island Timberlands provides limited recreational opportunities for residents and visitors to south, central and east Vancouver Island, including Cortes Island. Access to these lands is limited to weekends between 8am-4pm for licensed, registered vehicles only. IT blocks access by way of gates. IT do not allow quads, ATVs or dirt bikes access. IT routinely block access to lakes (the east side of Boomerang Lake in their Northwest Bay logging division being one example) and lands by trenching or indiscriminately felling trees across trails. More access is sought by residents, user groups and hunters. The proposed logging actions for the Fall of 2012 on Cortes Island have brought them under scrutiny and public petition by Wildstands, a Community group focusing on public awareness of realities and options in the BC forestry industry.

It existed from its founding in 1101 until it was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1242, and only nominally until 1326.Minsk, Principality of Encyclopedia2  Geography  The principality originally occupied territories around the Drut, Svislach and Berezina river basins. Besides the capital city of Minsk, other population centers in the principality included Barysaw, Lahojsk, Zaslawye, Orsha and the historical town of Drutsk.  History  Commemorative coin dedicated to Gleb Vseslavich (2007) The area around Minsk was controlled by the principality of Polotsk beginning from the 10th century. Following the death of Vseslav of Polotsk in 1101, Polotsk was divided into six smaller principalities each to be inherited by one of his six surviving sons. Vseslav's second born son, Gleb Vseslavich inherited the lands surrounding Minsk and started the Minsk branch of the princes of Polotsk. Almost immediately following his father's death, Gleb Vseslavich started a war against his brothers Davyd, prince of Polotsk and Roman, prince of Drutsk to expand his territory. In 1106, he had partaken in a raid against the Baltic tribes in Semigallia. In 1116, he started a war with Vladimir II of the Principality of Kiev and burned the town of Slutsk to the ground. In retaliation, Vladimir marched towards Minsk and laid a two-month siege which was at first unsuccessful but Vladimir wanted to continue the siege following the winter season. Gleb Vseslavich upon seeing the preparations for a long siege, sent peace envoys to the enemy camp and agreed to a peace treaty on the condition of good behavior on his part. Completely ignoring the peace treaty, Gleb resumed his hostilities and in 1117, attacked Smolensk. In retaliation, Vladimir II sent his son Mstislav to Minsk with a large army. He besieged and took Minsk, and brought Gleb to Kiev as prisoner, where he died in 1119. Following the death of Gleb Vseslavich, the principality of Minsk fell under Kievan influence. In 1146, Gleb's son, Rostislav Glebovich regained control of Minsk. Rostislav and his descendants would fight wars with the princes of Drutsk and Vitebsk. This period saw the principality's relationship with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania grow, and in 1164, Rostislav's brother, Volodar Glebovich with the help of the Lithuanians, won an important battle against the Prince of Polotsk, which affirmed the principalities independence from Polotsk. In the 13th century, the influence of Lithuanian princes grew and the princes of Minsk were virtually vassals of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Minsk escaped the Mongol Invasion of Rus in 1237‚Äì1239, however, in later years it was attacked by nomadic invaders from the Golden Horde, who ravaged and vassalized many principalities to the south. Trying to avoid the Tatar Yoke, the Principality of Minsk sought the protection of their Lithuanian allies and in 1242, Minsk was peacefully annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1249, a combined Minsk and Lithuanian army repelled a Tatar-Mongol invasion. The city of Minsk oversaw periods of growth and prosperity during Lithuanian reign and many local nobles enjoyed high ranking in the society of the Grand Duchy. For instance, in 1326, a treaty between Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the city of Novgorod was signed for Lithuanian Prince Gediminas by Vasily, the then ruler of Minsk. In 1413, when the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland signed the Union of Horod≈Ço, the Principality of Minsk ceased to exist and the city became the center of the newly created Minsk Voivodeship.

The Pac-Man character is a letter C, which goes from upper to lower case intermittently (to simulate a chomping Pac-Man). The four ghosts are capital As (which turn to lowercase Ms when the CatChum Pac-Man chomps a power-pellet), and the \\"fruits\\" are represented by dollar signs. One of the major down sides of this clone is that Kaypros of that era did not have the ability to flip the text characters. As a result, even when the character is chomping pellets on his left, for example, his chomping mouth is still on the right. There is no sound.

Life He was born in Milan, and became an Augustinian hermit in 1412. After time studying in Padua he came to the Santo Spirito, Florence in 1418. In 1423 he moved to Bologna, and by the end of the 1420s, after a period at Pavia. He was teaching at the University of Siena, having left Bologna because of anti-papal feeling in 1428. There he died of the plague in 1435. Associations An early influence was Gasparino Barzizza at Padua, and Sicco Polento, another pupil there, became a friend. Biglia in Florence met the humanist circle including Ambrogio Traversari: others were Giovanni Aurispa, Leonardo Bruni and Niccol√≤ Niccoli. In Bologna he associated with Niccol√≤ Albergati. There he encountered Aurispa again, and the other humanists Leon Battista Alberti, Giovanni Lamola, Antonio Panormita, and Giovanni Toscanella. His interest in Islamic history was stimulated by the 1432 visit to Siena of Sigismund of Hungary. Works Biglia wrote a treatise against the populist preacher Bernardino of Siena. In connection with this dispute, Biglia wrote on the Holy Name of Jesus, and these theological writings proved influential. Some of Biglia's own sermons survive. As a historian he wrote on Eastern Christendom and Islam, including a history of the Mongols.

Biography Kennard was born in Columbus, Ohio and studied at Pomona College and Oxford University as part of a Rhodes Scholarship. He went on to earn his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1913, where he would continue most of his scientific career. During a 1926 sabbatical spent at the University of G√∂ttingen, he learned the newly developing quantum mechanics of Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan. With this knowledge, he derived the first rigorous form of the uncertainty principle and fully solved several simple quantum mechanics problems for the first time. In 1926, he was appointed professor of physics at Cornell, which he remained until 1946. In 1941, still at Cornell, he became a part-time consultant at the David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB), the United States Navy modelling facility. In the period 1946‚Äì49 he was the head of the hydromechanics laboratory, and from 1950 until 1957 he was head of the structural mechanics laboratory. From 1957 until his retirement in 1960 he was a general scientific consultant to the commanding officer of the DTMB. Also after his retirement he continued to work for the DTMB under contract. Much of his research for the Navy focussed on hydrodynamics and elasticity, in particular on the theory of potential flow, the physics of underwater explosions and structural vibrations. In 2018, more than 90 years after its prediction, the first experimental observation of Kennard Phase was achieved by a collaboration of researchers from Israeli, German, and American universities.

It is owned and managed by Watford Borough Council. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and has held this status since 1954. Its present name comes from the Anglo-Saxon name \\"Wippa denu\\", meaning \\"Wippa's valley\\". History Whippendell Wood is an ancient woodland, meaning it has been continuously wooded since at least 1600. The wood was formerly part of the Cassiobury estate. There is an avenue of lime trees dating back to 1672, which runs diagonally through the wood. The northern section of the wood was replanted at some point in the 18th or 19th century. Other phases of clearing and replanting followed in the 1940s and 1960s. In 1987, a storm damaged many of the trees in the wood. Wildlife Whippendell Wood has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, due to its diverse range of fungi and invertebrates. Originally, it was listed in 1954 with Harrocks Wood, but was declared as an SSSI on its own in 1986. =Flora= A range of trees can be found in the wood, which is predominantly composed of oak, beech, ash and silver birch. There are also a significant number of cherry, hawthorn, hazel, holly and hornbeam trees. Sycamore trees are also found in the wood, but these are being felled as part of a management plan, as they are not native to the area. The wood is known for its bluebells, which are particularly prominent in April‚ÄìMay. There are also a few rare species of fungus, including Crepidotus cinnabarinus, which has only been recorded on three other occasions in the whole of Europe. First noted in the wood in 1995, samples are now kept at Kew Gardens. =Fauna= The wood is home to a number of bird species, including great spotted, lesser spotted and green woodpeckers, tawny owls and sparrow hawks. Mammals found in the wood include bats, badgers, and deer. Present use The wood is open to the public, and there are several footpaths and orienteering routes through the wood. The wood is popular with dog walkers, and is also used as a shortcut to Cassiobury Park. Horses are not permitted into the wood, but a track for horse riders runs around the perimeter. Whippendell Wood has been used as a filming location for Star Wars; exterior shots for scenes set on the planet Naboo were filmed here for the 1999 prequel, The Phantom Menace. Whippendell has also featured in television series such as Holby City and Silent Witness. Watford Borough Council own the wood, with their maintenance funded by income from filming and the Forestry Commission.

Properties The compound is in the form of non-hygroscopic orange granulate. It is stable in the air for several days when stored away from light, and is stable up to several months if dried in vacuo over potassium hydroxide, decomposing into a white paste. Its stability can be attributed to its insolubility in both polar and non- polar solvents. The compound decomposes at 137 ¬∞C. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid without reduction, and is converted to the black silver(II) oxide in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. It is a powerful oxidizing agent, and is illustrated by the fact that it oxidizes Mn2+ ions to permanganates. When the pyridine ligands were removed, the transient square planar [Ag(H2O)4]2+ remains, which spontaneously oxidizes water to oxygen. : Ag2+ \\\\+ e‚àí Ag+ {E¬∞ = +1.980 V} Applications in organic chemistry The complex ion can easily oxidize alcohol, aldehyde and amine, and capable of decarboxylating Œ±-hydroxycarboxylic acids and phenylacetic acids to give the corresponding carbonyl compounds.Habib Firouzabadi, Peyman Salehi, Iraj Mohammadpour-Baltork. \\"Tetrakis(pyridine)silver(II) Peroxodisulfate, [Ag(py)4]S2O8, a Reagent for the Oxidative Transformations\\" Bull.

Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 564. Jelendol was an industrial settlement in the middle of a fir and beech forest. The sawmill had a production capacity of 700 wagons of lumber per year, which was exported to Italy, Spain, and Africa. Before the Second World War, the village had three houses and a population of 48.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 212. The original residents were evicted from the area in 1941 during the Second World War and the sawmill was burned. After the war, the site consisted of two large buildings surrounded by coniferous forest.

It is a large residential area with a commercial area located along East Monument Street. It comprises approximately 88 whole and partial blocks. The residential area is composed primarily of row-houses that were developed, beginning in the 1870s, as housing for Baltimore's growing Bohemian (Czech) immigrant community. Most of the homes in the district were created after older homes were demolished in order to make room for expansions to the Johns Hopkins Hospital. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the neighborhood was the heart of the Bohemian community in Baltimore. The Bohemian National Parish of the Roman Catholic Church, St. Wenceslaus, is located in the neighborhood. The historic district includes all of Mcelderry Park and Milton-Montford, most of Middle East and Madison-Eastend, and parts of Ellwood Park. History During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the neighborhood was known colloquially as Little Bohemia or Bohemia Village. By 1969, the Czech-American community in Little Bohemia was predominantly composed of ageing homeowners who lived alongside more recently arrived African-American residents. However, many of the older white Czech-Americans harbored racist attitudes towards black people. According to a reporter with 'The Baltimore Sun', \\"The older people of Bohemian extraction still live in the houses they own...but they share the neighborhood with black people whom they do not seem to appreciate or understand.\\" This was the last generation of Czech-Americans to remain in Little Bohemia in large numbers, with the neighborhood transitioning into a predominantly African-American neighborhood by the 1970s and 1980s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 8, 2009.

The family descends from Khalid ibn al-Walid senior companion of the Prophet Muhammad, and esteemed General who was crucial in the Islamic Conquest of Persia and Syria. After Khalid died in Homs, Syria his descendants scattered throughout the Islamic World, stretching from Spain to India. Nowadays they are highly concentrated in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, as well as the Gaza Strip, and Irbid, Jordan. History =Early Caliphate= Khalid ibn al-Walid's son Abdul-Rahman ibn Khalid was very popular throughout the Islamic World and was desired by most people to be the next Caliph. Abdul Rahman had fought on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan's side during the First Fitna, his brother \\"al-Muhajir\\" had fought on Ali's side and was killed. Abdulrahman was poisoned however, his son Khalid had accused Muawiya of the deed, no proof was ever produced however. After the death of Abdul-Rahman's son, the Khalidis disappeared from politics, which lead many Arab genealogists to falsely believe that Khalid's no longer had any progeny. Many members of the family had adopted ascetic lives and embraced Theology. In Aleppo, the Khaldi family had become Sufis practicing the tariqa of Abdul-Qadir Gilani. This line produced many poets and scholars, yet they also soon disappeared from Public eyes. =Mamluk Period= The Khalidis rose to prominence once again during the Crusades. After the Fall of Jerusalem to Salah ad-Din al-Ayyoubi, the city was repopulated by Arabs. Particularly the Khalidis and the Husseinis. The Husseinis, like the Khalidis descended from the Arab Tribe of Quraysh, unlike the Khalidis, the Husseinis descended from Hussein bin Ali, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammed. Both families inhabited Jerusalem tell the modern day, at times, especially during the Ottoman Period they became political rivals. It was during the Mamluk rule in Egypt that the families became social leaders and the Office Mufti of Jerusalem had virtually been in the hands of one family or the other since their arrival. =Ottoman Period= After the fall of Egypt to the Ottomans in 1517, the Khaldi family publicly displayed their loyalty to the Ottoman Royal Family. This loyalty had earned them trust and land. The Eastern Coast of the Arabian Peninsula was granted as a viceroyalty to a branch of the Khaldi family called the Jabrids. Their domain stretched from Basra in South Iraq till the Southern Coasts of Oman. Their rule was challenged however by Portuguese pirates who had been terrorizing the Arabian coasts since Vasco de Gama's first voyage to India. The Khaldis however were able to keep control of their land. One of the Jabrid Emirs, Al-Uray'ir, had built a large fortress in Kuwait meant to keep the Portuguese ships at bay. There rule remained unchallenged for two centuries, until the birth of a particularly notorious figure, Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. Born in the Jabrid domain, Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab was a strict Islamic cleric and had, without legal permission, stoned a woman for adultery. The contemporary Emir was furious with this man who was granting himself the liberty to execute people without any permission by the State. The Emir expelled Ibn AbdulWahhab to the central Arabian Peninsula, known as Nejd. Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab had met with Muhammad ibn Saud the Emir of a small nation called the Emirate of Diriyah. Ibn Saud married his daughter to the cleric and gave him the highest religious authority in his small nation. Together they had plotted against the Ottomans and their vassals in Arabia. The Saudis were quick to annex the Jabrid Emirate, as they had support from the Portuguese blockades. When Napoleon invaded Egypt, the Ottomans were far too busy fighting him to be able to help the Jabrids. The Saudis annexed the Western Coast of Arabia, the Hejaz containing the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina. The Saudis executed the Muftis of the holy cities, as they were considered heretical to the doctrine of Ibn Abdul Wahhab. The Emirate of Diriyah, now encompassing most of Arabia, was short lived. After Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of the Nile he abandoned his army and escaped to France. The Egyptian province or Eyalet was now much stronger under the command of Albanian-Ottoman general Muhammad Ali Pasha. Under command of Sultan Mahmud II, Muhammad Ali Pasha's armies swept through Arabia destroying the Saudi realm and restoring both the Hejaz and Jabrid emirates. The Saudi Ruler and his followers were beheaded for their crimes against the holy cities. The second Jabrids state was short-lived however, as the Second Saudi State was also rising. =Ottoman Constitutional Era and Rise of Zionism= After the Tanzimat reforms were completed in the Ottoman Empire, it adopted a new government type, modeled on that of the average European nation. In accordance with the Ottoman Constitution of 1876, which had turned the Ottoman Empire into a constitutional monarchy, the Ottoman Empire now had a parliament with representatives from every Province. Yusuf Dia-Uddin Pasha Al Khalidi was the representative of Jeruslem in the Parliament, he was also the Mayor of Jerusalem from 1870-1876 and 1878‚Äì1879. Yusuf Dia Pasha, had studied in Malta and learned English and French. He received a letter from Zadok Kahn Chief Rabbi of France, calling him to the Zionist cause. He replied with a letter, \\"In the Name of God, Leave Palestine Alone\\". Zadok Kahn showed the letter to Theodore Herzl the founder of political Zionism, Herzl replied \\"If we are not wanted in Palestine, we will search and we will find elsewhere what we seek\\". Herzl also wrote \\"The Idea in itself is perfect, who could deny the rights of Jews in Palestine, good god, historically it is truly our country.\\" This letter is very commonly falsely cited as a letter written by Yusuf Pasha, these false citations have been used by the Shukri family as to support their claim of the Khaldis collaborating with the Zionists. Yusuf Dia Pasha's nephew, Ruhi al Khalidi was the Mayor of Jerusalem from 1899-1907 and the deputy of the head of parliament in 1911, he wrote extensively on early Zionsim and the threats they posed, he was known to be very cross with the ruling political party the Ittihad ve Terraki for their lack of seriousness with dealing with the Zionist threat. His rising political career ended with his death to Typhoid in 1913. Both Yusuf and Ruhi were part of the Committee of Union and Progress, a right wing party believing in Ottoman Nationalism, as opposed to their Husseini rivals who were Arab Nationalists. =British Mandate= After the Collapse of the Ottomans in WW1 due to the Great Arab Revolt, a British Mandate was set up in Palestine, charged with modernizing Palestine and granting it Independence when it was \\"ready\\". This time period was marked by Arab Nationalists strengthening their regime under the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini. Due to the Khaldis opposition to Nationalism, they had difficult times getting back into politics. With the exceptions of Hussein al-Khalidi who was mayor from 1934‚Äì1937, and Mustafa al-Khalidi who was the last Arab Mayor of Jerusalem from 1938‚Äì1944. Mustafa was like his relatives accused of Zionism, he replied by saying,\\"We must recognise the facts; the zionists have migrated to this country, become citizens, have become palestinians, and they cannot be thrown into the sea. Likewise, some of them have bought land and received deeds in exchange for money and we must recognise them. There is no point in closing our eyes about such things\\". =Modern Day= After the creation of the State of Israel, most Arab countries had turned into monarchies, meaning ascension into the political system was no easy task. Hussein al-Khalidi had managed to be appointed Prime Minister of Jordan, his cabinet was rejected multiple times however, and was forced to give up the position. His memoirs \\"An era of courtesies went on\\" were published by the Khalidi Library in Jerusalem. Descendants of the Jerusalemite branch have become highly influential academics. Walid Khalidi is a Professor of History at Oxford University. Nephew of Hussein al-Khalidi, Rashid Khalidi is a Professor at Columbia University and has written extensively on Palestinian Exodus. The modern day members of the Khalidi family can be found all over the Arab world, however they are very common in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, as well as the Gaza Strip. Many Palestinian Khalidis have sought refuge in Irbid, Jordan, there is reportedly 85,000 Khalidis in Northern Jordan.

Thus, at the beginning of the civil war, he became commander of the destroyer Jos√© Luis D√≠ez and was sent to quell a minor conflict in Alicante when a group of rebel troops from Orihuela and smaller towns of the Vega Baja tried unsuccessfully to initiate a siege of the city. Two months later, he was in charge of the cruiser Miguel de Cervantes, on which he took part in a naval operation that entered the Bay of Biscay (Expedici√≥n al Mar Cant√°brico) in September and October 1936.Gaceta de la Rep√∫blica n¬∫364, 29 de diciembre de 1936 Following the defeat of the Spanish Republican fleet on 27 September 1938 at the Battle of Cape Cherchell, when a series of tactical errors on the part of the Republican command resulted in the loss of two cargo ships, Luis Gonz√°lez de Ubieta became the Captain General of the fleet and promoted to the rank of admiral after his predecessor, Miguel Buiza, was relieved of his duties. President Manuel Aza√±a could not hide his disappointment, acknowledging in his memoirs the indecisiveness of the former commander of the Spanish Republican Navy, despite having a greater number of ships.Manuel Aza√±a, Diarios de Aza√±a, Vol. IV, p. 620 Under Luis Gonz√°lez de Ubieta's command, the Republican Navy concentrated on the protection of maritime convoys supplying the internationally isolated Spanish Republic, as well as the training of naval officers and their ships' crews.Thomas, Hugh, The Spanish Civil War.

End of the war and exile  On 8 January 1939, Luis Gonz√°lez de Ubieta was transferred to Minorca to take the command of the naval base at Port Mahon. He also was given the authority to command all of the Republican military forces on the island.Diario oficial n¬∫22, 22 de enero de 1939 One month later, on 8 February, faced with imminent defeat and under pressure from the authorities of the island, who wanted to avoid bloodshed, Gonz√°lez de Ubieta surrendered the island to the rebels.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. 2003. After the fall of Minorca, Luis Gonz√°lez de Ubieta, who was the military governor of the island, fled to France on the Royal Navy cruiser with 452 other Republican refugees.Jackson, Gabriel.

The Commission was disbanded by the Shiv Sena led government in January 1996 and on public opposition was later reconstituted on 28 May 1996; though when it was reconstituted its terms of reference were extended to include the Mumbai bomb blasts that followed in March 1993. The report of the commission stated that the tolerant and secular foundations of the city were holding even if a little shakily. Justice Srikrishna indicted those he alleged as largely responsible for the second phase of the bloodshed and to some extent the first, the Shiv Sena. The Shiv Sena government rejected its recommendations. Since under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, an Inquiry is not a court of law (even if it conducts proceedings like a court of law) and the report of an inquiry is not binding on Governments, Srikrishna's recommendations cannot be directly enforced. To date, the recommendations of the Commission have neither been accepted nor acted upon by the Maharashtra Government. Many indicted policemen were promoted by the government and indicted politicians continue to hold high political office even today.

The park is the largest in Lincoln and is separated into several branches. S 14th St, a north-south street dissects much of the south end of the park.  Description  Wilderness Park is heavily wooded, but also includes some prairieland. Because of the nature of the unrestricted flow of the Salt Creek in this area, the lay of the park changes over time. Flooding and erosion as well as seasonal fluctuation in the flow of the streams in the area mean that land that is perfectly dry in midsummer or midwinter becomes completely inundated and impassible in Spring or Fall. Boundaries are S 1st St on the west, S 27th St on the east, Van Dorn St on the north and Saltillo Rd on the south - however, not nearly all of the land between these boundaries resides in the park. The park is much wider in the southern segments. Among smaller streams, Beal Slough, a primary tributary to Salt Creek, passes through Wilderness Park. Wildlife in the area includes foxes, deer, raccoons, opossums, frogs, hawks, owls, songbirds, and squirrels, as well as small fish and aquatic invertebrates. It is possible that the area may support larger carnivores such as coyotes, but evidence of this remains to be seen. Wilderness Park features a vast network of dirt walking trails, single-track biking trails, and horse trails. Each trail type is denoted by signs along the trails. The hiking trail was designated part of the National Recreation Trails Program in 1977. The crushed limestone 6.5-mile Jamaica North Trail is mostly located within the park. South of Saltillo Rd, Jamaica North connects to the Homestead Trail corridor, which as of July 2012 reaches to Beatrice, Nebraska, and will ultimately extend to Marysville, Kansas.  History  = Lincoln Park = In 1866, the southern portion of the land that would become Wilderness Park supported a corn mill situated on the Salt Creek. Shortly thereafter, a settler named Phillip Cooper dammed the Salt Creek to create a pond for the purpose of making ice in the winter. In 1873, Cooper dug a cave in the area to store the ice during the summer. Cooper sold the land to Lincoln attorney and mayor A.J. Sawyer in 1887. Sawyer rebuilt the dam in concrete in 1900 and opened the area as Lincoln Park. Some time after this, the land was purchased by the Burlington Railroad to operate Lincoln Park and more importantly to use Salt Creek as a water source for their steam engines. The railroad pumped roughly one million gallons of water from the Salt Creek through a twelve inch pipe to their roundhouse located southwest of Lincoln. The first Boy Scouts of America troop formed in Nebraska in 1910, quickly becoming immensely popular, and began meeting in Lincoln Park in 1912. In 1916, the park was purchased by Lincoln Traction Co. who used the power generated by the damming of Salt Creek to light the park with arc and incandescent lighting, earning it the nickname Electric Park. The park was closed in 1935 and leased to the Boy Scouts Cornhusker Council. The Cornhusker Council continued using the park as a campsite, eventually buying the land and renaming it Camp Minis-Kuya. Camp Minis-Kuya closed in 1956. = Epworth Park = Concurrently in the late 1890s, a Methodist organization called the Epworth Association sought to bring the \\"camp meeting\\" style of retreat popularized at Chautauqua, New York, to Nebraska. The Epworth Association held its first retreat in Lincoln Park but subsequently purchased its own 40-acre lot of land directly south of Lincoln Park to develop. In 1903, the Epworth Association opened Epworth Park selling 1,500 tickets a day in its first week and audiences grew to 5,000. In its first season, Epworth Park made $10,000 of which it donated \\"$800 - to worn out preachers and $1,000 to Nebraska Wesleyan [a Methodist college near Lincoln].\\" By 1915, Epworth Park featured an open- air pavilion which could seat 5,000, a boy scout cabin, and two foot bridges which connected to the man-made island called \\"Oxford Isle\\" in the center of the man-made Epworth Lake. Fed by water from the Salt Creek, Epworth Lake allowed park-goers to swim and canoe. Epworth Lake was also the site of the park's \\"Venetian Nights\\" in which families could rent ornately-decorated rafts and rowboats to leisurely ride around the lake. The growing popularity of the park, an average of 3,000 residents at its height, led to the construction of a village of cabins, a 60-room dormitory, and a 150-room hotel, as well as four restaurants, a grocery store, bakery, bookstore, and post office. Burlington and Union Pacific railroads ferried passengers to the park at half- price from Lincoln. The main focus of the park was religious outreach, but the park also featured animal shows; musical acts such as the U.S. Army Band, Enrico Caruso, and the Swiss bell ringers; magicians; and popular speakers such as Theodore Roosevelt, William Jennings Bryan, Howard Taft, Booker T. Washington, and Billy Sunday. In 1935, 14 inches of rain fell over the course of one week, causing flooding which destroyed most of the buildings in the park. Unsuccessful efforts were made to reopen the park, but American culture had changed with the advent of cars and mass communication. Families no longer needed to physically attend major speeches or concerts as they could now listen to them on the radio. Similarly, automobiles meant that families could quickly drive wherever they pleased for relatively low cost and no longer relied on the trains and streetcars which had helped to make Epworth Park thrive. = Wilderness Park = In 1966, Epworth Park was donated to the City of Lincoln. Four years later in 1970, Lancaster County acquired Camp Minis- Kuya (formerly Lincoln Park) for $60,000. Epworth Park, Camp Minis-Kuya, and several other parcels of land in public domain were consolidated to create Wilderness Park. Although vegetation, erosion, flooding, and settling have obscured much of the former features of both Epworth Park and Lincoln Park, evidence of the developments in the area can still be found such as pieces of the concrete dams and metal pipes. Additionally, the original entrance to Epworth Park, a stone archway, can be found on the south side of 1st and Calvert streets at the edge of the park. = 1894 Rock Island Railroad Wreck = The site of the 1894 Rock Island railroad wreck, an act of sabotage which killed 11, lies within Wilderness Park. The trestle where the derailment occurred passes above the Jamaica North Trail at . Historical Marker at the site of the 1894 Rock Island Railroad Wreck = Bridges = Wilderness Park is home to at least a dozen pedestrian bridges of varying architecture and age. In 2010, the center of one bridge in the south end of the park collapsed roughly fifteen feet as around 20 children from a day camp were crossing the structure. Although no one was seriously injured in the fall, the incident prompted a review of all bridges in the park.  Urban legends  Two main urban legends surround Wilderness Park. One legend claims that the ghosts of the 1894 Rock Island Railroad wreck are still present in the park. The second legend claims that in the early twentieth century, Wilderness Park was a wooded wasteland at the edge of town inhabited by a mysterious old woman. According to the legend, the disappearances of several young children were blamed on the old woman who was deemed a witch before being killed and buried in the park by the townspeople. The story claims that the witch's ghost still haunts the park and her grave must not be disturbed lest she rise again to take revenge. This legend is actually the plot of an independent film, Wake the Witch (2010), shot and set in Lincoln. The premise of the film--that the area was a largely uninhabited wilderness--is entirely false as most of the area was actually a popular resort with an average of 3,000 residents a day. The remaining portion of the park was owned by an electrical utilities company which lit most of the park with incandescent and arc lighting. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any woman was ever killed for suspected witchcraft or kidnapping in the park. The writer and director of the film have confirmed that the film is entirely fictional.

Discovery This stellar stream was originally proposed in 1995 by Donald Lynden-Bell after analyzing the distribution of globular clusters in the Milky Way. The actual structure was identified by Newberg et al. (2002)The Ghost of Sagittarius and Lumps in the Halo of the Milky Way and Majewski et al.

In 2006, Belokurov and his collaboratorsThe Field of Streams: Sagittarius and Its Siblings found that the Sagittarius Stream has two branches. Association with spiral arm layering The shredding apart of a large intruding collection of stars in the indefinite past appears to have sent oscillations analogous to sound waves through the Milky Way spiral arm structure. The effects of the oscillations are observed today as vertically stacked layers of alternately denser and sparser star distributions above and below the Solar System. Presently, the Sagittarius Stream is positioned relative to the observed layers such that its progenitor, the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, is the strongest candidate intruder whose wake left behind the disturbance in the spiral arms.

A motor control center (MCC) is an assembly to control some or all electric motors in a central location. It consists of multiple enclosed sections having a common power bus and with each section containing a combination starter, which in turn consists of motor starter, fuses or circuit breaker, and power disconnect. A motor control center can also include push buttons, indicator lights, variable-frequency drives, programmable logic controllers, and metering equipment. It may be combined with the electrical service entrance for the building. MCC's are typically found in large commercial or industrial buildings where there are many electric motors that need to be controlled from a central location, such as a mechanical room or electrical room. Voltage ranges Motor control centers are usually used for low voltage three-phase alternating current motors from 208 V to 600 V. Medium-voltage motor control centers are made for large motors running at 2300 V to around 15000 V, using vacuum contactors for switching and with separate compartments for power switching and control.Robert W. Smeaton (ed) Switchgear and Control Handbook 3rd Ed., Mc Graw Hill, New York 1997 , chapter 26 Usage Motor control centers have been used since 1950 by the automobile manufacturing industry which used large numbers of electric motors. Today they are used in many industrial and commercial applications. Where very dusty or corrosive processes are used, the motor control center may be installed in a separate air-conditioned room, but often an MCC will be on the factory floor adjacent to the machinery controlled. Components A motor control center consists of one or more vertical metal cabinet sections with power bus and provision for plug-in mounting of individual motor controllers. Very large controllers may be bolted in place but smaller controllers can be unplugged from the cabinet for testing or maintenance. Each motor controller contains a contactor or a solid-state motor controller, overload relays to protect the motor, fuses or a circuit breaker to provide short-circuit protection, and a disconnecting switch to isolate the motor circuit. Three-phase power enters each controller through separable connectors. The motor is wired to terminals in the controller. Motor control centers provide wire ways for field control and power cables. Specifications Each motor controller in an MCC can be specified with a range of options such as separate control transformers, pilot lamps, control switches, extra control terminal blocks, various types of thermal or solid-state overload protection relays, or various classes of power fuses or types of circuit breakers. A motor control center can either be supplied ready for the customer to connect all field wiring, or can be an engineered assembly with internal control and interlocking wiring to a central control terminal panel board or programmable controller. Fire protection Motor control centers usually sit on floors, which are often required to have a fire-resistance rating. Firestops may be required for cables that penetrate fire-rated floors and walls.

It was the tenth named storm and the fifth typhoon of the 2012 Pacific typhoon season. The name Damrey means elephant in Khmer, the official language of Cambodia. Damrey developed into a tropical storm north of the Tropic of Cancer on July 28 and drifted slowly. By late on July 30, Damrey began to accelerate west- northwestward. The storm struggled to make deep convection wrap around itself due to vertical wind shear and dry air since formation, until it passed near Kyushu on August 1. Damrey finally intensified into a typhoon early on August 2, a half of day before it made landfall over the northern Jiangsu. Meteorological history Late on July 26, a tropical disturbance formed southwest of Minamitorishima, which was originally associated with the divergent north of a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July 27, as the original TUTT cell weakened, an upper-level anticyclone was building on the system. Although not being a fully warm-core system initially, it intensified into a tropical depression according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), when sea surface temperature ranged from 29 to 31 ¬∞C. However, the low-level circulation center (LLCC) became exposed later. On July 28, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system, before JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Damrey. Late on the same day, JTWC upgraded Damrey to a tropical depression, with a partially exposed LLCC under moderate northwesterly vertical wind shear. Damrey drifted southwestward slowly on July 29, as it was positioned south of a col region produced by an upper-level mid-latitude shortwave trough digging east of Japan. At noon, JTWC upgraded Damrey to a tropical storm based on consolidation within the LLCC, although overall convection has slightly decreased. A second TUTT cell located to the east approached and began to enhance eastward outflow, yet the south TUTT which provided convergence filled up. On July 30, Damrey began to track northwestward. The LLCC of Damrey became well-defined and fully exposed, as dry air surrounded the west semi-circle. By late on July 30, Damrey intensified into a severe tropical storm northeast of Chichi-jima and began to accelerated west-northwestward along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge to the north. The storm started to rebuild central convection on July 31, yet troughing and dry air entrainment degraded outflow over the southern portion. On August 1, deep convection finally wrapped around the LLCC because of tracking over the warmest regions of the Kuroshio Current, as well as dry air began to weaken. When Damrey passed near Yakushima at 06Z, the system developed a central dense overcast. According to JTWC Best Track Data, Damrey became a typhoon at 12Z. Poleward outflow channel still remained, but increasing convergence from the outflow of Typhoon Saola produced subsidence on the southern semi-circle and limited convection. Both Damrey (upper) and Saola (lower) approaching and making landfall over China on August 2 Based on RSMC Best Track Data, Damrey intensified into a typhoon west of Jeju at 00Z on August 2, when it just arrived at the Yellow Sea. At the moment, the typhoon featured a ragged eye with a symmetric eyewall, yet deepest convection was mostly confined to the northern semi-circle. As Saola weakened into a severe tropical storm and became quasi-stationary near Taiwan, its outflow has weakened due to an increase in distance between two systems. Unlike JTWC analyses that Damrey began to gradually weaken after 00Z on August 2, JMA analyses that the typhoon reached peak intensity at 06Z, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 70 knots (130 km/h, 80 mph) and the atmospheric pressure at . Damrey was still tracking along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge anchored over Kyushu, Japan, when the system had a ragged eye with a symmetric eyewall. After slightly weakening, Damrey made landfall as a minimal typhoon over Xiangshui County in Jiangsu, China at 13:30 UTC (21:30 CST). Because of land interaction, the system weakened into a severe tropical storm near Lianyungang at 18Z, when JTWC also downgraded it to a tropical storm with a final warning. Early on August 3, Damrey weakened into a tropical storm north of Linyi in Shandong, and then it turned northward. A half of day later, the system weakened into a tropical depression northeast of Binzhou, before it turned northeastward and arrived at the Bohai Sea. The system dissipated near the coast of Qinhuangdao in Hebei on August 4. Preparations and impact Prior to Typhoon Damrey's arrival in eastern China, officials issued a red alert, the highest level of warning in China's alert system, for Jiangsu Province and ordered the evacuation of 100,000 residents. Striking Jiangsu Province on August 2, Damrey brought damaging wind gusts up to and heavy rains to the region. At least 21 counties across Jiangsu and neighboring Shandong Provinces were affected by the storm. Across Shandong Province, rainfall from the storm reached . According to officials, two people were killed and twenty- nine others were injured in the hard-hit Rizhao area. Overall, at least 1,718 homes were destroyed and approximately 30,000 were damaged. Economic losses in the province were estimated at ¬•1.69 billion (US$265.2 million). Severe flooding in Liaoning Province triggered by the typhoon's heavy rains destroyed approximately 10,000 homes and damaged 17,000 more. Economic losses from the storm were estimated at ¬•2.36 billion (US$371 million). In Benxi, severe flooding along the Sandaohe and Xihe Rivers trapped about 300 construction workers in a tunnel on August 6\\\\. Nine people were killed and four others were reported missing in the province. In neighboring Hebei Province, another 9,400 homes were destroyed and five person was killed and another was reported missing. Between the two provinces, at least 3.79 million people were affected by the storm. On August 4, the Chinese government launched a relief operation to aid victims of the flooding. In all, 48 people were killed in China, and total economic losses amounted to be CNY29 billion (US$4.55 billion).

The group shut down its operations in August 2014. The Syrian Support Group was the only organization legally permitted by the U.S. government to provide support directly to the Free Syrian Army (FSA).U.S. eases arms purchases for Syrian rebels The Syrian Support Group provided non-lethal aid to units of the FSA which it determined had no affiliation with extremist groups such as the Al-Nusra Front.  History  A team of Syrian expatriates, led by Ontario resident Louay Sakka, founded the SSG when they came to the conclusion that armed revolution was necessary. On 23 July 2012, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control granted the organization its license to fund the Free Syrian Army. On Wednesday, 1 August 2012, a Treasury Department official confirmed that they had given Syrian Support Group this license. The license requires that the organization make monthly reports of their expenditures to the U.S. Department of State. A copy of SSG's OFAC license can be viewed in full here. In February 2013, the Chief of Staff of the Syrian opposition's Supreme Military Council, General Salim Idris, agreed to work with international governments via the Syrian Support Group in order to secure equipment for his fighters. General Idris also signed the Syrian Support Group's Proclamation of Principles on behalf of the Supreme Military Council. On 30 April 2013, the Syrian Support Group provided logistics and transport for United States aid to the Free Syrian Army. The aid, which included $8 million in MREs and WALK kits (Warrior Aid and Litter Kits), is currently being distributed from warehouse facilities in northern Aleppo. This aid distribution has expanded into several additional shipments of food and medical supplies, totaling over $10 million. In July 2013, a Daily Telegraph article reported that the U.S. State Department warned the SSG that any funds it gathered could not be used for weapons. The article reported that this event lead to a decline in SSG's private donations, with the group never having more than $200,000 in its accounts. The article also claimed that in June 2013 the head of the SSG in Washington resigned after the group failed to gain traction with US Government officials. In a publicized rebuttal, SSG denied that such a warning had ever occurred, citing its ongoing relationship with the State Department as the \\"implementing partner\\" for aid shipments, as well as Ambassador Robert Ford's letter of appreciation. The SSG also maintained that the support of its donor base had not waned, and in fact this support had led to the organization's hiring of new staff members. The Daily Telegraph article reported that the group's former European government affairs director, David Falt, alleged that the SSG spent months trying to negotiate deals to sell rights to Syrian oil output worth hundreds of millions of dollars. This effort was reportedly headed by former NATO official Brian Sayers. According to Mazen Asbahi, the president of SSG, the group's board eventually cancelled these attempted oil deals after becoming uncomfortable with them. Additionally, in a letter to the editor of the Daily Telegraph, Sayers denied that oil transactions were intended to benefit the organization itself, stating that SSG explored \\"using revenues from petroleum\\" and other materials for the direct benefit of the Free Syrian Army. Sayers also asserted that \\"forged and fraudulent emails\\" were used to form the article.\\"Sayers' letter to the editor of the Daily Telegraph\\" https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B26jFZebiuQLQVE2aE9RYU5waVU/edit?pli=1  Funding  The Syrian Support Group relied on private donations to support its operations.

Biography Vogel was born in New York and attended Townsend Harris High School. He started working part-time as an usher and at age 18 was appointed manager of the Fulton Theatre for Loew's. He became the manager of Loew's State Theatre in New York City when it opened in August 1921. He worked his way up Loew's Theatres and by 1945 was director of all their theatres. In 1954 when government decree separated Loew's production and distribution actives from the exhibition company, Vogel was elected president of Loew's Inc. =MGM presidency= In October 1956 Vogel replaced Arthur M. Loew as president of MGM. He had to deal with a significant corporate turmoil, including a takeover attempt in 1957 from former president Louis B. Mayer in association with two board members, Stanley Meyer and Joseph Tomlinson. Mayer attacked Vogel calling him a \\"fool\\" and not \\"capable of filling the post ‚Äì no more capable of filling it than you would be fighting the heavyweight champion.\\" However Vogel managed to fight off the takeover attempt and Mayer died of leukemia in 1957. Vogel and his head of production Sol Siegel initially enjoyed a number of successful years at MGM, green lighting such movies as Gigi (1958), North by Northwest (1959), King of Kings (1961) and most notably Ben-Hur (1959). However they also oversaw a number of expensive flops, such as the remakes of Cimarron (1960), Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1961), and especially Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), which ultimately caused millions in losses. Vogel was forced to resign in January 1963, replaced by Robert O'Brien and kicked upstairs to the role of chairman. Four months later he retired to Palm Beach, where he would die of a heart attack. He was survived by a wife Lena and son Richard. He was the brother of cinematographer Paul Vogel.

The prayer books in this church are in the Northern Sami language, since that is the predominant language for the people of the area. Designed by Christian Heinrich Grosch and built of wood in 1858, it has seats for 250 people. It was fully restored in 1983. The church has a narrow choir whose floor is higher than that of the nave. There are sacristies beside the choir, which has a lower ceiling, of a type called a \\"saddle ceiling\\", than that of the nave. The roof is supported by wooden columns which separate the central nave from two side-naves. This style was used in churches designed by Grosch in the 1850s. The nave is also distinguished from the two side-naves by the fact that the latter have lower ceilings, a feature which, apparently, Grosch derived from German church design. Adjacent to the church is what is regarded by some as the oldest chapel in the Varanger area, dating from the 18th century.

The expedition attempted to canoe down the Snake River in 1811 and had already lost one of their party to the river when they encountered the waterfall. The churning waters of the falls inspired the expedition to abandon the river and continue on land to the Pacific. The falls most likely were named by a Scottish member of the party, there being a waterfall in Scotland of the same name. East of present-day Murtaugh, the waterfall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 for its role in the expedition.

The Challenge was concluded successfully in Cyprus on 7 October, 27 days later. The event was funded by Ferrero, the chocolate maker. The Challenge was timed to coincide with the European Year of Volunteering and to raise funds for charity. The first aim of the challenge was to break the world record of consecutive full marathons (42.2 km) in different countries back to back. This was accomplished using a wide range of transport including and primarily a 4-bed camper van that was driven by professional driver Lawrence Cachia from Malta. Nathan was supported by Clifford Sultana who cycled adjacent to provide food and hydration on the run. A number of journalists joined the camper van for days or short stretches to record the event. Each run started at a designated time in various European cities and the official marathon or equivalent recognised distance was measured and covered. The second aim of the challenge was to raise funds for children's charities in the countries visited. Over ‚Ç¨100,000 was raised (including Ferrero sponsorship) for charities chosen by the Ferrero representative in each country. The largest fundraising effort came from Malta, and was shared between Inspire Foundation and the Daniel Delicata Memorial Association for the construction of a children's outdoor play area at the new national Mater Dei Hospital. Other charities benefitted across the EU including the Children's Society in England. Medical Interest - due to the extreme nature of the event a number of medical professionals monitored Nathan's health. Nathan is not a professional athlete and therefore there was worry about the ability of his body to tolerate the 300 km or so a week of running, for 4 whole weeks. Surprisingly, Nathan suffered no major ill effects except for a muscle tear in Marathon 10. Subsequently, his finishing times improved as the days past with the majority of the runs finishing under 4hrs. His fastest was 3hr34min (number 26 in Greece) and his slowest was Rotterdam where he was injured (in 4hr 40min). Veracity of success - Nathan was tracked by live GPS spotter to confirm distance covered, as well as being followed by eyewitnesses and the media in most countries.

History The neighborhood developed in the late Ottoman times during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II (1876-1909) as a residence area for high court officials. In the western part of the area, wealthy Levantines and other non-Muslims settled. Wooden mansions within lavish gardens were built in G√∂ztepe and around. At the suburb, there were also farms and dairies, which supplied the court with their products as well. G√∂ztepe railway station is the fourth stop from Haydarpa≈üa Terminal on the commuter line of Haydarpa≈üa-Gebze. Its opening followed the establishment of the Baghdad Railway, and contributed to further settlement in the area. In the first half of the 20th century, the area was populated as a summer resort mostly. While many of the historic wooden mansions made place for modern buildings following fires, a small number of them still exist.

A new species of frog called Leptolalax tamdil was described from this lake in 2010. Origin The origin and etymology of ·π¨am Dil are shrouded in myth. Folklore has it that a married couple had a jhum plot in this small valley surrounded by small steep hills. The man unfortunately died leaving the wife to care for the crops alone. In the middle of the field was a robust mustard plant, conspicuously bigger than any other plants. One night the widow has a visitation by her husband, who informed her to take special care of the giant mustard plant as it was a harbinger of immense blessing. On the wake, she did as told, and the plant thrived very well. As time went, the widow remarried but the new husband objected to any thing reminiscence of the deceased husband, and so he plucked the plant up by the roots and discarded it. The vast hole left in the ground was then soon filled by water (seeping from the plant, according to some versions; from the ground itself, in another version) to become an exquisite lake. Hence the name of ·π¨am Dil, for the \\"lake of the mustard\\". Tourism The lake is reconstructed as part of building a fishing reservoir by the Fisheries Department, Government of Mizoram.

V√°gsei√∞i is an area in V√°gur, Faroe Islands, located on the west coast of Su√∞uroy west of the village V√°gur, from which it takes its name. Ei√∞i is the Faroese word for Isthmus. The distance between the east and the west coast of V√°gur is only one km. There is a lake between the village and V√°gsei√∞i, the lake is called Vatni√∞, which is the Faroese word for Lake. The football stadium of FC Su√∞uroy and the sports hall V√°gsh√∏ll are located on V√°gsei√∞i, 100-200 m from the cliffs. The natural harbour on V√°gsei√∞i is called Kleivin. The 200 m high cliff south of V√°gsei√∞i is called Sk√∫vanes, and the cliffs from Sk√∫vanes towards south are called Eggjarnar. There is a skerry, which looks like some rocks, in the bay of V√°gsei√∞i, this skerry is called Heltnarnar. The sea is often rough here and the waves often break against the cliffs here, and often Heltnarnar almost disappear in the surf.Fr√≥√∞skaparrit 54. b√≥k, 2006, Faroe University Press, page 21, (Faroese book), Google books.  History  There is a small boat harbour on V√°gsei√∞i, no pier or anything like that, just a natural harbour. It is not in daily use anymore, but in the 19th and early 20th century it was a busy harbour for fishing boats. Kleivin is partially natural harbour and partially man made. Part of the cliffs have been taken away by dynamite in 1929, concrete was used to improve the harbour and wooden stocks for the boats were sat on the concrete, in order to make it easier to take the boats down to the sea. In 1906 fishermen from V√°gur made a cable way from the gorge M√∫lagj√≥gv in the west towards east to V√°gsei√∞i. The sea is more calm in the gorge, and it was better to take the boats from M√∫lagj√≥gv up in the air, pulled by man power using the cable way, better than using the dangerous sea around Heltnarnar to Kleivin. The cable way was one of the reasons that the first electricity power plant in the Faroe Islands was made a few kilometers north of V√°gsei√∞i, on the other side of the mountain Gj√≥gv√°rafjall in a place called Botn or √ç Botni (In the Bottom). They wanted electricity for the cable way in order to drag the boats ashore. The cable way was partially financed by the fishermen who used it and partially by V√°gur Municipality.Book: Poul Andreasen \\"V√°gs Kommuna 100 √°r\\" (in Faroese)Tr√°√∞banin (archive) The sea is often very rough on V√°gsei√∞i, so it could be dangerous to go fishing from this place, but they fishermen had great respect for the weather conditions. They used the other harbour on the east coast when the weather didn't allow them to go fishing from V√°gsei√∞i. There used to be boat houses on V√°gsei√∞i, but a hurricane on 14 January 1989 which caused much damage and caused the sea to go over its level, took away most of these boat houses and they have not been re- built since then. The boats are now in other boat houses around the fjord of V√°gur, V√°gsfj√∏r√∞ur. Sometimes they make excursions in old wooden boats starting from V√°gsei√∞i. The boats then get transported by trucks to V√°gsei√∞i. In May 2010 people from V√°gur and from some of the neighbour villages made an excursion with the old wooden rowing boats which are called Grindab√°tar, to Sumba in the south and back again.Dokumentar.fo, Grindab√°tar √° fer√∞ av V√°gsei√∞i til Sumbiar  Gallery  File:Heltnarnar Vagur Suduroy Faroe Islands.jpgRough sea on Heltnarnar, seen from Kleivin on V√°gsei√∞i.

Description The tree or bush typically grows to a height of with round holly-like leaves that are sinuate and have nine sharp points or more per leaf. The leaves are opposite and long with a slightly angular margin. It blooms between July and November and produces orange to yellow and red to brown flowers. The pea- shaped flowers are approximately wide and usually bloom en masse. Seeds produced are small and for every one gram there are approximately 70 seeds. The species was first described by the botanist George Bentham in 1864 in the journal Flora Australiensis. Habitat It is found in the Jarrah Forest and Warren IBRA regions in the South West and Great Southern regions of Western Australia, where it grows in clay or loam soils over laterite or granite. It is a common understorey shrub in forested areas where jarrah and marri trees are found. Cultivation It can be grown from seed and prefers a light to medium well-drained moist soil in a semi-protected position. It is drought resistant but susceptible to frost.

The ranger station comprises nine wood frame buildings that are representative of the Bungalow/Craftsman architectural style employed by the U.S. Forest Service in its administrative facilities from 1910 to 1940. The original ranger station was built in 1910 as a combination residence and office. Supporting structures included a barn, root cellar and privy.

The barn was removed in the 1920s and was eventually replaced by a shed covered with corrugated metal, possibly re- using the barn's timbers. The root cellar was expanded in the 1930s by CCC labor, using faced stone from the nearby Hammond Mine. A new barn was built in 1934.

Facts  The court a quo had found a tacit universal partnership to have existed between the appellant, Hans Gunter Ponelat, and the respondent, Erica Schrepfer. From 1989 to 2005, the appellant and the respondent lived together as man and wife, sharing a joint household, first in Benoni and then in Plettenberg Bay. In the course of their relationship, the respondent contributed all she had to the joint household, financially and physically, together with the proceeds of the sale of her assets, her salary, her time, her energy, her labour, her skills and her expertise. The appellant contributed his electrical business, financed the various properties owned by the parties and provided financial security for them. The respondent also assisted with the administration of the appellant's business, and provided for his needs and comfort. After they moved to Plettenburg Bay, the respondent assisted with administration on the farm and in providing accommodation for tourists. The relationship between the parties came to an end on April 1, 2005, whereafter the respondent moved into a flat of her own. The question before the court on appeal was whether a tacit universal partnership could be inferred from the proven facts.  Judgment  The SCA held that the nature of the discussions between the parties prior to their cohabitating, and their intent during their years together, indicated that they had the requisite animus contrahendi to form a universal partnership. The essentials of a contract of universal partnership had been established: * Each party had brought something into the partnership; * the partnership had been carried on for their joint benefit; and * the object had been to make a profit. The SCA accordingly concurred with the trial court's decision that a universal partnership had come into being in March 1989 and was terminated on April 1, 2005.

They delivered judgment on March 28, 2012. JJ Gauntlett SC (with RG Buchanan SC) appeared for the appellant, and A. Beyleveld SC (with NJ Mullins) for the respondent. The court found that universal partnerships of all property which extend beyond commercial undertakings were part of Roman-Dutch law and still form part of South African law. Where the partnership enterprise extends beyond commercial undertakings, the contribution of both parties need not be confined to a profit-making entity. The court held also that a universal partnership of all property does not require an express agreement. Like any other contract, it may also come into existence by tacit agreement: that is, by an agreement derived from the conduct of the parties. The requirements for a universal partnership of all property, including universal partnerships between cohabitees, were found to be the same as those formulated by RJ Pothier, in A Treatise on the Law of Partnership, for partnerships in general. Finally, where the conduct of the parties is capable of more than one inference, the test for when a tacit universal partnership may be held to exist is whether it is more probable than not that a tacit agreement had been reached.Paras 18-19.

In 2007 the City of Willoughby commissioned new designs to replace the old Chatswood Civic Centre. The first Willoughby Town Hall was built on the site in 1903. The hall doubled as the Council Chambers and the site was shared with the Council Pound, the School of Arts and the Ku-ring-gai Masonic Lodge. A three story administration building was also built on the site in 1967 (with a fourth floor added in 1980). In 1972, the original Town Hall was demolished and replaced by a new Civic Centre, comprising the Town Hall which seated 850 people, and the smaller Bailey Hall, which seated 350. This building played an essential part in Willoughby City‚Äôs community and culture for many years. The new cultural complex was designed by Francis-Jones Morehen Thorphttp://www.fjmt.com.au/ architects. Following demolition of the old buildings, construction began on The Concourse in July 2008 at a cost of approximately $162 millionhttp://www.willoughby.nsw.gov.au/Community/Facilities/The- Concourse/Project-Funding-and-Costs/ and was complete in July 2011. The complex was officially opened on 17 September 2011 by the Governor of NSW, Marie Bashir.http://www.visitchatswood.com.au/history/the-concourse/ In addition to a 5,000m2 library, The Concourse at Chatswood features a large public open space, a 500-seat theatre, rehearsal spaces, a 1,000-seat concert hall, caf√©s, retail and commercial outlets, a boutique hotel and a multi- purpose exhibition hall. The Concourse also includes car parking over two entire basement levels and a 5,000m3 storm water detention tank as part of an integrated water management system.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WVx3ErTyHo Within the ground floor of The Concourse a gallery known as The Art Space has been installed, this is a community 92 sq.m. space and features weekly art exhibitions from local artists and art collectives. It is equipped with professional track lighting and hanging systems. For the Chatswood Library, where reading light for eyes of all ages was a central issue, lighting specialists Klik Systems were enlisted to design & construct energy-efficient beam luminaires. Klik Systems also contributed lighting to the new Canberra Airport and to the interactive digital art fa√ßade called Luminous at Darling Quarter Sydney. The Chatswood library occupies 5,000m2 on the lower ground level, entered via the main podium. Patrons Patrons of The Concourse include leading figures in Australia‚Äôs arts industries including soprano Yvonne Kenny, poet Les Murray, authors Matthew Reilly and Ren√©e Goossens and rock icon Angry Anderson AM. Reilly, author of the best selling thriller Ice Station said. \\"For any writer, it all starts at your local library.

The loch has a large catchment area in the hills which surround it and six feeder stream drain these hills and their moorland. It has a surface area of and its surface is above sea level. The railway line between Airdrie and Bathgate runs along the southern shore of Hillend Loch. History Hillend Loch is a naturalised reservoir established between 1797 and 1799 when the North Calder Water was dammed, an enterprise which employed up to 1,500 people at one time. It was, at the time the dam was constructed, the largest man-made reservoir in the world. It still supplies water to the Forth & Clyde Canal and the remains of the Monkland Canal. As well as the supply of drinking water the loch was to used to supply water to the steel and paper mills in the new industrial towns of Airdrie and Coatbridge. Fishing The fishing rights have been managed by Airdrie & District Angling Club since 1949 and they stock the loch during the angling season on a weekly basis. It has a naturally occurring stock of brown trout but these are supplemented by stocking with brown trout and the non-native rainbow trout. Fishing is by permit and fishing both from boats and from the shore is allowed. Wildlife Hillend Loch has a variety of habitats around its shores, including mature mixed woodlands, meadows, peat bog, reed beds and heather moorland. A wide range of migratory ducks, geese and swans are attracted to the loch in winter while there are breeding populations of Eurasian coot, common moorhen and wildfowl. Among the more regularly recorded species are Canada goose, great crested grebe and osprey. Waders such as the Eurasian oystercatcher, northern lapwing and Eurasian curlew are commonly recorded, as too are grey heron, common kingfisher and white-throated dipper, especially in the streams that run into the loch. The shoreline vegetation and woods of Hillend Loch also provides shelter for the nests of the reed bunting and warblers, woodpeckers and owls. Mammals which are regularly recorded include the roe deer, Eurasian otter and the brown hare The diverse habitat around the loch provides homes for a wide variety of moths and butterflies, some of which are rather rare.

The school has an open admission system. Management principles The school uses long school days, analyzes individual test results carefully, and splits students into groups of ability within each classroom. Cindy Chang of the Times Picayune said that these methods are \\"not uncommon elsewhere.\\" The school gives constant boosts of self-esteem to students in order to replicate boosts of self-esteem that wealthier children get in their houses, and it also gives individual attention to students; Chang said that these methods \\"se[t] the school apart\\". Chang said that the school \\"dole[s] out liberally\\" positive reinforcement for academic achievement and also \\"qualities like helping others,\\" and that the praise, given on a daily basis from teachers, and the \\"celebration\\" assembly, held every week, \\"convince students that they can be the first in their families to go to college, if only they work hard.\\" Wendy Kopp of The Atlantic said that, at the school, there is \\"required rigorous coursework, an intense culture of character-building, and an all-out effort by teachers[...]\\"Kopp, Wendy. \\"How Micromanaging Educators Stifles Reform.\\" The Atlantic.

The school hosts weekly seminars on the importance of using formal speech and what clothes one should wear to a job interview. Chang says that the school also discusses plans to attend universities in an \\"unrelenting\\" manner. The school assigns individual groups of students to a faculty member for all four years as part of its \\"advisory\\" system. Chang said that the system \\"ensures that each child has a surrogate parent at the school and helps to inculcate the values and behavioral norms associated with the college-bound upper middle class.\\" Marcovitz said that the most successful teachers, during their first years, work 12 hours per day, for six hours per week.Hacker, Holly K. \\"Charters give education in New Orleans a fresh start.\\" The Dallas Morning News.

As of March 2008 the school's location had not yet been decided, but possible locations were East New Orleans and Gentilly. The school was originally named New Orleans Charter Science and Mathematics Academy which was similar to another New Orleans high school, New Orleans Charter Science and Mathematics High School (SciHigh).

Retrieved on August 3, 2012. Alternate , Archive He also previously taught at Saint Mary's Academy. Originally the school used a standard curriculum for a 9th grade level in American schools. It later concluded that its students needed to develop additional reading skills, so it added a literacy program, and according to principal Ben Marcovitz, the curriculum \\"basically changed over a weekend.\\" The school stopped assigning students to read novels such as Lord of the Flies, and began extra grammar and writing classes. The school offered courses in fluency and phonics. In 2008-2009, the average 9th grader had a 4th grade reading level. Average reading levels improved by 3.5 grades in the span of less than one year. At that point, the school's scores ranked as the third best in New Orleans and the best in the Recovery School District for Louisiana state English language arts examinations. Between 2009 and 2010 the School Performance Score increased by 7.6 points. In the 2009-2010 school year the school had the highest Graduate Exit Exam (GEE) scores in the RSD and the third highest in the city; two academically selective schools, Benjamin Franklin High School and Lusher Charter School, received higher GEE scores. 80% of the Sci Academy students received \\"basic\\" or higher in the English language arts section. 88% scored \\"basic\\" or higher in mathematics. 43% achieved \\"advanced\\" or \\"mastery\\" in mathematics. 19% of the students each at Walter L. Cohen High School and John McDonogh Senior High School received \\"basic\\" or higher in the English language arts section.. In 2010 Sci Academy was the highest performing non-selective public high school in New Orleans. During 2010, most teachers were young White Americans who are not from Louisiana. Most teachers were in their 20s or their early 30s and many had served in Teach for America, and many had graduated from prestigious universities such as Harvard University, University of California Berkeley, and Yale University.

As of November 2010 almost 90% of students were eligible. During the same period, special needs students made up 15-20% of the students at Sci Academy, while the New Orleans public school average was 12%. In 2010, despite an increase in the school's reputation, it had not experienced having a waiting list or finding an increase in academic ability in incoming freshmen. As of early November 2010, the school had remaining openings for ninth grade students. Cindy Chang of the Times Picayune said \\"Administrators quickly refute the notion that they are \\"creaming\\" the top students and denying admission to others\\" and that the school says that it takes \\"anyone who comes through the door [...] including special-needs students\\". In November 2010, the school had 225 students in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades. As of 2010, the majority of students are from Eastern New Orleans and Gentilly. The school has students from other areas in New Orleans. Residents of New Orleans, post-Hurricane Katrina, can choose schools regardless of where they live in the city. Also in November 2010, Cindy Chang of the Times Picayune said \\"As a rule, students do not enter Sci Academy any better-prepared than their counterparts at Carver, Clark, Cohen, John McDonogh or Sarah T. Reed. Most are tragically behind, with years of catching up to do in the 20-month span before they sit for the GEE.\\" As of the same year, the incoming freshmen came to school with even fewer academic skills than the school's first class of incoming freshmen. 41% of incoming freshmen, a plurality, had the reading levels of fourth grade or below, and 9% had first grade reading levels. 41% had reading levels from the fifth grade to the eighth grade levels, and 8% of students read at grade level or above. Chang added that \\"Students bring with them the same set of social ills -- single- parent homes, violence-plagued neighborhoods, poverty-related health problems -- found at other urban high schools.\\" Cindy Chang of the Times Picayune also said that \\"teenagers sit bolt upright in their seats -- no surreptitious napping here -- and getting good grades is considered cool.\\" According to Macovitz, as paraphrased by Chang, fights become more infrequent \\"once the faculty convinces new students that they are safe at school and do not need to prove their toughness.\\" Campus At its founding, the school was located in a set of modular buildings on Dwyer Road.

Another expansion of the yard was opened in 2008. This not only increased the absolute number of trains that could be stored at the end of the line, but also reduced the number of relay movements needed to position trains at the correct platform at the Trenton Transit Center.

The school is currently known as Thorildskolan. It was the first reported school shooting in Sweden and one of the earliest in Europe. Seven youngsters were wounded by 15 bullets fired by the perpetrator and one died from his wounds. The memory of the murdered Per H√•kan Altvall is kept alive in Kung√§lv via a stipend \\"awarded annually to one or a number of students known for good friendship and social support to students\\".  Incident  Around 11:30 p.m. on March 4, 1961, a large group of youngsters were dancing in the school gym hall. During the last dance, 17-year-old Ove Conry Andersson entered, pulled out a gun and started shooting randomly. People attempted to hide under chairs and behind a piano. Seven were wounded, including 18-year-old Per H√•kan Altvall, who later died from his wounds. He was hit in the stomach and an eyewitness states that the perpetrator first shot Altvall in the leg and later on his way out shot him again in the stomach, killing him. The wounded were first taken to a classroom in the school and later to Kung√§lv hospital. Kung√§lv police chased the gunman all night on the road to Ytterby, where it was assumed he had escaped. Kung√§lv police requested assistance from police in both Ytterby and Gothenburg. The following morning, March 5, just before 8 a.m., the killer showed up at the police station, driven there by an older coworker. A few hours later, the 17-year-old gunman had willingly told the police all his details of the incident. The shooter had been to a different party earlier and drank two mixed drinks, then watched an ice hockey game while drinking cognac with a friend. At 10.30 p.m. he first entered the school dance and got into a fight with a guest who was also an amateur boxer. Andersson then went to get his gun, came back and started shooting, killing Altvall before escaping and hiding in the Fontin forest. The chase for Andersson was the largest police activity in west Sweden to date, involving a total of 50 policemen plus dogs. On March 6, all of the school gathered in the gym hall in memory of Per Altvall. Perpetrator Andersson was known in Kung√§lv for his interest in cowboy movies and told the police he wanted to be like heroes in the movies. This event led to the first proposal to the government to investigate the effects of media violence, and the then-popular radio show \\"Tidsspegeln\\" (Mirror of Time) held a debate about \\"ideals and heroes for the youth\\" with the headline \\"Can we blame Cartwrights\\". A 1995 article in Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that Andersson was considered mentally unbalanced, partly because of the effects of alcohol, at the time of the shooting, and sentenced to closed psychiatric treatment. He refused to comment but DN mentioned that \\"it is known that he had married and had children less than four years after the incident.\\" Altvall's mother Essie, then 88, was also interviewed and mentioned that she reached out to Andersson's mother shortly after the shooting and had forgiven the shooter for the murder of her son. Andersson committed suicide on 12 August 2008.

The concept study was first unveiled at the 2011 Paris Air Show.IISS Experts' Commentary - From the Paris Air Show: Enter Perseus CVS401 Perseus is primarily a supersonic surface-launched and submarine- launched cruise missile concept built around an advanced, agile and stealthy airframe.MBDA Systems A joint Anglo-French project has been launched to develop the missile system formally called Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon (FC/ASW) with the aim of replacing the British Harpoon and French Exocet by 2030. Perseus was just a concept study by 10 engineers working on the design for six months. Characteristics MBDA describes the missile concept as a \\"unique multi-role, multi-platform weapon system\\" to be integrated on all major weapon platforms such as; warships, submarines, aircraft and land-based platforms. The stealthy Perseus missile concept is planned to have capabilities similar to Brahmos, with a range of 300 km reaching speeds of Mach 5. It is powered by a ramjet motor. The missile is 5 metres in length and weighs around 800 kg, with a payload comprising one 200 kg main and two 50 kg subsidiary warheads that can either directly contribute to the overall terminal or be ejected from lateral bays before the missile reaches its target, in effect acting as submunitions. This unique feature allows a single Perseus to either strike several targets in the same general area or to strike a single large target (such as an aircraft carrier) in several different areas simultaneously, with the aim of maximising damage. \\"In this case, a linear attack pattern could be selected, munitions striking the forward, centre and aft sections simultaneously. If a unitary blast is required, then the effectors remain on board the parent missile to add their blast effect to the central warhead.\\" Two types of attack profiles are envisaged: a high-altitude approach, for engaging land based targets; and a sea-skimming low-altitude approach terminating in a 'pop-up' engagement when dealing with surface threats like enemy warships. The missiles \\"skimming the sea at wave top\\" followed by a pop-up maneuver would only allow an estimated 3 second response time for enemy warships. The missiles concept sensor suite includes; * A multi-mode active e-scan radar with synthetic aperture radar and Doppler beam sharpening. * A laser radar (lidar) for terminal phase imaging and target recognition. The missile also features a \\"semi-active laser guidance capability.\\" MBDA believes that this guidance method will remain important for time-sensitive targeting for many years to come. Satellite datalink is to be incorporated for in-flight re-targeting, using thin-profile, low-observable active antenna arrays.\\" The missile will be VLS launched and is compatible with the American Mark 41 Vertical Launching System (to be fitted on the Royal Navy's Type 26 frigates) and the French A70 Sylver VLS (currently fitted on the FREMM of the French navy). Potential operators ; France * French Air Force * French Navy ; United Kingdom * Royal Air Force * Royal Navy In the 2016 UK‚ÄìFrance Security Summit, the two parties pledged to work on a \\"joint concept phase for the FC/ASW programme to identify solutions for replacement of the Scalp/Storm Shadow missiles for both countries, Harpoon for the UK and Exocet for France.\\" In the 2018 United Kingdom-France Summit, the FC/ASW programme was further affirmed.

Plot The average world of an average man turns upside down when he is arrested as the prime suspect in a series of rapes and robberies. In a gripping tale, professional photographer Jim Anderson (Tim Matheson) becomes trapped in a web of circumstantial evidence. After a zealous policeman arrests Anderson for indecent exposure for urinating during his morning run, he is soon fingered by witnesses as the criminal in relation to the rapes and robberies, despite his innocence. For the next 14 months, his life is hell. The case against him is so strong and his resemblance to the criminal is so exact, he begins to question his own innocence. Wrongly-accused and suffering the growing suspicions of his loyal wife (Mimi Kuzyk), Anderson begins to crack under the strain of clearing his name. He is forced to endure the ruthlessness of a police and legal system that becomes convinced that they have the right man. It also examines the personal impact that comes from such an assault. Too much circumstantial evidence surrounds the case, and too much information leaks out to the public; even if Anderson beats the rap, he'll be ruined in his community. Police Officer Kramer (Tom Atkins) is determined to bring him to justice, whilst Carolyn Shetland (Lisa Eichhorn) is Anderson's defense attorney.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090745/plotsummary Cast * Tim Matheson as Jim Anderson * Mimi Kuzyk as Cathy Anderson * Philip Charles MacKenzie as John Pierson * Lisa Eichhorn as Carolyn Shetland * Tom Atkins as Kramer * John Kellogg as Jim's father * David Froman as Pike * Anne Haney as Jim's mother * Linda Thorson as Pamela * Marilyn Lightstone as Dr. Lathrop * John M.

He was the son of Italian conductor Domenico Liberali and one of Nikolaos Mantzaros' favorite students. He later continued his studies at the Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella in Naples. When he returned to Corfu he was joyfully received into the circle of national composers, where he was considered a musician of great talent. He then began working as assistant to his teacher Mantzaros, who left him very little time for his own compositions. He was among the first teachers of his younger brother Iosif and served as vice director of music to the Philharmonic Society of Corfu. Liveralis' compositions are largely limited to minor forms. He wrote a series of fixed funeral marches, which were later published in two volumes. The march O Kambouris (Œü ŒöŒ±ŒºœÄŒøœçœÅŒ∑œÇ, 'The Hunchback') achieved great popularity in Corfu. He also devoted himself to composing piano music and to the creation of a rich song repertoire. His one-act opera is the only sure finished work for the stage by the composer.

Giraffes are herd animals with an extremely flexible social system.Bercovitch, Fred B., and Philip SM Berry. \\"Ecological determinants of herd size in the Thornicroft‚Äôs giraffe of Zambia.\\" African Journal of Ecology 48.4 (2010): 962-971. Diet The Rhodesian giraffe family browsing at the South Luangwa National Park, Zambia Giraffes are exclusively browsers that primarily feed on leaves and shoots of trees and shrubs. Giraffes consume deciduous plants in the wet season and transition to evergreen and semi- evergreen species in the dry season. They choose flowers, fruits, and pods when they are available. They are true ruminants with fore stomach fermentation. Their food intake is approximately 2.1% of the body mass of females and 1.6% for males. They obtain their water through the foliage they consume, but drink regularly when water is available. Giraffes seek out acacia species when browsing. Their feeding stimulates shoot production of the species.Owen-Smith, R. Norman. Megaherbivores: the influence of very large body size on ecology. Cambridge University Press, 1992. Reproduction The Rhodesian giraffes breed throughout the year. They reach sexual maturity at approximately six years, and then produce offspring approximately every 677 days. About half of all calves die before one year of age, due to predation. Giraffes can become pregnant while lactating, a very unusual characteristic.Bercovitch, Fred B., and Philip SM Berry. \\"Reproductive life history of Thornicroft‚Äôs giraffe in Zambia.\\" African journal of ecology 48.2 (2010): 535‚Äì538.

Based on Lombok island (approx 60 miles east of Bali island) the institute received its educational accreditation as a flight academy from Directorate General of Civil Aviation of Indonesia in 2010. The institute operates from Selaparang Airport in Mataram. History LIFT was established in June 2010 in cooperation with a private investor, Edmond Fung, from Hong Kong and a local management from Jakarta. LIFT was the first flight training facility in Indonesia to operate glass cockpit Liberty XL2 aircraft. The first training flight was made in December 2010. LIFT has aviation business roots in Indonesia dating to 2005, with the establishment of PT Sky Aviation, a small charter company, which was providing inter-island VIP charter service using US-built Cirrus SR22 aircraft. The operation was housed in the same hangar as the current company's flight operations base. In 2010, the investment company decided to move to a more profitable flight training sector of aviation business and sold PT Sky Aviation to a local Indonesian investment firm while establishing Lombok Institute of Fight Technology. In the short history of the school's existence, there has been 2 fatalities to date involving a former chief flight instructor and a student. The aircraft involved with this accident was PK- LLC.http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/sporean-missing-near-indonesian-island- we-had-glimmer-hope-it-was-not-our-friend This accident has been attributed to chronic poor maintenance issues due to fuel contamination, a negligent management team and hazardous training standards.https://www.pprune.org/south- asia-far-east/507677-unsafe-operation-lombok-institute-flight-technology- lift.html The institute is participating in the Liberty XL2 aircraft type certification research. Facilities The fight training campus is located in Senggigi resort area on the island of Lombok, West Nusa Tengara in Indonesia. A satellite campus (academics only) is located in Serpong, Tangerang, in West Jakarta Satellite facilities are located in Selaparang International Airport, in Lombok International Airport, Nusa Alam in Jakarta and Sumbawa Besar Regional Airport in Sumbawa LIFT purchased its first fleet of six Liberty XL2 flight training aircraft from Liberty Aerospace Corporation in Melbourne, Florida, in 2010 and shipped them to Johor Bahru to be later ferried to Lombok. It owns and operates five Liberty XL2 aircraft, both Classic and Vingard editions. The flight simulation department houses two full-motion flight simulators capable of semi-realistic reproduction of flight in Liberty XL2 aircraft. Criticism and Scandals In the short history of the school, there has been numerous criticisms on how the school managed its training standards and maintaining its fleet of five Liberty XL2s. Expat pilots who used to work in this institution in the early years were quickly fired due to them raising questionable concerns on the maintenance standards of the airplanes and refusing to fly.http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/01/30/fired-foreign-flyboys-cry- foul-lombok-flight-school.html Lawsuits and legality issues were raised between the foreign flight instructors and the management team. This constant internal struggle between the two sides eventually attributed to the dismissal of all foreign instructors and now the school only hire locally rated flight instructors. Fatalities On 31 October 2014, the chief flight instructor of the school, 30 year old Singaporean Lua Boon Huan, and a local Indonesian student pilot, 26 year old Jati Wikanto, went on a cross country flight from Lombok to Sumbawa using the Liberty XL2 with the call sign PK-LLC. However, after missing to appear at the local airport, local authorities were alerted and a search and rescue team was dispatched. The missing airplane was found near Moyo Island, West Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia. A fire extinguisher of the plane was found in the waters surrounding the island. Both occupants were presumed to be dead. Parts of the airplane that were found were disintegrated into tiny pieces, indicating that the nature of the crash was a high speed collision with the water. It was highly unlikely that this accident was a deliberate act by either pilots, but concluded as an unintentional out of control situation that led to their demise. There were many speculations as to what happened to PK-LLC, but according to numerous sources, it points to the highly probable scenario where the airplane's engine quit due to issues with fuel contamination which caused the pilots to panic and put the airplane in an unusual attitude. The unusual attitude could be one that was to either steeply bank the airplane back to the airport or a stall the aircraft, which eventually caused the airplane to spin and plummet to towards the water at a high speed. Prior to this accident, there were numerous red flags within the school among expat pilots that the airplane had a strong tendency to fall into a spin under full stall or full departure stall procedures. The manufacturer, Liberty Aerospace, itself has stated explicitly that this airplane is not spin approved. Financials The school has faced numerous financial backlashes due to expat pilots demanding money from successful lawsuits against the company. The school's student population have hugely fluctuated in the early years, with many of them demanding money back for not being able to progress in their flight career. The logistics of the school has been hampered due to the relocation of Lombok International airport, requiring students to travel over an hour from home base, Mataram, to fly. The student population has plummeted from 40 to 10 full-time students in the span of 5 years since the commencement of its operation, creating a further strain on the school's financials. However, the school's financials has been constantly backed by its majority owner and shareholder, Edmond Fung, over the last couple years using money inherited from his parent's trust fund based in Hong Kong and China. Academics The institute offers professional pilots courses in the following areas of aeronautical theory: *Basic Aerodynamics *Advanced Aerodynamics *General Navigation *Radio Navigation *Meteorology *Aircraft Systems *Instrumentation & Electronics *Radio Theory *Operational Procedures *Aircraft Weight & Balance Faculty and staff Key persons in the flight department in 2012 are Chief Flight Instructor Russell Sherwood.

Example of how motiongrams can be used in a comparative study of dancers' movements (40 seconds). A motiongram is a spatiotemporal display of motion, created from a video recording. Motiongrams are created using a video processing technique, in which a motion image is collapsed into a series of 1 pixel wide stripes and plotted next to one another.  Challenge  The traditional way of representing (human) motion visually, is either by displaying individual frames from a video file as a keyframe display or by doing one or more forms of feature extraction and subsequent plotting of the resultant data. Neither of these are ideal to give a good impression of the actual motion happening in the sequence. Keyframe displays only show postures and not motion, while feature graphs often rely on multiple analysis steps. Motiongrams are useful as an intermediary step to show spatiotemporal information of a movement sequence, but with no need for doing a full analysis of the data.  History  The term motiongram was first proposed by Alexander Refsum Jensenius in 2006, and the technique has later been refined by him and others. The technique was inspired by the pioneering work of Muybridge and Marey from the 19th century, as well as the slit-scan community in the 20th century. Motiongrams resemble slit-scan photographs, but are different in that they are created from frame-differenced motion-images. The result is that only motion is shown in the final display.  Implementation  An overview of creating a motiongram is shown in Figure 1. The process starts by reading a video stream, and doing simple image adjustments, e.g., changing the brightness and contrast. The next step involves producing the motion image by calculating the absolute frame difference between successive video frames, followed by applying some noise removal algorithms. The motiongram is created by calculating the normalized mean value for each row or column in the motion image. This means that for each image matrix of size MxN, a Mx1 or 1xN matrix is calculated. Drawing these 1 pixel wide ‚Äústripes‚Äù next to each other over time results in the final motiongram. The motiongram technique has been implemented as modules in the open framework Jamoma for Max, as well as for the EyesWeb platform and in Matlab. There are also two standalone applications for OSX and Windows: VideoAnalysis (non-realtime) and AudioVideoAnalysis (realtime).  Examples  Motiongrams allow for quick navigation in video material and for comparative analysis of motion qualities. Although quite rough, it is easy to see differences in the quantity of motion and similarities in upward/downward patterns between motion sequences.  Limitations  Since motiongrams are made by averaging over either the rows or columns of a video file, only one dimension will be shown in the final motiongram. Thus a horizontal motiongram will mainly represent vertical motion, while a vertical motiongram will mainly represent horizontal motion.

Description This species is an annual grass growing up to tall. The usually folded leaves are up to long. The seed heads are rounded or fan-shaped and are accompanied by leaflike bracts. The grass becomes orange, red, or golden brown at maturity. The clustered spikelets in the seed heads have some tubercle-based hairs and twisted awns, which can be up to 5 centimeters long. The awn is hygroscopic, twisting when moist and drilling the seed into the soil. This species is similar to Themeda triandra, a native species which tends to be smaller and more brown in color. Grader grass is a prolific producer of seed; there can be up to 1000 seeds in a single seed head.Grader Grass management guide. NQ Dry Tropics, Northern Gulf Resource Management Group and Southern Gulf Catchments. Retrieved August 9, 2012. The seed is dispersed by graders, on fur and clothing, and as a contaminant of pasture seed supplies. The seed is sometimes found as a contaminant of bird seed, as well. Invasiveness This grass is a major noxious weed in parts of Australia, where it was introduced in the 1930s. It may have arrived in supplies of straw packing. The plant was first recorded in Australia in September 1935 near Habana in the Mackay Region of Queensland. It then spread as a contaminant of seed. The weed easily invades ecosystems, displacing native vegetation. It grows quickly, producing flowers within 5 to 6 weeks after germination, and seed within 10 weeks. Flowering generally occurs in February to June in Australia. Germination can occur throughout the year, however, given adequate moisture. The grass easily colonizes disturbed areas such as roadsides. While the grass is cultivated for animal fodder in India, it is unpalatable throughout most of the year in Australia, forming wide monotypic stands that displace palatable grasses. It also forms a heavy fuel load, increasing the likelihood of fire. The species is also invasive in New Caledonia.

During normal embryonic development, the aortic arch is formed by the left fourth aortic arch and the left dorsal aorta. In people with a right-sided aortic arch, instead the right dorsal aorta persists and the distal left aorta disappears. Symptoms A right- sided aortic arch does not cause symptoms on itself, and the overwhelming majority of people with the right-sided arch have no other symptoms. However when it is accompanied by other vascular abnormalities, it may form a vascular ring, causing symptoms due to compression of the trachea and/or esophagus. Pathophysiology The causes of right-sided aortic arch are still unknown, 22q11 deletions have been found in some people with this condition. It has also been found in association with other genetic syndromes such as Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Diagnosis During pregnancy, prenatal ultrasound may reveal the abnormal course of the arch and this is the most common reason for identification of a right sided aortic arch nowadays. Sometimes, when a right sided aortic arch is seen before birth, it can actually be a double aortic arch, sometimes a fetal MRI scan may be helpful if the ultrasound is not clear.https://spotlight.kcl.ac.uk/2017/07/12/images-foetal-heart-3d/ After birth, a right-sided aortic arch is visualized on chest radiography, by the aortic knob (the prominent shadow of the aortic arch) that is located right from the sternum instead of left. Complex lesions are often assessed by MRI or CT. =Classification= Several types of right-sided aortic arch exist, the most common ones being right-sided aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery and the mirror-image type. The variant with aberrant left subclavian artery is associated with congenital heart disease in only a small minority of affected people. The mirror-image type of right aortic arch is very strongly associated with congenital heart disease, in most cases tetralogy of Fallot. Management If a right aortic arch is associated with a left sided arterial ductal ligament (a remnant from the foetal circulation which forms a ligament after birth) then a vascular ring is formed around the trachea. Studies show that around 1:4 children show symptoms of a vascular ring.Fetuses with right aortic arch: a multicenter cohort study and meta-analysis. D'Antonio F, Khalil A, Zidere V, Carvalho JS. Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol. 2016 Apr;47(4):423-32. doi: 10.1002/uog.15805. Epub 2016 Mar 16. Review. This requires further investigation by specialists. Many children are well. There is evidence to show that symptoms of a vascular ring do not correlate with the appearance of the trachea in these patients so further assessment may be required.

Epub 2018 Jan 6.This could be in the form of a specialist CT scan which is timed with inspiration and expiration or a free breathing bronchoscopy. If required, repairing a vascular ring formed by a right sided aortic arch usually involves dividing the left sided arterial ductal ligament (this is not a structure that is necessary for the heart circulation as it is not a vessel after birth). This is usually performed by cardiothoracic surgeons from the side of the chest (thoracotomy incision) and does not require the heart to be stopped like many heart surgeries. Some people may have an aberrant left subclavian artery (the artery to the left arm) and this may also require re-implantation as it adds to the complexity of the vascular ring.

He has written several books and his science essays have appeared at magazines such as BBC Wildlife Magazine, Scientific American, Smithsonian Magazine, National Geographic and others. He is quickly becoming known for efforts to involve the public as citizen scientists in arthropod surveys and bacterial flora studies. His projects include studies of belly button biodiversity, mites that live on human faces, ants in backyards, and fungi and bacteria in houses.Current Biology, \\"Q&A;\\", Volume 25, Issue 6, pages R212‚ÄìR214, 16 March 2015 He was a Fulbright fellow in Australia. Biography Dunn grew up in the then rural town of Hartland, Michigan. Growing up, Dunn spent much of his time outdoors catching snakes, fish and turtles. The basement of his house was filled with these animals which sometimes escaped, only to reappear much later under a pillow or climbing up the steps. Dunn earned a BA in Biology from Kalamazoo College in 1997. While at Kalamazoo College Dunn traveled to Ecuador. There, he and a friend were attacked by monkeys. In Ecuador, Dunn also lived in a small wooden shack beside a river in a forest called Guajalito in the . There, he sometimes ate dinner with an old Czech woman who had migrated to Ecuador during World War II. A river flowed behind the shack and up in the hills around the shack spectacled bears were common. While at the shack, Dunn conducted a study on epiphytic bromeliads that live on trees. Parts of the study were successful, but Dunn's attempt to also study what lived in the bromeliads failed when horses came to the shack at night and ate the bromeliads. Dunn obtained a PhD in Ecology and Evolution from the University of Connecticut in 2003. At the University of Connecticut, Dunn studied the recovery of tropical forests in Costa Rica, Peru and Bolivia after clear- cutting and use for traditional agriculture. He sought to understand how long it takes for the biodiversity of animals to return to regenerating forests. While studying this, Dunn learned that he knew less about the rain forest than the average eight-year-old Amazonian kid, as appears to remain true. Upon finishing his PhD, he became a Fulbright fellow at Curtin University in Australia where he worked with Jonathan Majer and Byron Lamont to study the dispersal of seeds. In Australia, many thousands of rare and interesting plant species have seeds dispersed by ants. The seeds produce a small fruit (an elaiosome) that the ants use to carry them back to their nests. They then feed the fruit to their babies and the seed itself germinates in the ants' garbage much the way that papaya seeds grow out of human latrines throughout the tropics. These seeds also sometimes travel much longer distances in the guts of birds. Dunn worked with other scientists to show that emus can carry seeds, even those that have evolved to be carried by ants, great distances across Australia. In Australia, Dunn was also kicked by a kangaroo.http://www.robrdunn.com/2011/12/a-kick-in-the-pants-2/ After his Fulbright fellowship, Dunn was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville for one year. In Knoxville, Dunn worked with Nate Sanders and studied the biodiversity of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which he later wrote about in his book Every Living Thing. Dunn and Sanders continue to do research together and co-founded the global ant collaboration, a large group of ant biologists all around the world who team up to study the global biology of ants. Dunn joined the faculty at North Carolina State University in 2005, first in the Zoology Department, then in Biology Department and now in the Biological Sciences Department. At North Carolina State University, Dunn began his second and third books. At North Carolina State University Dunn runs the yourwildlife.org program which aims to understand, while working with the public, the species that live around us in our daily lives.http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/07/11/4000568/nc-state-researchers- enlist-the.html He is now also the leader of the Students Discover project which aims to bring real science experiences to classrooms around the world.http://www.education.yourwildlife.org Dunn's work now includes studies of parasites of raccoons, bacteria in houses, ants in backyards, giant crickets that live in homes and the biodiversity of belly buttons. Meanwhile, Dunn's recent writing has considered the quest to find new superheavy elements, why men are bald, how modern chickens evolved, whether a virus can make you fat, the beauty of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the biology of insect eggs, the secret lives of cats, the theory of ecological medicine, why the way we think about calories is wrong, and why monkeys (and once upon a time, human women) tend to give birth at night.

The Cromona post office has operated since 1916. Cromona is actually known as Haymond by the local residents. However, for reasons that are obscure, the post office was given a different name, Cromona. It was built as a coal town in 1916, and was named for the president of the Elk Horn Coal Corporation, Thomas S. Haymond. The population of Haymond was 502 as of the 2010 census. Origins of the name Other locations in Eastern Kentucky have post offices with names different than that of the local towns. For example, the nearby town of Hemphill has a post office named Jackhorn. This was a common problem in the United States in the mid to late 19th century. In 1892, the United States Board on Geographic Names noted that the Post Office Department had \\"thousands of cases where the name of the post-office does not conform to the local name of the place.\\" Thousands of post office names were changed in the late 1890s in order to eliminate such confusion, but some examples of this have continued to present times. Even understanding the confusion surrounding post office names, one still has to ask, where did the name \\"Cromona\\" originate? Interviews of long-term residents offer no clear answer. The closest name is Cremona, Italy, where Stradivarius built his famous violins. Are there any connections between a city in Italy and a small town in rural Eastern Kentucky? The answer is, yes. In the early 20th century, many Italian stonemasons were working throughout Letcher County, building public buildings and churches, many of which still exist today.Cooper, Deborah Adams. Images of America: Letcher County. Arcadia Publishing, 2011. . So, perhaps the post office name was intended to honor these craftsmen. Geography Haymond is located at 37¬∞11‚Ä≤11‚Ä≥N 82¬∞41‚Ä≤50‚Ä≥W. Haymond is located in a narrow valley surrounded by mountains. Local terrain from the valley to mountaintops varies by over 1,000 feet. A small stream runs through Haymond, largely parallel to the main highway, SR-805. Haymond is bounded by Tollivertown on the west, and Potter's Fork on the east. Demographics According to the US Census of 2010, there were 502 people in Haymond. The population was 50.2% male and 49.8% female, with a median age of 43.0 years. Transportation SR-805 is a two-lane highway serving as the main road for the community. Newspapers The Letcher County Community New-Press is located in Haymond. Literary references Sarah Cornett-Hagen's book Still Point - Life Notes from a Kentucky Woman: A Coal Camp describes life growing up in Haymond.

Many residents of Four Corners consider the neighborhood to be a part of Silver Spring. The United States Census Bureau defines Four Corners as a distinct census-designated place (CDP). Prior to the 2010 U.S. Census, it was defined as a part of the Silver Spring CDP. Location Four Corners is bounded by Dennis Avenue to the northwest, the Sligo Creek Trail to the northeast, and Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway) to the south. It borders the neighborhoods of Woodmoor and Indian Spring Village, Franklin Knolls, Indian Spring Terrace, North Hills Sligo Park, and Burnt Mills Hills. The community of Northwood Park is also considered to be part of the Four Corners neighborhood, and is commonly known as Northwood-Four Corners or simply North Four Corners. Landmarks Located within Four Corners, Montgomery Blair High School (MBHS) is a public high school named after Montgomery Blair, the son of Francis Preston Blair, the founder of Silver Spring. Blair was a lawyer who represented Dred Scott in his United States Supreme Court case, and served as Postmaster General under President Abraham Lincoln. The school is nationally recognized for its magnet program and Communication Arts Program (CAP). The Polychrome Historic District is a national historic district in the Four Corners neighborhood. It recognizes a group of five houses built by John Joseph Earley in 1934 and 1935. The land that comprises North Four Corners Park was first acquired in the mid-1940s. It was a plot of land for temporary homes for the military during World War II. It was a white only neighborhood for a short while. The park grew in size to 14 acres in 1998. The park features a recreation building, playground, ballfields, tennis courts, and a picnic area. A number of historic homes exist in North Four Corners. These include the Silver Spring 1939 World‚Äôs Fair Home (House No. 15 in the 'Town of Tomorrow'), and the brick Tudor Revival Washington Gas Model Home that opened the 1938 building program in Northwood Park. History Burnt Mills Dam, Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River, Silver Spring, MD In the 1700s, a water mill was built at the easternmost corner of Four Corners, where today's Colesville Road passes over the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River and becomes Columbia Pike. The mill building burned down in 1788, hence the name Burnt Mills. Rebuilt in the late 1700s or early 1800s, ownership of the mill changed hands several times in the 19th Century before closing down in the early years of the 20th Century. The land was then donated to the Boy Scouts of America, who established a camp named for President Woodrow Wilson. In the early 1920s, the boy scouts donated part of the land to the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, and a temporary water filtration plant was erected at the site. Work on a new plant was completed in 1936, and the plant was named for the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission's chief engineer, Robert B. Morse Filtration Plant. The dam and the two Georgian Revival pump houses were acquired by the Maryland- National Capital Park and Planning Commission between 1996 and 2000 and are now on the Historic Register. The Burnt Mills Dam parks (East and West) are a popular starting point for hikers of the Northwest Branch Trail, part of the Rachel Carson Greenway, whose northernmost section runs along the eastern and northern border of the neighborhood. In the 19th century, there was an agricultural community located at the crossroads on the Bladensburg and Colesville Roads. The community remained rural until the post-World War I building boom in suburban Montgomery County. Four Corners came into being as a residential neighborhood between the world wars, beginning in the late 1930s with the development of Northwood Park, Woodmoor, Indian Spring Village, Indian Spring Terrace, North Hills of Sligo Park, and Fairway. These subdivisions expanded between 1945 and 1955 even as new ones, such as Northwood and Franklin Knolls, were constructed. The single-family house subdivisions that soon surrounded Four Corners had winding streets that formed an irregular grid in between major roads. Four Corners was largely developed by the late 1950s. Transportation Four Corners is served by Metrobus numbers Z6, Z8, C2, and C4, as well as Ride On numbers 8, 9, and 19. Washington Metro service is available on the Red Line at the nearby Wheaton and Silver Spring stations. The Piney Branch Road station of the Purple Line will be built in nearby Long Branch at the intersection of University Boulevard and Piney Branch Road and is expected to be open to the public by 2023. Demographics As of the 2010 United States Census, the racial makeup of Four Corners was 67% White, 12.6% African American, 0% Native American or Alaska Native, 7.2% Asian, 0% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 4.1% mixed race. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 17.7% of the population. Non-Hispanic whites were 59.8% of the population.

Early years Abel Kegne (his birth name) was born at Fokou√©, near Bamendou in the MENOUA department of West Province, Cameroon in 1924. He came from a Bamil√©k√© background. He left home early and went to Dschang to live with Mathieu Yamdjeu, a friend of his father. He became a ball boy at the tennis club, and was noticed there and enrolled in school. He studied at Dschang, Bafang, Nkongsamba and then at the Nursing School in Ayos. UPC militant in Cameroon In 1947 Abel Kingu√© was working in a large store in Douala, where he met Robert Ekwalla. Both became militants in the Union des Syndicats Conf√©d√©r√©s du Cameroun (USCC). In April 1950 he left the store and joined the staff of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) at its first congress in Dschang. In 1951 at Nkongsamba he publicly denounced the political machinations of prince Ndoumbe Douala Manga Bell. He demonstrated that he had great skills as an orator, strong ideological convictions and a great capacity for work and organisation. He was re-elected vice-president of the UPC in September 1952 at its second congress in Es√©ka. He was also editor of the UPC organ the Voice of Cameroon. Abel Kingu√© was one of the founders of the Democratic Youth of Cameroon (Jeunesse D√©mocratique du Cameroun ‚Äì JDC). In December 1953 he represented the JDC at the United Nations. On his return, during his tour to report on his trip, he was attacked at Mbouroukou near Melong, severely wounded and left for dead. He recovered, and in April 1954 ran as a candidate for the Territorial Assembly of Cameroon (Assembl√©e Territoriale du Cameroun ‚Äì ATCAM). Despite his great popularity, the colonial administration declared that he was defeated. In April and May 1955 the UPC held a series of angry meetings, circulated pamphlets and organised strikes. On 18 April 1955 Kingu√©'s home, as well as those of the UPC leaders Ruben Um Nyob√© and Jacques Ngom, was ransacked and burned. On 25 May 1955 the police opened fire on demonstrators in Loum, Douala, Yaound√©, Ngamb√© and other places. The following night the police sacked and burned the UPC headquarters in Douala's New Bell quarter. There were perhaps 5,000 victims of the violence at the end of May. On 13 July 1955 the French government dissolved the UPC by decree. Most of the UPC leaders moved to Kumba in the British-administered Southern Cameroons to avoid being jailed by the colonial power. Exile and death On 28 January 1956 the UPC presented its position in a declaration to the international press signed by F√©lix-Roland Moumi√© (President), Ruben Um Nyob√© (Secretary General) and the two Vice-Presidents, Ernest Ouandi√© and Abel Kingu√©. They called for reunification of French- and British-administered areas as an independent state. Abel Kingu√© chaired a major meeting of the JDC on 8/9 November 1956 in Kumba. He was attacked and left for dead by French commandos who were trying to kill the leaders of the UPC. In July 1957, under pressure from the French, the British authorities in Southern Cameroon deported the leaders of the UPC to Khartoum, Sudan. They moved in turn to Cairo, Egypt, to Conakry, Guinea and finally to Accra, Ghana. Suffering from high blood pressure, Kingu√© led a quiet life while in exile. On 6 September 1962 the UPC leadership in exile met in Accra at Ndeh Ntumazah's house, and decided to exclude the \\"criminal clique of Woungly\\" from the administrative secretariat. At ten that evening, when the attendees were about to leave, a bomb exploded without causing any injury. The Ghana authorities were not amused and threw the entire UPC leadership in jail. In October they freed Massaga, Tchaptchet and Ntumazah, but kept Abel Kingu√© in prison. On 13 September 1962 the UPC organised its first Assembl√©e populaire sous maquis in Mungo, where the Revolutionary Committee was named. The committee was presided over by Ernest Ouandi√©. Other members were Abel Kingu√©, Michel Ndoh, Ndongo Diy√©, Osend√© Afana, Nicanor Njiawe and Woungly- Massaga. A two-headed leadership was theoretically in place, with Abel Kingu√© leading the exiles from Ghana and Ernest Ouandi√© in the maquis. The organisation functioned poorly due to communication problems and also to the Sino-Soviet split. The next year it split, with Abel Kingu√© and Osend√© Afana allied with Ntumazah and opposed to the other leaders. Abel Kingu√© remained imprisoned in Accra until July 1963. After being released, his medical condition steadily deteriorated, with complications that included behavioural disorders. While on a mission to Algiers his condition suddenly worsened. Ahmed Ben Bella, President of Algeria, arranged for him to be flown to Cairo for treatment, where he died on 16 April 1964. He was the only UPC leader who did not die a violent death.

It trains community-based organizations (CBOs) to meet high standards of effective and democratic governance, to establish a stable foundation for future growth, and to conduct rigorous human rights research and advocacy. It is an independent organization that places the needs of marginalized communities at the center of national, regional, and international policy making. Since its founding in 2006 by Sara L.M. Davis, the organization has opened offices in New York (United States), Beijing (China), and Bangkok (Thailand).  Focus on marginalized groups  Asia Catalyst works with community-based organizations (CBOs) from marginalized groups that work on the right to health. Its partners come from communities that often experience severe and systemic rights violations, and are unable to or unaware of how to conduct effective advocacy around these issues. Partner groups include people living with HIV (PLHIV) and Hepatitis, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, and people who use drugs. = Definition of a CBO = Asia Catalyst defines a community-based organization (CBO) as a civil society group that operates within a specific community or groups of communities. Asia Catalyst works only with CBOs that represent marginalized communities. It requires that partner organizations have at least one member of the marginalized community in a decision-making position within the organization. This is meant to \\"ensure that the voices of marginalized communities are heard, and that Asia Catalyst's work focuses on the real, and most pressing, rights violations experienced.\\" = Partner geography = Over the course of Asia Catalyst's history, it has partnered with hundreds of CBOs in 11 Asian countries, including Cambodia, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, Nepal, The Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and PNG.  Programs  Asia Catalyst supports civil society development and empowerment through tailored capacity building, research, and advocacy on issues of most concern to marginalized communities in Asia. Asia Catalyst uses an innovative, responsive model to \\"ensure community voice and need is at the heart of all programming.\\" It incorporates a training-of-trainers methodology into all long-term programs to ensure sustainability, and continuously evaluates and adjusts its program approach to maximize impact and quality. Asia Catalyst has four main program areas: CBO Catalyst, Regional Rights Training, tailored coaching, and advocacy. = CBO Catalyst = Asia Catalyst believes that community based organizations (CBOs) are best positioned to conduct their own advocacy as they have a unique understanding of the circumstances in which they work and the communities they represent. Asia Catalyst‚Äôs seminal program, the CBO Catalyst, is a capacity building program for CBO leaders from marginalized groups in Asia. Over the course of one year, Asia Catalyst convenes a group of CBO leaders for capacity building workshops that merge organizational management skills with rights-based advocacy. Participants form lasting coalitions and conduct effective advocacy on their communities‚Äô priority issues. = Regional Rights Training = Asia Catalyst's Regional Rights Training Program builds strong coalitions of like-minded CBOs through capacity building and implementation of human rights analysis, documentation and advocacy on a single thematic issues uniting CBOs across Asia. In 2015 Asia Catalyst was supporting 16 representatives from eight CBOs from Cambodia, China, Myanmar, and Viet Nam to work on ending discrimination in health care settings against people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the region. = Tailored coaching = Asia Catalyst provides specialized, issue-specific training to individual organizations and small groups with a specific skill-set need, such as strategic planning, fundraising, or volunteer management. Tailored Coaching for CBOs typically consist of two three-day workshops with Asia Catalyst over a period of 3‚Äì6 months. Between workshops, participant organizations complete assignments aimed at implementing the knowledge they have gained at workshops, with Asia Catalyst providing additional mentor support throughout the process. Tailored coaching focuses especially on groups from marginalized communities, such as sex workers, drug users, LGBT people, and people living with HIV/AIDS. Much of the work has focused on grassroots groups in the People‚Äôs Republic of China, as well as groups in Korea, Thailand, and Myanmar (Burma). Asia Catalyst‚Äôs approach uses tools that have been developed in the field with input from their marginalized groups, and helps each group to develop strategic plans, project timelines, budgets, and volunteer management systems. Once this foundation is established, groups may be assisted in developing rights documentation and advocacy projects, working on such issues as discrimination, criminalization and access to health services. Asia Catalyst trains groups to advocate with local and national officials, the United Nations, and to participate in international meetings. = Advocacy and research = Asia Catalyst partners with local groups in China to conduct qualitative research to document human rights abuses that affect the right to health. These reports draw on international human rights standards and local laws to make policy recommendations. Asia Catalyst‚Äôs advocacy work has focused on compensation for victims of the HIV blood disaster, as well as discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, and rights issues facing people who use drugs and sex workers. Advocacy projects have been successful in achieving media attention. Asia Catalyst's December 2013 report on Custody and Education, an arbitrary detention system for female sex workers in China, was featured on the front page of the New York Times, as well as in prominent Asian and international newspapers including The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, The South China Morning Post, and The Taipei Times. Its December 2014 research on the living conditions of transgender female sex workers in Beijing and Shanghai was also published in the LGBTQ Policy Journal at the Harvard Kennedy School.  Administration  = Leadership and board = Asia Catalyst is governed by a board of directors, which provides support and guidance for program direction and development. The board is led by Chair and Treasurer Yvonne Y. F. Chan, and includes Minky Worden of Human Rights Watch and Sara L.M. Davis, the organization's first executive director. Asia Catalyst's executive director is Charmain Mohamed, a respected and experienced human rights advocate and activist, who has lived and worked in Asia for most of 15 years. She has worked for the UN, Human Rights Watch and the Norwegian Refugee Council, both in emergency contexts and on long-term issues, in countries such as Indonesia, East Timor, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and, most recently in Palestine. She holds a Masters in Human Rights Law from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London and a BA (Hons.) in Southeast Asian Studies and Indonesian Language from the University of Hull. Charmain is fluent in English, Indonesian and Malay. = Funding = Asia Catalyst, a 501(c)3 registered charity in the United States, undergoes an independent audit annually and files information returns with various governmental regulatory agencies. The organization‚Äôs resources come from contributions from individuals, foundations, and government funding. Among its most significant past and present supporters are the Open Society Foundation, The Levi Strauss Foundation, National Endowment for Democracy, the Swedish International Development Agency, the German Embassy in Beijing, UNAIDS, and the U.S. State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

These water- soluble polymers are used as flocculants and coagulants in solid/water separation to recycle water, rheology modifiers and friction reducers. These functionalities have many uses where water is used, in drinking water production, wastewater treatment, mining, paper, enhanced oil recovery, hydraulic fracturing, agriculture, textile and cosmetics. The SNF Group comprises subsidiaries and joint ventures in over 40 countries and operates 21 production sites in Europe, Americas, Asia and Australia. Its headquarters is located in Andr√©zieux, France. SNF has customers in over 130 countries and supplies products to a wide variety of industries. SNF is one of the major chemical companies in France.http://www.verif.com/Hit-parade/01-CA/03-Par- activite/20-Industrie-chimique At the end of 2019, the company employed over 6,600 people for sales of 3.4 G‚Ç¨.  Business Segments  SNF‚Äôs products operate in a variety of markets. The driving factors of SNF‚Äôs growth are the scarcity of natural resources: water, oil and minerals. = Drinking water production = SNF manufactures and supplies organic coagulants such as PolyDADMAC and Polyamines as well as polyacrylamide flocculants and provides the polymer equipment and service required by the drinking water production plant. = Wastewater treatment = Wastewater treatment is SNF‚Äôs historical business. Polyacrylamide flocculants are used in the primary settlers as well as in the sludge dewatering stage. For industrial water treatment, SNF provides heavy metal chelatants, dispersants and scale inhibitors. = Oil = Polyacrylamides are used in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) to improve the speed and amount of oil extracted from the reservoir. The techniques used to improve oil recovery can be straightforward polymer flooding (PF), surfactant polymer flooding (SP) or alkaline surfactant polymer flooding (ASP). The latter technique, when applicable, has been known to sweep the reservoir of 90% of the oil in place.http://www.spe.org (Society of Petroleum Engineer Article on Alcaline Surfactant Polymer performance) = Gas (Tight Gas, Shale Gas, Coalbed Methane) = With the success of hydraulic fracturing, also referred to as slickwater fracturing, as a means of economically recovering unconventional gas reserves, use of polymeric friction reducers has become widespread. Polyacrylamides are used for their drag reducing properties on water to decrease frictional pressure losses, thereby maximizing bottom hole injection pressures allowing for a higher pressure from the same number of pump trucks. = Mining = In addition to coagulants, flocculants and dispersants, SNF produces also a range of mining reagents based on xanthate chemistry. The following as some of the markets served by SNF in mining and metallurgical applications: slurry solid/liquid separation, pelletization and briquetting, flotation of sulphides ores, reduction of scale deposits, viscosity modifiers for hydraulic transport, mining backfill and grinding, Dust control, environmental remediation and dredging. = Paper = Widely used by the paper Industry, polyacrylamides sold by SNF under the trademark FLORET are used as processing aids and applied on the wet end of a paper machine either alone or as a part of a multi-component system. They enhance productivity, retention and drainage. Coagulants act as fixative for various chemicals such as dyes and sizing agents, charge neutralization for pitch and cationic demand control. SNF also manufactures synthetic dry strength resins which are acrylamide based, glyoxalated (FLOSTRENGTH) or issued from Hofmann rearrangement. These resins, applied in the thick stock, imparts higher strength properties to paper & board, allows fiber substitution by lower quality grades or by fillers (PCC, GCC) . Productivity increases have been reported. = Agriculture = Polyacrylamide superabsorbents can absorb up to 400 times their weight in water, they are used for many applications such as reforestation, horticulture, landscaping and ornamentals. These products sold under the AQUASORB tradename, increase the water holding capacity of soils for several years, reduce irrigation time and water usage, and decrease water and nutrients losses linked to leaching. Soluble polyacrylamide polymers are used to flocculate the irrigated soil thus improving water penetration and soil aeration while diminishing soil erosion. = Textile = FLOPRINT textile thickeners are used in pigment, reactive and dispersed printing. They are available as standard inverse emulsions, dewatered inverse emulsions and powders. SNF also manufactures textile auxiliaries used as antimigrants, dispersants, sizing and fixing agents. = Cosmetics = SNF manufactures three types of cosmetic ingredients, conditioning agents, rheology modifiers and carbomers under the trademarks FLOCARE and FLOGEL. The first, known as Polyquaternium (Ingredient Profile: Polyquaternium-6) (Ingredient Profile‚ÄîPolyquaternium-7) 6, 7, 11 and 22. is used for hair conditioninghttp://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/sensory/126533328.html (Evaluating Hair Conditioning with Instrumental Combing) and body shampoos. They have an affinity for keratin thus protect, enhance and repair the hair fiber. Rheology modifiers are based on inverse emulsion thickening agentshttp://www.happi.com/articles/2010/11/recent-patent-applications-for- hair-care-polymers (Recent Patent Applications For Hair Care Polymers)http://www.happi.com/articles/2009/04/trends-in-polymers-for-skin- care (Trends in Polymers for Skin Care, Part I) for skin care formulations and hair combing creams. Carbomers, based on precipitation technology, are the most widely used thickening agents in the cosmetic industry. = Functional Solutions = SNF also manufactures specialty polymers such as FLOSET for the construction industry, FLOSPERSE as dispersants, FLOSOFT and FLOGEL in home care applications, METALSORB as heavy metal chelating agents and ODORFLO as odour control agents.  Production  SNF has always heavily invested in production facilities across the globe, as a result SNF has a total of 21 state-of-the-art production sites in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australia; with 7 major plants in Andr√©zieux, France ‚Äì Riceboro, Georgia, US ‚Äì Plaquemine, Louisiana, US ‚Äì Taixing and Rudong, China ‚Äì Ulsan, Korea and Vizag, India. In 2018 SNF's worldwide polymer production capacity is 1190 kt/y (active equivalent).  FAQ  SNF is not an acronym but just three letters that signify nothing.

He published the first volume in 1935 and the second before the start of the Second World War. After the war plans and outlines were drawn up for further volumes but due to illness he did not complete them. * the second series by Frank, Baron Freytag von Loringhoven (1910‚Äì1977) was a revision and continuation of Isenburg's work.

Suangporn grew up with her mother in the slums of Bangkok, Thailand after her father left the family. While growing up, Suangporn's mother made sure she went to school and became educated to get a career and avoid falling into prostitution when she got older. Suangporn learned English and Chinese, swimming, and computer skills in school. In her teens, she wanted to become an actress to help pay for her mother's medical bills and turned to an aunt who worked in Thai soap operas. Suangporn's aunt refused to help, so at age seventeen she became determined to become an actress independently. She found an agent who eventually helped her find a minor role in Paul Spurrier's film P. The actress who was originally supposed to play the main protagonist Aaw/Dau quit the production the same day Suangporn showed up to rehearse her two scenes. She asked to read for the lead role of Aaw/Dau by doing a scene in which the character weeps. She and won the part that day. Since Suangporn was still seventeen, some of her scenes with sexual content were toned down. She had no acting experience prior to this.Brief Suangporn Jaturaphut biography at the official website for the film \\"P\\" \\"The character of Dau appears in many scenes in the film, and so the filming hours were long and tough. Equally tough was the learning curve. Suangporn had no established acting tricks or techniques. If her performance was to work, it would have to be based on instinct and real emotion.\\"Quotation from the official website for the film \\"P\\" After the completion of the film, Suangporn gave all the money she earned to her mother to pay for a medical operation. The filmmakers assisted Suangporn in enrolling into the Assumption University, where she studied for a B.A. in Chinese for Business.

It contains six complete concerts, on 18 CDs‚Äîone concert from each venue of their spring 1990 tour. It was released on August 31, 2012. Spring 1990 was produced as a box set, with a limited edition of 9,000 individually numbered copies. The box includes a 60-page hardcover book of essays and photos, along with memorabilia such as reproductions of the tour program, ticket stubs, and backstage passes. Speaking of the album in a 2012 interview with Rolling Stone, Bob Weir said, \\"For my money, this was our hottest era. We couldn't wait to go on tour; we couldn't wait to play because it was really working for us and it was keeping us amused. We had been working together as a unit for a good length of time.... We got comfortable enough in those tunes so that we could do a little exploration, harmonically, rhythmically, whatever. We could go places with them. Everybody has to be way in tune with each other to be able to do that.\\" Looking back, Bill Kreutzmann said about the tour, \\"Brent played the best organ I‚Äôve ever heard anybody play. He had the piss and the vinegar in him and he brought it to the table every night. The band, as a whole, had come alive again. Those shows had energy, with thunderbolts of electricity to spare. We didn‚Äôt wreck drum sets or smash guitars or dress up in elaborate stage costumes; our shows were always about the music and the music during that period was adventurous. It dared listeners to ride shotgun as we went around hairpin turns, whizzing past ever-changing landscapes. Some nights, I could look out from my perch on the drum riser and see the whole house rocking back and forth in unison, a giant wave of people, and those were the nights you knew it was working.\\" A companion box set, Spring 1990 (The Other One), was released two years after Spring 1990.

The lighthouse is positioned west of the Rock of Gibraltar, on the Detached Mole at the north entrance to Gibraltar Harbour. History Gibraltar Harbour, also referred to as the Port of Gibraltar, is on the west side of Gibraltar, at latitude 36¬∫09'N, and longitude 5¬∫20'W. In addition to the protection provided to the harbour by the Rock of Gibraltar, there is a system of manmade defences. These include a trio of breakwaters: the North Mole (formerly the Commercial Mole) including its Western Arm, the Detached Mole, and the South Mole. The South Mole includes an extension which was added later, and was previously known as the New Mole and New Mole Extension. The harbour has both north and south entrances. The northern entry is bordered by the Western Arm of the North Mole and the Detached Mole. The southern entry is between the Detached Mole and the South Mole. The Gibraltar Detached Mole (\\"C\\" Head) Lighthouse is located at the north end of the Detached Mole of Gibraltar Harbour. It is positioned at the \\"C\\" Head of the Detached Mole. The lighthouse and harbour are to the north of the east end of the Strait of Gibraltar, the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, and west of the Rock. The Detached Mole (\\"C\\" Head) Lighthouse, like the \\"B\\" Head Lighthouse, comprises a square tower built of concrete, on piles, with a height of 37 feet. The light characteristic is a quick, flashing green light, and the range is 5 nautical miles. The focal plane of the light is 33 feet (10 metres). The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office Admiralty number for the lighthouse, originating in Volume D of the Admiralty List of Lights and Fog Signals, is D 2446.

Often described as diminutive, Maggs operated as a quick, skilful and creative forward. Club career Maggs joined Arsenal Ladies as a nine-year-old, after being spotted at an after school football course.

Thirty-one caches were excavated from the cave, but there is only one radiocarbon date of 1953¬±175 14C BP (~2000 years ago) from the cave, which suggests that Humboldt Cave may have only been a single cultural component. In other words, the caches from the cave may have only been deposited once and at the same time. Description Humboldt Cave is a dry cave which was first excavated by archeologists in 1936. The cave's environment preserved artifacts including fiber and skin garments, bags and mats. Other artifacts found in the cave have documented contact with cultures in what were in what is now Arizona and California. The cave was formed by vertical faulting in a cliff face, which was periodically flooded by Lake Lahontan. The flooding deposited tufa over the cave's surfaces, preserving them from erosion. The remains of the lake, now known as Humboldt Sink, are below the cave, away. The cave opening is about high and wide, widening to inside, with a depth of about . In addition to humans, the cave was also inhabited by bats, whose guano was to in depth on the cave's floor before excavation. Excavation Humboldt Cave was excavated in 1936 by Robert F. Heizer of the University of California, Berkeley. The Archaeology of Humboldt Cave, Churchill County, Nevada was not published until 1956. Heizer concluded that the remote location relative to the lake and marshes made Humboldt Cave a temporary refuge rather than a permanent residence. Initial stages of excavation concentrated on improving access by widening the cave's opening. The cave was surveyed and divide into twelve sections wide by the width of the cave for individual excavation. Sections were excavated in increments.Heizer, Kreiger, p. 7 Apart from fur, feather, bone, wood and horn that had been damaged by insects and rodents, artifacts were recovered in near-perfect condition.Heizer, Kreiger, p. 9 A total of about of deposits were removed from the cave. No significant evidence of distinct occupation levels was apparent. Heizer proposed that Humboldt Cave's occupants corresponded to those of the later or upper levels of Lovelock Cave. The cave had been occupied by pack rats, who filled any available space with gathered material, which included artifacts, particularly in a low hollowed space that the excavators called the \\"South Alcove.\\" Pack rats jumbled much of the material, as was illustrated when, during excavation, a wool sweater was left in the cave. Rats shredded the sweater and took the pieces into the alcove, where parts of sweater were recovered all the way to the solid cave floor during later excavation.Heizer, Kreiger, p. 10 Artifacts The most significant artifacts recovered during the excavation were usually found in one of 31 cache pits dug into the cave floor by the inhabitants. The pits were lined with worn-out baskets, pieces of baskets, or grass. Cache 13 in particular, called by excavators the \\"shaman's cache,\\" yielded a birdskin robe, pouches, waterfowl bones and skins, hawk feathers and a stuffed canvasback duck head. The robe was believed to have originally been feathered, the feathers having been extensively damaged by insects while buried. Heizer speculated that the cache's contents might have been curative tokens, or could simply have been used to make decoys.Heizer, Kreiger, pp. 11, 12 A number of shaped sickles fashioned from bighorn sheep horns were also recovered.Heizer, Kreiger, p. 15 Humboldt Cave was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 16, 1976. It was included due to its significance as a prehistoric archaeological site and for its importance as a training ground for students of archaeology.

The accident took place during a joint Romanian-Israeli aviation military exercise code-named \\"Blue Sky 2010\\". All on board the aircraft died: four Israeli pilots, two Israeli mechanics, and one Romanian liaison officer. The Romanian authorities sent police and security forces into the mountain the morning after the accident. In addition, Israel sent a large team to assist in the rescue operation. After an extensive search in the crash site, on 27 July 2010, the bodies were eventually found. An investigation into the incident concluded that the crash was most likely due to human error.  Background  In September 2003, an agreement was signed between the Romanian and Israeli Air Forces on cooperation and training, with the first training session being held in August 2004. This cooperation was important to the IAF, as Romania's geography includes high-altitude terrain and climate conditions that are different than those in Israel, and allows the IAF to practice special techniques and train in a different terrain. Another military exercise and cooperation agreement between Israel and Romania was signed in 2006, and was extended in 2009. On 18 July 2010, a joint exercise of the Israeli Air Force and Romanian Air Force began, in which Yasur helicopters from the 118 Squadron took part. This squadron, based at the Tel Nof air base, has participated in all of Israel's recent major operations and wars, mainly for transporting special forces into enemy territory. The exercise was known as Blue Sky 2010, which was supposed to last for 11 days, and in which the Romanian and Israeli troops practiced flying at low altitudes in difficult terrain for search-and-rescue missions and medical evacuations. The Yasour transport helicopter, (Sikorsky CH-53), is considered by Israel to be the most reliable aircraft of its kind in the IDF, and has been used for over 40 years. The aircraft was bought from the United States and integrated into the Israeli Air Force service in 1969. The aircraft is used by the IAF's 669 Search and Rescue team, and is also the IAF's main aircraft for transporting soldiers, as it can carry 35 soldiers with all of their equipment. In 2007, under a program called \\"Yasour 2025,\\" intended to extend the Yasour's life until 2025, the IAF installed over 20 new electronic systems, including, for the first time on helicopters, one for missile defense,  Accident  An IAF Sikorsky CH-53 Yas'ur helicopter, similar to the aircraft involved in the accident On 26 July 2010 at 1:15 P.M., two Yasur helicopters took off from the Romanian Air Force Base in Boboc and headed north toward the Carpathian mountains. The fog which prevailed at the flight altitude made it difficult to navigate. The two helicopters were flying in formation at a low altitude as part of the exercise. While over the Carpathian Mountains in Romania, one of the helicopters radioed that it had lost visual and radio contact with its counterpart. The Israeli Air Force confirmed that it lost contact with one of the helicopters. The helicopter had crashed at approximately 4:00 p.m. at an altitude of 2,246 m (7,369 ft).  Israeli and Romanian response  Initial reports over the loss of contact with the CH-53 helicopter were received in the Israeli Air Force headquarters at around 17:00 P.M. (Israeli time), and as a result, a gag order was issued in Israel over releasing information concerning the incident. The purpose of this gag order was so the IDF could personally contact and inform the families of the deceased, rather than having them hear about it through the media. Although initially the Israeli media did not report about accident, the Internet was quickly flooded with information about the accident. The Israeli media noted that despite the seniority of the IAF Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion Yas'ur helicopters, the helicopters were recently upgraded, both in terms of systems and in terms of technical care, as part of the \\"Yas'ur 2025\\" program aimed at having the Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters remain in service up until 2025. = Search and rescue = The IDF delegation search for the casualties from the helicopter crash in the Carpathian Mountains. A search-and-rescue unit was sent by Israel to Romania to assist in the rescue, and included approximately 80 personnel from the IDF Medical Corps, the IAF, the Oketz K-9 Unit, the 669 Airborne Rescue and Evacuation Unit, the Chief Military Rabbinate, search and rescue teams, the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, and an investigatory team to the crash site. Rescuers could not land near the crash site due to the rugged terrain, and had to either walk to the crash site on a difficult path or be lowered to the site by rope. In addition, the bad weather also made it tougher for search-and-rescue teams to identify and reach the crash site. The Romanian authorities declared the area around the crash site a closed military zone and sent police and security forces into the mountain the morning after the accident. On 27 July 2010, the Romanian Defense Ministry officially announced that 7 bodies were found, and that there were no survivors in the accident. Around midnight on 27 July 2010, the Romanian Army discovered the helicopter's black box. The Romanian troops sent a photo of the black box to the IDF, which confirmed that it was the actual black box of the helicopter. Israeli Air Force officials confirmed that Israel would investigate the black box. On 30 July, the IDF Chief Rabbi Brigadier-General Raphael Peretz confirmed that all the bodies were identified and that an IAF plane would take off to Israel with the six bodies during the morning hours of July 30.  Official reactions  : * On 27 July, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that \\"the tragedy is immense and that this is a difficult day for every Israeli\\" and that \\"today in pain, with a tight throat, we ask how could heroes fall from so high?\\" Prime Minister Netanyahu explained, \\"The IDF, its soldiers and commanders guarantee our existence. They stand between our tragic fate in exile, when we were defenseless against the most murderous impulses in history, and where we are today, with the power to defend ourselves from these evils... We fight while searching for those who seek peace.\\" Netanyahu also offered his support to the families of the victims and sent them a \\"hug\\" from the entire nation. * On 29 July, Israeli President Shimon Peres thanked Romanian President Traian Basescu for Romania's close cooperation regarding the crash. President Peres said that he \\"thanks him from the bottom of his heart, both personally and on behalf of the entire State of Israel, for his personal involvement, warmth he granted Israel and the positive attitude shown in everything related to the treatment of IDF soldiers who perished in the helicopter crash\\". Peres also conveyed his condolences for the death of the Romanian pilot killed in the crash. : * Romania's Defense Ministry announced that military bases across Romania would hold a memorial service in honor of the victims. Defense Minister Gabriel Oprea also conveyed his sorrow over the deaths, as well as his condolences to the families of the soldiers. * Romanian President Traian Basescu wrote a letter to Israeli President Shimon Peres, which conveyed his condolences to the families of the soldiers. Basescu said, \\"It is my wish to assure you that the Romanians fully identify with the people of Israel during these difficult times.\\"  Aftermath  A memorial ceremony for the fallen soldiers of the Yasur helicopter crash was held in Tel Nof Airbase, upon the victims' return to Israel. Seven months after the accident, Israel decided that the widow of the Romanian captain who was killed in an accident would be given the status of a \\"widow of the Israeli army\\", and as such she would be granted a monthly pension from the Israeli Defense Ministry. In addition, it was decided that a special fund would be opened for her baby which would include an initial fund of 20,000 dollars. = Funeral = Hundreds of Israelis attended the funeral services of the Israeli soldiers who were killed during the crash. The bodies were returned to Israel on an IAF plane which arrived at the Tel Nof airbase. At the funeral services, friends, families, and fellow soldiers eulogized the 6 soldiers who were killed in the crash. = Impact = All flight exercises were halted by IAF commander Maj. Gen. Ido Nechushtan for a day, in order to conduct safety inspections. The Romanian and Israeli military aviation commanders decided to collaborate in raising a memorial at the site of the crash. In 2011, the IAF announced that the Sikorsky CH-53 transport helicopters would return to Romania for training the following summer. In August 2011, the Israeli Air Force sent a Hercules squadron for joint-exercises in Romania, which marked the first time since the Sikorsky CH-53 crash that the IAF sent a squadron for training in Romania. However, Sikorsky squadrons did not take part in the joint-exercises. The joint-training lasted for two weeks. Cooperation between Israel and Romania increased following the crash, and Romanian Air Force Deputy Commander General Alexander Glushka said that \\"In the past year, the friendship between us has become a brotherhood. This cooperation is extremely important to us.\\" In February 2012, the Israel Air Force finished upgrading and rebuilding old Sikorsky 985 helicopters, and turned them into new Sikorsky 2025s. Much time was spent on the project after the Sikorsky CH-53 crash occurred. Israeli Warrant Officer Ziv, Officer of the Cargo Department in the Equipment Squadron, explained that this upgrade was made apparent following the Sikorsky CH-53 crash in Romania, and that \\"after many examinations it was concluded that the Sikorsky 985 is the most efficient aircraft for our unique project.\\" = Investigation = Immediately after learning of the accident the Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Ido Nehoshtan appointed an investigative team to look into the causes of the crash, headed by Brigadier-General Shlomo Mashiach. A short time after, Israeli Air Force officials requested that the Romanian Air Force would bring the remains of the helicopter back to Israel in order that the IDF would carry out a full investigation of the event. The investigation determined that the accident was most likely due to human error. = Memorials = On 12 August 2010, a memorial ceremony was held in the central synagogue of Bucharest in Romania, and was attended by representatives of the Romanian Jewish community, Romanian public figures, Israeli President Shimon Peres, and IAF Commander Maj. Gen. Ido Nechushtan. Hermina Darganah, the widow of Romanian Air Force Captain Stephen Claudius Darganah who was killed in the crash, also attended the memorial service, where Peres addressed her personally, saying, \\"We share the same feelings. You are just as dear to us as any Israeli friend who lost her loved one.\\" Peres' official visit was the first to Romania by an Israeli president. Nechushtan said: In September 2011, IAF chief Major General Ido Nehushtan led a service with his Romanian counterpart in memory of those killed during the crash. In addition, Israeli Air Force officers, representatives from the Israeli Defense Ministry, and IDF rabbinate officials attended the memorial, which took place in Romania. In November 2011, the Tel Nof base of the Israeli Air Force received an ancient 200-year-old Torah, one which had survived the Holocaust, as a donation from Romania's Jewish community in commemoration of the victims of the Sikorsky CH-53 crash. A special ceremony marked the occasion for the receiving of the scroll, which was found in Romania in the cellars of the previous Romanian leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu.

Hsiao (born 12 August 1958) is an American materials scientist and educator. He served as the Vice-President for Research and Chief Research Officer at Stony Brook University from May 2012 to December 2013. Education and career Born in Taipei, Taiwan, Hsiao attended the exclusive all-boys Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School (JGHS). He graduated from JGHS to enroll in the National Taiwan University and pursue a B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering. After graduating in 1980, Hsiao entered the graduate program in Polymer Science at the Institute of Materials Science in the University of Connecticut in 1982. In 1985, he was inducted into Sigma Xi, the scientific research honor society and Phi Kappa Phi, the oldest all-discipline honor society. He completed his Ph.D. in 1987 under the guidance of Edward T. Samulski and Montgomery T. Shaw. He went on to work at the University of Massachusetts between 1987 and 1989 as a postdoctoral research Fellow in the Department of Polymer Science and Engineering under the tutelage of Richard S. Stein and H. Henning Winter. Immediately afterwards, he was sought by the DuPont Company to work in the Pioneering Laboratory. He stayed with DuPont for 8 years in Wilmington, Delaware until 1997 as a Senior Staff Scientist in the Central Research and Development Department, after which he embarked upon an academic career at Stony Brook University. Joining Stony Brook University as an Assistant Professor in 1997, Hsiao was promoted to Full Professor in 2002 and appointed to the Chair of the Chemistry Department in 2007. It was under his leadership, that the Chemistry Department at Stony Brook was identified as one of the top departments in the nation, and designated a National Historic Landmark for the invention of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by the American Chemical Society. Hsiao was the Vice President for Research at Stony Brook University between 2012 and 2013 for 1.5 years. In this position, he was responsible for the campus-wide advancement of Stony Brook's research mission through strategic planning and oversaw the Research Foundation, supervised all University research administration activities and functions, and was the primary advocate for the University's research enterprise on a state, national and international level. His major contributions to the Stony Brook Research Office (SBRO) were in two areas: (1) greater efficiency and transparency of the research administration activities on campus, and (2) new research initiatives to advance Stony Brook's research mission on a state, national and international level. Since 2008, he has also served as the Chang-Jiang Professor at Donghua University in Shanghai, and a guest professor at the Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Tongji University and the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Research Hsiao's laboratory at Stony Brook University aims to understand the structural, morphological development and manipulation of complex polymer systems during preparation and processing in real time at both molecular and nanoscopic scales. His research in polymer science and engineering has led to novel water purification techniques, Together with his colleague Benjamin Chu, Hsiao has used combined electrospinning and cellulose nanofibrous membranes technologies to produce an hierarchical non-woven pattern of different size fibers (from micrometers to nanometers) to filter water. Along with its mechanical integrity and its interconnected pores and thus high pore density, these filters have high volumetric flow rates without compromised resistance to fouling. Since such filters can have several times better water flux, they are energy efficient and have a broad range of applications ranging from desalination to energy generation. Such nanofibrous formats are also useful for tissue engineering and drug delivery. As biodegradation rates and drug release rates in medical treatments are functions of fiber, porosity, morphology and chemical compositions, Hsiao and Chu have developed many useful new solutions for biomedical applications, such as nanofibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering and heart tissue constructs, and methods to prevent post- surgery induced abdominal adhesions. As a material scientist, Hsiao has focused on understanding the fundamental processes involved in the crystallization of polymers. In order to investigate polymer structures, morphology and dynamics from atomic (1-20 √Ö) to microscopic scales (20 - 1000 √Ö) in real time, Hsiao's laboratory has come up with simultaneous small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) techniques. By nature, SAXS probes relatively large-scale structures, in contrast to WAXD that deals mainly with the atomic structure of crystals. SAXS includes not only the diffraction of large lattice spacing, of the order of tens, hundreds or even thousands of interatomic distances, but also the scattering by perturbed or non-periodic structures of amorphous and semi-crystalline materials. Dedicated to polymer research, the Advanced Polymers Participating Research Team (AP-PRT) was formed in 1997 by Hsiao and his colleague Ben Chu to develop a synchrotron X-ray scattering beamline (X27C) at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Having published more than 403 peer-reviewed scientific papers, 41 reviews and chapters in books and encyclopedias, 226 conference proceedings, more than 32 issued patents (including 18 US patents) and 18 pending applications, and edited 2 books, Hsiao holds an h-index of 74 with an ISI Web of Knowledge total citation number exceeding 17,000. He has given more than 244 invited lectures in universities, governmental and industrial research institutes and more than 474 presentations in national and international scientific meetings.

Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a method of imaging using near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) or fluorescence-based methods. When used to create 3D volumetric models of the imaged material DOI is referred to as diffuse optical tomography, whereas 2D imaging methods are classified as diffuse optical topography. The technique has many applications to neuroscience, sports medicine, wound monitoring, and cancer detection. Typically DOI techniques monitor changes in concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and may additionally measure redox states of cytochromes. The technique may also be referred to as diffuse optical tomography (DOT), near infrared optical tomography (NIROT) or fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT), depending on the usage. In neuroscience, functional measurements made using NIR wavelengths, DOI techniques may classify as functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS.  Physical mechanism  Biological tissues can be considered strongly diffusive media, since during light propagation the scattering phenomenon is dominant over absorption in the so-called \\"therapeutic window\\" spectral range. Photon migration in diffusive media is described by the heuristic model of the diffusion equation, which offers analytical solutions for some specific geometries. Starting from the measured absorption and scattering coefficients, it is possible to derive the concentrations of tissues' main chromophores. Diffuse optical imaging can be implemented in time domain, frequency domain or continuous wave, in reflectance or transmittance configuration.

The studies show his mastery of painting, his own unique style and great imagination. Trƒôbacz was noted within the European art-world as a master portrait and landscape painter, but above all he was also a rare chronicler of the contemporary Jewish life, depicting a world that is now lost. His popular subjects included praying Rabbis, old men, street and Jewish domestic scenes, and genre painting depicting the everyday side of life. His psychological portraits of Jews earned him the greatest popularity and critical acclaim, and influenced the work of other Jewish painters in Poland. Notably, Trƒôbacz's oil painting \\"The Good Samaritan\\", reportedly stolen in 1904 at the World's Fair, was recently sold at auction at Sotheby's. Life Born in 1861 in Warsaw, the son of David Trƒôbacz, a house painter, Maurycy (Moj≈ºesz) at the age of 16 years was admitted to the school of drawing by professor Wojciech Gerson and Aleksander Kami≈Ñski. Three years later, with the support of Leopold Horowitz, he received a scholarship sponsored by lawyer Stanis≈Çaw Rotwand, and moved to Krak√≥w where he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts in the studios of Jan Matejko, Leopold Loeffler and W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åuszczkiewicz. Reclining male nude, 1887. National Museum, Warsaw From 1882, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich with Sandor Wagner (until 1884) and received the grand silver medal there at the completion of his studies for the work \\"Martyrdom\\". Between 1889 and 1890, he studied in Paris at the Acad√©mie Colarossi. He lived and worked in Munich for 4 years before returning to Warsaw. Over time, Trƒôbacz worked in Lviv and Drohobych, and eventually moved permanently to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where he founded and ran a private art school until September 1939. He is often criticized for giving in to popular demand later on in his career. Pressured by financial sponsors, he began to produce sentimental theme portraits pertaining to the bucolic life of country folk. Trƒôbacz made his successful artistic d√©but twice, first at the Munich Kunstverein, and then at the Krywult Salon in Warsaw as a 23-year- old painter. His another big success was the participation of painting \\"Good Samaritan\\" (1886, pictured) in a Kunstverein exhibition in Munich as well as at the I National Art Exhibition in Krak√≥w and in Warsaw at the Zachƒôta Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts. The painting was also awarded a gold medal at the Universal World Exposition in Chicago. Subsequently, Trƒôbacz also received a bronze medal at the Paris Universal World Exposition of 1889. \\"Good Samaritan\\" (1886), book engraving from painting by Maurycy Trƒôbacz, Warsaw Maurycy Trƒôbacz died of hunger in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto during the Holocaust in occupied Poland, and is buried at the Bracka Street Cemetery in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, grave #490. His wife Pola (Perla) also died in the ghetto in 1941, at the age of 54. They had three children, Edward, Zofia and Bronis≈Çaw. Until the occupation of Lodz by the Werharmacht and establishment of the Ghetto, he lived with his family in Wolczanska 140. In the ghetto he lived in Limanowskiego 19 street. Soon after the war ended, some 70 paintings of Maurycy Trƒôbacz (along with works of Izrael Lejzorowicz, Amos Szwarc, Mendel Grosman and others, wrote Dr. Cie≈õli≈Ñska-Lobkowicz) were located in Poland by Nachman Zonabend on behalf of the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction (JCR) and the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO) from the United States. Most were taken out of the country by Zonabend in 1947 against the official policy on protecting the national heritage, and then split between the YIVO Institute of New York and Yad Vashem. The illegal removal of the collection was criticized by Jewish press not only in the communist Poland, but also in Canada and France.

It has a bell-mouth shape and its salient feature is a flat plate deflector near the mouth. The term hydraucone was introduced by William M. White, who obtained a U.S. patent for it in 1917. Apparatus for utilizing the hydraucone action of water DISCHARGE-CHAMBER For WATER-WHEELS Return-Regainer Diffuser for Hydraulic Machines Background White observed that the simplest method of changing the direction of a jet of water was to direct it at a flat plate. The shape of the water jet as it hits the plate was the inspiration for the hydraucone profile. The main purpose of a draft tube is to recover the residual kinetic energy of the water that exits over the turbine. It does this by distributing the water that exits from the turbine uniformly over the larger area of the draft tube exit. This reduces the water velocity and water pressure at the turbine exit. The kinetic energy of the water, which is proportional to the square of the water velocity, is thus transformed into effectively a higher head across the turbine. The hydraucone draft tube is very efficient at recovering energy from the rotational motion of the water (swirl) as well as the linear motion (flow) of the water. It has fallen into disuse due to the difficulty of supporting a very wide opening under a large turbine. It only requires a shallow excavation, however, which is an advantage in rocky terrain. Its compact shape makes it suitable for small hydro projects where the excavation is much less than that required for the more conventional elbow shaped draft tube. An elbow-shaped draft tube is less efficient than a bell-mouth tube due to the fluid losses in the turn of the elbow. The difference in efficiency is more pronounced when there is swirl present as the gyroscopic effect of the rotation hinders the deflection at the elbow. Historical note In the 1920s William M. White and Lewis Ferry Moody both patented bell-mouth draft tubes. Hydraulic Apparatus Hydraulic Turbine The salient feature of Moody's Spreading Draft Tube is the center cone, which distinguishes it from White's Hydraucone Draft Tube. The term Hydraucone is sometimes erroneously used as a general term for all bell mouth tubes. The pair debated over which device was more efficient, particularly in the presence of swirl as water leaves the turbine. This debate was superseded by the widespread introduction of the elbow-shaped draft tube which is less efficient but easier to construct, particularly on a large scale. Dimensions and geometry Shapes for a bell-mouth draft tube include: *Radius of tube: r, Height of tube: z *Hyperbola: :r z = C, C \\\\rightarrow \\\\mbox{constant}, (radial water velocity is constant) *Logarithmic hyperbola: z = C \\\\mathrm{ln}( r ) , (radial water velocity is inversely proportional to the radius) *Straight line geometry (cone):z = C r, (radial water velocity is inversely proportional to the square of the radius) Theoretical and experimental validation Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) could resolve the question of which design is better. A rigorous CFD comparison of the two forms of bell-mouth draft tube would be a useful addition to knowledge of fluid dynamics.

The film stars Sachin Khedekar, Priya Bapat, Medha Manjrekar, Savita Malpekar and Ketaki Mategaonkar. Based on a short story by Usha Datar by the same name, the film depicts the tumultuous events in a Chitpavan Brahmin family, set around 1930‚Äì1950 in Konkan. The film was a commercial success and got critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay by Girish Joshi and also for the performances by its actors, especially Khedekar for his portrayal of Hari Damle as a head of the family. In 1989, the short story was adapted into a Marathi play Janmagaath with actor-director Vinay Apte playing the lead. Apte had desires to make a film based on it. However, his attempts were not successful. Sachin Khedekar, who went to play the lead in the cinematic adaptation of the story, had seen the play and came across the story again in 2007. Khedekar requested Girish Joshi to complete the adapted screenplay and together approached Manjrekar in 2009 to make a film on the story. Kaksparsh shooting was completed in 26 days - from 5 to 30 December 2011 and was released on 4 May 2012, on the occasion of centenary of Indian Cinema. The film won several awards on release including Best Film award at Maharashtra State Film Awards, MICTA, and 11th Pune International Film Festival. It is also the first Marathi film to have a home media release in Blu-ray. With the success of Kaksparsh, a Hindi and Tamil remake of Kaksparsh is also being directed by Mahesh Manjrekar with Arvind Swamy and Tisca Chopra as the leads.  Plot  Hari Damle (Sachin Khedekar), head of a Chitpavan Bramhin family, lives in the village Torgaon in Konkan with his wife Tara (Medha Manjrekar), their three children, his younger brother Mahadev (Abhijit Kelkar), and his widowed aunt, Namu Aatya (Savita Malpekar). Hari arranges the marriage of Mahadev with a pre-pubescent girl, Durga (Ketaki Mategaonkar), renamed as Uma after marriage. However, Mahadev dies before the consummation of the marriage. Hari performs death rituals (≈örƒÅddha) for Mahadev but crows (symbolic of the spirit of the deceased in Hinduism) refuse to touch the offerings. Hari mumbles something while offering food after which crow touches the offerings. The Brahmin community in the village now expects widow Uma to have her head shaved (a ritual). Hari opposes and does not allow any rituals to be performed for her as a widow. Hari stands behind Uma in all her difficulties which raise doubts about his intentions, including that by his wife, Tara. Years later, when Tara is diagnosed of a terminal disease, the now grown-up Uma (now played by Priya Bapat) takes charge of the household. Before Tara dies, she realises her mistakes and requests Hari to marry Uma which he readily refuses. In the meantime, Hari gets his son Sankarshan (Saksham Kulkarni) married. Once Hari finds Uma sitting outside the room of the newly married couple, listening to their playful banter. Disgusted by Uma's behaviour, Hari starts avoiding her. Upset by this behaviour, Uma tries to talk her heart out to Hari's friend Balwant (Sanjay Khapre) and requests him to find out the reason. Coincidentally, Hari overhears this and severs his relations with Balwant. Unaware of the reason for Hari's changed behaviour, Uma starts staying aloof, while her health starts degrading. Worried Sankarshan requests his sister Shanti (Manava Naik) to talk to Uma. Frustrated and unknowing of what loss she had throughout her life, Uma opens her heart but situation raises more questions about her relation with Hari. Uma decides to go on a fast and relents to none of the family member's request to quit. Hari, left with no other option, explains his behaviour. Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not let any other man touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he stopped talking to her, in spite of his love towards Uma. He eventually accepts that he loves Uma and would marry her, breaking his vow. Knowing the truth, Uma forgives Hari and agrees to the proposal. Hari fetches Mangala sutra but finds out that Uma is dead. He realises that Uma has sacrificed her life for his love where she did not want Hari to break his vow.

Actor- director Vinay Apte had done the role of Hari Damle in the play and Sukanya Kulkarni as Uma. Apte had tried making a film based on the story but was not successful. Sachin Khedekar had seen the play and came across the story again in 2007. He showed the story to Girish Joshi (screenplay writer of the film) who then developed a complete adapted screenplay from the story which had a length of 4‚Äì5 pages. Later, Khedekar and Joshi approached Mahesh Manjrekar in 2009 to make a film on the story. However, Majrekar was busy with his other projects and could not plan the film. Manjrekar said that when he heard the story for the first time, he considered it to be better than other Indian love stories like Bajirao-Mastani or Salim-Anarkali. Manjrekar had to wait as he did not have the copyrights for the story. He said that it \\"took more than three years to make this film\\". = Casting = After Manjrekar finished his projects, he decided to start Kaksparsh and signed Khedekar to portray the lead role of Hari Damle. The director said that there was no compulsion for him to cast Khedekar. He did it \\"because he was the best to pull it off.\\" Earlier Manjrekar had signed another actress to play the role of Tara Damle, however the actress declined to join the schedule at the last moment, thus Manjrekar was forced to look out for the alternative. His wife, Medha Manjrekar, had done a small role in his debut film Aai (1995) and also made a comeback in another film De Dhakka (2008) written by him. As Medha was working as a producer for Kaksparsh, Mahesh Manjrekar approached her to play the role. Manjrekar had worked with Priya Bapat in Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy (2009) and had mentioned about Kaksparsh to her. He desired Bapat to play the lead role of Uma, however the film couldn't start as planned. When Manjrekar planned for the film, he called Bapat again who had married Umesh Kamat in the meantime. Manjrekar had seen 2011 National Award-winning film Shala and was impressed with a teen-aged character played by Ketaki Mategaonkar and decided to cast her as a young Uma. Savita Malpekar was cast to play the role of Khedekar's widowed aunt. Malpekar had to shave her head to prepare for the role. Manjrekar insisted that the film cast including Savita Malpekar should shave the head for their roles and avoid wearing a prosthetic bald patch. = Filming = Krishna Ghat, Wai, Maharashtra where all the temple scenes of the films have been shot. Kaksparsh was shot in the real locations than sets and was mainly shot in Paalshet, a village near Guhagar in Konkan. As the film's story-line was set around 1930‚Äì1950, Manjrekar was concerned about the authentic production design for the film. He appointed two production designers, Prashant Rane and Abhishek Vijaykar, who had challenges of depicting pre and post Indian independence era. Rane had worked with Manjrekar earlier for De Dhakka (2008). Kaksparsh shooting was completed in 26 days; starting from 5 December 2011 till 30 December 2011. The initial shooting scheduled started at Ranade Wada in Pune. The film also had a few scenes in and surrounding the temple but as most of the temples in Konkan region have been restored from their damages over the period of time, Manjrekar feared that the plastering done to repair the damages would not give the desired authentic feel to the film. Thus, the next schedule was shifted to Krishna Ghat, Wai, Maharashtra. As a director, Manjrekar believed that the mansion shown in the film \\"plays a major character\\" and was certain that finding the appropriate mansion would be a difficult job. The production designing team had searched for various location across Konkan but most of the mansions had electrical wiring across which was a major obstacle for the shooting as Konkan then did not have electricity. Finally, Manjrekar was introduced to a mansion owned by Avinash Nene near Paalshet which suited the period where third and final schedule of the film was carried out.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack for the film is composed by Rahul Ranade and music director duo Ajit Parab and Sameer Mhatre, popularly known as Ajit-Sameer. Poet-Actor Kishor Kadam (\\"Saumitra\\") and Mitali Joshi have written the lyrics for the songs. Being a period film set in 1930, soundtrack mainly consists of traditional songs in the form of Ovee, a type of meterical stanza in Marathi poetry by Mrs.Kumudini Pawar. Rahul Ranade used Vibhavari Joshi's voice for all of his compositions except \\"Janma Baicha\\". Joshi rendered all her songs without any musical accompaniment. As most of the songs are in the form of Ovee, Ranade decided to use the traditional musical format. He took help of Mrs. Kumudini Pawar,sister of great folk literate Dr.Sarojini Babar a Marathi writer-politician who had studied the songs of the period depicted in the film. Mrs. Kumudini Pawar introduced Ranade to Babar's, collection of various traditional Ovee. For two situation songs, Ranade requested Kishor Kadam to write the lyrics. The duo Ajit-Sameer composed two theme tracks and one song (\\"Kuthe Paath Phiravun\\") for the film's soundtrack. A noted Hindustani classical vocalist, Rajashree Pathak, rendered the song and was appreciated for \\"its vocal and soulfulness\\" and won Best Playback Singer (Female) at 2012 Zee Gaurav Puraskar. The soundtrack also made use of \\"Are Sansar Sansar\\", much-quoted couplet from one of the poems written by noted Marathi poet Bahinabai Chaudhari. The song is narrated and rendered by film's lead actors, Sachin Khedekar and Ketaki Mategaonkar respectively and is arranged by Sameer Mhatre. Before taking up acting, Mategaonkar had participated in singing reality show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Marathi L'il Champs. The soundtrack was released after the film's release and was acclaimed for \\"bringing an authentic and subtle flavour to the period of the film.\\" Kishore Kadam was also appreciated for writing lyrics which suitably noted the traditions followed by women during the period.  Reception  Kaksparsh was released on 4 May 2012 which also marked a beginning of the 100th year of Indian cinema. The film received wide critical acclaim and was a commercial success. It got critical acclaim for the direction by Mahesh Manjrekar, its screenplay by Girish Joshi and for the performances by its actors, especially Sachin Khedekar for his portrayal of Hari Dada Damle as the head of the family. Ajit Reddy's cinematography and Ajit-Sameer's music were also praised. The film was said to have brought the \\"best out of\\" the director. Manjrekar said that he \\"expected to it be a hit, but not expected such a landslide hit\\". The film was noted to have a \\"strong script\\" and well presented \\"a sensitive issue.\\" It was called as \\"the best love story in Marathi films.\\" It was marketed as a love story, and a review in Maharashtra Times by Saumitra Pote noted that \\"the film has gone beyond a love story\\". The film also said to have shown \\"the mores of the period quite accurately\\". Aniruddha Bhatkhande of weekly Marathi magazine Lokprabha criticised the film in his review by saying that the actual film is a way different than the \\"attractive\\" promos. He further said that the film's costume designs are flawed and as most of the film is shot indoor, it gives a feeling to the viewers that they are watching a recorded theatre play. ;Remake With the success of Kaksparsh, it was reported in June 2012 that Manjrekar is planning a remake in Hindi starring Amitabh Bachchan. However, the director readily clarified that he is not planning for a remake and he did contact Bachchan for the film but not for the remake. Later in January 2014, Manjrekar announced that a Hindi and Tamil remake of Kaksparsh is being directed by himself starring Arvind Swamy, Tisca Chopra, Adinath Kothare and Ketaki Mategaonkar. Swamy will be portraying Khedekar's role whereas Chopra will be seen as Swamy's wife, originally played by Medha Manjrekar. Mategaonkar will reprise her role from the original and Vaidehi Parshurami will be playing the older Uma. Milind Soman is reported to play Swamy's friend and Adinath Kothare will play Mahadev's character which was originally played by Abhijit Kelkar. Murali Sharma will be seen portraying a negative character. The veteran Bollywood actress Tanuja will be portraying the role of widowed aunt, played by Savita Malpekar in the original. The music will be composed by Ilaiyaraaja with Mategoankar and Vibhavari Apte Joshi rendering their first Tamil song. Adinath Kothare's wife Urmila Kanitkar will be doing a guest appearance.

Her father was a compositor, and she was educated at Enfield County School, a girls' grammar school. She then worked for the Civil Service. During the Second World War she was assigned to the Post Office. While working there she met her future husband William Ashton Tait. They married in 1943 and had a son, John, by the end of the war. After the war she worked variously as a teacher, at the Patent Office, and as an administrator at London University. Motivation for Activism Her husband Bill continued to work for the Post Office after the war. In 1968 he died of pleural mesothelioma.http://www.britishasbestosnewsletter.org/ban74.htm#n1 The link between asbestos and mesothelioma had only been recently established at the time, and Bill had not worked directly with the compound, though he had been exposed to it. The Post Office did not accept that he had acquired an industrial disease as a result of his work, and refused to accept liability for the condition that led to his death. Following her husband's death, Nancy began a campaign to seek recognition that he died of an industrial disease. Over the following forty years this campaign broadened to cover other diseases and conditions caused by working conditions. She became an expert in asbestos- related diseases, and lobbied continuously for better treatment for sufferers and legal acknowledgement of liabilities incurred by employers who had exposed their staff to asbestos. She represented the families of asbestos victims at inquests and in appeals against the DHSS's refusal to meet claims for industrial disablement benefit. Writings and collaborations Nancy Tait taught herself about asbestos, then began to write her own asbestos literature. In 1976 she published the booklet \\"Asbestos Kills\\". This generated additional interest in her campaign, as did the award of a Churchill fellowship, which allowed her to visit a wide range of experts to collect information in support of her work. Through her diligent research skills, she became a published co-author of scientific papers on the topic of asbestos and health.; Angered by the asbestos industry's response to the rising scrutiny of the magic mineral‚Äôs safety record, Nancy Tait established an asbestos action group in 1978, the Society for the Prevention of Asbestosis and Industrial Diseases (SPAID), the first of a string of asbestos action groups and asbestos victims support groups worldwide. SPAID lobbied for tighter asbestos controls, for fairer compensation, for better death reporting and asbestos death statistics, and supported those affected by asbestos in their endeavours to claim industrial injuries benefits and/or compensation from past employers. From 1988, SPAID ran its own electron microscope laboratory, with whose aid Tait advised special medical boards on respiratory diseases and coroners on the assessment of the presence of asbestos fibres in lung tissue. The instrument was, she stated in 1999, the only bulwark against [certain medical experts‚Äô] efforts to secure verdicts of natural causes or open verdicts. From 1996 SPAID operated under the name Occupational and Environmental Diseases Association (OEDA). Tait also collaborated with artist Conrad Atkinson on statement artworks speaking out against asbestos disease. In addition to the Churchill fellowship, Tait was awarded an MBE in 1996 and an honorary doctorate from Southampton University in 1999. In 2005 the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health awarded her the Sypol Lifetime Achievement Award. She died on 13 February 2009; she was survived by a son, a sister and a brother. The extensive OEDA archive is deposited with the University of Strathclyde.

The Court held that Canadian police located in the United States were still subject to the Charter when interrogating a suspect for a murder in Canada. Background Deltonia Cook was arrested by US police in Louisiana at the request of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Initially upon arrest he was read his Miranda rights by the US police officers. He requested access to a lawyer but the police never followed through with the request. When the Canadian police arrived they questioned him but it was not until 20 minutes into the interrogation that they informed him of his right to retain and instruct counsel under section 10(b) of the Charter. At trial the Crown sought to admit as evidence parts of the statements Cook made in the interrogation. Cook challenged the evidence as a violation of his rights under section 10(b). Reasons of the Court The court held that acts of any Canadian police force performing duties outside of Canada are subject to the Charter. In this particular case, the court found that there was a violation of the accused‚Äôs right to counsel and right to silence. These violations were flagrant and the evidence would not have been otherwise been discovered thus rendering the trial unfair. Consequently, the evidence of Mr. Cook‚Äôs statement was excluded. Justices L'Heureux-Dub√© and McLachlin dissented, stating that the Charter did not apply, and that the police were working as part of an American investigation and were acting under their authority.

Boshell's Mill, one of several mills run by the Boshell family in Walker County, was started by William R. Boshell in 1885. It was initially a steam engine-powered sawmill only, with the creek used to transport logs to the mill. Boshell expanded the mill in 1901 with the addition of a dam built using locally quarried stone. It was completed in 1902. A gristmill was built on the opposite bank of the creek in 1903. Water turbines at each end of the dam supplied power to each mill. The Boshell family operated the mills until 1963. It was listed on the National Register on May 30, 1975.

Through its Division KEMA Labs, CESI is the world leader for the independent Testing, Inspection and Certification activities in the electricity industry. With a legacy of more than 60 years of experience, CESI operates in 70 countries around the world and supports its global clients in meeting the energy transition challenges. The company‚Äôs key global clients include major utilities, Transmission System Operators (TSOs), Distribution System Operators (DSOs), power generation companies (GenCos), system integrators, financial investors and global electromechanical and electronic manufacturers, as well as governments and regulatory authorities. In addition, CESI works in close cooperation with international financial institutions such as, among others, the World Bank Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank. Major consulting services include: Power Systems studies and Power Market studies, Master Planning and Operational Planning, design and Owner‚Äôs Engineering for HVAC/HVDC Interconnections, Real Time Operations supervision and control, Asset Management, Integration of Renewable Energies and Storage Systems, design and Owner‚Äôs Engineering of Smart Grids and Smart Metering deployments, Technological and Environmental Audits, Control and Regulation Systems for Power Plants, Engineering services for Testing Laboratories, Environmental Impact Assessments, Civil Engineering Services for hydro and renewable plants and Environmental Monitoring Systems for Electric Power Plants. CESI also develops and manufactures advanced solar cells, III-V triple junction GaAS for space and terrestrial application (CPV). CESI is a fully independent joint-stock company headquartered in Milan and with facilities in Arnhem, Berlin, Mannheim, Prague, Dubai, Knoxville (USA), Chalfont (USA), Rio de Janeiro and Santiago de Chile. History CESI was founded in 1956, and has more than 60 years of experience in testing and consulting services for the electrical industry. The strong necessity of doing experimental tests and network studies persuaded the big electromechanical industries (Pirelli, SAE, Ercole Marelli, Ansaldo), together with the majority of electrical industries (Edison, SADE, Montecatini, Falck), of the need of a ‚ÄúGreat Power laboratory‚Äù. In the early 50s, the ‚ÄúX Laboratory‚Äù was born. At the end of the 50s, CESI is developed a leadership in the determination of short-circuit powers inside the transmission lines and in load flows‚Äô problems. In the 1958, its international aim is attested thanks to an important commission: the study of the system El Choc√≥n Dam ‚Äì Buenos Aires for the construction of two hydroelectric plants. The problems of the unification of electrical frequencies and of the interconnection networks, enabling energy interchange between an ‚Äúisland‚Äù and another and consequently achieve Italian electrical system unity, lead to the establishment in 1962 of ENEL. In the 1964, ENEL decided to use CESI‚Äôs laboratories to make targeted studies for its operative activity. The company purchased the majority of the capital of CESI. CESI, under the boost of the increase in electricity consumption, built new laboratories, also for high voltage cable tests. This gave birth to the ‚Äú1000 kV‚Äôs Project‚Äù, which was realized for the transport of energy and high voltage on the Italian electrical networks. The ‚Äú1000 kV‚Äôs Project‚Äù was a key step in the history of electrical industry‚Äôs research, not only in Italy but also in the world. In 1988, CESI signed a convention with IMQ which bring to fruition the CSQ (Certified Quality Systems). At December 1989, ENEL charged CESI with a research project to be finished in three years: the Energy storage for a stationary and vehicular use. The topic was the application of the electrical battery not only on traditional power plants but especially on non traditional ones, like photovoltaic and wind power. The project faced off the development and industrialization of pioneering batteries and, at the same time, wanted to realized prototypes of electric vehicles with a highest degree of innovation. FGH facility in Mannheim In 2002, CESI acquired the Piacenza‚Äôs laboratory from ENEL Produzione, which has integrated and extended the offer of monitoring systems for thermoelectric plants during the operation and maintenance. In addition, the company got the hydraulic and structural pole from ENEL; ENEL Hydro S.p.A. which delivers services for hydroelectric power plants. ISMES was purchased in 2004 and, thanks to the deal, CESI increased its competences in land conservation, natural hazards and qualification of civil structures and industrial plants, preservation of monuments and monitoring services. 2005 saw CESI's expertise in laboratory testing being extended through the acquisition of IPH GmbH (located in Berlin) and FGH Engineering & Test GmbH (located in Mannheim) from Vattenfall Europe. Both companies are working in the field of testing of high -, medium - and low voltage electrical components. CESI Ricerca created in 2005 with ENEA, and it has been transferred into GSE (Electrical Services Manager) in 2009. With a view to cater closely to international client needs, CESI established two new companies: CESI Middle East was set up in 2011 in Dubai and CESI do Brasil in March 2012. On February 2012, CESI Middle East has been contracted by the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development to come up with a plan for integrating the loosely connected electricity and natural gas networks of 20 Arab countries. CESI is a founding member of RES4MED, an association that aims to increase renewable energy sources penetration and to analyse the conditions for integrated electricity markets in the Mediterranean area.

History The lujon was invented by William Loughborough. At his Sausalito, California studio, Loughborough created a variety of new percussion instruments, including the boobam and lujon, after working with Harry Partch in the mid-1950s. The lujon is played with soft mallets and produces a sound that is dominated by its fundamental frequency. The instrument is also known as a loo-jon or metal log drum. In a 2009 Web post, Loughborough provided the following historical background: \\"Henry Mancini's drummer, Shelly Manne had several drums I made and one of them was the Lujon (a pun on 'John Lewis' who bought the first one). Mancini was very impressed with the instrument and wrote ['Lujon'] using its scale as the theme.\\" On 7 April 2010, Loughborough died of a heart attack in Madrid, Spain, at the age of 84. Composers Composers who have written for lujon include Jerry Goldsmith, Gerald Fried, Dave Grusin, Clare Fischer, Colin Matthews and John Williams.

Unlike traditional structures such as bulkheads or seawalls that worsen erosion, living shorelines incorporate as many natural elements as possible which create more effective buffers in absorbing wave energy and protecting against shoreline erosion. The process of creating a living shoreline is referred to as soft engineering, which utilizes techniques that incorporate ecological principles in shoreline stabilization. The natural materials used in the construction of living shorelines create and maintain valuable habitats. Structural and organic materials commonly used in the construction of living shorelines include sand, wetland plants, sand fill, oyster reefs, submerged aquatic vegetation, stones and coir fiber logs. Benefits and ecosystem services * Shoreline stabilization * Riparian and intertidal protection * Water quality improvements from upland run-off filtration * Terrestrial and aquatic habitat creation * Absorption of wave energy, leading to reduced erosion rates * Preservation of natural shoreline exchanges * Enhancement of fisheries feeding and breeding habitat * Adaptability and use in a wide range of environments * Potential for less associated costs compared to traditional structures such as seawalls and bulkheads * Creates and preserves nursery and critical feeding habitats for aquatic life * Allows for a more natural aesthetic display than traditional structures Design A completed living shoreline project at Glenn Martin National Wildlife Refuge, Smith Island, Maryland Many factors need to be addressed when preparing a living shoreline project. Permitting requirements and appropriate restoration strategies for a particular habitat are two critical topics for consideration before construction begins. =Planning and implementation steps= 1\\\\. Analysis of the site: The bank erosion rate, elevation level, vegetation, wave energy, wind patterns, wave activity and soil type of the proposed site need to be examined to determine if it is an appropriate area for living shoreline stabilization. Restoration plans of stabilization activities are designed upon completion of the initial site analysis. 2\\\\. Permitting: Before any implementation begins, permits should be applied for and obtained through the appropriate regulatory agencies. All project plans need to be in compliance with local, state and federal laws before any construction begins to avoid legal issues and ensure long-term sustainability. 3\\\\. Site preparation: Once the necessary permits are obtained, preparation begins by clearing all debris, unstable trees and existing failing structures, such as bulkheads, from the site. In addition, any issues regarding stormwater runoff must also be addressed prior to the installation of a living shoreline. 4\\\\. Project installation: Generally, living shoreline structures will include planting marsh, riparian, or other types of aquatic vegetation. Bio-logs, organic fiber mats and oyster shells are also readily used materials throughout installation. 5\\\\. Maintenance and monitoring: The restored habitat area should be regularly monitored upon completion to obtain data on project successes. The collection of such data will improve construction and implementation strategies of future projects. The site should also be maintained by replanting necessary vegetation, removing debris and adding sand fill when appropriate. The materials should also be monitored to ensure they are staying in place and achieving desired shoreline stabilization goals. =Materials= Planting trees and shrubs for a Potomac River stabilization project in Maryland Vegetation zone * Clean dredge material and sand fill are generally used to construct a rolling slope to weaken wave energy and provide an area to plant vegetation. Regrading, filling and replanting native vegetation can occur on sites that do not have a bulkhead or on sites where bulkheads have been removed. If removing the bulkhead is not feasible, another option is to fill sand in front of the structure and regrade and replant vegetation on the shoreline and embankment. * Roots from trees and grass stabilize the riparian area above high tide by gripping the soil. Such activity results in bank erosion minimization, wildlife habitat creation and upland runoff filtration. The type of plants that make up common riparian zones typically include grasses, shrubs and woody trees but the species of each are dependent on the naturally occurring vegetation of the area. Wetland and beach areas Geotextile tubes filled with sand * Breakwaters provide erosion control and facilitate habitat development by breaking up wave activity in open-water areas. These structures, made with rock and oyster spat, should be placed in areas of medium to high wave energy and arranged parallel to the bank. Once implemented, the area around the shoreline should be calmer than before which can allow for the creation of marsh and intertidal habitat through the replanting of marsh grasses and other submerged aquatic plants. * Filter fabric is a key element in minimizing soil loss under rocks. This porous material made from natural elements is commonly implemented under breakwaters and rock sills or other hybrid living shoreline locations. * Geotextile material tubes measure about 12 feet in diameter, are filled with sediment and aligned with the shoreline to weaken wave energy and protect against erosion. These tubes facilitate oyster reef development and create areas to dispose of new dredge material. * Low-crested rock sills are formed by the parallel arrangement and underwater placement of single rocks along shorelines and marshes. The rocks decrease erosion rates in these areas by dispelling oncoming wave energy. The placement of these sills are no greater than 6 to 12 inches over the mean high water mark and typically divided into sections to allow for the passing of boats, large waves and wildlife. * Mangroves play a critical role in shoreline stabilization through the trapping of nutrients and sediments and dissipation of wave energy administered by their extensive root system. The incorporation of mangroves with living shorelines could play a large role in decreasing erosion rates since they naturally occur in subtropical and estuarine tropical areas. More specifically, mangroves are typically found in southern Florida, the Caribbean and some areas of southern Louisiana. * Marsh grasses are generally planted up to the mean high tide line and in the water of the intertidal zones to break up wave energy, provide fish and wildlife habitat and improve water quality through upland runoff filtration. Studies show that plantings may show more success when administered in the spring in areas with existing marsh, mild wind conditions and surrounding areas of less than 3 miles of open water. Coir fiber log installation * Natural bio-logs/fiber logs can be used to reduce bank erosion and stabilize inclines by implementation at the bottom of a slope or in the water which is formed to the bank line and secured in place. The coconut fiber and netting are biodegradable and work to grab sediment, hold moisture to facilitate vegetative growth, and allow stability of the bank while roots develop. * Natural fiber matting can be made from a combination of biodegradable, organic mediums but is primarily made from jute, straw, coir fiber or wood. Placing such matting over an abrupt eroding slope minimizes sediment loss and catches sediments otherwise transported by wave dynamics. Natural fiber matting can also be implemented with riparian vegetation or marsh grass plantings to improve bank stabilization. * Rock footers are small quantities of boulder or rock intended to enhance bank stabilization and add additional support to bio-logs. Rock footers can also be used to support the structure of the biodegradable fiber logs, so that they do not fall out into steeper areas of the bank. * Rubble and recycled concrete can be used to form a breakwater offshore of a living shoreline site to refract wave energy before it hits the area. The addition of oyster spat these breakwaters can simultaneously enhance water quality and facilitate habitat growth. Submerged aquatic zone * Oyster shell reefs are another option when creating living shorelines. Oysters are critical in enhancing water quality and providing habitat to fish species, so creation of oyster reefs to decrease shoreline erosion rates have many added benefits. In addition, the establishment of oyster reefs play a role in protecting valuable aquatic vegetation of the marine ecosystem. To ensure a healthy reef, only clean oyster shells that have been sitting in the sun for adequate time should be used in the construction process. * Reef balls of oysters can achieve similar outcomes as oyster shell reefs but have a different implementation process. This type of artificial reef is made up of small, hallow concrete balls that facilitates the build-up of oyster shells as oyster spat take hold on the outside of the structure. An advantage of this implementation strategy is that it decreases poaching of oysters which can be a common obstacle in living shoreline construction that use oyster shells. * Seagrass beds create natural buffer zones against shoreline erosion when implemented in association with living shorelines. In addition, seagrass beds enhance water quality, improve sediment stabilization, supply habitat and food for aquatic organisms and dissipate high-energy waves.

Carter, a 21-year-old African-American man, was found dead from a gunshot while handcuffed in the back of a police patrol car. His death was ruled a suicide by the Arkansas State Crime Lab. Carter was in the passenger seat of a pickup truck which was stopped by the Jonesboro Police Department of Jonesboro, Arkansas. It was reported that an officer found small amounts of cannabis on his person after a body search and ran his information through the police computer network. The officers discovered that he had an outstanding warrant, so they placed him under arrest, searching him again and handcuffing his hands behind his back before placing him in the patrol vehicle. Minutes later, the officers discovered that Chavis Carter was shot in the head. The officers found a semi-automatic, .380-caliber Cobra pistol near the body. The Jonesboro Police Department believe that he had hidden the gun on his person that the officers did not detect through the two searches and used it on himself. Carter's mother disagreed, claiming that Carter had no history of suicidal thoughts or actions, and addressed the fact that he had made arrangements with his girlfriend to meet him at the prison the next day, and that the police killed him. In addition, she states that he was left-handed and was handcuffed behind his back, yet the bullet entered through his right temple. The two officers at the scene were placed on administrative leave and an investigation was started. A video was released by the police in which a police officer of similar height and build to Carter shows how Carter could have shot himself while handcuffed in a police car. A witness to the event said the police were outside the vehicle when the shot was fired. The FBI were requested by the Jonesboro Police Department to investigate the death. The local NAACP sponsored a vigil. There have been several protests in Jonesboro due to many not believing the police explanation of Carter's death. On August 20, 2012, the Arkansas crime lab ruled the death as a suicide. Similar deaths Jesus Huerta was killed in 2013 in Durham, North Carolina and Victor White III died in a Louisiana in 2014 under the same circumstances.

The main storyline played out over five episodes (\\"Reliable Information\\" [#212] - \\"Nemesis\\" [#216]), with the first scene to feature Beech appearing in \\"Smoking Demons\\" [#211], and the events following Beech's escape being revealed in \\"Taking Flak\\" [#217] and \\"Game Over\\" [#218]. Synopsis Manson gets a call from a prisoner at Hayesend prison, who wants to pass on information about a planned diamond robbery involving a stolen digger. When he arrives, he finds that the prisoner is none other than Don Beech, former Sun Hill detective sergeant and his former sergeant at Barton Street. Nixon and McAllister investigate when the stolen digger turns up at a transport site. Manson's suspicions are proven to be correct, but nobody else knows that Manson's tip-offs are coming from Beech. The arrival of Peter Cavanaugh, an Australian inspector on attachment to the NCIS, sets hearts a-flutter, but Meadows is furious when Manson's liaisons with Beech are revealed. CID and SO19 lie in wait for Trevor Little's team to pull off the diamond robbery, but when the raid is aborted at the last minute, Beech's information to Manson isn't looking so kosher. Meadows warns Manson away from Beech, but Manson goes to see him again when he is beaten up in prison. After failing to capture Trevor Little and his gang after their aborted diamond raid, Manson begins to have his doubts about Cavanaugh, and informs Hunter that he suspects that Cavanaugh may be leaking information to the gang. The rivalry between the two inspector escalates, but Cavanaugh has his eye set on Nixon, and the two share a passionate kiss. Manson's suspicions about Cavanaugh continue during an obbo on the diamond heist suspects. When the suspects get away from them, Cavanaugh doesn't seem particularly concerned. Concerned for the safety of Nixon and Tait, who are undercover as waiting staff on the target boat, Manson orders Hunter on to the boat as well, when he realises that Cavanaugh has organised a police launch to aid the suspects. When the suspects work out that police are on board, guns are drawn. Hunter manages to foil the raid, and all five suspects are arrested - and Cavanaugh begins to plan his escape. Realising that Cavanaugh is about to flee the country, Manson returns to Beech for evidence to prove Cavanaugh's involvement. Beech has the only evidence that could incriminate Cavanaugh, and Meadows is reluctant to have to rely on the slippery character, but Okaro insists he is their only choice. Cavanaugh contacts Nixon and declares his love for her, begging her to join him on the run. She agrees, but informs Meadows of his plans, thus going undercover, posing as though she has been suspended. Using her mobile as a tracking device, Meadows closes in, but when Cavanaugh realises he's been betrayed, he takes her hostage. Manson and Hunter keep their end of the deal by giving Beech a transfer to a Category C prison. They take Beech to visit Maggie Black, who has the incriminating tape, and Beech asks Manson if he can have ten minutes alone to \\"say goodbye\\" to Maggie. When Hunter goes to interrupt their little liaison, he finds himself held at gunpoint. When he awakens, he finds Manson tied up - and Beech gone. Nixon is haunted by the memory of her recent relationship with corrupt copper Cavanaugh, who gloatingly suggests that Manson deliberately let Beech escape from custody. With little evidence to prove his own innocence, Manson is forced to sit back and take the allegations being thrown at him as the DPS start a full-blown investigation. Manson is cleared of any involvement in Beech's escape, but Meadows warns him he's still on thin ice. Cast * Supt. Adam Okaro - Cyril Nri * Insp.

His father, businessman Jim Haslam, founded the Pilot Corporation in 1958 as the Pilot Oil Corporation. Personal life Haslam, who lives in his native Knoxville, Tennessee, is the elder brother of Bill Haslam, the former Governor of Tennessee. He is married to Susan \\"Dee\\" Bagwell Haslam, CEO of RIVR Media, part of the family ownership group of Pilot and co-owner of the Browns and Crew. They have three adult children, James Bagwell Haslam (adopted 2016), Whitney Haslam Johnson, and Cynthia Haslam Arnholt and five grandchildren. While attending the University of Tennessee, Haslam was a roommate of Bob Corker, who went on to become a United States Senator from Tennessee. He is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Pilot Flying J Haslam began his career at Pilot Corporation in 1976. In 1980, Haslam was named vice president of sales, development and operations. At that time, Pilot operated 100 convenience stores with annual fuel sales of about 125 million gallons. Pilot opened its first travel center in 1981, and by 1996 ‚Äì the same year Haslam was named president and chief executive officer ‚Äì the company operated 96 travel centers and 50 convenience stores and its total gallon sales had reached 1.2 billion. Pilot Corporation attained yet another milestone in 2001 when it joined with Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC to form Pilot Travel Centers LLC. In 2008, Pilot Corporation announced that CVC Capital Partners had acquired 49.8% interest in Pilot Travel Centers LLC, facilitating the sale by Marathon Petroleum Company (formerly Marathon Ashland Petroleum) of its interest in Pilot Travel Centers. Pilot Corporation retained 50% ownership of Pilot Travel Centers LLC. In 2015, the Haslam family acquired all of CVC Capital Partners‚Äô shares in the company. Pilot‚Äôs convenience store operations continue to be fully owned by Pilot Corporation. In 2010, Pilot Travel Centers LLC joined with Flying J Inc. In 2012, Pilot Flying J acquired Western Petroleum and the majority ownership of Maxum Petroleum and in 2012 formed Maxum Enterprises LLC, d/b/a Pilot Logistics Services. In 2014, Pilot Logistics Services merged with Thomas Petroleum to form Pilot Thomas Logistics.

Pilot Flying J is one of the largest top 10 privately held companies in the United States and employs more than 24,000 employees. The Pilot Flying J network provides customers with access to more than 70,000 parking spaces for trucks, 4,800 showers and 4,300 diesel lanes featuring DEF at the pump. In April 2013, the FBI executed a search warrant and affidavit detailing a five-year fraud scheme by the Pilot Flying J chain. The company paid restitution to customers and agreed to pay a $92 million penalty pursuant to a Criminal Enforcement Agreement.Ellen Myers, \\"Browns owner Jimmy Haslam's truck stop chain will pay $92 million fraud fine\\", The Christian Science Monitor, July 15, 2014.

He is the co-founder of the Haslam Scholars Program for premier honor students at the University of Tennessee. NFL team ownership Haslam bought a minority interest in the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2008. In 2012, he reached an agreement with Browns owner Randy Lerner to purchase the franchise for $1 billion. The Browns were valued at $977 million in 2011 by Forbes magazine, 20th in the NFL. NFL rules prohibit ownership in multiple teams and so Haslam sold his interest in the Steelers. The Haslams' purchase of the Browns was unanimously approved by the 32 teams in the NFL on October 12; the sale itself closed thirteen days later. Since officially taking over the Browns seven games into the 2012 season, Haslam has a 21-75-1 record as team owner. MLS team ownership In late 2018, reports emerged that Haslam had purchased Major League Soccer club Columbus Crew SC from Anthony Precourt, who wanted to move the club to Austin, Texas. Haslam, along with his wife Dee and former team physician Pete Edwards, took over as owners on January 1, 2019, as a deal to purchase the club from Precourt was finalized.

The main site is in Rovereto, and contains mostly modern and contemporary artworks, including works from renowned Giorgio Morandi, Giorgio de Chirico, Felice Casorati, Carlo Carr√† and Fortunato Depero. Fortunato Depero's house in Rovereto (known as Casa d'Arte Futurista Depero) is also part of the Museum. The permanent collection contains more than 15,000 artworks, including paintings, drawings, engravings, and sculptures. History The MART originated in 1987 as an autonomous entity within the autonomous Trentino province. It was installed in the Palazzo delle Albere in Trento. The idea of expanding the museum in order to combine both the legacy of the great futurist Fortunato Depero and the disparate inheritance held by the Trento Regional Arts Museum (\\"Museo Provinciale d'Arte di Trento\\") dates back to 1991, and was the project, in the first instance, of Gabriella Belli. On 15 December 2002 the MART finally opened to the general public, with a new headquarters at Rovereto, a small town a short distance to the south of Trento. Design and construction Design of the new building was entrusted to the Ticinese architect Mario Botta, who worked on its development with the Rovereto structural engineer Giulio Andreolli. A 29,000 square metre site was available, but between the site and the road (Via Bettini) allowance had to be made for two substantial eighteenth century town houses (palazzi). Fortunately there is a gap between the two which provides sufficient space for an entrance. Botta's solution to the challenges of the site draws inspiration from classical forms (notably that of the Pantheon), but also incorporates technically adventurous solutions. Invoking the mantra, \\"Space for art, not space despite art\\", the design involves a \\"pantheon without a facade\\", involving three storeys of museum space arranged around a large round \\"agora\\", covered over with \\"glass\\" dome/cupola with a 40-meter diameter. The structure of the cupola makes extensive use of steel and \\"plexiglass\\", and includes a \\"missing slice\\" made possible by complex engineering solutions. in the central area beneath the cupola there is a fountain. The wall facings make use of the yellow stone from Vicenza, which was the stone favoured by Andrea Palladio, although the innovative way in which the facing slabs have been attached allows for each to be individually replaced without major structural upheavals, in a way owes little to the sixteenth century architectural maestro. The \\"agora\\" can accommodate up to 1,200 visitors. Exhibitions Words and Stars (April 02 ‚Äî July 02, 2017) presented Nobel prize winning author Pamuk and renowned contemporary artist Toderi's collaborative project exploring \\"the inclination of man to explore space and innate vocation to question the stars,\\" which took \\"shape in a trilogy divided into a monologue, dialogue and conversation on the stars: three large installations immersive multi-screen consisting of eight video projections, which combine images and text. The vocation cosmological inherent to the project thus finds expression in a unique visual and literary body.\\" The show was curated by Gianfranco Maraniello.\\"Grazia Toderi & Orhan Pamuk: Words and Stars,\\" by My Art Guides, accessed April 06, 2017, http://myartguides.com/exhibitions/grazia-toderi-orhan-pamuk-words-and-stars/ Recent exhibitions include An Eternal Beauty.

History =Early history= The first known reference to Rudbjerggaard is from 1231 when it is mentioned as crown land in the Danish Census Book. The first more widely known owner of the estate was Mogens Ebbes√∏n, for many years the king's vassal first at Aalholm Castle and later Koldinghus. His family owned Rudbjerggaard for more than a century. Mogens Grubbe acquired Rudbjerggaard in 1555 but already the following year sold it to Erik Rud from the manors of Fuglsang and M√∏gelk√¶r. The first part of Rudbjerggaard, rud-, originally derives from the Danish for rye but is later associated with his family name. =Knud Rud's new house= Around the turn of the century, Erik Rud's son,Knud Eriksen Rud, who had taken over the house in 1502, constructed a new seat on the estate, probably completed in 1606 since that date features on the staircase tower of the main wing. Knud Rud married Ellen Marsvin on 1 January 1607 but died a few years later, in 1611, making her twice a widow at the age of 39. Before his death, Rud granted Rudbjerggaard to Marsvin's daughter by her first husband, Kirsten Munk, who would become morganatically married to the widowed King Christian IV in 1615. However, due to her young age, her mother, who was an accomplished business on the way to becoming one of the richest landowners in Denmark, managed the estate on her behalf, until selling it with the king's permission in 1616, probably due to its remote location. Up through the century, Rudbjerggaard grew considerably, although hit hard by the Swedish Wars. Most of the complex was demolished in the 18th and 19th century but the east wing was spared and later extended in both directions to form the present building. The large staircase tower is in masonry while the rest of the building is timber-framed. =Reventlow era= In 1891, the estate was acquired by Ludvig Eduard Alexander, Count of Reventlow, born at nearby Pederstrup Manor. He died in 1916 and is interred at nearby Tillitse Church ]. His widow kept the estate until her death in 1938. It then passed to their son Einar Ludvig August Reventlow. Architecture Rudbjerggaard seen from the air The current house is the main wing of Rud's originally three- or four- winged complex from 1606. It is built in timber framing, except for the octagonal staircase tower, which is in dressed masonry. The house is still surrounded by the original moats. Rudbjerggaard today Rudbjerggaard covers 459 hectares of farmland and 392 hectares of forest. Fredsholm covers 914 hectares of farmland and 129 hectares of forest.

He is now remembered for his approach to the problem of future contingents. Life He was born at Lavenham, Suffolk, and, after becoming a Carmelite friar at Ipswich, studied at the University of Oxford, where he is said to have graduated D.D.; but in the colophon to his tract against John Purvey he is called simply 'magister'. Lavenham was later prior of the Carmelite house at Bristol. Works Lavenham enjoyed a reputation as a theologian and schoolman. John Bale gives a list of sixty-one treatises ascribed to him, De Villiers names sixty-two, and Davy sixty-three. In Sloane MS. 3899 (fourteenth century) there are twenty-four short treatises by Lavenham on logical subjects ('De Propositionibus,' 'De Terminis,' &c.;). Other extant works ascribed to Lavenham are: * 'In Revelationes S. Brigitt√¶ Lib. vii.' in MS. Reg. 7, C. ix, in the British Library, a folio volume of the fifteenth century; the fourth book is also in Bodl. MS. 169 in the Bodleian Library. De Villiers describes this work as 'Determinationes notabiles Oxonii et Londini lect√¶' * 'Contra Johannem Purveium,' heresies extracted from Purvey's 'Ecclesi√¶ Regimen,' printed in 'Fasciculi Zizaniorum,' pp. 383‚Äì99. * 'Super Pr√¶dicamentis,' in Digby MS. 77, f. 191 b, mutilated at the end, inc.

Thomas Tanner ascribed this work both to Richard and to a Thomas Lavenham, who was in 1447 one of the first fellows of All Souls' College. * 'De Septem Peccatis Mortalibus,' an English treatise beginning 'Crist yt deyde upon ye crosse.' In Harleian MS. 211, ff. 35 a‚Äì46 b, an early fifteenth-century manuscript, with a contemporary ascription to Lavenham. * 'De Gestis et Translationibus sanctorum trium regum de Colonia,' ascribed to Lavenham by a late hand in Laud. MS. Misc. 525 in the Bodleian. This is in fact a once famous work by John of Hildesheim (fl. 1370), a German Carmelite; but there were several English translations, and Lavenham may have been the author of one of these. The Latin and two English versions were edited by C. Horstmann for the Early English Text Society in 1886. Among the other treatises given by De Villiers are 'Abbreviationes Bed√¶' (it has been suggested that this is the abbreviation printed by Abraham Wheloc in his edition of Bede), 'Compendium Gualteri Reclusi' (perhaps Walter Hilton), 'De Fundatione sui Ordinis,' a treatise called 'Clypeus Paupertatis' (suggesting Lavenham had taken part in the controversy concerning evangelical poverty), a commentary on Aristotle's 'Ethics,' tracts on physics and astronomy ('De C≈ìlo et Mundo,' 'De Proprietatibus Elementorum'), together with 'Qu√¶stiones,' sermons, and similar works.

The potato paradox is a mathematical calculation that has a counter-intuitive result. The Universal Book of Mathematics states the problem as such: In Quine's classification of paradoxes, the potato paradox is a veridical paradox.  Simple explanations  = Method 1 = One explanation begins by saying that initially the non-water weight is 1 kg, which is 1% of 100 kg. Then one asks: 1 kg is 2% of how many kg? In order for that percentage to be twice as big, the total weight must be half as big. = Method 2 = A visualisation where blue boxes represent kg of water and the orange boxes represent kg of solid potato matter. Left, prior to dehydration: 1 kg matter, 99 kg water (99% water). Middle: 1 kg matter, 49 kg water (98% water). In the beginning (left figure), there is 1 part of non-water and 99 parts of water. This is 99% water, or a non-water to water ratio of 1:99. To double the ratio of non-water to water to 1:49, while keeping the one part of non-water, the amount of water must be reduced to 49 parts (middle figure). This is equivalent to 2 part of non-water to 98 parts water (98% water) (right figure). In 100 kg of potatoes, 99% water (by weight) means that there is 99 kg of water, and 1 kg of solids. This is a 1:99 ratio. If the percentage decreases to 98%, then the solids must now account for 2% of the weight: a ratio of 2:98, or 1:49. Since the solids still weigh 1 kg, the water must weigh 49 kg to produce a total of 50 kg.  Explanations using algebra  = Method 1 = After the evaporating of the water, the remaining total quantity, x, contains 1 kg pure potatoes and (98/100)x water. The equation becomes: : \\\\begin{align} 1 + \\\\frac{98}{100}x &= x  \\\\Longrightarrow 1 &= \\\\frac{1}{50}x \\\\end{align} resulting in x = 50 kg. = Method 2 = The weight of water in the fresh potatoes is 0.99 \\\\cdot 100. If x is the weight of water lost from the potatoes when they dehydrate then 0.98(100 - x) is the weight of water in the dehydrated potatoes. Therefore: : 0.99 \\\\cdot 100 - 0.98(100 - x) = x Expanding brackets and simplifying : \\\\begin{align} 99 - (98 - 0.98x) &= x  99 - 98 + 0.98x &= x  1 + 0.98x &= x \\\\end{align} Subtracting the smaller x term from each side : \\\\begin{align} 1 + 0.98x - 0.98x &= x - 0.98x  1 &= 0.02x \\\\end{align} Which gives the lost water as: : 50 = x And the dehydrated weight of the potatoes as: : 100 - x = 100 - 50 = 50 = Method 3 = After the potatoes are dehydrated, the potatoes are 98% water. This implies that the percentage of non-water weight of the potatoes is (1 - .98). If x is the weight of the potatoes after dehydration, then: : \\\\begin{align} (1-.98)x &= 1  .02x &= 1  x &= \\\\frac{1}{.02}  x &= 50 \\\\end{align}  Implication  The answer is the same as long as the concentration of the non-water part is doubled. For example, if the potatoes were originally 99.999% water, reducing the percentage to 99.998% still requires halving the weight.  The Language Paradox  We imagine, from the initial query, that we are reducing weight by 1%. This is not the case. If it were, we would be right that we would then have 99 kg of potatoes (99.01 kg if you reduce 1% of the 99 kg of water; 99 kg if you reduce the total weight by 1% by removing 1kg of water ‚Äì how it is worded makes all the difference!). But reducing water so that it is then 98% of the whole new weight of the potatoes means that we are eliminating half (actually a bit over half ‚Äì 50/99) of the water so that the potato solids are then 2% of the total weight. The paradox, then, is not in the math, but in our understanding of the language used to define the question. Careful wording must be used to ensure that the \\"paradox\\" is correct.

Soldiers with the 311th Expeditionary Sustainment Command conducted the training to prepare for the possibility of an active shooter. An insider threat is a malicious threat to an organization that comes from people within the organization, such as employees, former employees, contractors or business associates, who have inside information concerning the organization's security practices, data and computer systems. The threat may involve fraud, the theft of confidential or commercially valuable information, the theft of intellectual property, or the sabotage of computer systems. The insider threat comes in three categories: * Malicious insiders, which are people who take advantage of their access to inflict harm on an organization; * Negligent insiders, which are people who make errors and disregard policies, which place their organizations at risk; and * Infiltrators, who are external actors that obtain legitimate access credentials without authorization.  Overview  Insiders may have accounts giving them legitimate access to computer systems, with this access originally having been given to them to serve in the performance of their duties; these permissions could be abused to harm the organization. Insiders are often familiar with the organization's data and intellectual property as well as the methods that are in place to protect them. This makes it easier for the insider to circumvent any security controls of which they are aware. Physical proximity to data means that the insider does not need to hack into the organizational network through the outer perimeter by traversing firewalls; rather they are in the building already, often with direct access to the organization's internal network. Insider threats are harder to defend against than attacks from outsiders, since the insider already has legitimate access to the organization's information and assets. An insider may attempt to steal property or information for personal gain or to benefit another organization or country. The threat to the organization could also be through malicious software left running on its computer systems by former employees, a so-called logic bomb. Research centers Insider threat is an active area of research in academia and government. The CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie-Mellon University maintains the CERT Insider Threat Center, which includes a database of more than 850 cases of insider threats, including instances of fraud, theft and sabotage; the database is used for research and analysis. CERT's Insider Threat Team also maintains an informational blog to help organizations and businesses defend themselves against insider crime.  Research findings  In a 2018 insider threat report whitepaper, it was determined that 53% of companies surveyed had confirmed insider attacks against their organization in the previous 12 months, with 27% saying insider attacks have become more frequent. A report published in July 2012 on the insider threat in the U.S. financial sector gives some statistics on insider threat incidents: 80% of the malicious acts were committed at work during working hours; 81% of the perpetrators planned their actions beforehand; 33% of the perpetrators were described as \\"difficult\\" and 17% as being \\"disgruntled\\". The insider was identified in 74% of cases. Financial gain was a motive in 81% of cases, revenge in 23% of cases, and 27% of the people carrying out malicious acts were in financial difficulties at the time. The US Department of Defense Personnel Security Research Center published a report that describes approaches for detecting insider threats.

Munif relocated to Iraq in 1977 and became a leading member of the Iraqi Ba'ath. Munif was among dozens of dissidents accused of plotting against then new Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the 1979 Ba'ath Party Purge. King Hussein had advocated for Munif's release so he can return safely to Jordan, but President Saddam Hussein adamantly refused. Munif died in 1984 during his house arrest in Baghdad, his family claims he was assassinated by the Iraqi Ba'ath after his hypertension medicine was replaced with poison. He was buried in Amman according to his only will. Biography =Early years= Razzaz was born in Syria in 1919 but he was raised in Jordan. His family moved to Jordan in 1925 after his father, a veterinarian, was accused by the French authorities in Syria of collaborating with the rebels during the Great Syrian Revolt by treating their injured horses. In 1937 Razzaz was given scholarship at the American University in Beirut after having spent a brief period studying in Cairo. He became a member of the Jordanian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1950. Razzaz was one of the co-founders of the Ba'athist Regional Branch in Jordan, and he promoted the Ba'athist ideology through his writings in national newspapers. From 1955 to 1957, the Jordanian Ba'athists were loud critics of King Hussein. Razzaz criticised the King Hussein's support of the Baghdad Pact, and his stance towards Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt. Because of his anti-monarchy activities Razzaz was imprisoned in 1956, 1958, 1959 and 1960. In the aftermath of the Ramadan Revolution which brought the Iraqi Ba'ath Branch to power in Iraq, Razzaz along with fellow Ba'athist Abdallah abd al-Da'im, was given the task of formulating a political programme which was supposed to be broadcast to the Iraqi people. =National Command= Razzaz was elected Secretary General of the National Command at the 8th National Congress in April 1965, and succeeded Michel Aflaq in office. However, Razzaz was not rooted enough in Syrian affairs to find a solution to the crisis which was taking hold in Syria. In November 1965, the National Command passed a resolution which forbade the Syrian Regional Command to appoint or relieve officers. The Military Committee led by Salah Jadid responded immediately by rebelling. Razzaz then convened an emergency session of the National Command which decreed the dissolution of Yusuf Zu'ayyin's government and the Syrian Regional Command, while they decreed the establishment of a new leadership for Syria; al-Bitar became Prime Minister, Muhammad Umran became Minister of Defence, Amin al-Hafiz became Chairman of a new Presidential Council, and Mansur al-Atrash became Chairman of the National Revolutionary Council. Jadid and his supporters replied by carrying out the 1966 Syrian coup d'√©tat which led to the downfall of the National Command and the moderate faction within the Ba'ath Party. =Later years= Following the downfall of Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar and the moderates in general in the 1966 coup, Razzaz went underground. He became the only member of the old National Command to put up any resistance against Jadid's neo-Ba'athist government. On his ascension to office, Razzaz relationship with Aflaq deteriorated even if it was the Military Committee, and not Razzaz, who forced him from office. Shortly after the 1966 coup, Colonel Salim Hatum began planning a conspiracy which would topple the Jadid government. Hatum forged an alliance with Razzaz, encouraged by messages from comrades from the old National Command, began recruiting military officers to his cause. He managed to form a Military Committee led by Druze officer Major General Fahd al- Sha'ir. The coup was uncovered by the authorities in August 1966, and Razzaz and fellow conspirators were forced either into hiding or into Lebanon. Razzaz was highly critical of the Syrian regime of Hafez al Assad, writing an exposure book, Al Tajribah al Murrah The Bitter Experience, published in 1966. He became a member of the Palestinian Iraqi-aligned Ba'athist organisation Arab Liberation Front in 1966, and through it, rose through the Iraqi- dominated Ba'athist structure. =Alleged assassination= In 1977, Munif relocated to Iraq and became a leading member of the Iraqi Ba'ath. He was among dozens of dissidents accused of plotting against then new Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the 1979 Ba'ath Party Purge. King Hussein had advocated for Munif's release so he can return safely to Jordan, but President Saddam Hussein adamantly refused. Munif died in 1984 after being poisoned during his house arrest in Baghdad. He puked blood in front of his wife and daughter, apparently after his hypertension medicine was replaced with poison. Thought In the article \\"Ba'ath Socialism\\" in the Iraqi newspaper Iraq Today Razzaz stated that Ba'athist socialism was scientific socialism, and that it \\"was the natural and inevitable response to the contradictions between the Arab nation and home land, with colonialism, imperialism and backwardness, both inherited and recent. It is a natural response to natural struggle blended with class struggle.\\" Razzaz laid emphasis on the fact that Ba'athist socialism was both scientific and moral, and that Ba'athist socialism was a form of Third World Socialism and not the form of socialism of the First, Second, Third or Fourth Internationals. These forms of socialism derived \\"their character from pure class contradictions inside imperialist industrialised societies. It is a socialism which draws its basic properties from the contradictions of the Third World with imperialism on the one hand, and backwardness on the other\\". Ba'athist socialism, in his mind, opposed full state ownership of the economy, but supported state ownership over the heights of the economy. In his influential 1957 article \\"Why Socialism Now?\\" Razzaz states; \\"Socialism is a way of life, not just an economic order. It extends to all aspects of life ‚Äì economics, politics, training, education, social life, health, morals, literature, science, history, and others both great and small. Socialism, freedom and unity are not different names for different things ... but different facets of one basic law from which they spring.\\" Together with Aflaq and Jamal al-Atassi, Razzaz wrote Articles on Socialism in 1974. In a paper entitled \\"Arab nationalism\\" Razzaz asserts that Arab nationalist ideology is \\"the driving force behind the Arabs in their struggle to create a progressive nation that can hold on its own with the nations of the world.\\" Razzaz believed that the Arabs had a sense of belonging to an Arab identity which could be traced back to pre-Islamic days. He believed that the Arab world was first confronted by Western colonialism at the beginning of the 16th century in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. The 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War \\"which brought the humiliating defeat of the Arabs by a handful of Jews, was the last straw that destroyed any remnants of confidence between the ruling classes on one side and the masses on the other.\\" Resentments towards the Western powers for creating Israel could never be forgotten Razzaz believed, and the creation of Israel led to the popular demand of an end to all Western tutelage in the Arab world. Razzaz claimed that Arab nationalism was the conflict between two forces; the reactionary classes and the masses. The reactionary classes were inefficient vassals of Western capitalist imperialism who had betrayed the nation, while the masses were \\"anti-imperialist, anti- capitalist and anti-Zionist, and in favour of unity, freedom, socialism and neutralism.\\" Personal life His son Omar Razzaz was the Prime Minister of Jordan from 2018 to 2020.

In a racing career lasting from May 1956 until July 1957, the filly ran seven times and won three races for her owner Queen Elizabeth II. As a three-year-old she finished fourth in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket before winning Oaks at Epsom. She was retired to stud after one further race and had some success as a broodmare. Background Carrozza was a dark-coated bay or brown filly bred by the British national Stud and leased for racing purposes to the British monarch, Elizabeth II. The filly was sired by Dante the winner of the 1945 Epsom Derby out of the mare Calash, a daughter of Hyperion. Calash was a sister of the outstanding racemare Sun Chariot who won three Classics for King George VI in 1942, and of Sister Sarah, the grandam of Santa Claus. The Queen sent her filly into training with Noel Murless at his Warren Place stables in Newmarket. Racing career Carrozza began her racing career in May 1956 when she won the Rosemary Plate at Hurst Park Racecourse. The filly missed most of the season after falling in a training accident and injuring her back so severely that she was confined to her box for six weeks. Carrozza did not reappear until October, when she finished fourth in the Prendergast Stakes and fourth again in the Criterion Stakes at the same course two weeks later. On her three-year-old debut, Carrozza contested the Princess Elizabeth Stakes at Epsom in April. She won the race, a trial for the fillies Classics, by defeating the highly regarded French filly Rose Royale by half a length. In the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket less than two weeks later, Carrozza started favourite at odds of 4/1 and finished fourth of the twenty runners behind Rose Royale, Sensualita and Angelet. In the Oaks at Epsom a month later, Carrozza, ridden by Lester Piggott, started at odds of 100/8 in a field of eleven runners, being less fancied than the Queen's other runner, Mulberry Harbour. Piggott sent Carrozza into the lead a furlong from the finish and looked set for a comfortable win until the Irish-trained grey Silken Glider emerged with a late challenge. In a \\"desperate finish\\" the royal filly prevailed by a short head after a photo-finish. The favourite Rose Royale, who appeared unsuited by the firm ground, finished three lengths further back in third. Carrozza was led into the winner's circle by her owner: the filly was initially reluctant but acquiesced after the Queen gave the lead strap a \\"mighty jerk\\". Later in the year, Silken Glider was successful in the Irish Oaks, while Rose Royale won the Prix du Moulin and the Champion Stakes. In July, Carrozza started odds-on favourite for the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood, but finished fourth behind Swallowswift. Carrozza returned from the race lame and was retired to stud. Carrozza's prize of ¬£16,101 for winning the Oaks, enabled the Queen to be the leading owner in Britain in 1957. Retirement Carrozza began her breeding career at the National stud, before being sold for 20,000 guineas to the British Bloodstock Agency in 1964. She produced three minor winners including Battle Wagon, who was exported to New Zealand where he sired the Wellington Cup winner Battle Heights. Carrozza's daughter, Caromata, produced the Grand Prix de Paris winner Matahawk. Carrozza was exported to the United States in 1966 and to Argentina in 1975. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Carrozza an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks.

The outer coin has made a full rotation having come back to the same position after only rotating about half of the inner coin. Fully rotating around the inner coin it will have completed 2 rotations. The path of a single point on the edge of the moving coin is a cardioid. The coin rotation paradox is the counter-intuitive observation that, when one coin is rolled around the rim of another coin of equal size, the moving coin completes two full rotations after going all the way around the stationary coin. Description Start with two identical coins touching each other on a table, with their \\"head\\" sides displayed and parallel. Keeping coin A stationary, rotate coin B around A, keeping a point of contact with no slippage. As coin B reaches the opposite side, the two heads will again be parallel; B has made one revolution. Continuing to move B brings it back to the starting position and completes a second revolution. Paradoxically, coin B has rolled a distance equal to twice its circumference. As coin B rotates, each point on its perimeter describes (moves through) a cardioid curve. Comparison The rolling coin participates in two separate motions like the moon relative to the earth (except that the moon completes only one rotation about every 28 days). The moon rotates once while revolving around an elliptical pathway relative to true north while the moving coin rotates twice as it revolves around the center of the other (still) coin. Sliding over a circle, without rotation Analysis and Solution From start to end the center of the moving coin travels a circular path. The edge of the stationary coin and said path form two concentric circles. The radius of the path is twice either coin's radius. Hence, the circumference of the path is twice either coin's circumference. To go all the way around the stationary coin, the center of the moving coin must travel twice the coin's circumference. How much the moving coin rotates around its own center en route, if any, or in what direction ‚Äì clockwise, counterclockwise, or some of both ‚Äì has no effect on the length of the path. That the coin rotates twice as described above and focusing on the edge of the moving coin as it touches the stationary coin are distractions. Unequal radii and other shapes Visualisation for coins of unequal radii [ (animation)] A coin of radius r rolling around one of radius R makes R/r + 1 rotations.Two Circles Math Problem That is because the center of the rolling coin travels a circular path with a radius (or circumference) of (R + r)/r = R/r + 1 times its own radius (or circumference). In the limiting case when R = 0, the coin with radius r makes 0/r + 1 = 1 simple rotation around its bottom point. In the example in the figure, R = 3r. In figure 1, with R straightened out, the number of rotations (number of times the arrow points upward) is R/r = 3. In figure 2, as R has been restored into a circle, the coin makes an extra rotation, giving R/r + 1 = 4. The May 1st, 1982 SAT had a question concerning this problem, and, due to human error, had to be regraded after 3 students proved there was no correct answer among the choices.https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/25/us/error-found-in-sat-question.html The shape around which the coin is rolled need not be a circle: one extra rotation is added to the ratio of their perimeters when it is any simple polygon or closed curve which does not intersect itself. If the shape is complex, the number of rotations added (or subtracted, if the coin rolls inside the curve) is the absolute value of its turning number.

She has played for the British national team, and competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Early life McCafferty was born in Coatbridge on 15 April 1979, and grew up in the North Lanarkshire town of Cumbernauld, part of the Glasgow metropolitan area in Scotland. She attended Our Lady's High School in Cumbernauld, which was also attended by Scotland footballer and fellow 2012 Olympian Ifeoma Dieke. Career McCafferty began playing handball at the age of ten, when she joined the Tryst 77 handball club in Cumbernauld. After progressing through the club's ranks, she was selected for the first team at the age of fifteen, making her debut in the now-defunct British League. In August 2006, McCafferty left Cumbernauld and moved to Denmark, together with four male Tryst 77 players including husband Gary McCafferty. The purpose of the move was to receive training in elite facilities in Denmark, a country where handball is a popular spectator sport and receives greater attention than in the United Kingdom, boosting their chances of selection for the 2012 Olympic Games in London. The players were among 61 Scottish recipients of a grant for athletes from the National Lottery and they were trained at the Aarhus Sports Academy by Carsten Albrektsen, the coach of Danish club Bjerringbro-Silkeborg, who had been recruited by Team GB to help train potential Olympic players. As well as training McCafferty began playing competitively in Denmark, for the Nyborg GIF club in the country's third division. In 2009, funding for the training programme in Denmark ceased, and McCafferty had to look for professional a contract to continue her career. After initially moving to Norway, McCafferty eventually spent the 2009‚Äì10 season in Italy, playing for the SSV Brixen club in the country's second tier, taking advantage of the club's intensive training regime and increased game play to improve her skills and fitness. The following season she returned to Denmark, starting the 2010‚Äì11 season with Hadsten Sports Klub H√•ndbold of the second division before moving mid-season to Aarhus-based AGF H√•ndbold, who played in the Danish 1st Division, the country's second tier. From at least 2008, McCafferty was selected as captain of the Great Britain women's national handball team, which had not previously competed and was formed with the specific goal of competing at the 2012 Olympics. Like McCafferty, many of the national team's elite players had trained at Aarhus and then played in the leagues of various European countries. In late 2010, British Handball reached a deal allowing the team to train at the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre from the end of the season in May 2011. The players were not fully funded, and were expected to seek outside employment, but the deal allowed the team to train and play together on a regular basis for a year prior to the 2012 Games. McCafferty went on to captain the Great Britain side in the 2012 Olympics. The team lost the opener at the Copper Box Arena on 28 July against Montenegro, their first ever Olympic game, by a score of 31‚Äì19, but the team played well and the match was close until the final ten minutes when the Montenegrans took advantage of British fatigue. McCafferty was among the scorers in the game, and later praised the side's performance in an interview with BBC Sport. The team went on to lose the remainder of their games in Group A of the tournament, and were eliminated from the competition. McCafferty retired after the Olympics, and returned home to Cumbernauld.

It had a high braced wing, built around two spruce spars. The ribs were made of spruce and birch with steel wire internal bracing. Its leading and trailing edges were metal, with fabric elsewhere. The wing was braced on either side by pairs of V-form, steel struts mounted on the lower fuselage longerons. The fuselage was a chrome molybdenum steel tube structure, fabric covered over plywood formers and spruce stringers. The enclosed cabin, which seated two side-by-side with dual control, was under the wing, with the 90 hp (67 kW) single row radial LeBlond engine mounted immediately ahead of it under a clean NACA cowling in the short nose. The tail unit was metal framed and fabric covered. The tailplane was externally braced and the elevators carried trim tabs. The fin was straight edged but the rudder, which extended to the bottom of the fuselage and worked in a cut-out between the elevators, had a full, curved trailing edge. The Swift had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with faired main legs and wheels, rubber shock absorbers and half-axles hinged under the fuselage. The main wheels had brakes and the tailwheel was steerable.

As a member of the Christian Liberation Movement (MCL) in 2003, he was the oriental leader for collecting signatures among the Varela Project, in which 25,000 signatories petitioned the Cuban government to guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of assembly as well as institute a multi-party democracy. Jos√© Daniel got in prison in 2003 for his participation as a leader of the Varela Project, sentenced to 25 years. In prison from 2003 to 2011, he was declared a prisoner of conscience for the Black Spring of Cuba by Amnesty International. Son of Daniel Ferrer and Amelia Garc√≠a, he has three children with his ex-wife Belkis Cantillo Ram√≠rez: Martha Beatriz, Jos√© Daniel, F√°tima Victoria. He is the founder of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), which is an umbrella group that has hosted since 2011 many Cuban dissident organizations, a union that was extended with the merger of the Guillermo Fari√±as organization in 2013, which was absorbed by UNPACU. Jos√© Daniel Ferrer Garc√≠a was appointed in February 2013 Executive Secretary of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) by all members of the UNPACU and still remains as Executive Secretary. However, years later, following the announcement of the reestablishment of Diplomatic relations between the Governments of the United States of America and Cuba, some organizations decided to separate in friendly terms and each return to their original organization, and so Jose Daniel Ferrer resumed in front of UNPACU, while between December 2014 and January 2015, Guillermo Farinas and Felix Navarro and their respective organizations left UNPACU. Within the opposition to the Cuban government is characterized by its willingness, through the creation of sufficient \\"social mass\\" that \\"through non-violent struggle forces the government to sit at the negotiating table‚Äù, to achieve an \\"equal to equal and serious\\" dialogue in order to achieve the so-called \\"national reconciliation\\" and avoid any kind of \\"fraticide\\".  2003 arrest  Ferrer was detained during the subsequent Black Spring crackdown of March 2003 and sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for being one of the main promoters of the Varela Project. His brother Luis Enrique Ferrer Garc√≠a, also an MCL activist by then, was sentenced to 28 years. In May 2003, Jos√© Daniel began a hunger strike after he was allegedly refused medical treatment for an intestinal issue. He was also subjected to punishment cells for refusing to stand in the presence of military or prison guards. The prison cells are reportedly and habitually below the international standard and the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Amnesty International declared both Ferrer brothers to be prisoners of conscience. US President Barack Obama called for Ferrer's release in 2009, urging the Cuban government to allow him to \\"fully participate in a democratic future in Cuba.\\" Ferrer remained in prison until 2011. He and F√©lix Navarro Rodr√≠guez were released on 23 March 2011 as part of an agreement between the Cuban government and the Catholic Church. They were the last two prisoners of the Black Spring to be released. Ferrer refused the option to emigrate to Spain, stating, \\"I want to see a free people, and the best place to fight is here inside.\\"  Jail release  Jos√© Daniel Ferrer received, like the rest of the prisoners of the Group called ‚Äúthe 75‚Äù (‚ÄúGrupo de los 75‚Äù), the option of being released in exchange for leaving Cuba to Spain, due to the pressure of the international public opinion after the death in the prison of the political prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo, on February 23, 2010, and the following hunger strike of Guillermo Fari√±as, who demanded that the Cuban government release the sick political prisoners. But Jos√© Daniel was one of the 12 prisoners of conscience who assumed his sentence, and refused to be forced to leave Cuba for being released, and in 2011 he still remained in prison along with very few colleagues of the 75, being finally released by the Cuban government along with F√©lix Navarro Rodr√≠guez, the last two prisoners of conscience of the Group of the 75 in prison, on March 22, 2011. On August 24, 2011, already released from jail, and in Cuba, he created the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU). Ferrer was detained again in April 2012 for \\"public disorder\\", and again for two days in August 2012 for his work with Uni√≥n Patri√≥tica de Cuba (UNPACU). Amnesty International described the arrests as part of \\"a pattern of harassment by the Cuban authorities against UNPACU members and other political dissidents.\\" During the period of growth of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), and among numerous detentions of Jos√© Daniel Ferrer that were considered political by several reputed human rights organizations, the Patriotic Union of Cuba, on February 27, 2013, communicates the absorption of the peaceful dissident organization FANTU, one of the less numerous in the island but most notorious outside Cuba, led by then by Guillermo Fari√±as, and also a multitude of other opposition organizations within the island through the integration of many of its most notorious leaders, including 8 of the 12 prisoners of conscience of the Group of 75 who decided to remain in Cuba. In the process of merging FANTU and UNPACU, Jose Daniel Ferrer and Guillermo Fari√±as promulgated in a press note that the head of the new organization should be collegiate, stating \\"that their leadership will be collegially as a practical way to combat chieftainship\\". Jos√© Daniel Ferrer Garc√≠a was appointed in February 2013 Executive Secretary of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) by all members of the UNPACU and still remains as Executive Secretary.  Travel discrimination  Since his release from prison, Jos√© Daniel Ferrer has been refused by the Cuban Government, until only once in 2016, to travel abroad, under his condition of having an extrapenal license, despite the fact that other opposition personalities have been able to do so and that the government has informed that anyone with Cuban passport could travel outside the island, since in mid-October 2012 the decree amending the immigration law in Cuba, which previously made it difficult to travel outside the island, was made official.  Daily repression  Jos√© Daniel Ferrer's himself and his relatives, including his wife and children, as well as other members of the Cuban Patriotic Union have received the support of Amnesty International and the World Organization against Torture on numerous occasions for having been arrested, robbed of their homes and retained in an unknown whereabouts after police detentions. The international pressure of several human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and others, has always borne fruit in the liberation, time and again, of Jos√© Daniel Ferrer. Identified as a relevant personality of Cuban dissidence, having unified several organizations inside the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), and identified this as the most active dissident organization throughout the island, both Jos√© Daniel Ferrer and the activists of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) have been threatened with imprisonment if they do not cease their political activism.  Recognition  In 2009, Ferrer and fellow Cuban dissidents Librado Linares Garc√≠a, Iv√°n Hern√°ndez Carrillo, Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez, and Iris P√©rez Aguilera were jointly awarded the Democracy Award of the US National Endowment for Democracy. Ferrer was unable to attend, as he was still in prison. In 2011, he received the XIII International Award on Human Rights of the Cuban-Hispanic Foundation, in Madrid. Spanish and Latin-american media claim him to be \\"the visible head of the dissident movement in the interior of the island since the death of Oswaldo Pay√°, in July 2012‚Äù.  Personal life  Ferrer's wife, Cantillo Belkis Ramirez, is a member of the Ladies in White, a group of wives of political prisoners protesting every Sunday for their release. She was herself detained for 48 hours in March 2012.

The station opened on 8 August 1870 by the Caledonian Railway on a line constructed from the Caledonian Railway Main Line at Kirtlebridge across the Glasgow South Western Line, then forming the Solway Junction Railway over the Solway Viaduct to Brayton. The line opened in 1869 and freight had run since 13 September 1869.  History  Bowness was opened by the Solway Junction Railway, then part of the Caledonian Railway The passenger service was never well patronised and reduced to being just one carriage at the front of an occasional goods train and in September 1917 this was suspended, but was reinstated in 1920. Passenger services were finally withdrawn in 1921 and the line south of Annan over the Solway Viaduct was closed completely. The station was only built as an afterthought following a petition from local people. It had two platforms, a signal box, cattle pens and an overbridge at the northern end. Old photographs show a carriage body on one platform as a shelter, etc. In 1910 a watertank was located next to the overbridge and the platform beside the signal box had no buildings, not even a passenger shelter. In 1915 the signalbox was open from 4 am to 8:30 pm. Disused, the station became the property of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 until sold together with the viaduct. =The Solway railway viaduct= Beyond Bowness station the railway ran along an embankment and then crossed the estuary of the Solway upon an iron girder viaduct, one mile 176 yards in length.

The piece is dedicated to Ni√±o Ricardo who was de Lucia's \\"first hero\\" of the guitar. The piece is a sole√° and is known for its technically demanding passages. It is played in the key of C major, but a significant part of the composition features the phrygian E and a E 7 flat 9 chord and it features elaborate tremolo picking at the beginning. However, when performing it live, Lucia often played it in the key of D flat major with a capo on the first fret.
