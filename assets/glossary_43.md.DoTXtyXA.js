The goal was for Marcos to gain full authoritarian control of the country during his declaration of martial law in 1972. Marcos gave the military leadership powers during martial law, taking over from democratically elected officials and court judges. The twelve were responsible for many human rights atrocities, although the extent of their responsibility is still being investigated. These atrocities include torture, murder, seizures of property, displacement from homes, and arrest and detention without due process. The origin of the name Rolex 12 came from a widespread story and some sources that each associate received a Rolex watch from Marcos himself, although this remains unverified. Some contend that the gifts were actually Omega watches, but despite this confusion, the name Rolex 12 stuck and is still used to refer to these twelve Marcos associates.

He is currently member of the Expediency Discernment Council. Early life and education Harandi was born in Gorgan in 1953. He is the nephew of Reza Saffar Harandi, who assassinated Hassan Ali Mansoor, then Iran's prime minister, in 1965. He graduated from the Iran University of Science and Technology with a degree in civil engineering in 1973. He obtained his master's degree in military sciences in 1993 and completed a certificate on strategic management in 1994. Career Harandi was deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Hormozgan (1981), Kerman and other provinces. From 1980 to 1983 he held the post of national regional deputy commander of the IRGC. He was the director of the IRGC's political office from 1989 to 1993. In the beginning of 1989, on the occasion of the death and funeral of Hirohito, the 124th Emperor of Japan who had ruled for over 60 years until he died on January 7, Harandi and Mostafa Mir-Salim, Vice President, went to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo to attend the Rites of Imperial Funeral on February 24 with Mohammad Hossein Adeli, Ambassador Extraordinary Plenipotentiary in Japan, and his wife.Diplomatic Blue Book: the Year of 1989 - 5.

Harandi was removed from office on 26 July 2009. Amid reports of his dismissal he said he was resigning. \\"Unfortunately due to the recent events which show the esteemed government's weakness, I will no longer consider myself the minister of culture and will not show up at the ministry as of tomorrow,\\" he said in a letter of resignation carried by the Fars news agency. Analysts described his termination as significant because of his being \\"especially close\\" to Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and connected to Harandi's support of Khamenei's order to Ahmadinejad to not appoint Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei as vice president. Following his dismissal, Harandi returned to the IRGC as brigadier general. =Views= As culture minister, Harandi, had a negative opinion of music. When he assumed his post, he stated that one of the first issues that he would combat would be the types of music that are against the values of the Republic of Iran, including rock and rap. He called upon Iranian musicians to produce purposeful and meaningful music. One result was the composition and production of a \\"nuclear symphony\\" in support of Iran's right to develop a nuclear program for peaceful purposes. Safar-Harandi were infuriated over Ahmadinejad's remarks. He was recently seen at an opposition meeting with leading figures.

The Chandeleur Islands () are a chain of uninhabited barrier islands approximately long, located in the Gulf of Mexico, marking the outer boundary of the Chandeleur Sound. They form the easternmost point of the state of Louisiana, United States and are a part of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge. They are an important migrating point for many birds on their way south, and are a prime marsh and forest wildlife area. History The islands were formed over 2,000 years ago as the rim of the St. Bernard Lobe of the Mississippi River delta. The islands were named when explorer, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, was sailing in search of the mouth of the Mississippi River along the Gulf Coast. He christened the islands on the eve of F√™te de la Chandeleur‚Äîalso known as Candlemas, a Christian feast day‚Äîon February 1, 1700.Chandeleur Island Lighthouse, Louisiana at Lighthousefriends.com The Breton National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1904 and includes all of the Chandeleur Islands in the Gulf of Mexico. The refuge is the second-oldest in the National Wildlife Refuge System. Prior to destruction by a hurricane in 1915 there was a fishing settlement on the islands, and even earlier there had been farming on the islands. The Chandeleur Island Light, built in 1895, stood as a landmark and recognizable location for mariners at sea and pilots flying over the Gulf of Mexico. The islands were constantly eroded and changed by wave action, and most dramatically after the storm surges following hurricanes. The islands have been generally shrinking and migrating landward since the late 19th century. A survey in the 1980s estimated that they would be in existence for about three more centuries. Before 1996, the seaward front of the islands lost about 20‚Äì30 feet of land each year, mostly replaced at the rear. From 1996 to 2004, the loss rate grew to about per year. In 1998, Hurricane Georges destroyed the islands and left the lighthouse in the middle of the ocean, and the barrier islands only just recovered when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 29, 2005. Chandeleur Islands Timelapse from 1984-2016 However, the combined effect of Hurricane Dennis and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 reduced the island to shoals or sub-surface formations, and toppled the Chandeleur Island Light. Powerful storms can produce changes that would otherwise have taken many years. A study released in 2006 by geologists from the University of New Orleans shows that the usual sand and sediment patterns that rebuilt the islands after big storms have not been restored since Katrina reworked the area. There is also evidence of unprecedented landslides on the seafloor on the side toward the Gulf of Mexico, potentially allowing stronger waves with greater erosional impact to reach the islands. Numerical models developed by other marine geologists indicate the islands could be mostly submerged within decades due to sea level rise, isolation from Mississippi River delta sediment, mud foundations, sediment transport issues, and damaging storms.

The works are for the most part in free time (lacking time signatures or bar divisions) and highly experimental with form, rhythm and chordal structure. The form as well as the term was invented by Satie. Etymology Satie's coining of the word gnossienne was one of the rare occasions when a composer used a new term to indicate a new \\"type\\" of composition. Satie used many novel names for his compositions (vexations, and so on). Ogive, for example, is the name of an architectural element which was used by Satie as the name for a composition, the Ogives. Gnossienne, however, was a word that did not exist before Satie used it as a title for a composition. The word appears to derive from gnosis. Satie was involved in gnostic sects and movements at the time that he began to compose the Gnossiennes. However, some published versions claim that the word derives from Cretan \\"knossos\\" or \\"gnossus\\"; this interpretation supports the theory linking the Gnossiennes to the myth of Theseus, Ariadne and the Minotaur. Several archeological sites relating to that theme were famously excavated around the time that Satie composed the Gnossiennes. It is possible that Satie may have drawn inspiration for the title of these compositions from a passage in John Dryden's 1697 translation of the Aeneid, in which it is thought the word first appeared: > Let us the land which Heav'n appoints, explore; Appease the winds, and seek > the Gnossian shore.Dryden, John, The Works of Virgil: Containing his > Pastorals, Georgics, and Aeneis. London: Jacob Tonson, 1697. Book III, line > 153. Characteristics The Gnossiennes were composed by Satie in the decade following the composition of the Sarabandes (1887) and the (1888). Like these and Gymnop√©dies, the Gnossiennes are often considered dances. It is not certain that this qualification comes from Satie himself ‚Äì the sarabande and the gymnopaedia were at least historically known as dances. The musical vocabulary of the Gnossiennes is a continuation of that of the Gymnop√©dies (a development that had started with the 1886 Ogives and the Sarabandes) later leading to more harmonic experimentation in compositions like the Danses gothiques (1893). These series of compositions are all at the core of Satie's characteristic late 19th century style, and in this sense differ from his early salon compositions (like the 1885 \\"Waltz\\" compositions published in 1887), his turn-of-the-century cabaret songs (Je te veux), and his post-Schola Cantorum piano solo compositions, starting with the Pr√©ludes flasques in 1912.  Gnossiennes These Three Gnossiennes were composed around 1890 and first published in 1893. A revision prior to publication in 1893 is not unlikely; the 2nd Gnossienne may even have been composed in that year (it has \\"April 1893\\" as date on the manuscript). The piano solo versions of the first three Gnossiennes are without time signatures or bar lines, which is known as free time. These Gnossiennes were first published in Le Figaro musical No. 24 of September 1893 (Gnossiennes Nos. 1 and 3, the last one of these then still \\"No. 2\\") and in No. 6‚Äì7 of September‚ÄìOctober 1893 (Gnossienne No. 2 printed as facsimile, then numbered \\"No. 6\\"). The first grouped publication, numbered as known henceforth, followed in 1913. By this time Satie had indicated 1890 as composition date for all three. The first Gnossienne was dedicated to Alexis Roland-Manuel in the 1913 reprint. The 1893 facsimile print of the 2nd Gnossienne contained a dedication to Antoine de La Rochefoucauld, not repeated in the 1913 print. This de La Rochefoucauld had been a co-founder of Jos√©phin P√©ladan's Ordre de la Rose-Croix Catholique et Esthetique du Temple et du Graal in 1891. By the second publication of the first set of three Gnossiennes, Satie had broken already for a long time with all Rosicrucian type of endeavours. Also with respect to the tempo these Gnossiennes follow the Gymnop√©dies line: slow tempos, respectively (French for Lento/slow), (\\"with astonishment\\"), and again . A sketch containing only two incomplete bars, dated around 1890, shows Satie beginning to orchestrate the 3rd Gnossienne. The first and third Gnossiennes share a similar chordal structures, rhythm and share reference to each other's thematic material. Gnossiennes Nos. 4‚Äì7 The Gnossiennes Nos. 4‚Äì6 were published only in 1968, long after Satie's death. None of these appear to have been numbered, not even titled as \\"Gnossienne\\" by Satie himself. The sequence of these three Gnossiennes in the 1968 publication by Robert Caby does not correspond with the chronological order of composition. It is extremely unlikely that Satie would have seen these compositions as three members of a single set. =Gnossienne No. 4= Lent. Composition date on the manuscript: 22 January 1891. A facsimile of the four manuscript pages of this composition can be seen on this page of Nicolas Fogwall's Satie website. Composed tonally in D minor even though its key signature is empty, the piece features a bass line centred on its minor key, sounding D, A, D, F, A, D, F, D, A, F, D, A, D. The bass part then transposes into a C minor chord I ostinato, following the pattern C, G, C, E, G, C, E, C, G, E, C, G, C. Section B, usually considered a very inspired section, uses semiquavers to contrast the minor melody of Section A. =Gnossienne No. 5= Mod√©r√© (French for Moderato). Dated 8 July 1889, this was probably Satie's first composition after the 1888 Gymnop√©dies: in any case it predates all other known Gnossiennes (including the three published in 1893). The work is somewhat uncharacteristic of the other Gnossiennes not only in its upbeat style, rhythms and less exotic chordal structures but also in its use of time signatures and bar divisions. =Gnossienne No. 6= (\\"with conviction and with a rigorous sadness\\"). Composed nearly 8 years after the first, in January 1897. = ‚Äì = The (\\"The son of the stars\\") incidental music (composed 1891) contains a Gnossienne in the first act. For this one the naming as \\"Gnossienne\\" is definitely by Satie (as apparent from the correspondence with his publisher). As a result of that, this music is sometimes known as the 7th Gnossienne. That part of the music was re-used as (\\"A way to begin\\"), the first of the seven movements of the Trois morceaux en forme de poire (\\"Three pieces in the shape of a pear\\").

A right-handed batsman and right-arm bowler of either medium-pace or off-spin, he was instrumental in Lancashire County Cricket Club's successes in the 1990s, and is now the county's cricket manager. He showed early promise as an all-round sportsman, excelling in both cricket and football, and achieving good standards in golf and basketball. He demonstrated that good hand, ball and eye co-ordination can be applied to many sports, and thus it is no surprise that he was able to make his living through sport. Watkinson attended Westhoughton County Primary School, and Rivington and Blackrod High School. During this time he was a regular player at Westhoughton Cricket Club in the Bolton Cricket League, where he drew attention from Teddy Gerrard, a coach at the club. He played in local matches for the Astley Region Southern Explorers where his bowling skills developed. Under the expert tuition of coach Wayne Kerr, Watkinson developed an accurate style of bowling inswingers and leg breaks, using pitch rather than pace to take wickets. From these beginnings, and following cricketing predecessors from the club (four of the Tyldesley family made the ground staff at Old Trafford, with Dick Tyldesley reaching international level with England) Watkinson emulated the local heroes, playing for Lancashire and England. He was captain of the Lancashire side from 1992 to 1997. He has taken the position of Club Manager for Lancashire, and no longer plays professional cricket. In October 2014 Watkinson announced that he was going to resign from his role as Director of Lancashire following a disappointing season, which saw the club relegated for the second time in Two Years from the top flight of County Championship Cricket, this for Watkinson ends an association with his home county club that he has been with since 1982. In 2018, Watkinson became Director of Sports at The Manchester Grammar School. Watkinson currently lives with his family in Edgeworth, where he donated a bench to the locals.

Karposh, the rebellion leader, was born in Ottoman Vardar Macedonia, probably in the village of Vojnica in today's ƒåa≈°ka Municipality, under the name Peter. At a very young age he escaped to Wallachia where he worked as a miner but moved later to the Rhodope Mountains, where he settled in the town of Dospat in Ottoman Bulgaria. He became a notorious hajduk. After the army of the Holy Roman Empire advanced into the Ottoman Balkans, Karposh moved to the area of Znepole, on today's the Bulgarian‚ÄìSerbian border, and began to organise anti-Ottoman resistance detachments here.Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 114. Prelude In 1683, the Holy League of Austria, Poland, Venice, and (later) Russia was formed to oppose the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire suffered defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and was forced to withdraw rapidly from Central Europe. The defeat and the chaotic situation within the Ottoman Empire created widespread social disruption in the Central Balkans, particularly in the regions of √úsk√ºp (Skopje) and Ni≈ü (Ni≈°), where Karposh's rebellion originated.Mihailo Apostolski, Istorija na makedonskiot narod, Institut za nacionalna istorija, Skopje, Macedonia, 1969 p. 279 On 25 October 1689, the Austrian branch of the Holy League, led by General Piccolomini, reached the Plain of √úsk√ºp and were met with rejoicing by the inhabitants of the villages there. The same day, Piccolomini began a withdrawal of his forces, and on 26 October, set fire to the city. Skopje burned for two whole days, through 26 and 27 October. Most of the city of Skopje was destroyed in the fire. Some accounts of these events state that Piccolomini razed Skopje due to an inability of his forces to occupy and govern a city so far from his headquarters, while other accounts state that it was perpetrated to prevent the spread of infectious disease. The uprising In October 1689, an uprising broke out in the region between K√∂stendil (Kyustendil), ≈ûehirk√∂y (Pirot), and √úsk√ºp (Skopje). According to the Turkish historian Silahdar Findikli Mehmed Aga, its leader Karposh was initially a voivoda or haiduks in the vicinity of Dospat, in present-day Bulgaria. After in the Summer of 1689 hoping for help from the Austrian troops, haiduks, and voynuks led by Strahil vojvoda, rose in arms in the area of Northern Thrace between Filibe (Plovdiv) and Pazarcƒ±k (Pazardzhik),War and Society in East Central Europe: East Central European Society and War in the Pre-Revolutionary Eighteenth Century, B√©la K. Kir√°ly, Gunther Erich Rothenberg, Brooklyn College Press, 1982, pp. 319-320. the Turks named him chief of Christian Auxiliary forces in the area between Sofya (Sofia), K√∂pr√ºl√º (Veles), Doyran (Dojran), K√∂stendil (Kjustendil) and Nevrokop to resist against Strahil's rebels. However, he switched sides and attacked and captured Eƒüri Palanka (Kriva Palanka), an Ottoman stronghold, which he made centre of his resistance. After securing Eƒüri Palanka, the rebels built and secured a new stronghold near Kumanova (Kumanovo). It is unclear whether the Austrians assisted the rebels. According to contemporary Ottoman chronicles and local legends, Karposh was known as the \\"King of Kumanovo\\", a title conferred upon him by Emperor Leopold I who sent him a beautiful busby as a gift and a sign of recognition.Habsburgs and Ottomans between Vienna and Belgrade (1683-1739) Ivan PƒÉrvev p. 92 Suppression Order for killing Karposh The situation for the rebels did not turn out well due to military and political reversals which played a decisive role in the fate of the uprising. The first step taken by the Turkish Ottoman authorities in the region was to put down the rebellion and drive the Austrian army out of Ottoman territory. To do that the Ottomans employed the services of the Crimean Khan Selim I Giray. The council of war which met in Sofia on 14 November 1689 decided to attack the rebels through Kyustendil. But before they could do that they had to secure Kriva Palanka. Upon finding that they were about to be attacked, the rebels set fire to Kriva Palanka and concentrated their forces in the new fortress of Kumanovo. They just managed to make some preparations when the Ottoman and Tatar detachments arrived. The rebels were quickly overwhelmed by the numerically superior Ottoman force. A large number of rebels, including Karposh, were captured at the outset. This became known as the Second Battle of Kumanovo.Rozita Dimova, Ethno-Baroque: Materiality, Aesthetics and Conflict in Modern-Day Macedonia, Berghahn Books, 2013, , p. 97.Œë. Œï.

When the battle was over, all rebels who resisted were slaughtered. Karposh and the others were taken prisoner. After subduing Kumanovo, the Ottomans left for Skopje where they executed Karposh and the others. It is believed that Karposh died on the historic Stone bridge in Skopje Ottoman Macedonia. Aftermath For the rebels who survived the battles there was no salvation from the Ottoman backlash except to leave the Balkans. Many fled north beyond the Sava and Danube Rivers.

It opened in 1992 on the banks of the Tennessee River in downtown Chattanooga, with a major expansion added in 2005. The aquarium, which has been accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) since 1993, is home to more than 12,000 animals representing almost 800 species. More than 20 million people have visited the facility, with the twenty-millionth visitor arriving in March 2013. It is consistently recognized as one of the country's top public aquariums.  Exhibits  The Tennessee Aquarium's exhibits are housed in two structures, the original River Journey building which opened in 1992 and the neighboring Ocean Journey expansion, which opened in 2005. = River Journey = Brook trout, brown trout and rainbow trout on exhibit in River Journey The River Journey facility is a 130,000 square foot structure equivalent in height to a twelve-story building. It contains a total of , and was the largest freshwater aquarium in the world when it opened. It is organized around the theme of the Story of the River, following the path of a raindrop from high in the Appalachian Mountains to the Gulf of Mexico. Approximately two-thirds of the facility's display follows this theme, with the rest devoted to smaller aquatic exhibits hosting organisms from around the world. Major exhibits in River Journey include: * The Appalachian Cove Forest featuring River Otter Falls, which opened in 2014 and replaced a smaller exhibit of North American river otters. It also displays free-flying North American song birds, native fish species including shiners, daces, darters, redhorse, hog suckers and trout, and an artificial waterfall falling into a mountain sink.North American Native Fish Association:The Tennessee Aquarium: A Must-See for Native Fish Enthusiasts; retrieved March 21, 2014 * Delta Country, which exhibits species from the Mississippi River delta. Its centerpiece is Alligator Bayou, which opened in 2015 and features a group of young American alligators and a pair of alligator snapping turtles. Potbelly seahorses on exhibit in River Journey * Rivers of the World, which includes several small to medium-large aquaria that represent the Amazon River, Congo (Zaire) River, Fly River and others. This gallery is also home to the aquarium's electric eel, Miguel Wattson, which \\"communicates\\" with the public through a Twitter account to which pre-programmed tweets are posted when it emits electricity. In December 2019 the eel's electricity was also used to power the lights on a Christmas tree. * The Tennessee River gallery, which exhibits species found in the Tennessee River valley. Its centerpiece is the Nickajack Lake tank featuring species which live in the intensively managed Tennessee River itself, including the American paddlefish and channel catfish. * River Giants, which contains giant freshwater fish from around the world, such as alligator gar, arapaima, giant pangasius, redtail catfish and giant freshwater stingray.Tennessee Aquarium: River Giants. Retrieved 21 March 2014 River Journey also displays turtles, seahorses, frogs and other aquatic and marine life. = Ocean Journey = Ocean Journey, a 60,000 square foot structure equivalent in height to a ten-story building, opened in 2005 and contains a total of . It ostensibly follows the theme of the River Journey by following the river into the Gulf of Mexico. This facility includes hyacinth macaws, a touch tank of small sharks and rays, and a butterfly garden with free-flying South American species. Major exhibits in Ocean Journey include: Sea nettle on exhibit in Ocean Journey. * The Secret Reef, the largest tank in Ocean Journey (and the Tennessee Aquarium), containing . It depicts the environment of the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico and can be viewed from three levels including the Undersea Cavern, an underwater walk-through feature. The species exhibited in the Secret Reef include sand tiger sharks, bonnethead sharks and green sea turtles, one of which, Oscar, is a rescue animal missing much of its rear flippers due to injuries from a boat and a predator. * The Boneless Beauties and Jellies: Living Art galleries, which exhibit invertebrates including corals, jellyfish, cuttlefish, giant Pacific octopuses, and Japanese spider crabs. Jellies: Living Art is a collaboration with the nearby Hunter Museum of American Art and includes rotating exhibits of art glass alongside the jellyfish. * Penguins' Rock, which displays macaroni penguins and gentoo penguins onshore and swimming in a tank. = Offsite activities = In addition to its exhibit halls, the Tennessee Aquarium includes two public offsite facilities. The River Gorge Explorer, a 65-foot catamaran tour boat, offers daily tours of the nearby Tennessee River Gorge and other sites along the Tennessee River, boarding from the public pier in Ross's Landing Park adjacent to the aquarium. The aquarium also operates an IMAX 3D theater.  History  = Planning and development = The Tennessee Aquarium was designed to serve as a cornerstone for redevelopment in downtown Chattanooga by reconnecting the city with the Tennessee River. At the beginning of the 1980s the Chattanooga-based Lyndhurst Foundation funded a series of initiatives to promote revitalization in the city, which was suffering from the impacts of deindustrialization and population decline. In 1981 the University of Tennessee's urban design program, with funding from Lyndhurst, established the Urban Design Studio in Chattanooga as an opportunity for its students to gain real-world experience in urban planning. This led to the first public mention of an aquarium project, in a 1982 student exhibit of what they described as an \\"urban design structure\\" for downtown Chattanooga and the adjacent riverfront. Another Lyndhurst-funded venture, the Moccasin Bend Task Force, was impaneled in 1982 by the City of Chattanooga and Hamilton County to study options for the Moccasin Bend archaeological site immediately north of the Tennessee River, but expanded its scope to cover the city's entire 22-mile riverfront. Its Tennessee Riverpark Master Plan, finalized in 1985, also included a recommendation for a riverfront aquarium. The aquarium plan was additionally endorsed by Vision 2000, a public visioning process carried out in 1984 under the auspices of the nonprofit Chattanooga Venture, as one of forty goals set out for the city to pursue. Development of the aquarium and the adjoining Ross's Landing Park, part of the Tennessee Riverpark project, was funded by a combination of nonprofit, public, and private individual supporters. The site selected for the aquarium was a group of abandoned warehouses at the foot of Chattanooga's Broad Street, which was acquired for $4.5 million by the RiverCity Company, a nonprofit development agency created in 1986 to implement the Tennessee Riverpark Master Plan, and later deeded to the aquarium. The park received public funds, but the $45 million needed to construct the aquarium was raised privately. John T. Lupton, the chairman of the Lyndhurst Foundation, contributed $10 million from the foundation and $11 million of his personal funds to the project, as well as raising funds from other donors. River Journey, the first Tennessee Aquarium building The aquarium building was designed by Cambridge Seven Associates, which had previously designed the National Aquarium in Baltimore and the New England Aquarium in Boston. The decision to focus on freshwater environments was made during the planning process, as participants reasoned that it would be difficult to raise money for an aquarium offering conventional salt-water exhibits and that most people would be unlikely to travel to Chattanooga in order to visit one. The resulting structure is organized vertically, following the theme of water traveling through the Tennessee River system from the mountains to the sea. The two living forests, representing terrestrial habitats in Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, are located at the top of the building and lit by skylights, while underwater habitats are viewed or accessed from the building's dimly lit, multi-story central \\"canyon.\\" The building's exterior reinforces the focus of the exhibits with a series of 53 bas-relief depictions of the history of the Tennessee River valley set into the walls. In the surrounding plaza of Ross's Landing Park, variegated bands of plantings and paving represent a chronology of Chattanooga, with a stream flowing through the park to guide visitors through its history from its beginnings as a Cherokee settlement during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, facing towards the river, to the present, facing towards downtown Chattanooga. Construction began in November 1988, and the aquarium opened to the public on May 1, 1992. Some observers were skeptical of the project, with local detractors describing it in terms like \\"Jack Lupton's fish tank\\" and some analysts questioning whether Chattanooga had fallen victim to a fad for public aquariums and overestimated the potential economic impact. However, it was successful from the beginning. The aquarium met its first-year goal of 650,000 visitors by the end of August 1992, and by the end of May 1993 more than 1.5 million people had visited. = Expansion = During the aquarium's early years, planners considered ways in which it could be used as a foundation for additional public projects with aquatic themes. In 1988 it was suggested that it could become the anchor of a complex that would also include a sports fishing trade center, potentially making Chattanooga the sports fishing capital of America. In 1993 SITE, one of the firms which had designed Ross's Landing Park, was asked by regional development authorities to design a center for exploration of other aspects of aquatic science and activity; its proposal, the \\"Aquatorium,\\" included a museum, a conference center, and a spa. Neither of these ideas was developed. The Tennessee Aquarium IMAX theater adjacent to Ross's Landing Park. In 1995 the aquarium broke ground on a $14 million IMAX center on land adjacent to Ross's Landing Park, containing an educational facility and offices as well as the IMAX theater. This expansion opened in 1996. During its first decade the aquarium also focused on improving and refining its initial designs for the permanent exhibits, and presented two temporary exhibitions, \\"Jellies: Phantoms of the Deep\\" in 1998 and \\"VENOM: Striking Beauties\\" in 2000. In 2002 Chattanooga undertook a new public planning process, the 21st Century Waterfront, to continue the reorientation towards the river that had begun with the Tennessee Riverpark Master Plan. An expansion for the aquarium was part of the resulting blueprint for $120 million in improvements to both sides of the downtown riverfront. Although the plan for Ocean Journey was announced a month after the developers of what would become the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, two hours away from Chattanooga, announced their choice of a building site, Tennessee Aquarium officials insisted that their own plans were not a response to this potential competition and that the addition of saltwater exhibits simply reflected visitor requests. However, by the early 2000s analysts were warning of an \\"aquarium glut\\" in the United States, after the number of accredited public aquariums in the country grew from 26 to 40 between 1993 and 2003 while the overall number of aquarium visitors rose by only 23% during a similar time frame. Ocean Journey The aquarium raised the $30 million needed for its expansion through a combination of a $10 million bond issue and $20 million raised as part of the 21st Century Waterfront campaign, which included private donations, federal and state funds, and the proceeds of a hotel/parking tax. To design the new building and exhibits, the aquarium turned to the firm of Chermayeff, Sollogub and Poole, whose principal Peter Chermayeff designed River Journey as part of Cambridge Seven Associates. While the building's diverse exhibits departed from the Tennessee River theme of River Journey, its structure included a multi-story glass gallery designed to maintain visitors' connection to the river. Work began on the expansion on April 3, 2003, and Ocean Journey opened on April 29, 2005. The 21st Century Waterfront incorporated the new building with River Journey and Ross's Landing Park, continuing the theme of Chattanooga's early history by locating The Passage, an interactive public art installation marking the site of the beginning of the Trail of Tears in Chattanooga, alongside it. = Economic and community impact = The Tennessee Aquarium was the first element of Chattanooga's downtown revitalization plans to begin operation, preceding hotels, restaurants and entertainment venues. Community leaders credit it with beginning to improve residents' perceptions of the downtown and riverfront districts, as well as attracting tourist traffic. Initial estimates of the aquarium's economic impact predicted $750 million in direct and indirect contributions to the local economy; by 2012, more than $2 billion in additional investments had been made in Chattanooga's downtown, and the aquarium was widely acknowledged as the linchpin of this redevelopment process. A 2014 study done for the aquarium by the University of Tennessee Center for Sustainable Business and Development concluded that its annual economic impact is an estimated $101.3 million and over 1000 jobs overall. During the initial planning process of the 1980s, the aquarium was also presented as a means by which Chattanooga could overcome the difficulties of its recent past. Planners hoped that as a project free of historic ties, the aquarium would be embraced by all parts of a community traditionally divided by race and by economic and social class. In the 1990s, development of a \\"world-class\\" aquarium was considered a sign of hope for the economically- depressed city and evidence of its ability to come together to create civic improvements. As downtown Chattanooga continues to develop, the city has emerged as an example of successful revitalization in older American urban areas; the aquarium is recognized as an example of the \\"Chattanooga Way,\\" which relies on cooperation among the city, foundations and private enterprise, plus a high degree of public involvement, to complete significant projects in the community despite limited government resources. Viewed as part of Chattanooga's revitalization, however, its impact is disputed. Chattanooga remains a heavily segregated city, and some argue that the \\"placemaking\\" to which the aquarium contributes has exacerbated this problem.  Conservation and research  Scientific research and conservation activities have been an integral part of the aquarium's work since it opened in 1992. Its research department was established in 1994. In addition, the aquarium's parent Tennessee Aquarium Corporation and board of trustees oversee a separate conservation initiative, the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute. = Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute = In 1996 the aquarium founded a research and conservation arm, now known as the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute (TNACI). Its mission is the protection of aquatic species and habitats in the southeastern United States. The TNACI was founded as the Southeastern Aquatic Research Institute (SARI), and was initially a joint venture between the Tennessee Aquarium, the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and the Tennessee River Gorge Trust. In 2002 it became the Tennessee Aquarium Research Institute (TNARI), and in 2011 was renamed as the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute to emphasize its conservation mission. Between 1999 and 2011 the institute was housed at a site in Cohutta, Georgia. Since then, its workspace has been divided between its propagation facility in Cohutta, and other activities based at the aquarium in Chattanooga and its animal care facility. In October 2015 the TNACI announced that it will be building a new home, a facility which Institute director Anna George described as a \\"freshwater field station\\" for research and education, on the campus of Baylor School on the north shore of the Tennessee River. The $4.5 million project is expected to be completed in the fall of 2016. Lake sturgeon hatchlings awaiting release into the Tennessee River system by members of the Tennessee River Lake Sturgeon Working Group. The TNACI is focused on the restoration of freshwater ecosystems, including the study of water quality and the propagation and reintroduction of native aquatic species to southeastern waterways, and works in partnership with other conservation groups and agencies in Georgia and Tennessee. Since 2000, the TNACI has participated in the Tennessee River Lake Sturgeon Working Group, a program to restore the lake sturgeon to the Tennessee River Basin. In order to reestablish a self- sustaining population of sturgeon, which were declared extinct in the Tennessee River in 1961, the TNACI collects eggs from populations in the Great Lakes, hatches them in Georgia, and raises them at the Tennessee Aquarium until they are large enough to be released into the river. More than 180,000 sturgeon have been released as of October 2015, and sightings have been reported along the length of the Tennessee River between Knoxville, Tennessee, and Kentucky Lake. Some fish have been implanted with tracking devices, providing an additional means of monitoring the population; the trackers include acoustical devices detectable by receivers, including a mobile receiver aboard the River Gorge Explorer. The program is projected to continue until the oldest released fish have reached breeding age, an estimated 20 years in all. The TNACI participates in the Barrens Topminnow Working Group, which works with property owners in the Barrens Plateau region of central Tennessee to restore 15 historic populations of this fish with the goal of preventing it from becoming an endangered species. In 2013 the TNACI began a program to reintroduce and monitor captive-raised southern Appalachian brook trout, which have suffered from the effects of climate change and competition from introduced species, in suitable rivers and streams. Other reintroduction efforts have included the restoration of eighteen species of native southeastern snails and mussels, including the Alabama moccasinshell mussel and the interrupted rocksnail, and the Conasauga logperch. The institute also participates in habitat restoration projects, including the restoration of the privately owned Colvard Spring near Dalton, Georgia which provides habitat for the endangered coldwater darter. Other TNACI projects include conservation genetics research on fish species, including the blue shiner, flame chub, laurel dace, and Conasauga logperch, and the development of the Freshwater Information Network (FIN), a database of current and historic locality information for 62 southeastern fish species in peril. In April 2016 the institute, working with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and Southeast Missouri State University, began an assessment of the alligator snapping turtle population in Tennessee. = Turtle conservation = The aquarium's collection of turtles and tortoises includes more than 500 individuals, representing more than 75 species. In 1993 Tennessee Aquarium researchers partnered with researchers from the University of Tennessee at Martin to undertake a three-year study of turtle populations in Reelfoot Lake, the first scientific assessment of turtles in that habitat. Its efforts to reintroduce native southeastern species include work with the yellow-blotched map turtle, which the aquarium has worked to restore to its natural habitat in the Pascagoula River system, and the bog turtle. The aquarium has participated in the Bog Turtle Headstart program, part of the Georgia Mountain Bog Enhancement Project, through captive breeding of the turtles. The aquarium is working to conserve endangered Asian turtle species through captive breeding. Since 2011, its scientists have coordinated species survival plans for four turtle species, the keeled box turtle, the endangered spiny turtle, the endangered four-eyed turtle, and the critically endangered Arakan forest turtle. It is the only accredited zoo or aquarium in the United States to hatch another critically endangered southeast Asian species, the Beale's eyed turtle. The aquarium's collection of these turtles, which reached 20 individuals by 2015, has grown large enough to provide founding individuals for populations at other institutions, beginning with the Knoxville Zoo. = Breeding and propagation = In addition to its success in turtle breeding, the Tennessee Aquarium has successfully propagated a range of other species. Aquarists have hatched epaulette sharks and coral catsharks, as well as seahorses, jellyfish, stingrays and cuttlefish. The aquarium has sent creatures born or hatched on site to other AZA-accredited institutions. Its gentoo and macaroni penguins began to breed in 2007, with four females born in 2015. In 2014 11 of the penguins born at the aquarium, nine gentoo and two macaroni, were sent to SeaWorld in San Diego, California as part of the breeding loan agreement which initially brought penguins to the aquarium. In 2014 red piranhas hatched at the aquarium were sent to the Wonders of Wildlife aquarium and museum in Springfield, Missouri. = Conservation activities on display = The Barrens Topminnow Lab in River Journey, a display that includes facilities for raising young topminnows as well as a video explaining the project. While much of the aquarium's and the TNACI's conservation work takes place away from public view, River Journey includes exhibits that highlight some of the species involved, including the \\"Barrens Topminnow Lab\\" display, which allows visitors to observe the topminnows as they are reared in captivity for reintroduction to the wild, a sturgeon touch tank, and the \\"Turtles: Nature's Living Sculptures\\" gallery, which includes hatchlings of endangered species born at the aquarium.  Education and outreach  The Tennessee Aquarium and TNACI operate extensive education and outreach programs serving children, youth and adults. Since 2001, the Tennessee Aquarium has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as a special-purpose school. It is the only such school based in an aquarium. In 2009, the Tennessee Aquarium received the National Medal for Museum and Library Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, an award which recognizes \\"extraordinary and innovative approaches to public service, exceeding the expected levels of community outreach.\\" The aquarium provides educational programming, aligned to state curriculum standards, to students who visit the campus on field trips and through an outreach program available to schools and communities within 150 miles of its location. Its programs include free admission to the facility for more than 30,000 students annually. During 2015, in partnership with Tennessee Tech University, Tennessee Aquarium and TNACI educators developed a virtual reality program using the Oculus Rift system, which simulates the experience of snorkeling in a river for students who visit the aquarium and allows them to experience the impact of water pollution firsthand. The aquarium also offers a range of camps, workshops and other programming for children and teens, and internships and collaboration opportunities for college students. It has established an ongoing relationship with the Calvin Donaldson Environmental Science Academy, a Title 1 magnet elementary school located in the South Chattanooga neighborhood, offering the students a range of activities including field trips to the aquarium, field study programs, and an overnight camp-out experience. The TNACI includes school groups in the release of lake sturgeon and other species into local rivers, and since 2012 it has offered a week-long summer program, CLAW (Conservation Leadership in Action Week) Camp, for high school students. The institute also offers internships for college students and graduates, and works with graduate students. In 2014, over 300 students studied with the TNACI. Aquarium outreach programs include the community as a whole. A notable example is the Serve & Protect program, which educates the public about sustainable seafood. It was established in 2011 in partnership with chef and television personality Alton Brown, an advocate of sustainable fisheries, who visited Chattanooga for events in 2011 and 2012. Serve & Protect activities, including cooking demonstrations, cook-offs and dinners, are designed to encourage visitors and participants to consume sustainable seafood such as catfish, squid, Arctic char and summer flounder, as a way of removing pressure from threatened fisheries. The aquarium also participates in the AZA's SAFE (Saving Animals From Extinction) program, focusing on shark conservation.

The Blandair Foundation estate of Mrs. Smith was purchased by Howard County, Maryland in the late 1990s and is in the process of being developed as a regional park. History In 1689, 1087 acres on Elk Ridge, in what was then colonial Maryland's Anne Arundel County, was surveyed for Edward Talbott. Known as \\"Talbott's Resolution Manor\\", Talbott bequeathed the property to his children, John and Elizabeth, who each received half of the property after his death in 1689. The land was patented to John and Elizabeth Talbott in 1714, and by 1716 they had quickly sold off 800 acres of the property. By 1753, four different owners were in possession of the original plot: William Hall (500 acres), Nicholas Gassaway (300 acres), Edward Dorsey (200 acres), and Rachel Norwood (87 acres). In 1804, John Crompton Weems purchased a portion named \\"La Grange\\", which he eventually sold to his daughter-in-law, Martha P. Weems. Between 1828 and 1845, Theodorick Bland purchased the farm from the Weems family and under his ownership, the property became known as \\"Blandair\\". Sarah Bland Mayo inherited the property upon her father's death and eventually gave the property to her daughter, Sarah Mayo Gaither, as a wedding present in 1857. Bland's descendants owned the property until the Gaithers sold the property in 1867. Another series of owners held the land until it was sold to Baltimore developer Henry E. Smith and his wife, Lillie, in 1937. After Lillie Smith died in 1979, Blandair was inherited by her daughter, Elizabeth, who resided on the property until her death in 1997. In 1997 or August 1998, Blandair was purchased from the Smith family by Howard County, Maryland using State Rural Legacy funds. Legal challenges delayed planning efforts, but the courts eventually affirmed Howard County's ownership of the property. In 2010 initial construction began on a regional park. The phase I program is part of a series of Howard County projects purchasing historical preservation estates and converting them into a complex of income producing sports fields and facilities such as Troy Hill, and the James and Anne Robinson Nature Center. In 2014, the fields at Blandair were named after Frank S. Turner who helped secure initial open space funding for the $50 million project. Structures Blandair Slave Quarters The estate was documented by the National Park Service's Historic American Buildings Survey in 2003. The main house, known as Blandair Mansion, was built by Bland's descendants in the mid-nineteenth century. As of 2011, the mansion is being restored by the Howard County Department of Recreation and Parks with assistance from the NPS's Historic Preservation Training Center and is slated to become the \\"historical centerpiece\\" of Blandair Regional Park. Built around 1845, a small slave quarter stands next to the main dwelling.  Legal battles  Blandair Barn The lawsuit, Blandair Foundation, Inc. et al. v Jane P. Nes et al., against the title of Blandair Farm and the personal estate of Elizabeth C. Smith was filed on June 29, 1998 in the Circuit Court for Howard County, Maryland. The legal theory behind the suit was that of contract law: Elizabeth C. Smith had promised Byron C. Hall, Jr. that she would form the Blandair Foundation to preserve Blandair Farm, convey the title of Blandair Farm and her entire personal estate to the Blandair Foundation, and to appoint Mr. Hall as a trustee of the Blandair Foundation. In return, Mr. Hall accepted appointment as a trustee of the Blandair Foundation and promised Miss Smith that he would faithfully carry out her wishes for the preservation of Blandair Farm. This voluntary exchange of promises constituted a contract that was broken inadvertently by Miss Smith when she died. The plaintiffs sought specific performance of that contract. The plaintiffs had two hurdles to overcome: the statute of limitations regarding suits against an estate and the statute of frauds regarding the title of Blandair Farm. They argued that the nature of the suit did not fit the accepted criteria of claims against an estate and that partial performance of the contract met the requirements of the statute of frauds. Hearings were held on November 13, 1998, December 17, 1998, and December 7, 1999. The court ruled against the plaintiffs on all counts, with the final opinion issued on June 23, 2000. The plaintiffs decided to appeal the rulings to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. In their briefs, the appellants alleged that the court had erred 1) by misinterpreting Miss Smith's promise as one to make a gift to a charity rather than as one to create a trust, 2) by misapplying standards to judge partial performance of a contract, and 3) by ignoring the distinction between a claim to part of an estate that could have been enforced before Miss Smith's death and a claim to the entirety of an estate that only could have been enforced after her death. A hearing was held before a panel of the Court of Special Appeals on March 5, 2001. On July 31, 2001, the court issued its opinion, rejecting the appeal. The Appellants filed a petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the Court of Appeals (this is the process in Maryland to obtain a discretionary appeal with that court). On October 12, 2001, the court issued an Order denying the petition.

In these places, the name isle√±o (Spanish for 'islander') was applied to the Canary Islanders to distinguish them from Spanish mainlanders known as \\"peninsulars\\" (). Formerly used for the general category of people, it now refers to the specific cultural identity of Canary Islanders or their descendants throughout Latin America and in Louisiana, where they are still called isle√±os. Another name for Canary Islander in English is \\"Canarian.\\" In Spanish, an alternative is canario or isle√±o canario. The term isle√±o is still used in Latin America, at least in those countries which had large Canarian populations, to distinguish a Canary Islander from a peninsular (continental Spaniard). By the early 19th century there were more people of Canarian extraction in the Americas than in the Canary Islands themselves, and the number of descendants of those first immigrants is exponentially larger than the number who originally migrated. The Americas were the destination of most Canarian immigrants, from their discovery by Europeans in the 15th century until the 20th century, when substantial numbers went to the Spanish colonies of Ifni, Western Sahara and Equatorial Guinea in Africa during the first half of the century. Beginning in the 1970s, they began to emigrate to other European countries, although emigration to the Americas did not end until the early 1980s. The cultures of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Uruguay partially have all been influenced by Canarian culture, as have the dialects of Spanish spoken in all but Uruguay. Although almost all descendants of Canary Islanders who emigrated to the Americas from the 16th to the 20th century are incorporated socially and culturally within the larger populations, there remain a few communities that have preserved at least some of their ancestors' Canarian culture, as in Louisiana, San Antonio in Texas, Hatillo, Puerto Rico, San Carlos de Tenerife (now a neighborhood of Santo Domingo) in the Dominican Republic and San Borond√≥n in Peru.  General history  Isle√±o settlements in Louisiana \\"Spanish\\" trapper and sons, Delacroix Island, 1941 The Canary Islander emigration to the Americas began as early as 1492, with the first voyage of Columbus, and did not end until the early 1980s. The Spanish conquest of the Canary Islands (probably first visited by the Phoenicians and rediscovered by Europeans in the 14th century) had only recently occurred (1402‚Äì1496), when Columbus made a stopover in the Canary Islands for supplies in 1501. Also in 1501 (possibly 1502), Nicol√°s de Ovando left the Canary Islands with a group of people heading to the island of Hispaniola. In the early 16th century, some Guanches from the Canary Islands were exported as slaves to Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo, a practice that continued as late as 1534. In the first half of the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors, some of whom settled permanently in the Americas themselves, organized several groups of people chosen in the Canary Islands to colonize parts of Latin America including Mexico, Buenos Aires, Peru, New Granada and La Florida. There followed other groups who settled in Santo Domingo and Cuba in the second half of 16th century. In 1611, about 10 Canarian families were sent to Santiago del Prado, Cuba, and by the Royal Decree of May 6, 1663, 800 Canarian families were sent to settle in Santo Domingo; it is assumed this was to avert the danger that the French might seize it, since they already had occupied what is now Haiti. In 1678, the Spanish crown enacted the so-called Tributo de Sangre (Blood Tribute); this was a Spanish law stipulating that for every thousand tons of cargo shipped from Spanish America to Spain, 50 Canarian families would be sent to the Americas to populate regions having low populations of Peninsulares, or Spanish-born Spaniards. Consequently, during the late 17th and 18th century, hundreds of Canarian families moved to Venezuela, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, with others going to places like Uruguay, Mexico, Argentina or the south of the present United States. These families were sent to populate various parts of Latin America. The Tributo de Sangre was finally abolished in 1764. Despite that, many Canarians continued to migrate to the Americas to escape grinding poverty at home. After the liberation of the Latin American countries from Spanish rule (1811‚Äì1825), Spain retained only Cuba and Puerto Rico as colonies in the Americas. It abolished slavery in those colonies, and encouraged Canarian emigration. Most Canarian immigrants then emigrated to the two islands in the Caribbean, where their labor was exploited and they were paid very little. There were, however, also thousands of Canarians who emigrated to other countries including Venezuela, Uruguay and Argentina. After the annexation of Cuba and Puerto Rico to the United States and the prohibition of Canarian emigration to Puerto Rico in 1898, emigration was directed primarily to Cuba, with certain flows to other countries (especially Argentina and Uruguay). After 1936, most Canarian immigrants went to Cuba and Venezuela until 1948, when an most of the islanders began emigrating to Venezuela. Since the 1970s Canarian emigration has decreased and from the early 1980s, with the improvement of the Canary Islands' economy (and Spain's in general, until the economic crisis of 2008), Canarian emigration has diminished.  Reasons for emigration  After a century and a half of growth, the economy of the Canary Islands was in crisis. The diminished output of vidue√±o canario (an internationally traded white table wine) after the 1640 emancipation from Spanish rule of Portugal, whose colonies were its preferred market, put thousands of Canarians out of work, causing many of them to emigrate to the Americas with their families. There was discussion in governmental circles of the islands being overpopulated, and the Spanish crown decided to institute the \\"El Tributo de Sangre (the tribute of blood). For each ton of cargo that a Spanish colony in the Americas sent to Spain, five Canarian families would be sent there. The number of families actually sent, however, usually exceeded ten. The occupation of Jamaica by the English and of the western half of Santo Domingo and the Guianas by the French made the Spanish Crown consider want to avoid the occupation of part of Venezuela and the Greater Antilles. Commerce in cochineal dye expanded in the Canary Islands during the 19th century well into the 1880s, when trade in this product plummeted, which, together with the coffee boom and the war crisis in Cuba, depressed the economy. It also spurred Canarian emigration to the Americas. After 1893, Canarians continued to emigrate to Venezuela to escape Spanish military service. During the Ten Years' War (1868‚Äì1878) in Cuba, Cuban separatists made a distinction between Canary Islander immigrants and those from peninsular Spain, leading them to promote Canarian immigration to Cuba. The usual form of administration to manage the emigration from the islands prevailed, with corruption and fraud governing the actions of the Canarian ruling classes. In the 20th century poverty, the Spanish Civil War, and the actions of Francoist Spain also drove Canarian emigration to the Americas.La emigracion canaria. For the reasons already mentioned, there were specific problems on some islands that also boosted Canarian emigration. In Lanzarote, from the 16th to the 20th century, the people experienced terrible drought (1626‚Äì1632), epidemics, house and tithe taxes, invasions of locusts, and several volcanic eruptions in 1730, affecting over half the population, causing many of them to migrate, pirate attacks (Lanzarote suffered more pirate invasions than the other islands) and harsh weather conditions. Consequently, many people on Lanzarote migrated to other Canary Islands including (Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura) as well as to the Americas, including Uruguay, Argentina, Cuba, Venezuela and the southern United States.  United States  During the 18th century, the Spanish crown sent several groups of Canary Islanders to their colonies in New Spain. Spain's goal was to colonize certain regions with Spanish settlers, and between 1731 and 1783, several Canarian communities were established in what is now the Southern United States. In 1731, 16 Canarian families arrived in San Antonio, Spanish Texas. Between 1757 and 1759, 154 families were sent to Spanish Florida. Between 1778 and 1783 another 2,100 Canarians arrived in Spanish Louisiana and founded the four communities of Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. Of those settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most successful as the other two were plagued with both disease and flooding. The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. Many Isle√±os fought in the American Revolutionary War and the Battle of the Alamo. After the incorporation of Louisiana and Texas into the United States, they fought in the Civil War and both World Wars. The Isle√±os have been able to preserve some features of their culture except in Florida, where they had made improvements in its agriculture, but most of the Canarian settlers emigrated to Cuba when Florida was ceded to Great Britain in 1763 and still more left when, after being recovered by Spain, Florida was ceded to the United States in 1819. The dialect of Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands during the 18th century was still spoken by older Isle√±os until the 1950s in San Antonio but is still spoken in St. Bernard Parish.  Hispanic Antilles  Louisiana's Isle√±os have shared some aspects of Canarian culture for over 200 years with the Cuban, Puerto Rican and Dominican peoples in those Caribbean countries influenced by earlier waves of settlers from the Canary Islands, who first arrived in the Americas in the late 16th century. = Cuba = Of the Latin American countries, Cuba was most affected by the immigration of Canary Islanders, and their presence influenced the development of the Cuban dialect and accent. Many words in traditional Cuban Spanish can be traced to the dialect spoken in the Canary Islands. Cuban Spanish is very close to Canarian Spanish, as Canarians have been emigrating to Cuba since the 16th century, especially during the 19th and (early) 20th centuries. Through cross-emigration by Canarians and Cubans, many Canarian customs have become Cuban traditions and vice versa. Cuban music has been integrated into Canarian culture as well, including mambo, son, and punto Cubano. Cuban emigration to the Canary Islands has introduced, for example, the dish \\"moros y cristianos\\" (or simply \\"moros\\"), to the cuisine of the Canary Islands; especially on the island of La Palma. Canary Islanders were the driving force in the cigar industry in Cuba, where they were called \\"Vegueros.\\" Many of the big cigar factories in Cuba were owned by Canary Islanders. After the Castro revolution, many Cubans and returning Canarians settled in the Canary Islands, among them cigar factory owners such as the Garcias. Through them the cigar industry made its way to the Canary Islands from Cuba, and it is now well-established there. The island of La Palma has had the most Cuban influence out of the seven islands, and its accent is the closest of the island accents to the Cuban accent. Many of the typical Cuban variations of standard Spanish vocabulary derive from the Canarian lexicon. For example, the word \\"guagua\\" (bus) differs from the standard Spanish autob√∫s; the former originated in the Canaries and is an onomatopoeic word imitative of the sound of a Klaxon horn (wah-wah). The term of endearment socio is from the Canary Islands. An example of Canarian usage for a Spanish word is the verb fajarse (to fight). In standard Spanish the verb would be pelearse, while fajar exists as a non-reflexive verb related to the hemming of a skirt. The Cuban dialect of Spanish shows a substantial influence of the Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands. Many names for food items come from the Canary Islands as well. The Cuban sauce mojo is based on the mojos of the Canary Islands, where the sauce was invented. Canarian ropa vieja was introduced to Cuba through Canarian emigration. Gofio is another Canarian food known to Cubans, along with many others. = Puerto Rico = J√≠baros were of Canarian stock Between 1678 and 1764 the Spanish policy of tributo de sangre stated that for every ton of cargo shipped from the Spanish colonies in the Americas to Spain, five Canarian families were sent to populate the colonies. The number of families sent to the Americas, however, often became ten. The first wave of Canarian emigration seems to have occurred in 1695 when Juan Fern√°ndez Franco de Medina, the new Governor of Puerto Rico, arrived with 20 Canarian families.Emigration to Puerto Rico This was followed by others in 1714, 1720, 1731, and 1797. Between 1720 and 1730, some 176 Canarian families, totaling 882 persons, emigrated to Puerto Rico, more than half of them married couples and their children, and the rest eventually found partners in Puerto Rico. The tributo de sangre ended in 1764, but poverty and overpopulation in the Canary Islands still caused many Canarians to emigrate to Puerto Rico and other parts of Latin America. After the Spanish American colonies won their independence (1811‚Äì1825), most Canarian immigrants went to Cuba and Puerto Rico, the only remaining Spanish possessions in the Americas, where their labor was exploited to replace that of slaves, who had been liberated with the abolishment of slavery. Following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, Canarian immigration to the Americas continued. Successive waves of Canary Island immigration came to Puerto Rico, and entire villages were formed of relocated islanders.www.canaryislandsusa.com Between 1891 and 1895, Canary emigration to Puerto Rico was officially over 600 immigrants; if unrecorded or concealed immigration were taken into account, the number would be much larger.The Spanish of the Canary Islands Canarian emigration to Puerto Rico in the 19th century is estimated at 2,733 people, mostly peasants desiring to farm their own land, who tended to settle in Puerto Rico in families or groups of families related to each other.Las ra√≠ces isle√±as de Mayag√ºez (The Island Roots of Mayag√ºez) by Federico Ced√≥ Alzamora, Official Historian of Mayag√ºez. Whole towns and villages in Puerto Rico were founded by Canarian immigrants, and their lasting influence of Canarian culture can still be heard in the Puerto Rican accent and seen in the cuatro, a small guitar with origins in the Canary Islands. The Canarian Islands have contributed more to the Puerto Rican population than any other Spanish region except Andalusia, and Canary Islanders, along with Andalusians, were the principal Spanish expatriate community there by the 19th century. The Isle√±os contributed substantially to the development of agriculture, as well as the provincial rural character of Puerto Rican society, preserving their ancestral customs, traditions, folk arts, dialect and festivals that remain features of Puerto Rican culture. They tended to settle in areas where other Isle√±os were already living, preferring certain rural districts and towns like Camuy, Hatillo and Barceloneta. They concentrated also in San Juan, Ponce, Lares, San Sebasti√°n, Lajas, Mayag√ºez and Manat√≠. Many settled in small villages where they intermarried with other Puerto Ricans and with the J√≠baro peasants. Most of the Isle√±os arrived on the island married, often with many children, which helped to preserve their customs, traditions, religions, and accent. A group of geneticists from Puerto Rican universities conducted a study of mitochondrial DNA, which is passed through the mother, and found that the present population of Puerto Rico has in its genome a substantial compononent of genes from Guanches, the Canarian aborigines, especially those from the island of Tenerife. In some areas of the island, this Guanche component appears in over 50% of the sampled population, and in the western part, it appears in over 80%. Even today, there are people in these towns who can relate stories from their Canary Island great- grandparents that they remember when they were children. = Dominican Republic = In 1501, Nicol√°s de Ovando left the Canary Islands with a group of Canarians, some of them from Lanzarote, and sailed to Hispaniola island. There was also an influx of Canarian settlers, who arrived on the colony of Santo Domingo (now Dominican Republic) in the second half of the 16th century. Santo Domingo, in the mid-17th century, still had a very small population and suffered economic hardship. The Spanish authorities believed that the French, who had occupied the western part of the island (now Haiti), might also try to take the eastern half of the island, now the Dominican Republic. They asked the Spanish crown to send Canarian families to stop French expansion. By the royal decree of May 6, 1663, under the policy of the tributo de sangre, 800 Canarian families were sent to the island.La emigraci√≥n y su trascendencia en la historia del pueblo canario. There were 97 Canarian families who arrived in 1684 and founded San Carlos de Tenerife (in 1911, it became a neighborhood of the city of Santo Domingo). The Spanish authorities there concentrated resources on agriculture and livestock, and incorporated a municipality and a church dedicated to the city's patroness, Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria (Our Lady of Candelaria). The population increased with the arrival of 39 families in 1700 and another 49 in 1709. Canarian families who arrived that year had to bribe the governor to be permitted to remain there. In the first decades of the 18th century, another group of Canarian emigrated to Santiago de los Caballeros, where they formed a militia made up exclusively of Canarians, and another in Frontera, where the group founded Banica and Hincha in 1691 and 1702, respectively. In the latter two settlements the raising of livestock prospered thanks to the growing trade with Haiti. The lack of financial resources and the War of the Spanish Succession led to a decrease in Canarian immigration to the area. Afterwards, Canarian immigration increase significantly but came to a standstill again between 1742 and 1749 as a result of the war with England. The Canarians settled mainly on the border with Haiti to prevent French territorial expansion of the country, founding San Rafael de Angostura, San Miguel de la Atalaya, the Las Caobas and Dajab√≥n) as well as ports in strategic locations in Monte Cristi Province with the arrival of 46 families between 1735 and 1736, Puerto Plata (1736), Samana (1756) and Sabana de la Mar (1760). The Canarians also founded San Carlos de Tenerife, Ban√≠, Neiba, San Juan de la Maguana and J√°nico.Origen de la poblaci√≥n dominicana. After 1764, the Canarians were sent primarily to the Cibao. The thriving border towns there were abandoned in 1794, when the area become part of Haiti during the Haitian domination (1822‚Äì1844). Isle√±os on the now Haitian side of the border moved to the interior of the island, and some of them, especially of those from Cibao, moved to Cuba, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. The Isle√±os were, for a time, the fastest-growing ethnic group in the Dominican Republic. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the flow of Canarians emigrating to the country slowed to a trickle. Pedro Santana, the first president of the Dominican Republic, rented several Venezuelan ships during the mid-19th century period of border disputes with Haiti to carry Isle√±os to the Dominican Republic, but most of the 2,000 who emigrated returned to Venezuela in 1862, when Jos√© Antonio P√°ez came to power. Many of the Canarians who settled in the Dominican Republic (including Jose Trujillo Monagas, originally from Gran Canaria and the grandfather of the later dictator Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo), settled in the capital and in rural areas, especially in the east. During the first half of the 20th century, some groups of Canarians emigrated to the Dominican Republic, many of them Republican exiles who came during and after the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). 300 Canarians arrived in 1955, when Trujillo encouraged Spanish emigration to his country to raise the white population, but most of them left and went to Venezuela because of the harsh conditions. Some of them remained in Constanza and in El Cibao. Isle√±os contributed to the development of agriculture in the Dominican Republic with their raising of crops like coffee, cocoa and tobacco.  Venezuela  During colonial times and until the end of the Second World War, most European immigrants in Venezuela were Canary Islanders. Their cultural impact was significant, influencing both the development of Castilian Spanish in the country as well as its cuisine and customs. Venezuela has perhaps the largest population of Canarian immigrants, and it is commonly said in the Canary Islands that \\"Venezuela is the eighth island of the Canary Islands.\\" In the 16th century, the German Jorge de la Espira in the Canary Islands recruited 200 men to colonize Venezuela, as did Diego Hern√°ndez de Serpa, governor of New Andalusia Province, who sent another 200 soldiers and 400 slaves from Gran Canaria to Venezuela, where some of these Canarians were among the founders of Cuman√°. Diego de Ordaz, governor of Paria, took about 350 persons, and his successor, Jerome of Ortal, about 80 people, from Tenerife, whether they were native Canarians or just people settled in the islands. In 1681, 54 families from Tenerife were transported to the port of Cuman√°, but this area was so unsafe that a few of them settled in villages already founded or went to the Llanos. The next year, another group of 31 families arrived from Tenerife as well. 25 Canarian families were transported to Guyana in 1717 to found a village, and they then migrated to the Llanos of Venezuela. In 1697, Maracaibo was founded with 40 Canarian families, which was followed in 1700 by another 29 in the town of Los Marqueses. Maracaibo received 25 Canarian families between 1732 and 1738, while in 1764 another 14 families arrived, to which were added another 300 families transported to Venezuela. Many of those who fought in the Venezuelan War of Independence in the first half of the 19th century were Canarians or descendants of Canarians. For example, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var had Canarian ancestors on his mother's side. There were many other notable Venezuelan leaders who were of Canarian descent, such as the precursor of independence Francisco de Miranda, the philosopher Andr√©s Bello and the physician Jos√© Gregorio Hern√°ndez, as well as Jos√© Antonio P√°ez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Vargas, Carlos Soublette, Jos√© Tadeo Monagas, Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, R√≥mulo Betancourt and Rafael Caldera. More than 9,000 Canarians emigrated to Venezuela between 1841 and 1844, and in 1875, more than 5,000 Canarians arrived. Since 1936, most Canarian immigrants have gone either to Cuba or to Venezuela (some of those who emigrated to Venezuela came from Cuba) because they encouraged immigration, especially of Spanish citizens, and since 1948, most have emigrated to Venezuela, a massive immigration that did not end until the early 1980s, but there was a significant decrease in the 1970s, with the beginning of Canarian emigration to other European countries. Canarians and their descendants are now scattered throughout Venezuela.  Uruguay  The first Canarians to emigrate to Uruguay were settled in Montevideo to populate the region, arriving in two different groups. The first group was established in the city on November 19, 1726, and 25 Canarian families came to Montevideo. They organized quickly to survive in that area. The first civilian authorities in Montevideo were Canarian, and they were first to give Spanish names to roads and geographic features. The second group, with 30 Canarian families, arrived in the city on March 27, 1729. Others places in Uruguay where Canary Islanders settled were Colonia, San Jos√©, Maldonado, Canelones and Soria. In 1808, the Canarian merchant Francisco Aguilar y Leal sent an expedition of 200 people from the eastern islands of the Canaries to Montevideo. Between 1835 and 1845 about 8,200 Canarians, more than half of Lanzarote's population, emigrated to Uruguay, and groups of them continued to come sporadically until about 1900. During the 19th century, more than 10,000 Canarians settled in Uruguay, the majority from the eastern islands; however, only 5700 or so of them remained permanently in Uruguay. A few groups of Canary Islanders continued to arrive through the early 20th century, still coming mainly from the eastern islands, but specific figures are not available. Canarians and Canarian descendants are scattered throughout Uruguay.Balbuena Castellano, Jos√© Manuel. La odisea de los canarios en Texas y Luisiana: XIII, Un p√°rentesis: Los canarios en Uruguay (The odyssey of the Canarians in Texas and Louisiana: XIII, a parenthesis: The Canarian in Uruguay). Pages:154-155. First Edition, 2007. Uruguay ranks fifth after Venezuela, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic in the number of people of Canarian descent among its population.  Canary Islanders in other places in the Americas  = Canarians in Mexico and Central America = Descendants of Canary Islanders are a small community in Mexico, but their presence is notable especially in the business world and in the tourism industry. A few Canarian families emigrated to Mexico in the 17th century (as in the case of the Azuaje families). In the 18th century, when the Spanish crown encouraged Canarian emigration to the Americas through the Tributo de sangre (Blood Tribute), many of them settled in Yucat√°n, where by the 18th century they controlled the trade network that distributed goods throughout the peninsula; their descendants are still counted among the most influential families of direct Spanish descent in Mexico. During the 20th century, another group of Canarians settled in Mexico in the early 1930s, and as with Galician and other Spanish immigrants of the time, there were high rates of illiteracy and impoverishment among them, but they adapted relatively quickly. While the Spanish Civil War was still being fought in Spain, the prominent Canarian intellectual Agustin Millares Carlo from Las Palmas became an expatriate in Mexico in 1938. University professor Jorge Hern√°ndez Millares, who did important work in the subject of geography, went into exile in Mexico after the war.La geograf√≠a escolar en M√©xico (1821-2000) Two Spanish expeditions to Panama were led by Canarians. The first was organized by Pedrarias D√°vila, who recruited fifty good swimmers from Gomera to dive for pearls in 1514. The men, however, were dispersed when they came ashore. Another expedition was led in 1519 by L√≥pez de Sosa, who was appointed by the Spanish government to replace D√°vila and recruited 200 of his neighbors on Gran Canaria to participate in the conquest of Central America.Colombia se conquist√≥ gracias a un peque√±o contingente de 400 canarios (in Spanish) \\"Colombia is Conquered by a Small Contingent of 400 Canary Islanders\\"). In 1534, Bartolom√© Garc√≠a Muxica, founder of Nombre de Dios, Panama, brought a group of Canary Islanders to the country. These were among the few Canarians who emigrated to Panama in that century. In 1787, 306 Canarians arrived on the Mosquito Coast of Honduras. The plan for populating the area failed, however, because of the hostility they encountered from the Zambos and the Miskito Indians, as well as the general unhealthiness of the area. They were able to successfully establish themselves near the Honduran port of Trujillo, where they could farm the surrounding lands, and in the highlands where they founded the town of Macuelizo in 1788. In 1884, over 8,000 Canarians emigrated to a small town in Costa Rica when the country invited Canarian immigration to populate the uninhabited town (some Canarians had already settled in Costa Rica, beginning in the 16th century). Archipi√©lago noticias. Canarios en Chile (in Spanish: Canarians in Chile). Posted Luis Le√≥n Barreto. Retrieved December 21, 2011, to 23:52 pm. A Canarian from Lanzarote island, Jose Martinez, was among the first Spanish settlers to arrive in Costa Rica in the 16th century. =Canary Islanders in other Caribbean and South American countries = The number of Canary islanders who emigrated to Argentina before the 19th century was very low, although three companies of soldiers from Tenerife who were with Pedro de Mendoza when he founded Buenos Aires in 1535 decided to stay, they intermarried with natives and/or other Spanish settlers. Several ships came to Buenos Aires with immigrant Canarians in 1830; a group of them settled in the interior and another group settled in the capital (the descendants of those families have spread gradually throughout the country). Although the number of Canarians who immigrated to Argentina during the 19th century was not comparable to the number of those who emigrated to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Uruguay, in some years there were relatively large numbers of Canarian immigrants; for example, between 1878 and 1888, 3,033 Canarians emigrated. The emigration rate to Argentina was relatively high among the islanders in the 20th century, but did not reach the volume of those who went to Cuba and Venezuela. Even so, in the 1930s, the Canarian government put the number of Canarians and their descendants in that country at about 80,000 people. In 1984 there were 1,038 Canarians in Buenos Aires. They formed several organizations to preserve their ethnic heritage and provide mutual aid. Several Canarian families from Buenos Aires settled in Paraguay, where they founded the town of Candelaria. In Colombia, in 1536, Pedro Fern√°ndez de Lugo led an expedition of 1,500 people, 400 of whom were Canarians from all the different islands that make up the archipelago), for the conquest of the area around what became Santa Marta. This contingent pacified the warring tribes on the coast and penetrated into the interior. On the way, they founded several cities, two which, Las Palmas and Tenerife, still exist. In addition, Pedro de Heredia led 100 men from the Canary Islands to Cartagena de Indias. In the 16th century (a period in which the Canary Islands were still being populated by Spaniards who replaced the indigenous Guanches), many people who emigrated to the Americas from there were, in fact, Spaniards from the mainland of Europe or foreigners, making it difficult to know how many of the immigrants were actually Canarians. There are records also of some Canarians and Canarian families, at least some of them known to be from Lanzarote, who settled in Cartagena de Indias and C√°ceres, Antioquia, in the second half of the 16th century. Others emigrated in 1678 by the terms of theTributo de Sangre to Santa Marta.Morales Padr√≥n, Francisco. Canarias - Am√©rica. Colecci√≥n \\"Guagua\\", 1982. p. 49. In 1903, a fleet arrived in Budi Lake, Chile, with 88 Canarian families‚Äî400 persons‚Äîthat currently have more than 1,000 descendants. They responded to the government's call to populate this region and signed contracts for the benefit of a private company. Some were arrested while trying to escape their servitude, and the indigenous Mapuche people took pity on the plight of these Canarians who were established on their former lands. The Indians welcomed them and joined their demonstrations in the so-called \\"revolt of the Canarians\\", and many Canarians intermarried with Mapuches. Little is known about any Canary emigration to Brazil. It is known, however, that since the 16th century, the Canary Islands were a transit point for European vessels bound for the Americas (many of them to Brazil), and it is likely that some of them were carrying Canarians to the Portuguese colony. Due to the difficult circumstances of travel, several expeditions that had left Lanzarote for Uruguay were forced to end their passage in other places, such as Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina island. By 1812, a small group of Canarians (all of them from Lanzarote) lived on Santa Catarina island, in the south of Brazil.Google Books: Entre el rubor de las auroras: Juan Perdig√≥n, un majorero anarquista en Brasil (in Spanish: Among the blush of the Aurora: Juan Perdig√≥n, a Brazilian anarchist from Fuerteventura island). written by Jes√∫s Gir√°ldez Mac√≠a. Pages 47‚Äì48. A study by W.F. Piazza notes that parish records from 1814 to 1818 show 20 families from Lanzarote living there. Rixo Alvarez speaks of the expeditions of Polycarp Medinilla, a Portuguese based in Lanzarote, and Agust√≠n Gonz√°lez Brito, from Arrecife. The settlers from Lanzarote were forced to disembark in Rio de Janeiro. Only an estimated 50 Canary Islanders emigrated to Brazil in this century.Soldados y colonos canarios e Am√©rica. (in Spanish: Canarians Soldier and settlers in the Americas). Isidoro Santana Gil's teacher During the last years of the 19th century, some propaganda leaflets were printed to promoting the emigration to Brazil of Canarians to work as laborers. How effective they were is unknown. There were other publications distributed in the Canary Islands that opposed emigration movement, and the Canarian press depicted a very negative view of the quality of life for migrants in Brazil. Some ships transporting Canary Islander emigrants to Venezuela during the early 20th century were blown off course and landed in Brazil, the French Antilles, Guayana or Trinidad IslandEmigraci√≥n clandestina en veleros de Canarias a Venezuela a mediados del siglo XX (Illegal immigration in sailing from the Canary Islands to Venezuela in the mid-20th century). Javier Gonzalez Ant√≥n. where they were permanently settled, as well as others who emigrated directly to Brazil from the Canary Islands. A few Canarians on vessels headed to Venezuela were shipwrecked on the Brazilian coast in the 1960s. Due to proximity of Cura√ßao, Aruba, and Bonaire to South America and the establishment of economic ties between the Netherlands (the ruler of Cura√ßao) and Viceroyalty of New Granada (which includes present-day countries of Colombia and Venezuela), Canarian settlers from nearby Venezuela lived on the islands; children from affluent Canarian Venezuelan families were educated on the islands. In the 19th century, Cura√ßaoans such as Manuel Piar and Luis Bri√≥n were prominently engaged in the wars of independence of Venezuela and Colombia. Political refugees from the mainland (such as Simon Bolivar) regrouped in Cura√ßao. While many Canarians returned to Venezuela after its independence, many of them remained in Cura√ßao, Aruba, and Bonaire.

See Gas-liquid contactor. A contactor is an electrically-controlled switch used for switching an electrical power circuit. A contactor is typically controlled by a circuit which has a much lower power level than the switched circuit, such as a 24-volt coil electromagnet controlling a 230-volt motor switch. Unlike general-purpose relays, contactors are designed to be directly connected to high-current load devices. Relays tend to be of lower capacity and are usually designed for both normally closed and normally open applications. Devices switching more than 15 amperes or in circuits rated more than a few kilowatts are usually called contactors. Apart from optional auxiliary low-current contacts, contactors are almost exclusively fitted with normally open (\\"form A\\") contacts. Unlike relays, contactors are designed with features to control and suppress the arc produced when interrupting heavy motor currents. Contactors come in many forms with varying capacities and features. Unlike a circuit breaker, a contactor is not intended to interrupt a short circuit current. Contactors range from those having a breaking current of several amperes to thousands of amperes and 24 V DC to many kilovolts. The physical size of contactors ranges from a device small enough to pick up with one hand, to large devices approximately a meter (yard) on a side. Contactors are used to control electric motors, lighting, heating, capacitor banks, thermal evaporators, and other electrical loads. Construction SPST DC contactor, used in industrial electric vehicles and sometimes used in Electric vehicle (EV) conversions Powerful DC contactor with electro-pneumatic drive A contactor has three components. The contacts are the current-carrying part of the contactor. This includes power contacts, auxiliary contacts, and contact springs. The electromagnet (or \\"coil\\") provides the driving force to close the contacts. The enclosure is a frame housing the contacts and the electromagnet. Enclosures are made of insulating materials such as Bakelite, Nylon 6, and thermosetting plastics to protect and insulate the contacts and to provide some measure of protection against personnel touching the contacts. Open-frame contactors may have a further enclosure to protect against dust, oil, explosion hazards and weather. Magnetic blowouts use blowout coils to lengthen and move the electric arc. These are especially useful in DC power circuits. AC arcs have periods of low current, during which the arc can be extinguished with relative ease, but DC arcs have continuous high current, so blowing them out requires the arc to be stretched further than an AC arc of the same current. The magnetic blowouts in the pictured Albright contactor (which is designed for DC currents) more than double the current the contactor can break, increasing it from 600 A to 1,500 A. Sometimes an economizer circuit is also installed to reduce the power required to keep a contactor closed; an auxiliary contact reduces coil current after the contactor closes. A somewhat greater amount of power is required to initially close a contactor than is required to keep it closed. Such a circuit can save a substantial amount of power and allow the energized coil to stay cooler. Economizer circuits are nearly always applied on direct-current contactor coils and on large alternating current contactor coils. A basic contactor will have a coil input (which may be driven by either an AC or DC supply depending on the contactor design). Universal coils (driven by AC as well as DC) are also available in the market today.Electrical Classroom,, Contactor ‚Äì Construction, Operation, Application and Selection The coil may be energized at the same voltage as a motor the contactor is controlling, or may be separately controlled with a lower coil voltage better suited to control by programmable controllers and lower-voltage pilot devices. Certain contactors have series coils connected in the motor circuit; these are used, for example, for automatic acceleration control, where the next stage of resistance is not cut out until the motor current has dropped. Operating principle When current passes through the electromagnet, a magnetic field is produced, which attracts the moving core of the contactor. The electromagnet coil draws more current initially, until its inductance increases when the metal core enters the coil. The moving contact is propelled by the moving core; the force developed by the electromagnet holds the moving and fixed contacts together. When the contactor coil is de- energized, gravity or a spring returns the electromagnet core to its initial position and opens the contacts. For contactors energized with alternating current, a small part of the core is surrounded with a shading coil, which slightly delays the magnetic flux in the core. The effect is to average out the alternating pull of the magnetic field and so prevent the core from buzzing at twice line frequency. Because arcing and consequent damage occurs just as the contacts are opening or closing, contactors are designed to open and close very rapidly; there is often an internal tipping point mechanism to ensure rapid action. Rapid closing can, however, lead to increase contact bounce which causes additional unwanted open-close cycles. One solution is to have bifurcated contacts to minimize contact bounce; two contacts designed to close simultaneously, but bounce at different times so the circuit will not be briefly disconnected and cause an arc. A slight variant has multiple contacts designed to engage in rapid succession. The first to make contact and last to break will experience the greatest contact wear and will form a high- resistance connection that would cause excessive heating inside the contactor. However, in doing so, it will protect the primary contact from arcing, so a low contact resistance will be established a millisecond later. This technique is only effective if the contactors disengage in reverse order that they engaged. Otherwise the damaging effect of arcing will be split evenly across both contactors. Another technique for improving the life of contactors is contact wipe; the contacts move past each other after initial contact in order to wipe off any contamination. Arc suppression Without adequate contact protection, the occurrence of electric current arcing causes significant degradation of the contacts, which suffer significant damage. An electrical arc occurs between the two contact points (electrodes) when they transition from a closed to an open (break arc) or from an open to a closed (make arc). The break arc is typically more energetic and thus more destructive. The heat developed by the resulting electrical arc is very high, ultimately causing the metal on the contact to migrate with the current. The extremely high temperature of the arc (tens of thousands of degrees Celsius) cracks the surrounding gas molecules creating ozone, carbon monoxide, and other compounds. The arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal, causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter. This activity causes the material in the contacts to degrade over time, ultimately resulting in device failure. For example, a properly applied contactor will have a life span of 10,000 to 100,000 operations when run under power; which is significantly less than the mechanical (non-powered) life of the same device which can be in excess of 20 million operations. Most motor control contactors at low voltages (600 volts and less) are air break contactors; air at atmospheric pressure surrounds the contacts and extinguishes the arc when interrupting the circuit. Modern medium-voltage AC motor controllers use vacuum contactors. High voltage AC contactors (greater than 1,000 volts) may use vacuum or an inert gas around the contacts. High voltage DC contactors (greater than 600 V) still rely on air within specially designed arc-chutes to break the arc energy. High-voltage electric locomotives may be isolated from their overhead supply by roof-mounted circuit breakers actuated by compressed air; the same air supply may be used to \\"blow out\\" any arc that forms. Ratings Contactors are rated by designed load current per contact (pole), maximum fault withstand current, duty cycle, design life expectancy, voltage, and coil voltage. A general purpose motor control contactor may be suitable for heavy starting duty on large motors; so-called \\"definite purpose\\" contactors are carefully adapted to such applications as air-conditioning compressor motor starting. North American and European ratings for contactors follow different philosophies, with North American general purpose machine tool contactors generally emphasizing simplicity of application while definite purpose and European rating philosophy emphasizes design for the intended life cycle of the application. = IEC utilization categories = The current rating of the contactor depends on utilization category. Example IEC categories in standard 60947 are described as: * AC-1 - Non-inductive or slightly inductive loads, resistance furnaces * AC-2 - Starting of slip-ring motors: starting, switching-off * AC-3 - Starting of squirrel-cage motors and switching-off only after the motor is up to speed. (Make Locked Rotor Amps (LRA), Break Full Load Amps (FLA)) * AC-4 - Starting of squirrel-cage motors with inching and plugging duty. Rapid Start/Stop. (Make and Break LRA) Relays and auxiliary contact blocks are rated according to IEC 60947-5-1. *AC-15 - Control of electromagnetic loads (>72 VA) *DC-13 - Control of electromagnets = NEMA = NEMA contactors for low-voltage motors (less than 1,000 volts) are rated according to NEMA size, which gives a maximum continuous current rating and a rating by horsepower for attached induction motors. NEMA standard contactor sizes are designated 00, 0, 1, 2, 3 to 9. The horsepower ratings are based on voltage and on typical induction motor characteristics and duty cycle as stated in NEMA standard ICS2. Exceptional duty cycles or specialized motor types may require a different NEMA starter size than the nominal rating. Manufacturer's literature is used to guide selection for non-motor loads, for example, incandescent lighting or power factor correction capacitors. Contactors for medium-voltage motors (greater than 1,000 volts) are rated by voltage and current capacity. Auxiliary contacts of contactors are used in control circuits and are rated with NEMA contact ratings for the pilot circuit duty required. Normally these contacts are not used in motor circuits. The nomenclature is a letter followed by a three-digit number, the letter designates the current rating of the contacts and the current type (i.e., AC or DC) and the number designates the maximum voltage design values. Applications =Lighting control= Contactors are often used to provide central control of large lighting installations, such as an office building or retail building. To reduce power consumption in the contactor coils, latching contactors are used, which have two operating coils. One coil, momentarily energized, closes the power circuit contacts, which are then mechanically held closed; the second coil opens the contacts. =Magnetic starter= A magnetic starter is a device designed to provide power to electric motors. It includes a contactor as an essential component, while also providing power-cutoff, under-voltage, and overload protection. =Vacuum contactor= Vacuum contactors utilize vacuum bottle encapsulated contacts to suppress the arc. This arc suppression allows the contacts to be much smaller and use less space than air break contacts at higher currents. As the contacts are encapsulated, vacuum contactors are used fairly extensively in dirty applications, such as mining. Vacuum contactors are also widely used at medium voltages from 1000-5000 volts, effectively displacing oil-filled circuit breakers in many applications. Vacuum contactors are only applicable for use in AC systems. The AC arc generated upon opening of the contacts will self-extinguish at the zero-crossing of the current waveform, with the vacuum preventing a re-strike of the arc across the open contacts. Vacuum contactors are therefore very efficient at disrupting the energy of an electric arc and are used when relatively fast switching is required, as the maximum break time is determined by the periodicity of the AC waveform. In the case of 60 Hz power (North American standard), the power will discontinue within 1/120 or 0.008333 of a second. =Mercury relay= A mercury relay, sometimes called a mercury displacement relay, or, mercury contactor, is a relay that uses the liquid metal mercury in an insulated sealed container as the switching element. =Mercury-wetted relay= A mercury-wetted relay is a form of relay, usually a reed relay, in which the contacts are wetted with mercury. These are not considered contactors because they are not intended for currents above 15 amps. Camshaft operation When a series of contactors is to be operated in sequence, this may be done by a camshaft instead of by individual electromagnets. The camshaft may be driven by an electric motor or a pneumatic cylinder. Before the advent of solid-state electronics, the camshaft system was commonly used for speed control in electric locomotives. Differences between a relay and a contactor In addition to their current ratings and rating for motor circuit control, contactors often have other construction details not found in relays. Unlike lower-powered relays, contactors generally have special structures for arc-suppression to allow them to interrupt heavy currents, such as motor starting inrush current. Contactors usually have provision for installation of additional contact blocks, rated for pilot duty, used in motor control circuits. * It is rare to see high coil voltages for relays but often found with contactors with coil voltages from 24 V AC/DC all the way up to 600 V AC possible * Relays often have normally closed contacts; contactors usually do not (when de-energized, there is no connection). * Combination motor starters only use contactors * Switching times are much faster for relays.

Corbie Abbey is a former Benedictine monastery in Corbie, Picardy, France, dedicated to Saint Peter. It was founded by Balthild, the widow of Clovis II, who had monks sent from Luxeuil. The Abbey of Corbie became celebrated both for its library and the scriptorium. Foundation It was founded in about 657/661 under Merovingian royal patronage by Balthild, widow of Clovis II, and her son Clotaire III. The first monks came from Luxeuil Abbey, which had been founded by Saint Columbanus in 590, and the Irish respect for classical learning fostered there was carried forward at Corbie. Theodefrid was the first abbot.Alston, George Cyprian. \\"Monastery of Corbie.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 27 October 2017 The rule of the founders was based on the Benedictine rule, as Columbanus had modified it. Its scriptorium came to be one of the centres of work of manuscript illumination when the art was still fairly new in western Europe. The clear and legible hand known as Carolingian minuscule was also developed at the scriptorium at Corbie,Knox, E.L. Skip. \\"Carolingian Handwriting\\", Boise State University as well as a distinctive style of illumination. In this early Merovingian period, the work of Corbie was innovative in that it showed pictures of people, for example, Saint Jerome. Dr. Tino Licht of Heidelberg University discovered a manuscript from Corbie Abbey written in the Caroline minuscule that predates Charlemagne's rule. According to Dr. Licht, \\"They were trying it out. In the Middle Ages a script like this ...was developed as part of the living tradition of a scriptorium. In the 8th century Corbie was something akin to a laboratory for new scripts.\\" \\"Caroline Minuscule Predates Charlemagne\\", Heidelberg University, 9 January 2013 Besides gifts of estates to support the abbey, many exemptions were granted to the abbots, to free them from interference from local bishops: the exemptions were confirmed in 855 by Pope Benedict III. The abbots ranked as counts and had the privilege of a mint. Medieval period Adam and Eve on a late 12th century capital from the abbey (Mus√©e de Picardie, Amiens) Corbie continued its intimate links with the royal house of the Carolingians. In 774 Desiderius, last King of the Lombards, was exiled here after his defeat by Charlemagne. From 850 to 854 Charles, the future Archbishop of Mainz, was confined here. Members of the Carolingian house sometimes served as abbots; the ninth abbot was Saint Adalard, one of Charlemagne's cousins. Under Adalard, the monastic school of Corbie attained great celebrity and about the same time it sent forth a colony to found the Abbey of Corvey in Saxony. In the ninth century Corbie was larger than St. Martin's Abbey at Tours, or Saint Denis at Paris. At its height it housed 300 monks. Three of Corbie's scholars were Ratramnus (died c. 868), Radbertus Paschasius (died 865) and Hadoard. Saint Gerald of Sauve-Majeure was born in Corbie and became a child oblate at the Abbey, where he then became a monk and served as cellarer. He later went on to found Grande-Sauve Abbey.Walsh, Michael J., \\"Gerald of Sauve-Majeure\\", A New Dictionary of Saints, Liturgical Press, 2007 In 1137 a fire destroyed the monastic buildings but they were rebuilt on a larger scale. Saint Colette of Corbie's father worked as a carpenter at the Abbey. After her parents died, in 1402 she joined the Third Order of St. Francis,Farmer, David (ed.) Oxford Dictionary of Saints, Oxford University Press (1997), p. 108 and became a hermit under the direction of the Abbot of Corbie, and lived near the abbey church. She later founded the Colettine Poor Clares. Commendatory abbots were introduced in 1550, amongst those that held the benefice was Cardinal Mazarin. The somewhat drooping fortunes of the abbey were revived in 1618, when it was one of the first to be incorporated into the new Congregation of Saint Maur. At its suppression in 1790 the buildings were partly demolished, but the church remains to this day, with its imposing portal and western towers. =Library= Corbie was renowned for its library, which was assembled from as far as Italy, and for its scriptorium. The contents of its library are known from catalogues of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. In addition to its patristic writings, it is recognized as an important center for the transmission of the works of Antiquity to the Middle Ages. An inventory (of perhaps the 11th century) lists the church history of Hegesippus, now lost, among other extraordinary treasures. Among students of Tertullian, the library is of interest as it contained a number of unique copies of Tertullian's works, the so-called corpus Corbiense and included some of his unorthodox Montanist treatises, as well as two works by Novatian issued pseudepigraphically under Tertullian's name. The origin of this group of non- orthodox texts has not satisfactorily been identified. Among students of medieval architecture and engineering, such as are preserved in the notebooks of Villard de Honnecourt, Corbie is of interest as the center of renewed interest in geometry and surveying techniques, both theoretical and practical, as they had been transmitted from Euclid through the Geometria of Boethius and works by Cassiodorus (Zenner). In 1638, Cardinal Richelieu ordered the transfer of 400 manuscripts transferred to the library of the monastery of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s in Paris. During the French Revolution, the library was closed and the last of the monks dispersed: 300 manuscripts still at Corbie were moved to Amiens, 15 km to the west. Those at St-Germain des Pr√©s were released on the market, and many rare manuscripts were obtained by a Russian diplomat, Petrus Dubrowsky, and sent to St. Petersburg. Other Corbie manuscripts are at the Biblioth√®que Nationale. Over two hundred manuscripts from the great library at Corbie are known to survive. Modern times Jean Mabillon, the father of paleography, had been a monk at Corbie. The village of Corbie grew up round Corbie Abbey and was close to the fighting during the Battle of the Somme. Between 22 April and 10 May 1918, Corbie was heavily shelled by the Germans and the church sustained many direct hits.\\"Corbie Abbey\\", Australian War Memorial Burials *Radbertus Paschasius *Saint Martin of Arades (died 726) *Desiderius (died here) List of abbots This list is drawn from the Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie Ecclesiastique. ;Regular abbots ;Commendatory abbots *1522-1550 : Cardinal Philippe I de La Chambre *1550-1556 : S√©bastien II de La Chambre *1556-1558 : Cardinal Louis de Bourbon-Vend√¥me *1558-1580 : cardinal Charles de Bourbon *1580-1603 : cardinal Louis II de Lorraine *1603-1623 : cardinal Louis III de Lorraine *1623-1643 : Henri II de Lorraine-Guise *1643-1645 : cardinal Jules Mazarin *1645-1647 : Camille Pamphili *1647-1661 : cardinal Jules Mazarin (again) *1661-1669 : Vacance *1669-1693 : Philippe II de Savoie-Carignan *1693-1713 : cardinal Toussaint de Forbin-Janson *1713-1742 : cardinal Melchior de Polignac *1742-1755 : Jean-Fran√ßois Boyer *1755-1788 : cardinal Paul de Luynes *1788-1792 : cardinal √âtienne-Charles de Lom√©nie de Brienne See also * Merovingian script Notes Further reading * David Ganz: Corbie in the Carolingian Renaissance (Beihefte der Francia, 20), Sigmaringen (Thorbecke) 1990, .

He became famous in 2003 under his stage name \\"Pikku G\\" which refers to his small size (= \\"pikku\\") and to \\"Genetic\\", his old breakdance name. Henri V√§h√§kainu's first hip-hop album, R√§j√§hdysvaara, was the best- selling recording in the country in 2003. The second album, Suora l√§hetys, released the following year, also sold platinum (more than 20,000). In 2008, he released two singles under the artist name Gee, but since 2017, after a break of years, he is touring again under the name Little G. In 2019, he released an album called Kilometrit. V√§h√§kainu has produced other hip-hop artists with the Coach Beats producer group. Since 2011 he is leading an IT technology company called AppGyver with his partner.  Musical career  At the age of 15, in 2002, Henri V√§h√§kainu won the Rockin ‚ÄôDa North demo competition, organized by the then Radiomafia, now YleX (Finnish Broadcasting Company) after which he entered the studio with the Rockin da North group. The book Pikku G by journalist Carla Ahonius was published in 2004 , the same year Pikku G was chosen as the most positive Finn of the year. Henri V√§h√§kainu produces other artists in his producer group Coach Beats. The group was formed in 2005. Since that it has produced songs for Finnish rap groups and artists such as Kapasiteettiyksikk√∂ and Travis Bicle. Henri V√§h√§kainu In May 2008, V√§h√§kainu announced a comeback in the music market under the artist name Gee. On March 29, 2017, V√§h√§kainu returned to the stage at a student event in Turku, under the name Pikku G. Inspired by it, he was also performing at three summer festivals. In the summer of 2017, Pikku G signed a new record deal with Warner Music Finland. He released a new song in \\"Solmussa\\" on December 1, 2017, featuring fresh singer Behm.  Personal life and society  According to his LinkedIn profile Henri V√§h√§kainu graduated from the Heltech Audiovisual Degree Program at the Helsinki School of Technology in 2008. His studies included animation and graphic design, among other things. After graduating, V√§h√§kainu gained work experience in the audiovisual field in Finland, after which he moved to the United States for six months to produce music for local artists. He ran for a place in the Finnish Parliament in the 2007 elections from the list of Finnish Centre party, but was not elected. He supported Finnish prime minister Matti Vanhanen in 2006 Finnish presidential election. Since then he has been independent and has not been politically active. In September 2009, V√§h√§kainu was convicted of aggravated driving under the influence. He received a suspended sentence of 45 days and was day- fined. V√§h√§kainu was investigated due to his alleged involvement of arranging a meeting between a cocaine dealer and potential customers in October 2009, while still on probation. A text message sent by him to the dealer was presented as an evidence in court. He denied any such involvement. On March 30, 2010 V√§h√§kainu was convicted of distributing ten grams of cocaine and sentenced to pay 80 day-fines. In 2011, V√§h√§kainu became a start-up founder and a partner at the technology company AppGyver. This full turn in life brought by entrepreneurship has inspired him also to social responsibility projects. He has organized local events at his former school in Nurmij√§rvi and given lectures in schools about entrepreneurship, among other things. V√§h√§kainu was also participating in a charity recording by 150 musicians and raising funds for the Red Cross. V√§h√§kainu is from a pentecostalist family. Henri V√§h√§kainu has been nominated as a candidate for the most positive phenomenon in Nurmij√§rvi in 2020.  Start-up career  After graduating in audio visual studies in 2008, Henri V√§h√§kainu worked for two agencies in the audiovisual area but decided to move to the U.S. to produce music. After returning to Finland, he started a business with a colleague, Marko Lehtim√§ki. Their first company developed mobile applications, e.g. for artists and athletes. However, the company did not take off. There were no rapidly scalable solutions for mobile application development, making customization of individual applications laborious and unprofitable. This setback was, however, a start for the next business. Two colleagues, Marko Lehtim√§ki and Antti Hannula, launched AppGyver Oy. According to his LinkedIn profile, Henri V√§h√§kainu joined the company in May 2011 and started to build its success. He is the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the company. AppGyver develops digital tools, ready-made blocks for creating business-enhancing mobile applications. AppGyver is known for its innovativeness and therefore, the American online publication TechCrunch, among others, has included AppGyver in the start-ups to be followed regularly.

Cimbri and Teutons defeats. Cimbri and Teutons victories. Teutobod was a king of the Teutons, who, together with the Cimbri invaded the Roman Republic in the Cimbrian War, won a spectacular victory at the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC. He was captured at the Battle of Aquae Sextiae in 102 BC.  Life  In the late 2nd century BC, together with their neighbors, allies and possible relatives, the Cimbri, the Teutons attacked south into the Danube valley, southern Gaul and northern Italy. Here they began to intrude upon the lands of Rome (Julius Caesar, in his Gallic Wars account De Bello Gallico, reports that it was the Boii who had attacked Noricum). The inevitable conflict which followed is called the Cimbrian War. The Cimbri (under their King Boiorix) and the Teutons, won the opening battles of this war, defeating tribes allied with the Romans and destroying a huge Roman army at the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC. But Rome regrouped and reorganized under Consul Gaius Marius. In 104 BC the Cimbri left the Rh√¥ne valley to raid Spain, while the Teutons remained in Gaul, still strong but not powerful enough to march on Rome on their own. This gave Marius time to build a new army and in 102 BC he moved against the Teutons. At the Battle of Aquae Sextiae the Teutons were virtually annihilated and Teutobod along with, reportedly, 20,000 of his people were captured. After this, he and his tribe drop out from history. He most likely was sent to Rome for a triumphal procession to celebrate his defeat, then ritually executed afterwards. The following year, the Cimbri would suffer a similar fate at the Battle of Vercellae, where two of their leaders, Caesorix and Claodicus, were captured, while two other leaders, Boiorix and Lugius, were killed.

Life The son of a newspaper editor, Bell was born in London and educated at Uppingham School in Rutland. At the age of 19 he ventured into the countryside in Hundon, Suffolk, to learn about agriculture, and he farmed in various locations over the next sixty years, until his death in September 1980. His work on farms included the rebuilding of a near-derelict smallholding at Redisham, near Beccles. Out of his early experiences of farming at Bradfield St. George, in Suffolk, came the book Corduroy, published in 1930. Bell's friend, the author and poet Edmund Blunden, advised him and helped secure his first publishing deal. Corduroy was an immediate best-seller and was followed by two more books on the countryside, Silver Ley in 1931 and The Cherry Tree in 1932, the three books forming a ruralist farm trilogy. The popularity of literary back-to-the-land writing in England in the 1930s can be put in the context of, for example, Vita Sackville-West's long narrative poem The Land. The Penguin Books paperback edition of Corduroy came out in 1940 and was much prized by soldiers serving during the Second World War. Bell wrote the \\"Countryman‚Äôs Notebook\\" column in the Eastern Daily Press from 1950, and produced over twenty other books on the countryside, including Apple Acre (1942), Sunrise to Sunset (1944), The Budding Morrow (1946), The Flower and the Wheel (1949), Music in the Morning, (1954), A Suffolk Harvest (1956), the autobiographical My Own Master (1961) and The Green Bond (1976). Bell was friendly with many literary and cultural figures, including Edmund Blunden, F.R. Leavis, H.J. Massingham, Alfred Munnings, John Nash and Henry Williamson.K D M Snell. Bell, Adrian Hanbury, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 When The Times began to lose circulation to The Daily Telegraph because the latter was running a daily crossword, Bell's father suggested him to the editor as the first \\"setter\\" even though he had never even solved one. Bell had just 10 days' notice before his first puzzle was published, in the weekly edition on 2 January 1930. Having set around 5,000 puzzles between 1930 and 1978, Bell is credited with helping to establish its distinctive cryptic clue style. The first full length critical appreciation of his work, by Richard Hawking, was published by The Crowood Press in April 2019. Family His son, Martin Bell, is a former BBC war reporter, and was an independent Member of Parliament between 1997 and 2001. Things that Endure, a half-hour BBC radio documentary on Adrian Bell presented by his son, was broadcast on 2 September 2005 on Radio 4. His daughter, Anthea Bell, who died in 2018, was a translator known for her English versions of Franz Kafka, Sigmund Freud, W. G. Sebald and the Asterix comic books.

He was a political dissident and after the war he opposed the Anti- Soviet policy of Josip Broz Tito, president of Yugoslavia. He spent a total of 24 years in Yugoslav prisons as a political dissident for advocating anti- Titoism and Proletarian internationalism. After the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1990s, he founded the Party of Labour in Serbia. He criticised Tito, as well as Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, for departing from Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. He accused them for leaning towards capitalism and the latter two for exposing the Soviet Union to the collapse. He was the younger brother of famous Montenegrin socialist leader Peko Dapƒçeviƒá. Early life Dapƒçeviƒá was born 1917 in the village Ljubotinj in the Kingdom of Montenegro, he attended secondary school in Cetinje where he was expelled because of organizing a student strike. At 16, in 1933, he became a member of the Alliance of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia (SKOJ). That very same year he was arrested for the first time due to taking part in distribution of communist leaflets. He was accepted into Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1934. In Cetinje, 1935, during Party demonstrations and clash with the police he was arrested and brutally beaten. He spent a month in jail, after which he continued his education in Podgorica, Nik≈°iƒá, and Prizren. He was eventually expelled from all these schools. Because of a break within KPJ in 1936 and the following mass arrests of Party members, the Party in Montenegro organized (dangerous) manifestations causing clashes with the police. Dapƒçeviƒá was arrested and spent four months in the Sarajevo jail. In 1937, he was promoted to the post of Organizing Party Secretary in Cetinje. At the same time he signed up as a volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, on the Republican side. But police discovered the plot and arrested a large group of volunteers, including Dapƒçeviƒá. After his release in 1939, the authorities allowed him to graduate from secondary school in Kotor, and he was accepted for studies at the School of Chemical Engineering in Belgrade. At Belgrade University he took a part in struggles for University autonomy from the Royal Government. In a clash with pro-royalist youths he gained a serious head injury. During 1940, he went on a Party assignment to Boka Kotorska in Montenegro, where he worked on organizing Party cells. But the local KPJ committee dissolved due to internal misunderstandings and Dapƒçeviƒá headed back to Belgrade. World War II Dapƒçeviƒá was living in Belgrade when, on April 6, 1941, the Luftwaffe unleashed a savage bombing of the city. As Yugoslavia surrendered to Nazi Germany, Dapƒçeviƒá moved from Belgrade back to Montenegro where he was active in the organization of resistance. However, shortly after a rebellion attack in ƒåevo on July 13, 1941, he was expelled from the Party. As a fighter of the Lovƒáen Battalion, he took part in the assault on Pljevlja, in which he was wounded, and he also played a part in the founding of the First Proletarian Brigade in Rudo, and crossed Mount Igman at Sarajevo. He was re-admitted into the Party in Foƒça in early 1942, and designated political Commissar for the Drina Volunteer (Partisan) Detachment. By mid-1942, he was promoted to commander of the First Detachment of the Lovƒáen Battalion. However, due to his continued criticism of the Party, he was once again expelled. As a commander of a bombing squad, he took part in many actions until he was, once again, wounded at the end of 1942. He also took part in battles on Neretva and Sutjeska. After these, he was again re-admitted into the Party and assigned as the party for the Seventh Krajina Brigade. During the first half of 1944, he was promoted to the Headquarters Officer School, and then to Commissar of the Tenth Division of NOVJ. When the war ended, he held the rank of a lieutenant colonel in the Yugoslav People's Army. After the war, he worked as a professor at the Party School for Officers, and in 1947, he was promoted to JNA Chief of Administration for Agitation and Propaganda (Agitprop). After the war In 1948, he attended the Fifth Party Congress. However, as he was in favor of the resolutions of the Information Bureau, he was forced to flee the country. He attempted to leave Yugoslavia together with his companion Arso Jovanoviƒá, an army general and the chief of army headquarters. They tried to cross the border with Romania but were stopped by the border guards. In the skirmish, Jovanoviƒá was shot to death, while Dapƒçeviƒá escaped unscathed and spent the following months in hiding in Belgrade. In the fall of 1948, he attempted to escape to Hungary, but was arrested and kept in custody for a total of 22 months before finally receiving a 20-year jail sentence. From June 1950 to December 6, 1956, he was imprisoned in concentration camps at Stara Gradi≈°ka, Bileƒáa and Goli Otok, and each time exposed to brutal torture. After his early release and due to the threat of re-arrest, he escaped to Albania in 1958 with a group of comrades. After a couple of months, they traveled to and settled in the USSR. Upon arrival in the USSR, he was offered to continue with his education or accept a corresponding job. He refused this offer and continued with his political work. During 1961, he organized strong propaganda for the Conference of Communist Parties in Moscow. As a result, thanks in part to his activity, the Conference adopted the resolution of condemnation of the Yugoslav Communist Alliance (SKJ) as a revisionist and an Anti-Marxist party. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Dapƒçeviƒá and other √©migr√©s organized volunteer groups to Cuba, but were prevented from departing by the Soviet authorities. Between 1964 and 1965, Dapƒçeviƒá lived in Odessa where he worked on a doctoral dissertation on the Yugoslav workers movement. In early 1965, he wanted to join the communist forces fighting the Vietnam War as a volunteer, but was still not allowed to leave the Soviet Union. He finally left the Soviet Union in 1966, by illegally emigrating to Western Europe. He lived in France, Switzerland and the Netherlands, where he mostly worked as a physical laborer. He strove to develop political dissent among the Yugoslav economic emigration (gastarbeiters), but with little result. He was arrested several times and deported from each of the three countries he had been staying in. In 1969, he managed to obtain permanent residence in Belgium . In Brussels, he married a Belgian citizen and lived in Ixelles near the Brussels university ULB .In 1975 even became a Belgian citizen himself. While there, he kept in touch with West European Marxist‚ÄìLeninist groups and took part in their activities. In 1973, he survived an assassination attempt by UDBA. In 1975, the Romanian and Yugoslav secret services organized Dapƒçeviƒá's kidnapping while he was visiting Bucharest, after which he was extradited to Yugoslavia. He had been sentenced to death in absentia, but the punishment was commuted to 20 years of hard labor (this leniency was shown to him as his brother Peko Dapƒçeviƒá was a renowned army general and World War II hero). He was released from the Po≈æarevac prison in 1988, and promptly expelled from Yugoslavia. Dapƒçeviƒá was allowed to return to Yugoslavia in September 1990, in the midst of political turmoil. In his many interviews and public appearances he indicated there was an imminent danger of civil war and dissolution of Yugoslavia. On March 27, 1992, he founded the Party of Labour and during the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, he actively worked on the strengthening of democracy and unity against the Milo≈°eviƒá government. Between 1992 and 1996, he attended Marxist‚ÄìLeninist party conferences and meetings. In 1997, at the first Party of Labour congress, Dapƒçeviƒá set the party program and political aims, laying foundations for a real revolutionary party in Yugoslavia. Dapƒçeviƒá continued with political activities until his death on July 12, 2001. He was a strong advocate of an independent Montenegro.http://www.montenegro- canada.com/articles/article/2509423/73885.htm See also * Informbiro * Yugoslav Partisans * Peko Dapƒçeviƒá * Arso Jovanoviƒá External links * Vlado Dapƒçeviƒá - Partija Rada * Memoirs of Vlado Dapƒçeviƒá (in Serbo-Croatian)  Sources  Category:1917 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:Anti-revisionists Category:People sentenced to death in absentia Category:Yugoslav escapees Category:Escapees from Yugoslav detention Category:League of Communists of Montenegro politicians Category:Party of Labour (Serbia) politicians Category:Officers of the Yugoslav People's Army Category:Yugoslav dissidents Category:Montenegrin communists Category:People from Cetinje Category:Montenegrin atheists Category:Yugoslav emigrants to the Soviet Union Category:People granted political asylum in the Soviet Union ","title":"Vlado Dapƒçeviƒá"},{"id":"2626040","text":"703 No√´mi, provisional designation , is a stony Florian asteroid and possible slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 8.5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory on 3 October 1910. The asteroid was likely named for Baroness Valentine No√©mi von Springer (n√©e von Rothschild; 1886‚Äì1968).  Orbit and classification  No√´mi is a member of the Flora family, the 3rd largest main-belt asteroid family with nearly 14,000 known members. This asteroid orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9‚Äì2.5 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,171 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Vienna, 3 days after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  No√´mi has been characterized as a common stony S-type asteroid based on its classification to the Flora family. = Lightcurves = In December 2016, a rotational lightcurve of No√´mi was obtained from photometric observations. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.8 magnitude (), superseding a previous inconclusive observation by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini from February 2011. The lightcurve's large amplitude of 0.8 magnitude is typically indicative of a non-spheroidal shape (an elongated, irregular shape). As of July 2017, the asteroid is only a possible slow rotator as the lightcurve's quality has not been rated. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, No√´mi measures between 7.250 and 9.85 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.19 and 0.486. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of its family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 8.58 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.5.  Naming  According to A. Schnell, this minor planet was probably named for Baroness Valentine No√©mi von Rothschild (1886‚Äì1969) to celebrate her engagement to Baron Sigismund von Springer (1873‚Äì1927). Baroness von Springer was the only daughter of Baron Albert von Rothschild, a banker, steam-railway pioneer, philanthropist, and astronomy enthusiast who had recently donated a stereocomparator to the Vienna Observatory and who, in 1885, had given the observatory 10,000 gulden for purchase of its coud√©-focus equatorial telescope. The baroness's property was \\"Aryanized\\" during the 1938 Anschluss. Baroness von Springer's niece, Baroness Bettina - named after Baroness Valentine No√©mi de Rothschild's mother, Bettina ‚Äì was mentioned in 1998 news stories, when Austria passed a law returning to Rothschild heirs such treasures as remained in Austrian museums. The naming of Noemi was published in Sirius journal in 1911 and in Astronomische Nachrichten in 1912 (). See also: 250 Bettina, 719 Albert.

Together with Masnedsund Bridge it connects Falster and Zealand (Sj√¶lland). It was the main road connection between the islands until the Far√∏ Bridges were opened in 1985. It is still part of the railway connection between the islands of Lolland, Falster, and Zealand. It is on the rail line between Copenhagen and Hamburg, Germany. History The bridge was designed by the bridge department at the Danish State Railways (DSB), headed by Anker Engelund and with the assistance of Danish company Christiani & Nielsen. The initial design proposal described a bridge with double-tracked railway, three steel-arch main spans, and concrete deck arch approach spans. In the autumn of 1932, the British company Dorman, Long & Co. submitted a tender to build the Storstr√∏m Bridge as a steel bridge. As the submitted tender was not entirely acceptable, the DSB prepared a new project proposal which was granted to Dorman, Long & Co. without a public tender. The contract for the work was signed on 13 May 1933, with the steel superstructure to be constructed by Dorman, Long & Co., while the substructure and earthworks were assigned to Christiani & Nielsen as subcontractor. Guy Anson Maunsell was appointed as managing director of the consortium. The Storstr√∏m Bridge was opened by King Christian X on 26 September 1937; the ceremony was attended by more than 40,000 people. The total cost of the Storstr√∏m Bridge amounted to DKK 28.5 million, or approximately DKK 41.0 million if also counting the Masnedsund Bridge and associated road and rail construction work. =Damage concerns= On 18 October 2011, Banedanmark announced the immediate cancellation of rail traffic across the bridge after a crack in one of the spans was discovered. Further investigation revealed a total of 11 cracks between 17 and 55 cm in length. One of the two road lanes was also partially closed while repairs were being made. The bridge reopened to light rail traffic on 21 November 2011, and to regular rail traffic on 23 January 2012. Structure The Storstr√∏m Bridge is 3,199 metres long and 9 metres wide. The three tied-arch main spans have lengths of 103.9 m, 137.8 m and 103.9 m, respectively. The central span has a clearance below of , tapering off to in the two others. The inter-arch bracing is built as a double Warren truss. The bridge has a total of 50 spans. The approach span configuration is somewhat unusual, with piers spaced alternately 57.8 m and 62.2 m apart and suspended spans placed in the longer spans. The road deck is wide. The bridge has 49 piers of different heights, extending to a maximum water depth of 13.8 metres. Each pier rests upon concrete foundations cast on the excavated bed of the sea, inside a cofferdam. Some piers could be excavated and cast with the cofferdam empty of water, where the soil was sufficiently waterproof, but others had to be excavated and cast underwater. Steel sheet piles were driven into the bed around the cofferdam. The foundations were continued upwards to a level 3 metres below the water surface. The section of pier from 3 metres below water level to 3 metres above was made from pre-cast and granite clad concrete shells. These were set into position and then filled with concrete. The remainder of the height of each pier was created using sliding steel forms. The upper sections of the piers are hollow. Piers full height extends to a maximum of 38 metres. Bridge deck showing two narrow road lanes (without centre line) and one rail (without overhead wire) Future As part of the planned Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link project, the railway from Ringsted to R√∏dbyhavn will be electrified, and between Vordingborg and R√∏dbyhavn also converted from single track to double track. Initial plans left the Storstr√∏m Bridge as an exception to the double- track conversion, but the expected increase in traffic in combination with the discovery of the poor condition of the bridge resulted in the decision to replace the Storstr√∏m Bridge entirely. =Replacement= As the bridge was found to be in poor condition in 2011, Banedanmark was tasked with investigating different long-term solutions. Their recommendation was to build a new bridge, and in August 2012, the Danish government proposed allocation of funds for the construction of a new bridge.Ny Storstr√∏msbro skal give 5.000 jobs Parliamentary agreement to build a replacement for the Storstr√∏m bridge was reached on 21 March 2013, and the construction act () was passed on 26 May 2015. The new bridge is commissioned by Vejdirektoratet and preliminary designed by Danish companies COWI, Dissing+Weitling and Hasl√∏v & Kj√¶rsgaard. In October 2017, it was announced that a joint venture of the Italian companies Itinera, Condotte and Grandi Lavori Fincosit had been selected to build the bridge with the design of Studio de Miranda Associati. The new bridge will be a single-pylon cable-stayed bridge with an electrified double- tracked railway allowing speeds of , two road lanes allowing and a foot and bicycle path. It is scheduled to open to road traffic in 2022, and to rail traffic in 2023. The construction budget for the new bridge is about DKK 2.1 billion, out of a total project budget of approx. DKK 4.1 billion. The ground breaking ceremony of the new bridge took place on 27 September 2018. The current Storstr√∏m Bridge is set to be demolished once the new bridge is completed. Cultural references In 1950, Carl Th. Dreyer, one of Denmark's most famous filmmakers, normally known for his drama productions, made a short documentary about the bridge.

History A mission station was founded by Roman Catholic Father Richard Docherty in 1935 at Werntek Nganayi (Old Mission), and subsequently moved to a new location with superior water, gardening and building sites and landing place.F.X. Gsell, The Bishop with 150 Wives (Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1956), pp. 150-2; J. Pye, The Port Keats Story (Kensington, 1973); Port Keats 1935-, German Missionaries in Australia. Description Wadeye is mainly inhabited by Indigenous Australians. The inhabitants include seven language groups, the main language that is spoken being Murrinhpatha. The indigenous population has five traditional bands or kinship groups of Nangiomeri, Marimanindji, Marithiel, Maringar and Mulluk Mulluk. Port Keats is also the site of a temporary ADF Radar site that is used during exercises conducted in the Top End. Art and culture Nym Bunduk was the first painter in Wadeye who had international interest. He was asked by Bill Stanner, an anthropologist who had come with Richard Docherty in 1935, to produce pieces explaining traditional law, which he made after he saw a map produced by Stanner. He produced many bark paintings of the dreaming which informed Stanner's research. Today in Wadeye Mark Crocomb follows in the footsteps of Stanner collecting history and languages before they are lost. Following in the tradition of Nym Bundak is Richard 'Skunky' Parmbuk. He is one of many artists filling the space left by Nym in Wadeye. Transport Wadeye has a sealed airstrip, Port Keats Airfield, with regular passenger flights to Darwin. Road access is mostly unsealed via the Port Keats/ Daly River Road. Wadeye is only accessible by road during the dry season as the wet season renders many river crossings impassable.

This aldehyde is a colourless oily liquid that is soluble in a wide range of solvents. It reacts with water to form chloral hydrate, a once widely used sedative and hypnotic substance. Production Chloral was first prepared, and named, by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1832.See: * pp. 189‚Äì191 \\"Wirkung des Chlors auf Alkohol\\" [Reaction of Chlorine with alcohol [i.e., ethanol ; pp. 191‚Äì194 \\"Darstellung des Chloral[s]\\" [Preparation of chloral] ; pp. 195‚Äì198 \\"Eigenschaften des Chlorals\\" [Properties of chloral]. Liebig named chloral on p. 191. From p. 191: \\"Ich werde in dem Folgenden zeigen, dass bei einer vollkommnen Zersetzung des Alkohols das Chlor den Wasserstoff desselben abscheidet und diesen Wasserstoff ersetzt; es entsteht eine neue eigenth√ºmliche Verbindung von Chlor, Kohlenstoff und Sauerstoff, welche ich, indem ich keinen zweckm√§ssigeren Namen weiss, vorl√§ufig Chloral nenne. Dieser Name ist dem Worte Aethal nachgebildet.\\" (In the following, I will show that during a complete breakdown of ethanol, chlorine removes its [i.e., ethanol's] hydrogen and replaces this hydrogen; there arises a strange new compound of chlorine, carbon, and oxygen, which I ‚Äî as I know no more appropriate name ‚Äî provisionally name \\"chloral\\". This name is patterned after the word Aethal [i.e., ethyl].) * Reprinted in: pp. 250-252 \\"Wirkung des Chlors auf Alkohol\\" [Reaction of Chlorine with alcohol [i.e., ethanol ; pp. 252‚Äì255 \\"Darstellung des Chloral[s]\\" [Preparation of chloral] ; pp. 255‚Äì259 \\"Eigenschaften des Chlorals\\" [Properties of chloral]. * Liebig treated anhydrous ethanol with dry chlorine gas.Liebig passed dry chlorine gas through anhydrous ethanol for 11‚Äì13 days, until hydrogen chloride ceased to form. The product was dried by shaking with concentrated sulfuric acid, decanted over chalk, and then distilled. (Liebig, 1832), pp. 191‚Äì194. Chloral is produced commercially by the chlorination of acetaldehyde in the presence of hydrochloric acid, producing chloral hydrate. Ethanol can also be used as a feedstock. This reaction is catalyzed by antimony trichloride: :H3CCHO + 3 Cl2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí Cl3CCH(OH)2 \\\\+ 3 HCl The chloral hydrate is distilled from the reaction mixture. The distillate is then dehydrated with concentrated sulfuric acid, after which the heavier acid layer (containing the water) is drawn off: :Cl3CCH(OH)2 ‚Üí Cl3CCHO + H2O The resulting product is purified by fractional distillation. Small amounts of chloral hydrate occur in some chlorinated water. Key reactions Chloral tends to form adducts with water (to give chloral hydrate) and alcohols. Aside from its tendency to hydrate, chloral is notable as a building block in the synthesis of DDT. For this purpose, chloral is treated with chlorobenzene in the presence of a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid: : Cl3CCHO + 2 C6H5Cl ‚Üí Cl3CCH(C6H4Cl)2 \\\\+ H2O This reaction was described by Othmar Zeidler in 1874. The related herbicide methoxychlor is also produced from chloral. Treating chloral with sodium hydroxide gives chloroform Cl3CH and sodium formate HCOONa. : Cl3CCHO + NaOH -> Cl3CH + HCOONa Chloral is easily reduced to trichloroethanol, which is produced in the body from chloral. Safety Chloral and chloral hydrate have the same properties biologically since the former hydrates rapidly. Chloral hydrate was routinely administered to patients on the gram scale with no lasting effects. Prolonged exposure to the vapors is unhealthy with a LC50 for 4-hour exposure of 440 mg/m3.

Washed sperm is used in artificial insemination using the intrauterine insemination (IUI) technique and in in vitro fertilization (IVF). It may also be used to decrease the risk of HIV transmission by an HIV-positive male, in which case the washed sperm is injected into a female using an artificial insemination technique. Sperm washing involves removing any mucus and non- motile sperm in the semen to improve the chances of fertilization and to extract certain disease-carrying material in the semen. Sperm washing is a standard procedure in infertility treatment. Once the fastest sperm have been isolated, before using them for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization, it is important to confirm the absence of HIV virus in the sample. The sample obtained after washing is analysed, usually using the PCR technique, to check that there is no viral particle. If the result is negative, i.e. there is no virus, this sample is suitable for use in assisted reproduction treatments. These samples are usually free of the virus in a high percentage. Procedure Sperm washing takes place in a laboratory following sperm donation. Sperm may be washed by density gradient centrifugation or by a \\"direct swim-up\\" technique that does not involve centrifugation. In normal semen samples, centrifugation causes no more DNA damage to spermatozoa than a direct swim-up technique. Washed sperm is concentrated in Hams F10 media without L-glutamine, warmed to .Adams, Robert, M.D.\\"invitro fertilization technique\\", Monterey, CA, 1988 A chemical known as a cryoprotectant is added to the sperm to aid the freezing and thawing process. Further chemicals may be added which separate the most active sperm in the sample, as well as extend or dilute the sample so that vials for a number of inseminations are produced. Decreased HIV transmission Sperm washing can be used to decrease the risk of HIV transmission in HIV-positive males, because the infection is carried by the seminal fluid rather than the sperm. One Italian study from 2005 of 567 serodiscordant couples treated with washed sperm resulted in no horizontal (to the woman) or vertical (to the child) HIV seroconversion.About.com > HIV and Sperm Washing. By Mark Cichocki, R.N. Updated December 18, 2009 However, there is no 100% guarantee that washed sperm is free from the virus. History Sperm washing was first used in Milan, Italy. The oldest child conceived using this method was born in 1997 and is HIV negative. The first known baby conceived this way in the United States, Baby Ryan, was born in 1999 through the Special Program of Assisted Reproduction started by Ann Kiessling. Starting in the mid-1990s the technique was used to help HIV discordant couples conceive without passing the virus from the father to the mother or child. The idea is that when the male is HIV positive, the technique will reduce the risk of transmission to the female. For years there were lingering doubts about the safety of the procedure, and many couples had to travel to places that would do the procedure, such as Italy. Today, hundreds of babies have been born through this process.

The book has been adapted twice for the cinema: first in 1956 and later in 1991. Now a modern crime classic, Levin's story centers on a charming, intelligent man who will stop at nothing, even murder, to get where he wants to go. His problem is a pregnant woman who loves him. The solution involves desperate measures. Plot Bud Corliss is a young man with a ruthless drive to rise above his working-class origins to a life of wealth and importance. He serves in the Pacific in World War II, and upon his honorable discharge in 1947 he learns that his father was killed in an automobile accident while he was overseas. The most pivotal moment in his life occurs during the war, when he first wounds, then kills, a Japanese sniper, who is so terrified that he wets his pants and begs for mercy. Corliss is elated by the total power he holds over the soldier; at the same time, he is disgusted by the man's display of abject terror. Upon returning to the U.S., he enrolls in college and meets Dorothy Kingship, the daughter of a wealthy copper tycoon. Seeing an opportunity to attain the riches he has always craved, he becomes Dorothy's lover. When she tells him she is pregnant, however, he panics; he is sure that her stern, conservative father will disinherit her. Resolving to get rid of Dorothy, he tricks her into writing a letter that, to an unknowing observer, would look like a suicide note, and then throws her from the roof of a tall building. He runs no risk of getting caught, having urged Dorothy to keep their relationship a secret from her family and friends. He continues to live with his mother, who dotes on him and has no clue as to what he has done. Corliss lies low for a few months until the press coverage of Dorothy's death has subsided. Then he pursues Dorothy's sister, Ellen. The romance is going according to plan until Ellen begins to probe into Dorothy's death, convinced her sister did not kill herself. Eventually, Ellen uncovers the truth about Corliss and confronts him. Corliss nonchalantly confesses to the crime and kills Ellen as well. Unfazed by this setback, Corliss courts the last remaining Kingship daughter, Marion. This affair is the most successful; Corliss sweeps her off her feet and charms her father, and soon he and Marion are engaged. Local college DJ Gordon Gant, who met Ellen during her investigation of Dorothy's death, begins investigating the case, and is immediately suspicious of Corliss. He breaks into Corliss' childhood home and steals a written plan for meeting and seducing Marion to get her family's money. Days before the wedding, he shows up at the Kingship family home and presents Marion and her father with the evidence of Corliss' deception. On a trip to one of the Kingship family's copper manufacturing plants, Marion, her father and Gant all corner Corliss while he is standing over a vat of molten copper and threaten to expose him. Corliss frantically pleads his innocence, but his accusers are unmoved. Realizing his luck has finally run out, Bud Corliss panics and wets his pants ‚Äì just as the Japanese soldier, his symbol of pathetic cowardice, had done. Delirious with fear and shame, Bud Corliss stumbles and falls to his death into the vat below. Characters * Burton (Bud) Corliss * Dorothy Kingship * Mrs. Corliss * Ellen Kingship * Marion Kingship * Gordon Gant * Leo Kingship * Dwight Powell * The teacher who helps Ellen Kingship Adaptations The novel has been adapted twice into Hollywood films. The first, A Kiss Before Dying, was a 1956 film starring Robert Wagner as Bud Corliss, Virginia Leith as Ellen Kingship, Joanne Woodward as Dorothy ('Dorie') Kingship, and Mary Astor as Mrs. Corliss. The film was directed by Gerd Oswald and, except for eliminating the third sister, Marion, he followed the novel's plot fairly closely.. The second adaptation, A Kiss Before Dying, drastically changed the story, and was produced in 1991. It was filmed as a neo-noir starring Matt Dillon as Jonathan Corliss, Sean Young as twins Ellen and Dorothy Carlsson, Diane Ladd as Mrs. Corliss, and Max von Sydow as Thor Carlsson. The movie was directed by James Dearden.. It was also an episode in the BBC 2 television series Story Parade. The script was co-written by Terry Nation. The Bollywood film Baazigar seems to be loosely inspired by the 1991 Hollywood remake rather than the original novel. Substantial changes were made to the protagonist, Ajay Sharma. In the film, Sharma's family is ruined at the hands of his father's employee, Madan Chopra. Thus, Sharma wishes to exact revenge by stealing Chopra's company from him by wooing his two daughters. In this fashion, Sharma is more of an anti- hero than a pure villain, and the aspect of vengeance dominates much of the film. A Malayalam movie named \\"Moonnilonnu\\" released in 1997 was also based on this novel. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonilonnu Critical reception Horror author Stephen King called Levin‚Äôs first novel ‚Äúa gritty suspense story told with great √©lan.‚Äù He describes the novel as unique in the sense that a key element of the story‚Äîthe revelation that Bud Corliss (whose character remains unnamed through the first third portion of the novel) was Dorothy's murderer‚Äîtakes the reader by complete surprise.

It was then published as a book in 1936, and translated to English by the author in 1937. Most copies of the 1937 English edition were destroyed by German bombs during World War II; only a few copies remain. Nabokov published a second English translation in 1965; this is now the only English translation in print. Plot summary The narrator and protagonist of the story, Hermann Karlovich, a Russian of German descent and owner of a chocolate factory, meets a homeless man in the city of Prague, whom he believes is his doppelg√§nger. Even though Felix, the supposed doppelg√§nger, is seemingly unaware of their resemblance, Hermann insists that their likeness is most striking. Hermann is married to Lydia, a sometimes silly and forgetful wife (according to Hermann) who has a cousin named Ardalion. It is heavily hinted that Lydia and Ardalion are, in fact, lovers, although Hermann continually stresses how much Lydia loves him. On one occasion Hermann actually walks in on the pair, naked, but Hermann appears to be completely oblivious of the situation, perhaps deliberately so. After some time, Hermann shares with Felix a plan for both of them to profit off their shared likeness by having Felix briefly pretend to be Hermann. But after Felix is disguised as Hermann, Hermann kills Felix in order to collect the insurance money on Hermann on March 9. Hermann considers the presumably perfect murder plot to be a work of art rather than a scheme to gain money. But as it turns out, there is no resemblance whatsoever between the two men, the murder is not 'perfect', and the murderer is about to be captured by the police in a small hotel in France, where he is hiding. Hermann who is writing the narrative switches to a diary mode at the very end just before his captivity, the last entry is on April 1. Background =Publication history= Nabokov began to compose Despair while he was living in Berlin beginning in July 1932 and managed to complete the first draft on September 10 of the same year. The year in which Nabokov was writing Despair was a turbulent one for Germany. In June 1932, the Reichstag had collapsed and Incumbent President President Paul von Hindenburg called for elections, leading to violence between the Nazis and Communists. It would not be long before the Nazi party would come into prominence and Hitler appointed as chancellor. This would only fuel Nabokov's hatred for totalitarian governments, and this disdain was incorporated somewhat into Despair (Hermann is pro-Communist) and more prominently later on in Invitation to a Beheading (1936), Nabokov's next novel. In 1935, Nabokov began to become increasingly intrigued with the English language and elected to translate his two most recently written novels at the time, Laughter in the Dark (1932) (first translated as Camera Obscura) and Despair. Nabokov remarked that translating Despair was his \\"first serious attempt... to use English for what may loosely termed an artistic purpose\\" and finished on December 29 later that year. Nabokov sent the manuscript to Hutchinson & Co. in April 1936 and although the company had initial reservations, eventually agreed to publish the book and the translation was checked by a Molly Carpenter-Lee, a student of Nabokov's friend Gleb Struve. The book was a complete flop commercially and Nabokov only earned ‚Ç¨40, a minuscule amount, even in the 1930s. The issue was that Hutchinson's only published cheap, \\"popular\\" novels, which Despair was not and thus, it was distributed to the wrong audience. Nabokov would later lament that Despair was \\"a rhinoceros in a world of hummingbirds\\". =Influences= Nabokov intended Hermann, and the novel in general, to be kind of a Dostoevskian (who is referred to as \\"Dusky and Dusty\\" in the novel) parody; this is even more evident as the original working title for the novel was to be Zapiski mistifikatora (Notes of a Hoaxer), akin to Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground. At one particular, Hermann even contemplates titling his narrative The Double, before he realizes it has been used, and opts for Despair instead. Nabokov infamously despised Dostoevsky's writing, with its excessive soul-searching and glorification of criminals and prostitutes and this is reflected in Despair and Hermann, who carries certain similarities to Raskolnikov, who had also planned a perfect murder in Crime and Punishment. Additionally, the book is rich in intertextual connections to other authors such as Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Oscar Wilde, and Conan Doyle.Aleksandr Dolinin. The Caning of Modernist Profaners: Parody in Despair , retrieved 04-12-2008 Criticism =Reception= Despair is generally acclaimed as one of Nabokov's better Russian novels, along with Invitation to a Beheading and The Gift (1938), and has a reasonable volume of literary criticism. British author Martin Amis ranked it second on his list of best Nabokov novels, with it trailing only Lolita (1955).http://www.martinamisweb.com/pre_2006/amisrecs.htm However, Nabokov's biographer Brian Boyd seemed to have ambivalent feelings toward Despair, noting that although \\"Nabokov's sheer intelligence crackles in every line... the book's style... seems sadly lacking in its structure.... It never quite convinces, and page after page that would make one tingle with excitement in another context can here only intermittently overcome one's remoteness from a story whose central premise fails to merit the suspension of disbelief\\". =Analysis= Despair is the second Nabokov novel to feature unreliable narration from a first-person point of view, the first being The Eye with the character Smurov. However, The Eye was more of an experiment condensed in a hundred-page novella, whereas Despair takes the unreliable first-person narrator to its fully fledged form, rivaling Humbert Humbert from Lolita, and Hermann is in a sense, Humbert's Russian cousin. Nabokov comments on this in the Foreword to the later edition of Despair, where he remarks that \\"Hermann and Humbert are alike only in the sense that two dragons painted by the same artist at different periods of his life resemble each other. Both are neurotic scoundrels, yet there is a green lane in Paradise where Humbert is permitted to wander at dusk once a year; but Hell shall never parole Hermann\\". To put it simply, the reader can never be positive if Hermann is accurately narrating the events because he tends to conflate his own skills and talents while ignoring reality around him. Additionally, Despair is also a tale of false doubles, one of Nabokov's favorite themes. The very title of the novel announces this theme as French-speaking Nabokov chose a word (despair) which in French means 'some pairs', or simply 'pairs' (des paires). But it also means, so to speak, 'to undo a pair', to 'dis-pair', i.e. the process going on in the novel by which the pair Hermann thought did exist actually revealed itself false. In it, doubling seems to be only an obsession with physical resemblances. Almost all of Nabokov's fictions make ample use of doubling, duplication, and mirroring, such as in Pale Fire and Lolita. Vladislav Khodasevich had pointed out that Nabokov is obsessed with a single theme: \\"the nature of the creative process and the solitary, freak-life role into which a man with such imagination is inevitably cast..\\"Simon Karlinsky. Illusion, Reality, and Parody in Nabokov's Plays.

It celebrates the life of the poet William Wordsworth, and looks after Dove Cottage in the Lake District village of Grasmere where Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy Wordsworth lived between 1799 and 1808. It also looks after the majority of the surrounding properties in the conservation area of Town End, and a collection of manuscripts, books and fine art relating to Wordsworth and other writers and artists of the Romantic period. In 2020 it introduced the brand name Wordsworth Grasmere.Website as at 7 April has header \\"Wordsworth Grasmere\\" and is \\"Copyright Wordsworth - Grasmere. Website as of 24 Feb 2020 has header \\"Dove Cottage & the Wordsworth Museum\\" and is \\"Copyright The Wordsworth Trust\\". The Wordsworth Trust's charitable purposes comprise preserving Dove Cottage and its environs, and advancing the public knowledge and enjoyment of the works of Wordsworth and the Romantic period. The Wordsworth Trust is a member of the Cumbria Museum Consortium, along with Lakeland Arts and the Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery Trust. In 2012-2015 and 2015-2018 this consortium was one of the 21 museums or consortia (16 in the earlier period) to be funded by Arts Council England as \\"Major Partner Museums\\". The Trust's first director was Dr Robert Woof CBE. Its current director is Michael McGregor. Its chairman is Professor Sir Drummond Bone. Its president is Chris Smith. Origins The Wordsworth Trust was founded (as the Dove Cottage Trust) in December 1891. Its creation followed a successful appeal for funds to purchase Dove Cottage, \\"for the eternal possession of those who love English poetry all over the world\\". Dove Cottage itself opened to visitors on 27 July 1891. The appeal to purchase Dove Cottage was led by Stopford Brooke; the Wordsworth Trust's other founding trustees included Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, Professor William Knight, The Rt Rev John Wordsworth and the Duke of Argyll. Their model was Shakespeare's birthplace in Stratford- upon-Avon, which had been purchased for the nation in 1847, but part of their motivation was also \\"the associations, personal, literary and moral, which gather around this cottage\\". As well as Dorothy Wordsworth, these associations included Thomas De Quincey (who himself had the tenancy of Dove Cottage between 1809 and 1835), Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, Sir Walter Scott, Sir Humphry Davy and Sir George Beaumont. Collection The Wordsworth Trust‚Äôs collection contains over 90% of Wordsworth‚Äôs verse manuscripts, and the largest collection of working papers, letters and other manuscript material relating to Wordsworth and his family anywhere in the world. It includes each of the 23 surviving manuscript versions of The Prelude, and all of the surviving notebooks in which Dorothy Wordsworth recorded their life at Dove Cottage, now published as the Grasmere Journal. The collection also includes Lake District drawings and other works by artists including David Cox, Joseph Farington, Joseph Wright of Derby, Thomas Girtin, Francis Towne, James Gillray and J.M.W. Turner. The Wordsworth Trust began assembling a collection of manuscripts, books and other items for visiting students almost as soon as it was founded, but its collection significantly increased in size in 1935 when it received the Wordsworth family papers by bequest from Gordon Graham Wordsworth, Wordsworth‚Äôs last surviving grandson. In the same year it converted a neighbouring barn into a museum, so that some of this material could be displayed. The museum was officially opened by John Masefield. In 1981 this was replaced by the current Wordsworth Museum, which is in a converted coachhouse immediately to the north of Dove Cottage. The former barn now houses the Wordsworth Trust's administration. In 2005 the collection was re-housed in the Jerwood Centre at the Wordsworth Trust, a purpose-built repository with research facilities adjacent to the Wordsworth Museum. The Jerwood Centre was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (since renamed the National Lottery Heritage Fund), the North West Regional Development Agency, the Jerwood Foundation and the European Regional Development Fund, and it was officially opened by Seamus Heaney on 2 June 2005. Activities The Wordsworth Trust's activities include staging exhibitions in the Wordsworth Museum, providing workshops and courses for schools and colleges, providing activities in local communities, and presenting a programme of talks, poetry readings and other events. The Wordsworth Trust also provides paid traineeships and internships, which provides experience of working in a museum / heritage environment and opportunities to gain some of the skills needed for a career in that field. In April 2018, the National Lottery Heritage Fund announced a ¬£4.1 million grant to improve the Wordsworth Museum and improve access for visitors to Dove Cottage. In March 2018, the UK Government announced that Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership had secured funding to enhance visitor attractions in the Lake District including Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum as part of the Northern Powerhouse project. The reopening of Dove Cottage, using the new brand Wordsworth Grasmere, was postponed from 7 April 2020, the 250th anniversary of Wordsworth's birth, to 15 August 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Spellcross: The Last Battle (Spellcross: Posledn√≠ bitva in Czech; Spellcross: Ostatnia bitwa in Polish) is a turn-based DOS strategy game for the PC, developed by a slovak company Cauldron HQ and published by Sales Curve Interactive in 1997/1998. For a variety of reasons (notably, a relatively nonexistent marketing budget and the emergence of games dominated by the demands of 3D-graphics cards), unfortunately for its designers, the game had little mass appeal, sold poorly, and has remained obscure. In Spellcross, a contemporary Earth military fights for survival against an extradimensional invasion of orcs, undead, harpies and other fantastical creatures. The game only features a single-player mode, split into tactical battles and a strategic planning mode. The former is the actual combat, each unit has action points, which can be used to commit actions such as attack or move, or reserved for opportunity fire or movement. Resource and troop management, research, maps, territory acquisition and counter-attacks tie the scenarios together in a rudimentary narrative. The newer English version differs from the older Czech version. Some graphics and animations have been improved, the mission design has been tweaked and some of them joined. The English version includes a tutorial and cheat codes. The English version has only two difficulty settings, while the Czech version has three. The story line pits the alliance against the forces of darkness, the game begins with Alexander(you) a colonel in the alliance forces who has become trapped behind enemy lines with a few squads of men, fighting your way through the forces of darkness you meet with the rest of the alliance and are brought to your first mission. The computer plays against you as the gate keepers or under lords who have unleashed a terrible onslaught on the earth torturing and killing many of the population they have conquered in sacrificial magic experiments. The story unfolds that they are attempting to awaken a sleeping titan within the earth's core. The forces of darkness use portals and gates to different dimensions to bring hordes of demonic creatures into the world.

Its name comes from the literal translation of the Mapuche term Curu Leuvu, although the water is more green than black. Formerly, it was also known as \\"river of the willows\\" because of the big number of weeping willows that grow along the bank. It's 635 km in length. It originates from the junction of the Limay River and Neuqu√©n River at the border with the Neuqu√©n Province, and flows southeast to the Atlantic Ocean at , near El C√≥ndor beach resort some downstream from Viedma, R√≠o Negro province's capital. The river allows the R√≠o Negro province to produce 65% of the pears and apples of Argentina. Besides irrigation, the river is also source of hydroelectricity with small dams on its course. The river served as natural demarcation between \\"civilization\\" and the aboriginal territories during the Conquest of the Desert of late 19th century. Valleys Spectacular meander scars, oxbow lakes and abandoned meanders in the broad flood plain of the R√≠o Negro near Colonia Josefa. 2010 photo from ISS The river is divided into three parts: The Alto Valle (High Valley) near the beginning of the river, Valle Medio (Medium Valley) near Choele Choel, and Valle Inferior (Lower Valley) near its end. The river crosses the steppe plains of the province through a forest of around in the Alto Valle, and as wide as towards the Valle Inferior. In the dry plain it is possible to find seashells and pebble. =Alto Valle= The main cities in Alto Valle are: General Roca, Cipolletti, Cinco Saltos, followed by many others on the National Route #22. Together with San Carlos de Bariloche, this is the most prosperous part of the province. Most pear and apple plantations are at the Alto Valle, but many also at the Valle Medio. =Valle Medio= Next to Choele Choel is the Choele Choel Island, in which are Lamarque, Luis Beltr√°n and Pomona, all of them on National Route #250. Besides apple and pear cultivation, tomato is also an important crop, being Lamarque the National Capital of the Tomato. Outside the valley, on the more arid lands around town such as Chimpay and Darwin, some cattle is also raised. =Valle Inferior= Although the term is not as used term as the previous two, Valle Inferior refers to Viedma and all the cities on the province's coast. Fruit is also produced but is not a primary activity. Onion is cultivated as well as some cereals. Alfalfa and maize is cultivated both for human consumption and for feeding cattle, which is the most important activity. Name In spite of its name of Negro (\\"black\\") the colour is more greenish than black. Nevertheless, the name is the literal translation of its aboriginal Mapuche name of Cur√∫ Leuv√∫.

This temple is a classical example of the architectural style of Kerala and has one monumental tower on each of the four sides in addition to a kuttambalam. Mural paintings depicting various scenes from the Mahabharata can be seen inside the temple. The shrines and the Kuttambalam display vignettes carved in wood. The temple, along with the mural paintings, has been declared as a National Monument by India under the AMASR Act. According to popular local lore, this is the first temple built by Parasurama, the sixth avatara of Vishnu. Thekkinkadu Maidan, encircling the Vadakkunnathan Temple, is the main venue of the renowned Thrissur Pooram festival. In the year 2012 the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has recommended 14 sites, including Vadakkumnathan Temple and palaces, from Kerala to include in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The temple is also the first one among the 108 Shiva Temples in ancient Kerala, established by Parasurama. Legend Legends regarding the origins of the Vadakkumnathan Temple are briefly narrated in the Brahmanda Purana and these legends are referenced in some other works as well. Though these accounts differ with respect to certain details, they are all in agreement regarding the central theme that the temple was founded by Parashurama. According to lore, Parashurama exterminated Kshatriyas in twenty-one cycles. In order to cleanse himself of the negative karma of these deeds he performed a yajna at the end of which he gave away all the land to Brahmins as dakshina. He wanted to retire to a new land to perform meditative penance (tapasya) and thus requested the Lord of the oceans Varuna to bring forth a new piece of land from the waters. The famous Sri Mula Sthana where, for some time, the linga of Shiva remained. Later, the ruler of Kochi Kingdom decided to shift the linga to a more convenient place and enclose it in a good temple. According to another version, some sages approached him at the end of the yajna and requested him to give them some secluded land. Parashurama then requested Varuna on their behalf. Varuna gave him a winnow (surpa) and asked him to hurl it into the sea; as he did so, a large area of land was brought from the sea; this region of land that arose from the sea become Kerala. It was then known by the name \\"Surparaka\\", from the word, \\"Surpa\\" meaning winnow. According to some other accounts, Varuna asked Parashurama to hurl his axe into the sea. Parashurama now wanted to consecrate this new land. So he went to Mount Kailasa to his guru, Lord Shiva and requested him to take abode in Kerala and thereby bless the region. Shri Shiva accompanied by his wife Parvati, his sons Ganesha and Subrahmanya and his parashadas went along with Parashurama, to oblige his disciple. Shiva stopped at a spot, which is now Thrissur, for his seat. Later he and his party disappeared and Parashurama saw a bright and radiant Shiva lingam (non-anthropomorphic icon of Shiva) at the foot of a huge banyan tree. This place where Shiva manifested his presence as a lingam is known in Sanskrit as the Sri Moola Sthana. For sometime, the lingam remained at Sri Moola Sthana at the foot of a huge banyan tree. The ruler of Cochin Kingdom then decided to shift the lingam to a more appropriate place and construct a temple around it. Arrangements were soon made for the new installation. But there was an initial difficulty. The lingam could not be removed without cutting off a large part of the banyan tree. This created the risk of damaging the lingam due to falling branches. As the ruler and the others remained confounded, the Yogatirippadu came forward with a solution. He lay over the lingam so as to cover it completely with his body and asked the men to cut the tree. The cutting began and to everyone's astonishment, not a single branch of the tree fell anywhere near the deity. The deity was moved according to prescribed rituals and installed in the new place where it remains to this day. Subsequently, a temple was built around the deity, according to the rules specified in the Shastras. History Map of City of Thrissur with Vadakkunnathan Temple prepared by John Gould in 1816 The temple was built at the time of Perumthachan from Parayi petta panthirukulam. It is said that Perumthachan lived during the second century; so the Koothambalam may be more than 1,600 years old. According to Malayalam historian V. V. K. Valath, the temple was a pre-Dravidian Kavu (shrine). In the early days, Paramekkavu Bhagavathi was also situated inside the Vadakkunnathan temple. Subsequently, a new temple was built outside and the idol of the goddess was moved to that location. For comparison, Koodalmanikyam Temple, Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple and Ammathiruvadi Temple, Urakam are older than the Vadakkunnathan temple, according to temple documents. Some suggest that there have also been influences from Buddhist and Jain temples. =Yogiatiripppads= The Nambudiris who were entrusted with looking after temple affairs were called Yogiatiripppads. When Nambudiris gained control of the region, the temple also came under their domain. The Yogiatiripppads were elected from Thrissur desam. Prior to Sakthan Thampuran's reign, the Yogiatiripppad system declined. Later, the Maharaja of Cochin gained presiding authority over the temple. =Adi Shankara= Adi Shankara is believed to have been born (788 AD) to Shivaguru and Aryamba of Kalady consequent to their prayers to lord Vadakkumnathan, as amsavatara of Shiva. The couple devoutly prayed for 41 days at the temple. Legend has it that Shiva appeared to the couple in their dreams and offered them a choice. They could have either a mediocre son who would live a long life or an extraordinary son who would die early. Both Shivaguru and Aryamba chose the latter. In honour of Shiva, they named their son Shankara. According to legend, Adi Shankara attained videha mukti (\\"freedom from embodiment\\") at the Vadakkunnathan temple. One narrative as expounded by the Keraliya Shankaravijaya, identifies the temple as his place of death. He also established four Mutts at Thrissur, famously known as Edayil Madhom, Naduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom and Vadakke Madhom A rare picture of main entrance of Vadakkunnathan Temple taken in 1913 seen from Swaraj Round from Illustrated Guide to the South Indian Railway, printed by Hoe and Coat the 'Premier Press'. =Invasion of Tipu Sultan= During the invasion of Tipu Sultan, the temple was not attacked by Tipu's Army. Even though Tipu Sultan destroyed many temples in Thrissur district at that time, he never touched Vadakkunnathan Temple. According to historical accounts, when Tipu Sultan was marching towards the Travancore lines, known locally as Nedumkotta, he had a short stay at Thrissur city from 14 to 29 December 1789. In order to feed his Army, he had borrowed cooking vessels from Vadukanthan Temple. Before leaving Thrissur city, he not only returned the vessels, but presented the temple with a large bronze lamp. =Zamorin of Calicut= During 1750 to 1762, the temple affairs were conducted by Zamorin of Calicut who attacked Thrissur city and took control of the temple and the city. In 1762 with the help of Kingdom of Travancore, Maharaja of Cochin regained control over Thrissur city and the temple. =Sakthan Thampuran= When Sakthan Thampuran (1751‚Äì1805), ascended the throne of Kingdom of Cochin, he changed the capital of Kingdom of Cochin from Thripunithura to Thrissur city as the King had a personal relationship with Vadakkunnathan Temple. He later cleared the teak forest around the temple and introduced the famous Thrissur Pooram festival. The King's personal interest in the temple also changed the fortune of the city. Structure The temple is situated on an elevated hillock in the centre of Thrissur City and is surrounded by a massive stone wall enclosing an area of nearly . Inside this fortification, there are four gopurams facing four cardinal directions. Between the inner temple and the outer walls, there is a spacious compound, the entrance to which is through gopurams. Of these, the gopurams on the south and north are not open to the public. The public enter either through the east or west gopuram. The inner temple is separated from the outer temple by a broad circular granite wall enclosing a broad corridor called Chuttambalam. Entrance into the inner temple is through a passage through the corridor. Deities Interior of Vadakkunnathan Temple and in the right side is the world-famous Koothambalam. The main deity of this temple, Lord Shiva, is worshipped in the form of a huge lingam, which is covered by a mound of ghee, formed by the daily abhishekam (ablution) with ghee over the years. A devotee looking into the sanctum can now see only a mound of ghee embellished with thirteen cascading crescents of gold and three serpent hoods on top. According to traditional belief, this represents the snow-clad Mount Kailash, the abode of Shiva. This is the only temple where the lingam is not visible. It is said that the ghee offered here for centuries does not have any foul odour and it does not melt even during summer. In the outer temple, there are shrines for Krishna (Gosala Krishna; or Gopala Krishna; Krishna as a cowherd), Shiva's bull vahana (vehicle) Nandikeswara, Parashurama, Simhodara, Ayyappa (Shiva's son, especially venerated in Kerala), Vettekkaran (Shiva as a hunter), Serpent deities and Adi Shankara. Outside the main temple, there are shrines for Lord Subrahmanya and Lord Ganapathi. Located on the verandah of the Nalambalam is a large white bull Nandikeswara. It is in the northern side that the main sanctum, a circular structure with Shiva facing west and behind him, Parvati facing east, denoting their combined form Ardhanarishvara, is made. The two- storied rectangular shrine of the god Rama facing west is located in the south. Between these two sanctums (srikovils) stands a third one, circular and double-storied in shape, which is dedicated to Shankaranarayana, the combined form of Shiva and Vishnu, facing west. There are mukhamandapams (halls) in front of all the three central shrines. Kerala-History The two important murals in the temple, Vasukisayana and Nrithanatha (Nataraja), are worshipped regularly. Ganesha shrine is positioned facing the temple kitchen. The offering of Appam (sweetened rice cake fried in ghee) to him is one of the most important offerings at the temple. Propitiating him here is believed to be a path to prosperity and wealth. Architecture Layout of Sanctum sanctorums in Vadakkumnatha Temple =Murals= The temple is famous for the rarity of the temple murals, of which the Vasukishayana and Nrithanatha murals are of great importance and are worshipped daily. The temple also houses a museum of ancient wall paintings, wood carvings and art pieces of ancient times. A study done by Archaeological Survey of India on two paintings in the temple has revealed that it is 350 years old. These two rare paintings were a reclining Shiva and a Nataraja with 20 arms. =Koothambalam= The temple theatre, known as Koothambalam, has four magnificent gateways called Gopurams and the lofty masonry wall around the temple quadrangle are imposing pieces of craftsmanship and skill. The Koothambalam is used for staging Koothu, Nangyar Koothu and Koodiyattam, an ancient ritualistic art forms of Central Kerala. According to folk lore, before the new Koothambalam was built, there used to be an old and dilapidated structure. The then Diwan T. Sankunni Menon ordered to demolish the structure and construct a new Koothambalam. He gave this task to Velanezhy Nambudiri, a famous Thachushasthranjan or master craftsman. He prepared a mental sketch and built a beautiful Koothambalam there. Velanezhy Illom is in Venganellur Gramam, Chelakkara town. Festivals =Maha Shivaratri= Maha Shivaratri is the main festival which is celebrated in the temple. Cultural and musical programmes are held in the temple premises. Around one lakh temple lamps (hundred thousand)are lighted in the festival. The idol of Vadakkumnatha is not taken out for procession. On this day, there will he continuous abhishekam with ghee and tender coconut. The temple is not closed in the night, and there will be special poojas with abhishekam on the day. Vadakkumnathan Temple's Thekke Gopura Vathil lighted up during the Maha Shivaratri festival. =Aanayoottu= The Aanayoottu of feeding of elephants, is the second biggest festival held in the temple. The devotees refer to elephants as Lord Ganesh's incarnation. The festival falls on the first day of the month of Karkkidakam (timed against the Malayalam calendar), which coincides with the month of July. It has been the regular annual practice at the temple for the last 20 years to conduct a large-scale Ashta Dravya Maha Ganapathy Havana and Aanayoottu on the first day of the Karkidakom month of the Malayalam calendar. It involves a number of unadorned elephants being positioned amid a multitude of people for being worshipped and fed. A large number of people throng the temple to feed the elephants. Gajapooja also is conducted once every four years. =Thrissur Pooram= Thrissur Pooram is called the mother of all Poorams in Kerala. In Malayalam it's called \\"poorangalude pooram\\". This is conducted in the Malayalam month of Medam. The deities from Parmekavu and Thiruvambady temple along with other small poorams come engage in festivities in front of Vadakkumanathan. It's a 36 long hour festival which attracts thousands of enthusiasts from all over the state as well as visitors from other regions and abroad. The main attractions of Pooram are Madathilavaravu panchavadhyam, Elanjithara melam, Kudamattam and Vedikettu. The festival is a visual feast for all those who enjoy it. Names Shiva here is more popularly known as Vadakkunnathan (Sanskrit Vrishabhachala -Tamil Vidaikunrunathan Vidai - Vrishabha, kunru - chala ). The Sanskrit Vrishabha refers to Nandi represented as a mound or hill. The town of Thrissur thus also derives a name Vrishabhadripuram. The Malayalam Vadakkumnathan literally translated, means The Lord of the North, who resides in Kailasam (The Himalayas) which is in the northern side of India. Temple timings The temple opens daily at 04:00 AM, closes at 10:00 AM, reopens at 04:30 PM and closes at 8.20 PM after 'Trippuka', the last rite of the day. Three poojas are performed daily. No deities are taken outwards to procession. Everytime the nada opens, there is niyamavedi (timing fire).

It is a small, partially vegetated plateau composed of 150-million-year-old Middle Jurassic limestone. With an average annual rainfall of about , the underlying rocks are susceptible to erosion, thereby producing caves and underground rivers‚Äîa karst topography. The rugged relief and the dense vegetation have helped protect the region from human intrusion. Ankarana Plateau, showing tsingy. The plateau slopes gently to the east, but on the west it ends abruptly in the \\"Wall of Ankarana\\", a sheer cliff that extends north to south, and rises as high as . To the south, the limestone mass breaks up into separate spires known as tower karst. In the center of the plateau, seismic activity and eons of rainfall have dissolved the limestone away in deep gorges, and sometimes redeposited it in ribbons of flowstone. In places where the calcific upper layers have been completely eroded, the harder base rock has been etched into channels and ridges known as tsingy. The largest sinkhole in the Ankarana karst region, Mangily sinkhole, measures up to across and deep with a volume of . The area is sacred to the Antankarana people, who have historically taken refuge from encroaching enemy armies in its caves and other natural rock shelters. Exploration Beginning in the 1960s, expatriate Frenchman Jean Duflos (who married locally and changed his name to Jean Radofilao) did a huge amount of exploration of the cave systems and subterranean rivers of the Massif, much of it on his own or with visiting speleologists. A total of about of cave passages within the massif have been mapped. One of the most accessible caves, La Grotte d'Andrafiabe, alone comprises at least of horizontal passages. Indeed the Massif contains the longest cave systems in Madagascar, and probably in the whole of Africa.http://www-sop.inria.fr/agos/sis/DB/countries.html Fauna A male Crowned lemur photographed at the Ankarana Special Reserve Expeditions that first began cataloguing the animals and plants of the Special Reserve created around the Ankarana Massif in the 1980s are described in Dr Jane Wilson- Howarth's travel narrative Lemurs of the Lost World and in the scientific press. Discoveries included unexpected sub-fossil remains of large extinct lemurs and surviving but previously undescribed species of blind fish, shrimps and other invertebrates. Several expedition members contributed photos to an illustrated introductory guide to Madagascar which features the Crocodile Caves. During the 1986 expedition, Phil Chapman and Jean-Elie Randriamasy collated a bird list for the reserve and recorded 65 species from 32 families representing nearly a third of all bird species that breed in Madagascar. They also noted one interesting aspect of behaviour. They reported that there was an unusual strategy used by many of the small insect-eating songbirds. Species such as the Paradise Flycatcher (Terpsiphone mutata), the Common Jery (Neomixis tenella), the Greenbuls (Phyllastrephus zosterops and P. madagascariensis), the Bulbul (Hypsipetes madagascariensis), the Sunbird (Nectarina souimanga) and the Vagas (Lepopterus madagascarinus and Xenopirostris polleni) foraged together in mixed bands. Within each band different species seemed to specialise in where and how they searched out their insect prey. Some species concentrated on the trunk and branches of trees, some on slender boughs, others searched beneath the leaves. By acting together in this way they probably increased foraging efficiency as each species could catch others‚Äô escaped prey. They were also safer from attack by predators, as the group as a whole was more likely to spot approaching danger. The Ankarana Reserve is an important refuge for significant populations of the crowned lemur (Eulemur coronatus)https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Crowned_Lemur#p00dtq1q, Sanford's brown lemur (Eulemur sanfordi) and other mammal species. The following lemurs are also recorded from the area: northern sportive lemur (Lepilemur septentrionalis), brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus), fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogalus medius), fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer), eastern woolly lemur (Avahi laniger), Perrier's sifaka (Propithicus diadema perrieri), aye- aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) and the western lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus occidentalis). In addition subfossils of the following lemurs have been found at Ankarana: greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus), indri (Indri indri), the sloth lemurs (Babakotia radofilai), Mesopropithicus dolichobrachion and Palaeopropithicus cf ingens plus Pachylemur sp., the huge Megaladapis cf madagascariensis/grandidieri, and the baboon lemur Archaeolemur sp. The Reserve also has several microendemic species of reptile and amphibian, including Madagascarophis lolo, Geckolepis megalepis, Tsingymantis antitra (a monotypic frog genus restricted just to Ankarana), Phelsuma roesleri, and Stumpffia be.

Charles Voysey studied at the Architectural Association School and the UCL Bartlett School of Architecture. Between 1909 and 1912 he was articled to Horace Field and assistant to John James Burnet and to Horace Farquharson, before starting his own practice in 1912.The Times, obituary 15th April 1981 John Brandon-Jones worked for Cowles-Voysey, became a partner in the business and finally took over the firm.scottisharchitects.org.uk Voysey's father, the Arts and Crafts movement architect and designer C.F.A. Voysey (1857-1941), was one of the first architects to use concrete unadorned, rather than disguised as a traditional building material. Marriage, Change of Surname and Wife‚Äôs Family In 1912, Charles married Dorothea Denise Cowles (1885-1980) and amended his surname to Cowles-Voysey. Dorothea was great-great-granddaughter of George Cowles (1737-1811) a Gloucester-born, London-based Georgian goldsmith of repute, who already in the 1760s produced items in the simpler lines of the coming new classical style, moving away from baroque and rococo. George married the niece of his former Master Samuel Courtauld, Judith Jacob (1741-1775), so Dorothea Cowles was also descended from two further Georgian goldsmiths: George Cowles‚Äô father-in-law Jean/John Jacob (1709-1787), and Jean Jacob‚Äôs father-in-law Augustin Courtauld (1686-1751), both Huguenot goldsmiths based in Westminster. Nearer the present, Dorothea was the younger daughter of Denis Jacob Cowles (1854-1941), who had won a scholarship to St John‚Äôs College, Oxford, rowed for Oxford in the Boat Races of 1877 (declared dead heat) and 1878 (Oxford won), and by the time of Dorothea‚Äôs marriage, was a Suffolk Magistrate, twice Chairman of the local Urban Council, and Principal of Manor House School in Felixstowe, which specialised in pupils for the Army Examinations. Denis Jacob Cowles‚Äô Huguenot ancestry was the source of the continuing French spelling down the generations of his name Denis with one ‚Äòn‚Äô and of his daughter Dorothea‚Äôs middle name of Denise. Charles and Dorothea had no children. Kingsley Hall In 1927 Cowles-Voysey was asked to design Kingsley Hall which included a main hall also used for worship, and five rooftop cells for community volunteers. The style of the father passed to the son in the design of Children's House and Kingsley Hall. This came after many hours soulful discussions with Muriel Lester about how to bring the very best to the poor of the East End. Indeed, Kingsley Hall was built to bring Heaven to Earth and originally had six small monastic type cells on the top floor where volunteers would stay and dedicate their days to community work.

It is long, ArcExplorer GIS data viewer. flowing from east to west through the Santa Ynez Valley, reaching the Pacific Ocean at Surf, near Vandenberg Air Force Base and the city of Lompoc. The river drains the north slope of the Santa Ynez Mountains, the south slope of the San Rafael Mountains, as well as much of the southern half of Santa Barbara County. Its drainage basin is in area. ArcExplorer GIS data viewer. The river's flow is highly variable. It usually dries up almost completely in the summer, but can become a raging torrent in the winter. The river has three dams which can impound a total of of water in wet years. History The river was first named by the Spanish Portol√† expedition, first European land exploration of Alta California, which camped near the river mouth on August 30, 1769. Apparently unable to agree on a single name, expedition diarists recorded three. Engineer Miguel Costanso wrote \\"R√≠o Grande de San Verardo\\". Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted two additional names; \\"San Bernardo\\" and \\"Santa Rosa\\". None of the three names remain attached to any feature in the area. Instead, the river and mountains took the name of Mission Santa In√©s (also spelled \\"Yn√©s\\" or \\"Yn√©z\\" in New Spain), which was established in 1804 (named for Saint Agnes of Rome, Virgin and Martyr). According to the USGS, variant and historical names of the Santa Ynez River include La Purisima River, Rio De La Purisima, Rio De Calaguasa, Rio Santa Rosa, Rio De Santa Ines, and Rio De Santa Ynes. Course The Santa Ynez River originates in Los Padres National Forest, on the northern slope of the Santa Ynez Mountains near Divide Peak and the Ventura County border. The river flows west, collecting various headwater tributaries. The Upper Santa Ynez Campground is located near the river's source. After flowing through Billiard Flats the river enters Jameson Lake, the reservoir impounded by Juncal Dam. Below the dam, Alder Creek joins the Santa Ynez River from the south. At times water from Alder Creek is diverted into Jameson Lake via a tunnel. West end of Jameson Lake, 2012 Lake Cachuma, a reservoir on the Santa Ynez River. The river is visible at the far bottom of the image. Continuing its generally westward course, the Santa Ynez flows by several campgrounds and canyons, including Blue Canyon. Mono Creek joins from the north just as the Santa Ynez flows into Gibraltar Reservoir, impounded by Gibraltar Dam. Below this dam the river passes several campgrounds as well as facilities such as the Los Prietos Ranger Station. Paradise Road runs along the river. Continuing west, the river passes Fremont Campground near the mouth of Red Rock Canyon. West of Red Rock Canyon the river leaves Los Padres National Forest and its valley widens considerably. Kelly Creek joins from the south, draining Los Laureles Canyon and Cold Spring Canyon. State Route 154, which crosses the Santa Ynez Mountains via San Marcos Pass, enters the Santa Ynez River valley at this point and follows the river for several miles to the west. Hot Spring Canyon joins from the south just before the Santa Ynez River enters Lake Cachuma. Lake Cachuma, the largest reservoir on the river, is approximately five miles in length. Several tributaries join the Santa Ynez River in Lake Cachuma, including Santa Cruz Creek and Cachuma Creek from the north and a number of smaller streams from the south. The lake area is designated as the Lake Cachuma Recreation Area. Cachuma County Park, near Tequepis Point, provides lake access. Water from the lake is diverted into the Tecolote Tunnel, which passes south under the mountains to the Santa Barbara area. Below Lake Cachuma, the Santa Ynez River continues its westward course. Its valley continues to widen and contains ranches and other development. The river passes by the town of Santa Ynez and the cities of Solvang and Buellton. In Buellton the river is crossed by U.S. Route 101. Several tributaries join the river in this area, including Quiota Creek, Alisal Creek, and Nojoqui Creek and Falls from the south, and Santa Agueda Creek, Zanja de Cota Creek, Alamo Pintado Creek and Zaca Creek from the north. West of Buellton the Santa Ynez River flows between the Santa Rita Hills and Purisima Hills to the north and the Santa Rosa Hills to the south. It is joined by Santa Rosa Creek from the north and Salsipuedes Creek from the south. Just west of Salsipuedes Creek the Santa Ynez River flows past the largest city in the valley, Lompoc. A few miles west of Lompoc the river reaches the Pacific Ocean at a location known as Surf, where there is a beach and an Amtrak station. While there is public access to Surf and the mouth of the Santa Ynez River, most of the land between Lompoc and the ocean is part of Vandenberg Air Force Base.Course info from various sources including Topozone.com and ; and: =Discharge= The USGS operates several stream gages along the Santa Ynez river.

There are three reservoirs on the river, the largest of which is Lake Cachuma, with a capacity of . Bradbury Dam, which forms the lake, was built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Water from Lake Cachuma is diverted into the Tecolote Tunnel, which passes south under the Santa Ynez Mountains. The tunnel supplies water to the city of Santa Barbara (which uses it for drinking water), the Goleta Water District, the Carpinteria Valley Water District, and the Montecito Water District. Water from Lake Cachuma is released into the Santa Ynez River below Bradbury Dam in order to satisfy downstream water rights.Water Resources Data‚ÄîCalifornia, Water Year 2004, Volume 1 The other two reservoirs are Gibraltar Reservoir, impounded by Gibraltar Dam, and Jameson Lake, impounded by Juncal Dam. Gibraltar Reservoir supplies water to the City of Santa Barbara via the Santa Barbara Water Tunnel under the Santa Ynez Mountains. Jameson Lake supplies water to the Montecito Water District via another tunnel under the Santa Ynez Mountains. In 2004 the diversions amounted to from Gibraltar Reservoir, and from Jameson Lake. A 2010 report on the restoration potential of the Santa Ynez River estuary, found \\"Over the last 150 years human activities, especially dam construction, have significantly affected river flows in the entire watershed. The most important changes to wetland habitats and ecologic processes have resulted from changed river inflows and sediment loads from the watershed combined with changing hydraulic and geomorphic effects from bridge causeways. These process changes have led to alteration of sedimentation and erosion patterns and converted wetland habitats to upland. Upstream dam construction now controls 47% of the watershed‚Äôs annual runoff, has reduced the frequency and duration of lagoon breaching as well as the magnitude and frequency of flood events that have the most important role in sustaining and renewing a mosaic of wetland and estuarine habitats within the estuary and lower river.\\" Ecology Early Western travelers fording the Santa Ynez River during the turn of the 20th century. In the 1940s the Santa Ynez River was thought to have the largest run of steelhead (Oncorhyncus mykiss irideus) south of San Francisco Bay. Prior to the completion of Cachuma Dam in 1953, the steelhead run on the Santa Ynez River was estimated to be as high as 25,000 adults. Three decades earlier, in 1920, the Gibraltar Dam was built and blocked access to spawning in the upper watershed, so early twentieth century steelhead runs were likely much higher still. The National Marine Fisheries Service listed the Southern California steelhead Distinct Population Segment as endangered in 1997 due to a 99% decline in its population in the twentieth century. A wild rainbow trout population above the Cachuma Dam probably provides outgoing smolts which become steelhead trout in the ocean, however a low percentage of outgoing smolt survive the migration because of low to no flows or predation in the coastal estuary. Genetic analysis of the steelhead in the Santa Ynez River watershed has shown them to be of native and not hatchery stocks. The lower Santa Ynez River in the Lompoc area, and lower tributary Salsipuedes Creek has about a dozen California Golden beaver (Castor canadensis subauratus) dams, however in wet years steelhead can generally get around, over, or through beaver dams, and steelhead are common in rivers and streams where beaver are numerous. In addition, high winter flows disrupt the beaver dams and allow steelhead passage. The beavers may play a critical role for steelhead populations as their ponds replenish aquifers, allowing groundwater to recharge streams in dry summers, and provide perennial pools for oversummering trout smolt. In fact, salmonid abundance and fish size increases when beaver are present. Evidence that beaver were once extant in southern California coastal streams includes an adult male beaver skull collected by mammalogist Dr. John Hornung in May, 1906 \\"along the Sespe River in Ventura County\\" which is now housed in the Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. There is a Chumash pictograph of a beaver at Painted Rock in the nearby Cuyama River watershed. In addition the Barbare√±o and Venture√±o Chumash had a Beaver Dance. The Chumash word for beaver is Chipik, spelled \\"ƒç‚Äô«ùp«ùk‚Äô\\" in Barbare√±o and \\"t≈°«ù‚Äôp«ùk\\" in Venture√±o, and \\"ƒç‚Äô…®p…®k\\" in Inese√±o (Samala) (Timothy Henry personal communication 2011-01-23). Taken together, these facts support the hypothesis that beaver ranged throughout Santa Barbara County, California. Finally, Father Pedro Font, on the second de Anza Expedition in 1776, described the coastal Chumash women as wearing beaver capes. However, the Santa Ynez River beaver were likely trapped out until re-introduction in the 1940s by the California Department of Fish and Game. John Peabody Harrington reported beaver on Zanja de Cota Creek on or before 1900. The endangered Tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi) is also found in the creek's brackish coastal lagoon and several miles upstream in sections of stream impounded by beavers which provide ideal slow-moving water habitat for gobies.

Despite Wales and England being represented in all forms of International cricket by the England team, the Welsh cricket team continues to play short form cricket periodically. Early history From 1923 to 1930 Wales played 16 first-class matches, and had some success against touring teams, drawing with the New Zealanders in 1927 and beating the West Indians a year later, as well as losing by only ten runs to the South Africans in 1929. Sydney Barnes, by this time well into his fifties, took 49 first-class wickets for Wales, including 7‚Äì51 in the victory over the West Indians. ICC Trophy Wales' next significant appearances came in the 1979 ICC Trophy. As several ICC members did not enter the competition, Wales were invited without qualification. Playing in Group C, Wales had a reasonably successful tournament, opening with a win over the Netherlands in a rain-affected game at Enville. Jeffris Hopkins top scored with 71. They next played Israel and piled up a daunting 234/5, this time Hopkins opened the batting and again top scored with 92, Geoffrey Williams hit 67. Some effective bowling by Alan Geoghegan (3/23) limited Israel and Wales finished the match 91 runs ahead. The match against United States, was an exciting affair. Chasing a respectable total of 190, the Welsh were on target at 139/4 (Geoff Ellis making 56), but an unexpected and excellent spell of bowling from Kamran Rasheed (more usually a wicket-keeper) turned the game. He took 5‚Äì17 in his eight overs and Wales were dismissed for 182, just eight runs short. The game against Sri Lanka was abandoned without a ball being bowled. As a result, Wales finished equal first on 10 points in group C but lost out on a Semi-final spot to Sri Lanka due to their superior run rate. Hopkins finished with 168 runs to his name, joint 6th for the tournament and the highest of any player to exit at the group stage. Triple Crown Tournament Wales took part in the Triple Crown Tournament (British Isles Championship) between 1993 and 2001; this was an initiative to help develop cricket in British Isles involving Wales, Scotland, Ireland and various England amateur XIs. Wales hosted the event in 1996 and 2000 but never won the annual tournament in its nine years. As Scotland and Ireland became ICC members the tournament was discontinued and the two have since competed in the ICC's European Cricket Championship. As Wales is not an ICC member in its own right, the team cannot feature in the ICC competition meaning Wales has not played competitive international cricket since the discontinuation of the Triple Crown Tournament. Recent appearances From 2002 to 2004 Wales played a 50-over challenge match against England each June. In the first of these games they recorded a shock eight-wicket victory, with Steve James making 83 not out, though the other two games went to England. Wales' team consisted mostly of Welsh cricketers, although there were a scattering of non-Welsh Glamorgan players such as Michael Kasprowicz and Dean Cosker. In 1988, a Wales Minor Counties team under the control of the Welsh Cricket Association, the governing body for amateur cricket in Wales, made its first appearance in the Holt Cup, a one-day tournament for minor-county teams. Since then, the Wales MC side has appeared regularly in the NatWest Trophy (and its successor, the C&G; Trophy) as well as in the Minor Counties Championship, their most notable result probably the seven-wicket win over Denmark in the first round of the 2004 C&G; Trophy (which due to the vagaries of the schedule was actually played in August 2003). Status as standalone team Historically, the England team represented 'Great Britain' in international cricket, with Scottish or Welsh teams playing occasional matches. Scotland became an independent member of the ICC in 1994, having separated from the Test and County Cricket Board (the forerunner of the current England and Wales Cricket Board) two years earlier. Criticism has been made of the England and Wales Cricket Board using only the England name whilst utilising Welsh playersCampaign for a truly National Welsh Cricket Team such as Simon Jones and Geraint Jones. With Welsh players pursuing international careers exclusively with an England team, there have been a number of calls for Wales to become an independent member of the ICC, or for the ECB to provide more fixtures for a Welsh national team.\\"Should Wales have its own international cricket team, ask Assembly Members\\", Wales Online, 23 October 2013. Accessed 13 January 2014 However, both Cricket Wales and Glamorgan County Cricket Club have continually supported the ECB, with Glamorgan arguing for the financial benefits of the Welsh county within the English structure, and Cricket Wales stating they are \\"committed to continuing to play a major role within the ECB\\" The absence of a Welsh cricket team has seen a number of debates within the Welsh Senedd. In 2013 a debate saw both Conservative and Labour members lend their support to the establishment of an independent Welsh team. In 2015, a report produced by the Welsh National Assembly‚Äôs petitions committee, reflected the passionate debate around the issue. Bethan Jenkins, Plaid Cymru‚Äôs spokesperson on heritage, culture, sport and broadcasting, and a member of the petitions committee, argued that Wales should have its own international team and withdraw from the ECB. Jenkins noted that Ireland (with a population of 6.4 million) was an ICC member with 6,000 club players whereas Wales (with 3 million) had 7,500. Jenkins said: \\"Cricket Wales and Glamorgan CCC say the idea of a Welsh national cricket team is ‚Äòan emotive subject‚Äô, of course having a national team is emotive, you only have to look at the stands during any national game to see that. To suggest this as anything other than natural is a bit of a misleading argument.\\" In 2017, the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones called for the reintroduction of the Welsh one day team stating: \\"[It] is odd that we see Ireland and Scotland playing in international tournaments and not Wales.\\" Notable Welsh cricketers The following Welsh cricketers have played Test cricket for England: * Sydney Barnes: The legendary English fast-medium bowler, born in Staffordshire, made nine appearances for Wales from 1927 until 1930 (retiring at 57 years old). Barnes took 49 wickets for Wales in 1928, including seven for 51 and five for 67 in an eight wicket win over the touring West Indians. * Johnnie Clay: Clay played one Test match for England in 1935.Johnnie Clay * Robert Croft: Croft played international cricket for both England and Wales.

Jones's pace and mastery of reverse-swing carried him to 18 wickets at 21 in four Tests, before he was forced to sit out a nervy final match due to an ankle problem. * Tony Lewis: Lewis captained Glamorgan and England, and went on to become the face of BBC Television cricket coverage in the 1990s, and become president of the MCC.Tony Lewis * Austin Matthews: He played for Northamptonshire, Glamorgan and single Test for England.Austin Matthews * Hugh Morris: He played in three Tests for England in 1991. * Gilbert Parkhouse: He played in seven Tests for England in 1950, 1950‚Äì51 and 1959.Gilbert Parkhouse * Pat Pocock: He played in twenty Tests and one ODI for England from 1968 to 1985.Pat Pocock * Greg Thomas: He played in five Tests and three ODIs for England between 1986 and 1987.Greg Thomas * Maurice Turnbull: He played in nine Tests for England from 1930 to 1936.Maurice Turnbull * Cyril Walters: He had most of his success after leaving Glamorgan, as captain-secretary of Worcestershire.Cyril Walters * Steve Watkin: He played three Test matches in 1991 and 1993, and four One Day Internationals in 1993 and 1994.Steve Watkin * Allan Watkins: He played for England in fifteen Tests from 1948 to 1952.Allan Watkins * Wilf Wooller: Cricketer, rugby union footballer, cricket administrator and journalist, Wooller captained Glamorgan CCC for 14 years, was Secretary for thirty and President for six.Wilf Wooller See also * Welsh women's cricket team * England women's cricket team References External links *Cricket Wales *Welsh Cricket Association Category:Cricket in Wales Category:National cricket teams Category:Wales in international cricket Category:History of Welsh cricket C ","title":"Wales national cricket team"},{"id":"2626212","text":"Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) also known as solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 2 (SLC2A2) is a transmembrane carrier protein that enables protein facilitated glucose movement across cell membranes. It is the principal transporter for transfer of glucose between liver and blood Unlike GLUT4, it does not rely on insulin for facilitated diffusion. In humans, this protein is encoded by the SLC2A2 gene.  Tissue distribution  GLUT2 is found in cellular membranes of: * liver (Primary) * pancreatic Œ≤ cell (Primary in mice, tertiary in humans after GLUT1 and GLUT3) * hypothalamus (Not overly significant) * basolateral membrane of small intestine and apical GLUT2 is also suggested. * basolateral membrane of renal tubular cells  Function  GLUT2 has high capacity for glucose but low affinity (high Km, ca. 15-20 mM) and thus functions as part of the \\"glucose sensor\\" in the pancreatic Œ≤-cells of rodents, though in human Œ≤-cells the role of GLUT2 seems to be a minor one. It is a very efficient carrier for glucose. GLUT2 also carries glucosamine. When the glucose concentration in the lumen of the small intestine goes above 30 mM, such as occurs in the fed-state, GLUT2 is up-regulated at the brush border membrane, enhancing the capacity of glucose transport. Basolateral GLUT2 in enterocytes also aids in the transport of fructose into the bloodstream through glucose-dependent cotransport.  Clinical significance  Defects in the SLC2A2 gene are associated with a particular type of glycogen storage disease called Fanconi-Bickel syndrome. In drug-treated diabetic pregnancies in which glucose levels in the woman are uncontrolled, neural tube and cardiac defects in the early-developing brain, spine, and heart depend upon functional GLUT2 carriers, and defects in the GLUT2 gene have been shown to be protective against such defects in rats. However, whilst a lack of GLUT2 adaptability is negative, it is important to remember the fact that the main result of untreated gestational diabetes appears to cause babies to be of above-average size, which may well be an advantage that is managed very well with a healthy GLUT2 status. Maintaining a regulated osmotic balance of sugar concentration between the blood circulation and the interstitial spaces is critical in some cases of edema including cerebral edema. GLUT2 appears to be particularly important to osmoregulation, and preventing edema-induced stroke, transient ischemic attack or coma, especially when blood glucose concentration is above average. GLUT2 could reasonably be referred to as the \\"diabetic glucose transporter\\" or a \\"stress hyperglycemia glucose transporter.\\" SLC2A2 was associated with clinical stages and independently associated with overall survival in patients with HCC, and could be considered a new prognostic factor for HCC.

It is used to manage the flow in the River Dee as part of the River Dee regulation system which is designed to protect the water supply for North West England and north-east Wales, particularly Liverpool and its surrounding area. The northern half is in the community of Nantglyn and the southern half in Cerrigydrudion, with the village of Pentre-Llyn-Cymmer situated to the south of the lake. Construction and operation Construction began in 1973 and was completed in 1976. It has a capacity of 60 million m¬≥ and was first filled in 1979. With a surface area of around , it is the fourth largest lake in Wales, behind Llyn Tegid (Bala Lake), Llyn Trawsfynydd and Lake Vyrnwy. The lake has a perimeter of some . The catchment of the reservoir is very significantly over-reservoired. This means that the reservoir cannot fill from its own catchment within one annual hydrological cycle. When the reservoir level is drawn down, it can take several years for it to completely re-fill again. Llyn Brenig is therefore only used during drought conditions when the capacity of Llyn Celyn and Llyn Tegid are no longer predicted to be capable of maintaining the flow in the River Dee. Archaeology During construction of the lake, a number of Bronze Age artifacts were found, as was a camp used by Mesolithic hunter/gatherers. This has been dated by radiocarbon analysis of the charcoal from their fires to around 5700 BC. There are a number of archaeological trails around Llyn Brenig; the relics visible include a ring cairn (a Bronze Age burial mound), and several barrows. A visitor centre to the south of the lake displays a lot of archaeological information about the area before they turned the history section into a meeting room. Watersports A number of watersports take place on the lake, including sailing, fishing, canoeing and water zorbing. The only power craft allowed on the lake are those used by fishermen, Rangers' patrol boats and sailing club safety craft. In 1990 it was selected as the only Welsh reservoir used for the World Fly Fishing Championships.http://www.aboutbritain.com/LlynBrenigReservoirVisitorCentre.htm Wildlife The Osprey began breeding at the lake in 2018. becoming the fifth site in Wales.

She was a social reformer, pacifist and nonconformist. Biography Muriel Lester was a daughter of Henry Lester, a Baptist businessman, president of the Essex Baptist Union and chairman of West Ham school board.Jill Wallis, Lester, Muriel (1883‚Äì1968), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 . She was baptized in 1898, at 15. In Loughton, she lived with her parents at The Grange, and afterwards acquired a wooden house, Rose Cottage, which she renamed Rachel Cottage, and used as a holiday home for East-end children. She was responsible, along with her sister Doris Lester, for Kingsley Hall, named after her brother who died young, aged 26. In 1934 she became Ambassador-At- Large and afterwards Traveling Secretary for the International Fellowship of Reconciliation. Lester accompanied Mahatma Gandhi on his tour of earthquake- shaken regions in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934. He stayed at Kingsley Hall, the Lesters' foundation at Bow. There is a blue plaque to the Lester sisters on the cottage, no.49 Baldwins Hill, Loughton, which they acquired after The Grange and Rachel Cottage were sold for flats. This second cottage had previously been occupied by Sir Jacob Epstein. During the Spanish Civil War Muriel Lester was an active pacifist. She is pictured at a pacifist conference in 1936, standing fourth from the left of the photograph, in the Wikipedia entry for Jos√© Brocca. In his book White Corpuscles in Europe (1939) the American writer Allan A. Hunter viewed the close of the Spanish Civil War and the opening of World War II from across the Atlantic, and despite the desolate outlook in Europe saw some grounds for optimism in the work of humanitarians including Muriel Lester. Muriel Lester retired from full-time work in 1958 and in 1963 she became a Freeman of the Borough of Poplar on her eightieth birthday. She was recognized as one of the world's leading pacifists and The Nobel Prize organisation believes she may have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize at some point prior to the Second World War.https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/themes/heroines-of-peace-the-nine-nobel- women (Records of nominees were not kept prior to 1939.) The Muriel Lester Cooperative House at the University of Michigan is named after her. Family Lester is the aunt of George Hogg. They travelled together to Japan in 1937, from where Hogg continued to Shanghai and later the Chinese hinterlands; he subsequently became famous for saving 60 orphaned boys, marching them 1,100 km to safety.

It is the only urban rack railway in Germany, and one of only four rack railways operating in Germany, along with the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway, the Drachenfels Railway and the Wendelstein Railway. Overview Affectionately called Zacke (spike) by the residents of Stuttgart, the line was opened on 23 August 1884. It connects the urban districts of Stuttgart South (Marienplatz) and Degerloch (Albplatz). The route runs along the Alte Weinsteige, which was historically the main route to the Filder towns until the Neue Weinsteige was built in 1826. Over its 2.2 km route the line climbs a height of 205 m (from 260 m to 465 m AMSL). The maximum incline on the route is 17.5% (between Liststrasse and Pfaffenweg). On the branch line to the depot of the (old) rack railway yard, the maximum incline is 20.0%. Between the stops at Pfaffenweg and Wielandsh√∂he there is a view of Stuttgart's city centre. The rack railway is integrated with the metropolitan railway network of the Stuttgarter Stra√üenbahnen AG (SSB) as Line 10. At Marienplatz it connects with Stuttgart Stadtbahn lines U1 and U14 and at Albplatz it connects with lines U5, U6 and U8. The line is one of two working railway lines that are tourist attractions in Stuttgart; the other being the Stuttgart funicular railway that leads to the forest cemetery, and operates as SSB line 20. The rack railway train includes a wagon at the front or back for transporting bicycles.  History  *23 August 1884: Opening of the Stuttgart - Degerloch rack railway, the first section of the Filderbahn line, as a narrow gauge () steam-operated railway with a Riggenbach system. The Filderbahn Company operated the route from Stuttgart to Degerloch station. *1902: Electrification of the rack railway and the adhesion routes from Degerloch to Hohenheim and from M√∂hringen to Vaihingen. Electrification of the rack railway line was delayed by two years due to technical problems. *1903: Relocation of the passing track from Haigst to Wielandsh√∂he. *1904: Electrical operation begins on the rack railway, steam operation limited to Sunday excursions. *1918: Two additional steam engines taken over second-hand from the Swiss Br√ºnigbahn railway for steam services which had increased due to the war. *1920: Filderbahn taken over by the city of Stuttgart and its management transferred to the Stuttgarter Stra√üenbahnen (Stuttgart Tramways). *1921: Steam operations ended. *1926: All passenger coaches on the rack railway and Filderbahn repainted to SSB livery. However, to distinguish SSB-owned vehicles from Filderbahn-owned vehicles, the latter provisionally prefixed their vehicle numbers with the letter \\"F\\". *1934: Filderbahn and the rack railway transfer to the ownership of the Stuttgarter Stra√üenbahnen. *1935: First two railcars with 3 axles are delivered, number 101 (in service until 1982) and 102 (scrapped due to damage in 1974). *1936: Relocation of the rack railway's Stuttgart terminal station from the valley to Marienplatz to improve transfers to the trams. *1937: Motor coach 103 was the first vehicle built entirely of steel to be delivered to the SSB. *1950: Last two coaches of the second generation railcars delivered, number 104 (today a museum railcar) and 105 (dismantled in 1995). *1954: Last railcar of the first generation, number 109, is taken out of service. *1956: Transfer of trailer(s) from the Filderbahn to the rack railway to handle the increased school traffic. This was however extremely rarely done and then only up to 1965 when the practice was discontinued. *1965: Replacement of the old cast iron bridge (commonly called the Turkish bridge because its manufacturer, Maschinenfabrik Esslingen, originally intended to deliver the bridge to Turkey.) over the Neue Weinsteige by the present-day reinforced concrete bridge. *1971: As a result of changes to the track layout at Marienplatz and the construction of the underground station the double-tracked valley station at Marienplatz was replaced by a single-tracked station, half of which is located on the bridge across a water reservoir (later filled in). *1974: Railcar number 102, recently taken out of service, is paraded in the Stuttgart Shrove Tuesday procession as an attraction. *1977: As a result of the rebuilding of the rack railway's Degerloch station, the connecting track to the adhesion railway was lifted and the rack railway became isolated from the rest of the SSB network. *1978: Cessation of routine three-coach working. *1980: Refurbishing of the complete rack railway track for use with newly commissioned railcars of type ZT4. *1982: Introduction of modern ZT4 motor coaches into the metropolitan railway network. Trials on transporting bicycles on the inclined line in a demonstration wagon designed by the company. *1984: Centenary celebrations and last school run on the traditional rack railway route by motor coach 104 and demonstration car 120. *1989: Replacement of the former swinging leaf doors on the ZT4 by appropriate external swing out doors on the DT8. *1992: Sale of display car 117 (built 1896) to the H√§rtsfeld Museum Railway (HMB) in Neresheim. Hitherto it had been displayed by a private collector as a monument. The museum employs it today as narrow gauge passenger vehicle on its own line. *1994: Extension of the route at the top of the line to the Albplatz to improve the connection to the metropolitan railway. *2002: Reopening of the rebuilt terminal and bridge at the entirely redesigned and modernized Marienplatz (6 December). *2004: Replacement of the track superstructure; partial laying of a new, slightly narrower rack rail.

Members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein family are intracellular transcription factors that mediate many aspects of cellular immunity, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. They are primarily activated by membrane receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK). Dysregulation of this pathway is frequently observed in primary tumors and leads to increased angiogenesis which enhances the survival of tumors and immunosuppression. Gene knockout studies have provided evidence that STAT proteins are involved in the development and function of the immune system and play a role in maintaining immune tolerance and tumor surveillance. STAT family The first two STAT proteins were identified in the interferon system. There are seven mammalian STAT family members that have been identified: STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (STAT5A and STAT5B), and STAT6. STAT1 homodimers are involved in type II interferon signalling, and bind to the GAS (Interferon-Gamma Activated Sequence) promoter to induce expression of ISG (Interferon Stimulated Genes). In type I interferon signaling, STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer combines with IRF9 (Interferon Response Factor) to form ISGF3 (Interferon Stimulated Gene Factor), which binds to the ISRE (Interferon- Stimulated Response Element) promoter to induce ISG expression. Structure All seven STAT proteins share a common structural motif consisting of an N-terminal domain followed by a coiled-coil, DNA-binding, linker, Src homology 2 (SH2), and a C-terminal transactivation domain. Much research has focused on elucidating the roles each of these domains play in regulating different STAT isoforms. Both the N-terminal and SH2 domains mediate homo or heterodimer formation, while the coiled-coil domain functions partially as a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Transcriptional activity and DNA association are determined by the transactivation and DNA-binding domains, respectively. Activation Extracellular binding of cytokines or growth factors induce activation of receptor-associated Janus kinases, which phosphorylate a specific tyrosine residue within the STAT protein promoting dimerization via their SH2 domains. The phosphorylated dimer is then actively transported to the nucleus via an importin Œ±/Œ≤ ternary complex. Originally, STAT proteins were described as latent cytoplasmic transcription factors as phosphorylation was thought to be required for nuclear retention. However, unphosphorylated STAT proteins also shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus, and play a role in gene expression. Once STAT reaches the nucleus, it binds to a consensus DNA- recognition motif called gamma-activated sites (GAS) in the promoter region of cytokine-inducible genes and activates transcription. The STAT protein can be dephosphorylated by nuclear phosphatases, which leads to inactivation of STAT and subsequent transport out of the nucleus by an exportin-RanGTP complex.

Sometimes cited as a Slavic counterpart to the po√®tes maudits, Annensky managed to render into Russian the essential intonations of Baudelaire and Verlaine, while the subtle music, ominous allusions, arcane vocabulary, the spell of minutely changing colours and odours were all his own. His influence on the first post-Symbolist generation of poets (Akhmatova, Gumilyov, Mandelshtam) was paramount. Biography Annensky was born into the family of a public official in Omsk on 1 September N.S. 1855.In the memoirs of his son, Valentin Krivich the birth year was stated incorrectly as 1856, from there the date propagated in many biographies, the same incorrect birth year is even stated on Innokenty Anennsky's grave. Only in the 1970s a special archive investigation determined the correct birth year as 1855. See In 1860, while still a child, he was taken to Saint Petersburg. Innokenty lost his parents early on, and was raised in the family of his older brother, Nikolai Annensky, a prominent Narodnik and political activist. In 1879, Innokenty graduated from the philological department of St. Petersburg University, where he concentrated on Historical-comparative linguistics. He became a teacher, and taught classical languages and ancient literature studies in a gymnasium in Tsarskoe Selo. He served as the Director of this school from 1886 until his death in 1909. Anna Akhmatova graduated from this school, and called Annensky \\"my only teacher,\\" as did Nikolai Gumilev, who called him \\"the last of Tsarskoe Selo's swans.\\" Like Vasily Zhukovsky before him, Annensky was somewhat reluctant to publish his original poems and first gained renown with his masterful translations of Euripides and the French Symbolists. From 1890 until his death in 1909, he translated from Ancient Greek all the works of Euripides. At the beginning of the 1900s, Annensky wrote a series of tragedies modelled after those of ancient Greece: Melanippa-filosof (1901), Tsar Iksion (1903), Laodamia (1906). Some of these works were dedicated to his colleague, Faddei Zielinski, who would later write his obituary. As a literary critic, Annensky published The Book of Reflections, two volumes of essays on Nikolai Gogol, Mikhail Lermontov, Ivan Goncharov, and, his favourite, Fyodor Dostoyevsky. His essays were sometimes termed \\"critical prose\\" because of the artistic value of these texts. During his last months, Annensky worked as an editor of Sergei Makovsky's journal Apollon, in which he published some essays on poetry theory. Nikolai Gumilev valued these theoretical works very highly and considered Annensky to be the first true acmeist. In literary history, Annensky is remembered primarily as a poet. He started writing poetry in the 1870s but did not publish it. He followed the advice of his older brother, Nikolay, not to publish anything until he is 35. His first collection of poems, entitled Quiet Songs, was published in 1904 under the pseudonym Nik. T.-o (i.e., \\"No one\\" in Russian). It gained moderate praise from leading Symbolists, many of whom didn't suspect that Annensky was the author. His second book, Cypress Box, was much more important. The poet died just days before its projected publication. Many of his unpublished pieces were edited in the 1920s by his son, Valentin Krivich, who was a minor poet. On December 13 N.S. 1909, Innokenty Annensky died from a heart attack at the Tsarskoe Selo railway station in Saint Petersburg. His death was linked to family difficulties. Many of his finest pieces (e.g., Stansy, Dalnie Ruki) were inspired by Annensky's unrequited love for his daughter-in-law. Assessment Annensky's best poems are intricate and obscure: the images are meant to evoke (rather than to record) subtle associations of half-forgotten memories. He once said that the most important thing in poetry is a thread that would bind all the rambling associations into a tightly structured short poem. Aleksander Blok called him a necrophiliac poet, with death being his only theme. While this assessment may appear harsh and far-fetched, it is true that Annensky alluded to death in the sinister odours he cites in many of his poems.

It was invented by the Scottish engineer William Murdoch, an employee of Boulton and Watt, but was patented by James Watt in October 1781.http://himedo.net/TheHopkinThomasProject/TimeLine/Wales/Steam/JamesWatt/RobinsonMusson/JamesWattPatents.htm#Patent1781 It was invented to bypass the patent on the crank, already held by James Pickard. It played an important part in the development of devices for rotation in the Industrial Revolution. Operation Animation of Sun & Planet gear using Meccano. Notice that the sun and flywheel rotate twice for every circuit of the planet when they have a 1:1 ratio of teeth. Animation The sun and planet gear converted the vertical motion of a beam, driven by a steam engine, into circular motion using a 'planet', a cogwheel fixed at the end of the connecting rod (connected to the beam) of the engine. With the motion of the beam, this revolved around, and turned, the 'sun', a second rotating cog fixed to the drive shaft, thus generating rotary motion. An interesting feature of this arrangement, when compared to that of a simple crank, is that when both sun and planet have the same number of teeth, the drive shaft completes two revolutions for each double stroke of the beam instead of one. The planet gear is fixed to the connecting rod and thus does not rotate around its own axis. Note that the axle of the planet gear is tied to the axle of the sun gear by a link that freely rotates around the axis of the sun gear and keeps the planet gear engaged with the sun gear but does not contribute to the drive torque. This link appears, at first sight, to be similar to a crank but the drive is not transmitted through it. Thus, it did not contravene the crank patent.

She was the only surviving child of Madam C. J. Walker, popularly credited as being the first self-made female millionaire in the United States and one of the first African American millionaires. Biography =Early life= A'Lelia Walker was born Lelia McWilliams in Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1885, the daughter of Moses and Sarah (n√©e Breedlove) McWilliams. Her father died when she was 2. Her mother later married John Davis in 1894 and divorced in 1903. In 1906, her mother married Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaper advertising salesman, and became an independent hairdresser and retailer of cosmetic creams. A'Lelia grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and attended Knoxville College in Tennessee before entering the family business.A'Lelia Bundles, On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C. J. Walker, New York: Scribner (2001). =Career= Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company A'Lelia Walker became president of her mother's company in 1919, upon her mother's death, and remained in that position until her own death in August 1931. She initiated a number of marketing campaigns to promote the company‚Äîincluding a competition among prominent ministers for a Trip to the Holy Land in 1924‚Äîand remained the face of the Walker Company, but day-to-day operations were overseen by attorney F. B. Ransom and factory manager Alice Kelly at the Indianapolis headquarters. During the 1920s, A'Lelia Walker immersed herself in Harlem's dynamic social life as a patron of the arts and hostess of some of the era's most notable social gatherings. Walker Company sales began to suffer in 1929, with the beginning of the Great Depression. A new million-dollar headquarters and manufacturing facility, opened in late 1927 in Indianapolis, placed additional expenses and financial pressure on the operation, and she was forced to sell a great deal of valuable art and antiques. Her adopted daughter Mae Walker became company president from 1931 until her death in 1945. In a fourth- generation succession, Mae's daughter A'Lelia Mae Perry Bundles (b. 1928‚Äì d. 1976) succeeded her mother at the head of the company. Today the company's building is known as the Madam Walker Theatre Center and is a National Historic Landmark. Arts Patron A'Lelia Walker counted among her friends many accomplished African American musicians. She developed an early love of classical music and opera in part because the choir director at the AME church she and her mother attended in St. Louis was a classically trained opera singer and organist. She grew up in the neighborhood where Scott Joplin and other ragtime musicians gathered at Tom Turpin's Rosebud Cafe on St. Louis's Market Street. During the 1920s she hosted many musicians, actors, writers, artists, political figures and socialites in her townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street near Lenox Avenue. The elegant brick and limestone building had been designed by Vertner Tandy, a founder of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and the first black architect licensed in New York State. Almost from the time of her arrival in Harlem in 1913, her dinner parties, dances and soirees included well known Harlem figures like James Reese Europe, J. Rosamand Johnson, Bert Williams and Florence Mills. Live music‚Äîfrom classical and ragtime to jazz and blues‚Äîwas a regular feature with entertainment provided by her musician friends. In October 1927, she converted a floor of the home into The Dark Tower, a cultural salon that became legendary as one of the gathering places of the era, a place where Harlem's talented artists socialized with their Greenwich Village counterparts as well as European and African royalty. She commissioned Austrian designer Paul Frankl to create the interior. She also entertained at Villa Lewaro, her country house in Westchester County and at her pied-√†-terre at 80 Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem. Personal life Walker was married three times: to John Robinson, a hotel waiter,U. S. Census 1910 from whom she separated about 1911 and divorced in 1914; to Dr. Wiley Wilson in 1919; and to Dr. James Arthur Kennedy, in 1926, whom she divorced just a few months before her death in 1931.

Its exact identification is unclear, but in the modern day it is generally translated as \\"harp\\" or \\"lyre\\", and associated with a type of lyre depicted in Israelite imagery, particularly the Bar Kochba coins. It has been referred to as the \\"national instrument\\" of the Jewish people, and modern luthiers have created reproduction lyres of the \\"kinnor\\" based on this imagery. The word has subsequently come to mean violin in Modern Hebrew. Identification The kinnor is generally agreed to be a stringed instrument, and thus the stringed instrument most commonly mentioned in the Old Testament. The kinnor is also the first string instrument to be mentioned in the Bible, appearing in Genesis 4:21. Details Schematic drawing of an ancient kinnor =Construction= Josephus describes the kinnor as having 10 strings, made from a sheep's small intestine, and played with a plectrum (pick), though the Book of Samuel notes that David played the kinnor \\"with his hand\\". The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia also notes that the early church fathers agreed the kithara (kinnor) had its resonator in the lower parts of its body. Like the nevel, the kinnor likely consisted of a soundboard with two arms extending parallel to the body, with the arms crossed by a yoke from which the strings extend down to the body. One etymology of Kinneret, the Hebrew name of the Sea of Galilee, is that it derives from kinnor, on account of the shape of the lake resembling that of the instrument.Jeremy Montagu, Musical Instruments of the Bible, Scarecrow Press, 2002, p. 15 If this etymology is correct it may be relevant to the question of the shape of the instrument. =Usage= The kinnor is mentioned 42 times in the Old Testament, in relation to \\"divine worship... prophecy... secular festivals... and prostitution.\\" The kinnor is sometimes mentioned in conjunction with the nevel, which is also presumed to be a lyre but larger and louder than the kinnor. The Mishna states that the minimum number of kinnor to be played in the Temple is nine, with no maximum limit. =Use of the word in Modern Hebrew= The word ◊õ◊ô◊†◊ï◊® kin√≥r is used in Modern Hebrew to signify the modern Western violin.Jeremy Montagu, Musical Instruments of the Bible, Scarecrow Press, 2002, p. 12 Image use in coinage The image of an ancient lyre copied from what was proven to be a fake presented and sold as an ancient medallion, is in use on the 50 Agurot coin.

Early life Charlotte, born at the chateau of Thouars, Poitou, in France, was the daughter of the French nobleman Claude de La Tr√©moille, 2nd Duke of Thouars, and his wife, Countess Charlotte Brabantina of Nassau. Her maternal grandparents were William I, Prince of Orange, and Charlotte de Bourbon. On 26 June 1626, Charlotte married the English nobleman James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, and was naturalised as an English citizen by Act of Parliament in February 1629. Her husband was a Royalist commander in the English Civil War, later taken prisoner at Nantwich in 1651 and beheaded at Bolton. English Civil War Lady Derby was famous for her defence of Lathom House in the Siege of Lathom House by Parliamentary forces during the First English Civil War in 1644. During the absence of her spouse, she was left in charge of what turned out to be the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Lancashire. Immediately after the fall of Warrington, she was requested to acknowledge Parliament's authority and surrender her house, but she refused on the grounds that doing so would dishonour her husband. She offered to limit herself to defending her home and this postponed further attacks on her position.P. Draper \\"The House of Stanley\\" 1864 pp 100/101 In February 1644, Latham House was besieged by the forces of Sir Thomas Fairfax. Lady Derby had fortified the castle to resist bombardment and assembled a militia of seasoned marksmen who were able to inflict significant losses by sniping. She expressly refused repeated offers of surrender. On 27 May 1644, Prince Rupert arrived with Royalist forces and the siege was broken. Lady Derby and her staff were evacuated to the Isle of Man. Lady Derby's defence of Lathom House is commemorated in Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem. Isle of Man Her husband was also Lord of Mann. Lady Derby's attempt to barter the island for her husband's freedom provoked an anti-English revolt led by Illiam Dhone. Lady Derby was holding Man, but the total destruction of the Royal army at Worcester, the flight of Prince Charles to an exile in France and the execution of her husband left her without hope of assistance. She eventually yielded with reluctance to the necessity of a surrender and retained, says David Hume, \\"the glory of being the last person in the three kingdoms, and in all their dependent dominions, who submitted to the victorious rebels\\". Family Charlotte and Derby were parents of four daughters and six sons. Only five of their children appear to have survived to a marriageable age: *Charles Stanley, 8th Earl of Derby (19 January 1628 ‚Äì 21 December 1672). *Lady Henriette Mary Stanley (17 November 1630 ‚Äì 27 December 1685) married William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford. *Lady Amelia Ann Sophia Stanley (1633 ‚Äì 22 February 1702/3) married John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl. *Lady Catherine Stanley married Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester. *John Stanley (4 November 1641 ‚Äì 10 September 1719) married a commoner, Alice Biddle. Charles's two sons, William, the 9th Earl (c. 1655‚Äì1702), and James, the 10th (1664‚Äì1736), both died without sons, and consequently, when James died in February 1736, his titles and estates passed to Sir Edward Stanley (1689‚Äì1776), a descendant of the 1st Earl.

Nicolaus, however, abandoned the siege on the approach of the Seleucid king. In the same year he did much towards baffling the attempt of Antiochus on Dora in Phoenicia, by sending constant succours to the besieged. In 218 BC he was invested by Ptolemy with the supreme command in Coele-Syria, an appointment fully warranted, according to Polybius, by his military experience and bravery. He was, however, dislodged by Antiochus and his generals from a strong position which he had taken up between the range of Mount Lebanon and the sea near the town of Porphyreon, and was obliged to seek safety in a precipitate flight towards Sidon.

The floor of the hall is divided into two equal halves and one part is for performance (including stage, instruments, green room etc.) and other half for seating audience. During the performance, the stage is decorated with fruit-bearing plantains, bunches of coconuts and fronds of the coconut palm. A para filled with rice is placed on the stage.

At the age of fifteen, Nyiregyh√°zi played Liszt's Piano Concerto in A major, with the Berlin Philharmonic under Arthur Nikisch. His Carnegie Hall debut in 1920 was impressive but controversial. Richard Aldrich of the New York Times noted Nyiregyh√°zi's \\"brilliant technical equipment, great strength of arm and fingers, remarkable dexterity, a fine feeling for piano tone\\" but was critical of his \\"often erratic and misleading\\" conceptions of \\"some of the most familiar compositions for the piano\\".Richard Aldrich, \\"Music: Mr. Nyredghazi's Recital\\", New York Times (October 19, 1920). H. T. Finck of the Evening Post praised Nyiregyh√°zi's \\"originality\\", while criticizing his \\"arbitrary disregard of the obvious intentions of great composers.\\"Bazzana (2007): page 85. In a 1935 letter to Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg wrote the following about him: > ...a pianist who appears to be something really quite extraordinary. I had > to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd > heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. But > I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, he does > not play at all in the style you and I strive for.

Descent into obscurity and reemergence In 1925, Nyiregyh√°zi sued his concert manager, R. E. Johnston, alleging that he was being treated as an inferior artist by accompanying singers and instrumentalists. He lost the suit, and thereafter had difficulty finding concert work. In addition, Nyiregyh√°zi ‚Äì who feared comparison with other pianists ‚Äì was reluctant to play the standard repertoire and favored performing his own transcriptions of orchestral and operatic works. By the time Schoenberg's letter was written, Nyiregyh√°zi's career seemed to be effectively finished. Nyiregyh√°zi was married ten times. His first wife allegedly attacked him with a knife, leading to a messy publicized divorce. Although born into comfortable circumstances (his mother insisted that the servants tie his shoes and feed him by hand so as to relieve him of mundane concerns) he nonetheless spent the better part of his life in poverty, at times reduced to sleeping in subways. In 1928, Nyiregyh√°zi moved to Los Angeles and worked for a film studio, initially playing piano reductions of film scores, and later as a hand double. Nyiregyh√°zi's hands are shown playing piano in A Song to Remember and Song of Love, among others.Bazzana (2007): 205. He became friends with Bela Lugosi and Gloria Swanson, among others. However, his inability to manage his affairs led not only to financial crises, but also to unusual career decisions. In the 1930s, he played piano as part of a Works Progress Administration project. But the most unusual appearance was likely a 1946 recital where he was billed as \\"Mr. X\\" and played while wearing a black silk hood. Several listeners were able to identify Nyiregyh√°zi by his distinctive sonority.Bazzana (2007): 205‚Äì206. Although he continued to play occasionally, he did not own a piano for roughly forty years. Several public appearances in 1972 and 1973 led to studio recordings made, in 1974 and 1978, under the auspices of the International Piano Archives and the Ford Foundation. Some of these recordings were released, between 1977 and 1979, on albums on the Desmar and Columbia Masterworks labels, which briefly brought Nyiregyh√°zi back into public view.Harold C. Schonberg, \\"After 50 Years (and 9 Wives), Erwin Nyiregyhazi Is Back at the Piano\\", New York Times (February 13, 1978). An all-Liszt double album won Stereo Review's 1978 Record of the Year award.The Gramophone, Volume 85, Issue 1, p. 34 Critical reaction to the recordings was sharply divided, with some claiming to hear an authentic 19th-Century pianist (Harold C. Schonberg wrote that \\"some critics wonder if Franz Liszt had been reincarnated\\"Harold C. Schonberg, \\"The Case of The Vanishing Pianist\\", New York Times (March 5, 1978).). Others denounced Nyiregyhazi's \\"incredibly slipshod\\" technique, \\"ridiculously amateurish\\" fortissimo playing Bazzana, (2007) page 278, quoting Dean Elder in Clavier magazine \\"glacial tempos and total dissociation from contemporary performance styles. But Romantic revivalists were enthralled.\\"John Rockwell, \\"Erwin Nyiregyhazi Dies at 84; Pianist Regained Fame in 70's\\", New York Times (April 16, 1987). In 1978, he was offered return concerts at Carnegie Hall, but he declined. Recitals in Japan in 1980 and 1982 constituted his last public appearances. Nyiregyh√°zi was also a prolific composer, writing in a Romantic style reminiscent of Liszt. Nyiregyh√°zi was often moved to compose by outside events, and his compositions included titles such as Goetz Versus the Punks, It‚Äôs Nice to be Soused, Shotgun Wedding, and Vanishing Hope. Only a few of his compositions have ever been published or performed.Bazzana (2007): 228, 231, 232, 329 Death and burial Ervin Nyiregyh√°zi died from colon cancer in 1987. He was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Only the last of his ten wives survived him. Recordings A few of Nyiregyh√°zi's recordings, including some live performances, have been issued on CD on the VAI, Music and Arts, and Sonetto Classics labels.

When young, he apprenticed with Aurelio Buso of Crema, a pupil of Polidoro da Caravaggio. He was sponsored in Genoa by Tobia Pallavicino and sent to Rome for some years. He returned to decorate the palazzo Pallavicino and the church of San Marcellino. He painted of the Martyrdom of St. Sebastian in the monastery of San Sebastiano. Along with Luca Cambiaso, was commissioned by the Duke Grimaldi to decorate the ceiling of the choir of the Nunziata di Portoria in Genoa, with a fresco of Christ as judge of the world. He worked on various projects with his friend Cambiaso, including in a chapel for the Duomo di San Lorenzo. He decorated rooms of the Villa Lanzi, Gorlago, near Bergamo, with scenes from the Iliad. In 1567 he was invited to Madrid to become painter and architect to Philip II. He also executed some works in the Escorial, and died holding the office of architect of the royal palaces, including the Pardo Palace. As architect, he is supposed to have remodeled the church of San Matteo in Genoa and to have designed the imperial palace at Campetto. He died at Madrid in 1569 or 1579.

Biography  Dufresny was born in Paris. The allegation that his grandfather was an illegitimate son of Henry IV procured him the liberal patronage of Louis XIV, who gave him the post of valet de chambre, and affixed his name to many lucrative privileges. Dufresny's expensive habits neutralized all efforts to enrich him, and as if to furnish a piquant commentary on the proverb that poverty makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows, he married, as his second wife, a washerwoman, in discharge of her bill a whimsicality which supplied Alain-Ren√© Lesage with an episode in Le Diable boiteux (1707), and was made the subject of a comedy by J. M. Deschamps (Charles Rivi√®re Dufresny, ou le marriage impromptu). He died in Paris. His plays, destitute for the most part of all higher qualities, abound in sprightly wit and pithy sayings. In the six volumes of his Th√©atre (Paris, 1731), some of the best are L'Esprit de contradiction (1700), Le Double Veuvage (1701), La Joueuse (1709), La Coquette de village (1715), La R√©conciliation normande (1719) and Le Marriage fait et rompu (1721). A volume of Po√©sies diverses, two volumes of Nouvelles historiques (1692), and Les Amusements s√©rieux et comiques d'un Siamois (1705), a work to which Montesquieu was indebted for the idea of his Lettres persanes, complete the list of Dufresny's writings. The best edition of his works is that of 1747 (4 vols.). His Th√©atre was edited (1882) by Georges d'Heylli. His comedies include: *1692: L'Op√©ra de campagne *1692: Le N√©gligent *1697: Les f√©es, ou Contes de ma m√®re l'oye *1697: Le Chevalier joueur *1699: La Malade sans maladie *1699: La Noce interrompue *1700: L'Esprit de contradiction *1701: Le Double Veuvage *1703: Le Faux Honn√™te-Homme *1708: Le Jaloux honteux *1709: La Joueuse *1715: La Coquette de village, ou Le lot suppos√© *1719: Le D√©dit *1719: La R√©conciliation normande *1721: Le Mariage fait et rompu, ou l'h√¥tesse de Marseille *1731: Le Faux Sinc√®re He also wrote short stories: ', Le Puits de la v√©rit√©, histoire gauloise (1698), Amusements s√©rieux et comiques (Paris, 1699, in-12, Second edition augmented, 1707)?

He is from the village of Cherso, near the city of Kilkis in Central Macedonia. Biography Dimitris Basis was born in Stuttgart. His parents lived in Germany for some years. He came to Greece for the first time at the age of eight when his entire family returned to Cherso, a small village near the Greek‚ÄìNorth Macedonian border. At the age of nine, he started chanting the liturgy in the local church and three years later he began to study Byzantine music. He gained his diploma at the age of seventeen. At the same time he used to sing at many cultural celebrations. When he was twenty years old just after his first steps in professional singing he was discovered by Stamatis Kraounakis and Warner Music company, who immediately offered him a contract. For three continuous seasons he was singing with Alkistis Protopsalti, Stamatis Kraounakis and Lina Nikolakopoulou, and met success due to his musical performances under the music director Andreas Voutsinas. His professional debut began with his participation in two of Stamatis Kraounakis works: ‚ÄúOtan Erhonde I Fili mou‚Äù where he sang two songs and in the soundtrack of the T.V. series ‚ÄúTo Trito Stefani‚Äù where he took part in one song. In 1996 he collaborated with Christos Nikolopoulos and he performed live. In 1997 his first album became a reality with the title ‚ÄúMe tin Fora tou Anemou‚Äù (music by Christos Nikolopoulos, Kostas Falkonis and lyrics by Christos Papadopoulos). Eight months later the soundtrack of T.V. series ‚ÄúPsithiri Kardias‚Äù was in music stores (music by Christos Nikolopoulos and lyrics by Eleni Giannatsoulia). It was a tremendous success with over 120,000 sales. Dimitris Basis‚Äô voice started to be heard not only in Greece but abroad as well. In the next season he worked with Dimitra Galani and Manolis Lidakis and by the end of 1998 his second personal album ‚ÄúSe Anihtous Ouranous‚Äù is ready (music by Christos Nikolopoulos and lyrics by Aris Davarakis, Eleni Giannatsoulia). The winter period of 1998‚Äì99 was important to Dimitris Mpasis‚Äô career because of his collaboration with Haris Alexiou. In the summer of 1999 he started a series of concerts all over Greece and Cyprus with Giannis Kotsiras. That same summer he performed with Stavros Xarhakos in a series of concerts with K.O.E.M. (National Orchestra of Greek Music) both in Greece and abroad. Simultaneously he took part in a dedicated concert for Christos Nikolopoulos in the Athens Concert Hall. This concert was also performed again in the Herodes Atticus Odeon. In October 1999 he gave a series of concerts in Australia with Irini Haridou. In the winter of 1999 and 2000, we saw him with Eleni Tsaligopoulou. In 2000, his personal album ‚ÄúMilao Hronia‚Äù was in the stores (music by Vaso Alagianni and lyrics by Nikos Moraitis). The year 2001 was a decisive year in his career because he met the great Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis who proposed to revise and perform together one of his most important works: ‚ÄúTo Tragoudi tou Nekrou Adelfou‚Äù. This particular work had been sung for first time in 1961 by Grigoris Bithikotsis but was never completed as due to the political situation at that time some songs had been censored. For this work the great composer decided -after 17 years of absence from studios- to get back to work and lead ‚ÄúThe Popular Orchestra Mikis Theodorakis‚Äù. Some months later a new Dimitris Basis‚Äô album followed. Its title was ‚ÄúI Agapi Ine Fotia‚Äù and its songs were mostly remakes of Mikis Theodorakis love songs. In December 2001 he started his appearances together with Yannis Kotsiras in Athens and their success continued until March 2002 in Thessaloniki. This success presented them with the title of the most commercial music duet of the summer. Next winter found Dimitris Basis in an ‚Äúalliance‚Äù with Pashalis Terzis and Dimitris Mitropanos. This music shape was created at the same time as the announcement by the music company MINOS ‚Äì EMI that a new album with the name ‚ÄúDimitris Basis‚Äù was being released (2003). It was an artistic work from various creators, including popular songs such as \\"I Zoi\\" and \\"Ki Efyga\\". From the first date of its release it gained the acceptance of public and critics who admired Basis‚Äô music personality one more time. In the summer of 2003, he took part in a dedication to the poet Yiannis Ritsos ‚Äìthroughout Greece- with the ‚ÄúMikis Theodorakis‚Äù Orchestra. The poems (‚ÄúEpitaphios, Romiosini, Ta Dekaohto Lianotragouda tis Pikris Patridas, I Piites tou Kosmou) were composed by Mikis Theodorakis. In December 2003 he started a very successful collaboration with Manolis Lidakis in Thessaloniki which continued with additional appearances in Athens and in summer concerts all over Greece. At the same time he was working on his new CD with the title ‚ÄúDiskoli Kardia‚Äù (music by Nikos Antipas and lyrics by Lina Nikolakopoulou, Mirto Kontova) which was released in December 2004. In the summer of 2004 he gave some personal concerts with songs from his entire repertoire. He also sang alongside Maria Farantouri, songs of the great Mikis Theodorakis. In the winter of 2004‚Äì2005, he started his appearances with Dimitris Mitropanos and Themis Adamantidis in Athens and Thessaloniki. Their work was a hymn to \\"Zeimbekiko\\" dance (in Greek culture, a man's dance). The cd of their live appearances in \\"Akti Pireos\\" released in April with the title \\"Iparhi ke to Zeimbekiko\\". In May 2005, he took part in the celebrations in honour of the eightieth birthday of the famous composer Mikis Theodorakis. The titles of the songs which he sang were \\"The Songs of Passion and Love\\". These celebrations took place during the \\"Greek Festival\\" in Herod Atticus Odeon. In the same year's summer he departed for first time on a successful solo tour at selected cities around Greece.

The town sits on the road from Pinjarra to Williams on the Hotham River. Boddington public artwork History The town owes its name to an early settler, Henry Boddington, who was a farmer and shepherd in the 1860s and 1870s and leased land in the area in 1875, later moving to Wagin. His name became associated with a pool in the Hotham River at which he frequently camped. The original settled locality was called Hotham, west of the town at what is now the end of Farmers Avenue, named for the Farmer family, and a post office and school were established. When the Hotham Valley Railway was being constructed in 1912 to meet demand created by the local timber industry, a townsite was chosen adjacent to the town, and subsequently gazetted. The town was built in the 1920s, with a school, hospital, council offices, post office, shops and agricultural hall. A railway bridge was built over the upper reaches of the Murray River in 1949, then known as \\"Asquith Bridge\\", and was used for carting railway timber to the Banksiadale Sawmill. The area declined slowly over time, and the 1961 Western Australian bushfires devastated the local timber industry. By 1969, the railway had been closed and Boddington became a typical small service area for the surrounding district. However, the establishment of bauxite mining in 1979 to service Western Australia's alumina production at Worsley, Kwinana and Wagerup, and the opening of the Boddington Gold Mine in 1987 created a thriving mining town. Present day Boddington is located off Albany Highway and southeast of Perth in the Darling Scarp. It is the centre of a sheep and timber district as well as a service centre for the nearby bauxite and gold mines. Boddington contains a TAFE centre, and each year on the first weekend of November hosts a 3-day rodeo. In addition, a district high school, National Australia Bank, shopping facilities, accommodation (hotel, motel, caravan park), council offices and a telecentre are located within the town. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,198 people in Boddington. 74.1% of people were born in Australia and 87.3% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.2%, Anglican 22.1% and Catholic 13.1%. =District= A Royal Historical Society plaque near the town marks the grave of a local Aboriginal named Quency Dilyan who helped explorers Alexander Forrest and H.S. Ranford during their expeditions in the area. Several scenic drives and bushwalking tracks have been set up by the shire council through state forests and wildflower country.  Economy  The town's economy is supported by mining and agriculture. The Shire of Boddington is home to the Newmont Mining owned Boddington Gold Mine and the South32 operated Boddington Bauxite Mine. Due to its mining activities, the town is undergoing a significant growth phase. The Peel Development Commission predicts the population of Boddington will double by 2012 and up to 400 new residences will be required. The Boddington Shire have approved several land developments ranging from larger lifestyle lots to smaller lot residential developments.

Tarpley is a founder of the Tax Wall Street Party. Education Tarpley was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in 1946. After receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Languages from Princeton University in 1966, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, he became a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Turin, Italy. He later earned a Master of Arts in humanities from Skidmore College and a Ph.D. in early modern history from the Catholic University of America. Career In 1971, Tarpley was on the editorial board of The Campaigner, a National Caucus of Labor Committees' journal, according to its masthead. In 1986, Tarpley attempted to run on Lyndon LaRouche's U.S. Labor Party platform in the New York State Democratic Party primary for the U.S. Senate, but was ruled off the ballot because of a defect in his nominating petitions. In 1992, Tarpley co-authored with Anton Chaitkin George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography, published by LaRouche's Executive Intelligence Review magazine. Since March 2006, Tarpley has hosted a weekly online talk show called World Crisis Radio, broadcast by GCNLive.com. Tarpley is a member of the \\"world anti-imperialist conference\\" Axis for Peace, of Scholars for 9/11 Truth and of a research Netzwerk of German 9/11 authors founded in September 2006. Tarpley has expounded the \\"Versailles Thesis\\" laying the blame for the great wars of the 20th century on intrigues by Britain to retain her dominance. In addition to World Crisis Radio, Tarpley also hosts the podcast, the AmericanSystem.tv. This subscription-based program airs Monday-Thursday at 9 p.m. EST. The podcast is co-hosted with Daniela Walls, the chairperson of the Tax Wall Street Party.http://americansystem.tv/ 9/11 and terrorism analysis The \\"rogue network\\" which Tarpley suspects of the September 11 attacks Tarpley maintains that the September 11 attacks were engineered by a rogue network of the military-industrial complex and intelligence agencies as a false-flag operation.9/11 Synthetic Terror, Progressive Press, 5th edition, 2011, Military‚Äìindustrial complex, passim. The common account about the events of 9/11 are in Tarpley's opinion in 2006 an \\"outrageous myth\\" and an \\"absurd fairy tale.\\" The organisations involved in 9/11 apparently included Britain's MI6 as well as \\"government officials loyal to the invisible government.\\" On November 21, 2011, while traveling to Syria, Tarpley told Syria's Addounia TV that the Syrian Civil War was a NATO‚ÄìCIA ploy to destabilize Syria using mercenaries and death squads against the population and the Syrian government. On April 2, 2012, C-SPAN aired 9/11, False Flags, and Black Ops: An Evening of Debate, in which Tarpley debated his critic Jonathan Kay on conspiracy theories, specifically the truth behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. David Frum, who served as moderator between the two men, described Tarpley's \\"presentation as involuted as it was long-winded.\\" During the event, Tarpley said that the Attack on Pearl Harbor was also a government conspiracy. On June 7, 2012, interviewed for the NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) regarding the 2011 Norway attacks, Tarpley said, \\"I believe that the evidence points to a private network, or even a NATO network, within the police that contributed the long time delay until they stormed the Island.\\" Tarpley told Press TV on June 18, 2013 that revelations about the National Security Agency by their former computer system administrator Edward Snowden outlining global and domestic spying by US intelligence agencies might be seen as a \\"CIA limited hangout operation,\\" that is, to publicize minor public manipulation operations to conceal greater covert misdeeds such as promoting war in the Middle East. He claimed such \\"gullibility\\" operations could be traced from Daniel Ellsberg to Julian Assange's WikiLeaks, with a legacy in perfidious politics and governance since the 17th century. He has said Snowden is probably a triple agent ultimately being an agent for the CIA with the aim of weakening President Barack Obama and pushing him into intervening in Syria. On January 21, 2015 Tarpley was interviewed by Guns and Butter's Bonnie Faulkner about \\"geopolitical terrorism and the destabilization of governments and how others like Russia and Belarus are responding\\".The World Rebels Against Wall Street Rule, soundcloud.com. Retrieved on 16 December 2018.Ten Topics/Ten Shows , gunsandbutter.org. Retrieved on 16 December 2018. Criticism Critics of Tarpley have said that he still sells copies of the book on the Bush family he co-authored while working for Lyndon LaRouche. The book was criticized by David Neiwert, who wrote: > Like most Larouche texts, the Bush \\"biography\\" is a m√©lange of fact and > distortion, written in a highly suppositional style that makes numerous > leaps of logic and asserts connections where there is no real evidence to > support it, at other times omitting exculpatory or contrary information that > reveals a more complete picture.

Despite the name, it does not traditionally contain pineapple; rather, the name refers to the look of the characteristic topping (which resembles the texture of a pineapple). History In June 2014, the Hong Kong Government listed the pineapple bun as a part of Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage. Tai Tung Bakery in Yuen Long, which had been making pineapple buns for more than 70 years, was a key proponent of including the technique for making the buns on the list of 480 items of living heritage. Composition The top of the pineapple bun (the part which is made to resemble a pineapple) is made of a dough similar to that used to make sugar cookies, which consists of sugar, eggs, flour, and lard. It is crunchy and is quite sweet compared to the bread underneath. The bread dough underneath is the same as that used in Chinese-style Western breads, which is a softer and sweeter dough than in Western breads. It is popular at breakfast or afternoon tea. Although it is known as a \\"pineapple bun\\", the traditional version contains no pineapple. The name originated from the fact that its sugary top crust is cooked to a golden- brown color, and because its checkered top resembles the epicarp of a pineapple. Buttered variant Buttered pineapple bun Many Hong Kong restaurants, such as cha chaan tengs and dai pai dongs, offer an item called a buttered pineapple bun, which is a pineapple bun with a piece of butter stuffed inside. They are known in Cantonese as boh loh yau (Ëè†ËòøÊ≤π), in which boh loh means \\"pineapple\\", and yau (oil) refers to butter. Variants of this include using custard in place of butter. Typically the bun is brought hot from the oven to the diner's table, and served halved with a large slab of butter in between the halves. This item is sometimes criticised for containing much fat and cholesterol. Other common variants The pineapple bun may come in miniature sizes (Ëø∑‰Ω†Ëè†ËòøÂåÖ), it may be used as a bread roll for sandwiches with luncheon meat (È§êËÇâËè†ËòøÂåÖ), or it may be pre-stuffed with red bean paste (Á¥ÖË±ÜËè†ËòøÂåÖ), custard cream (Â•∂ÈªÉËè†ËòøÂåÖ), barbecued pork (ÂèâÁáíËè†ËòøÂåÖ), or a sweet filling of shredded coconut (Ê§∞Áµ≤Ëè†ËòøÂåÖ) like that in a cocktail bun. It is possible to order a \\"pineapple pineapple bun\\", actually stuffed with pineapple (Ëè†ËòøËè†ËòøÂåÖ), although this is very likely the product of misinterpretation of the name by non-native bakers. Japanese melonpan and Korean soboro bread are variants that use the same ingredients for a German streusel-like texture on top but without resemblance to a pineapple. In popular culture *McDull, the main character in the Hong Kong cartoon film McDull, Prince de la Bun is often seen with a pineapple bun, since the Chinese name of the film is Ëè†ËòøÊ≤πÁéãÂ≠ê (Prince of Pineapple Bun with Butter). *In 2005, \\"pineapple bun\\" was nominated as the name of a typhoon, but was rejected because the director of the Hong Kong Observatory stated that news reports concerning the typhoon would sound nonsensical. =Controversy= In September 2014, a police raid found that, unwittingly, several suppliers (including Starbucks, 7-Eleven and Cafe Express) had been selling pineapple buns made with tainted oil, known as \\"gutter oil\\", from an unlicensed factory in Taiwan. This oil was recycled from kitchen waste, as well as being a by-product of leather processing and offal from slaughterhouses.Starbucks and 7-Eleven in Hong Kong drawn into ‚Äògutter oil‚Äô scandal  South China Morning Post See also *Conchas *Bun *List of buns *Melonpan, the Japanese equivalent of pineapple bun References External links Category:Dim sum Category:Sweet breads Category:Macanese cuisine Category:Buns Category:Hong Kong breads Category:Stuffed dishes ","title":"Pineapple bun"},{"id":"2626425","text":"Frank Tiberi (born December 4, 1928) is the leader of the Woody Herman Orchestra.

Interspersed with straight rock, blues and pop items, A Salty Dog showed a slight change of direction from its predecessors, being thematically less obscure. The title track itself was the first Procol track to use an orchestra, as would be referred to in the live album performance released some three years later. The album was the first record produced by Matthew Fisher, who quit the band soon after its release. This was also the last Procol Harum album to feature bass guitarist Dave Knights.  Background and recording  A Salty Dog was recorded in March 1969. The musical tensions between the group and Robin Trower were beginning to show in this album, and although his guitar sound remains integral to most of the tracks, \\"Crucifiction Lane\\" (featuring a rare Trower vocal), in retrospect, shows that Trower was already moving in a different direction from the rest of the band. Still, this album is much more musically varied than the two previous albums, with three Fisher vocals and one by Trower. Reportedly, when Gary Brooker first played \\"A Salty Dog\\" at the piano for B.J. Wilson, a sunbeam illumined Wilson's face and he told Brooker he thought it was the most beautiful song he had ever heard.  Release  A Salty Dog was released in June 1969 by record labels Regal Zonophone and A&M.; The title track, backed with \\"Long Gone Geek\\", reached number 44 in the UK Singles Chart in 1969 and the album itself number 27 in the Albums Chart.  Reception  John Mendelson, writing for Rolling Stone, called it \\"a confusing album. At its best it represents the group's greatest success to date with the brand of rock for which the group is known; at its worst it is both surprisingly mediocre and trivial\\". Robert Christgau was more enthusiastic in The Village Voice, giving it an \\"A+\\", although he later said the printed grade was \\"a mistake\\" and should have probably been a \\"B+\\". In a retrospective review, Bruce Eder of AllMusic wrote, \\"This album, the group's third, was where they showed just how far their talents extended across the musical landscape, from blues to R&B; to classical rock. In contrast to their hastily recorded debut, or its successor, done to stretch their performance and composition range\\", calling the title track \\"one of the finest songs ever to come from Procol Harum and one of the best pieces of progressive rock ever heard\\".  Cover versions  The title track was covered by Transatlantic and was featured on the two-disc Special Edition of The Whirlwind. It is sung by drummer Mike Portnoy. Styx covered the song on their cover album Big Bang Theory (2005) with Lawrence Gowan on lead vocals. Sarah Brightman covered the song too on her album Dive in the year 1993.

Life Arditi was born in Crescentino, Piemonte (Italy). He began his musical career as a violinist, and studied music at the Conservatory of Milan. He made his debut in 1843 as a director at Vercelli, and it was there that he was made an honorary member of the Philharmonic Academy. Arditi conducted opera throughout Italy and in 1846 found himself conducting as far afield as Havana, Cuba. (This was where he first met Bottesini). He visited America, where he remained for a while, conducting operas in New York, Philadelphia and other cities with the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company until 1856. Then, following a visit to Constantinople, he decided to settle in London, but made several trips again to America with the Royal Italian Opera Company. He also conducted in Germany, and in other major European cities such as St. Petersburg, Vienna and Madrid. After 1885, he was in England, conducting at Covent Garden and in various prestigious theatres and promenade concerts in London's parks. He died at Hove, near Brighton (England). His mortal remains are buried in Hove Cemetery. Arditi's best-known operas are: I Briganti, II Corsaro, and La Spia, (\\"The Spy\\"). In addition he wrote numerous songs and vocal waltzes, the most popular of which are \\"Il Bacio\\" (\\"The Kiss\\", dedicated to Marietta Piccolomini, to a text specially written by baritone Gottardo Aldighieri),Arditi, My Reminiscences, pp.68-70 and 325. Il bacio was to become famous as it was usually interpolated by Adelina Patti into the singing lesson in Act 2 of Rossini's The Barber of Seville (Luana D'Agu√¨, Bologna - Teatro Comunale: Il Barbiere di Siviglia, \\"OperaClick\\") \\"Le Tortorelle\\" (\\"The Dove\\", dedicated to Etelka Gerster), \\"Se Saran Rose\\" (\\"Rosebuds\\", also titled in English \\"Love in Springtime\\", dedicated to Adelina Patti), and \\"Parla\\" (\\"Speak!\\"). His Inno Turco (1856) for Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I set to a Turkish text was later sung in London during the state visit of Sultan Abd√ºlaziz at Crystal Palace by a British choir of 1600 in July 1867.

It is inspired by the Dungeon Siege video game series. The English-language film was an international (German, American, and Canadian) co-production and filmed in Canada. It premiered at the Brussels Festival of Fantastic Films in April 2007 and was released in theatres on November 2007. Plot In the kingdom of Ehb, a man known only as Farmer is living a happy life with his wife Solana and their young son Zeph in the town of Stonebridge. One day, the town gets attacked by creatures known as the Krug. The Krug, who are known to be primitive and animal-like, surprise the people by taking up arms, donning armor and are fighting with courage, intelligence and ferocity. It's all because of they're magically controlled by Gallian, a powerful Magus who has become sadistic and megalomaniacal and seeks to conquer and rule Ehb. During the attack, Farmer, along with his friend Norick and his brother-in-law Bastian, fights off the Krug but fails to save Zeph, who gets killed by Gallian via a Krug avatar. Solana and other Stonebridge inhabitants are taken prisoner. King Konreid, Commander Tarish and a company of Ehb's army arrives at Stonebridge to survey the damage and recruit others to join their army. Merick, another Magus who serves Konreid, tries to learn of Farmer's identity when he notices Norick, who he believes he's seen before. Farmer, Norick and Bastian set off on their own to find Solana. Meanwhile, Merick's daughter Muriella, who fell in love with Gallian, ends her romance with him after seeing his dark nature and realizing that he only trained her power so he can take it away. She confesses to her father, who believes that her love for Gallian has created an imbalance of their powers in Gallian's favor. Meanwhile, Konreid's selfish and immature nephew Duke Fallow is in league with Gallian and he seeks to take his uncle's place. He attempts to poison Konreid and takes a company of Ehb soldiers for his own. Soon after, Konreid heals and leads his army to go and fight Gallian's forces. Going through Sedgwick Forest, Farmer and his companions encounter the reclusive nymphs led by Elora, who leads them out of the forest. When they attempt to rescue Solana from the Krug, Farmer gets knocked out and Norick and Bastian get captured. When Farmer is getting hanged by another one of Gallian's avatars, he kills the avatar, frees himself and is rescued by Merick. Farmer is taken to Konreid and his army's camp, where Merick reveals that Farmer is Konreid's long lost son and his real name is Camden Konreid. He explains that many years ago, a young Farmer was present during a battle at a place known as Oxley Pass, where he was found by Norick. Norick was considered to be the adoptive father but Farmer was cared for by Stonebridge's inhabitants and was kept safe from all the chaos that ravaged Ehb. Konreid and Farmer both disapprove of Merick's claims. Konreid catches Duke in his treachery, which leaves Duke only his personal guard as the company turns from him and joins the rest of the army. Soon after, a battle erupts between Ehb's army and the Krug. Ehb's army, along with Farmer, eventually gain the upper hand and force the Krug to retreat, but Duke succeeds in mortally wounding Konreid. After the battle, Konreid and Farmer learn that they both share similar knowledge as Konreid declares Farmer his son with his dying breath and dies. Meanwhile, Tarish challenges Duke to a duel. Tarish wins and Duke gets taken away. Farmer, who is now the new King, gets everybody ready for the next battle. Meanwhile, Norick, Bastian and Solana are taken to Gallian's lair at Christwind Hold. Norick gets killed while trying to fight back and Solana gets taken to Gallian, whose sense of royal blood reveals that Solana is pregnant with Farmer's second child. Going on a mission to infiltrate Gallian's lair, Farmer is joined by Merick, Muriella and Elora, who has sided with Ehb against Gallian, while Tarish and the remaining army hold off against the advancing Krug. Merick magically enters the lair and fights Gallian, who manages to kill Merick. Farmer and Muriella manage to get into the lair as well, but Elora stays behind. Farmer finds Solana and fights Gallian in a sword battle. When Gallian resorts to using his magic to gain the upper hand, he prepares to kill him until Solana stabs him in the back. Muriella arrives and tries to save Farmer but Gallian defeats Muriella by weakening her magic. With him wounded, Farmer quickly defeats Gallian by slitting his throat and killing him. Gallian's magic influence goes away and the Krug go back to being primitive, saving Bastian and the prisoners and Tarish and his battered forces. Having finally avenged his son, Farmer and Solana are happily reunited as the kingdom is saved.

Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum. Handing over the Tablets of the Law, Sistine Chapel alt= Cosimo Rosselli (1439-1507) was an Italian painter of the Quattrocento, active mainly in his birthplace of Florence, but also in Pisa earlier in his career in 1481-82 in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, where he painted some of the large frescoes on the side walls. Though generally regarded as a lesser talent in comparison to Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino and Domenico Ghirlandaio, who were all also active at the Sistine Chapel, Rosselli was still able to win large and important commission throughout his career, a testament to his high level of activity in his native Florence. Important local commissions include a fresco in the cloister of Santissima Annunziata, Florence and those in the Chapel of the Holy Blood inSant'Ambrogio, Florence. Biography Cosimo Rosselli was born in Florence. In 1460, at the age of fourteen, he became a pupil of Neri di Bicci, who also trained his cousin Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli.Piccoli Grand Musei, short biography. An early work, completed in 1469, is the panel of Saints Barbara, Matthias and John the Baptist, painted for the chapel of the German confraternity in the church of the Santissima Annunziata, Florence. Rosselli also painted a fresco in the Annunziata's forecourt and a lunette of the Annunciation in the adjoining convent. Rosselli was one of the painters called by Pope Sixtus IV to Rome in 1481 to fresco the sides walls of the Sistine Chapel, together with other masters including Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino and Domenico Ghirlandaio. Rosselli and his collaborators, which is said to have included the young Piero di Cosimo, executed two or three frescoes: the Descent from Mount Sinai, the Last Supper and the Sermon of the Mount. The Passage of the Red Sea was once attributed to him or Ghirlandaio but is actually by Biagio d'Antonio, who also assisted Rosselli on the Last Supper. Giorgio Vasari wrote in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects that, as opposed to the other painters who followed a common pattern in the size and style of the frescoes, Rosselli used brighter colors and a large amount of gold, which granted him the appreciation of the Pope (who, hints Vasari, was not a deep expert of art). Giorgio Vasari also mentioned other works by Rosselli, including the altarpiece of the Madonna and Child in Glory with Saints Augustine and Francis in the third chapel on the left of the nave of Sant'Ambrogio in Florence. In the same church is the Chapel of the Holy Blood with its frescoes by Rosselli, which Vasari praised highly, especially for a portrait of the young scholar Pico of Mirandola. The main scene in this chapel is a procession of the miracle-working chalice held in the very same church. The Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin has three pictures by Rosselli: a small Entombment of Christ and two altarpieces, one of the Madonna and Child with Angels, Saints and the Martyred Innocents and another of the Madonna of the Rosary. Rosselli's chief pupil was Piero di Cosimo but also trained Fra Bartolomeo, Mariotto Albertinelli and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere. According to Vasari, Rosselli died in 1484, but this is a mistake, as he was known to have been living on 25 November 1506.

Series outline Set in the 1860s, the series is a Western filmed in Australia, and stars Peter Graves as Christopher Cobb. The series is inspired by the life of Freeman Cobb, founder of Australia's first stagecoach line, Cobb and Co. The real Freeman Cobb did not carry a pistol, nor did he use a stockwhip to settle disputes. The series stands out from other television Westerns of its era in using only Australian actors as guest stars, rather than character actors from American Westerns. The series was created by Michael Noonan and Michael Plant, and produced by Maury Geraghty and Ben Fox at the Artransas Studios (owned by ATV), Sydney Australia. Post-production was completed in the United Kingdom. Cast and characters * Peter Graves as Christopher Cobb * Anthony Wickert as Dan Ledward Actors with memorable appearances and not included in episode list (below) include comedian George Wallace Jnr and Chuck Faulkner.

Noonan had created and written a British TV series shot in Australia called The Flying Doctor. Whiplash was a similar international production. The show was mostly financed by Lew Grade's ITC productions, but was aimed at the international market, leading to many Americans in key creative roles. Post production was done in the UK. Co- producing partners included Australia's Artransa Park Studios and Britain's ATV. =Casting= Star Peter Graves was best known at the time for the TV Western Fury. Australian actor Anthony Wickert played Cobb's employee, Dan Ledward. Several white actors appeared in blackface although there were a number of aboriginal actors cast as well. Production Filming started in October 1959. The majority of filming took place at Artransa Park Studios in French's Forest, Sydney, with location work at Scone in the Upper Hunter NSW. The producer was American Maury Geraghty with Ralph Smart a executive producer. Graves told the Sydney Morning Herald that > Nearly all the American Westerns are shot within 30 miles of Hollywood and a > lot of that scenery is becoming mighty familiar to TV viewers. Now this > scenery here Is refreshing ‚Äî something entirely new to folks overseas. > \\"We're trying to keep right away from that word 'Western' by labelling the > series a romantic adventure. In the film I don't wear a gun belt for > instance. When I have to use a pistol I stick it in my belt. \\"But don't get > the idea there's no action‚Äîthere's plenty, but we're trying to get away from > that old Western stuff. A mining town was built at Oxford Falls worth ¬£30,000 and the budget was a reported ¬£500,000. Because three separate countries were involved, production was initially difficult. The production team was restructured from episode six onwards, after which Geraghty and Smart were fired and Ben Fox was appointed producer with Leslie Harris as executive producer. Filming recommenced on 4 March 1960. The budget of the series was a reported ¬£650,000. In May 1960 it was reported the unit of 22 actors and crew had left Sydney for Alice Springs to film sequences over ten days including scenes at Ayers Rock, the Macdonnell Ranges and the Ormiston Gorge. By this stage ten episodes had been shot and the series sold to ATN Channel 7. Fox said that both American and British television groups were \\"likely to be very interested in buying the series.\\" By October Graves was back in the USA. He said they had a problem finding actors. \\"Those we got were very good, but there just wasn't enough of them,\\" he said. Lionel Ware was in charge of horses. Studio scenes were shot at Artransa Studios in Frenchs Forest, Sydney. Ben Fox later said \\"All the violence in Whiplash is motivated violence. There is a definite reason for, it. But even then you could hardly say at is a violent series.\\" He also said in November that the mining town set in Frenchs Forest was going to be turned into a Disney land style park and that he hoped to come back to make a feature film.

Blake and Sean Dickson (The Soup Dragons) were in The Faith Healers together, which also contained various members at different times Stevie Gray, Hugh McLaughlin, Brian Carson and Colin Murray to name but a few. Blake was a member of the Glasgow group, The Pretty Flowers, with school friend Duglas T. Stewart, Frances McKee, Janice Cochrane and Sean Dickson. After the group split Blake formed the Boy Hairdressers in 1986, the original lineup being really just Blake assisted by Dickson and Stewart. Later Blake was joined by Joe McAlinden, Jim Lambie and three future members of Teenage Fanclub Raymond McGinley, Francis Macdonald and Paul Quinn (after Macdonald's departure) ( Brendan O‚Äô Hare also in joined the group at this time) The group recorded one EP for 53rd and 3rd Records featuring three of Blake's compositions. In 1986, Blake also joined BMX Bandits, originally on drums and later moving to guitar. Blake became a key song writer for the Bandits co- authoring some of their best loved material including \\"Disco Girl\\", \\"Serious Drugs\\" and \\"Right Across the Street\\". Blake also joined Glasgow group The Clouds for a short stay, playing lead guitar on their single Get Out of My Dream. In 1989 Blake formed Teenage Fanclub with McGinley, later enlisting Francis Macdonald and Gerard Love to record their debut A Catholic Education.The album was primarily composed by Blake and included the anthemic \\"Everything Flows\\" (later covered by acts including Velvet Crush, Dinosaur Jr, Idlewild and Gallygows). The album was recorded in Glasgow back to back with the debut album of Blake's other group at that time, BMX Bandits, the ironically titled C86, which Blake also wrote much of the material for. Blake officially left the Bandits in 1991 after their Star Wars album but continues to be an occasional contributor to their records. Blake has found international fame and acclaim with Teenage Fanclub for his songwriting talents and vocal abilities in both lead and harmony roles. Blake's songs are melodic and great, and an appreciation and understanding of many musical genres. His best loved songs for Teenage Fanclub include \\" Straight and Narrow \\", \\"Alcoholiday\\", \\"Did I Say\\" and \\"Neil Jung\\". Blake has continued to contribute to projects without his main band, including one-off collaborations with Eugene Kelly as The Famous Monsters, and Francis MacDonald as Frank Blake. More recently, Blake has recorded and co-written material with Euros Childs, forming the indie superduo Jonny. Blake has also appeared on recordings by The Trash Can Sinatras, The Pastels, Kevin Ayers, Bill Wells, The Reindeer Section, Snowgoose, Yeon Gene and The Pearlfishers. Blake has produced recordings for Speedboat (featuring Finlay MacDonald), The Pearlfishers and 1990s. Blake has solo recordings on the albums Caroline Now! (a tribute album to The Beach Boys) and Ballads of the Book. In 2001, Blake stood down from being elected Rector of the University of Glasgow to make room for his friend, Belle and Sebastian's, Stuart Murdoch. In 2009, Blake moved to live with his Canadian wife in Kitchener, Ontario. He is currently collaborating with Joe Pernice in The New Mendicants. Their debut album, Into the Lime, was released in January 2014.\\"The New Mendicants ‚Äì the indie supergroup that begs to differ\\". The Irish Times, 17 January 2014. In 2014, Blake released How Many Glasgow, an album in collaboration with Jad Fair and Tenniscoats on the label Sweet Dreams Press. 2015 saw the release of the album Yes, a collaboration with Jad Fair as part of Fair's artist in residence project with Indianapolis label Joyful Noise Recordings. In 2018, Blake produced the debut (and only) album, Things That Roar, by Manchester band, The Beep Seals. The band was fronted by former Alfie guitarist, Ian Smith, and Jack Cooper, who went on to form several bands including Ultimate Painting and Mazes. Blake features prominently in the 2017 documentary Teenage Superstars.

A near-birth experience (also known as a pre-birth experience or pre-mortal experience) is an alleged recollected event which occurred before or during one's own birth, or during the pregnancy, an alleged remembering of one's own pre-existence, or an alleged encounter with the unborn child (usually via dream) experienced by relatives or close family friends. Under this usage, the term \\"near-birth experience\\" is analogous to the term \\"near-death experience.\\"Blackmore, Susan. (2002). Out-of-Body Experience. In Michael Shermer. The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience. ABC-CLIO. pp. 164-170. History Psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, in 1954 researched LSD in Prague, and after 1967 he explored ketamine, and other methods for exhibiting non-ordinary states of consciousness like holotropic breathing. Grof concluded that some near-death experiences are virtual recollection of birth memories, actual re-experiencing of parts of the process in symbolic form, and \\"movement towards the light tunnel being a memory or symbolic re-experience of being born: a memory of the 'near-birth experience'.\\" According to Grof the NDE reflects memories of the birth process with the tunnel representing the birth canal.French, Chris. (2005). Near-Death Experiences in Cardiac Arrest Survivors. Progress in Brain Research 150: 351-367. In 1979, science writer Carl Sagan also supported the hypothesis that near-death experiences are memories of birth. The parapsychologist Barbara Honegger (1983) wrote that the out-of-body experience may be based on a rebirth fantasy or reliving of the birth process based on reports of tunnel- like passageways and a cord-like connection by some OBErs which she compared to an umbilical cord.Honegger, Barbara. (1983). The OBE as a Near-Birth Experience. In Roll, W. G., Beloff, J., and White, R. A. (Eds.). Research in Parapsychology. Scarecrow Press. pp. 230-231. The hypothesis was refuted in a statistical study by Susan Blackmore.Davidson, Keay. (2000). Carl Sagan: A Life. Wiley. p. 416. Criticism Psychologist Chris French has written \\"the experience of being born is only very superficially similar to the NDE\\" and the hypothesis has been refuted as it is common for those born by caesarean section to experience a tunnel during the NDE. Psychologist and skeptic Susan Blackmore has claimed that the near-birth experience hypothesis is \\"pitifully inadequate to explain the NDE. For a start the newborn infant would not see anything like a tunnel as it was being born.\\"Blackmore, Susan. (1991). Near- Death Experiences: In or out of the body?. Skeptical Inquirer 16: 34-45. Notable skeptic Michael Shermer has also criticized the hypothesis concluding \\"there is no evidence for infantile memories of any kind. Furthermore, the birth canal does not look like a tunnel and besides the infant's head is normally down and its eyes are closed.\\"Shermer, Michael. (1997).

It lies about south-east of Chester High Cross, south of Liverpool and south west of Manchester. It is almost continuous with the village of Rowton to the north west and that in turn is almost continuous with Christleton.Ordnance Survey Map, 2005, 1:25000scale. Sheet 266 (\\"Wirral and Chester/Caer\\") According to the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 1,587. The village's Anglican church is dedicated to St. Peter. The village has an Evangelical church and there is a Methodist church on the edge of the village in the parish of Rowton. The village has a post office, a number of shops, a takeaway, hairdressers, a primary school and a pub called the Black Dog. The village is home to the outdoor children's adventure attraction, the Crocky Trail. The Waverton Good Read Award was founded in 2003 for first-time UK novelists. Waverton Business Park is also located in the village, off the A41. The Shropshire Union Canal (originally Chester Canal) runs through the middle of Waverton. The village had a railway station on the North Wales Coast Line until it closed in the 1960s. The line, which runs between Chester, Crewe, and North Wales, is named Route 22 on Network Rail's 2006 reorganisation. Services on this line are offered by Transport for Wales, and, as the \\"London to Holyhead\\" spur of the West Coast Main Line route, by Avanti West Coast. The train station is now a bus depot run by Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire. The village also has a large junior football team, AFC Waverton, which competes in both the Chester and District Junior Football League and the Ellesmere Port Junior Football League. History The settlement was named Wavretone in the Domesday Book, where it was said to be in the Dudestan Hundred. The name was first given as Waverton in 1260, having been called Waueretone in 1150, and Wauertone in 1100. The origin of the name is not certain. The Church of St Peter's nave has a roof that has been dated to 1665. The tower, on the west end of the building, is built in the Perpendicular Style and possess a nineteenth-century pyramidal roof. Although the church was restored in the 1880s, the chancel's timber framing, the windows, and clerestory are all original. New residential developments led to a significant expansion of the village in the 20th Century. Until the late 1970s there was a chemical works located on the canal in the centre of Waverton. Residents of the village tend to be commuters to Liverpool and Manchester with easy access to the M53 motorway and M56 motorway, as well as into Chester city centre.

Tjurunga often had a wide and indeterminate native significance. They may be used variously in sacred ceremonies, as bullroarers, in sacred ground paintings, in ceremonial poles, in ceremonial headgear, in sacred chants and in sacred earth mounds. Meaning Generally speaking, tjurunga denote sacred stone or wooden objects possessed by private or group owners together with the legends, chants, and ceremonies associated with them. They were present among the Arrernte, the Luritja, the Kaitish, the Unmatjera, and the Illpirra. These items are most commonly oblong pieces of polished stone or wood. Some of these items have hair or string strung through them and were named \\"bull roarers\\" by Europeans. Upon each tjurunga is a totem of the group to which it belongs. Tjurunga are highly sacred, in fact, they are considered so sacred that only a few are able to see them and likewise it is considered sacrilegious to publish a picture of them. Durkheim suggests that the name \\"churinga\\" is normally a noun, but can also be used as an adjective meaning \\"sacred\\". The term Tjurunga was translated by Carl Strehlow to mean something similar to secret and personal. Tju means \\"hidden\\" or \\"secret\\", and runga means \\"that which is personal to me\\". Kempe argued against this translation and suggested that Tju means \\"great\\", \\"powerful\\", or \\"sacred\\" and that runga did not translate into personal ownership. Ownership The ownership of sacred tjurunga amongst the Arrernte groups was determined largely by \\"the conception site\\" of every individual member of a patrilineal totemic clan. Because these relics are considered sacred, their availability is limited to a small number of people. During the early 20th century and before, only initiated males were able to see or touch these sacred objects. Women and uninitiated males were not allowed to touch them or see them, except from a far distance. The tjurunga were kept separately from the rest of the clan in a sacred location that was also unavailable to the uninitiated and women. While some theorists, such as Strehlow, have suggested these relics are amongst the very few forms of property which may be owned legitimately by individual persons in Central Australia, Durkheim and Kempe contend that the tjurunga cannot be owned by an individual. For example, Durkheim writes, \\"As concerns the meaning of the word runga, that seems very doubtful. The ceremonies of the Emu belong to all the members of the Emu clan; all can participate in them; they are not the personal property of any member.\\" Religious aspects In many myths the ancestors themselves are said to have used them and stored them away as their most treasured possessions. Such myths emphasise the life-holding magical properties of these tjurungas. The ancestor regarded his tjurunga as portions of his own being; and is always worried that strangers might come and rob him of the very essence of his life. Accordingly, legends abound with stories of theft and robbery, and the very fierce vengeance exacted. Tjuringa were thought to have magical properties. They would be rubbed on the body to confer sacredness onto the subject and to do things such as heal wounds. While tjuringa were useful to the individual, the clan's collective fate was also considered to be tied up with the items. After all, it was the totemic image that provided representation for the group on the tjuringa. The acquisition of sufficient knowledge leading to possession of personal tjurunga was long, difficult and sometimes extremely painful. Practices differed amongst the various groups. Ted Strehlow describes how the men from the Northern, Southern and Western Arrernte groups were put on probation for several years after their last initiations. Ceremonial significance The tjurunga were visible embodiments of some part of the fertility of the great ancestor of the totem in question. The body of the ancestor merely undergoes a transmutation into something that will weather all the assaults of time, change and decay. Stone tjurunga were thought to have been made by the ancestors themselves. The wooden tjurunga made by the old men are symbolical of the actual tjurunga which \\"cannot be found\\". These \\"man- made\\" tjurunga were accepted without reservation as sacred objects. At the time of receiving his tjurunga-body a young man may be twenty-five years of age. He will often be thirty-five or forty years of age before the most sacred chants and ceremonies that are linked with it have passed into his possession. As he grows older and continues to demonstrate his worthiness, he receives an ever-increasing share in the tjurunga owned by his own totemic clan. Eventually he may become a member of the assembly of senior Lawmen who are honoured trustees for the ancient traditions of the whole clan. In 1933, Strehlow noted that after the advent of white men to Central Australia, the young men employed by the foreign intruders were watched very closely by the old men of their group. In many cases, unless the young men were outstandingly generous in their gifts towards their elders, no ceremonies or chants of power and importance were handed on to this unworthy younger generation. With the death of the old men such chants and ceremonies passed into oblivion. Acquisition of knowledge The old men would carefully note a young man's conduct. He had to be respectful towards his elders; he had to be attentive to their advice in all things. He would know the value of silence in ceremonial matters; no account of his past experiences could be spoken within the hearing of women and children. His own marriage had to conform to the laws of the group. One day the old men, sitting in a circle, would call him in to sit down in their midst. They began to chant. One man told Strehlow: > The old men seized my hand. They all struck up the chant-verse: :With fierce > eyes, with glowing eyes, they seize the thumb; > :With fierce eyes, with glowing eyes, they rip off the nail. An old man > produced a sharp kangaroo bone (ntjala). He stabbed my thumb with it, pushed > the bone deeply underneath the nail. He drew the point out; the rest kept up > the chant. He thrust it under the nail in a different place. He gradually > loosened the thumbnail. It was slippery with blood. I almost shrieked with > pain; the torment was unbearable. I have not forgotten it: the pain was not > slight; it was exceedingly great. When the nail had been loosened, he took a > sharp opossum tooth, forced it into the living flesh through the base of the > thumb-nail, and tore the nail off from behind. Blood spurted over his hand. > The man chanted: :They rip off the nail, they tear off the nail; > :Blood flows like a river, rushes along like a river. Then they seized my > left hand and removed the thumb-nail in like manner. Nowadays we make a > great concession to the young men in our group. We no longer tear off their > finger-nails. The price is too high; we give the tjurunga to them at a much > lower cost. Besides, the young men of the present generation are no longer > hardy enough to endure such pain. Relationship to historical research These sacred relics were of high interest to early European anthropologists and sociologists, who were studying the nature of totemic religion and the sacred. Scholars such as Spencer, Gillen, Strehlow, Kempe and Durkheim all studied tjurunga. Durkheim discusses the nature of tjurunga throughout his seminal work The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1912). He considered the tjurunga to be an archetype of the sacred item.

Originally called simply Stanmore, it was opened on 18 December 1890 by the Harrow and Stanmore Railway, a company owned by the hotel millionaire Frederick Gordon, as the terminus of the Stanmore branch line, a short branch line running north from Harrow & Wealdstone. Trains were operated by the London & North Western Railway (LNWR). The station was located on the south side of the junction of Gordon Avenue and Old Church Lane (the section north of the junction was originally named Station Road), and was noted for its architectural style, designed to resemble a village church, including a short spire. It closed to passenger traffic in 1952. History In 1882 the entrepreneur and hotelier Frederick Gordon purchased Bentley Priory, a large country house near Stanmore. He planned to open it up as a country retreat for wealthy guests. Known as \\"The Napoleon of the Hotel World\\", Gordon was a successful international businessman, and had earned his millions through his international hotel chain. At the time, Stanmore was a remote, rural location, and Gordon built his own railway line from Harrow in an attempt to attract affluent clientele to his country hotel. He negotiated a contract with the LNWR, the railway company that owned the mainline at Harrow, to operate the Stanmore line on his behalf. Gordon's scheme met with some local opposition and he was forced to re-route the railway line further east to mitigate objections. The site for a terminus was selected in Old Church Lane in Stanmore. To allay the concerns of the local inhabitants ‚Äî and to appeal to his well-heeled customers ‚Äî Gordon commissioned an architect to design an elegant station building that resembled a Gothic- style English country church. The Stanmore branch line opened to great fanfare on 18 December 1890. The connection to the main line at Harrow & Wealdstone station faced away from London preventing through trains operating without a reversal; the passenger service was thus operated as a shuttle from Harrow and Wealdstone to Stanmore, normally run as a push‚Äìpull train. =Decline= The opening in 1932 by the Metropolitan Railway of its own Stanmore station about to the north-east (later served by the Bakerloo line and now by the Jubilee line), introduced a rapid, direct service to the West End and the City of London. This presented strong competition to the Village station, now operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). An intermediate station on the LMS branch line was constructed at Belmont in order to attract more passengers, opening on 12 September 1932. Stanmore station was renamed Stanmore Village on 25 September 1950 in order to distinguish it from the nearby Underground station. Declining receipts led to the passenger service being withdrawn on 15 September 1952, but a shuttle service continued between Belmont and Harrow. The London Transport 158 bus route provided alternative services. A daily freight train continued using the line beyond Belmont. =Closure= In 1963 the entire Stanmore branch line was marked for closure as part of the Beeching cuts. On 6 July 1964 the goods line from Belmont to Stanmore was shut; by then the run-round loop had been removed so goods wagons were propelled from Harrow and Wealdstone station. The last passenger train on the remaining section ran from Belmont to Harrow on 5 October 1964. The railway tracks were taken up in 1966 and the remaining trackbed was purchased by Harrow Council. Sections of the former line were sold off and built upon, but most of the line was left to grow wild. The Stanmore Village platform buildings were demolished in the 1970s for the construction of a road of new houses, September Way, which was built along part of the track alignment. Despite its architectural merit, Stanmore Village station was allowed to fall into ruin. Attempts were made to preserve the building, but it suffered from neglect and vandalism. In 1969 it was redeveloped by a property developer, who removed most of the Gothic architectural features and converted it into a residential property, which still stands today on Gordon Avenue. A plaque mounted on the wall of the house indicates the site of the station. Architecture Stanmore was an affluent and conservative community, and Great Stanmore Parish Council stipulated that Frederick Gordon's new station building should be of a high-quality design that would blend in with its surroundings. The station was built in a Gothic style, deliberately design to resemble a small English church complete with a square tower topped with a spire and decorated with gargoyles, a large clock on top of a buttressed Gothic portico, and an ecclesiastical-style entrance door. The station had a single platform covered by a cast-iron and glass canopy. The supporting pillars bore the coat of arms of the Gordon family: three boars' heads surrounded by thistles and roses. Filming location Stanmore Village station was used as a filming location for several productions including The Gold Express (1955), which starred Vernon Gray and Ivy St. Helier, and a BBC television play, The Sun and I(1955).

Work in social studies of finance emphasises the social and cultural dimensions of financial activities, but focuses also on technical and economic dimensions such as pricing and trading. History Financial markets have been an object for sociological inquiry since, at least, Max Weber‚Äôs Die B√∂rse. The raise of quantitative financial theory in financial economics from the 1950s onwards has led to an academic specialization on financial markets rather focused on economic modeling, and poorly attentive to sociological aspects. In the 1980s, a number of economic sociologists developed empirical investigation on the social structure and cultural characteristics of financial markets, especially in the US. Such pioneering researcher included contributions from Wayne E. Baker, Mitchel Y. Abolafia and Charles W. Smith, and was based on methods such as ethnographic observation or social network analysis. In the 1990s, a number of researchers from the field of science and technology studies such as Karin Knorr-Cetina and Donald A. MacKenzie started also developing empirical research in this area, with close attention to the role of expert knowledge and technology in financial activities. Main topics Research topics in social studies of finance include the cultural world and work habits of traders and other professionals in financial markets, the globalization and regulation of financial services, the processes of innovation in the financial industry and the problems of risk and uncertainty that characterize such processes.

The group recorded three albums for Atlantic Records: Grab It! in 1988, Drop That Bottom in 1989 (which led The Source to name the group Hip-Hop Goddesses of the Month), and Groovy in 1991. Early years The Lady Tigra (Rachel de Rougemont) and Bunny D. (Elana Cager) met in high school, and regularly attended Skylight Express, a teen-night dance club in Kendall that featured live performances by national hip-hop artists (including LL Cool J and Salt-N-Pepa), as well as local Miami bass music and artists (such as 2 Live Crew and the Gucci Crew). They were featured dancers on the syndicated TV show Miami Teen Express that was taped and aired every week throughout South Florida, Atlanta, Metro New York, and was produced by Douglas Productions which produced a string of local and syndicated cable programs. Lady Tigra and Trikki Nikki (I Touched This) were best friends and wrote rhymes together when one fateful night they met a kindred spirit in Bunny D. at Skylight Express and invited her onto the stage. The girls quickly struck up a friendship when they discovered their shared love of all things hip-hop. Tigra was an amateur graffiti artist, poet, and break-dancer from Hollis, Queens who wrote rhymes around her Haitian, French and American roots. Bunny D was a classically trained dancer who went to a performing arts school and also wrote hip-hop lyrics. The duo formed a group called XTC and would battle boys during their lunch period, ultimately bringing their underground street and art school polish together to form L'Trimm. Female emcees were a rarity at the time and the girls soon gained the attention of local rapper Mighty Rock of the group Double Deuce, who used to drive them home from school. One afternoon, Mighty Rock needed to stop by the Hot Productions studios. During the meeting, Tigra and Bunny went into a recording booth and began rhyming for fun. Paul Klein of Hot Productions caught the girls and employed Larry Davis to construct some hook-oriented tracks for the group, around the girls' pre- written rhymes. Trikki Nikki went to a different high-school by that time so the trio was destined to be a duo but she was later brought in to do her solo record, a comeback to MC Hammer's \\"Can't Touch This\\" which received local accolades. Tigra was 15 years old and Bunny was 17 years old when the girls signed with Hot Productions. Group history The group took its new name from a then-popular designer brand of blue jeans (Trim) and added the L' prefix to give it a French feel. The song \\"Grab It!\\" became a local hit and was followed by an album of the same name. Shapiro, Peter (2005) \\"L'Trimm\\", in The Rough Guide to Hip-Hop, Rough Guides, Shortly after, \\"Cars with the Boom\\", an ode to subwoofers, reached #54 on the Billboard Hot 100 and a national tour followed. Atlantic Records picked up the group's first album and signed a deal to distribute L'Trimm's second album, Drop That Bottom, which included a remix of \\"Grab It!\\". The album was a minor success. Interest in \\"Cars with the Boom\\" was later renewed in mid-2020 due to the influence of TikTok. L'Trimm became dissatisfied with the direction their music was taking once co-writers were put in charge of producing their third album, Groovy. At the same time, Miami indie labels began to speculate that the Miami bass sound would never break through to mainstream national audiences. As Hot Productions began to look for new creative inspiration, the group hired representation in the form of managers and lawyers. A stalemate was reached and the group abandoned the sessions of its third album, Groovy. With plenty of vocal outtakes left in the studio from previous sessions, Hot Productions continued creating the album without the artists' input. The resulting album had more of a house and new jack swing sound, sold poorly, failed to find the new market for which it was aiming and was poorly received by critics. Unwilling to compromise their creative input, unable to score another hit with the label's new sound and with its youthful pop-rap style waning in popularity, L'Trimm disbanded. Life after L'Trimm Bunny D became a nurse working in the fields of Geriatrics, Labor and Delivery, and Special Needs Children and Adults. She has four children and is married to La Kidd from Philadelphia's Tuff Crew, which released the 1989 hit \\"My Parta Town\\". They met while touring together. Bunny is also writing a series of children's books and is designing a clothing line. After a few years of hosting events in Miami's burgeoning music, arts, fashion, and club scenes on South Beach, Lady Tigra moved back to New York City, where she managed nightclubs. In 2008, she moved to Los Angeles and released her first solo project, Please Mr. Boombox (which featured a guest track by MC Lyte), to great critical review and leading to MySpace putting the first track on their sign-in page as video of the month. Tigra wrote and performed the jingle on the Pinkberry website and appeared on Nickelodeon's award-winning children's show Yo Gabba Gabba, where she performed Debbie Deb's \\"When I Hear Music.\\" In 2010, she collaborated with writer/director J.B. Ghuhman Jr. and music producer Yeti Beats on the soundtrack of the award- winning movie Spork, which had heavy references to 1990s pop-culture. In 2016 The Lady Tigra appeared in the American documentary film 808 directed, co- produced and co-written by Alexander Dunn, co-produced by Arthur Baker, Craig Kallman, and Alex Noyer and co-written by Luke Bainbridge. In 2018 Tigra appeared in the first episode of the second season of the Peabody Award- winning Netflix docu-series \\"Hip-Hop Evolution, The Southern Way.\\" She gave commentary on the roots of Southern Hip-Hop alongside other pioneers of the sound Uncle Luke, Disco Rick, Trick Daddy, Brother Marquis, Mr. Mixx, The Geto Boys, and UKG. In 2019 Lady Tigra began a collaboration with Spencer Nezey (Her Majesty and the Wolves, Jupiter Rising) called Tigra & Spencer, releasing their first single \\"Can't Walk Away\\" in December of the same year. The Lady Tigra has also acted in and guest appeared on many projects and remains active in NY, Miami, and LA's underground Music, Fashion, DJ, Art and Club scenes. L'Trimm has not released further material. Although the group disbanded, they remain close friends with Lady Tigra often referencing her days in L'Trimm with Bunny D. as one of her influences. In 2008, \\"Cars with the Boom\\" was ranked number 95 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. In 2016, \\"Cars with the Boom\\" was ranked 100 in Rolling Stone Magazine's Top 100 Hip Hop Songs of all Time. In 2019 L'Trimm appeared in the Boogaloo Shrimp Documentary, a film about Michael Chambers, the American dancer and actor also known as ‚ÄúBoogaloo Shrimp.‚Äù Michael is most renowned for his role as ‚ÄúTurbo‚Äù in the 1984 cult movie ‚ÄúBreakin‚Äô‚Äù and its sequel ‚ÄúBreakin‚Äô 2: Electric Boogaloo.‚Äù In 2020, L'Trimm's song \\"Cars That Go Boom\\" went viral on the social media app TikTok. The part of the song that went viral was \\"But then he turned a little button and the car went boom. We like the cars, the cars that go boom\\". On June 3, the compilation album \\"Cars That Go Boom\\" was released. Discography =Albums= *1988: Grab It!

The team compiled a total of four wins throughout its history. The team debuted in 1995 with Jones' son Buckshot driving. Jones made his debut at The Milwaukee Mile with Longhorn Steakhouse sponsorship. Jones ran a total of nine races that season, finishing ninth at South Boston Speedway. The following season, they ran a total of eighteen races with Aquafresh sponsoring. Jones won his first career race at Milwaukee and a pole at North Carolina Speedway, finishing 25th in the final points. He failed to win another race in 1997, but he finished a career-best seventh in points, and made his Winston Cup debut at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The team qualified 32nd but finished last due to a wreck by Jones early in the race. In 1998, Bayer/Alka-Seltzer became the team's new primary sponsor, and Jones picked up his second career win at the Gumout Long Life Formula 200, but dropped to ninth in points. Buckshot Racing also ran five Cup races under a partnership with Stavola Brothers Racing, and had an eighth-place finish at Dover International Speedway. Jones moved up to Winston Cup full-time in 1999, racing the 00 but without major sponsorship. Larry Pearson replaced him in the team's Busch Series operation, with Cheez-It sponsorship. Jones struggled running the Cup series, and after several DNQs, he left Cup to replace Pearson in the Busch car, who had only one top-ten finish. Jones had two tenth-place finishes out of nineteen starts. In 2000, Jones won his final pole at Michigan International Speedway and improved to 21st in the standings. Jones returned to Cup for Petty Enterprises in 2001, and Todd Bodine was hired as the team's new driver. Despite driving without major sponsorship and switching to Chevrolet, Bodine won two of the first three races of the season. When sponsorship forced the team to cut back to a part-time schedule, Buckshot and Tim Fedewa returned to drive a limited races with Georgia Pacific funding, posting four top-ten finishes between them. Jason Schuler also drove the No. 04 for a pair of races, his best finishes of 36th. The lack of funding caused Buckshot to sell the team in 2002.

Built between 1964 and 1971, the 1,600 megawatt capacity power station was made up of eight 200MW units, and supplied up to 25% of Victoria's base load electricity and more than 5% of Australia's total electricity demand. It was a 'subcritical' pulverized coal-fired boiler. The station was listed as the least carbon efficient power station in the OECD in a 2005 report by WWF Australia, making it one of the most polluting power stations in the world. At 1.56 tonnes of CO2 for each megawatt hour of electricity, it was 50% more polluting than the average black coal power station in New South Wales or Queensland. Hazelwood emitted 14% of Victoria's annual greenhouse gas emissions and 3% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. International Power plc purchased Hazelwood Power Station and the adjoining mine from the Victorian Government in 1996 with an expected 40-year life. In 2005, the Bracks Labor Government approved an environmental effects statement (EES) that allowed Hazelwood to relocate a road and a section of the Morwell river to allow access to an additional 43 million tonnes of coal in addition to that allowed under the mining licence boundaries set at the time of privatisation. This was estimated to provide sufficient coal for the plant to operate to at least 2030 (prior to decommissioning plans). The EES also capped its expected total greenhouse output at 445 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over its life, after which Hazelwood may have been made to cease operation. Hazelwood was jointly owned by Engie (formerly GDF Suez), with a 72% share and Mitsui & Co. with a 28% share. In 2014, Hazelwood employed 495 staff directly and on average 300 contractors. On 3 November 2016, Engie announced that the entire Hazelwood plant would be closed at the end of March 2017 giving five months notice of the closure. The power station closed in March 2017.What we'll do to keep the lights on post Hazelwood: grid operator History A map of the major towns and coal-fired power stations in the Latrobe Valley. Hazelwood Power Station seen at night, 2016. Development of the brown coal reserves at Morwell was started by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) in 1949 as the 'Morwell Project', which included the Morwell open cut mine, and the Morwell briquette works. The Morwell Interconnecting Railway linked the power station and briquette works to the Yallourn open cut mine until 1993. Hazelwood Power Station was approved in 1959, and was to consist of six generating units, giving a total of 1,200 MW of generating capacity. The first unit was to enter service in 1964, and the sixth in 1971. Growing electricity demand saw a review carried out by the SECV in 1963, with commissioning of the generating units moved forward to 1969. Additional capacity was provided when in 1965 two additional generating units at Hazelwood were approved, to be commissioned in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Hazelwood relied on brown coal deposits from the nearby Morwell open cut mine. In 2003, the plant used of coal, while a further of coal was supplied from the Morwell mine to Morwell Power Station Energy Brix Australia 2.5 km North East of Hazelwood Power Station. =Privatisation= Hazelwood Power Station and associated mine were privatised by the Kennett government in 1996 after many years of downsizing under a 'structural efficiency' model undertaken by the then state Liberal government. It was sold for 2.35 billion, and it operated as 'IPR-GDF SUEZ Hazelwood', an Australian public company, which was owned by UK company, International Power plc (91.8% share)- part of the GDF SUEZ group - and the Commonwealth Bank Group (the remaining 8.2%). The business office was near Morwell, east of Melbourne. Prior to January 2011, IPR-GDF SUEZ Hazelwood had been known as International Power Hazelwood and Hazelwood Power before that. After privatisation the new owners engaged in capital investment, with 800 million invested in Hazelwood since 1996, such as replacement of boilers, rotors, turbines and the completion of an 85 million project to reduce dust emissions by 80%. If Hazelwood had not been sold to private interests, activist groups say the SECV would have shut the station down in 2005. =EES approval= Before privatisation the power station was due to be decommissioned by the SECV by 2005, as had older plants at Newport and Yallourn. However Hazelwood had its mining licence realigned by the Victorian Government along with EES approvals to move a river and a road on 6 September 2005. This agreement ensured security of coal supply to the plant until at least 2030 by allowing access to 43 million tonnes of brown coal deposits in a realignment of Hazelwood's mining licence boundaries that were originally set in 1996. Hazelwood returned over 160 million tonnes of coal to the State Government as part of that agreement. The agreement required Hazelwood to reduce its estimated emissions by and capped its total greenhouse output at of carbon dioxide over its life, after which point it may have been made to cease operation. However credits for investment in renewable energy and low emission technology was expected to allow the business to operate within the cap and extend its life. In spite of this, the station was still decommissioned. Hazelwood's West Field development involved completing a new section of the Strzelecki Highway, replacing over of the Morwell River from an old concrete pipe into a natural open channel riverine setting, and acquiring privately owned land which was earmarked for future coal supply. Environment Victoria, Greenpeace and Australian Conservation Foundation opposed the development approvals, while business groups such as Minerals Council of Australia, VECCI, Aust Industry Group and Institute of Public Affairs welcomed the Government's decision. =Closure and decommissioning= Hazelwood shutting down Unit 1 for the last time on 29 March 2017. The thick plume of smoke is caused by a combination of the electrostatic precipitators switching off automatically during the shut down to eliminate the risk of them igniting, and what's left of the auxiliary fuel (briquettes) stored on site being fed into the boiler to empty their stores. Hazelwood's coal supply would likely have run out around 2009 without the 2005 coal mine extension. This extension, and the associated environmental impacts, have led to significant criticism by environmental groups, and civil disobedience actions (see below). During 2011 and 2012, the Australian Government considered a Contract for Closure program to complement the Clean Energy Act policy. Hazelwood would likely have been closed under this program had it been pursued. However, this program was scrapped in September 2012 and no plants were closed. On 3 November 2016, Engie announced that Hazelwood would be closed by the end of March 2017, citing the company's transformational policy of investing solely in low-carbon and renewable energy, as well lower energy prices and oversupply within Victoria. In May 2016, CEO Isabelle Kocher said the company was reviewing its remaining coal plants one by one and would close those with the most outdated technology. The largest shareholder in Engie is the French government, which owns 33% of the company. The French Environment Minister said ENGIE would 'disengage' from Hazelwood power station during a documentary that aired on French TV in May 2016. The Minister's response came after receiving a petition about the Hazelwood mine fire from Environment Victoria. The decommissioning and rehabilitation of the site is estimated to cost at least $743 million, six times the previously predicted amount. This includes $439 million to rehabilitate the mine, and $304 million to demolish the plant and restore the surrounding area. This is in addition to $324 million payable by the owners for redundancy and leave entitlements over the two years after closure, bringing the total cost of closing the plant to almost $1.1 billion. In the lead up to the closure, there was insecurity around the numbers of Hazelwood workers Engie would keep employing in the decommissioning and rehabilitation processes, the redundancy packages offered, as well as the future of other workers and the local community in and around Morwell directly and indirectly impacted by the closure of the power station. On 27 March 2017, units #8, #6 and #4 were permanently shut down, followed by units #2, #7 and #5 on 28 March 2017, and units #3 and #1 on 29 March 2017. Unit #1 was shut down last at 4.56pm. It was chosen to be last because Unit 1 was the first Hazelwood generating unit to come into operation on 30 November 1964.Rowe, Trevor (29 March 2017). \\"End of generation at Hazelwood\\" (Press release). Engie. Retrieved 30 March 2017. Decommissioning of mine and power station plant and equipment was expected to take 12 months. In a press release on the subject of the closure, Engie in Australia's Chief Executive, Alex Keisser, acknowledged the contributions of past and present Hazelwood employees, and the role the power station has played in the Latrobe Valley. \\"While Friday will be the end of an era and a very sad day for everyone who has had an involvement with Hazelwood over the past 52 years, it should also be a very proud day,\\" Keisser said. \\"The decision to close Hazelwood was extremely difficult and was made only after we investigated all options to keep the business open. While it was state-of-the-art when it opened in 1964, it has now reached the end of its productive life, lasting far longer than anyone would have anticipated when its life began. Our employees past and present, as well as contractors, local suppliers and businesses, and the broader Latrobe Valley community have all played their part in ensuring that Hazelwood has been a key player in the nation's electricity system over that time. Victoria should be very proud that Hazelwood has continued operating for more than 50 years, producing the electricity that has under-pinned the state's economic development and well- being.\\" The eight chimneys at the power station were demolished on 25 May 2020.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIhTOHBH4mc Environmental impacts Unit number three is coming back online following a shut down, resulting in a plume of visible smoke due to the electrostatic precipitators being offline for the duration of the start-up.

The WWF reported that the power station produced of CO2 per megawatt-hour of electricity generated in 2004 (official result was 1.55), which was a reduction of 6.6% from the 1996 levels of 1.66 Mt/TWh when the plant was privatised. This is still 50% more polluting than the average black coal power station in NSW or Queensland. Hazelwood emitted up to 15% of Victoria's annual greenhouse gas emissions and 3% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions before closure. With a 60% increase in power generation since 1996, Hazelwood averaged up to of carbon dioxide each year and, after Loy Yang A Power station, was the second highest emitter in the Latrobe Valley until 2015. Hazelwood had been the site of two carbon capture trials to lower its CO2 emissions (see below). In late 2008, International Power stated the financial viability of the power station would be in question under a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme (ETS), unless the company received significant compensation. =Water usage= In 2005, of water was consumed per of power generated. Cooling water for the power station was supplied by the Hazelwood Pondage, built for this purpose in the 1960s. The pondage is supplied with water from the Moondarra Reservoir and runoff pumped from the adjacent mine. Within the mine, water was sprayed onto the coal surfaces to reduce the chance of fire and to suppress fugitive dust. Public access to the pondage for sailing, boating and other recreational water sports is permitted. Cichlids and other tropical fish that were released into the lake by the public have established populations, including Convict cichlids (Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus) and the African cichlid spotted tilapia (Tilapia mariae). Other fish include carp, goldfish (Carassius auratus), Gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki), and the native short-finned eel (Anguilla australis) and Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni). = Pollutants = Hazelwood Power Station as seen from an aircraft in 2009. In a 2007-2008 report, the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) rated the power station's polychlorinated dioxins and furans as \\"high 100\\", hydrochloric acid as \\"high 87\\", oxides of nitrogen as \\"medium 57\\", particulate matter 2.5 Œºm as \\"low 21\\", and boron & compounds as \\"low 15\\". The 2005-2006 NPI data showed that Hazelwood released of boron and compounds into the air and into water. Also released into the air: hydrochloric acid, of oxides of nitrogen, of particulate matter 10 Œºm, and of polychlorinated dioxins and furans. Many pollutants are not measured. Air pollution from the normal operations of Hazelwood alone had been estimated to kill at least 18 people a year in Gippsland, and make many more people sick. The estimated annual health burden on the community of Hazelwood's air pollution was $100 million each year, calculated using methodology developed by the US National Academy of Sciences. = Coal mine fire = A fire, commonly referred to as the Hazelwood Coal Mine Fire, started at the mine on 9 February 2014 and was officially considered controlled on 10 March 2014. The Chief Officer of the Country Fire Authority described the fire as \\"one of the largest, longest running and most complex fires in the State's history.\\" Thousands of residents in nearby towns were affected by smoke and ash from the fire. On 28 February the Chief Health Officer of Victoria advised the vulnerable groups of people in Morwell South to temporarily relocate due to the danger of PM2.5 particles. Power lines and connectors at the Morwell substation were washed for ash buildup to reduce the risk of short circuiting. Tim Flannery questioned whether GDF Suez was taking sufficient action to keep the community informed and said the fire highlighted the need for better preparation and inquiry into the state of mines around the country, and the risks they posed to nearby communities. On 11 March 2014, Premier Dennis Napthine announced a judicial inquiry into the circumstances and impacts of the fire. The Hazelwood Mine Fire Inquiry Report was published in 2016 and stated that the community has experienced adverse health effects and may be affected for an indeterminate period into the future. The inquiry found that 11 premature deaths were attributed to the mine fire. Many people and local businesses have experienced financial impacts for a range of reasons including a downturn in business, medical costs, veterinary costs, time taken off work, relocation from their homes, cleaning their homes and businesses, and possible decreases in property value. The Board estimated the total cost borne by the Victorian Government, the local community and the operator of the Hazelwood mine, GDF Suez, to exceed $100 million. In July 2015, Hazelwood owners GDF Suez announced that the company would refuse to pay the 18 million dollar bill for fighting the fire presented by the Country Fire Authority. According to a statement released by the company, the firefighting effort should be provided to it at no further charge as it had already paid routine taxes and levies in previous years, although the inquiry identified that the areas of the mine which burned were unrehabilitated, whereas rehabilitated areas did not catch fire. In May 2020 the Hazelwood Power Corporation was fined $1.56 million fine for occupational health and safety breaches associated with the fire.  Asbestos  The rate of pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma among power industry workers was found to be seven times the national average. (Victorian State Government study, 2001). Latrobe Valley power industry workers die 15 years younger than the national average. The power stations of the Latrobe Valley used asbestos widely in their construction and in the maintenance of the power plant. The substance was banned in Victoria in 2003. However, it's estimated that 146,000 employees and contractors, who worked in SEC plants from 1921 to the 1980s, were exposed to it. Between 1976 and 2008, $52.6 million has been paid to former SEC employees by the State Government insurance authority, and a further $369 million is expected to be paid out by the Victorian Managed Insurance Authority to former employees. In June 2010, the EPA confirmed it was investigating reports asbestos could be in one of Hazelwood's smoke stacks. A former worker claims to have lost his job after speaking out about asbestos at a health and safety meeting. Speaking to The Express newspaper he said, \\"It is not just in the stacks, it's everywhere, the place is riddled with it, Hazelwood has no duty of care to its workers or the public.\\" Another worker, trained in asbestos identification, said for years Hazelwood management had ignored workers' concerns. International Power Hazelwood spokesperson Neil Lawson has responded, \\"It is well documented that there is still an amount of contained asbestos material which, if required, is being progressively and safely removed by specialised licensed contractors during major plant outages and maintenance activities.\\" The same newspaper subsequently reported comments by the EPA that the Hazelwood business had no case to answer and that asbestos fibres were not present in its smokestacks. Criticisms and responses The Australian Conservation Foundation has put the 400 million 2005 Hazelwood expansion in context by comparing it to Victoria's five-star energy efficient homes standard, which is expected to save of greenhouse gases per annum. The ACF reasons that Hazelwood's operations would cancel out that benefit every four days. Former ACF Executive director Don Henry said he would follow formal objections with legal action to prevent the grant of 'new' coal to IPRH. Most of the West Field coal reserves were allocated to Hazelwood in 1996 in the privatisation process. The ACF did not mount any legal objection to Hazelwood's allocated coal reserves. Environment Victoria had been campaigning for the closure of Hazelwood power station since 2005 and has pushed for alternative baseload generation through: biomass energy, wave energy, geothermal energy, new combined cycle gas fired generation plants, new cogeneration facilities, or increased imports of baseload electricity from interstate. In January 2005, the Clean Energy Future Group together with Environment Victoria released the report \\"Toward Victoria's Clean Energy Future\\", a plan to cut Victoria's Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by 2010. It largely focused on cleaner alternatives to Hazelwood, and warned that continued support of coal-fired power development would lock the State into CO2 emissions that would dwarf any current proposed measures for reducing emissions. Following the 2014 Hazelwood mine fire, Environment Victoria worked with locals in the Latrobe Valley to ensure national attention to the pollution disaster by generating media coverage and urging an inquiry into the fire; releasing a report by Harvard University researchers about the hidden health costs of Hazelwood; appearing at both inquiries, cross-examining both government regulators and ENGIE executives and ensuring mine rehabilitation was on the agenda; and petitioning the mine owner to pay its firefighting bill to the Country Fire Authority. It afterwards entered into a campaign to improve coal mine rehabilitation efforts in Victoria and to ensure that mine rehabilitation bonds cover the actual costs of rehabilitation. in 2015, it started a petition signed by thousands of Victorians to call on the French government to phase out Hazelwood. In May 2016 the petition postcards were handed to French Environment Minister Segolene Royale on TV, which led to her response announcement that ENGIE would disengage from Hazelwood. Environment Victoria currently closely follows the Hazelwood closure process, engaging with LaTrobe Valley communities and campaigning for a just transition for the Valley. Greenpeace has pushed for a target of 20% clean energy for Victoria by 2020, expecting Hazelwood to have been retired, and to invigorate the Latrobe Valley as a clean energy hub. In June 2009, an anonymous letter purporting to come from the Earth Liberation Front was sent to the home of the CEO of the power station, Graeme York. The letter threatened to harm property, but did not threaten physical harm against any individuals or animals, despite being portrayed as such in commercial media due to the ELF activities overseas. ELF media spokesperson Jason Crawford defended the letter, but was unable to confirm that it had been sent by his organisation. The ELF letter was publicly condemned by Greenpeace, whose activists had engaged in nonviolent direct action at the plant six weeks earlier. In late 2009, in response to the \\"Switch Off Hazelwood‚ÄîSwitch on Renewables\\" protests, the State of Victoria introduced penalties of one years' imprisonment for trespass, and two years' imprisonment for damaging, interfering, tampering, or attaching something to electricity infrastructure. This was legislated in the Electricity Industry Amendment (Critical Infrastructure) Act 2009 (Vic). The legislation has been welcomed by the power industry but criticised by green groups for supposedly criminalising non- violent civil disobedience, and has been compared to the lockdown powers of the Major Events Act 2009, which has been reportedly used to intimidate and disperse peaceful protesters in NSW.. Protest and civil disobedience at Hazelwood On 11 August 2005 approximately 50 student environmentalists and Greenpeace volunteers unfurled a \\"Quit Coal\\" banner outside the plant while 12 activists occupied the brown coal pit, with two locking themselves to coal dredging equipment. This action drew worldwide attention to Hazelwood's CO2 emissions and their harmful impacts on the global climate. On 6 November 2008 a group of seven people protesting against Australia's inaction on climate change walked onto the site of the Hazelwood power station and temporarily stopped one conveyor belt which carries coal from the mine to the power station. No production was lost due to adequate reserve bunker stocks of coal. On 28 March 2009, a group of around 30 people took part in a rally at the power station ahead of the 2009 Earth Hour. Two protesters chained themselves to a conveyor belt, briefly disrupting the supply of coal between the Hazelwood mine and the power plant. Again, electricity production was not disrupted from the power station despite large community outcry against the plant's operations. Three people were charged by Victoria Police for unspecified reasons. On 21 May 2009, 14 Greenpeace members illegally entered the site and thought they had temporarily shut down coal production after chaining themselves to an excavator. That 'excavator' was out for routine maintenance and again, no production from either mine or station was lost. All seven were later charged by Victoria Police. =September 2009 rally= 500 people symbolically decommissioned the developed world's dirtiest power station at the \\"Switch off coal, switch on renewables\\" event in September 2009. A large mass civil disobedience rally, the largest of its kind at any Australian power station, was undertaken by a network of organisations under the banner Switch Off Hazelwood. On 13 September 2009, an estimated 500 people participated in near freezing conditions, with many camping nearby on the previous night on Hazelwood's own property beside the pondage. The rally was supported by organisations and groups including the Australian Conservation Foundation, Environment Victoria and the Australian Greens. Many of the participants were families and many were professional activists from Melbourne and interstate. In the week before the rally, a community meeting entitled \\"Clean energy or coal: What future for Latrobe jobs?\\" was held in the nearby town of Morwell. A large number of Hazelwood employees turned up to engage the protest organisers in a spirited debate about the reality of local jobs. Organisers liaised with Victoria Police prior to and during the demonstration and publicly declared intentions to undertake \\"peaceful civil disobedience\\" by entering the grounds of the power station to place symbolic decommission notices on the plant building. The organisers also distributed guidelines asking participants to use \\"peaceful protest tactics\\" and held a number of training sessions on civil disobedience and nonviolence prior to the event. The company responded by installing a temporary perimeter fence around the plant, with police helicopters and mounted police patrolling the site on Saturday evening. On the Sunday, police contingencies included a large number of officers on foot deployed within the perimeter fence. Many were issued with handheld video recorders and digital cameras and filmed people attending the rally. Police also deployed personnel in dingies in adjacent pondage lakes. A large number of activists also deployed video recording during the day. The rally began at 11am with speeches from Australian Greens Scott Ludlam, Dave Sweeney from the Australian Conservation Foundation, author David Spratt and Melbourne based paediatrician Merryn Redenbach, amongst others, with several speakers stressing that protesters had no argument with police or plant workers and emphasising the organising group's calls for new wind turbine, solar water and insulation manufacturing capacity to be developed in the Latrobe Valley. The group then marched to the front of the power station, where several participants, including some dressed in mock Carbon Police outfits, climbed temporary fencing in an attempt to issue a \\"Community Decommission Order\\" to the power station. Part of the crowd advanced on the temporary fencing and some participants and police clashed. 22 people were arrested during the rally, many for illegally trespassing on Hazelwood property after climbing the temporary fence. One person was also charged with assault after a police officer was allegedly \\"thrown backwards\\" while trying to stop a protester who was running towards the plant gates after scaling a temporary fence. Many protesters were officially charged and subsequently were recipients of diversion orders and various 'fines'. Many were able to donate their fines to charities of their choice which in some cases included their own activist groups. Supporters of the protest said that nonviolent direct action and civil disobedience was necessary because other avenues to achieve change, such as petitions, letters, rallies and community meetings, had been explored and exhausted. Environment groups had also lodged application to have the impact of greenhouse gas emissions considered in the Environmental Effects Statement which approved the access to Hazelwood's own coal fields in 2005. The rally was featured in the main group of lead items on every Victorian television and radio news broadcast that same evening, and in Newspapers the following morning. Hazelwood had subsequently installed permanent fencing marking its property boundary. =October 2010 rally= The replica Solar Thermal plant at the 2010 rally. 150 attendees - most from Melbourne - marched to the station on the International Day of Climate Action, 10 October 2010. Another rally took place at the station at 11am on 10 October 2010. Approximately 150 people attended, protesters were well behaved and there were no arrests., most travelling on the train from Melbourne. The rally coincided with the International Day of Climate Action. There were two training sessions held prior to the rally for participants in non-violent direct action, these occurred 18 September and 2 October at Trades Hall, Melbourne. In preparation for the rally, around 250 Police officers were stationed around the perimeter of the station. The Hazelwood business had erected several kilometres of permanent fencing in contrast to the previous year's rally, before which only temporary fencing was erected. The march caused local roads to be closed to the disruption of local community. The march to the station began at 11am and upon reaching the station's entrance, participants heard speeches from several speakers including Australian Greens Eastern Victorian upper house candidate Samantha Dunn and Beyond Zero Emissions' Mark Ogge, with Rod Quantock as the MC. Protesters were not allowed access beyond the road reserve outside the station itself. Following speeches, participants then built the largest ever replica Solar Thermal plant. = ASIO surveillance of protestors = In 2012 the media revealed that ASIO had been increasing its activity in monitoring anti-coal protestors. Minister Martin Ferguson named the Hazelwood power station as a focus of key concern. The surveillance measures were described as \\"intolerable\\" by then Australian Greens leader, Bob Brown. Carbon capture trials A two-year pilot trial of an algae photobioreactor was undertaken at Hazelwood in the early 2000s by Energetix, a division of the Victor Smorgon Group. The apparatus housed algae that feed on emissions from the smoke stacks, which were then harvested and turned into biofuels. The technology Hazelwood used was developed at MIT and was licensed from Greenfuels. The trial was successful and has now concluded. However, the technology was found not to be commercially viable and was not pursued further. In July 2009, International Power opened a carbon capture and storage demonstration plant at Hazelwood. The process takes emissions from the power station smoke stacks, extracts and uses a chemical process to turn it into calcium carbonate. The resulting solid can then be stored above ground or sold to industry. The trial facility captures 25 tonnes or 0.05% of daily emissions from the plant, with the possibility to scale up to 50 tonnes per day.

Highfill, K.A. Burnim and E.A. Langhans, 'Incledon, Charles Benjamin 1763‚Äì1826, singer, actor' in A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers, and other Stage Personnel in London, 1660‚Äì1800, Vol. 8: Hough to Keyse (SIU Press, 1982), pp. 86‚Äì99. Early career Charles Benjamin Incledon, the son of a doctor in St Keverne, Cornwall, was educated at Blundell's School and as a choirboy and soloist at Exeter Cathedral, under the tuition of organist and composer William Jackson. Before his voice broke, he was accustomed to sing in the Cathedral close to impromptu audiences, and once spent three days singing aboard a naval ship at Torquay.S. Baring-Gould, Cornish Characters and Strange Events (John Lane/Bodley Head, London and New York 1909), pp. 375‚Äì76. When of age he joined the Navy, and after two years' active service his fine tenor voice was 'discovered' by Admiral Hervey during a voyage to Saint Lucia, and, being generally admired in the Fleet, won the favour of Admiral Pigot. He took part in the Battle of the Saintes against the French Fleet in 1782. Upon discharge in 1783 he was sent with a recommendation to George Colman at the Haymarket, but was turned away. For a while he struggled in companies at Southampton and Salisbury, before gaining a place for a few seasons under John Palmer at the Theatre Royal, Bath:William Parke, Musical Memoirs (Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley, London 1830), vol. 1, p. 127. he soon came to the attention of the Venanzio Rauzzini, who gave him instruction, and, much admiring his Handelian singing (notably in 'Total Eclipse' from Samson), publicly called him his scholar. He first sang at Vauxhall Gardens in London, his songs of James Hook being found appropriate and pleasing, in summer 1786:W. Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830), vol. 1, p. 71. In 1787 Charles Dibdin mentions him as an established singer there.C. Dibdin, The Musical Tour of Mr. Dibdin; in which, previous to his embarcation for India, he finished his career as a public character (J. Gales, Sheffield 1788), p. 23, Letter VI (5 October 1787): 'I gave the song to Mr. Incledon, who sings it charmingly at Vauxhall.' On 12 January 1791 he sang before Josef Haydn at a meeting of the Anacreontic Club.L.M. Middleton, 'Incledon, Charles', Dictionary of National Biography, Vol XXVIII (Macmillan & Co, London & New York 1891), pp. 427‚Äì8. Covent Garden Thomas Harris heard Incledon at Bath, and engaged him, at first for three years, for Covent Garden. In accepting this offer the tenor narrowly missed a better one ‚Äì for higher fees and a longer term ‚Äì made soon afterwards by Thomas Linley. Incledon kept his agreement however, although his experiences with Covent Garden were not always of the happiest. He made a successful debut there in 1790 as Dermont in The Poor Soldier by William Shield, who became a lifelong friend and associate. In February 1791 he appeared in Shield's opera The Woodman, being universally encored in his ballad 'The streamlet', and with Charles Bannister in the same cast singing 'Much more a helpless woman'.W. Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830), vol. 1, p. 136. In 1793 he made a short Easter tour with Bowden, Mrs Martyr and the oboeist William Parke, to Portsmouth, where they were very well received. February 1794 introduced him in Shield's The travellers in Switzerland in a cast with Miss Poole, Mrs Martyr and Mr Fawcet; and in April in a new work, Netly Abbey (a compilation from various composers) Incledon sang Shield's old song 'The Arethusa', which he had already made his own.Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830), vol. 1, p. 187‚Äì88. Incledon's performances, and Shield's new operas, 'made him so popular that for several years he travelled in the summer, and at every considerable town in England gave an entertainment consisting of recitation and songs (on Dibdin's plan), with great applause and profit.'William Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830) Vol. 2, p. 249. At Covent Garden a notable production was the revival of The Beggar's Opera in October 1797, with Madame Mara (engaged for twelve nights at huge cost) as Polly and Mrs Martyr as Lucy. Incledon was thought unrivalled as MacHeath.Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830), vol 1, p. 253‚Äì54. In 1800 the two-act Paul and Virginia (music by Mazzinghi and Reeve) gave Incledon two pieces, one a spirited air with oboe obbligato, and the other, 'Our Country is our Ship' by Townshend won him a general encore.Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830) vol 1, p. 282. In 1800 also he earned the distinction of singing in the London premiere of Haydn's The Creation on 28 March in the composer's presence. The Oratorios at Covent Garden in 1801 commenced with Mozart's Requiem and Handel's L'allegro ed il pensieroso. Incledon's laugh, in his singing of 'Haste thee, Nymph' was so infectious that the audience joined in with him.Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830) vol 1, p. 291. In February the following year, Thomas Arne's opera Love in a Village was revived for Mrs. Billington, into which she introduced William Boyce's duet 'Together let us range the fields' for herself and Incledon, which was loudly encored. In the same month was presented a new comic opera written by Dibdin, The Cabinet (the music by various composers), in which Incledon appeared together with John Braham and Nancy Storace, and in delivering the hunting song 'his fine volume of voice filled the whole theatre'.Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830) vol 1, p. 304‚Äì06. Incledon's MacHeath was reprised at Margate in August 1803. Another new Dibdin opera, The British Fleet in 1342 (music entirely by Braham) appeared in December, and on that evening the highlight was a duet by Braham and Incledon, 'All's Well', which was encored.Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830), vol 1, p. 324. At Covent Garden, Incledon successfully took on as a tenor several important roles created by his friend the celebrated bass Charles Bannister, about a generation after the original productions. Thus he appeared as Tom Tug in Dibdin's The Waterman (first presented at the Haymarket in 1774)G.H. Davidson, The Songs of Charles Dibdin with a memoir by George Hogarth, 2 vols (G.H. Davidson, London 1848), I, pp. xx, xxxiii, 44‚Äì45. and in 1809 took the role of Mr. Steady in Dibdin's The Quaker (first presented at Drury Lane in 1777).The British Drama: A Collection of the Most Esteemed Tragedies, Comedies, Operas, and Farces, in the English Language. In Two Volumes, (Jones & Co., London 1824), Vol. 1, p. 233.A propos The Quaker, it is amusingly related that Incledon, finding himself in Margate to play Mr Steady without a suitable costume, induced a 'comfortable plump-looking Quaker' whom he met in the street to lend him his clothes for the night: and the Quaker attended the performance from a hidden vantage, to see how his people were represented. See Mrs Mathews, Memoir of Charles Mathews, Comedian (Richard Bentley, London 1838), Vol. 2, pp. 201‚Äì03 In 1810, similarly, he appeared as the Serjeant in Isaac Bickerstaffe's musical entertainment of The Recruiting Serjeant (formerly produced at the Royalty Theatre in 1789, first 1770),The British Drama, 1824, p. 210. and in 1814 as Mr. Belville (another Bannister role) in Mrs Brook's opera Rosina (presented first at Covent Garden in 1783).The British Drama, 1824, p. 241. Since the airs or ballads in these musical dramas stood alone with spoken dialogue, the transposition from bass to tenor did not create excessive difficulty. After singing in that theatre for many years, and after several disagreements with Harris, he finally withdrew, and 'soon after took a parting benefit at the Italian Opera House, at play-house prices, assisted by many of his brethren of both theatres, to a house filled to an excess that proved how highly his talents were appreciated.'W. Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830) Vol. 2, p. 250.S. Baring-Gould, Cornish Characters (1908), p. 378. The singer among his contemporaries Incledon sang both in opera and in oratorio, but his chief popularity lay in his delivery of ballads ('not the modern sentimental composition, but of the robust old school'Baring-Gould, Cornish Characters (1908), p. 379.), such as The Lass of Richmond Hill, Sally in our Alley, Black-eyed Susan, The Arethusa, and anything of a bold and manly type. He enjoyed an undiminished popularity of twenty-five or thirty years's duration. He was a very forthright man, given to speaking his mind openly to all and sundry (sometimes with humorous results), which also showed itself in the freedom and natural expression of his singing, and he had ample vocal resources to sustain the flights of interpretative impulse which enlivened his performances.Spectator, 3 October 1829, p. 8. A somewhat vain man,His vanity caused his friends to play practical jokes on him, see Mrs. Mathews, Memoirs of Charles Mathews, Comedian 2 Vols (Richard Bentley, London 1838), Vol 2, pp. 161‚Äì167. who affected gold jewellery and snuff-box, he regarded himself (not entirely without cause) as the 'English Ballad Singer.' Edward Fitzball, who as a lad saw him play Macheath, remembered him being very fat, with an immense white cravat in which his chin seemed buried, his costume a blue dress coat with gilt buttons, a white waistcoat, leather 'smalls' and top boots.E. Fitzball, Thirty-Five Years of a Dramatic Author's Life, 2 Vols (T.C. Newby, London 1859), I, pp. 296‚Äì301. His friendship and professional involvement with William Shield, from his first days at Covent Garden, set the character of his career. He and Shield, Charles Bannister, Charles Dignum, 'Jack' Johnstone, Charles Ashley and William Parke in 1793 formed themselves into 'The Glee Club', a set which met on Sunday evenings during the season at the Garrick's Head Coffee House in Bow Street, once a fortnight, for singing among themselves and dining together.W. Parke, Musical memoirs (1830), pp. 175‚Äì79. Many of Shield's songs were either written for him or were sung by him, with the composer's high approval. Shield said of him that, not only did Incledon's interpretation of the songs he had written for him never disappoint his expectation, but that he often brought a grace, beauty and charm to them which the composer had not imagined to be present in his own work, and that a large share of the popularity of those songs might be credited to Incledon's unrivalled excellence in singing them. Many songs were written for him also by George Baker (1773‚Äì1847), the composer and organist of Stafford and Derby, who had been a fellow-pupil of Incledon's under Jackson at Exeter.W.H. Husk, 'Baker, George, Mus. Bac.' in J.A. Fuller Maitland (Ed.), Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Vol. I (Macmillan & Co., London 1922), pp. 167‚Äì68. Of these friends, Charles Dignum was the singer whose range and repertoire most nearly resembled his own. Like him, Dignum took Dibdin roles such as The Waterman. It was said of Incledon that he gave to everything his own reading, and though he had rivals, his own distinctive style and character never had any true successors. He was master of a certain declamatory recitation style exemplified by The Storm by G.A. Stevens, a stentorian ballad of near- shipwreck requiring much range of volume and vocal colour, his performance of which assisted his success at Portsmouth in 1793, caused Mrs Siddons to sob like a child, and astonished John Kemble at that great actor's retirement dinner.S. Baring-Gould, Cornish Characters (1908), pp. 377‚Äì80, citing William Robson, The Old Playgoer (1846). His background in the naval sea-song genre, and experience of seafaring, no doubt coloured his delivery and gave it authenticity, just as he never lost his Cornish accent. Incledon's greatest rival, or peer (for it was 'a rivalry in name rather than reality'), was John Braham. Braham, in addition to his own experience as a cantor, owed a great deal to the refined Italian vocal methods taught by his master, the male soprano Venanzio Rauzzini. Incledon, who had also received instruction from Rauzzini, was decidedly English in his musical outlook and had little time for foreign music, or for people who enthused about songs the words of which they did not understand. The continuing contest between Italian and English styles of composition and singing found an epitome in the materials and style of Incledon and Braham, which, in an age of nationalistic feeling, prompted unworthy anti-semitic commentaries in some quarters against Braham.Thomas Rowlandson, 'Family Quarrels, or, The Jew and The Gentile', in Ruth HaCohen, The Music Libel Against the Jews: Vocal Fictions of Noise and Harmony (Yale University Press, 2012), Fig. 2.4 and pp. 124‚Äì25. Incledon himself, however, was good-hearted but of irritable humour, and was easily teased into a fury about the \\"Italianized humbug\\" of Braham's style of singing.Mrs Mathews, Memoir of Charles Mathews, Comedian (Richard Bentley, London 1838) Vol. 2, pp. 207‚Äì09. The faultless sweetness and perfection of Samuel Harrison (who sang mostly in oratorio and ballad concertsP. Drummond, The Provincial Music Festival in England, 1784‚Äì1914 (Ashgate Publishing, 2013), p. 175; M. Argent (Ed), The Recollections of R.J.S. Stevens: An organist in Georgian London (Abridged edition) (SIU Press, 1992), pp. 293‚Äì94; see Wikisource) lacked the warmth, spontaneity and declamatory power of Incledon, who sang principally on the stage. Michael Kelly, despite his 'Hibernian elasticity', and his association with very distinguished European musicians, owed his later popular favour as much to his useful endeavours in theatrical management, but as a singer in the English mould was less substantial. Descriptions of the voice Incledon 'had a voice of uncommon power and sweetness, both in the natural and falsetto. The former was from A to G, a compass of about fourteen notes; the latter he could use from D to E or even F, or about ten notes. His natural voice was full and open, and of such ductility, that when he sang pianissimo it retained its original quality. His falsetto was rich, sweet, and brilliant, and totally unlike the other. He could use it with facility, and execute in it ornaments of a certain class with volubility and sweetness. His shake was good, and his intonation much more correct than is common to singers so imperfectly educated... When Rauzzini first heard him at Bath, rolling his voice upwards like a surge of the sea, till, touching the top note it expired in sweetness, he exclaimed in rapture...'S. Baring-Gould, Cornish Characters (1908), pp. 378‚Äì79. In 1829 it was recalled: 'The splendour and sweetness of his voice yet rings in our ears. It combined every excellence of which the vocal organ is capable. Powerful, brilliant, sweet, liquid, rich ‚Äì it flowed out and onward like a torrent; while its correct intonation, and singularly melodious quality, made its most subdued tones effective. Incledon was nature's songster.''The late Charles Incledon', The Spectator, 3 October 1829, p. 8 (volume page 632). Later career In 1811, having come to a severance with Covent Garden, Incledon planned to go to America. The comedian Charles Mathews had defended him against the falsehoods put up against Incledon by the theatre managers, and now agreed to embark with him on a provincial tour to Rochester, Canterbury, Margate, Sandwich, Brighton, Chichester, Portsmouth, Cheltenham, Bath, Derby, Hull, York, Wakefield, Doncaster and Sheffield and indeed to Ireland, with an entertainment called 'Mail-coach Adventures'. The Mathews Memoir includes several entertaining anecdotes of the singer,Mrs Mathews, Memoir of Charles Mathews (Richard Bentley, London 1838), Vol. 2, pp. 153‚Äì210. showing that in many respects he remained childlike all his life, simultaneously generous and parsimonious, and given to hard swearing on all occasions, a person whose escapades and eccentricities were very amusing in retrospect once the embarrassment which they at first caused had passed. By January 1812 Mathews and Incledon had agreed to discontinue their association finally and absolutely, but Incledon regretted it and sought a reconciliation. 'Mr Incledon, although universally allowed to possess great goodness of heart, was nevertheless a very unfit ally to a man of professional habits, for of such habits Mr Incledon had no idea.'Mathews, Memoir of Charles Mathews, Vol. 2, pp. 195‚Äì96. In a letter to an intermediary, Mathews concluded 'as to meeting Incledon again, \\"never shall sun that morrow see\\".' In 1817, by which time his powers were somewhat diminished, he toured in North America; he is said to have made ¬£5000 by the expedition.Morning Post, 7 September 1818. He appeared at the Park Theatre, New York, in October 1817 as Hawthorn in Love in a Village (which was not very well received) and left that city a year later. In 1819 he appeared as Robin Hood in the burletta Robin Hood and Little John at the Surrey Theatre with Rosemond Mountain as Maid Marian. On retiring from the operatic stage, at the English Opera House in April 1822, he travelled through the provinces with an entertainment called The Wandering Melodist. He retired to live at Prospect Place, in Brighton, where he founded and occupied himself with the Brighton Glee Club. He suffered a serious illness in 1823: his offer to assist at the opening of the Chain Pier by singing 'Rule Britannia' and the National Anthem was declined.Morning Post, 4 December 1823, p. 3. He recovered sufficiently to sing again, but at a recital on 15 October 1824, at Southampton, he announced that this should be his last appearance on any stage.Salisbury and Winchester Journal, 18 October 1824, p. 4. He was in Worcester when a second attack of paralysis proved fatal.W. Parke, Musical Memoirs (1830) Vol. 2, p. 250‚Äì51.

In 1837 Perring and British archaeologist Richard William Howard Vyse began excavating at Giza; they were later joined by Giovanni Battista Caviglia. They used gunpowder to force their way into several monuments and then to reach hidden chambers within them, such as the burial chamber of the pyramid of Menkaure, documenting them as they went. When Caviglia left the team to work independently, Perring became Vyse's assistant and when Vyse himself left for England in 1837 Perring continued the excavation with Vyse's financial support. As part of his work Perring created several maps, plans and cross-sections of the pyramids at Abu Roasch, Gizeh, Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur. He was the first to explore the interior of the Pyramid of Userkaf at Saqqara in 1839, through a robber's tunnel first discovered in 1831. Perring thought the pyramid belonged to Djedkare. The pyramid was first correctly identified by Egyptologist Cecil Firth in 1928 (though Firth died in 1931 and excavations there only recommenced in 1948, under Jean-Philippe Lauer). Perring opened the northern entrance into the Bent Pyramid and added some graffiti inside the nearby Red Pyramid at Dahshur, which can still be viewed today. Perring's work resulted in his three-volume \\"The Pyramids of Gizeh\\", published in 1839 to 1842. Vyse also published Perring's sketches in the third volume of his own three-part work \\"Appendix to Operations carried on at the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837\\".

The school roll is some 1,800 students.British School Al Khubairat, Dubaifaqs  Overview  The school follows the National Curriculum of England and Wales, and is an international member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), the Independent Association of Preparatory Schools (IAPS) and the Council of British International Schools (COBIS). It has also received a rating of 'excellent' by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI).BSAK news Paul Coackley was Principal of the school from September 2005 until June 2013. Dr. Christopher Ray started as the Headmaster in September 2013 but was replaced by Elaine Rawlings in May 2014. In September 2015, Mark Leppard MBE began his role of Headteacher. History The school was established in January 1968 on land donated by the then Ruler of Abu Dhabi, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, in an area of the city known as Khubairat. This area was the part of the Corniche where the pearl fishing fleet were first sighted on their return from sea. One suggested translation of the word 'Khubairat' is 'good news'. In May 1971, the school was registered as a legal entity by Amiri Decree No. 5 of 1971, with its management vested in the Board of Governors. The board is made up of elected governors and those appointed by the British Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. The school has been sponsored since 1980 by His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, The President of the UAE. In 1980 the school moved into purpose built facilities at its current location on Airport Road in Al Mushrif. The facilities provided primary education for children between 3 and 11 years old. The original campus comprised an administration block, four teaching blocks and two sports halls. It also included a 25m swimming pool, around which were constructed staff quarters that accommodated the school's teachers. Towards the end of the 1990s it became apparent that there was a need in Abu Dhabi for the provision of secondary education. Increasingly, Abu Dhabi was no longer a posting of two to three years for most British expatriates, with more families staying here for five to ten years. As The British School was the centre for educational provision within the British expatriate society in Abu Dhabi, the Board of Governors approved the construction of a secondary school alongside the original primary buildings on the existing site. This was Phase 1 of The British School development programme. Whilst Phase 1 was under construction, the board proceeded with the construction of Phase 2, a three-storey building for the primary school. Construction commenced in April 2001 and the Jubilee Building (Years 3‚Äì6) was formally opened by HE Sheikh Nayhan Bin Mubarak Al Nahyan in April 2002. As the construction of Phase 2 was drawing to a close, the new secondary school was proving to be a success with full classes progressing into Years 7, 8 and 9. It became apparent that many families in Abu Dhabi wished to see their children continue their education at The British School into the sixth form so they could sit their A Levels in Abu Dhabi. The first A Level students completed their studies in June 2005. A third phase of development was started in October 2002. The building includes a theatre, auditorium, library, sixth form accommodation, an additional gymnasium, drama studio, music centre and a range of academic and administrative facilities. The building was opened in September 2005. The school now holds approximately 1,800 students. In 2012, the school opened Phase IV of its development. The Ruby Building is a new primary block for the youngest children, from Nursery to Year 2, as well as being home to several facilities such as: Junior School library, the instrumental department, two indoor pools, Junior School sports halls, a drama/dance studio, the Science garden, the food technology room and the Junior School Science laboratory, in addition to classroom facilities. Fees 2013‚Äì2014 * Nursery: 34,054 dirhams per annum. * Junior School: 44,160 dirhams per annum. * Secondary School: 59,296 dirhams per annum. Campus The school's campus consists of four gyms, two pitches, a playground, a swimming pool, a basketball court, a theatre, two libraries and seven teaching blocks/buildings. The school occupies a space of approx 39,579 m¬≤ with car parking provided for parents, students and visitors.

It can be used to refer to a philosophy, methodology or community. The term was coined in the early 1990s to describe the work of feminists interested in theorizing, critiquing, exploring and re-making the Internet, cyberspace and new-media technologies in general. The foundational catalyst for the formation of cyberfeminist thought is attributed to Donna Haraway's ‚ÄúA Cyborg Manifesto‚Äú, third wave feminism, post-structuralist feminism, riot grrrl culture and the feminist critique of the blatant erasure of women within discussions of technology. Definition Cyberfeminism is a sort of alliance that wants to defy any sort of boundaries of identity and definition and rather be truly postmodern in its potential for radical openness. This is seen with the 1997 Old Boys Network's 100 anti-theses which lists the 100 ways \\"cyberfeminism is not.\\" Cornelia Sollfrank from the Old Boys Network states that: \\"Cyberfeminism is a myth. A myth is a story of unidentifiable origin, or of different origins. A myth is based on one central story which is retold over and over in different variations. A myth denies one history as well as one truth, and implies a search for truth in the spaces, in the differences between the different stories. Speaking about Cyberfeminism as a myth, is not intended to mystify it, it simply indicates that Cyberfeminism only exists in plural.\\" * Also available as: :: See also: ::: and: Mia Consalvo defines cyberfeminism as: # a label for women‚Äîespecially young women who might not even want to align with feminism's history‚Äînot just to consume new technologies but to actively participate in their making; # a critical engagement with new technologies and their entanglement with power structures and systemic oppression. The dominant cyberfeminist perspective takes a utopian view of cyberspace and the Internet as a means of freedom from social constructs such as gender, sex difference and race. For instance, a description of the concept described it as a struggle to be aware of the impact of new technologies on the lives of women as well as the so-called insidious gendering of technoculture in everyday life. It also sees technology as a means to link the body with machines. This is demonstrated in the way cyberfeminism‚Äîas maintained by theorists such as Barbara Kennedy‚Äîis said to define a specific cyborgian consciousness concept, which denotes a way of thinking that breaks down binary and oppositional discourses. There is also the case of the renegotiation of the artificial intelligence (AI), which is considered top- down masculinist, into bottom-up feminized version labeled as ALife programming. VNS Matrix member, Julianne Pierce defines cyberfeminism: \\"In 1991, in a cozy Australian city called Adelaide, four bored girls decided to have some fun with art and French Feminist theory...with homage to Donna Haraway they began to play around with the idea of cyberfeminism.\\" Authors Hawthorne and Klein explain the different analyses of cyberfeminism in their book: \\"Just as there are liberal, socialist, radical and postmodern feminists, so too one finds these positions reflected in the interpretations of cyberfeminism.\\" Preview. * See also: Cyberfeminism is not just the subject matter, but is the approach taken to examine subject matter. For example: Cyberfeminism can be a critique at equality in cyberspace, challenge the gender stereotype in the cyberspace, examine the gender relationship in cyberspace, examine the collaboration between human and technology, examine the relationship between women and technology and more. *Also as: Details.  Theoretical background  Cyberfeminism arose partly as a reaction to \\"the pessimism of the 1980s feminist approaches that stressed the inherently masculine nature of techno-science\\", a counter movement against the 'toys for boys' perception of new Internet technologies. As cyberfeminist artist Faith Wilding argued: \\"If feminism is to be adequate to its cyberpotential then it must mutate to keep up with the shifting complexities of social realities and life conditions as they are changed by the profound impact communications technologies and techno science have on all our lives. It is up to cyberfeminists to use feminist theoretical insights and strategic tools and join them with cybertechniques to battle the very real sexism, racism, and militarism encoded in the software and hardware of the Net, thus politicizing this environment.\\" Donna Haraway is the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism with her 1985 essay \\"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\\" which was reprinted in Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature (1991). Haraway's essay states that cyborgs are able to transcend the public and private spheres, but they do not have the ability to identify with their origins or with nature in order to develop a sense of understanding through differences between self and others. Shulamith Firestone and her book The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution has been named as a precursor to Haraway's work in cyberfeminism. Firestone's work focuses reproductive technology and advancing it to eliminate the connection of the feminine identity being connected to child birth. Firestone believed that gender inequality and oppression against women could be solved if the roles around reproduction did not exist. Both Firestone and Haraway had ideals based on making individuals androgynous, and both women wanted society to move beyond biology through improving technology. Cyberfeminism is considered a predecessor to networked feminism. Cyberfeminism also has a relationship to the field of feminist science and technology studies. British cultural theorist Sadie Plant chose cyberfeminism to describe her recipe for defining the feminizing influence of technology on western society and its inhabitants.  Timeline  = 1970s = Shulamith Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution created the foundation for many cyberfeminist activities. In her book The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution, Firestone explores the possibility of using technology to eliminate sexism by freeing women from their obligation to carry children in order to create a nuclear family. In many ways, this can be seen as a precursor to cyberfeminism because it questions the role in which technology should play a role in dismantling the patriarchy. = 1980s = Donna Haraway was the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism with her 1985 essay \\"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\\", which was later reprinted in Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature (1991). Haraway's essay states that cyborgs are able to transcend the public and private spheres, but they do not have the ability to identify with their origins or with nature in order to develop a sense of understanding through differences between self and others. Haraway had ideals based on making individuals androgynous, and wanted society to move beyond biology through improving technology. = 1990s = The term cyberfeminism was first used around 1991 by both the English cultural theoretician Sadie Plant and the Australian artist group VNS Matrix, independently from each other. In Canada, in 1991 Nancy Paterson wrote an article entitled \\"Cyberfeminism\\" for EchoNYC. In Adelaide, Australia, a four- person collective called VNS Matrix wrote the Cyberfeminist Manifesto in 1991; they used the term cyberfeminist to label their radical feminist acts \\"to insert women, bodily fluids and political consciousness into electronic spaces.\\" That same year, British cultural theorist Sadie Plant used the term to describe definition of the feminizing influence of technology on western society. In 1996, a special volume of Women & Performance was devoted to sexuality and cyberspace. It was a compendium of essays on cybersex, online stalking, fetal imaging, and going digital in New York. According to Carolyn Guertin, the first Cyberfeminist International, organized by the Old Boys Network in Germany, in 1997, refused to define the school of thought, but drafted the \\"100 Anti-Theses of Cyberfeminism\\" instead. Guertin says that cyberfeminism is a celebration of multiplicity. = 2000s = In the late 1990s and early 2000s, cyberfeminist theorists and artists incorporated insights from postcolonial and subaltern studies about the intersection of gender and race, inspired by thinkers such as Donna Haraway and Gayatri Spivak. Artists such as Coco Fusco, Shu Lea Cheang, and Prema Murthy, explored the ways that gender and race by combining performance art, video art, and with the then-emerging technologies of interactive websites, digital graphics, and streaming media.See \\"Shu Lea Cheang on Brandon - Rhizome.org interview\\"; \\"Bindigirl - Rhizome.org Interview with Prema Murthy\\"; Dennis, Kelly, ‚ÄúGendered Ghosts in the Globalized Machine: Coco Fusco and Prema Murthy,‚Äù n.paradoxa vol. 23 (2009), pp. 79-86. In 2003 the feminist anthology Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium was published; it includes the essay \\"Cyberfeminism: Networking the Net\\" by Amy Richards and Marianne Schnall. = 2010s = Usage of the term cyberfeminism has faded away after the millennium, partly as a result of the dot.com bubble burst that bruised the utopian bent of much of digital culture. Radhika Gajjala and Yeon Ju Oh's Cyberfeminism 2.0 argues that cyberfeminism in the 21st century has taken many new forms and focuses on the different aspects of women's participation online. They find cyberfeminists in women's blogging networks and their conferences, in women's gaming, in fandom, in social media, in online mothers' groups performing pro-breastfeeding activism, and in online spaces developed and populated by marginal networks of women in non-Western countries. Feminist action and activism online is prevalent, especially by women of colour, but has taken on different intersectional terms. While there are writing on black cyberfeminism which argue that not only is race not absent in our use of the internet, but race is a key component in how we interact with the internet,. However, women of colour generally do not associate with cyberfeminism, and rather re-frame afrofuturism in feminist terms. Xenofeminism is an offshoot of cyberfeminism that came into existence through a collective that calls themselves Laboria Cuboniks. In its manifesto, Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation, the collective argues against nature as natural and immutable for a future where all identities are non-binary and in which feminism destabilizes and uses the master's tools for their own rebuilding of life: \\"Xenofeminism is gender-abolitionist. 'Gender abolitionism' is shorthand for the ambition to construct a society where traits currently assembled under the rubric of gender, no longer furnish a grid for the asymmetric operation of power. 'Race abolitionism' expands into a similar formula ‚Äì that the struggle must continue until currently racialized characteristics are no more a basis of discrimination than the color of one's eyes. Ultimately, every emancipatory abolitionism must incline towards the horizon of class abolitionism, since it is in capitalism where we encounter oppression in its transparent, denaturalized form: you're not exploited or oppressed because you are a wage labourer or poor; you are a labourer or poor because you are exploited.\\" The decline in volume of cyberfeminist literature in recent years would suggest that cyberfeminism has somewhat lost momentum as a movement, however, in terms of artists and artworks, not only cyberfeminism is still taking place, but its artistic and theoretical contribution has been of crucial importance to the development of posthuman aesthetics.  Critiques  Many critiques of cyberfeminism have focused on its lack of intersectional focus, its utopian vision of cyberspace, especially cyberstalking and cyber- abuse, its whiteness and elite community building. One of the major critiques of cyberfeminism, especially as it was in its heyday in the 1990s, was that it required economic privilege to get online: \\"By all means let [poor women] have access to the Internet, just as all of us have it‚Äîlike chocolate cake or AIDS,\\" writes activist Annapurna Mamidipudi. \\"Just let it not be pushed down their throats as 'empowering.' Otherwise this too will go the way of all imposed technology and achieve the exact opposite of what it purports to do.\\" Cyberfeminist artist and thinker Faith Wilding also critiques its utopian vision for not doing the tough work of technical, theoretical and political education.  Art and artists  The practice of cyberfeminist art is inextricably intertwined with cyberfeminist theory. The 100 anti-theses make clear that cyberfeminism is not just about theory, while theory is extremely important, cyberfeminism requires participation. As one member of the cyberfeminist collective the Old Boys Network writes, cyberfeminism is \\"linked to aesthetic and ironic strategies as intrinsic tools within the growing importance of design and aesthetics in the new world order of flowing pancapitalism\\". * Also available as: :: See also: ::: and: Cyberfeminism also has strong connections with the DIY feminism movement, as noted in the seminal text DIY Feminism, a grass roots movement that encourages active participation, especially as a solo practitioner or a small collective. Around the late 1990s several cyberfeminist artists and theorists gained a measure of recognition for their works, including the above-mentioned VNS Matrix and their Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st century, and Faith Wilding and Critical Art Ensemble. Some of the better-known examples of cyberfeminist work include Auriea Harvey's work, Sandy Stone, Linda Dement's Cyberflesh Girlmonster a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women's body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes; Melinda Rackham's Carrier, a work of web-based multimedia art that explores the relationship between humans and infectious agents; Prema Murthy's 1998 work Bindigirl,Bindigirl (Archived at Rhizome Artbase). a satirical Asian porn website that examines the intersection of racialized gender, sexuality, and religion online; Murthy's 2000 project Mythic Hybrid,A video document of the project is hosted by Turbulence.org. based on reports of mass hysteria among microchip factory workers in India; Shu Lea Cheang's 1998 work Brandon, which was the first Internet based artwork to be commissioned and collected by the Guggenheim. A later work of Cheang's, I.K.U. (2001), is a sci-fi pornographic film that imagines a cybersexual post-Blade Runner universe, where sexual encounters with feminine, shapeshifting \\"replicants\\" are distilled and collected for resale, and ultimately reuse. I.K.U was the first pornographic film to screen at Sundance. Dr. Caitlin Fisher's online hypertext novella ‚Äú‚ÄòThese Waves of Girls‚Äú is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring polymorphous perversity enacted in her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips. Recent artworks of note include Evelin Stermitz's World of Female Avatars in which the artist has collected quotes and images from women over the world and displayed them in an interactive browser based format, and Regina Pinto's Many Faces of Eve. O[rphan] D[frift>] (1994-2003) were a 4.5 person collective experimenting with writing, art, music and the internet's potential \\"treating information as matter and the image as a unit of contagion.\\" Listserves An important part of the generation of cyberfeminist theory and critique was the emergence of a few critical listserves that served as the basis for the organization of three international cyberfeminist events and several major publications. * Nettime ‚Äì More broadly situated in new media theory the nettime listserve became a site for the discussion, performance, and arbitration of cyberfeminist theory in 1997. * FACES ‚Äì The FACES-l.net mailing list started in the spring of 1997 partly out of a series of concurrent dinner conversations known as the Face Settings Project. The initial goal of the project was to bring together women working in the intersections of art, media to share their work and to counter the lack of women's work presented at international festivals. Faces-l was created as a means for the artists, curators, djs, designers, activists, programmers, and technologists meeting at festivals to share their work and discuss gender and media with an international community of women.

Poole Bay is a relatively shallow embayment and consists of steep sandstone cliffs and several 'chines' that allow easy access to the sandy beaches below. The coast along the bay is continuously built up, and is part of the South East Dorset conurbation, including parts of the towns of Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch. The bay is often erroneously referred to as Bournemouth Bay,e.g. Bournemouth Bay Fun Run because much of it is occupied by Bournemouth. In terms of sand on England's south coast the bay presents the longest stretch; much exceeded by the total to the west across numerous bays and coves but greater than the three such stretches to the east, Avon Beach, West Wittering and Camber Sands. History Measures to prevent coastal erosion have been deployed throughout the 20th century. Concrete seawalls and groynes allowed the construction of homes and roads on the clifftops, but prevented natural supply of sand and gravel to the shore. From 1970 to 2000 over 1.5 million m¬≥ of sand was used to replenish the beaches at Bournemouth and Poole. Many of the beaches along Poole Bay were replenished during the winters of 2005 and 2006 with 1.1 million m¬≥ of sand dredged from Poole Harbour and 700,000 m¬≥ of sand dredged from a Licensed Area off the Isle of Wight. In 2015 a 17-year ¬£43.7million project was approved to protect the beaches from further erosion over the next century. The plans involve replacing the groynes and adding new ones and replenishing the beaches with 210,000 cubic metres of sand and gravel every three years. Geology The area of Poole Bay was predominantly created during the Pleistocene period, when the Solent river ran across the whole of South East Dorset and West Hampshire, out past the Isle of Wight The solid geology of the cliffs, and the seabed beneath Poole Bay, is composed of rocks of the Tertiary Bracklesham Group, consisting of a sequence of fine, medium and coarse sands. At Hengistbury Head there are younger rocks of the Bartonian group, forming an outlier. The Barton Clay here is made up of a series of sands and interbedded clays, with four distinct bands of ironstone nodules. These formations dip eastwards and are cut out by a north-west to south-east trending fault. This defines the eastwards boundary of Christchurch Ledge, which is a seawards continuation of the resistant ironstone strata exposed in Hengistbury Head.

It was founded by Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra (1816-1888) with the collaboration of his mentor, Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky (1804-1878) and Carl Wedl (1815-1891), a pathologist with interest in skin diseases. Their pupils, Isidor Neumann (1832-1906), Salomon Stricker (1834-1898), Heinrich Auspitz (1834-1885), Moritz Kaposi (1837-1902), all of the same generation; and Paul Gerson Unna (1850-1929) and Salomon Ehrmann (1854-1926), continued the tradition. Unna later became the father of German dermatopathology. Von Hebra first organized the dermatological service in the Vienna General Hospital. He was inspired by the movement towards a scientific dermatology already established in England by Robert Willan (1757-1812) and Thomas Bateman (1778-1821); and in France by Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert (1768-1837), Laurent-Th√©odore Biett (1781-1840), Pierre Louis Alph√©e Cazenave (1795-1877) and Pierre Fran√ßois Olive Rayer (1793-1867). The Vienna School adopted the approach of pathology (as influenced by the great Carl von Rokitansky, a professor of von Hebra) and the doctrine of local causative agents. For example, 2,000 of the first 2,500 dermatological patients treated by von Hebra had scabies. The members of the Vienna School discovered and described many new diseases and signs, such as: * Auspitz's sign * Eczema herpeticum * Erythema exudativum multiforme * Hebra's disease * Hebra's prurigo * Impetigo herpetiformis * Kaposi-Irgang syndrome * Kaposi's sarcoma * Lichen acuminatus * Lichen planus bullosus * Lichen ruber moniliformis * Lupus erythematosus * Pityriasis rubra * Tinea cruris * Unna- Politzer naevus * Unna's disease * Unna-Thost syndrome * Xeroderma pigmentosa Bibliography * Finnerud CW.

It was developed by jazz vibraphonist Gary Burton around the 1960s. The grip was designed to make up for Burton's perceived shortcomings of the traditional grip, which he thought could be difficult to control while changing intervals. Burton grip was also designed so that a player could play two-mallet lines and melodies without having to put down two mallets. Gary Burton had observed that jazz vibraphonists would tend to play harmony using four mallets, but switch to a two mallet grip to solo, so he made the Burton grip so that one could solo without having to switch grips, allowing for chords to be used during these solos. It is formed as a variant of the cross grip, with the mallets held as follows: Seen with the palm facing upwards, the inside mallet is placed and crossed over the outside mallet. The end of the inside mallet is held with the little finger, and outside mallet is held between the index and middle fingers. The thumb is generally placed inside the inside mallet, but it sometimes is placed between the mallets to widen the interval. The inner mallet (generally used for melodies) can be separately articulated by gripping with the index finger and the thumb and pivoting over the outer mallet. When necessary, the outer mallet can be separately articulated by widening the interval so the mallets come as close to a right angle as possible and giving a swift downward flick with the wrist and middle and index fingers. Although results may vary from player to player, the advantage to the Burton grip is stability, where holding a specific interval steady is typically more comfortable than in other grips. Playing two-mallet lines is another strength of the grip, as one can play the lines using any combination of mallets (although melodies are typically played with the 2 and 4 mallets) with relative comfort and control.

Along with Burley in Wharfedale, most of Menston is within Wharfedale Ward in the metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford. The remainder of Menston is in the Leeds City Council area. As of the 2011 Census it has a population of 4,498 (down from 4,660 in 2001). Landmarks Menston's Anglican parish church is dedicated to St John the Divine, and is part of the Diocese of Leeds. Other notable buildings include the former High Royds Hospital and St. Mary's Menston Catholic Academy, both of which are in the Leeds part of Menston. The site of High Royds Hospital, originally the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, which is just inside the City of Leeds metropolitan borough, has been converted to housing called \\"Highroyds Village\\". This is a reflection of Menston's growing size. In the past 20 years there has been increased demand for much needed housing in the area. The population of Menston has been steadily increasing. As a result, Menston primary school, which was threatened with closure in the 1980s, has increased student numbers. Transport It lies on the A65, approximately ten miles north-west of the centre of Leeds and 9 miles north of Bradford centre, between Guiseley and Burley-in-Wharfedale. Menston also has a railway station between Guiseley and Burley on the Wharfedale Line, with direct trains to Leeds, Bradford Forster Square and Ilkley. There are bus services to Leeds, Otley and Wetherby (an infrequent bus service run by Utopia). Menston once had rail links to Otley, via the (now closed) Arthington to Menston Line. Cultural references Highroyds is mentioned in the Kaiser Chiefs song of the same name, from the album, Yours Truly Angry Mob. The Kaiser Chiefs met and formed in the same class at St Mary's Catholic High School, now St. Mary's Menston.

It contains constraint solver libraries, a high-level modeling and control language (a superset of Prolog), interfaces to third-party solvers, an integrated development environment and interfaces for embedding into host environments. ECLiPSe was developed until 1995 at the European Computer‚ÄêIndustry Research Centre (ECRC) in Munich and then until 2005 at the Centre for Planning and Resource Control at Imperial College London (IC-Parc). It was purchased by Cisco Systems. In September 2006, it was released as open source software under an equivalent of the Mozilla Public License, and is now hosted on SourceForge. Language The ECLiPSe language is largely backward- compatible with Prolog and supports different dialects, including ISO Prolog. Thanks to its declarative nature, it can be used both as a modelling language for the description of problems and as a general purpose programming language. Beyond the basic Prolog data types, the following are available: strings, unlimited precision integer and rational numbers, and floating point intervals. Array syntax and structures with field names are also supported and especially useful in constraint modelling. A logical iteration construct eliminates the need for most simple recursion patterns. ECLiPSe provides comprehensive facilities to implement data-driven control behaviour. These include declarative delay-clauses as well as primitives for meta-programmed control like explicit goal suspension, flexible triggering facilities and execution priorities. Together with the attributed variable data type, this is the key to many extensions to the basic logic programming language, including all constraint-based functionality. The system calls user-definable event handlers when it encounters attributed variables in certain contexts, e.g. unification. The module system controls the visibility of predicates, non- logical stores, source transformations and syntax settings. Module interfaces can be extended and restricted, and modules written in different language dialects can be mixed within one application. Programs may contain structured comments from which reference documentation can be generated. Libraries ECLiPSe provides several libraries of constraint solvers which can be used in application programs: Arithmetic constraints over finite domains, finite set constraints, generalized propagation, interval reasoning over non-linear constraints, interfaces to external simplex solvers, constraint handling rules (CHR) and more. Other libraries implement search methods like branch-and- bound, repair-based search, limited discrepancy search. ECLiPSe interfaces to external solvers, in particular the COIN-OR, CPLEX, Gurobi and Xpress-MP linear and mixed-integer programming solvers, and the Gecode solver library. Compatibility libraries for ISO Prolog and other Prolog dialects (C-Prolog, Quintus, SICStus, SWI-Prolog) enable the reuse of libraries written in those dialects. Other utility libraries, including a number of popular public domain ones, are included in the distribution. System Architecture The system includes an incremental compiler which translates source code into virtual machine code. The compiler optimizes index selection, unification order, inlining of control constructs and can take mode information into account. The runtime system implements the virtual machine, automatic memory management with garbage collection of stacks and dictionary, event handling and data- driven execution. Versions of ECLiPSe implement OR-parallelism. ECLiPSe components can be integrated into software via a low-level C or C++ interface, or via high-level interfaces to Java and Tcl.

The term is specific to Mexico and Central America, and derives from the Nahuatl word chapolin (singular) or chapolimeh (plural). They are collected only at certain times of year (from their hatching in early May through the late summer/early autumn). They are toasted on a comal. Often they are seasoned with garlic, lime juice and salt, sometimes with an extract of Maguey worms, lending a sour-spicy-salty taste to the finished product. One of the regions of Mexico where chapulines are most widely consumed is Oaxaca, where they are sold as snacks at local sports events and are becoming revived among foodies.\\"Chapulines and Food Choices in Rural Oaxaca\\". Jeffrey H. Cohen, Nydia Delhi Mata Sanchez, and Francisco Montiel-Ishino. Gastronomica. Vol (90)1: 61-65, 2009. There is one reference to grasshoppers that are eaten in early records of the Spanish conquest, in early to mid 16th century.Fray Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, General History of the Things of New Spain: Florentine Codex, Book 11 Earthly Things Besides Oaxaca, chapulines are popular in areas surrounding Mexico City, such as Tepoztl√°n, Cuernavaca and Puebla. They may be eaten individually as a botana (snack) or as a filling, e.g. tlayuda filled with chapulines. The Seattle Mariners successfully introduced chapulines as a novelty snack in their 2017 home games.

History The group originated in Houston, Texas and began in 1966 as a folk rock group called The Bostwick Vines. They changed their name to Fever Tree a year later after the addition of keyboard player Rob Landes. The band briefly entered the public consciousness when their song \\"San Francisco Girls (Return of the Native)\\" reached No. 91 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1968. Like most of the band's material, it was written by the couple of Scott and Vivian Holtzman, who also were their producers. This four-minute track captured all the band's trademarks: Dennis Keller's incantation-like vocals, the quick shifting between slow parts with an almost sacral feeling and faster, more rock-oriented parts, and especially the searing guitar work by Michael Knust. Fever Tree also released their self- titled debut album, Fever Tree, in 1968, which charted at No. 156 on the Billboard 200 Chart. A second album, Another Time, Another Place, followed in 1969 and peaked at No. 83 with a third album Creation, charting at No. 97 on the Billboard 200 Chart in 1970. After \\"San Francisco Girls\\", they never had another hit, although they later also tried writing songs themselves when they had dropped the Holtzmans as producers. The group disbanded in 1970, but reformed in 1978 with only guitarist Michael Knust remaining from the original line-up. The new formation of the group had little commercial success; Fever Tree was not heard of again until 2003 when Michael Knust died. Fever Tree's first two albums (Fever Tree and Another Time, Another Place) were re-released as a single CD on October 31, 2006. Fever Tree's third and fourth albums (Creation and For Sale) are also available as a single CD. Their recording of \\"Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won't Do)\\" by Steve Cropper, Eddie Floyd, and Wilson Pickett was sampled as the primary riff in Madvillain's \\"America's Most Blunted\\" from their 2004 self-titled debut. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Fever Tree among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

While volunteering as a nurse, she cared for Soviet forces, and assisted them escaping. For this she was executed by German forces. Biography Masha Bruskina lived in Minsk with her mother, senior goods manager of the Book Trade Office of the BSSR State Publishing House. She studied well and read a lot. She was also a pioneer leader and a member of the school committee of Komsomol. in December 1938, the newspaper Pioneer of Belarus published a photograph of Masha with the caption: \\"Masha Bruskina - the schoolgirl of 8th grade in school ‚Ññ 28, Minsk. She has only good and excellent marks in all subjects\\". In June 1941, Maria Bruskina graduated from Minsk secondary school ‚Ññ 28. The execution She volunteered as a nurse at the hospital in the Minsk Polytechnic Institute, which had been set up to care for wounded members of the Red Army. In addition to caring for the soldiers, she helped them escape by smuggling civilian clothing and false identity papers into the hospital. A patient told the Germans what Bruskina was doing, and she was arrested on October 14, 1941, by members of the Wehrmacht's 707th Infantry Division and the 2nd Schutzmannschaft Battalion,USA v KAZYS CIURINSKAS Lithuanian auxiliary troops under the command of Major Antanas Impuleviƒçius. After being arrested, Bruskina wrote a letter to her mother on October 20, 1941: Local German authorities decided on a public hanging to make an example of Bruskina, along with two other members of the resistance, 16-year-old Volodia Shcherbatsevich and World War I veteran Kiril Trus. Before being hanged, she was paraded through the streets with a placard around her neck which read, in both German and Russian: \\"We are partisans and have shot at German troops\\". Members of the resistance were made to wear similar signs whether or not they had actually shot at German troops. She and her two comrades were hanged in public on Sunday, October 26, 1941, in front of Minsk Kristall, a yeast brewery and distillery plant on Nizhne-Lyahovskaya Street (15 Oktyabrskaya Street today). The Germans let the bodies hang for three days before allowing them to be cut down and buried. A witness of the execution said: Olga Shcherbatsevich, the mother of Volodia Shcherbatsevich, was hanged the same day as her son with two other members of the resistance in front of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus.A Historical Injustice: the case of Masha Bruskina; by Nechama Tec and Daniel Weiss, University of Connecticut in Stamford, Johns Hopkins University Holocaust and Genocide Studies; 1997 11(3):366-377; Identification and remembrance For decades after the war, Bruskina was officially referred to only as \\"the unknown girl\\", allegedly due to antisemitism from Soviet authorities.

It lies on the Wakefield Line and the Dearne Valley Line, north of Sheffield and is served by Northern. The station was opened in May 1879, jointly by the Midland Railway and North Eastern Railway, as part of their Swinton and Knottingley Joint Railway scheme. A short chord was also built at the same time to link the S&K; Joint line with the main Doncaster to Leeds line at South Kirkby Junction. Upon opening, Moorthorpe marked the northern limit of the part of the line maintained by the Midland Railway; the southern end of the intersection bridge over the Doncaster to Leeds line, marked the actual boundary. North of that point, the North Eastern Railway undertook the maintenance. Moorthorpe station is of North Eastern Railway design, as is Pontefract Baghill. This latter connection is now part of the main line between Sheffield and Leeds, and is used by CrossCountry services between Edinburgh Waverley and Birmingham New Street, and beyond. In addition, local trains on the Leeds ‚Äì Rotherham Central ‚Äì Sheffield route (Wakefield Line) use the spur and call at the station. This connecting line is now effectively the main line, and it splits from the S & K route immediately north of the station, with the track to York then bridging the GNR main line on its way northwards. This junction (and the adjacent loops to the south of the station) was controlled from the nearby Midland Railway signal box until May 2011, but following signalling equipment renewal work the area is now under the control of the ROC at York.\\"Moorthorpe and Hickleton Area Signalling Renewals\\"Network Rail Consulting; Retrieved 18 November 2016 After the station was reduced to the status of an unstaffed halt in the 1980s, the station building was converted into a pub. This closed in the early 1990s and the building became derelict. However it has recently been restored by the town council, with funding from the Railway Heritage Trust, to include office space and a cafe. A footbridge was opened at the station at the end of May 2010; previously passengers had to cross the tracks at a flat crossing. Services Monday to Saturdays, an hourly service operates from Moorthorpe to Leeds via Wakefield Westgate and to Sheffield. An hourly service also runs on Sundays. Three trains each way operate on the Dearne Valley line to York and Sheffield Mondays to Saturdays, with two each way on Sundays.GB eNRT December 2019 Edition, Tables 31 & 33 The station is less than away from South Elmsall railway station which means the South Kirkby/South Elmsall area has a half- hourly service to Leeds.

Life He was the younger son of Joseph Andrews of Shaw House, near Newbury in Berkshire, and his second wife Elizabeth Pettit; Sir Joseph Andrews, 1st Baronet (1727‚Äì1800) was his elder brother. He was educated privately, and having taken to the law was one of the magistrates at the police court in Queen Square, Westminster, from 1792 to his death. Andrews built himself the Strawberry Hill Gothic mansion of Donnington Grove, near the family home, in 1763, designed by John Chute. He sold the house in 1783. He was a regular participant in the work of the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor in the 1780s. Andrews died at Brompton and was buried in Hampstead Church. Works His major work was a History of Great Britain connected with the Chronology of Europe from Caesar's Invasion to Accession of Edward VI, in 2 volumes (London, 1794-1795).

The company is part of ACCO Brands. Its headquarters are in Lake Zurich, Illinois. ACCO's brands include GBC, Quartet, Swingline, AT-A-GLANCE, Day-Timer, Mead, FiveStar and many others. Company history General Binding Corporation (GBC) supplies machines and material for binding documents, laminating, and displaying products. A merger with Fortune Brands Inc.'s ACCO World Corporation was completed in August 2005, forming ACCO Brands. =Founding, overseas growth= GBC was founded in 1947 by William N. Lane II and two business partners when they purchased a small trade bindery in Chicago, Illinois. First year sales totaled $250,000. GBC expanded operations in 1952, opening another domestic manufacturing plant and founding General Binding Corporation Canada, Ltd. In the 1950s GBC laid the groundwork for its international divisions, creating sales and distribution networks in Europe, Mexico, Canada, Venezuela, and Brazil. Sales were slow at first in the European market, where GBC's binding machines were readily available but supplies were not. In response to this situation, GBC established a manufacturing subsidiary in Switzerland in 1954 to produce a full range of plastic binding supplies as well as a limited number of binding machines. Wholly owned subsidiaries were then set up to market GBC machines and supplies throughout England, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and France. In 1958, the European Economic Community established a 30 percent tariff on goods produced in Switzerland and sold throughout Europe. To avoid hefty tariffs, GBC built a second European manufacturing facility in Germany, just across the border from its Swiss concern. One year later, when labor shortages in Switzerland sharply curtailed production at GBC's plant there, the company built a third European manufacturing facility in England. =1960s and 1970s= In 1960, GBC introduced the Combo, its first combination punch/binding system. GBC also continued its international expansion, becoming one of the first foreign companies to set up operations in Japan. Three years later, the company established a fourth European manufacturing plant in Italy. Again, GBC's profits were threatened by high taxes, so the company built an automated plant in a newly created Italian economic development zone that had a lower tax rate. When the Australian government levied high import tariffs on GBC products in 1966, the company established an Australian manufacturing facility and purchased a Sydney-based firm to manufacture binding supplies from raw materials exported from the United States. This persistence in expanding its international sales garnered GBC a U.S. government \\"E\\" Award for excellence in exporting in 1964. GBC also established a wholly owned subsidiary in Brazil in 1962. Due to the unstable political situation in the country at that time, however, the company refrained from doing business there until 1971, when it entered into a joint venture with a Brazilian firm to distribute its products. Sales from 1961 to 1971 rose an average of $2.1 million a year, 30 percent of which came from foreign markets. GBC's domestic sales also expanded greatly, fueled by growth in the office market as well as a surge in the printing and graphics industry. In 1962, GBC purchased Virginia Laminating, a designer and manufacturer of lamination machines. In 1969, GBC purchased Webtron Corp., a maker of specialty presses used for printing tags and labels, and set it up as a wholly owned subsidiary. GBC went public in 1966, listing its securities on the OTC (over the counter) market. Stocks split two-for-one in 1968 and again in 1971. The company declared its first cash dividend in 1975. Sales in 1973 surpassed $50 million for the first time, and Therm-A-Bind, a new heat- activated binding system, was introduced. In 1977 GBC purchased U.S. RingBinder Corporation. GBC founder, Chairman, and CEO William N. Lane died in 1978. The Lane family retained control of 57 percent of the company and William N. Lane III was named chairman. Sales in 1978 hit the $100 million mark but began to slip around 1981, due to the economic recession in the United States. =Computer sales= In an attempt to boost earnings, GBC entered into an agreement with NorthStar Computers to sell its personal computers through GBC's established distribution and sales channels. The move proved to be nearly disastrous for GBC. Its sales force devoted the majority of its efforts toward selling new computers under the GBC name. IBM introduced a personal computer in 1981, and within two years cornered the market. In 1983, GBC sold fewer than 500 computers. Earnings fell to $236,000 on sales of $145.7 million, compared with 1981 earnings of $7.5 million on sales of $149.6 million. =1970s and 1980s= GBC's subsidiary U.S. RingBinder was facing competition from lower priced imports in the metal ringbinder industry. By 1983 U.S. RingBinder had resorted to selling its products at no gross margin in order to stave off its eroding market share. GBC's second subsidiary Webtron also was feeling the squeeze of competition. In 1984, Rudolph Grua was hired to replace John Preschlack as president and CEO. Under Grua, the company began a back-to-basics marketing effort, dropping its computer line and focusing on its core binding and lamination businesses. Faced with growing threats from European and Japanese imports, Grua earmarked $1.4 million for research and development of new binding and laminating systems and shredders. GBC introduced a number of new products and instituted a combined direct-mail, catalog, and telemarketing drive for its binding and office supplies. U.S. RingBinder became competitive again by establishing a manufacturing plant in Singapore. Sales in 1984 rose 13 percent to $165 million; net earnings soared to $6.4 million. In 1985, GBC entered into an agreement with VeloBind, Inc., of Sunnyvale, California, which had developed an innovative binding system using rigid plastic strips, paired along the spine and connected by prongs. The company broadened its marketing efforts, introducing an expanded product catalog named Sourcebook and establishing a telemarketing center at corporate headquarters in Northbrook, Illinois. The following year, telemarketing centers were established in England, Australia, and Canada. In 1987, with sales of more than $200 million, GBC stocks split 3-for-2 and dividends increased by 20 percent. In 1988 stocks split 3-for-2 again, earnings jumped 55 percent to $14 million, and sales hit a record $250 million. =1990s= GBC continued its expansion into the 1990s, establishing a new Film Products Division in 1989 and also purchasing Loose Leaf Metals Co., Inc., that year. The company also began tapping into the growing desktop publishing and home office market. In 1991, the Film Products Division introduced a high-speed commercial laminating system, which established GBC as a complete marketer of paper finishing products. Also that year, GBC purchased VeloBind, Inc., for approximately $50 million. Research and development spending continued, resulting in the introduction of 14 new products in 1992, including binding machines, improved Therm-A-Bind systems, and shredding machines. The next year, GBC entered the office supply business with the acquisition of Bates Manufacturing Company. As it moved toward the beginning of the 21st century, GBC planned to focus on improving its international markets, which were hurt by recessions in the overseas operations. In 1993 international sales accounted for 45 percent of unit sales but only 36 percent of dollar sales. With a focus on developing its Mexican and Australian markets, GBC looked for continued growth and profitability. In 1994, GBC purchased Michigan-based Sickinger Co., a maker of high-volume paper punching machines. Seeking to cut manufacturing costs, the company entered into two joint ventures in China and built a plant in Costa Rica. Concurrently plants in Germany and Mexico City were shut down. Revenue for the year climbed 12 percent to $420.4 million. Earnings were up 5 percent to $15.7 million. Govi C. Reddy, 18-year GBC veteran and head of the laminating film division, stepped up to the posts of president and CEO in January 1995. Under his leadership the division's annual revenue had grown from $6 million in the late 1980s to $63 million in 1994. Reddy's goal was to boost GBC total revenues to $1 billion by 2000, according to Crain's Chicago Business. As a part of his quest, Reddy ventured into the digital graphics market, with the purchase of Wisconsin-based Pro-Tech in late 1995. He also restructured operations and invested $20 million in the company's information system. The company gained Australian market leadership in office supplies with the acquisition of Fordiograph Inc. The Sydney-based company had sales of $21 million in 1995. The majority of the company stock remained with the Lane family. Lane Industries Inc. held 62 percent of the common stock with Ariel Capital Management, a mutual fund business, holding 11 percent. Lane Industries controlled all Class B voting stock. The stock had been confined to the $18 to $23 range for a number of years due to the less than stellar results from commodity product ventures such as three-ring binders, computers, and desktop supplies, according to Crain's. GBC purchased Quartet Manufacturing, a visual communication product maker in 1997. U.S. RingBinder was divested in 1998, putting the proceeds toward debt reduction. The company was paring itself down to four core business areas of office products, document finishing, films, and emerging markets. Record sales of $922.4 million, a 20 percent increase over 1997, were achieved in 1998. Net income dropped off due to a downturn in document finishing and digital print finishing businesses; charges related to three new manufacturing plants and the closure of two others; implementation of new distribution and information management systems in Europe; and costs related to the purchase of Ibico AG. =Losses and restructuring= April 1999 announcements of a first quarter earnings decline of 82 percent and a workforce reduction resulted in a 26 percent hit to GBC's stock price. Domestic sales of office supplies were soft and the ongoing integration problems related to the February 1998 buyout of Switzerland-based Ibico AG contributed to the fall-off. The restructuring, which also included a plant closing in Phoenix, the elimination of about 24 field sales offices, and the shuttering of warehouses in Dallas and Atlanta, was expected to save the company about $16 million annually. GBC recorded a net loss of $56.7 million for the year, and its stock fell to the $12 level, a 68 percent drop-off. =2000s= GBC returned to profitability in 2000, with $2.4 million in net earnings. In February 2001, Reddy retired. Lane also stepped down as chair in 2001, making room for new leadership. Dennis J. Martin came aboard as chairman, president, and CEO in May 2001. He planned to cut unprofitable products, reduce debt accumulated during the 1990s acquisition spree, and cut overhead. Martin had headed up the $1 billion welding products group for conglomerate Illinois Tool Works Inc. By the summer of 2003, Martin had reduced product offerings from more than 30,000 to less than 10,000. Instead of producing a slew of models for a piece of equipment such as a paper shredder, GBC began limiting them to the ones favored by high- volume customers. With a decrease in product offerings came a corresponding reduction in sales volume, factories, major distribution centers, and workers. In addition, Martin pushed for the development of technically advanced products. Martin's plan proceeded in a time of economic recession, taking hold in 2001. Corporate spending and hiring was off from the level that created strong demand for GBC products during the 1990s. GBC responded by outsourcing to low-cost facilities and entering the retail mass market. Annual sales were around the $700 million mark in 2003 and red ink continued to plague GBC's bottom line despite increased efficiency. \\"I don't think the company is losing marketshare to competitors in most of its business lines,\\" Walter Liptak, a KeyBank Capital Markets/McDonald Financial Group analyst told Crain's Chicago Business in May 2004. \\"It's just that corporate spending remains weak. And until demand rises, the company won't be able to raise its prices much, either.\\" GBC regained its footing in 2004, producing its most profitable year since 1998. Year-end debt was at its lowest level since 1996. =ACCO merger= In March 2005, Fortune Brands Inc. announced plans to spin off its Illinois-based ACCO World Corporation office products unit. ACCO would be merged with GBC, creating the world's largest supplier of branded office products with a combined revenue of nearly $2 billion. ACCO's Swingline brand was the North American leader in stapling and punches and ACCO was the leader in clips and fasteners. Shareholders of both Fortune Brands and GBC were to receive shares in the newly created company. Fortune shareholders would own 66 percent and GBC shareholders 34 percent. The merger deal drove up GBC shares by 62 percent from mid-March to the beginning of June. ACCO's profit margins had been under pressure from volume purchasers such as OfficeMax Inc. and Staples Inc. Fortune had attempted to sell ACCO in 2001, but shifted direction when no satisfactory offers were put forth. Cost-cutting and streamlining distribution and production operations produced a turnaround, but contribution to Fortune's overall sales and earnings continued to be limited, according to the Chicago Tribune. =Cosmo Films, India= Cosmo Films Ltd of New Delhi, India in January 2009 announced acquisition of GBC Commercial Print Finishing business from ACCO Brands Corporation. GBC reported $100 million in annual revenues at the time of acquisition. Cosmo Films is a manufacturer and exporter of BOPP and thermal lamination films and has own global sales of $140 million. The company chairman, Ashok Jaipuria, said that the combination of Cosmo Films and the GBC Commercial print finishing business would maximize the strengths of both organizations paving way for a vertically integrated, financially robust organization with broad management, sales and technical expertise. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2009, and is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals.

Theodotus was an able general, and repulsed with ease the first attack made by the king of Syria upon his province, but instead of being rewarded by Ptolemy for his services, he was recalled to Alexandria, where he nearly fell a victim to the intrigues of some of the courtiers and favourites of the king. Disgusted with this treatment, and despising the vices and luxury of Ptolemy, when he did resume command in Coele-Syria (219 BC), Theodotus conceived the idea of passing that province into the hands of Antiochus. His overtures were readily welcomed, and he surrendered the two important fortresses of Tyre and Ptolemais to the Seleucid monarch, whom he immediately joined with the forces under his command. Another of Ptolemy's generals, Nicolaus, prevented Theodotus' plans from being fully effected, and he was able to retain a part of the Syrian provinces under the allegiance of Egypt. Theodotus enjoyed a high place in the favour with the Syrian king. In the campaign of 217 BC, Theodotus commanded a body of ten thousand select troops, and just before the Battle of Raphia he demonstrated his daring by penetrating with only two companions into the heart of the Egyptian camp, in order to assassinate Ptolemy himself. Mistaking the king's tent, Theodotus slew Ptolemy's physician instead, but escaped safely, returning to the Syrian camp. Again in 215 BC Theodotus exhibited equal audacity in supporting the daring project of Lagoras to scale the walls of the city of Sardis, the success of which seems to have been in great measure owing to Theodotus' skill and ability.

Story In the game, players must assemble a group of six adventurers and journey across the kingdom of Deruvia to keep the demon Dreax imprisoned in the eponymous magic candle, which has begun to melt. The game's world includes several towns and cities, two castles, and several dungeons and towers. Unlike many computer games, one wins not by defeating a final enemy, but by collecting the necessary items and learning the necessary chants in order to preserve the magic candle. Players begin with one adventurer, a human hero called Lukas. Additional adventurers can be found in the game's two castles. Much of The Magic Candle's fun derives from discovering exactly what is needed to preserve the eponymous candle. However, if the candle melts and Dreax escapes, there is no consequence. Races There are five races available in this game: *Dwarves - Very short but exceptionally strong. *Elves - Tall and slender with special attachment to the forests. *Halflings - Small charismatic race with large furry feet. *Man - Or Human. *Wizards - Wizards are considered a race in this game. This race is similar to the race of Man, but practices magic. Professions *Carpenter - Can build shelter for camping. *Fighter - Skilled in combat. *Gem-Cutter - Gain extra 1/3 profits from gem sales. *Knight - Skilled both in combat and in defense. *Mage - Skilled in Magic. Only Wizards can be mages. *Mercenary - Offer their services for hire. *Metal Smith - Repairs weapons faster. *Ranger - Good hunters and move well in unknown terrain. This is Lukas' profession. *Tailor - Can make and repair garments. Good for getting jobs in towns. Realism The Magic Candle is known to have several traits that increase the realism of the game and of the world of Deruvia: *Party splitting - Players can split their party into several different groups and have each of them perform a different task, including working at different jobs to earn money in a town. *Wear and tear - Weapons accumulate wear and tear, and even break if not maintained properly. *Hunger and fatigue - Characters need to eat, rest, and sleep in order to remain healthy. *Residences - Players can't go barging into a private home. They have to knock on the door, and know the name of the residence owner. *Time factor - Shops close during the night and re-open at dawn. NPCs can be in different places at different times of the day. Japan Release Japanese company StarCraft, which specialized in localizing Western CRPGs, ported The Magic Candle to the Japanese PC-9801 computer. The port was released in May 1991, two years after the original release, with completely redesigned art and interfaces. Reception The Magic Candle was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #148 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. Scorpia of Computer Gaming World in 1989 gave the game a very positive review, noting that killed monsters tend to stay dead, a welcome change from the \\"endless wave\\" of other CRPGs. Criticisms included the relatively slow combat and the inability to quickly find people or shops in town. The magazine later recognized it as 1989's Role-Playing Game of the Year, describing it as \\"extensive, well-written, and balanced\\". In 1993 Scorpia approved of the \\"superior nonviolent ending\\" and stated that the 1989 award was well-deserved. Scorpia in 1993 was more critical of The Magic Candle III, with objections including a shortage of money at the start forcing the player to grind instead of questing, and imbalanced dungeons. She concluded that it \\"is a dull game\\" which failed to meet the expectations the first one set, \\"only for the hard- core fan of the series\\", and ended the series \\"on a mediocre note\\". The editors of Game Player's PC Strategy Guide gave The Magic Candle their 1989 \\"Best PC Fantasy Role-Playing Game\\" award. They wrote, \\"Richly inventive, smoothly playable, filled with user-friendly attention to detail, The Magic Candle stands out dramatically in a very crowded field.\\" Legacy The Magic Candle was successful enough to have sequels: The Magic Candle II: The Four and Forty (1991), and The Magic Candle III (1992). The Keys to Maramon (1990) was an action-title spinoff. Bloodstone: An Epic Dwarven Tale, released in 1993, is a prequel to The Magic Candle. The series also spawned two spin-offs: Siege (1992) and its sequel Ambush at Sorinor (1993) are tactical strategy games, both taking place in the world of The Magic Candle.

After graduating from RWTH Aachen University with a diploma in mechanical engineering, Theissen joined BMW in the engine calculation department in 1977. Over the following years he took on various responsibilities in BMW's engine development division and in 1989 gained a doctorate in engineering from the Ruhr University in Bochum. In 1991 he was made head of Product Concepts at BMW and a year later became Director of Advanced Drivetrain Development. In 1994 he was promoted to Director of BMW Technik GmbH. In 1998, in addition to his job as head of BMW Technik, he took on the task of setting up the BMW Technology Office in Palo Alto, California. He became BMW Motorsport Director alongside Gerhard Berger in April 1999 with oversight of BMW's Formula One team and other motorsport activities, including BMW's factory entries in the World Touring Car Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. BMW entered Formula One with a partnership agreement with Williams Racing in 1998. In 2001, BMW was credited with having the most powerful engine on the grid. While achieving notable successes, such as a strong championship challenge in 2003, the relationship between team and engine maker began to deteriorate. During the course of the 2004 and 2005 F1 seasons, Theissen increasingly became publicly critical of the Williams team's inability to create a package capable of winning the constructor's championship or even multiple victories within a single season. However, Williams blamed BMW for not producing a good enough engine. This public deterioration of the relationship between BMW and Williams, and between Theissen and Patrick Head in particular, was a factor in BMW's decision to buy Sauber. Theissen was made team principal of the resulting BMW Sauber team, and in their first season, they achieved 5th in the constructors championship, both a considerable improvement on Sauber's previous season and a match for Williams' previous position in the standings. In 2007 the BMW Sauber team finished 2nd in the World Constructors Championship after McLaren-Mercedes were excluded following a spying episode. In the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix Robert Kubica led Nick Heidfeld to finish first and second, giving BMW its first victory as a constructor. After BMW's decision to sell the team back to Peter Sauber and depart from Formula 1, Theissen decided to leave the sport as well but retain his position as BMW Motorsport Director. Theissen retired from BMW on 30 June 2011, to be replaced by Jens Marquardt.

Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des S√©ances de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences, volume 65, pages 102‚Äì104. In fact, in 1855, before working with magnesium compounds, Stanislas Sorel first developed a two-component cement by mixing zinc oxide powder with a solution of zinc chloride.Sorel Stanislas (1856).

In a few minutes he obtained a dense material harder than limestone. Only a decade later, Sorel replaced zinc with magnesium in his formula and also obtained a cement with similar favorable properties. This new type of cement was stronger and more elastic than Portland cement, and therefore exhibited a more resilient behavior when submitted to shocks. The material could be easily molded like plaster when freshly prepared, or machined on a lathe after setting and hardening. It was very hard, could be easily bound to many different types of materials (good adhesive properties), and colored with pigments. Therefore, it was used to make mosaics and to mimic marble. After mixing with cotton crushed in powder, it was also used as a surrogate material for ivory to fabricate billiard balls resistant to shock. Sorel cement is a mixture of magnesium oxide (burnt magnesia) with magnesium chloride with the approximate chemical formula Mg4Cl2(OH)6(H2O)8, or MgCl2¬∑3Mg(OH)2¬∑8H2O, corresponding to a weight ratio of 2.5‚Äì3.5 parts MgO to one part MgCl2.Holleman, A.

Sorrell (1977, 1980) ‚Äì whose family name sounds quite similar to that of Stanislas Sorel ‚Äì also studied the topic and published works on the same family of oxychloride compounds based on zinc and magnesium, just as Sorel had done about 100 years before. The zinc oxychloride cement is prepared from zinc oxide and zinc chloride instead of the magnesium compounds. Composition and structure The set cement consists chiefly of a mixture of magnesium oxychlorides and magnesium hydroxide in varying proportions, depending on the initial cement formulation, setting time, and other variables. The main stable oxychlorides at ambient temperature are the so- called \\"phase 3\\" and \\"phase 5\\", whose formulas can be written as 3¬∑¬∑8 and 5¬∑¬∑8, respectively; or, equivalently, ¬∑4 and ¬∑4.Isao Kanesaka and Shin Aoyama (2001). \\"Vibrational spectra of magnesia cement, phase 3\\". Journal of Raman Spectroscopy, volume 32, issue 5, pages 361-367. Phase 5 crystallizes mainly as long needles which are actually rolled-up sheets. These interlocking needles give the cement its strength.B. Tooper and L. Cartz (1966). \\"Structure and Formation of Magnesium Oxychloride Sorel Cements\\". Nature, volume 211, pages 64‚Äì66. In the long term the oxychlorides absorb and react with carbon dioxide from the air to form magnesium chlorocarbonates.W. F. Cole and T. Demediuk (1955). \\"X-Ray, thermal, and Dehydration studies on Magnesium oxychlorides\\". Australian Journal of Chemistry, volume 8, issue 2, pages 234-251. History These compounds are the primary components of matured Sorel cement, first prepared in 1867 by Stanislas Sorel. In the late 19th century, several attempts were made to determine the composition of the hardened Sorel's cement, but the results were not conclusive.Davis J.W.C. (1872). \\"Composition of Crystalline Deposit from a Solution of Magnesium and Ammonium Chloride\\".

(1882). \\"Sur les oxychlorures de magn√©sium\\". Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des S√©ances de l'Acad√©mie des sciences, volume 94, pages 444‚Äì446. Phase 3 was properly isolated and described by Robinson and Waggaman (1909),W. O. Robinson and W. H. Waggaman (1909): \\"Basic magnesium chlorides\\". Journal of Physical Chemistry, volume 13, issue 9, pages 673‚Äì678. and phase 5 was identified by Lukens (1932).Lukens H.S. (1932). \\"The composition of magnesium oxychloride\\". Journal of the American Chemical Society, volume 54, issue 6, pages 2372‚Äì2380. Properties Sorel cement can withstand 10,000‚Äì12,000 psi (69‚Äì83 MPa) of compressive force whereas standard Portland cement can typically only withstand 7,000‚Äì8,000 psi (48‚Äì55 MPa). It also achieves high strength in a shorter time.Ronan M. Dorrepaal and Aoife A. Gowen (2018). \\"Identification of magnesium oxychloride cement biomaterial heterogeneity using Raman chemical mapping and NIR hyperspectral chemical imaging\\". Scientific Reports, volume 8, article number 13034. Sorel cement has a remarkable capacity to bond with, and contain, other materials. It also exhibits some elasticity, an interesting property increasing its capacity to resist shocks (better mechanical resilience), particularly useful for billiard balls. The pore solution in wet Sorel cement is slightly alkaline (pH 8.5 to 9.5), but significantly less so than that of Portland cement (hyperalkaline conditions: pH 12.5 to 13.5). Other differences between magnesium-based cements and portland cement include water permeability, preservation of plant and animal substances, and corrosion of metals. These differences make different construction applications suitable. Prolonged exposure of Sorel cement to water leaches out the soluble , leaving hydrated brucite as the binding phase, which without absorption of , can result in loss of strength.Amal Brichni, Halim Hammi, Salima Aggoun, and M'nif Adel (2016). \\"Optimization of magnesium oxychloride cement properties by silica glass\\". Advances in Cement Research (Springer conference proceedings). Fillers and reinforcement In use, Sorel cement is usually combined with filler materials such as gravel, sand, marble flour, asbestos, wood particles and expanded clays.Zongjin Li and C. K. Chau (2007). \\"Influence of molar ratios on properties of magnesium oxychloride cement\\". Cement and Concrete Research, volume 37, issue 6, pages 866-870. Sorel cement is incompatible with steel reinforcement because the presence of chloride ions in the pore solution and the low alkalinity (pH < 9) of the cement promote steel corrosion (pitting corrosion). However, the low alkalinity makes it more compatible with glass fiber reinforcement. It is also better than Portland cement as a binder for wood composites, since its setting is not retarded by the lignin and other wood chemicals. The resistance of the cement to water can be improved with the use of additives such as phosphoric acid, soluble phosphates, fly ash, or silica. Uses Magnesium oxychloride cement is used to make floor tiles and industrial flooring, in fire protection, wall insulation panels, and as a binder for grinding wheels. Due to its resemblance to marble, it is also used for artificial stones, artificial ivory (e.g. for billiard balls) and other similar purposes. Sorel cement is also studied as a candidate material for chemical buffers and engineered barriers (drift seals made of salt-concrete) for deep geological repositories of high-level nuclear waste in salt-rock formations (Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico, USA; Asse II salt mine, Gorleben and Morsleben in Germany). Phase 5 of the magnesium oxychloride could be a useful complement, or replacement, for MgO (periclase) presently used as a getter in the WIPP disposal chambers to limit the solubility of minor actinides carbonate complexes, while establishing moderately alkaline conditions (pH: 8.5‚Äì9.5) still compatible with the undisturbed geochemical conditions initially prevailing in situ in the salt formations. The much more soluble calcium oxide and hydroxide (portlandite) are not authorized in WIPP (New Mexico) because they would impose a too high pH (12.5). As is the second most-abundant cation present in sea water after , and that magnesium compounds are less soluble than these of calcium, magnesium-based buffer materials and Sorel cement are considered more appropriate backfil materials for radioactive waste disposal in deep salt formations than common calcium-based cements (Portland cement and their derivatives). Moreover, as magnesium hydroxychloride is also a possible pH buffer in marine evaporite brines, Sorel cement is expected to less disturb initial in situ conditions prevailing in deep salts formations.Bodine, M. W. Jr. (1976). \\"Magnesium hydroxychloride: A possible pH buffer in marine evaporite brines?\\" Geology, volume 4, issue 2, 76‚Äì80. Preparation Sorel cement is usually prepared by mixing finely divided powder with a concentrated solution of . In theory, the ingredients should be combined in the molar proportions of phase 5, which has the best mechanical properties. However, the chemical reactions that create the oxychlorides may not run to completion, leaving unreacted particles and/or in pore solution. While the former act as an inert filler, leftover chloride is undesirable since it promotes corrosion of steel in contact with the cement. Excess water may also be necessary to achieve a workable consistency. Therefore, in practice the proportions of magnesium oxide and water in the initial mix are higher than those in pure phase 5. In one study, the best mechanical properties were obtained with a molar ratio : of 13:1 (instead of the stoichiometry 5:1). Production Periclase (MgO) and magnesite () are not abundant raw materials, so their manufacture into Sorel cement is expensive and limited to specialized niche applications requiring modest materials quantities. China is the dominant supplier of raw materials for the production of magnesium oxide and derivatives. Magnesium-based \\"green cements\\" derived from the more abundant dolomite () deposits (dolostone), but also containing calcium carbonate, have not to be confused with the original Sorel cement, as this later does not contain calcium oxide. Indeed, Sorel cement is a pure magnesium oxychloride.

History Lombard College was founded in 1853 by the Universalist Church as the Illinois Liberal Institute. In 1855, however, a major fire damaged much of the college, placing its future at risk, but a large gift from Benjamin Lombard (1815‚Äì1882), a Massachusetts-born farmer and businessman, rescued the institution, rechristened as Lombard University. The official name of the school was changed to Lombard College. Lombard was coeducational from its founding, reflecting the Universalist philosophy. The institution was the seat of the Ryder School of Divinity from sometime in the 1880s until 1913. The very first chapter of the national sorority Alpha Xi Delta was also founded there in 1893. Lombard College was a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1910 to 1929. The Great Depression proved to be too much for Lombard; the last class was graduated in 1930. While Lombard did not merge, some of its students transferred to nearby Knox College, and its alumni activities take place at Knox. Sigma Nu fraternity's Delta Theta chapter, which formed at Lombard in 1867 as the Delta Theta Society and became a part of Sigma Nu in 1891, continues its activities at Knox to this day. Until 1973, the Alpha Chapter of Alpha Xi Delta also continued at Knox. The former Lombard College building and campus is currently used as Lombard Middle School.

Career Born in Bury, Lancashire, Shaw first played for his home club, Bury, and then Accrington Stanley, helping the side win the Lancashire Combination. Shaw then moved south to London, joining Woolwich Arsenal in 1907. He made his debut against Preston North End on 28 September 1907, and had soon become a regular in the Arsenal side; he was first-choice left back for the next seven seasons. Although the club had shown early promise since their promotion to the First Division in 1904, with two successive FA Cup semi-final appearances in the seasons before Shaw's arrival, they soon quickly faded. After a high of sixth place in 1908-09, Woolwich Arsenal soon found themselves in trouble, and were relegated in 1912-13. Despite this, Shaw stayed with the club as they moved across London to Highbury, and was an ever-present in the final 1914-15 season prior to first- class football being suspended for World War I. He continued to play during unofficial wartime matches, and by the time competitive football had resumed, he had made the switch to right back. In 1919 he was made Arsenal captain, succeeding the recently departed Percy Sands. By this time Arsenal were back in the First Division, and Shaw continued to play until the age of 38. In 1922 he had made his 300th first-class appearance against Newcastle United on 23 April 1921 becoming the third player in the club's history to do so, after Sands and Roddy McEachrane. In all he played 326 matches for the club, although he never scored a goal. After retiring from playing, he became first a coach, and then manager of the Arsenal reserve side. After the unexpected death of Herbert Chapman in January 1934, Shaw became caretaker manager of the first team for the rest of the season; Shaw carried on Chapman's good work, as Arsenal won the 1933-34 League title, the third title in the club's history. After George Allison was appointed permanent first-team manager in the summer, Shaw went back to his post as reserves manager. Shaw remained at Arsenal through the rest of the 1930s and during the Second World War. After the war ended, he had a stint as a coach at Chelsea, a spell which started at 1945 and lasted for the next two years. He then returned from Chelsea, towards Arsenal to become assistant manager to Tom Whittaker in 1947. He later served as a club ambassador and fully ended his footballing days in 1956, after 49 years' service for Arsenal. He died in 1963 at the age of 80.

Much scholarly work was collected in the great Library of Alexandria during this time. A lot of epic poetry, as well as works on geography, history, mathematics, astronomy and medicine were composed during this period. The name of Alexandrian school is also used to describe the religious and philosophical developments in Alexandria after the 1st century. The mix of Jewish theology and Greek philosophy led to a syncretic mix and much mystical speculation. The Neoplatonists devoted themselves to examining the nature of the soul, and sought communion with God. The two great schools of biblical interpretation in the early Christian church incorporated Neoplatonism and philosophical beliefs from Plato's teachings into Christianity, and interpreted much of the Bible allegorically. The founders of the Alexandrian school of Christian theology were Clement of Alexandria and Origen. History Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great about the time when Greece, in losing her national independence, lost also her intellectual supremacy, was well adapted for becoming the new centre of the world's activity and thought. Its situation brought it into commercial relations with all the nations lying around the Mediterranean, and at the same time it was the one communicating link with the wealth and civilization of the East. The natural advantages it enjoyed were increased to an enormous extent by the care of the sovereigns of Egypt. Ptolemy Soter (reigned 323‚Äì285 BC), to whom Egypt had fallen after the death of Alexander, began to draw around him from Greece a circle of men eminent in literature and philosophy. To these he gave aid for them to carry out their work. Under the inspiration of his friend Demetrius of Phalerum, the Athenian orator, statesman and philosopher, Ptolemy laid the foundations of the great Library of Alexandria and began the search for all written works, which resulted in such a collection as the world has seldom seen. He also built the Museum, in which, maintained by the state, the scholars resided, studied and taught. The Museum, or academy of science, was in many respects not unlike a modern university. The work begun by Ptolemy Soter was carried on by his descendants, in particular by his two immediate successors, Ptolemy Philadelphus and Ptolemy Euergetes. Philadelphus (285‚Äì247), whose librarian was the celebrated Callimachus, bought up all Aristotle's collection of books, and also introduced a number of Jewish and Egyptian works. Among these appears to have been a portion of the Septuagint. Euergetes (247‚Äì222) increased the library by seizing on the original editions of the dramatists from the Athenian archives, and by compelling all travellers who arrived in Alexandria to leave a copy of any work they possessed. This intellectual movement extended over a long period of years and can be split into two periods. The first period extends from about 306 to 30 BC, the time from the foundation of the Ptolemaic dynasty to the conquest by the Romans; the second extends from 30 BC to the destruction of the Alexandria Library sometime before or upon the capture of Alexandria by 'Amr ibn al-'As in 641 AD. The clear differences between these two periods explains the variety and vagueness of meaning attaching to the term \\"Alexandrian School.\\" In the first period the intellectual activity was of a literary and scientific nature. It was an attempt to continue and develop, under new conditions, the old Hellenic culture. This effort was particularly noticeable under the early Ptolemies. As we approach the 1st century BC, the Alexandrian school began to break up and to lose its individuality. This was due partly to the state of government under the later Ptolemies, partly to the formation of new scholarly circles in Rhodes, Syria and elsewhere. This gradual dissolution was much increased when Alexandria fell under Roman sway. As the influence of the school was extended over the whole Graeco-Roman world, scholars began to concentrate at Rome rather than at Alexandria. In Alexandria, however, there were new forces in operation, which produced a second great outburst of intellectual life. The new movement, which was influenced by Judaism and Christianity, resulted in the speculative philosophy of the Neoplatonists and the religious philosophy of the Gnostics and early church fathers. There appear, therefore, to be two Alexandrian schools distinct from each other. The one is the Alexandrian school of poetry and science, the other the Alexandrian school of philosophy. The term \\"school,\\" however, does not mean that there was company of people united by common principles or by having the same theory of things. In literature their activities were highly varied; they have only in common a certain spirit or form. There was no definite system of philosophy. Even in the later schools of philosophy there is a community of tendency rather than of fixed principles. Literature The character of the literature appears to be a consequence of the fall of Greek nationality and independence. The great Greek works had been the products of a fresh life of nature and perfect freedom of thought. All their hymns, epics and histories were bound up with their individuality as a free people. But the Macedonian conquest brought about a dissolution of this Greek life both private and political. The full, genial, spirit of Greek thought vanished when freedom was lost. A substitute for this originality was found at Alexandria in learned research, and extensive knowledge. Provided with means for acquiring information, the Alexandrians took this new direction in literature. Without the culture which could excite a true spirit of poetry, they devoted themselves to careful researches in all arts subordinate to proper literature. They studied criticism, grammar, prosody and metre, antiquities and mythology. The results of this study constantly appear in writings. Their works are never national, never addressed to a people, but to a circle of learned men. The very fact of being under the protection and in the pay of an absolute monarch damaged the character of their literature. There was introduced into it a courtly element. One other fact is that the same writer was frequently distinguished in several special disciplines. The most renowned poets were at the same time men of culture and science, critics, antiquarians, astronomers or physicians. To such writers the poetical form was merely a convenient vehicle for the exposition of the arts and sciences. The forms of poetry chiefly cultivated by the Alexandrians were epic and lyric, or elegiac. Great epics are wanting; but in their place are found the historical and the didactic or expository epics. The subjects of the historical epics were generally some of the well-known myths, in which the writer could show the full extent of his learning and his perfect command of verse. These poems are in a sense valuable as repertoires of antiquities; but their style is often bad, and great patience is required to clear up their numerous and obscure allusions. The best extant specimen is the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes; the most characteristic is the Alexandra or Cassandra of Lycophron, the obscurity of which is almost proverbial. The subjects of the didactic epics were very numerous; they seem to have depended on the special knowledge possessed by the writers, who used verse as a form for unfolding their information. Some, such as the lost poem of Callimachus, were on the origin of myths and religious observances; others were on special sciences. Thus we have two poems of Aratus, who, though not resident at Alexandria, was so thoroughly imbued with the Alexandrian spirit as to be included in the school; the one is an essay on astronomy, the other an account of the signs of the weather. Nicander of Colophon has also left us two epics, one on remedies for poisons, the other on the bites of venomous beasts. Euphorion and Rhianus wrote mythological epics. The spirit of all their productions is the same, that of learned research. They are distinguished by artistic form, purity of expression and strict attention to the laws of metre and prosody, qualities which, however good in themselves, do not compensate for want of originality, freshness and power. In their lyric and elegiac poetry there is much to admire. The extant specimens are not devoid of talent or of expression. Yet, for the most part, they either relate to subjects incapable of poetic treatment, where the writer's endeavour is rather to expound the matter fully than to render it poetically beautiful, or else expend themselves on short isolated subjects, generally myths, and are erotic in character. The earliest of the elegiac poets was Philitas of Cos. But the most distinguished was Callimachus, undoubtedly the greatest of the Alexandrian poets. Of his numerous works there remain to us only a few hymns, epigrams and fragments of elegies. Other lyric poets were Phanocles, Hermesianax, Alexander of Aetolia and Lycophron. Some of the best productions of the school were their epigrams. Several specimens survive, and the art of composing them was popular, as might be expected from the court life of the poets and their constant endeavours after terseness and neatness of expression. Of similar character were the parodies and satirical poems, of which the best examples were the Silloi of Timon and the Kinaidoi of Sotades. Dramatic poetry appears to have flourished to some extent. Extant are three or four varying lists of the seven great dramatists who composed the Alexandrian Pleiad. Their works have perished. A cruder kind of drama, the amoebaean verse, or bucolic mime, developed into the only pure stream of genial poetry found in the Alexandrian School, the Idylls of Theocritus. As the name of these poems suggests, they were pictures of fresh country life. Alexandrian poetry had a powerful influence on Roman literature. That literature, especially in the Augustan age, can only be understood by appreciating of the character of the Alexandrian school. The historians of this period were numerous and prolific. Many of them, such as Cleitarchus, devoted themselves to the life and achievements of Alexander the Great. The best-known names are those of Timaeus and Polybius. Before the Alexandrians had begun to produce original works, their researches were directed towards the masterpieces of ancient Greek literature. If that literature was to be a power in the world, it had to be handed down to posterity in a form capable of being understood. This was the task begun and carried out by the Alexandrian critics. These men did not merely collect works, but sought to arrange them, to subject the texts to criticism, and to explain any allusion or reference in them which at a later date might become obscure. They studied the arrangement of the texts; settlement of accents; theories of forms and syntax; explanations either of words or things; and judgments on the authors and their works, including all questions as to authenticity and integrity. The critics required a wide range of knowledge; and from this requirement sprang grammar, prosody, lexicography, mythology and archaeology. The service rendered by these critics is invaluable. To them we owe not merely the possession of the greatest works of Greek intellect, but the possession of them in a readable state. The most celebrated critics were Zenodotus; Aristophanes of Byzantium, to whom we owe the theory of Greek accents; Crates of Mallus; and Aristarchus of Samothrace, the coryphaeus of criticism. Others were Lycophron, Callimachus, Eratosthenes and many of a later age, for the critical school long survived the literary. Dionysius Thrax, the author of the first scientific Greek grammar, may also be mentioned. These philological labours were of great indirect importance, for they led to the study of the natural sciences, and in particular to a more accurate knowledge of geography and history. Considerable attention began to be paid to the ancient history of Greece, and to all the myths relating to the foundation of states and cities. A large collection of such curious information is contained in the Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus). Eratosthenes was the first to write on physical geography; he also first attempted to draw up a chronological table of the Egyptian kings and of the historical events of Greece. The sciences of mathematics, astronomy and medicine were also cultivated with assiduity and success at Alexandria, but they did not have their origin there, and did not, in any strict sense, form part of the peculiarly Alexandrian literature. The founder of the mathematical school was the celebrated Euclid; among its scholars were Archimedes; Apollonius of Perga, author of a treatise on Conic Sections; Eratosthenes, to whom we owe the first measurement of the earth; and Hipparchus, the founder of the epicyclical theory of the heavens, afterwards called the Ptolemaic system, from its most famous expositor, Claudius Ptolemy. Alexandria continued to be celebrated as a school of mathematics and science long after the Christian era. The science of medicine had distinguished representatives in Herophilus and Erasistratus, the two first great anatomists. Philosophy After the Roman conquest, pure literature bears the stamp of Rome rather than of Alexandria. But in Alexandria for some time there had been various forces working, and these, coming in contact with great spiritual changes in the world, produced a second outburst of intellectual activity, which is generally known as the Alexandrian school of philosophy. The doctrines of this school were a fusion of Eastern and Western thought, and combined in varying proportions the elements of Hellenistic and Jewish philosophy. The city of Alexandria had gradually become the neutral ground of Europe, Asia and Africa. Its population, then as at the present day, was a heterogeneous collection of all races. Alexander had planted a colony of Jews who had increased in number until at the beginning of the Christian era they occupied two-fifths of the city and held some of the highest offices. The contact of Jewish theology with Greek speculation became the great problem of thought. The Jewish ideas of divine authority and their transcendental theories of conduct were peculiarly attractive to the Greek thinkers who found no inspiration in the dry intellectualism of Hellenistic philosophy. At the same time the Jews had to some extent shaken off their exclusiveness and were prepared to compare and contrast their old theology with cosmopolitan culture. Thus the Hellenistic doctrine of personal revelation could be combined with the Jewish tradition of a complete theology revealed to a special people. The result was the application of a purely philosophical system to the somewhat vague and unorganized corpus of Jewish theology. According to the relative predominance of these two elements arose Gnosticism, the Patristic theology, and the philosophical schools of Neopythagoreanism and Neoplatonism. The first concrete exemplification of this is found in Aristobulus ( BC). So far as the Jews are concerned, the great name is that of Philo in the 1st century. He took Greek metaphysical theories, and, by the allegorical method, interpreted them in accordance with the Jewish Revelation. He dealt with (a) human life as explained by the relative nature of Humanity to God, (b) the Divine nature and the existence of God, and, (c) the great Logos doctrine as the explanation of the relation between God and the material universe. From these three arguments he developed a syncretism of oriental mysticism and pure Greek metaphysics. The first pure philosophy of the Alexandrian school was Neopythagoreanism, the second and last Neoplatonism. Their doctrines were a synthesis of Platonism, Stoicism and the later Aristotelianism with a dose of oriental mysticism which gradually became more and more important. The world to which they spoke had begun to demand a doctrine of salvation to satisfy the human soul. They endeavoured to deal with the problem of good and evil. They therefore devoted themselves to examining the nature of the soul, and taught that its freedom consists in communion with God, to be achieved by absorption in a sort of ecstatic trance. This doctrine reached its height with Plotinus; later followers emphasized theurgy in its unsuccessful combat with Christianity. Finally this pagan theosophy was driven from Alexandria back to Athens under Plutarch of Athens and Proclus, and occupied itself largely in commentaries based mainly on the attempt to re-organize ancient philosophy in conformity with the system of Plotinus. This school ended under Damascius when Justinian closed the Athenian schools (529). Neoplatonism had a considerable effect on certain Christian thinkers at the beginning of the 3rd century. Among these the most important were Clement of Alexandria and Origen. Clement, as a scholar and a theologian, proposed to unite the mysticism of Neoplatonism with the practical spirit of Christianity. He combined the principle of pure living with that of free thinking, and held that instruction must regard the mental capacity of the hearer. The compatibility of Christian and later Neoplatonic ideas is evidenced by the writings of Synesius, bishop of Ptolemais, and though Neoplatonism eventually succumbed to Christianity.

In John Law (Ed.), Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge? London, Routledge: 196-233. Obligatory passage points are a feature of actor-networks, usually associated with the initial (problematization) phase of a translation process. An OPP can be thought of as the narrow end of a funnel, that forces the actors to converge on a certain topic, purpose or question. The OPP thereby becomes a necessary element for the formation of a network and an action program. The OPP thereby mediates all interactions between actors in a network and defines the action program. Obligatory passage points allow for local networks to set up negotiation spaces that allow them a degree of autonomy from the global network of involved actors. If a project is unable to impose itself as a strong OPP between the global and local networks, it has no control over global resources such as financial and political support, which can be misused or withdrawn. Additionally, a weak OPP is unable to take credit for the successes achieved within the local network, as outside actors are able to bypass its control and influence the local network directly. An action program can comprise a number of different OPP's. An OPP can also be redefined as the problematization phase is revisited.

Developed by two leading French STS scholars, Michel Callon and Bruno Latour, Law himself, and others, ANT may alternatively be described as a 'material-semiotic' method.

In contrast with the centuries-old plucked psaltery, the bowed psaltery appears to be a 20th-century invention. History =Violin zither= In 1925 a German patent was issued to the Clemens Neuber Company for a bowed psaltery which also included a set of strings arranged in chords, so that one could play the melody on the bowed psaltery strings, and strum accompaniment with the other hand. These are usually called \\"violin zithers\\". =Ukelin-type instruments= 365px Similar instruments were being produced by American companies of the same time period, often with Hawaiian-inspired names, such as Hawaiian Art Violin or Violin-Uke, and marketed for use in playing the Hawaiian music, which was popular in the United States in the 1920s. These instruments are not typically referred to as psalteries, but by the various trade names they were sold under, such as Ukelin. =The conventional bowed psaltery= Today, the bowed psaltery is most often produced without chord accompaniment strings (though some modern players retune the chromatic side to produce chords, and play it in the manner of the violin zither). After the Second World War, Walter Mittman, a primary school teacher in Westphalia, popularized the conventional triangular bowed psaltery, which had earlier been advocated for use in education by the German Edgar Stahmer (1911‚Äì1996). Description A chromatic bowed psaltery. The construction style is often influenced by the looks of Medi√¶val plucked psalteries, as well as Gothic architecture. The conventional bowed psaltery is triangular in shape, allowing each string to extend a little farther than the one before it, so that each can be individually bowed. Chromatic bowed psalteries have the sharps and flats on one side and the diatonic notes on the opposite. It is a psaltery in the traditional sense of a wooden soundbox with unstopped strings over the soundboard. It significantly differs from the Medieval plucked psaltery only in that its strings are arranged to permit bowing. The soundboard has a soundhole or rose in the center. In the United States, it is normally played with a small bow, often made in the earlier semicircular style, whereas in Europe a reduced-size modern violin bow is used. 543px Method of playing Performance styles vary, but the instrument may be played either one note at a time, with the instrument held with one hand and bowed with the other, as in instruments of the violin family, or it may be laid down and played with a bow in each hand, in a style reminiscent of the closely related hammered dulcimer. Some players will also hold two bows in one hand to facilitate double- stopping. Besides bowing, the instrument may also be strummed or struck for additional tone colors. The strings are often too closely spaced for conventional finger picking, but may be plucked at the bowing end.

It is approximately by road from Kuching. Millions of years of erosion of the sandstone have created a coastline of steep cliffs, rocky headlands and stretches of white, sandy bays. Wave erosion at the base of the cliffs has carved many of the rocky headlands into fantastically shaped sea arches and seastacks with colored patterns formed by iron deposition. The most famous of them is shaped like a cobra's head which can be spotted on a boat ride from the headquarters or one of the beaches. Some of these rock formations can be seen on entry to the Teluk Assam Beach, which fronts the park. The park can only be reached by a 20-minute boat ride from the village of Kampung Bako. It is often visited as a day-trip from Kuching, though accommodations (campground and forestry service bungalows) are available. Bako is one of the smallest national parks in Sarawak. However, it features multiple biomes (including rainforest), abundant wildlife, jungle streams and waterfalls, secluded beaches, and trekking trails. A network of 16 marked walking trails of different lengths allows visitors access. In addition, various beaches are accessible by boat from Kampung Bako or Teluk Assam, as well as a geologically interesting sea stack rock formation. The range of attractions and activities in a compact area have made Bako one of the most popular parks in Sarawak. The park was the final pit stop of The Amazing Race Asia 1.

One of its strains is used commercially for the production of the single cell protein mycoprotein Quorn. Fusarium venenatum was discovered growing in soil in Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom, in 1967 by ICI as part of the effort during the 1960s to find alternative sources of food to fill the protein gap caused by the growing world population.From petri dish to plate: The ¬£172m fungi The Independent published 2005-06-07, accessed 2011-06-27 It was originally misidentified as Fusarium graminearum.Myco- protein from Fusarium venenatum: a well-established product for human consumption, M. Wiebe, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Volume 58, Number 4, 421-427, accessed 2011-06-27 The strain Fusarium venenatum A3/5 (IMI 145425, ATCC PTA-2684) was developed commercially by an ICI and Rank Hovis McDougall joint venture to derive a mycoprotein used as a food. Because the hyphae of the fungus are similar in length and width to animal muscle fibres the mycoprotein is used as an alternative to meat and is marketed to vegetarians as Quorn. It is also suitable as a substitute for fat in dairy products and a substitute for cereal in breakfast cereals and snacks.  Commercial production  Fusarium venenatum intended for use in Quorn products is grown under aerobic conditions in culture vessels by what is known as the 'Quorn Process'. The vessels are composed of two vertical cylinders around high, connected to one another at their top and bottom so as to form a continuous loop with a volume of about . Ports on the vessel allow the various ingredients involved to be added and removed. The culture broth is composed of 95% glucose, derived by the predigestion of maize starch. Potassium, magnesium and phosphate sources are added as a necessary mineral trace. Both these and the glucose are sterilized prior to use. Additional make up broth can be injected at the base of the vessel as material is removed. The broth is maintained at a pH of 6 and a temperature of 28‚Äì30 ¬∞C, with a biomass density of 15 grams per litre; equating to a total vessel biomass of 2,250 kg. As culture growth occurs, carbon dioxide is produced and released through a vent at the top of the loop. A heat exchanger, located in the union between the towers at their base, allows excess heat generated by the culture to be removed. One tower contains a sparge bar near the tower's base, through which air and ammonia are injected to provide the oxygen and nitrogen required for respiration and protein production. This sparging action causes the pair of towers to function as an air lift culture vessel. The broth continually circulates between the two towers; as it is driven upwards by the sparge bar in one tower, it falls in the opposing tower. Such a stirring (or circulating) method can be preferable for biological cultures as it is less likely to cause damage to cell membranes by mechanical compression or abrasion. The denser Fusarium venenatum culture falls to the base of the loop, where it is removed and Pasteurized. Filtration is used to harvest the Fusarium venenatum, with this then being dried prior to blending with a binder. The majority of Quorn products are bound by rehydrated egg white, which makes them unsuitable for a vegan diet. The complete vessels contain 230 tonnes of broth, as glucose is denser than water. 30 tonnes of the cultured broth are removed per hour. The culture density within the broth at filtration varies from 1.5% (the vessel's standard culture density) to 25‚Äì30% w/v, equating to a standard production rate of 292 hydrated kilograms per hour, or 7 hydrated metric tons per 24-hour cycle. This gives a vessel dilution rate of about 13% w/w per hour; the amount of broth and culture mass being removed and then made back up per hour, with respect to the total mass in the vessel. The dry mass contains 25% cell wall, 48% protein, 12% soluble carbohydrate and 12% fat. The total protein content varies from 43-85%.  Regulation  In the United Kingdom the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food approved mycoprotein for sale as a food in 1985.

Known locally as the 'Gates to the Valleys'. It is separated from Gwaelod Y Garth by the River Taff. Taff's Well is distinguished because it contains the only thermal spring in Wales. The tepid water is thought to rise along a fault-line from the Carboniferous Limestone, in somewhat similar manner to the warm springs at Bristol and Bath. Various religious groups regard it as a spiritual site. The Garth Mountain overlooks the village and was the inspiration for the fictional \\"Ffynnon Garw\\", featured in the book, and film The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain. Name The name \\"Taff's Well\\" is derived from the situation of the village alongside the River Taff and the presence of the warm spring within Taff's Well Park. Thermal spring Taff's Well Park (Parc Ffynnon Taf) is the site of the Taff's Well Thermal Spring, a well that reached its height of popularity for visitors to the village in the mid to late 1800s. It enjoys temperatures which average 21.6 degrees C. The Well at Taff's Well is Wales' only natural thermal spa.. Location Taff's Well is situated just off Junction 32 of the M4 Motorway and at the southern end of the A470. Though administratively represented by Rhondda Cynon Taff Council, Taff's Well is a commuter town for the City of Cardiff where many of its residents work.  Culture  = 19th century = Taff's Well grew into an important railway junction during the mid- to late nineteenth century, when Cardiff was a major global exporter of coal. Taff's Well is a growing community which includes numerous districts: Glan-Y-Llyn, Rhiw Ddar and Glan Y-Fordd; Ty-Rhillage centre that consists of Alfred's terrace, Anchor Street, Church Street, Garth Street, Yew Street and Ty Rhiw through which the Taff Trail runs. Taff's Well is next to Castell Coch, which overlooks Cardiff. = 20th century = The actor David Jason spent much time in Taff's Well and based the situation comedy Open All Hours based upon Arthur's shophttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2989409.stm which is one of many buildings to have been dismantled and sent to the St Fagan's Museum of Welsh Life. = 21st century = Taff's Well is the original location of the story that inspired the film The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, by Ivor Monger and Christopher Monger. Taff's Well has featured in the Sky sitcom Stella Starring Ruth Jones. The post office in Nantgarw is a filming location in the sitcom, although it is just outside the village.

Churches Taff's Well has two active churches: * The Anglican church of St Mary and St James dates from and is located on Church Street. It is a chapel of ease to St Michael's in Tongwynlais. The minister is Rev Zoe King. * The Nonconformist Taff's Well United Church is located on Cardiff Road. It was founded as a Wesleyan Methodist chapel and took on its current name when it merged with the Taff's Well Baptist Church in the late 20th century. The minister is Rev Cathy Gale. Like the neighbouring community of Tongwynlais, Taff's Well formerly had a number of other churches which have ceased to function and have either been converted into other purposes or been demolished: * The Tabor Calvinistic Methodist Church was built on what became Tabor Street in 1843. It was rebuilt in 1864. It closed in and is now a commercial premises. * The Glandwr Taf Welsh Independent Chapel was built in 1859. It was modified in 1898 (or 1895) and was rebuilt in 1905, being capable of seating 250. It is now a private residence. * The Tabernacle English Baptist Chapel on the corner of Garth and King Streets was built in 1906. Its congregation later merged to form Taff's Well United Church. After the merge, the chapel was demolished and the site is now occupied by housing.

He passed through the troubled times of the Republic and Empire with great political savvy, playing a decisive role at important times. Without achieving the notoriety of some of his more famous revolutionary colleagues, he held a number of key positions - President of the National Constituent Assembly (20 July - 1 August 1790), President of the National Convention (27 December 1792 ‚Äì 10 January 1793, coinciding with the trial of Louis XVI, three-time member of the Committee of Public Safety (7 April 1793 ‚Äì 12 June 1793; 31 July 1794 - 5 November 1794; 4 May 1795 ‚Äì 2 August 1795), chairman of the Council of Five Hundred, member of the French Directory. Eugene Marbeau describes Jean-Baptiste Treilhard as \\"a man honest and right, who is content to do his duty in the situation... but who does not seek... to dominate events\\". He is buried at the Panth√©on. Biography Born in Brive-la-Gaillarde, Corr√®ze, to a father who was a lawyer at the Pr√©sidial and maire perp√©tuel of Brive. Jean Baptiste was a student at the coll√®ge des doctrinaires (now the H√¥tel de Ville) at Brive, where he received an education balancing the requirements of science and faith. After studies in law, Jean-Baptiste Treilhard settled in Paris and became, in 1761, a lawyer at the Parlement. He was a prot√©g√© of Turgot, future Controller-General of Finances (24 August 1774 ‚Äì 12 May 1776) to Louis XVI. Treilhard was retained to care for judicial affairs of the Cond√© family. French Revolution Treilhard was elected deputy by the Third Estate of Paris to the Estates-General of 1789, then to the National Constituent Assembly. His most important early role was in the Comit√© eccl√©siastique (Ecclesiastical Committee) where he took the lead in promoting the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, a major reorganization of the Roman Catholic Church (including the suppression of its monasteries and the nationalization of its property). He served one term as President of the National Constituent Assembly (20 July - 1 August 1790). Ineligible, like all the members of the Constituent Assembly, for the Legislative Assembly, he became president of the criminal tribunal of Paris, but was judged as lacking of firmness. Elected to the National Convention by the department of Seine-et-Oise, Treilhard was President (27 December 1792 ‚Äì 10 January 1794) of the National Convention, and in this capacity served as first magistrate during a part of the trial of Louis XVI, in which he voted for death without reprieve. He was an inaugural member of the Committee of Public Safety (7 April 1793 ‚Äì 12 June 1793), but was excluded by the Montagnard. He is imprisoned, but will survive the Reign of terror. On 31 July 1794, after 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794), he returned to the Committee until 5 November 1794. He would serve again from 4 May to 2 August 1795. Treilhard served on three missions: * 17 June - 7 August 1793: to Gironde and Lot-et-Garonne, with fellow deputy Mathieu. * 22 September - 25 November 1793: to Marly (Seine-et-Oise, today Yvelines), with Auguis and Enlart * 30 December 1794 ‚Äì 4 April 1795: to Bec-d'Ambes (Gironde) and again the Lot-et-Garonne Directory Chairman of the Council of Five Hundred in the month of Niv√¥se, Year IV (22 December 1795 ‚Äì 23 January 1796). In his speech from 1 Pluviose year IV (21 January 1796), he delivered a speech on the third anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI, in which he execrated monarchy. In 1795, he arranged the exchange of the daughter of Louis XVI, Marie Th√©r√®se of France, future Duchess of Angoul√™me, who was a prisoner of the Republic since autumn 1792, for the commissioners to armies betrayed by the general Dumoriez and turned over to the Austrians in spring 1793. After refusing an appointment as ambassador to Naples in 1796, he served as a judge of the Court of Cassation (6 September - 23 October 1797), before the Directory of France appointed him minister plenipotentiary at the Congress of Rastadt in December 1797). Treilhard became one of five Directors, the chief executive body of France, 15 May 1798 (26 Flor√©al year VI) in replacement of Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau. He chaired the Directory 24 August - 27 November 1798. On 17 June 1799, his election as a member of the Executive Board is invalidated by a resolution of the Council of Ancients, on the grounds of ineligibility due to an irregularity in the election. He is succeeded by Louis-J√©r√¥me Gohier. Consulate and Empire Buste de Jean-Baptiste Treilhard -- Salle du serment du jeu de paume -- Versailles After the coup of 18 Brumaire (10 November 1799), during the Consulate, he was appointed on 4 April 1800 vice-president of the court of appeal of the department of the Seine, and became its president on 1 January 1802. He chaired the legislative section of the Council of State, in 1802, and participated in the drafting of the French Civil Code, the Criminal Code and the Code of commerce in close collaboration with Tronchet and Portalis. He also served as a senator. He collected such honours as being named Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor 14 June 1804, and comte de l'Empire 24 April 1808. On 30 March 1809 he is named to the Council of State, a position he held until his death. As officer of the Empire, he is buried at the Panth√©on 5 December 1810. Under the Directory, he entered the Council of Five Hundred, of which he was president during the month of Niv√¥se, Year IV, and was a member of the Court of Cassation, as well plenipotentiary at the Second Congress of Rastatt (December 1797).

In the 1950s, he attempted several times to enroll at the all-white Mississippi Southern College (now the University of Southern Mississippi) to complete his undergraduate degree started at the University of Chicago. Although the United States Supreme Court had ruled in 1954 that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, USM rejected him. Kennard was among the thousands of local activists in the 1940s and 1950s who pressed for their rights. After Kennard published a letter in the local paper about integrated education, the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a state- supported agency, conspired to have him arrested on false charges. He was convicted and sentenced to seven years at Parchman Penitentiary, the state's notorious high-security prison. He became terminally ill with cancer. The state governor refused to pardon him, but released him on parole in January 1963. Kennard died that year in July. After publication in 2005 of evidence that Kennard had been framed, supporters tried to secure a posthumous pardon for him, but Governor Haley Barbour refused. Supporters gained Barbour's cooperation in petitioning the court to review Kennard's case, and in 2006, his conviction was overturned completely. Early life and education Kennard was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in 1927. When he was 12, he went to Chicago and lived with his older sister Sara, in order to go full-time to public school. He graduated from Wendell Phillips High School. He enlisted in the US Army, serving for seven years: first in Germany after World War II, then during the Korean War serving as a paratrooper.Robert Shetterly, \\"Clyde Kennard\\", Americans Who Tell the Truth website, 2006-2015 Kennard returned to Chicago after his service, starting college at the University of Chicago. In 1955, after completing his junior year, Kennard returned to Hattiesburg to help his mother after his stepfather died. He had purchased land for her in nearby Eatonville, where he started a chicken farm. He taught Sunday school at the Mary Magdalene Baptist Church he attended in Eatonville.Kemp, Ed (July 4, 2013). \\"Civil rights trailblazer Clyde Kennard remembered\\", The Clarion-Ledger (Jackson, MS), 5 July 2013. Fight for education Given his need to stay in Hattiesburg, Kennard sought to enroll at Mississippi Southern College, a state institution, in 1956, 1957 and 1959. It was still segregated despite the ruling by the US Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Mississippi governor James P. Coleman offered to have the state pay Kennard's tuition elsewhere at a private college, but Kennard declined. He preferred that college as it was the closest to his home, a major factor given his family situation. On December 6, 1958, Kennard published a letter in the Hattiesburg American newspaper. He wrote that he was a \\"segregationist by nature\\" but \\"integrationist by choice.\\" He gave a reasoned explanation as to why segregation in education was impractical and bound to be replaced by an integrated system. Zack Van Landingham of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, which ostensibly encouraged the state's public image but worked to suppress activists for civil rights, urged J. H. White, the African-American president of Mississippi Vocational College, to persuade Kennard to end his quest at Mississippi Southern College. When Kennard could not be dissuaded, Van Landingham and Dudley Connor, a Hattiesburg lawyer. collaborated to suppress his activism. Files from the Sovereignty Commission, which the state opened for public review in 1998, showed that its officials went to the extreme of considering forcing Kennard into an accident or bombing his car to stop his quest.About.com: \\"Montana Governor pardons 70, Mississippi Governor pardons none\\" . Retrieved March 16, 2007. Instead, they framed him for a criminal offense. Framing, conviction and imprisonment The Sovereignty Commission conspired to have Kennard framed for a crime. On September 15, 1959, he was arrested in Hattiesburg by constables Charlie Ward and Lee Daniels for reckless driving. After he was jailed, Ward and Daniels claimed before Justice of the Peace T. C. Hobby to have found five half-pints of whiskey, along with other liquor,230561111584 Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDAH). under the seat of his car. Mississippi was a \\"dry\\" state, and possession of liquor was illegal until 1966. Kennard was convicted and fined $600. He soon became the victim of an unofficial local economic boycott (also a tactic of the Sovereignty Commission and White Citizens Councils), which cut off his credit. Kennard was arrested again on September 25, 1960, with an alleged accomplice for the theft of $25 worth of chicken feed from the Forrest County Cooperative warehouse. Kennard was prosecuted and his illiterate \\"accomplice,\\" Johnny Lee Roberts, testified against him.Clyde Kennard Exoneration site , Barry Bradford, Retrieved March 16, 2007. On November 21, 1960, an all-white jury deliberated 10 minutes and found Kennard guilty. (At this time, because of having been disenfranchised under the 1890 constitution and unable to vote in Mississippi, blacks were also excluded from juries.) Kennard was sentenced to seven years in prison, to be served in Parchman Penitentiary, the state's high-security facility. This sentence prevented his ever applying again to any of Mississippi's all-white colleges.Timothy J. Minchin and John A.

In 2005, when an investigation was re-opened into the case, Roberts testified under oath that Kennard was innocent: \\"Kennard did not ask me to steal, Kennard did not ask me to break into the co-op, Kennard did not ask me to do anything illegal.\\"\\"Clyde Kennard Framed and Jailed in MS\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans Just after the conclusion of the trial, Medgar Evers, president of the Mississippi chapter of the NAACP, was cited by the court for contempt after he issued a statement that Kennard's conviction was \\"a mockery of judicial justice.\\" Evers was fined $100 and sentenced to 30 days in jail, but on June 12, 1961, the Mississippi Supreme Court overturned his conviction. Cancer and death While imprisoned in 1961, Kennard was diagnosed with colon cancer and taken to the University of Mississippi hospital for surgery. The medical staff recommended that he be put in their custody or that they be allowed to make regular visits to check on his condition. Authorities sent him back to Parchman Prison, where he worked as a laborer. Learning of his illness, civil rights leaders in Hattiesburg embarked on a campaign to secure Kennard's release. After the story gained national attention in 1963, as the Civil Rights Movement was growing across the Deep South, Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett gave Kennard an \\"indefinite suspended sentence\\" or parole. Kennard was released on January 30, 1963. Comedian Dick Gregory paid for his flight to Chicago for medical treatment. Kennard twice underwent surgery at Billings Hospital on the University of Chicago campus over the next five months, but he died of cancer ten days after the second procedure. On July 7, a funeral service for Kennard was held at Metropolitan Funeral Parlor in Chicago. A poem he wrote on April 16, 1962, was read to the congregation.

(Bradford had worked with other high school students to collect information that led to the successful 2002 prosecution of murderers of the three civil rights workers in 1964.) Against the advice of leading Mississippi politicians, academics, and media, Barbour declined to give the pardon, concerned that it was for a deceased person. His spokesman said that Barbour had never pardoned anyone and would not do so for Kennard. He did acknowledge that Kennard was \\"entitled to have his rights restored.\\" Barbour designated March 30 as Clyde Kennard Day in the state, to attract attention and to commemorate Kennard's \\"determination, the injustices he suffered, and his significant role in the history of the civil rights movement in Mississippi\\". Students from the University of Southern Mississippi had previously joined the campaign to clear Kennard's name and collected more than 1,500 signatures in support of the pardon. They noted that in 2006, USM had more than 2,000 black students. Despite pleas from four former Mississippi governors, on May 10, 2006, the Mississippi State Parole Board refused to recommend a pardon. The Board's vote was split according to racial lines, with all of the white members voting to oppose a pardon recommendation. Every major newspaper in Mississippi denounced the decisions of the Governor and the Board. Kennard's brother-in-law, Rev. Willie Grant, expressed disappointment over the Board's decision. He said the state appeared to be trying to avoid any potential litigation damages over wrongful imprisonment. The Kennard family had already said publicly that they had no interest in seeking damages. Resolution Bradford and the students from Illinois shifted their efforts to using the courts to secure a reversal of the conviction. They contacted Charles Pickering, a former Federal judge, and William Winter, a former Mississippi governor, who fashioned precedent-setting legal strategy. Using research by Bradford and the students, and the exhaustive legal research prepared by Drizin and Bobby Owens, a Northwestern University law student from Mississippi, Pickering and Winter finally succeeded in clearing Kennard's name. Judge Bob Helfrich accepted a petition from \\"Barbour, several former judges, a university president and others\\" to rehear the case. After arguments by Pickering and Winter, heading a blue-ribbon legal team, on May 17, 2006, Helfrich threw out Kennard's original burglary conviction, stating, \\"To me, this is not a black and white issue; it's a right and wrong issue. To correct that wrong, I am compelled to do the right thing.\\" Barbour said that Helfrich's decision was the \\"appropriate, constitutional way for this innocent man to be exonerated.\\" Six days after Helfrich's decree, white supremacist Richard Barrett filed documents to overturn the decision. Barrett was a vocal supporter of Edgar Ray Killen, convicted in federal court in June 2005 of manslaughter in the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in 1964. Barrett's motion was summarily dismissed by Judge Helfrich. His appeal to the Mississippi State Supreme Court was likewise dismissed, ending the legal saga.

Its subject is contemporary urban Australia and the artists who are making it a host for illegal street art. With the tagline 'Scratch it and it spreads', Rash explores the cultural value of unsanctioned public art and the ways that street art and graffiti contribute to public dialogue. Directed by Nicholas Hansen and Mutiny Media, Rash was three years in the making and includes interviews with many of Melbourne‚Äôs inspired street art and graffiti artists as well as visitors who came to Melbourne and leave their mark. Rash is the first feature-length documentary in Australia to focus on the new art form of street art. Filming began in 2002 on this documentary, which conveys the commitment, ideals and beliefs demonstrated in Melbourne street art. Artists use a variety of approaches including bill posters, stencils, and performance art put the artwork right in the public eye. The film was made in the lead up to the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. Before the games local councils were juggling the need to present a clean and safe city for visitors against the enthusiastic activities of street and graffiti artists. A similar response was later observed in the lead up to the London 2012 Summer Olympics.Cleaning up London July 2012 Guardian and The London Vandal articles.

The forest has a total area of 871,495 acres (1,361.71 sq mi or 3,526.82 km2). Its headquarters is in Nevada City, California.

Tahoe was originally established as the Lake Tahoe Forest Reserve on April 13, 1899. The name was changed to Tahoe on October 3, 1905. President Theodore Roosevelt supported the transfer of forest reserves from the U.S. Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service in 1905, with Gifford Pinchot as Chief Forester. Thus began the United States National Forest System. In 1908, the Sierra National Forest was divided into five units and as time went on, more divisions, additions, and combinations were worked out so that presently, Tahoe is one of eight national forests along the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. They are, from north to south, Plumas, Tahoe, Eldorado, Toiyabe, Stanislaus, Inyo, Sierra, and Sequoia. The charter given by James Wilson, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, states: The National Forests are for the purpose of preserving a perpetual supply of timber for home industries, preventing a destruction of forest cover which regulates the flow of streams, and protecting local residents from unfair competition in the use of forest and range.

He is best known for his portrait work and decorative mosaics in St Paul's Cathedral in London. Richmond was influential in the early stages of the Arts and Crafts Movement in his selection of bold colours and materials for the mosaics in St. Paul's Cathedral and in his collaboration with James Powell and Sons, glass makers, in creating new colours and materials. This new material expanded the glassmaker's palette and was favored by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, primarily in the creation of stained glass windows and decorative art work. Richmond was the Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford from 1878 to 1883, succeeding his friend and mentor John Ruskin. Early life and education William Blake Richmond was born on 29 November 1842 in Marylebone. His father, George Richmond , was an important portrait painter; his mother was Julia Tatham (1811‚Äì1881). He was named after a close friend of his father, the poet William Blake. Richmond was tutored at home due to health problems as a child. In 1858, at the age of 14, Richmond enrolled at the Royal Academy of Art where he studied drawing and painting for three years. He also spent time at John Ruskin's house, where he was given private art lessons by the prominent artist. In 1859, Richmond painted his first picture, Enid and Geraint. He sold the painting for ¬£20, spending the money to tour Italy for six weeks with a tutor. His time spent viewing the Old Master paintings in Italy had a major impact on Richmond's development as an artist and later career. His favorite Italian painters were Michelangelo, Tintoretto and Giotto. Artistic career =Painting= Self-portrait 1863 Richmond became a successful portrait painter at an early age. In 1861, at the age of 19, he exhibited his first major work for the Royal Academy of Arts. The painting, a portrait of his two brothers, was highly praised by Ruskin. That year, Richmond continued to work in portraits, and study anatomy at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Richmond's widely regarded portraits led to several commissions, a few of which took him to the north of England for several months. Robert Louis Stevenson portrait 1886 Richmond was elected to the Royal Academy in 1861, where he continued to exhibit his work until 1877. In 1865, Richmond returned to Italy, where he lived in Rome for four years and studied art. While in Italy, he met the painters Frederic Leighton and Giovanni Costa, both of whose work he admired. When Richmond returned to England, he exhibited A Procession in Honour of Bacchus at the Royal Academy in 1869. In 1877, Richmond left the Royal Academy and began exhibiting his paintings with the Grosvenor Gallery, where he exhibited until 1878. In 1878 Richmond became Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford University, succeeding Ruskin. During his tenure, Richmond was responsible for 12 lectures a year at the school. A few lectures Richmond gave on his favourite artist Michelangelo led to a serious conflict with Ruskin, who had little regard for that artist. The disagreement between the two men led Richmond to resign his position five years after taking it up, although he and Ruskin were able to continue their long-standing friendship. Richmond travelled often to Italy, Greece, Spain and Egypt in the 1880s. He would spend a few months each year exploring new areas, absorbing the history and mythology of the region, and making numerous drawings and coloured sketches. In 1888, Richmond resumed his relationship with the Royal Academy when he was elected an Associate Member (ARA), and was then further elected a Royal Academician (RA) in 1895. He served as Professor of Painting at the Academy from 1895 to 1899 and from 1909 to 1911, and continued to exhibit with the Academy until 1916. He was elected Senior RA at the Academy in 1920. =Mosaic design= Richmond's mosaic panels in the interior of St. Paul's Cathedral Attaining financial success as a portrait painter led Richmond to explore new areas of interest. He began working on large, allegorical paintings, and developed an interest in the design of stained glass and mosaic. In 1882, Richmond gave a lecture on monumental decoration in which he criticized the bland decorations in many British churches. He viewed the churches as \\"caves of white-washed sepulchres, uncoloured, or if coloured at all, only in parts, patchily, and with little general idea of design.\\" Nine years later, in 1891, Richmond put his theory into practice when he started work on the quire and apse of St. Paul's Cathedral. Richmond worked on the interior decorations, as both designer and craftsman involved in the installation of the mosaics, from 1891 to 1904. Influenced by the vibrant colours of Byzantine and early Christian work in Italy, Greece and Egypt, Richmond designed bold, colourful mosaics for the Cathedral choir and apse; over seventy allegorical mosaic panels were installed, along with spandrels and ornamental mosaic ceiling decoration. Richmond's work was a complete renewal of the quire, the decorations painted directly onto the existing architectural ornaments and stained-glass windows. \\"Richmond chose to abandon the flat surface of mosaicists like Salviati, in favour of a more vibrant treatment, based on the use of jagged, irregular glass, set at angles to the plaster, so that it would catch the light. The new installation was a complete renewal of the quire, the decorations painted directly onto the existing architectural decorations and stained glass windows.\\" When completed, the newly remodeled choir and apse, met with public controversy. Several people criticized the mosaics as not being traditionally British and did not belong in a Cathedral. There was a continual debate throughout the 1890s, \\"partly reflecting a High-Low church debate between ornament and plainness.\\" =Stained glass design= Youth, Holy Trinity Church, London Charity, Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Square, London Richmond collaborated with Harry James Powell of James Powell and Sons, glassmakers, in developing new colours for the mosaic glass to be installed in St. Paul's Cathedral. The new colours and combinations of those colours began to be offered in the standard Powell glass palette from the early 1890s. The expanded glass selection inspired artists in the early stages of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The new, heavier glass, often with light streaks of colour was used by artists in newly commissioned stained glass windows and decorative work. The influence of the mosaic work done at the Cathedral and the invention of new medieval-like colours by Powell, influenced Richmond in the stained glass windows that he designed for St. Mary's church in Stretton, Staffordshire. Richmond's five-light east chancel window at Stretton, completed in 1896, was a successful translation of his previous work into stained glass. His mosaic influenced work at Stretton is displayed in the surface of the glass, roughly painted to resemble the effects of mosaic. The three-light north and south chancel windows that he designed for St. Mary's (1898), were similar in theme to his earlier mosaic work with his choice of heavy leading in the windows and glass that gave off a sparkling appearance. The raw materials he selected for the windows included thick slabs of glass, streaked with light veins of colour. This glass that may have been used in his work at the Cathedral. Richmond designed three large windows (1904‚Äî1910) in the Lady Chapel of Holy Trinity Sloane Street, London. Bronze Runner, Hammersmith =Sculpture= Richmond created a number of highly acclaimed sculptures, including a piece titled An Athlete exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1879, a bronze sculpture of a Greek runner donated to his village of Hammersmith, and an Arts and Crafts style monument of William Gladstone in St. Denoi's church, in Hawarden, Flintshire. Environmental activism Richmond was an early advocate for clean air in London. He founded the Coal Smoke Abatement Society (CSAS) in 1898 and was a member of CSAS for a number of years. He decided to form the organization after becoming increasingly frustrated with the low light levels in winter caused by coal smoke. Richmond penned a letter to the London Times in 1898 with a request for action, stating that \\"the darkness was comparable to a total eclipse of the sun\\". Richmond wrote magazine articles and gave public lectures on the danger of coal smoke. CSAS would go on to become the oldest environmental Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) in the United Kingdom and later become Environmental Protection UK.

It is named after pioneer Peter Lassen, who mined, ranched and promoted the area to emigrant parties in the 1850s. Wildlife Animals that are typically found in this forest are black bear, raccoon, coyote, bobcat, fox, mule deer, skunk, marten, cougar, brown creeper, a variety of chipmunk species, mountain chickadee, a variety of squirrel species, white-headed woodpecker, weasel, a variety of mouse species, long-toed salamander, and a wide variety of bat species. In 2017, three wolf pups were born in this forest. Their mother is a female wolf of unknown origins. Their father is the son of OR7, a wolf with a tracking device that was the first of its kind in almost a century to migrate into California from Oregon. As of July 2020, the pack has 14 members, with 8 new pups. The father of the pups is not related to any of the other California wolves and joined the pack in 2019. Overview Lassen National Forest is located about east of Red Bluff, California. It is generally bounded by Sierra Nevada mountain range to the south, the Modoc Plateau to the east and California's Central Valley to the west. The forest is in parts of Lassen, Shasta, Tehama, Plumas, and Butte counties. Forest headquarters is located in Susanville, California. There are local ranger district offices in Chester, Fall River Mills, and Susanville. The forest was formed in 1905 when it was named one of the National Forest Reserves, which evolved into the National Forest system.U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 33, Part 1, Chap. 288, p. 628. \\"An Act Providing for the transfer of forest reserves from the Department of Interior to the Department of Agriculture.\\" H.R. 8460, Public Resolution No. 34. The forest was first named the Lassen Peak Forest Reserve because of Lassen Peak, a volcano which is in the southernmost portion of the Cascade Range volcanoes. Mt. Lassen erupted with explosive force in 1915. The forest surrounds Lassen Volcanic National Park. The forest has two major river systems as well as many lakes, cinder cones and lava flows. Surveys estimate the forest contains of old growth. Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests (Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa), and White Fir (Abies concolor)), Jeffrey Pine (Pinus jeffreyi) forests, Red Fir (Abies magnifica) forests, and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta) forests are the most common types. It is a major source of lumber products. =Wilderness areas= There are three officially designated wilderness areas within Lassen National Forest that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. A small portion of one extends onto land that is managed by the Bureau of Land Management (as indicated). * Caribou Wilderness * Ishi Wilderness (partly BLM) * Thousand Lakes Wilderness Cultural significance Lassen National Forest is also the site of significant events in California history: Ishi Wilderness was the refuge of the \\"last wild Indian\\", Caribou Wilderness was one of the first protected \\"primitive areas\\" decades before the federal wilderness system was established, and the volcanic explosion of Mt. Lassen was the first eruption to be witnessed and photographed in the history of the continental United States. On Labor Day 1911, a Native American was discovered outside the slaughterhouse in Oroville, California. Ishi, as he came to be known, became a celebrity. He lived his remaining years at the University of California's Anthropology Museum on Parnassus Heights in San Francisco, under the sponsorship of anthropologist Alfred Kroeber. The university had no protocol for keeping a living museum exhibit, so Kroeber arranged for Ishi's employment as assistant janitor. Ishi was Yahi, the southernmost division of the Yana and had spent the majority of his life in hiding in the rugged Deer Creek territory north of Oroville. After his discovery, he would not disclose his name. Ishi, the name given by Kroeber, was the Yahi word for man. Kroeber believed that cultural etiquette prevented Ishi from disclosing his name. In 1908, a utility company crew surprised the small band of survivors in their camp. Ishi and the three others fled. When Ishi was discovered outside the slaughterhouse, he was alone, his hair burned short in mourning. Ishi died in Berkeley in 1916 of tuberculosis. In 1984 Congress established the An additional of the Ishi wilderness is managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management for a total of . Ishi Wilderness in the dry, rugged, volcanic terrain, where the last band of Southern Yanas had sought refuge. (Visitors to this wilderness are advised by the United States Forest Service to visit only during cooler months because of a lack of water during the summer.) A year before Ishi's death, Mt. Lassen exploded. Mt. Lassen is officially recognized as Lassen Peak by the United States Board on Geographic Names. Before the eruption on May 22, 1915, the smoking volcano became a tourist draw. Today, within Lassen Volcanic National Park, the area surrounding the volcano is known as the Devastated Area. An ancient volcano, known as Mount Tehama is believed to have been much larger than Lassen Peak. Its explosion is responsible for the topography of the national forest and the national park: a volcanic rim, with elevations beginning at above sea level. A rock mesa in Lassen National Forest, Caribou Wilderness, California The third historical resource is the Caribou Wilderness immediately east of the National Park. Caribou Wilderness received protection as a Primitive Area beginning in 1932.Gerard, David The Origins of the Federal Wilderness System, Ch.6 In the 1920s, the managers of the Forest Service engaged in both an internal and external struggle regarding the agency's mission. Aldo Leopold and Bob Marshall, Forest Service employees, each advocated setting aside some forest areas as wilderness off-limits to mining, logging, road construction and grazing. The first primitive area was created in 1924 in New Mexico and is now named the Aldo Leopold Wilderness. But creation of primitive areas did not become a forest agency policy until 1929. Externally, the National Park Service, sought to expand parks from existing public lands, primarily national forest lands. The Forest Service responded by creating primitive areas. Initially these new wilderness areas received no special protections other than the official designation. Caribou Primitive area became a likely candidate for primitive status as it shares the length of its western border with the national park. Caribou Primitive Area received greater protection in 1939, when Interior Secretary Harold Ickes sought to convince President Franklin D. Roosevelt to combine the Forest Service and the National Park Service into a new agency under the management of the United States Department of Interior. Roosevelt declined to act, but the threat of moving the Forest Service out of the United States Department of Agriculture resulted in greater protections for national forest wilderness areas. A congressional bill had earlier given the President authority to act on this new Department of Conservation. In 1964, Caribou was among the first group of federally protected wildernesses created by the first Wilderness Act. The Lassen forest also contains the Thousand Lakes Wilderness,Adkinson, Ron Wild Northern California The Globe Piquet Press, 2001 p. 204 also created in 1964. Recreation Deer Creek Falls, just off of Highway 32 Lassen National Forest, encompassing a large area, has many recreational opportunities with two large lakes nearby, a National Park, and many campgrounds and hiking trails. The forest is easily accessible from San Francisco, Sacramento and Redding. The Pacific Crest Trail passes through the Forest and Park.

Built on what was once the roadbed of Southern Pacific's Fernley and Lassen Branch Railway, it has been converted to a riding and hiking trail. There are 12 river crossings and two tunnels along the trail with the Susan River segment being the most scenic with views of the canyon, river and mountains. Some camping is allowed on portions of the trail but some areas have camping restrictions. The railroad operated from 1914 to 1956 and was officially abandoned by Southern Pacific Railroad in 1978. The trail has four distinct seasons because of the elevation changes. The trail begins at on the east side of the Sierra and Cascade Ranges in Susanville, rises to a high point of at Westwood Junction then descends to the trails' end in the town of Westwood at elevation. The Subway Cave is a lava tube located 1/2 mile north of Old Station, with developed stairs leading into the cave and guided tours offered seasonally on weekends. Parking and picnic areas are available.Subway Cave, Lassen National Forest Spencer Meadows National Recreation Trail is a six-mile (10 km) path through aspen groves, meadow areas, incense cedar, and bubbling springs. Beginning at the junction of state routes 36 and 89, it goes through the forest and the Park, then connects with other trails inside the Park. Heart Lake National Recreation Trail is more than three miles (5 km) in length and follows Martin Creek with views of Lassen Peak and Brokeoff Mountain within the national park. An historic emigrant trail established in 1852 is the Nobles Emigrant Trail. A prospecting party led by William Nobles crossed from Indian Valley to Honey Lake Valley. Nobles was later hired to shift the stream of emigrants to the town of Shasta in hopes of increasing settlers' traffic into the town. The trail goes through Susanville and past the north side of Lassen Volcanic National Park. The Hat Creek Recreational Area of the forest has seven campgrounds scattered along the creek as well as large lava flows, lava tubes, hiking trails and views of Mount Lassen. Highway 89 follows Hat Creek through much of the forest.US Forest Service map, Lassen National Forest 1990. Lake Almanor is just south of the forest with Forest Service land and campgrounds on the west shore. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;) operate the lake which was acquired from Great Western Power Company in 1930 when they merged with P.G. and E. The North Fork of the Feather River is the primary source for Lake Almanor, as well as a number of freshwater springs and smaller rivers. The name of the lake is derived from the Great Western Power Company's vice president, Guy C. Earl, who combined the names of his three daughters, Alice, Martha and Elanor.Website of Project 2105 Committee, a citizens group involved in FERC relicensing of hydroelectric power at Lake Almanor . The Forest Service maintains 63 developed recreational sites and an indeterminate number of primitive campgrounds. History Old growth red fir tree in Lassen National Forest, California. =Peter Lassen= Peter Lassen will be long remembered with having a hospital, college, street, mountain, creek, national park, county, and national forest each carrying his name. He was ambitious, his timing was perfect, and, like his contemporary pioneer, Johann Augustus Sutter, everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Lassen was murdered by an unknown person in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada Territory, two months after being profiled by Hutching's California Magazine. The profile is contained in the February, 1859 edition of Hutching's. Lassen was murdered April 29, 1859. The murderer was never found, but the list of suspects is long: Disgruntled clients of the Lassen Trail or various business associates were among those suspected. The conclusion of the magazine profile includes this quote from Lassen: \\"Beware of bad partners, and nine-tenths of the lawyers, and if need be, add the other tenth, and thus eschew law and lawyers altogether.\\" Apparently his killer heeded the advice. Lassen, Edward Clapper and Americus Wyatt, were on a silver mining expedition, camped in the Black Rock Desert north of Virginia City, Nevada Territory. This was the beginning of the Comstock silver excitement in northern Nevada. Clapper and Lassen were shot and killed as the trio was breaking camp. Wyatt survived and was the only witness. Officially a band of Paiute Native Americans received blame but few pioneers believed the story. Lassen's body was recovered and buried near his cabin at Honey Lake Valley. Clapper's remains remained in what is now known as Clapper Canyon. A partial skeleton was discovered there by hikers in 1991, and Clapper's remains have since been interred near Lassen's grave. Susanville, the seat of Lassen County is in the Honey Lake Valley. Lassen was born on October 31, 1800 in Farum, Denmark and emigrated to Mexican California around 1840 from the Oregon Territory. Like Sutter, he acquired Mexican citizenship (1844) and applied for a land grant (1843) National Park Service Official website-Historynotes of 5 square leaguesA square league is -Lolle, Andrew California, A History 2nd ed. p.114 on the south bank of Deer Creek in what is now Butte County, California. This grant provided access to the Sacramento River, an important issue during the pioneer period for transportation of goods and people. Lassen lost his estate around 1851 by mortgaging the land to further his business interests. He then migrated to the Honey Lake Valley where he attempted mining, and which is in modern-day Lassen County. Lassen County was established on April 1, 1864, five years after his death.Rolle, Andrew F. California, A History AHM Publishing Corp., 1969 =Lassen Peak Reserve= The beginnings of Lassen National Forest began in 1891 with congressional passage of what has become known as the Forest Reserve Act. This bill was actually entitled: \\"An Act To Repeal Timber Culture Laws And For Other Purposes.\\". The first federal forest reserves were created soon after President William Henry Harrison signed the repeal into law. Section 24 of the act authorized the President of the United States to set aside public lands as forest reserves without further permission from Congress. In addition to Harrison, President William McKinley set aside forest lands, as did President Theodore Roosevelt, until Congress put a stop to the practice in 1907, by banning additional set asides in six western states.Documentary Chronology of Selected Events in the Development of the American Conservation Movement. California was not among those six states but was later added to the ban. Lassen Peak Reserve was not created until 1905, less than a month before Congress approved the Transfer Act, which took the reserves away from the General Land Office and the Department of Interior. Instead, the newly created U.S. Forest Service managed the lands under the Department of Agriculture. The reserves then became the National Forests. In 1908 Lassen absorbed portions of Diamond Mountain National Forest and exchanged lands with Plumas National Forest and Shasta National Forest. Lassen National Park was carved from the Lassen National Forest in 1916,U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 39, Part 1, Chap. 302, pp. 442-44. \\"An Act To establish the Lassen Volcanic National Park in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the State of California, and for other purposes.\\" H.R. 348, Public Act No. 184 when Congress approved the creation of the National Park Service, administered by the Interior department. Lassen Peak already enjoyed protection as a National Monument, set aside by Roosevelt in 1907. The uneasy relationship between the US Forest Service and the National Park Service continued for several decades, perhaps culminating in 1931 when Congress forbade Lassen National Park from expanding its boundaries. Earlier, in 1906, Gifford Pinchot, Chief Forester in the Department of Agriculture, sought to move the national parks into the forest service. Pinchot was thwarted by Congressman John F. Lacey, an ardent preservationist. Pinchot's goal was to subject the Parks to logging and other aspects of his scientific management philosophy. Later, in 1939, Interior Secretary Harold Ickes proposed the opposite-of combining the national parks and forests into an agency that would take a preservationist approach.Gerard, David The Origins of the Federal Wilderness System p.4, Ch.6 See also * Geology of the Lassen volcanic area * Transfer Act of 1905 References * http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/cnchron4.html Library of Congress American Memory - Documentary Chronology of Selected Events in the Development of the American Conservation Movement, 1847‚Äì1920 * Lassen National Forest official website * Webpage on history of Peter Lassen's grave.

Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts a sports talk format carrying a mixture of local and ESPN Radio programming. Its studios are in Miami Gardens and the transmitter is in Virginia Key, Florida. History WQAM is one of Florida's oldest radio stations, first signing on the air in February 1921. 1921 in radio WQAM was launched in Miami, Florida by the W.W. Luce of the Electrical Equipment Company, WQAM received the first broadcasting license in Miami being the first broadcast radio station in the State of Florida. In January 1923. The station's early history was related to WFAW, also of Miami, which was licensed to The Miami Daily Metropolis from June 16, 1922, to June 11, 1923.Radio Service Bulletin, July 1, 1922, \\"New Stations: Broadcasting Stations\\", page 3. In the beginning, the young station was helped with programming by the newspaper, until the paper ended its participation.Hollingsworth 1949. p. 56 Things were primitive in the early days. Fred W. Barton, president of the Miami Broadcasting Company made many of the electrical parts himself. In 1926, the station increased its power to 500 watts. The station was the first in the United States to install a permanent remote pick-up from the U. S. Meteorological Department. Power was increased to 1,000 watts in 1928, and WQAM became a full-time affiliate of CBS. In 1947, it switched to ABC Radio. In 1948, Barton sold his interest in the station and The Miami Herald assumed entire ownership. WQAM is famous for its days in the 1960s, under the ownership of Storz Broadcasting, when it presented a Top 40 format and competed vigorously with rival WFUN (at 790 AM). In February 1964, the station interviewed and heavily promoted The Beatles' second and third nationally televised appearances on CBS's The Ed Sullivan Show live from the Deauville Hotel in North Beach, Miami Beach. By far Miami and South Florida's preeminent radio station at the time, baby boomers from Jupiter to Key West, and down to Havana, listened to WQAM for the latest in local and American pop music from the 1960s well into the late 1970s. At that time, WQAM was one of the many AM radio stations airing Casey Kasem's American Top 40, and Cuban youngsters used to gather at friend's houses to listen to the countdown of America's most popular songs, especially the 8-hour-long year-end show of Billboard's top 100 songs of the year in which the syndication company that owned the show had put out on vinyl records at a speed of 33 RPM. On February 29, 1985, Sunshine Wireless bought AM 560 WQAM.[6] WQAM had been a long-time Top 40 station. After many years as a contemporary music station and heavy competition from FM competitors forced the station to switch to a country music format, but not after running a montage of music and soundbites from its Top 40 days. Sunshine Wireless now had an AM country station, with personality DJs, NBC News, and local information. From that time, WQAM was known as \\"56 Country WQAM\\", and was successful in the ratings Under the direction of program director Jon Holiday. WQAM had many veteran DJ's for the country format like Mike Bell, Mitch Lewis, Johnny Dolan, Boomer, and George Sheldon- who had his start in radio @QAM in 1986, WQAM shared studios with then-WKQS at 9881 Sheridan Street in Cooper City. In 1986 WQAM would add sports talk programming in the evening hours with Ed Kaplan. By 1989, the station had been unable to achieve a full share point in the Arbitron surveys with its mix of country music and sports. In 1990, WQAM had abandoned its country music format in favor of the satellite-fed \\"Kool Gold\\" service, which aired '50s and '60s music. Around 1992, WQAM became an all-sports station. Currently, WQAM is the flagship station for the Miami Dolphins, Florida Panthers, and University of Miami Hurricanes. WQAM used to be a Yahoo! Sports Radio affiliate. On January 2, 2013, the station switched to CBS Sports Radio for after-hours programming.http://staatalent.com/2013/headlines/wqam-joins-cbs-radio/ On October 2, 2014, Beasley Broadcast Group announced that it would trade 5 radio stations located in Miami (including WQAM) and Philadelphia to CBS Radio in exchange for 14 stations located in Tampa, Charlotte and Philadelphia.CBS And Beasley Swap Philadelphia/Miami For Charlotte/Tampa from Radio Insight (October 2, 2014) The swap was completed on December 1, 2014. On December 23, 2015, WQAM was granted a Federal Communications Commission construction permit to move to the WOCN transmitter site and decrease day power to 4,100 watts. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th, making WQAM a sister station to fellow sports station WAXY. On August 2, 2019, Entercom announced that WQAM would re-launch as 560 The Joe on August 5, 2019, as part of a re-alignment of its sports talk lineups. WAXY's ESPN Radio affiliation was swapped to WQAM, clearing The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz (as its new flagship station), Stephen A. Smith, and the network's overnight and weekend programming (notwithstanding conflicts with sports play-by-play). In turn, some of WQAM's local hosts were moved to WAXY's lineup, while Marc Hochman and Channing Crowder's afternoon program would be simulcast by both stations (but with an opening hour exclusive to WAXY). Beginning August 17, Hochman and Crowder will be simulcast in full by WQAM as part of a larger realignment of ESPN Radio's schedule occurring that day (which sees Dan Le Batard cut to two hours, and the addition of a new Mike Greenberg-hosted program).

He has been called \\"the single most powerful American Anglo-Saxonist of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\\" Life Cook was born in Montville, New Jersey. He began working as a mathematics tutor at sixteen and was offered chemistry professorship in Fukui, Japan before entering college, which he declined. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Rutgers College in 1872, writing a thesis on \\"The Inclined Planes of the Morris Canal,\\" and taught there and at Freehold Academy while completing a Master of Science degree. Having already learned German, he went on to study in G√∂ttingen and Leipzig from 1877 to 1878, where he began learning languages including Latin, Greek, Italian, and Old English. He returned to the United States for two years as an associate in English at Johns Hopkins University, then in 1881 he spent time in London with phoneticist Henry Sweet studying manuscripts of Cynewulf and the Old Northumbrian Gospels at the British Museum. This work allowed him to complete a PhD in 1882 at the University of Jena, where he studied under Eduard Sievers. Cook became a professor of English in the University of California in 1882, where he re-organized the teaching of English in the state of California, introduced English requirements for university admission, and edited many texts for reading in secondary schools. He became chair of English language and literature at Yale University in 1889, where he remained for thirty-two years until his death and became a prolific editor of major English works and literary criticism. Cook's best-known scholarly work is in Old English and in poetics, fields in which he produced over three hundred publications. He translated, edited, and revised Sievers' Old English Grammar (1885), edited Judith (1888), The Christ of Cynewulf (1900), Asser's Life of King Alfred (1905), and The Dream of the Rood (1905), and prepared A First Book in Old English Grammar (1894).

He was the youngest son of Jules Antoine Rousseau (sculpteur du Roi). The territorial addition to his patronymic (\\"de la Rottiere\\") has never been explained, but it is known to have been in use when he was little more than a boy. Life and work Jean Simeon studied at the Academie Royale, where in September 1768 he won the medal given to the best painter of the quarter. Together with his brother Jules Hugues, he was employed from an early date by his father for the decorative work executed by the family at the Palace of Versailles. There has been some controversy among the authorities as to the respective shares of father and son in these works, but many of the attributions are fairly determined by dates, Jules Antoine Rousseau having been at work at Versailles for years before the birth of his famous son. The Bains du Roi, the Salon de la M√©ridienne, part of the bedchamber of Madame Adelaide, and the Garde-robe of King Louis XVI of France were among the achievements which there can be little doubt were shared in by Rousseau de la Rotti√®re. His most individual and most famous undertaking was, however, the decoration of the Boudoir de Madame de S√©villy, now at the Victoria and Albert Museum. This little room, measuring 4 x 3 m and almost 5 m high, was removed from the house in the Rue de Saint Louis, in Le Marais. The Seigneur de S√©villy, who was hereditary Tr√©sorier G√©n√©ral de l'Extraordinaire des Guerres under Louis XVI, married his cousin Anne Marie Louise de Pange, a favorite maid-of-honor of Marie Antoinette, and the story runs that Mme de S√©villy and the queen, wanting to give him a surprise, had the room decorated during his absence from Paris. It was purchased for the museum for 60,000 francs in 1869. The wall paintings of this sumptuous room came from the hand of Rousseau de la Rotti√®re; the overdoor and part of the ceiling were executed by Lagrene le jeune; the architect was Ledoux; the grey marble figures of aged men on either side of the fireplace were sculptured by Clodion; the mounts of the chimneypiece are apparently from the chisel of Gouthire. The date of the room is assigned to 1781-82, and Rousseau's authorship of much of its decoration is rendered certain by a sketch of his which still survives. The decoration was inspired to themes taken from the excavations of Pompeii. The tall narrow panels are painted in medallions with amorini; festoons and bouquets of flowers fill every available space; the shutters are painted with doves and shepherdesses. Lagrene's pictures in the upper lunettes represent the elements; upon the ceiling is Jupiter enthroned within a deep blue border. It is a melancholy reflection that M. de S√©villy, whom his wife and Marie Antoinette combined to surprise with this chefdoeuvre, was guillotined, and that his wife, whose sitting-room it was, was condemned to die with him and with Madame √âlisabeth de France, whom they had befriended, but was saved, against her will, by the princess, who made a false declaration as to her condition. She had two subsequent husbands, and lost them both in little more than two years. She herself lived less than five years after her delivery by the fall of Robespierre.

Lisandro de la Torre (6 December 1868 - 5 January 1939) was an Argentine politician, born in Rosario, province of Santa Fe. De la Torre became a lawyer in 1890. His thesis about municipalities and communes, as well as other works of his, gave rise to the idea of municipal autonomy in Argentina, which was included in the Argentine Constitution in the 1994 reform. In 1898 he founded the newspaper La Rep√∫blica (\\"The Republic\\") in Rosario.  Beginnings in politics  A member of the Radical Civic Union (Uni√≥n C√≠vica Radical, UCR) under the leadership of Leandro Alem, de la Torre abandoned the party in 1897 due to disagreement with the new leader, Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen. Later, in 1908, he was part of the founding group of the Southern League (Liga del Sur), a local party. In 1911 he was elected for the provincial legislature representing the San Lorenzo Department; in 1912 he became a representative of Santa Fe (diputado) for the Southern League in the lower house of the National Congress. On 14 December 1914 de la Torre took part of the constitutive assembly of the Democratic Progressive Party (Partido Dem√≥crata Progresista, PDP) at the Hotel Savoy, Buenos Aires. The new party appointed him the presidential candidate for the 1916 elections, with Alejandro Carb√≥ as the vice-president. The PDP was defeated by the UCR's candidate (H. Yrigoyen). De la Torre also lost the 1919 elections where he had presented as a candidate for senator representing the city of Buenos Aires. De la Torre's PDP participated in the shaping of a new provincial constitution for Santa Fe, in 1921, which was considered modern and progressive for the time, but ended up being vetoed by the Radical governor Enrique Mosca. De la Torre was elected national representative for Santa Fe in 1922. In 1925, however, he announced his retirement from active politics. In 1928 the PDP was overwhelmingly defeated in the province, which moved the wannabe-governor Francisco Correa to exclaim, \\"We are too few to win, but too many to disappear\\". In 1931 the PDP entered the Democratic-Socialist Alliance, which appointed De la Torre and Nicol√°s Repetto for the presidential elections, but they were defeated by Agust√≠n Pedro Justo and Julio Argentino Roca, Jr..  Work in the National Senate  In 1932 the PDP met triumph again when Luciano Molinas became the governor of Santa Fe. At the same time, de la Torre became a national senator. In 1935 he initiated an investigation on the meat trade, which had been previously attempted without success by his fellow party member Julio Noble. In the midst of the investigation, de la Torre's disciple, senator-elect Enzo Bordabehere, was murdered by Ram√≥n Valdez Cora, and the province of Santa Fe was intervened. The bullet that killed Bordabehere, it is said, was destined for de la Torre. Valdez Cora was sentenced to 20 years of prison, of which he served 18. He was released in 1953, but died shortly after that, 18 months later. The murder was depicted by Juan Jos√© Jusid's 1984 film, Asesinato en el Senado de la Naci√≥n. The debate had been caused by some protectionist laws, destined to protect the prices of grains, beef, wine, etc. De la Torre and two ministers exchanged insults until eventually the senator was challenged to a duel. He accepted the challenge of Federico Pinedo, Minister of Finance, but refused the duel with the Minister of Agriculture, Luis Duhau, since he did not consider Duhau a gentleman. Pinedo shot to kill, but missed, and de la Torre missed deliberately, so neither was injured, but reconciliation never came. De la Torre was a member of the Senate until 1937.  De la Torre's death and legacy  A bust of Lisandro de la Torre on Rondeau Boulevard, Rosario. Overwhelmed by his economic problems, Lisandro de la Torre committed suicide on 5 January 1939, in Buenos Aires. His ashes are now in an urn, buried in the El Salvador Cemetery of Rosario. The Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum, also in Rosario, displays a reproduction of de la Torre's residence in 22 Esmeralda St. of Buenos Aires, with the original furniture. A meatpacking plant in Buenos Aires, famously the site of a major labor conflict in 1959, was named after him.Barricadas de carne en Mataderos at www.clarin.com Today, a barrio (neighbourhood) in the north-east of the city (Barrio Lisandro de la Torre, also known as Arroyito, the home of the Rosario Central football club) carries his name, as well as a one-block street in the southern region, and many streets and avenues throughout Argentina. A movie filmed in 1984, called Asesinato en el senado de la naci√≥n, dramatized the final days before the murder of Enzo Bordavere. De la Torre was portrayed by Pepe Soriano; the movie was directed by Juan Jos√© Jusid.

The village falls within the Hemsworth ward of Wakefield City Council. Governance It is part of the town of Hemsworth and local government is in the hands of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council, with the Hemsworth Town Council as a mainly consultative body. However, the Post Office recognises it as a separate settlement from the town of Hemsworth. History The Catchpenny pub It was built as a pit village. It has a railway station on the Wakefield Line, providing it with connections to Leeds, Wakefield, Doncaster and Sheffield. The railway station closed in 1967, reopened in 1982 and the line was electrified in 1989. The village provided housing for miners at the colliery originally named \\"Fitzwilliam Main\\".fitzwilliam archive The name was taken from the family name of the colliery's proprietor. In 1905, a bitter industrial dispute led to all the miners being expelled from their homes, which were owned by the Fitzwilliam family; this became known as the \\"Kinsley eviction\\". The mine later changed its name to Hemsworth Colliery which closed in 1969. Kinsley Drift Mine was opened on the site of the old Hemsworth Colliery in 1977. In the long-running Miners' Strike of 1984 to 1985, which most Nottinghamshire miners refused to join, a riot took place in Fitzwilliam on 9 July 1984, and nine people (\\"The Fitzwilliam Nine\\") were convicted of public order offences as a result.BBC reportFull might of union was mobilised, Wakefield Express The Miners' Strike 25th anniversary special edition, page 9, 6 March 2009 Kinsley and nearby Nostell Pit were closed in 1986 and 1987 respectively. South Kirkby Colliery closed in 1988. As a result, there was a high level of unemployment in the locality and migration led to it being labelled as a ghost town. Between 2003 and 2006, part of the village was demolished, including the whole of the \\"City estate\\",BBC NEWS  England  Plan to demolish pit village estate to clear derelict properties. In response, Fitzwilliam was included in the Hemsworth Coalfield regeneration area and has received special funding to aid its recovery. The economy improved much in the first decade of the 21st century and unemployment in the Hemsworth seat fell to 3% in 2007, although there are no statistics specifically for Fitzwilliam.

Ellstein's only opera, The Golem, had its world premiere at the New York City Opera under the baton of music director Julius Rudel on March 23, 1962. The libretto was created by the composer and his wife, Sylvia Regan, based on the mythical Golem tale of the Central European Jews. He was born on the Lower East Side, Manhattan, at that time an Eastern European Jewish immigrant area. His musical education began at the Third Street Music School Settlement. From the age of nine to thirteen, he studied piano with Frederick Jacobi. He was the conductor of the boy's choir of the Broadway production \\"Richard III\\", at only thirteen years old. He went on to study at the Graduate School of Juilliard, training as a conductor, with a major in composition.Press Release.

Richardson featured for English clubs Everton, Watford, Arsenal, Aston Villa, Coventry City, Southampton, Barnsley and Blackpool. He also had a spell in La Liga with Real Sociedad. He was also capped for the England national football team. During October 2009 he was appointed as the assistant manager of Darlington. Richardson is currently a coach at Newcastle United's academy. Playing career Richardson was born in Newcastle upon Tyne where he played football for Montagu and North Fenham Boys club. He joined Everton as a schoolboy in 1978 and turned professional in 1980. A versatile midfielder, the young Richardson often had to be content with deputising for the likes of Paul Bracewell, Peter Reid and Kevin Sheedy. However, he still carved out a semi-regular place, and played in the Everton teams that lost the 1984 League Cup Final to Liverpool after a replay and won the FA Cup in 1984. He picked up a First Division title medal and a Cup Winners' Cup medal in May 1985. However, he did not make the squad for the FA Cup final, which Everton lost 1‚Äì0 to Manchester United. In 1985-86, he made 18 First Division appearances for the Toffees and scored three goals as they finished runners-up to Liverpool in the league. A week after the title slipped out of Everton's grasp, they lost the FA Cup final 3‚Äì1 to Liverpool, but Richardson was not in the squad. He made 113 appearances in all for the Toffees, scoring 16 goals. After making one appearance for Everton early in the 1986‚Äì87 season, he was sold to Watford for ¬£225,000, helping the Hornets finish ninth in the First Division and reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup. After one season at Vicarage Road, Richardson was sold to Arsenal for ¬£200,000. Richardson succeeded Graham Rix on the Arsenal left wing, and played in the 1988 League Cup Final as Arsenal lost to Luton Town, before moving over to the right for Arsenal's 1988‚Äì89 title-winning season to cover for the injured Paul Davis. Most notably, Richardson played in Arsenal's dramatic victory at Anfield where they won the title in the last minute of the last game of the season. Now a Championship winner at two different clubs, Richardson continued to be a regular the following season at Arsenal; however, he never totally got on with Gunners manager George Graham and he was transferred to Real Sociedad for ¬£750,000 in the summer of 1990, where he was paired up with new signing Dalian Atkinson and former Liverpool striker John Aldridge. He had made a total of 121 appearances in all competitions for Arsenal, and scored eight goals. Richardson spent one season in Spain before returning to England in the summer of 1991, signing for Ron Atkinson's Aston Villa for ¬£450,000, and was an ever-present in his first two seasons at the club. Richardson became Villa's captain, and led the club to runners-up spot in the inaugural season of the Premier League and victory over Manchester United in the 1994 League Cup Final, in which he won the Man of the Match award. In May 1994, when at the height of his success with Villa, he also won his one and only cap for England, in a 5‚Äì0 friendly victory over Greece on 17 May 1994. Atkinson was sacked as Villa manager in November 1994, with the club struggling near the foot of the Premier League, and his successor Brian Little signed midfielder Ian Taylor the following month. Atkinson was appointed manager of Coventry City three months later, and swiftly made Richardson one of his first signings in a ¬£300,000 deal. Richardson spent the next two-and-a- half years at the Sky Blues repeatedly fending off relegation under both Atkinson and his successor, Gordon Strachan. He left Coventry in September 1997, having scored once in the League Cup against Hull City, and had spells at Southampton, Barnsley and finally Blackpool. Richardson retired from playing in 2000, his career finishing on a low after Blackpool were relegated to Division Three in his final game. Coaching career After retirement, Richardson took up coaching. He became youth team manager at Sunderland, and then Carlton Palmer's assistant at Stockport County in 2001. He returned to Sunderland as reserve team coach in 2004 and became first team coach following the club's takeover by a consortium headed by Niall Quinn. Incoming manager Roy Keane initially retained Richardson in this capacity before replacing him with former Manchester United coach Neil Bailey.

A castle was first built at Mitchelstown in the 15th century by the White Knights of Mitchelstown, from whom, through marriage, it passed to the King family, Barons and Earls of Kingston. James, 4th Baron Kingston, extensively refurbished and modernised the castle in the 1730s. After his death in 1761, the castle passed to his granddaughter, Caroline Fitzgerald. She married her cousin Robert King, Viscount Kingsborough, who was, from 1797, the 2nd Earl of Kingston. The Kingsboroughs demolished most of the old Mitchelstown Castle in the 1770s and incorporated what remained into a new Palladian mansion, described as a 'house with wings'. 19th century In 1823, after his succession, their son, George, 3rd Earl of Kingston, demolished the Palladian house and replaced it with a new castle designed by James and George Richard Pain. It had 60 principal and 20 minor bedrooms, a gallery, three libraries, morning room, dining room (which could seat 100 guests at one sitting) and various other facilities.Mitchelstown Castle profile , mitchelstown.org; accessed 25 April 2016. Mitchelstown Castle was the biggest neo-Gothic house in Ireland, cost ¬£100,000 to build and became the 'fashion statement' of its time. It inspired other major Irish castles, such as Strancally Castle (County Waterford) and Dromoland Castle for Lord Inchiquin. The 100,000-acre Mitchelstown estate ran into considerable financial difficulties, which, after the Great Famine of 1845‚Äì51, forced its owners to sell in the Landed Estates Court. Further difficulties arose as a result of internal family squabbling, legal disputes and the Land War of the 1880s, in which the estate played a prominent part. 20th century In June 1922, the castle was forcibly occupied by the Irish Republican Army. Then owner, William Downes Webber (second husband of Anna, Dowager Countess of Kingston), his relatives and servants were 'evicted' to houses in nearby King Square. Over the next few weeks the castle was held by republicans, who appeared to be preparing it for some kind of siege. However, in early August, the contents of the building were stolen by some republicans, including paintings by Thomas Gainsborough and William Beechey, as well as silver, furniture, wall hangings, and mantlepieces. On 12 August 1922, Mitchelstown Castle was burned on the orders of a local republican leader, Pj luddy, whose father and grandfather had been middlemen on the Kingston estate. At the same time, the military barracks at Fermoy, Mallow, Mitchelstown and Kilworth were burned, as well as the military hospital in Fermoy, Mitchelstown workhouse, Mitchelstown RIC barracks and the railway viaduct in Mallow. Afterwards, William Downes Webber sought compensation from the Irish Free State totalling ¬£149,000 for rebuilding and ¬£18,000 for contents. He intended to rebuild if sufficient compensation was provided. After his death in 1924, Colonel W.A. King-Harman pursued the claim in the Irish courts. Judge Kenny, in the Irish High Court in 1926, stated that the destruction of Mitchelstown Castle had been an act of wanton destruction which had no military purpose. He awarded ¬£27,500 for the building and the entire ¬£18,000 requested for the contents. Most of this was used to build replacement properties in Dublin as King-Harman decided that the award was too small a sum to rebuild the castle. The stones of Mitchelstown Castle were subsequently sold to the Cistercian monks of Mount Melleray Abbey, County Waterford, who used them to build a new abbey. In the 1940s, Mitchelstown Co-operative Agricultural Society built a milk processing factory on the site of the castle, which it had purchased together with some of the demesne lands that surrounded it. The site is now owned by Dairygold Co-op. The coats of arms of Mitchelstown Castle are now held by a local writer and will be erected in Mitchelstown's new public library, which will also have a special section devoted to local history and especially Mitchelstown Castle and its owners. People The proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft was governess there to the children of the household, including Margaret King, later Countess Mount Cashell, to whom Percy Bysshe Shelley dedicated his poem, A Sensitive Plant. Other notable members of the King family included Viscount Kingsborough, author of Antiquities of Mexico. Famous guests at Mitchelstown Castle included George Bernard Shaw, Arthur Young, Elizabeth Bowen and Prince Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau. References Sources * Bill Power.

It is nestled in the valley of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River between hills of the Appalachian Mountains of the Eastern United States. The area was first settled by Europeans in the early-to-middle 19th century. The presence of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River allowed loggers to move their harvest down river. Small farms developed and the town came into existence in 1893 when mining of extensive bituminous coal fields in the area became the dominant industry. The mining companies required skilled workers and many came from Great Britain and Eastern Europe. Railroads were built to transport the coal and the town flourished from economic activity. 1922 mining disaster A mining disaster occurred on November 6, 1922 at Reilly No. 1 Mine. 79 miners were killed when an explosion occurred at 7:20 a.m. as 112 men had begun work. The explosion blew out some stoppings and overcasts and also the side and end walls of the fan housing. Help was called from other mines and from the Bureau of Mines at Pittsburgh. The fan housing was patched and the fan started, making the concrete-lined, 112 foot shaft an intake. Recovery workers without apparatus encountered a live man making his way out to fresh air and brought him and four others out. All were badly affected by mine gases, as were 18 of the rescuers. Apparatus crews were then admitted, and 22 other survivors were rescued. Five other men made their way out unassisted. Seventy-six bodies were found, and three of the rescued men died. The reasons for the explosion were explained. The mine had been rated gaseous in 1918, but at the insistence of the new operators it was rated as non-gaseous although a fireboss was employed and men burned by gas on at least four occasions. The low-volatile dust of the coal helped to spread the explosion. Gas that had accumulated in one or more rooms through open doors and deficient ventilation was ignited by the miners' open lights. Fireboss examinations were neglected and incomplete. A monument constructed to the memory of those lost in this disaster stands in a park near the center of the town. 1971 Fire Claims Firefighter Lives While a winter storm accumulated 11 inches of fresh snow and temperatures near 0 degrees, a fire broke out in Weaver's Variety Shop on January 1, 1971. More than 100 volunteer firefighters from Spangler and surrounding companies fought the fire under severe weather conditions. A wall collapsed killing two firemen, Frank Kinkead, 47, and John DeDea,32, both of nearby Patton, PA. Other firemen were injured. The fire destroyed three buildings, including the old Spangler Theater along the main street, Bigler Avenue. Town planning Because the town of Spangler was laid out with only one main street close to the Susquehanna's riverbed and only one to three parallel streets the town adopted the motto: \\"The Longest Little Town in the World\\" due to the length of the main street, Bigler Avenue. Spangler existed from 1893 until January 1, 2000 when it merged with the adjacent borough of Barnesboro to create the Borough of Northern Cambria. The local public school district is the Northern Cambria School District, whose athletic teams play under the nickname \\"Colts\\" and wear black and gold as the school colors. The current zip code of Northern Cambria is 15714. Spangler is located at 40¬∞39'21\\" North, 78¬∞46'46\\" West (40.655813, -78.779472).

At this point, roadway trusses dating to 1876 were left in place while railroad girders built in 1892 and 1898 were relocated to the Long Bridge in Washington, D.C.\\"Ingenuity Marks Bridge Renewal,\\" Railway Age, vol. 118, No. 3 (Jan 20, 1945): 187-90. On March 31, 1918 the bridge, then owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, was sold to the state governments and tolls were removed. The company was dissolved September 15, 1919 in New Jersey and June 9, 1920 in Pennsylvania. With the removal of tolls, the Lincoln Highway was moved to the bridge from the tolled Calhoun Street Bridge in 1920. The bridge was then designated US Route 1 in 1927; it was replaced by the current bridge in 1928. In 1952 US 1 was moved to the new Trenton-Morrisville Toll Bridge, and for a time the old bridge was designated Alternate US 1. It is now marked as Business US 1, but only on the New Jersey side. The \\"TRENTON MAKES THE WORLD TAKES\\" sign on the south side of the bridge was installed in 1935 and first replaced in 1981. In 2005, the sign was replaced with one featuring higher- efficiency neon lighting, with better waterproofing than the old sign, to help reduce maintenance costs. The slogan was originally \\"The World Takes, Trenton Makes\\" and came from a contest sponsored by the Trenton Chamber of Commerce in 1910. S. Roy Heath, the former Heath Lumber founder and New Jersey State Senator, coined the phrase.

Kevin McKidd plays the central character Frankie, a violent alcoholic who is partially based on Jobson and his brother. The cover of the DVD describes the film as influenced by A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting. The film is Jobson's first directorial effort, following a career as a television presenter on BSkyB and VH-1, and as the vocalist for the 1970s punk rock band The Skids. At the 2003 British Independent Film Awards, the film was nominated for best independent film, and Susan Lynch won the best supporting actor/actress category. The movie was set and filmed in Edinburgh and Aberdour. The soundtrack features 1960s ska and skinhead reggae acts such as Desmond Dekker and Claudette and the Corporation, as well as 1970s rock bands such as Roxy Music, Velvet Underground, Iggy & The Stooges and The Skids. Plot The opening scene shows Frankie being beaten by a small group of men, and the rest of the film is shown as a flashback leading up to that point. The film is split into three sections: Frankie's troubled childhood, his violent adolescence as a ska- loving skinhead who commands a small gang, and a period of change, in which Frankie tries to believe in hope and love. Frankie starts a relationship with Helen (Laura Fraser), a young woman who studies art and works in a record store. When the differences between them became too obvious, Helen breaks up with Frankie, and he joins Alcoholics Anonymous (or a similar program) and a theatre group along with Mary (Susan Lynch), a good-hearted alcoholic. This allows Frankie to exorcise some of his demons, and he loses his desire to fight. An incident in a pub leads Frankie to believe that Mary is cheating on him with the theatre group's director. This reignites doubts created by his parents a long time ago. Feeling deceived, Frankie rejects Mary without a valid reason. When he's preparing to drink a glass of scotch, he begins to muse how the past has destroyed his life up to this point and he decides to stay sober and call Mary to apologise. The events merge with the beginning of the film, and Frankie's former comrades chase and beat him up. Whether Frankie dies or not is left open to the viewer.

He played in the positions of flanker and number eight. Education Skinstad lived in Kloof, KwaZulu-Natal while he attended Highbury Preparatory School, he also attended Fores in Rondebosch, before boarding at Hilton College. His university studies took him to Stellenbosch University where he lived in the Simonsberg men's residence and captained the 'Maties' (University) 1st side. Early career Skinstad was selected by Western Province for the Currie Cup and Super 12, and went on to captain both sides. He then moved to Johannesburg and played the 2003 season for the Golden Lions (Currie Cup) and the Cats (Super 12) before leaving for the United Kingdom. Skinstad was eligible to represent 3 countries at international level: Zimbabwe, South Africa and Ireland, through his Irish mother Alana who hails from County Louth. Springboks Having represented South Africa at all levels, including captaining the under 21 Springbok side in 1996 and 1997, and playing for the SA Sevens team in 1997, Skinstad made his d√©but for the Springboks as a replacement on 29 November 1997 against England. In all he played 42 tests for the Springboks, scoring 11 tries. His inclusion in the 1999 World Cup squad at the expense of successful captain Gary Teichmann was highly controversial in South Africa, and although South Africa finished third in the competition there were many who believed that Teichmann should have been retained as captain for that tournament. Skinstad carried a leg injury into the competition, and made little impression. Skinstad captained the Springboks in 12 tests, since 24 October 2003. Semi- retirement in Britain In January 2004 Skinstad terminated his contract with SA Rugby and signed with Newport Gwent Dragons in Wales, for whom he played just 9 games. He then worked with a group, including businessmen Johann Rupert and Wayne Huizenga trying to take over an English club in London and played part-time for Richmond in England's London South-East Division 1. He was also a regular player for the Barbarians and has captained them on several occasions. In December 2006 Bob played alongside his friend, former Scottish international Kenny Logan in the Dubai 7's for 'Stefan BHF' to raise awareness for the British Heart Foundation in memory of the late Stefan Czerpak, ex England colts Newbury RFC and Richmond RFC rugby coach who died in 1998 from a heart attack.

He has worked as an analyst and occasional presenter covering the Super 14, Currie Cup and NPC Tournaments for Sky Sports. Return to South Africa After months of speculation about a return to professional rugby, Skinstad returned to Super 14 rugby in 2007 playing for the Sharks. He made his return coming off the bench against the Highlanders in New Zealand, and went on to make another 9 appearances, including a substitute's role in the final. He was rewarded with a recall to the Springbok training camp in May 2007, and when Danie Rossouw was taken ill, Skinstad was named on the bench for the second test against England on 2 June, continuing a remarkable comeback. He then was chosen as captain for the Boks' 2007 Tri Nations match against Australia on 7 July, when coach Jake White rested several senior players in preparation for the World Cup. An experienced Boks side took a surprising 17‚Äì0 lead before fading to lose 25‚Äì17. Despite suffering a broken rib in the Australia match, Skinstad would see his comeback capped off on 21 July with selection to the South Africa squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He only played and captained one full game in South Africa's winning campaign, and made three further appearances as a substitute. He retired from professional rugby on 6 November 2007.

Coornhert is often considered the Father of Dutch Renaissance scholarship. Biography Coornhert was the youngest son of Volckert Coornhert, an Amsterdam cloth merchant. As a child he spent some years in Spain and Portugal. Returning home, he was disinherited by his father's will in 1539, for his marriage with Cornelia (Neeltje) Simons, a portionless gentlewoman from Haarlem, whose sister was Anna Simonsdr, the mistress of Reginald (Reinoud), count of Brederode (they were the parents of Lucretia van Brederode). He was only seventeen and she was twelve years older. Through his sister-in-law, he became major-domo to Reginald at his castle in Vianen for a short time. Soon after that, in 1541, he bought a house in his wife's home town of Haarlem on the St. Janssteeg from Anna and her husband Jan. Though he started off working for Reginald, he lived near the school where the St. Jan commanderij taught classic works and commissioned art. Maarten van Heemskerck had just returned from Italy and impressed Coornhert with his work. Coornhert became an engraver on copper, and produced works in collaboration with Heemskerck which became popular.Biography of Coornhert by Ilja M. Veldman, Zutphen, 1989, in the DBNL (with prints) Charles V conquers Tunisia, one of a series of prints drafted by Heemskerck and engraved by Coornhert. This series was noted by Karel van Mander in his Schilderboeck. After learning Latin in 1552, Coornhert published Dutch translations from Cicero, Seneca and Boethius. His 1562 translation of the first twelve books of Homer's Odyssey is one of the first major works of Dutch Renaissance poetry. He was appointed secretary to the city of Haarlem (1562) and secretary to the burgomasters (1564). Throwing himself into the struggle against Spanish rule, he drew up the manifesto of William the Silent, Prince of Orange (1566). Imprisoned at the Hague in 1568, he escaped to Cleves, where he maintained himself by his art. Recalled in 1572, he was for a short time secretary of state in the Dutch Republic; his aversion to military violence led him to return to Cleves, where William continued to employ his services and his pen. Possibly inspired by his time in jail, he wrote a book \\"Boeventucht\\" on the causes of crime with ideas for more humane methods of punishment and correction. Theology Coornhert was also famous as a theologian. At 30 years of age, having become interested in theology, and being desirous of consulting St. Augustine, he commenced the study of Latin. He entered into controversy alike with Catholics and Reformers, with both of whom he refused to communicate. Reformers, he said, were sadly wanted, but those who called themselves such were not the kind that the church required; what was needed was apostles directly inspired from heaven. Until such were sent, he advised all churches to join together in an undogmatic communion. Coornhert wrote and strove in favor of tolerance, opposing capital punishment for heretics. He had no party views; he criticized the Heidelberg Catechism, which was authoritative in the Dutch Republic. Jacobus Arminius, employed to refute him, was won over by his arguments. Pupils According to the Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD), his pupils were Hendrick Goltzius, Philip Galle, and Cornelis Cort.Dirck Volckertsz. Coornhert in the RKD Works In addition to the 1566 manifesto, Coornhert wrote a treatise against the capital punishment of heretics, a pamphlet defending the rebellion of the United Provinces, a preface to the Dutch grammar published by the Society of Rhetoricians of Amsterdam, and a number of poems, including, according to some, the popular song, Wilhelmus van Nassouwe. Others, however, attributed it to Philip van Marnix. In 1586 he produced his original masterpiece, the Zedekunst (\\"Art of Ethics\\"). By the time he died in 1590, his Dutch translation of the New Testament (following the Latin version of Erasmus) was left unfinished. His collected works, in prose and verse, were published in 1630 in 3 volumes. Isaac D'Israeli called him \\"one of the fathers of Dutch literature, and even of their arts.\\" Quotes *\\"Each wants to dictate another's creed ...

In 1957, the product line was expanded to include juice concentrates, and in 1962, Schwan's began selling frozen fish products. During the 1970s, the company began selling pizza to schools, launched the Red Baron pizza brand for sale in grocery stores, and formed the Red Baron Squadron flight team to promote the brand. During the 1980s, Schwan's made further acquisitions, including pizza manufacturer Sabatasso Foods and Asian-foods manufacturer Minh Food Corporation. Schwan's opened a plant in Leyland, Preston, England in 1989. In 1990 Schwans started Schwans Canada, with an ice cream plant in Manitoba and routes in Saskatchewan and Alberta, but they ceased operations in December 1999.

In October 1994, the Minnesota Department of Health informed the company that 67 people in southern Minnesota had been infected with salmonella enteritis and that there was a strong statistical link between the illnesses and Schwan's ice cream. Schwan quickly halted the production and sale of the company's ice cream and began a public-awareness campaign asking people not to eat Schwan's ice cream products. An investigation found that the source of the contamination was a contractor's truck that had delivered ice cream pre-mix to Schwan's. The trucking company had inadequately washed the tanker truck after transporting raw, unpasteurized eggs.Schwan's Salmonella Recall. National Institutes of Health. May 1996.

History Leon Bean as a child and his mother, Sarah Bean was born in the town of Greenwood, Maine, on October 13, 1872, to Benjamin Warren Bean and Sarah (Swett) Bean, one of six sons. According to a grandson of Leon L. Bean, the latter's middle name may have been originally \\"Linwood\\" and accidentally changed to \\"Leonwood\\". In fact, in the Freeport Town Clerk's Report for the 1898‚Äì1899 period, a \\"Leon Linwood Bean\\" married a \\"Bertha Davis Porter\\" on September 28, 1898.Town of Freeport, Town Records for 1898‚Äì1899, Town Clerk's Report, p. 88. Bean showed an early interest in business, earning his first money when he was nine years old. He learned that he could either attend the local fair or sell steel traps to his father, so he decided to sell the traps. When Bean was 13 years old, he killed and sold his first deer. Bean's schooling outside of public school included only one semester at Hebron Academy and a course in business at Kents Hill School. Bean's parents died four days apart when Bean was 12 years old. He subsequently moved to South Paris, Maine to stay with family.  Foundation of L.L.Bean  Bean was an avid hunter and fisherman. In his outdoor activities, his boots would become soaked with water, so he set out to resolve this inconvenience and developed plans for a waterproof boot. The boot was a combination of lightweight leather for the upper part and rubber on the bottom. He brought the plans to a cobbler and the first boots were made. Bean felt the boot produced to be of good quality, and obtained a list of non-resident Maine hunting license holders and prepared a descriptive mail order circular. He promised 100% money back for anyone who was unhappy with the boots. Because of this, Bean had to refund 90% of the costs of the first 100 sets of boots made, when the rubber on the bottom developed cracks. He seemed not to mind returning the money, and the popularity of the boots was clear. In 1911, he took out a loan in the amount of US$400 and set off to Boston, where he offered the United States Rubber Company the remainder of his US$400 to produce a better quality boot for him. With the better quality boots available, Bean set up a boot shop in his brother's basement in Freeport, Maine. His skills and trials as an entrepreneur, along with his promise to return 100% money back on all items, were detailed by many local and national newspapers of the time. By 1917, he had sold enough of his boots to buy a dedicated building for his shop on the main street of Freeport. In 1918, Bean realised the importance of patenting his invention. As the patent was granted, he moved on to inventing and improving more outdoor equipment and expanding his store to what L.L.Bean is today.  As an author  Bean published a book in 1942, called Hunting, Fishing and Camping and an autobiography, in 1960, called My Story: the Autobiography of a Down-East Merchant.\\"  Death and legacy  Bean died in Pompano Beach, Florida, on February 5, 1967, at the age of 94. He was buried in Webster Cemetery in Freeport, Maine. At the time of his death, the annual sales of his company were in the hundreds of millions. Company policy of giving 100% money back on returned products applied until February 9, 2018. Maine Medical Center has named one of its wings in his honor. In addition, his portrait hangs in a ground-floor corridor at the hospital.  References  External links * Finding L.L.

Chew held a PhD in theoretical particle physics (1944‚Äì1946) from the University of Chicago. Between 1950 and 1956, he was a physics faculty member at the University of Illinois. In addition, Chew was a member of the National Academy of Sciences as well as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Faculty: Geoffrey F. Chew, Physics at Berkeley, Department of Physics University of California (accessed 2 April 2012). He was also a founding member of the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (CIRET). Chew was a student of Enrico Fermi. His students include David Gross, one of the winners of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, and John H. Schwarz, one of the pioneers of string theory. Work Chew was known as a leader of the S-matrix approach to the strong interaction and the associated bootstrap principle, a theory whose popularity peaked in the 1960s when he led an influential theory group at the University of California, Berkeley. S-matrix theorists sought to understand the strong interaction by using the analytic properties of the scattering matrix to calculate the interactions of bound-states without assuming that there is a point-particle field theory underneath. The S-matrix approach did not provide a local space-time description. Although it was not immediately appreciated by the practitioners, it was a natural framework in which to produce a quantum theory of gravity. Chew's central contribution to the program came in 1961: along with collaborator Steven Frautschi, they noted that the mesons fall into families (straight-line Regge trajectories) where the square of the mass of a meson is linearly proportional to the spin (in their scheme, spin is plotted against mass squared on a so-called Chew‚ÄìFrautschi plot), with the same constant of proportionality for each of the families. Since bound states in quantum mechanics naturally fall into families of this sort, their conclusion, quickly accepted, was that none of the strongly interacting particles were elementary. The conservative point of view was that the bound states were made up of elementary particles, but Chew's more far-reaching vision was that there would be a new type of theory which describes the interactions of bound-states which have no point-like constituents at all. This approach was sometimes called nuclear democracy, since it avoided singling out certain particles as elementary. Legacy Although the S-matrix approach to the strong interactions was largely abandoned by the particle physics community in the 1970s in favor of quantum chromodynamics, a consistent theory for the scattering of bound-states on straight-line trajectories was eventually constructed and is nowadays known as string theory. Within string theory, Edward Witten reinterpreted S-matrix theory as a flat-space statement of the holographic principle. Professor Chew also participated in religion and science discussions. He stated that an \\"appeal to God may be needed to answer the 'origin' question, 'Why should a quantum universe evolving toward a semiclassical limit be consistent?'\\" pages 33-36 of co-edited with Roy Abraham Varghese. This book is mentioned in a December 28, 1992 Time magazine article: Galileo And Other Faithful Scientists Chew investigated into models in which the concept of happenings or (pre-)events play a fundamental role, not only particles. He saw similarities among his approach and the notion of occasion of Alfred North Whitehead.Physics and Whitehead Workshop , August 5‚Äì6, 1998 Awards Chew received the Hughes Prize of the American Physics Society for his bootstrap theory of strong interactions in 1962.

The term is derived from the Latin word contumacia, meaning firmness or stubbornness. In English ecclesiastical law, it was contempt of the authority of an ecclesiastical court and was dealt with by the issue of a writ from the Court of Chancery at the instance of the judge of the ecclesiastical court. This writ took the place of the de excommunicato capiendo in 1813, by an act of George III; see excommunication. In the U.S., while not expressly mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, the courts have long asserted an inherent power of judges to punish such refusal, which in this context is known as contempt of court. The U.S. Supreme Court recognized federal courts' inherent power to imprison a person for contumacy in United States v. Hudson & Goodwin without a reference to a definition of contumacy in common or statutory law.United States v.

He was a major instigator in the development of both international football and cricket, as well as being the creator of the FA Cup. Early life and career Alcock was born in Sunderland on 2 December 1842, the second son of the elder Charles Alcock, a ship builder and owner, and his wife Elizabeth. From 1853 to 1859, Alcock attended Harrow School. By the time young Charles left Harrow, his family had moved from Sunderland to Chingford, Essex. Charles senior subsequently established a marine insurance business in the City of London. Footballer =Forest / Wanderers= In 1859, Charles, along with his elder brother John Forster Alcock, was a founder of Forest Football Club, based in Leytonstone, Essex. As Charles Alcock would later write: In March 1862, both brothers played for Forest in a home 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace FC. Charles was a prime mover in the 1863 foundation of Forest's more famous successor, Wanderers F.C., who were initially a predominantly Old Harrovian side. Alcock captained Wanderers to triumph in the very first FA Cup final, in 1872. During this match, he put the ball in the opponents' goal, but the score was disallowed because of an earlier handball. For their influence on the game of football the Wanderers were considered as early as 1870 to be the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) of football.The Sporting Gazette, 12 March 1870, account of international match of 5 March 1870 =England= Alcock captained the England team in all five of the England v Scotland matches from 1870-72, which are not now recognized as full internationals becsause the \\"Scotland\\" team contained only London-based players. On 6 March 1875, he captained England in a full international against Scotland, scoring a goal in a 2‚Äì2 draw.England 2 - 2 Scotland, Saturday, 6th March 1875 englandstats.com =Other matches= Alcock represented the \\"London\\" (FA) team in the London v Sheffield match of 1866, scoring a goal that was disallowed for offside. =Playing style= Alcock was a proponent and pioneer of modern football playing styles that employed teamwork and passing. As early as 1870 Alcock was the first to recognise the benefit of playing football in a \\"scientific\\" way. Alcock himself was one of the earliest soccer players to be described in contemporary reports as showing teamwork between players, for example in the 1871 England versus Scotland international: > \\"indeed it seemed as if the [Scottish] defence would prove more than equal > to the attack until a well executed run down by C W Alcock WC Butler and RSF > Walker, acting in concert, enabled the last named of the trio to equalise > the score by the accomplishment of a well merited goal\\"The Scotsman, 27 > February 1871, p. 7 In 1874 Alcock was the first to advocate the predecessor of the modern passing style known as the \\"Combination game\\": \\"Nothing succeeds better than what I may call a 'combination game'\\"Alcock (1874) He attributed to Sheffield FC the beginning of the modern passing game. In a discussion on the history of a \\"definite scheme of attack\\" and \\"elaborate combination\\" in football playing style, Alcock noted (in 1891): \\"The perfection of the system which is in vogue at the present time however is in a very great measure the creation of the last few years. The Cambridge University eleven of 1883 were the first to illustrate the full possibilities of a systematic combination giving full scope to the defence as well as the attack\\"CW Alcock (1891) \\"Association Football\\", The English Illustrated Magazine, p. 287 Football administrator Forest FC was one of the founding clubs of the Football Association (FA), the club being represented in the first 1863 meetings by Charles's elder brother John (as club captain) and A. W. Mackenzie (as club secretary). John Alcock was elected to the FA's committee in December 1863, serving until February 1866, when he was replaced by Charles. =FA Committee Member (1866-1870)= At the FA's annual meeting in February 1867, Charles Alcock expressed the view that \\"a little more energy was required to establish the game on a sure footing\\", and suggested an extraordinary meeting of the association ought to be held during the Christmas holidays with a view to increasing the acceptance of the FA's rules by schools and universities. He also argued successfully for the law-change proposed by Wanderers FC to eliminate the \\"touch down\\" tie- breaker from the FA laws, and against several alterations suggested by Sheffield FC that would have introduced features from Sheffield rules football into the FA code, saying that his proposed changes would be \\"the only step to inducing the public schools to join\\" the association. In October 1867, Alcock was given the responsibility for selecting the \\"Middlesex\\" players for the inaugural county match between Middlesex and a \\"Surrey and Kent XI\\". =FA Secretary (1870-1895)= In 1870, Alcock was elected honorary secretary and treasurer of the FA, replacing Robert Graham in both roles. He served as secretary for 25 years (unpaid until 1887). His unprecedently long tenure encompassed the establishment of international matches, the introduction of the FA Cup, the unification of Sheffield rules football with association football, and the introduction of professionalism. First international match Alcock was one of those responsible for the first ever international soccer match (and subsequent early international games) with Scotland. The first two of these took place in 1870, with later matches in 1871 and 1872. After the 1870 games there was resentment in Scotland that their team did not contain more home grown players and some of this fire was aimed at Alcock. Alcock himself was categorical about the international standing of the 1870 games and where he felt responsibility lay for the inclusion of so many England-based players in the Scotland team, writing in the Scotsman newspaper: > \\"I must join issue with your correspondent in some instances. First, I > assert that of whatever the Scotch eleven may have been composed the right > to play was open to every Scotchman [Alcock's italics] whether his lines > were cast North or South of the Tweed and that if in the face of the > invitations publicly given through the columns of leading journals of > Scotland the representative eleven consisted chiefly of Anglo-Scotians ... > the fault lies on the heads of the players of the north, not on the > management who sought the services of all alike impartially. To call the > team London Scotchmen contributes nothing. The match was, as announced, to > all intents and purposes between England and Scotland\\".\\"Charles W Alcock\\", > The Scotsman, 28 November 1870, p. 7 Alcock then proceeded to offer further challenges with a Scottish team drawn from Scotland and proposed the north of England as a compromise venue to take into account travelling distances. Although not currently recognised by FIFA as official, the Scotsman newspaper described the 1870 and 1871 games as \\"international\\" and in italics. One reason for the absence of a response to Alcock's early challenges may have been different football codes being followed in Scotland at the time. A written reply to Alcock's letter above states: \\"Mr Alcock's challenge to meet a Scotch eleven on the borders sounds very well and is doubtless well meant. But it may not be generally well known that Mr Alcock is a very leading supporter of what is called the \\"association game\\"... devotees of the \\"association\\" rules will find no foemen worthy of their steel in Scotland\\".The Scotsman, 1 December 1870, p. 12 Alcock appeared to be particularly concerned about the number of players in Scottish football teams at the time, adding: \\"More than eleven we do not care to play as it is with greater numbers it is our opinion the game becomes less scientific and more a trial of charging and brute force... Charles W Alcock, Hon Sec of Football Association and Captain of English Eleven\\". In 1872 Alcock's was behind the statement that 'To further the interests of the Association in Scotland, it was decided that during the current season, a team should be sent to Glasgow to play a match v Scotland' in the FA's minutes of 3 October 1872. The 1872 international match took place between England and Scotland on 30 November, with Alcock ruled out of the England side which drew 0‚Äì0 at the West of Scotland Cricket Ground in Partick through injury sustained two weeks earlier, playing for Old Harrovians against Old Etonians. Instead he represented his country as umpire, with the England captaincy awarded to Cuthbert Ottaway. FA Cup On 20 July 1871, Alcock, in his position as FA Secretary, proposed 'That it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association, for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete'. Thus, the FA Cup ‚Äì the world's first national football tournament, based on Alcock's experience of inter-house 'sudden death' competition at Harrow ‚Äì was born. Fifteen teams took part in the first competition in 1872, with Alcock captaining the winning Wanderers side. It was only fitting that the final should be played at The Oval, since Alcock had become Secretary of Surrey County Cricket Club the previous month. After joining the FA committee in 1866, Alcock served as FA Secretary from 1870 to 1895, before serving as vice-president. Alcock refereed the 1875 and 1879 FA Cup Finals, and was the journalist responsible for editing the Football Annual from its foundation in 1868 until his death. Cricket In cricket, Alcock captained Middlesex in the first county match in 1867, before playing for Essex. He played only one first-class fixture, for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), in 1862 (Essex was not yet a first-class county).Statistics, CricketArchive.co.uk website. Between 1872 and 1907, Alcock served as secretary of Surrey. Repeating his interest in sporting internationals, he arranged the first cricket Test match to be played in England, England against Australia at the Kennington Oval in 1880 He also edited the Cricket newspaper for almost a quarter of a century, and edited James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual from 1872 to 1900.

It claims to manufacture one out of every five beverage cans used in the world, and one out of every three food cans used in North America and Europe. The company is ranked No. 338 in the Fortune 500 list for 2017 and is number one in the packaging and container industry for the same list. History Cork oak tree planted and dedicated by Jimmie H. Davis at the Crown Cork plant in Louisiana. William Painter, an Irish-born American, invented the crown cap for bottled carbonated beverages in 1891, and obtained patents 468,226 and 468,258 for it on February 2, 1892. He founded his own manufacturing business, the Crown Cork and Seal Company, in Baltimore and set out on a campaign to convince bottlers that his cap was the right one to use on their products. By 1898, he had created a foot-powered crowner device to sell to bottlers and retailers so that they could seal the bottles with his caps quickly and easily. This helped gain acceptance of his bottle caps. By 1906, Crown had opened manufacturing plants in Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. In 1927, after a merger with New Process Cork Company, Crown Cork and Seal Company was established in New York City. Crown Cork International Corporation was established in the subsequent year in order to assist subsidiaries engaged in bottle crown and other cork business outside the United States. By the 1930s Crown was selling half of the world's supply of bottle caps. Crown entered the tin can business in 1936 with the purchase of the Acme Can Company of Philadelphia, which led to the creation of the Crowntainer, a funnel-shaped beer can, the following year. To address market changes after World War I and Prohibition, Crown then focused heavily on soft drinks. During World War II, Crown produced war products such as the Kork-N-Seal, the Pour-N-Seal, and the Merit Seal, as well as gas mask canisters. John Connelly took over presidency of the company and moved the headquarters from Baltimore to Philadelphia in the late 1950s. In 2003, Crown restructured as a public holding company. In 2005 and 2006 Crown exited the plastics industry with the sale of its Global Plastic Closure and its cosmetics packaging businesses.

Overview  Syntax-directed translation fundamentally works by adding actions to the productions in a context-free grammar, resulting in a Syntax-Directed Definition (SDD).Aho, Alfred V. Compilers: Principles, Techniques, & Tools. Boston: Pearson/Addison Wesley, 2007. Actions are steps or procedures that will be carried out when that production is used in a derivation. A grammar specification embedded with actions to be performed is called a syntax-directed translation scheme (sometimes simply called a 'translation scheme'.) Each symbol in the grammar can have an attribute, which is a value that is to be associated with the symbol. Common attributes could include a variable type, the value of an expression, etc. Given a symbol X, with an attribute t, that attribute is referred to as X.t Thus, given actions and attributes, the grammar can be used for translating strings from its language by applying the actions and carrying information through each symbol's attribute.  Metacompilers  Early metacompilers use the terms syntax-driven and syntax-directed translation in their descriptions. They have metaprogramming language features for outputting code. See metacompiler, META II, and TREE-META.

Primary use Cheater bars are usually used to free threaded pipe, screws, bolts, and other fasteners that are difficult to remove with a ratchet or pipe wrench alone. Cheater bars are also commonly used to operate valves. When the handle of a pipe wrench, box wrench or ratchet is inserted into a cheater bar, the additional distance makes it possible to generate the required torque with the same amount of force being applied. However, the work done is the same with or without the cheater bar because the torque and angle of rotation needed to accomplish a particular task does not change. The cheater bar allows higher torque with the same force by: \\\\text{torque} = \\\\text{radius} \\\\times \\\\text{force} A cheater bar is sometimes called a snipe, a pipe extension or an extension pipe. Industrial safety problems Problems in using such bars include: * All respected international and governmental safety organizations and enforcement agencies such as OSHA, MSHA, CCOHS, EU-OSHA, etc. strictly prohibit or vehemently discourage the use of cheater bars due to the extreme risk of injury or death to users and bystanders. * If the component frees suddenly, the worker can become a projectile that is propelled into whatever is in the \\"line-of-fire\\". This could (and has) resulted in falls, impacts, punctures, and other injuries. * The cheater bar itself can become part of a de facto catapult with the worker in the line-of-fire.DOE  Office of Health, Safety and Security  Corporate Safety Analysis * If the over-torqueing results in the failure of any of the items in the jury rig, the fragments can injure workers in the line-of- fire.Using cheater bars on hand tools * The use of the cheater bar can result in component damage that can, in turn, harm workers.Power Engineering - Valve Vigilance Pump or fluid transport equipment problems Ports of pumps can be damaged resulting in: * The outlet or inlet ports can be warped. * The pump casting or manifold can crack and then leak. Some organizations forbid their use. For example, NASA is one such organization: > \\"Use the approved tool for the job. Makeshift arrangements such as the use > of a screwdriver as a chisel, a pair of pliers as a wrench, a wrench as a > hammer, or overloading a wrench by using a pipe extension (cheater bar) on > the handle are not to be employed.\\" Alternatives Due to the potential problems associated with a cheater bar or snipe, some situations may require an alternative to loosening and removing threaded pipe, screws, bolts or other fasteners. * Hydraulic Chain Pipe Wrench ‚Äì A hydraulic driven wrench which will safely remove threaded pipe from other threaded coupling, valve, etc. while the other devices listed here are for loosening (breaking) nuts. Torque values available vary with size but range up to approximately 75,000 FT-LB. * Impact wrench ‚Äì An air powered socket wrench that delivers high torque output by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft. Nearly every auto body or mechanic shop will have an air compressor and impact wrench to loosen and tighten lug nuts on wheels. How Does An Impact Wrench Work? Most major tool manufacturers carry an air impact wrench, including DeWalt, Ingersoll, and Paoli SRL. * Torque multiplier ‚Äì Uses a multi-stage epicyclic gearing mechanism to multiply torque output. Torque is applied to the input gear which engages with a number of planet gears which are held in a fixed planetary gear. By using a reaction arm, the outside casing of the multiplier is prevented from rotating, causing the planet gears to rotate around the input gear. Along with the multiplication of torque, there is a decrease in rotational speed of the output shaft compared to the input shaft. This decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the increase in torque. Introduction To Torque Multipliers Torque multipliers come in a variety of output ratios as well. * Pneumatic torque wrench ‚Äì Operates like the torque multiplier but is mated to a pneumatic air motor. It is essentially a mix of the compressed air powered impact wrench and the traditionally hand-operated torque multiplier, delivering aspects of both tools.

Founded in 1943 by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the agency provides assistance to 130 million people in more than 110 countries and territories in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. A member of Caritas International, the worldwide network of Catholic humanitarian agencies, CRS provides relief in emergencies and helps people in the developing world break the cycle of poverty through community-based, sustainable development initiatives as well as Peacebuilding. Assistance is based solely on need, not race, creed or nationality. Catholic Relief Services is headquartered in the Posner Building in Baltimore, Maryland, while operating numerous field offices on five continents. CRS has approximately 5,000 employees around the world. The agency is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of 13 clergy (most of them bishops) and 10 lay people. History Initially founded as the War Relief Services, the agency's original purpose was to aid the refugees of war- torn Europe. A confluence of events in the mid 1950s ‚Äî the end of colonial rule in many countries, the continuing support of the American Catholic community and the availability of food and financial resources from the U.S. Government ‚Äî helped CRS expand operations. Its name was officially changed to Catholic Relief Services in 1955, and over the next 10 years it opened 25 country programs in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. In Asia, CRS supplied food rations to the Republic of Vietnam Military Forces.https://africanactivist.msu.edu/document_metadata.php?objectid=32-130-696 CRS's executive director during this period (1947‚Äì1976) was Bishop Edward E. Swanstrom. One of the key relief workers in those early years was Father Fabian Flynn, CP, who directed their efforts in Germany, Austria, and Hungary.Sean Brennan The Priest who put Europe Back Together: The Life of Father Fabian Flynn, CP (Washington, DC: The Catholic University of America Press, 2018) As the agency grew, its programming focus widened, adapting to meet the needs of the post-World War II Roman Catholic Church and the circumstances of the people it encountered. In the 1970s and 1980s, programs that began as simple distributions of food, clothing and medicines to the poor evolved toward socio-economic development. By the late 1980s, health care, nutrition education, micro enterprise and agriculture had become major focuses of CRS programming. In the mid-1990s, CRS went through a significant institutional transformation. In 1993, CRS officials embarked on a strategic planning effort to clarify the mission and identity of the agency. Soon after, the 1994 massacre in Rwanda ‚Äì in which more than 800,000 people were killed ‚Äì led CRS staff to reevaluate how they implemented their relief and development programs, particularly in places experiencing or at high risk of ethnic conflict. After a period of institutional reflection, CRS embraced a vision of global solidarity and incorporated a justice-centered focus into all of its programming, using Catholic social teaching as a guide. All programming is evaluated according to a set of social justice criteria called the Justice Lens. In terms of programming, CRS now evaluates not just whether its interventions are effective and sustainable, but whether they might have a negative impact on social or economic relationships in a community. Activities CRS programming promotes human development by: * responding to major emergencies, * fighting disease and poverty, * nurturing peaceful and just societies, *emergency relief in the wake of disasters and civil conflict, *long-term development programming in the areas of agriculture, water, community health, education, health, HIV/AIDS, micro finance and peace building. CRS also serves Catholics in the United States to help live their faith in solidarity with their brothers and sisters around the world. In 2019, CRS released its new agency strategy, Vision 2030,https://www.crs.org/about/agency-strategy centered around upholding human dignity by cultivating just and peaceful societies, accelerating the end of poverty, hunger, and preventable diseases, and alleviating suffering worldwide. In order to make these aspirations a reality, the organization outlined five goal areas to focus on between 2020 and 2030. CRS has dedicated itself to ensuring that: # All people live in just and peaceful societies, # All people survive and thrive in the face of disasters, # All people achieve dignified and resilient livelihoods in flourishing landscapes, # All children reach their full health and development potential in safe and nurturing families and, # All youth are empowered to thrive. These goals also connect with and support the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals of: no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth, sustainable cities and communities, life on land, and peace, justice and strong institutions. =Overseas= CRS' work overseas is done in partnership with local church agencies, other faith-based partners, non-governmental organizations and local governments. CRS emphasizes the empowerment of partners and program participants in programming decisions. Program examples include: *Agriculture ‚Äî CRS‚Äô immediate goal is to improve family well-being through agro-economic development and environmental stewardship. The long-term goal is to strengthen the capacity of local communities to take control of their own development.Agriculture * Education - CRS supports local communities and partners to provide the best education possible for the children living around the world.https://www.crs.org/our-work-overseas/program-areas/education Currently, the organization has education programs in 35 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. These programs include early childhood development, providing school breakfast and lunches, and primary, secondary and higher education. In several countries, including Afghanistan and Egypt, CRS is particularly focused on improving the educational opportunities for refugees and girls, two groups who sometimes have their educational needs overlooked. *Emergency Response ‚Äî Natural and human-caused disasters disproportionately affect the lives of the poor. CRS works to ensure that disaster-affected populations are at least able to meet their basic needs and live a life with dignity. The agency works directly with affected communities and local partners to help restore and strengthen their pre-disaster capacities.Emergency Response * Peacebuilding ‚Äî The agency's commitment to global solidarity led CRS to adopt peacebuilding as an agency-wide priority. Peacebuilding in this context is defined as the long- term project of building peaceful, stable communities and societies. CRS assembled a team of regional advisors and a headquarters-based technical staff to work with partners, and peacebuilding projects were started in dozens of countries. Each summer, CRS conducts training programs for its staff and overseas partners at the Mindanao Peace Institute in the Philippines and at University of Notre Dame's Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. An increasing number of bishops from developing countries have attended these sessions.Peacebuilding * Youthhttps://www.crs.org/our-work- overseas/program-areas/youth \\\\- CRS believes that all youth, even those affected by poverty and surrounded by conflict, have the ability to become leaders and create change in their lives and communities. Together with local communities, partners, and governments, CRS helps youth around the world access quality education, learn good economic practices, strengthen their knowledge around agriculture, and become confident in their abilities to foster peace in their communities. CRS' YouthBuild program in Central America has already reached more than 20,000 youth and helped 40% of them find jobs in the local communities.https://www.crs.org/our-work-overseas/program- areas/youth/youth-employment =In the United States= The agency has also made engaging the U.S. Catholic population a priority. In 2018, CRS created a new division dedicated to this outreach called \\"Mission and Mobilization.\\" At the heart of this new division are the nationwide CRS Chapters, which bring together Catholics and others of goodwill who want to put their faith into action. Through fundraising campaigns, educational sessions, and advocacy actions like writing to their Congressional representatives, the CRS Chapter members work together to help speak for, support, and advocate for policies that favor some of the most vulnerable people around the world. Most recently, CRS Chapter members played an integral part in ensuring the September 22nd House passage of H.R. 4864, the Global Child Thrive Act.https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4864 Members of CRS Chapters also support Mission and Mobilization's new Lead the Way on Hunger and Lead the Way on Migration campaigns. One of the oldest ways for U.S. Catholics to support the organization is through CRS Rice Bowl. Established in 1977, millions of parishioners, students, and teachers participate in CRS' Lenten program, which emphasizes prayer, fasting, learning, and giving. Materials offer daily prayers, recipes for simple meals and stories that teach about life in the developing world. The bowl itself, a symbol of both hunger and hope, is used to collect funds for those in need. Seventy-five percent of funds raised support development programs in Africa, Asia, and Latin America - such as the provision of food, access to clean water and meeting other essential needs.https://www.ncregister.com/news/four- looming-famines-highlight-need-for-crs-rice-bowl The remaining twenty-five percent stays in the diocese for local poverty and hunger alleviation projects.https://www.crsricebowl.org/about Catholic Relief Services serves as a leading member of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a Washington D.C.-based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for increased funding of American diplomatic and development efforts abroad.U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, Global Trust members Emergency Responses =COVID-19 Pandemic= Like other humanitarian organizations, the COVID-19 pandemichttps://www.crs.org/media-center/current-issues/coronavirus-facts-and- how-help required CRS to adjust its programming to keep staff and those it serves safe. At the beginning of 2020, most CRS country programs were able to continue their work by carrying out programs remotely. Due to global lockdowns, the shift from in-person work to virtual work was necessary. As lockdowns began to ease, programs were started up again immediately, meeting global requirements like physical distancing and wearing of masks. A big component of CRS' response has included public information and awareness campaigns, drawing on the organization's experience with Ebola. Throughout the countries were CRS works, staff have also been installing hand-washing stations in community areas like schools and markets. CRS has been vocal in calling for the U.S. Congress and Trump administration to pass COVID-19 emergency funding bills providing support for those suffering from COVID-19 both within the United States and overseas. As of October 2020, CRS has COVID-19 specific programming in 73 countries and is supporting healthcare facilities with their COVID-19 response in 34 of those countries. =2019 Cyclones Idai and Kenneth= In early 2019, Southern Africa was hit by back- to-back cyclones, Idai in March and Kenneth in April. Combined, more than 1,300 people were killed and the cyclones caused more than US$2.3 billion in damage. The cyclones hit areas of Southern Africa already experiencing drought followed by severe rains and flooding. Cyclone Idai flooded more than 407,000 acres of farmland in Mozambique, making food insecurity worse for the country. After Cyclone Idai hit, CRS and local church partners provided emergency shelter in the hardest-hit areas, as well as distributed emergency items like hygiene kits and clean water.https://www.ncronline.org/news/world/cyclone- slams-africa-churches-aid-agencies-coordinate- responsehttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/world/africa/how-to-help-cyclone- idai.html Cyclone Kenneth hit less than a month later, flattening entire villages and leaving more than 150,000 people in Mozambique alone homeless. The second cyclone increased an already dangerous situation, as most emergency supplies were depleted after Cyclone Idai hit the region. Despite this, CRS worked with local governments in Mozambique to provide emergency shelter, food, and other life-saving supplies to families in Pemba.https://www.ncronline.org/news/earthbeat/aid-workers-struggle-reunite- kids-families-after-mozambique-cyclones =2018 Super Typhoon Mangkhut= More than 600,000 people in the Philippines were affected by Super Typhoon Mangkhut, which hit the island in September 2018. Nearly 1.6 million farmers and fishermen were affected by the storm, and the country lost between 80 and 90% of its rice and corn crops. Distant villages were initially difficult to reach, as debris and landslides covered several roads across the country. CRS responded with water purification tablets and jerry cans for families sheltering in evacuation centers in Benguet.https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic-groups-aid- philippines-in-wake-of-typhoon-mangkut-19687 Staff also focused on providing emergency shelter, hygiene kits, and cash transfers for those most in need.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/reader-center/how-to-help-typhoon- victims.html In partnership with Caritas Philippines, CRS heavily invested in disaster risk reduction and preparedness for communities in the country. =2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami= In late September 2018, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit Sulawesi, Indonesia, triggering a tsunami, which hit the city of Palu. Combined, the two events caused the deaths of more than 4,300 people and damaged more than 70,000 homes, leaving thousands of people homeless. The initial impact of the earthquake and tsunami caused the collapse of phone lines and damaged the local airport, making it more difficult for humanitarian organizations like CRS to respond immediately.https://www.bbc.com/news/world- asia-45704438https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/world/asia/tsunami-palu- indonesia-earthquake.html When CRS staff were able to safely reach hard hit areas of the country, together with Caritas Indonesia, they focused on suppling food, clean water, household items, and emergency shelter.https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/crs-helps-victims-of- indonesia-earthquake-and-tsunami-49240 More than 6,000 families were initially provided with these emergency kits. Part of CRS' response focused on providing cash assistance to local families, which not only allowed them to buy desperately needed essential items, but also supported local businesses during the crisis, allowing them to stay open and operational. =2017 Hurricane Maria= In September 2017, CRS responded to the devastating damage caused by Hurricane Maria, a Category 5 storm that hit several Caribbean islands, killing more than 3,000 people and causing more than US$91 billion in damage. Hurricane Maria, which hit the region less than two weeks after Hurricane Irma, made landfall on the island of Dominica with winds registered up to 160 mph. In the immediate aftermath, together with Caritas partners, CRS distributed 7,000 food and hygiene kits to families in Cuba, and more than 1,700 kits to families in the Dominican Republic. As the U.S. Catholic Church's international humanitarian agency, CRS focused on relief efforts in the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Antilles, while its sister agency, Catholic Charities, directed aid to those affected in the U.S. and its territories, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. =Others= CRS has also responded to the 2016 Ecuador earthquake, Hurricane Matthew, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. It also continues to respond to ongoing international crises including the Syrian refugee crisis and Central African Republic crisis. Awards and recognition * Villanova University: On May 18, 2008, the Rev. Peter Donahue, President of Villanova, conferred the degree of Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa on Ken Hackett for his work as President of Catholic Relief Services. Mr. Hackett was also selected to give the commencement address to the Class of 2008. * University of Notre Dame: On May 20, 2007, CRS President Ken Hackett received an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree and was among nine people recognized by Notre Dame in the fields of national and international politics, education, medicine, the arts, humanitarian work and the Catholic Church. * 2007 Aurora Award: CRS earned a Gold Award from the Independent Film and Video Competition for our \\"Water for Life\\" documentary video, which explores why more than 1 billion people do not have adequate access to clean water. * 2006 Pakistan Star of Sacrifice: On September 21, 2006, CRS was awarded the prestigious Sitara-i-Eisaar (Star of Sacrifice) honoring the agency's comprehensive and timely response to the devastating October 8, 2005 Pakistan earthquake. CRS was among the first agencies to respond, providing emergency supplies, shelter, education, water and sanitation materials, and livelihood support. * 2005 Caritas Flame of Hope Award: Catholic Charities saluted CRS' work around the world in bringing the very core of Christianity to millions suffering from natural disasters as well as human cruelty and injustice. * Knight Commander of Saint Gregory the Great: On October 31, 2004, CRS president Ken Hackett received the Knight Commander of Saint Gregory the Great medal, one of the highest papal honors. The ceremony took place in the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore, Maryland, and recognized Hackett's outstanding service to the papacy and the Archdiocese of Baltimore. * Millennium Challenge Corporation: On July 13, 2004, following the recommendation of Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, President George W. Bush nominated CRS President Ken Hackett to sit on the Millennium Challenge Corporation Board of Directors. Hackett was unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate. The Millennium Challenge Corporation is charged with improving the accountability and impact of foreign assistance.  Controversies  * In April 2008, theologian Germain Grisez, a critic of Pope Francis, noted that in 2007, Catholic Relief Services had established policy on its HIV related projects which included the provision of \\"full and accurate information\\" on condoms. CRS's position paper states that \\"CRS-supported projects should provide full and accurate, age-appropriate information about HIV prevention strategies including abstinence, fidelity and condoms in all of its HIV projects. However, these projects cannot purchase, distribute or promote condoms with funds obtained from CRS.\\" The policy paper also said that \\"All information provided about the use of condoms must be medically and scientifically accurate and include the public health benefits and failure rates of condom use.\\" * In the same article, Grisez said that CRS included a flipchart in its educational materials which promoted condom use. A cover- letter from CRS's Chief of Party, Jared M. Hoffman claims that \\"The comprehensive and accurate information on prevention contained in this material is consistent with CRS policy, and we are confident that the flipchart will be useful in all settings, requiring only minor adaptations to ensure cultural competence.‚Äù However, even though Hoffman claims that the flipchart is consistent with CRS policy, he also notes that \\"‚ÄúCRS has chosen not to include the CRS or AIDSRelief logo on the flipchart, due to the potential sensitivity of the information contained in these materials among Church partners.‚Äù Not only does the flipchart promote condom use as a means of preventing the transmission of HIV (in contradiction with Catholic moral teaching), but it also promotes artificial birth control, also in conflict with Catholic moral teaching. The flipchart says on page 132, \\"If the client and partner do not want to have a baby, explain that you can give them information about family planning choices.\\" * August 2, 2012, Red State noted that CRS is a dues-paying member of COREgroup, an organization that pushes contraception. * On August 14, Red State also said that CRS is a dues-paying member and on the executive committee of MEDiCAM, an organization that pushes contraception and abortion in Cambodia. In fact, a CRS regional director was a member of the planning committee for MEDiCAM when it created a policy paper for 2011 indicating the intention to train abortion-providers. * In 2013, American Life League proved that CRS provided $64 million to organizations distributing contraception, committing abortion, and performing sterilizations. * In January 2015, CRS was discovered to have been involved in the implementation in a Planned Parenthood style sex education program called \\"My Changing Body.\\" Even though CRS responded to the allegations, the response from CRS failed to address some of the more serious aspects of the claims. * In March 2015, Population Research Institute and the Lepanto Institute published a joint investigative report on CRS's PEPFAR-funded project in Kenya called \\"Support and Assistance to Indigenous Implementing Agencies (SAIDIA)\\". According to this report, not only did CRS implement a contraception-promoting program in Kenya called Healthy Choices II, but when confronted with this information, CRS's response was to collaborate with PEPFAR to have the public record altered so as to expunge any reference to Healthy Choices II under CRS's project. CRS immediately responded to the report, denying everything and questioning the methodology of the field investigator. However, documentation with CRS's letterhead obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show that CRS's denials are patently false. * Documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act noted that CRS implemented a condom-promoting program called Shuga. CRS responded to this allegation as well by confirming that \\"The SAIDIA FY2011 annual report to CDC correctly notes that the video was used as part of the abstinence and be faithful (AB) activities in FY2011, but stopped at the end of quarter three when CRS learned the materials were being used and were not appropriate for use within our programming.\\" However, CRS's claims to have protested against the use of Shuga are again contradicted by documents bearing CRS's letterhead which were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. According to these FOIA documents, CRS ended the Shuga program, not because it was morally objectionable, but because it was no longer implementing non-evidence based behavioral interventions. Shuga was discontinued along with at least seven other programs. In fact, in April 2012, CRS submitted to PEPFAR its continuation grant application for year five of the SAIDIA project. On page 342 of the FOIA documents is a very clear statement from CRS about how it is considering both Shuga I and II for year five of the SAIDIA project. CRS said in its grant application to PEPFAR, ‚ÄúSAIDIA is considering Shuga I and II to help address the gap particularly in ages 17-19 years. Shuga I and II addresses issues of multiple concurrent partnership, peer pressure, alcohol and substance use and status knowledge among youth.‚Äù Not only does this contradict CRS's claim that they ‚Äúinformed CDC that SAIDIA would not use this video within our abstinence and fidelity work,‚Äù but it calls into question its last line about continually reviewing and adjusting programs to ensure that they are in line with Catholic teaching. * In October 2016, the Lepanto Institute published a 58 page report detailing CRS's participation in the distribution of 2.25 million units of abortifacient contraception and condoms in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Accountability standards * 2011-2019 American Institute of Philanthropy: Catholic Relief Services has been named a top-rated charity and given the rating of A or higher by AIP for efficiently using the majority of funds toward programming versus fundraising. * 2011-2020 Better Business Bureau/Wise Giving Alliance: CRS was found to meet all 20 Standards for Charity Accountability, which take into account an organization's governance, financial accountability, truthfulness and transparency. The September 2017 audit found that only 3% of the CRS's expenses were for administration, leaving 2% for fundraising and 95% for program costs. * November 2011 Chronicle of Philanthropy: CRS was ranked 51st out of 400 charities in Chronicle of Philanthropy's Annual Top 400 Philanthropy List. * November 2011 NonProfit Times: CRS was ranked 23rd out of the 100 best charities reviewed by the publication. * 2012[CharityNavigator http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid;=5934#.VHSk3IvF8Tw] awarded CRS as 3 out of 4 stars for utilizing 93.3% of funds to program costs. * December 2019: CRS was named a Top-Rated Nonprofit by GreatNonprofits.https://greatnonprofits.org/org/catholic-relief-services See also *USCCB *Catholic Charities Notes Further reading *Egan, Eileen.

Transmissions began on 14 February 1922 from an ex-Army hut next to the Marconi laboratories at Writtle, near Chelmsford in Essex. Initially the station only had 200 watts and transmitted on 700m (428 kHz) on Tuesdays from 2000 to 2030. Two Emma Toc, in the spelling alphabet of the day, was a surprising success. The presenter, producer, actor-manager and writer was Captain P. P. Eckersley, a Marconi engineer. His regular announcement; \\"This is Two Emma Toc, Writtle testing, Writtle testing\\", became in short time quite well known. 2MT led to the creation of its sister station 2LO, and subsequently the BBC. 2MT did not itself become part of the BBC and closed down on 17 January 1923. Peter Eckersley went on to become the founding Chief Engineer at the British Broadcasting Company. The Marconi Hut site at Writtle is commemorated by a nearby information board at Melba Court ‚Äì named after Dame Nellie Melba who made Britain's first publicised entertainment broadcast from Marconi's New Street factory ‚Äì unveiled in 1997 by Marconi's daughter Princess Elettra Marconi. The site was sold off and the land used for housing development in the 1990s. A significant part of the original Writtle hut is now preserved at the Sandford Mill Museum of Science and Industry in North Chelmsford, where it forms part of a wireless and broadcasting historic exhibit.  G2MT in 1983  In 1983, the Marconi Company main site in Stanmore, Middlesex, found itself with an amateur radio club which applied for the call \\"2MT\\" to be issued. The UK authorities decided that they could not issue the call without the prefix \\"G\\" and so the Marconi Radio Society re- launched (G)2MT on the airwaves with many dignitaries present for the event. The call has been used from then until 2004 when the Stanmore site was closed and moved to Capability Green, Luton, Bedfordshire, under the BAE Systems banner and which is now Selex Galileo. The call \\"G2MT\\" is not as well used, as the modern building construction has severely limited the possibilities of having a permanent transmitting station. However, occasionally, one of the Marconi Radio Society members will bring along mobile transmitting equipment and give people the chance to hear (G)2MT over the air once again.  2MT in 2001  The 2MT call-sign has not been re-issued for regular use since 1922. However, in 2001, a special permit was given for it to be used to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first wireless transmission across the Atlantic by Marconi in 1901. Details of this event can be found on the Chelmsford Amateur Radio Society (CARS) website.  2MT in 2017  The 95th anniversary of 2MT was marked in February by amateur radio and internet special events by a team effort of CARS, EmmaTocEmmaToc.com and Chelmsford Museum Notes Category:Radio stations established in 1922 Category:Radio stations in Essex ","title":"2MT"},{"id":"2627557","title":"Laila Rouass"},{"id":"2627564","text":"John Pordage circa 1650s John Pordage (1607‚Äì1681) was an Anglican priest, astrologer, alchemist and Christian mystic. He founded the 17th-century English Behmenist group, which would later become known as the Philadelphian Society when it was led by his disciple and successor, Jane Leade. Early life John Pordage was the eldest son of Samuel Pordage (d. 1626), grocer, by his wife Elizabeth (Taylor), and was born in the parish of St. Dionis Backchurch, London, and baptised on 21 April 1607. He matriculated as a pensioner at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1623, and received his B.A. in 1626.Ariel Hessayon, \\"Pordage, John (bap. 1607, d. 1681,\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008) Religious Controversy and Medical Practice On 18 January 1633, Pordage married the widow Mary Freeman at St Gregory by St Paul's church, London.Hessayon, \\"Pordage\\" In London, Pordage soon attracted notoriety for his unusual religious conceptions. In 1634, it was reported that ‚ÄúOne Pordage broches new- fangled opinions concerning the signes, that No Man can trie himself by them, but was to stay by for an over-powring light.‚Äù In response, the famous puritan minister John Davenport reportedly ‚Äúpreacht against‚Äù Pordage, having ‚Äúmuch taken against his tenents.‚ÄùDavid R. Como, Blown by the Spirit: Puritanism and the Emergence of an Antinomian Underground in Pre‚ÄìCivil-War England (Stanford: Stanford University Press), 2004), 71 This was an early sign of the mysticism and heterodoxy that would later make Pordage infamous. Possibly, Pordage's opinions owed something to furtive influence of the , followers of the sectarian prophet Henry Nicholis (alias H. N.). In 1637, Pordage's brother-in- law, Henry Faldo, was accused of Familism.David R. Como, ‚ÄúThe Family of Love and the Making of English Revolutionary Religion: The Confession and ‚ÄòConversions‚Äô of Giles Creech,‚Äù The Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies, 48 (2018), 562‚Äì65 In the 1640s, Pordage would be described as one of those who had ‚Äútaught the doctrine of H. N.‚Äù in London.John Etherington, A Brief Discovery of the Blasphemous Doctrine of Familisme (London, 1645), 45. Despite allegations of heterodoxy, Pordage preached occasionally in London in the 1630s, acting as chaplain to Mary Lady Vere. He also reportedly preached at St Lawrence Jewry.Anthony √† Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, volume 2 (London, 1692), 450 Meanwhile, he began to act as an unlicensed medical physician, bringing him into conflict with the Royal College of Physicians. In 1639, he travelled to the Netherlands and obtained a medical degree from Leiden University, and later that year was incorporated M.D. at Cambridge. In 1640 and 1641, he was again in trouble with the Royal College for unlicensed medical activity and malpractice. Behmenists Pordage was curate in charge of St. Lawrence's, Reading, Berkshire, in 1644, the vicar being Thomas Gilbert (1613‚Äì1694). By 1647 (after 9 Nov 1646) he was rector of Bradfield, Berkshire, a living in the gift of Elias Ashmole, who thought highly of his astrological knowledge. Richard Baxter, who describes Pordage as chief of the 'Behmenists', or English followers of the German theologian Jakob B√∂hme, knew of him through a young man, probably Abiezer Coppe, who in 1649 was living under Pordage's roof in a 'family communion', the members 'aspiring after the highest spiritual state' through 'visible communion with angels'. Baxter thought they tried to carry too far 'the perfection of a monastical life'. Among themselves this family went by scripture names; Pordage was 'Father Abraham', his wife was 'Deborah'. He was eventually charged before the Committee for Plundered Ministers with heresies comprised in nine articles, accusing him of a sort of mystical pantheism. But on 27 March 1651, the committee acquitted him on all counts. On 18 September 1654, he was summoned to appear on 5 October before the county commissioners (known as 'expurgators') at the Bear Inn, Speenhamland, Berkshire. The nine articles were revived against him at the instance of John Tickel, a Presbyterian divine at Abingdon, Berkshire. The inquiry was successively adjourned several times, fresh articles being from time to time brought forward against him, to the number of fifty-six, in addition to the original nine. Most of them dealt with unsubstantial matters of personal gossip; the accusation of intercourse with spirits was pressed (from 19 October) by Christopher Fowler. It was made a charge against him that he had sheltered Robert Everard and Thomas Totney. One of his maid-servants, while attesting some of the stories about spirits, bore witness to the purity and piety of the family life. By 30 November, Pordage was too ill to appear; the inquiry was adjourned to 7 December at the Bear Inn, Reading, Berkshire. On 8 December the commissioners ejected him as 'ignorant and very insufficient for the work of the ministry'. He was to leave the rectory by 2 February and clear out his barns by 25 March 1655. Subsequent to the trial he published a pamphlet, Innocencie Appearing, in which he gave his account of the proceedings, and included a document, not presented at court, in which he confessed to frequent conversations with angels. These were probably summoned by magical means.John Pordage, Innocencie Appearing (London, 1655); Joad Raymond, Milton's Angels: The Early-Modern Imagination (Oxford, 2010), ch. 5. Reinstatement At the Restoration Pordage was reinstated. In 1663, he became acquainted with Jane Leade, and assisted her in the study of Jakob B√∂hme. In August 1673 or 1674 (there is a doubt about the year), Pordage and Mrs. Leade 'first agreed to wait together in prayer and pure dedication'. Francis Lee, Jane Leade's son-in-law, speaks of Pordage's devoutness and sincerity, maintaining that 'his conversation was such as malice itself can hardly except against'. He was not, however, a man of robust intellect; his insight into B√∂hme's writings was feeble, and his theosophy was of the emotional order. In his will, he describes himself as 'doctor in physick.' It does not appear that he held the degree of MD, though it was assigned to him by others, and he was commonly called Dr Pordage. He died in 1681, and was buried in St Andrew's, Holborn, on 11 December. His will, made on 28 November 1681, and proved 17 January 1682, was witnessed by Jane Leade. His portrait was engraved by William Faithorne. His first wife Mary (Lane), of Tenbury, Worcestershire, was buried at Bradfield on 25 August 1668. His second wife was Elizabeth, widow of Thomas Faldo of London. His son Samuel Pordage was a writer and poet; he had other sons: John, William, and Benjamin. His daughter Elizabeth was buried at Bradfield on 23 December 1663; other daughters were Mary, Sarah (married in Stisted), and Abigail. His brother Francis, who survived him, was rector of Stanford Dingley, Berkshire. In Theologia Mystica, Pordage describes a spiritual journey through the Boehmean cosmology of the three worlds of the \\"Dark-Fire\\" or wrath-world, the \\"Fire-Light\\" or severe world of common human experience, and the \\"Light-Fire World\\" or paradise.

Rules Slitherlink is played on a rectangular lattice of dots. Some of the squares formed by the dots have numbers inside them. The objective is to connect horizontally and vertically adjacent dots so that the lines form a simple loop with no loose ends. In addition, the number inside a square represents how many of its four sides are segments in the loop. Other types of planar graphs can be used in lieu of the standard grid, with varying numbers of edges per vertex or vertices per polygon. These patterns include snowflake, Penrose, Laves and Altair tilings. These add complexity by varying the number of possible paths from an intersection, and/or the number of sides to each polygon; but similar rules apply to their solution. Solution methods =Notation= Whenever the number of lines around a cell matches the number in the cell, the other potential lines must be eliminated. This is usually indicated by marking an X on lines known to be empty. Another useful notation when solving Slitherlink is a ninety degree arc between two adjacent lines, to indicate that exactly one of the two must be filled. A related notation is a double arc between adjacent lines, indicating that both or neither of the two must be filled. These notations are not necessary to the solution, but can be helpful in deriving it. Arc notation around a 2 in a corner. Many of the methods below can be broken down into two simpler steps by use of arc notation. =Exactly 2 or 0 lines at each point= A key to many deductions in Slitherlink is that every point has either exactly two lines connected to it, or no lines. So if a point which is in the centre of the grid, not at an edge or corner, has three incoming lines which are X'd out, the fourth must also be X'd out. This is because the point cannot have just one line - it has no exit route from that point. Similarly, if a point on the edge of the grid, not at a corner, has two incoming lines which are X'd out, the third must also be X'd out. And if a corner of the grid has one incoming line which is X'd out, the other must also be X'd out. Application of this simple rule leads to increasingly complex deductions. Recognition of these simple patterns will help greatly in solving Slitherlink puzzles. Corners * If a 1 is in a corner, the actual corner's lines may be X'd out, because a line that entered said corner could not leave it except by passing by the 1 again. This also applies if two lines leading into the 1-box at the same corner are X'd out. A 1 in a corner. * If a 3 is in a corner, the two outside edges of that box can be filled in because otherwise the rule above would have to be broken. A 3 in a corner. * If a 2 is in a corner, two lines must be going away from the 2 at the border. A 2 in a corner. Rules for squares with 1 * If a line comes into a corner of a 1 and if one of the three remaining directions that the line can continue, the one that is not a side of the 1 is a known blank, then the two sides of the 1 opposite that corner can be X'd out. A 1 next to a line. * This also applies in reverse. That is, if a line comes into the corner of a 1, and the two opposite edges of the 1 are already X'd out, the line cannot go away from the 1 since that would put Xs around all sides of the 1. A 1 next to a line (opposite) * If two 1s are diagonally adjacent, then of the eight segments around those two cells, either the \\"inner\\" set of four segments sharing a common endpoint (the point shared by the 1s) or the other \\"outer\\" set of four segments must all be X'd out. Thus if any two inner or outer segments in one 1 are X'd, the respective inner or outer segments of the other 1 must also be X'd. Diagonally adjacent 1s Diagonally adjacent 1s * If two 1s are adjacent along the edge of the grid, the line between them can be X'd out, because there would be no direction for it to continue when it reached the edge. A rule for squares with 2 If a 2 has any surrounding line X‚Äôd, then a line coming into either of the two corners not adjacent to the X‚Äôd out line cannot immediately exit at right angles away from the 2, as then two lines around the 2 would be impossible, and can therefore be X‚Äôd. This means that the incoming line must continue on one side of the 2 or the other. This in turn means that the second line of the 2 must be on the only remaining free side, adjacent to the originally X‚Äôd line, so that can be filled in. Conversely, if a 2 has a line on one side, and an adjacent X‚Äôd out line, then the second line must be in one of the two remaining sides, and exit from the opposite corner (in either direction). If either of those two exits is X‚Äôd out, then it must take the other route. A 2 next to a line. Rules for squares with 3 * If a 3 is adjacent to a 0, either horizontally or vertically, then all edges of that 3 can be filled except for the one touching the 0. In addition, the two lines perpendicular to the adjacent boxes can be filled. A 3 adjacent to an 0. * If two 3s are adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically, their common edge must be filled in, because the only other option is a closed oval that is impossible to connect to any other line. Second, the two outer lines of the group (parallel to the common line) must be filled in. Thirdly, the line through the 3s will always wrap around in an \\"S\\" shape. Therefore, the line between the 3s cannot continue in a straight line, and those sides which are in a straight line from the middle line can be X'd out. Two adjacent 3s. * If a 3 is adjacent to a 0 diagonally, both sides of the 3 that meet the 0's corner must be filled. This is because if either of those sides were open, the line ending in the corner of the 0 would have no place to go. This is similar to the 3-in-a-corner rule. 3 diagonally next to 0. * Similarly, if a 3 has a corner with Xs in both directions going away from that corner, then both sides of the 3 that meet that corner must be filled. This is because if one of those two sides of the 3 were open, the other would have to be filled (because the 3 can only have one open side) but would meet 3 Xs at that corner, which is impossible because each point on the grid must have exactly 2 or 0 lines. * If a line reaches a corner of a 3, there must be lines on both sides of the 3 that said corner is not adjacent to, because if the 3's sole empty space were not adjacent to it, the corner would have three lines connected to it. Furthermore, the segment leading away from the 3 at the corner reached by the line must be empty; if it were filled, neither of the remaining 2 undetermined sides of the 3 would be able to contain a line. A 3 next to a line. Diagonals of 3s and 2s * If two 3s are adjacent diagonally, the edges which do not run into the common point must be filled in. Two diagonal 3s. * Similarly, if two 3s are in the same diagonal, but separated by any number of 2s (and only 2s) the outside edges of the 3s must be filled in, just as if they were adjacent diagonally. Diagonal 3s with 2 between them. * If there is a series of 2s in a diagonal line and an angled line meets the corner of the 2 at one end of the series, a matching angled line can be drawn all the way up the series. One or more diagonal 2s terminated by two filled lines pointing into them. * If a line reaches the starting point (A) of a diagonal that contains one or more 2s and ends with a 3, both sides of the far corner (farthest from A on the diagonal) of the 3 must be filled. If this were not true, it would imply that both sides of the near corner of the 3 must be filled, which would imply that the near corners of all the 2s must be filled, including the 2 at the start of the diagonal, which is impossible because it conflicts with the line that has reached the starting point (A). A diagonal of 2s ending with a 3. Diagonals of a 3 and 1 * If a 1 and a 3 are adjacent diagonally and the outer two sides of the 1 are X'd out, then the outer two sides of the 3 must be filled in. Diagonals of a 3 and 1 * The opposite is the same: if the outer two corners of the 3 are filled in, then the outer two corners of the 1 must be X'd out. Diagonals of a 3 and 1 opposite Diagonals starting with a 2 * If a line reaches a corner of a 2, and the line must continue through one of the two connecting sides of the 2, then exactly one of the other two sides of the 2 must be filled, and that line must continue through one of the two connecting sides of the diagonally adjacent square. center center =A rule for closed regions= If a region of the lattice is closed-off (such that no lines can \\"escape\\"), and is not empty, there must be a non-zero, even number of lines entering the region that begin outside the region. (An odd number of lines entering implies an odd number of segment ends inside the region, which makes it impossible for all the segment ends to connect. If there are no such lines, the lines inside the region cannot connect with the lines outside, making a solution impossible.) Often, this rule will eliminate one or more otherwise feasible options. In the figure below, the line at the top-left will close off the top- right region of the lattice whether it proceeds down or to the right. The line to the right (around two sides of the 3) has entered the closed region. To satisfy the rule, the first line must enter the region, and the second line must not enter the region a second time. (Since the boundary of any closed region also closes off the remainder of the puzzle, the rule can also be applied to the larger, bottom-left region. To apply the rule, it is only necessary to count the lines crossing the boundary.) center =Jordan curve theorem= In an exceptionally difficult puzzle, one may use the Jordan curve theorem, which states that any open curve that starts and ends outside of a closed curve must intersect the closed curve an even number of times. In particular, this means that any row of the grid must have an even number of vertical lines and any column must have an even number of horizontal lines. When only one potential line segment in one of these groups is unknown, you can determine whether it is part of the loop or not with this theorem. A simple strategy to assist in using this theorem is to \\"paint\\" (sometimes called \\"shade\\") the outside and the inside areas. When you see two outside cells, or two inside cells next to each other, then you know that there is not a line between them. The converse is also true: if you know there is no line between two cells, then those cells must be the same \\"color\\" (both inside or both outside). Similarly, if an outside cell and an inside cell are adjacent, you know there must be a filled line between them; and again the converse is true. =Rules for puzzles that have only 1 solution= * If there are exactly two possible paths, A and B, between two points in the solution (two points that have been, or must be, reached by lines); and if a solution containing A must also work with B, and the reverse is not true; then B is the correct path, and the solution must pass through a point contained in A but not B. In the figure below, if a solution could pass through the top and right sides of the 2, then there must be another solution which is exactly the same except that it passes through the bottom and left sides of the 2, because the squares to the top and right of the 2 are unconstrained (do not contain numbers). Also, the solution must pass through the top-right corner of the 2, otherwise there must be another solution which is exactly the same except that it passes through the top and right sides of the 2. center If there is a 2 in a corner, and the two non-diagonally adjacent squares are unconstrained, lines can be drawn as shown below. (In the figure, the question mark represents any number or blank, but the number will only be a 2 or 3. A puzzle with only one solution cannot have a 2 in a corner with two non-diagonally adjacent, unconstrained squares, and a diagonally adjacent 0 or 1.) center * If there are two paths between two points, such that a solution containing one must also work with the other, then both paths can be ruled out. In the figure below, the circled points can be connected by a line directly between them, and also by a line that traverses the other three sides of the square that extends to the left of the points. It should be clear (with the red line ignored) that for both paths the remainder of the solution can be the same ‚Äì since the constraints for the remainder of the solution are the same ‚Äì so both paths are ruled out. center History Slitherlink is an original puzzle of Nikoli; it first appeared in Puzzle Communication Nikoli #26 (June 1989). The editor combined two original puzzles contributed there. At first, every square contained a number and the edges did not have to form a loop.

She sang on the hit single \\"Ain't No Love (Ain't No Use)\\" alongside the Manchester-based electronic group Sub Sub. Career Williams was a friend of Sub Sub at the time, and the band, searching for a female guest vocalist, featured her vocals. This helped expose her talents to the public, and was followed by further critical success. Williams and her writing colleague Eric Gooden, found Square One Studios in Bury, Greater Manchester. The proprietor Trevor Taylor, liked what he heard and they began recording a string of tracks assisted by house engineer and musician Stephen Boyce-Buckley. They released the single \\"Showdown\\" under the name No Sovereign on Geffen Records in 1987, and subsequently landed a recording contract with 10 Records; a sub-division of Virgin Records. They released a self-titled album as the duo Temper Temper in 1991. Williams launched a solo career in 1994 as a soul/dance singer, signed to Columbia Records. Her debut solo single, \\"All Cried Out!\\" peaked at No. 60 on the UK Singles Chart. The follow-up, \\"Everyday Thang\\", did better, hitting the UK top 40, peaking at No. 38. Her next single, the ballad \\"Not Enough?\\" managed a No. 65 chart placing. Her debut album, Human Cradle, failed to reach the UK Albums Chart. Williams has also featured on the Adrian Snell album, Father, in which she read Psalm 139. Early in 1995, Williams returned to the UK top 40 with a cover of \\"You Are Everything\\" (a duet with Joe Roberts). The song reached No. 28.

Early life and education Their father, Smith Kinmont Seth, was the son of a farmer from Fife and a bank clerk in the head office of the Commercial Bank of Scotland. Their mother, Margaret, was the daughter of Andrew Little a farmer from Berwickshire. An elder brother died in infancy. Seth was educated at High School and the University of Edinburgh. In 1878 he was awarded a Hibbert Travelling Fellowship. He spent two years abroad, chiefly at German universities. On his return in 1880 he was appointed assistant to Professor Campbell Fraser, Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at Edinburgh. He became Balfour Lecturer in Philosophy in 1883. From 1883‚Äì87 he was Professor of Logic and Philosophy at the newly created University College of Cardiff. He returned to Scotland in 1887 when he was appointed Professor of Logic, Rhetoric and Metaphysics at St Andrews (1887‚Äì91). He was Gifford Lecturer, University of Aberdeen, 1911‚Äì13, Hibbert Lecturer (1921) and Gifford Lecturer, University of Edinburgh (1921‚Äì23).Who Was Who, III, 1929‚Äì40, A. & C. Black, London, 1967, p.1217 Pringle-Pattison received the degree Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) honoris causa from the University of Durham in June 1902. Personal life In 1884 he married Eva (d. 1928), daughter of Albrecht Stropp. The couple had two daughters and three sonsWho Was Who, III, 1929‚Äì40, A. & C. Black, London, 1967, p.1217 He is buried with his wife and family in Morningside Cemetery, Edinburgh against the south wall towards the south-west. Philosophical work Seth's twin enemies were English Empiricism and the Anglo variant of Hegelianism. According to Seth, both manner of philosophy degraded the independence of the individual. \\"Each self,\\" he wrote in Hegelianism and Personality, \\"is a unique existence, which is perfectly impervious ... to other selves ‚Äì impervious in a fashion of which the impenetrability of matter is a faint analogue.\\" Seth's comments here stand in stark contrast to the British and American Hegelianism of the turn of the 20th century. Seth was a personal idealist and was critical of Absolute idealism, according to Seth personality should not be merged into the Absolute.David Boucher. The Scottish idealists: selected philosophical writings. 2004, p. 75-77 Seth's views have also been described as panentheistic.John W. Cooper. Panentheism, the other God of the philosophers: from Plato to the present. 2006, p. 133 It was F. H. Bradley's and Josiah Royce's primary contention that the Self is permeable to all manner of imitation, and that the self as Seth describes is a harmful fiction. At the heart of Seth's analysis was a defence of the necessity of anthropomorphism, John Ruskin's \\"pathetic fallacy.\\" \\"We are anthropomorphic,\\" he affirmed, \\"and necessarily so, to the inmost fibre of our thinking.\\" He continues: \\"Every category ... every description of existence or relation, is necessarily a transcript from our own nature and our own experience. Into some of our conceptions we put more, into others less, of ourselves; but all modes of existence and forms of action are necessarily construed by us in terms of our own life. Everything, down to the atom, is constructed upon the scheme of the conscious self, with its multiplicity of states and its central interpenetrating unity. We cannot rid our thought of its inevitable presupposition.\\"Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison. Hegelianism and personality. W. Blackwood and sons, 1893, p. 103 Personality, the true a priori, stands walled off against external phenomenon either in terms of the Absolute, or from the influx of sensation. Seth's defence of personality had a dramatic effect on later, anti-Hegelian and pluralist, thinkers in the United States in particular. William James, George Santayana, Bertrand Russell and George Herbert Mead, all borrowed his concept of the personality, or psyche, and sought it as a barrier against the claims of Gabriel Tarde, F. H. Bradley, and Josiah Royce.

He was openly gay and focused on homophobia in the public and voluntary sectors, particularly in the education system. Early life Patrick attended South Shields Grammar School but moved to Burnley at the age of fifteen and attended Burnley Grammar before going to Phillipa Fawcett College, London (a college of the University of London) where he studied English and drama. Career He came out in 1969 and went on to become a teacher in 1972 at the Roger Manwood School, Lewisham. He became Head of Drama and a member of the teachers‚Äô advisory panel for Greenwich Young People's Theatre in Education Company and worked with the teachers and advisors who produced the Inner London Education Authority‚Äôs \\"Drama Bulletin.\\" In 1976, he co-founded the Lewisham Association for Multicultural Education. In 1983, he became the Equal opportunities Officer for the school he had just helped into amalgamation as a member of the Crofton School Advisory Team. While continuing to teach English and Drama, he became the co-ordinator for a project bringing adults with learning disabilities into the school to use the facilities and work with pupils. This work was recognised by the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) who appointed him an advisor for equal opportunities in the areas of Expressive Arts, particularly Drama & Theatre Studies, PHSE and the pastoral curriculum. Soon he was co- opted to the Relationships and Sexuality Project and was a member of its steering group, became the Multi-ethnic Inspectorate representative on the Authority's P.H.S.E. Advisory panel, a member of the Authority's video panel. He also worked with the ILEA publishing section to produce materials, videos and guidelines for teachers. This was until the abolition of the ILEA in 1990 when he returned to teaching English and Drama at Crofton School. In May 1996, he took some time out to concentrate on writing and his training work and co- founded Chrysalis, a training collective with his close friend and colleague, Sue Sanders. In 1997 he joined the staff of Accrington and Rossendale College, working first in their Student Services Department and later moving on to full-time lectureship. In September 1999 he joined their Performing Arts Team to work full-time teaching BTEC Foundation, BTEC National and HND Performing Arts. He also directed several plays including an education piece on homophobic bullying which toured local schools and was performed at teachers‚Äô conferences. He then moved to Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School where he taught for three years, leaving after a period of illness. He also worked as a consultant to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. In 2006 he taught at Ribblesdale High School Clitheroe where he used to teach drama. In 2007 he founded the Rossendale Players Youth Theatre at the Millennium Theatre in Waterfoot, Rossendale. Activism In 1974, Paul Patrick co-founded the Gay Teachers‚Äô Group, and was its secretary until 1982. He was the first teacher in the UK to come out to parents and pupils and retain their job, and went on to be promoted. He then became the first single gay man to be allowed to foster a young heterosexual man, Roger Waters, one of his pupils. In his work, he addressed the International Conference of Teachers of English, been the UK representative at an international conference held in Finland on the development of lesbian and gay issues in the curriculum, and been a member of the National Union of Teachers. In 2002 he became the Co-chair of Schools Out together with Sue Sanders. He also became the Equal Opportunities Officer of the National Union of Teachers - Lancashire Division and a member of the NUT's LGBT Working Party. Since 2004, he was a member of the Steering Group of LGBT History Month (UK) for which, together with a team of teachers, he created and vetted lessons and assembly suggestions. He also toured the country promoting LGBT History Month to a wide range of groups and organisations. Public appearances As well as being a teacher, Paul Patrick wrote on a range of issues and sub-edited others' work. His articles were published in many prestigious publications including Gay News, The Guardian, The Times Educational Supplement, The Teacher, the Open University, Tretham Books and Multilingual Matters . He also worked on several educational video programmes. He regularly appeared in the national press, on TV and radio programmes dealing with education, social equality and LGBT issues and fulfilled many public speaking engagements. He lectured on PGCE and M Ed courses at Goldsmiths College and the Institute of Education. In May 2002, he nominated himself to appear in the list being compiled by The Guardian of the people who have done most to shape Britain during the Queen's reign. His reasons for it being that he too, [had] been a queen for 50 years, although under somewhat less privileged circumstances. As Britain's first openly gay teacher not to be fired or moved to a 'safe' position and as a campaigner for lesbian, gay and bisexual equality for more than 30 years, I feel I have contributed a lot more to Britain than that other Queen has. I am also more attractive and a lot more fun! Death Paul Patrick died on 22 May 2008, aged 57, after a long battle with a chronic lung condition. He was working on Biting the hand that feeds me!, his autobiography.

In fact, he wrote the song many months prior to the incident, and subsequently began dedicating the song to him. On the topic of dedication, Wylde explains that he \\"was looking at the lyrics, and I just said 'Man, this has gotta be Dime's tune', so we just made it Dime's song and that's how the video came about. I think it's really emotional and it came out great. Everyone loves it - Vinnie Paul Abbott (Darrell's brother), Rita (Darrell's girlfriend).

The system is named after John McEnroe, who was infamous for contesting umpire calls. CBS was the first network to use the MacCam widely, as John McEnroe was one of their tennis analysts. History The MacCam was used at the 2004 U.S. Open to demonstrate several poor calls by chair umpires. In Serena Williams' controversial quarterfinal loss to Jennifer Capriati, several poor calls were contested by Williams. Television replays demonstrated that there were actually several crucial calls that were obviously erroneous. Following this match, the chair umpire Mariana Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this however was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/09/sports/tennis/williams-receives- apology-and-umpires-open-is-over.html A major limitation of the MacCAM was that it could only evaluate the baseline‚Äînot sidelines or service line calls.

It is located northeast of Swansea city centre. The population in 2011 was 7,503.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000565 Welsh is the first language of 24 per cent of the population and both Welsh and English language schools are available. The village lies close to the M4 motorway which can be accessed via the bypass or old road via Ynystawe. The community includes part of the village of Glais. History Around 1878 Clydach was a very small community if it could at all have been called that. Maps from this date show Clydach to consist of sub-areas namely 'Mount Pleasant' (the area by high street shops), 'Faerdre' (covering the area nearest to Vardre Road), 'Down' the area that was once 'Down Farm' which is now land laying behind the Farmer's Arms, Clydach and below 'Ty gwyn Road'. There was also an area called Ty Gwyn as Ty Gwyn/White House was present on the land. The road leading to Ty Gwyn is now Ty Gwyn Road and also 'Coed Cae-Du' near Craig Cefn Parc. The map of c. 1878 Clydach (which can be viewed at the Archive Service at Swansea Civic CentreWest Glamorgan Archives Service) shows that number 1 St John's Road was originally the old 'St John's School for Girls, Boys and Infants', which was linked to St John's Church near the shops at Capel Buildings near the Mond. A second school is shown where the current building of Clydach Infants stands which is also for girls/boys and infants. On a map dated 1899 Clydach has grown substantially to have a larger community base with the school on Twyn-y-Bedw Road being expended upon and a 2nd school being built just a little farther up the same street. The St John's School was by this point being used as a Sunday school and not for general education. There was a Clydach woollen factory not far from the schools on a road named 'Prince Llewellyn Street' or as it is now known 'Factory Road'. St Mary's Church is not on this map and is shown as a blank open space. In 1918 the Sunday school is still showing on the map under the area name of Vardre close to Mount Pleasant and Graig Felin was known as Aber-Clydach. The top of Clydach near Lone Road and Bryn Mair was named Upper Forge not yet having its slang title of 'Sunny Bank' with the locals. Note: Sunny Bank does not appear by name on any maps seen to date (June 2012). In the early 19th century, Clydach was a small village in the Swansea Valley. As the coal in the South Wales Valleys was a valuable commodity during the Industrial Revolution, Clydach experienced growth as a through road for transporting goods between Swansea and the many mines and heavy metal industries. The 16-mile (26 km) long Swansea Canal was built through the centre of Clydach between 1794 and 1798. It was constructed to transport up to 400,000 tonnes of coal a year from Ystalyfera to Swansea port. The canal remained profitable until 1902, when losses were first reported. This decline in revenue and profits was largely due to the competition from its rival the Swansea Vale Railway. The last commercial cargo carried on the Swansea Canal was in 1931 when coal was conveyed from Clydach to Swansea. Boats continued to operate on the canal after that date but only for maintenance work, with horse-drawn boats last recorded in Clydach in 1958. Only of the canal's original length of remain. Population The end of the 19th century and the early 20th century saw a significant growth in the village's population. With the opening of the Mond in 1902 the village experienced significant growth as the factory became the main employer within the village. The figures below show the population for the parish of Rhyndwyglydach. { border=\\"1\\" !

The village's population was approximately 7,500 on 23 February 2010 and a population of 10,830 on 28 July 2011. The population of Clydach, Glamorgan, Wales, UK on 6 May 2012 is approximately 12,593. Health care The town benefited from Clydach War Memorial Hospital until it closed in 2015. Retail =High Street= The centre of Clydach High Street, the main commercial area of the town has had major investments in improving its facilities. These include reshaping and resurfacing of the road, new flagstones to replace tarmac pavements, new trees, new seats and cycle racks. Work was commissioned by Cwmni Clydach Development Trust, with funding for the schemes provided by the Welsh Development Agency and Swansea City Council. A grant of over ¬£130,000 was made available for local high street businesses to improve the frontage to their stores. Industry =Clydach refinery= Clydach refinery, known as 'the Mond', was built by Ludwig Mond the inventor of the nickel carbonyl process at the turn of the 20th century. It started production in 1902. It is Europe‚Äôs largest nickel refinery. It is 100% owned by Vale and produces nickel powder, nickel pellets and other various nickel-coated materials. It also has a nickel foam production plant that until recently was the sole provider of the nickel foam required in the power cells of the Toyota Prius; production has since moved to a plant in China. The plant was the heart of the village and one of the largest employers in the Swansea Valley for many years. By 1910 over 40% of the village's population worked in the refinery. Today, with improvements in processing and a rationalisation of products, the refinery now employs just over 240 people, equating to 3% of the village's population. The refinery has been progressive in ensuring the reduction of emissions and pollutants. The River Tawe, which runs alongside the refinery, is once again home to breeding salmon and trout. The refinery is, however, a top-tier Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations (COMAH) site, due to the inherent nature of its process. Religion St Mary's Church There are a number of churches and chapels in Clydach, serving both English and Welsh language speakers. Clydach is a parish of the Church in Wales, the parish church being St. Mary's on High Street. Other English language churches include Lighthouse Church (Assemblies of God), Bethel Evangelical Church, and St. Benedicts (Roman Catholic). Two Welsh language chapels remain in Clydach: Calfaria (Welsh Baptist) and Capel y Nant (Welsh Independents). accessed 17 June 2015 Capel y Nant was formed in 2008 and meets at the former Carmel Chapel. The church was created through the uniting of Hebron and Carmel Independent Chapels. Capel y Nant also welcomes members of Salem Fardre Presbyterian Church, and is in partnership with Clydach English language Methodist Church. A number of Welsh-speaking churches/chapels in the community have recently closed, though their buildings still remain. These include St. John's (High Street), Hebron (Hebron Road) which is now being converted into a dwelling house by a local resident, whose family have lived in the village for the past 100 years. Also in Clydach is Bethania English Baptist Church, Graig-felin. The Reverend Valentine Evans, who wrote the History of Clydach at the beginning of the 20th century, is buried in its cemetery. A Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses located on Capel Road is one of the oldest in Wales.  Notable people  *Abiah Roderick (1898 - 1978), . *Sir Ludwig Mond (7 March 1839 ‚Äì 11 December 1907) Leisure and learning =Mond Valley Golf Club= Originally a nine-hole course (dating back to the 1960s) that was intended to be a resource exclusively for INCO (Clydach Refinery) employees, the course now welcomes golfers of all ages and abilities throughout the year. The club is nestled in the historic Swansea Valley bordered on one side by the River Tawe and by the Swansea Canal. It was renamed Mond Valley Golf Club in May 2012 after Vale Europe outsourced the management. =Forge Fach Community Resource Centre= Following the demolition of the old Clydach swimming pool, the Cwmni Clydach Development Trust, commissioned a new multi purpose community resource centre at Forge Fach, at a cost of approximately ¬£1.8 million, funded by the Welsh Assembly Government, City & County of Swansea & Clydach Community Council. Forge Fach is situated next to the Forge Fach Waterfalls, part of the Lower Clydach River, which runs into the Tawe River and gave Clydach its original name, Clydach-on-Tawe. Clydach is the equivalent of the Irish word Cladaugh, meaning sandy bend/strand. The centre opened in 2006. It provides a range of facilities including a community caf√©, a full day care nursery (Forge Fach Day Nursery), a multi-purpose hall, ICT suite, training & conferencing facilities plus an external multi-use games area. In addition there are a number of fully serviced offices rented by local businesses. The City & County of Swansea's Lifelong Learning department & Swansea University's Dept of Adult Continuing Education use the centre to run a number of adult education classes . In 2011 the City & County of Swansea opened the 'Waterfall View' day service at Forge Fach. In 2013, Cwmni Clydach Development Trust went into administration, leaving the future of Forge Fach uncertain. Swansea Council has assumed temporary control of the facility. A local campaign group called for Forge Fach to be turned into a health, leisure, wellbeing and swimming centre. In October 2015, the resource centre was taken over by Walsingham Support, a national disability charity, supporting adults with learning disabilities, brain injury and complex health needs. =Dynamic Rock= 2006 saw the opening of the Old Public Hall, which was converted into an indoor climbing centre and was renamed 'Dynamic Rock'. It is now home to the Swansea Indoor Climbing Centre. The walls are 12m high and feature overhangs, slabs, pillars, ar√™tes and arches. =Cwm Clydach= The Cwm Clydach RSPB Reserve is situated on the outskirts of the village, en route to Craig Cefn Park near the New Inn pub. The Cwm Clydach nature reserve used to be the home to the Nixon and Bell Drift mine. It was affectionately known as Nixon's and was one of the main employers until 1960‚Äì1961. It was used after as a pumping station. The colliery was a rock top colliery and there was even a steam boiler underground, which was rare in a colliery. Little remains of the colliery now, and there is a walk up the valley past other remnants of other NCB and private mines. =Cycling= Clydach is served by National Cycle Route 43. Major work has recently been undertaken on part of the cycle route between Clydach and Glais. The lottery- funded Sustrans laid a new tarmac path for pedestrians and cyclists, which begins alongside the River Tawe, behind the Vardre Rugby Club, and ends at Station Road in Glais. The tarmac path was mainly built on space used by abandoned railway tracks. =Education= Clydach Primary school and Graigfelen Primary schools are the main primary schools for residents. There is also a Welsh medium primary school, Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Gellionnen, on Gellionnen Road, and a Roman Catholic primary school, St Joseph's, on Pontardawe Road. As of September 2012, Clydach Infants and Clydach Juniors are now one school (Clydach Primary School). The village used to be home to Cwmtawe Lower Comprehensive School. It was the junior part of a three-school system, the other partners being Gwaen-Cae-Gurwen Lower School and Cwmtawe Upper School in Pontardawe. The lower schools were for 11- to 13-year-olds while the last three years of compulsory education were provided in Pontardawe. Today Clydach is in the catchment area of Birchgrove Comprehensive School. However, many students from Clydach attend Cwmtawe Community School in Pontardawe. =Sport= Football A number of football teams ‚Äì including FC Clydach, Inco, Clydach Sports, and Sunnybank WMC ‚Äì play in Clydach, all of them as members of the Neath & District League. Rugby Vardre Rugby Football Club is a sporting venue in Clydach and Clydach's younger residents train out on the pitches behind the building over the canal. They have 1st, 2nd, and junior teams.

Located on the border between India and Bangladesh, with most of its ruins on the Indian side and a few structures on the Bangladeshi side, it was once one of the most populous cities in the world. The ruins of this former city now straddle the international border and are divided between the Malda district of West Bengal and Chapai Nawabganj District of Rajshahi Division. The Kotwali Gate, formerly part of the citadel, now marks the border checkpoint between the two countries. Gauda was the capital city of Bengal under several kingdoms. The Gauda region was also a province of several pan- Indian empires. During the 7th century, the Gauda Kingdom was founded by King Shashanka, whose reign corresponds with the beginning of the Bengali calendar. The Pala Empire was founded in Gauda during the 8th century. The empire ruled large parts of the northern Indian subcontinent. Gauda became known as Lakhnauti during the Sena dynasty. Gauda gradually became synonymous with Bengal and Bengalis. It was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate in 1204. For 115 years between 1450 and 1565, Gauda was the capital of the Bengal Sultanate. In 1500, Gauda was the fifth-most populous city in the world, with a population of 200,000.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMs5xapBewM&t;=5shttps://scroll.in/article/917929/medieval- cities-in-gujarat-were-once-the-biggest-in-the-world-their-culture-deeply- influential The Portuguese left detailed accounts of the city. The Sultans built a citadel, many mosques, a royal palace, canals and bridges. Buildings featured glazed tiles. It became one of the most densely populated cities in the Indian subcontinent. The city thrived until the collapse of the Bengal Sultanate in the 16th-century when the Mughal Empire took control of the region. When the Mughal Emperor Humayun invaded the region, he renamed the city as Jannatabad (heavenly city). Most of the surviving structures in Gauda are from the period of the Bengal Sultanate. The city was sacked by Sher Shah Suri. An outbreak of the plague contributed to the city's downfall. The course of the Ganges River was located near the city. A change in the course of the Ganges caused Gauda to lose its strategic importance. A new Mughal capital developed later in Dhaka. Gauda was one of the prominent capitals in the history of Bengal and the history of the Indian subcontinent. It was a center of stately medieval architecture. Gauda's ruins were depicted in the artwork of European painters during the 18th and 19th centuries. Colonial officials, such as Francis Buchanan-Hamilton and William Francklin, left detailed surveys of the former Bengali capital.https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and- culture/once-upon-a-fort-gaurs-firoz-minar-is-still-an-imposing- sight/article26407049.ece  History  =Kingdom of Gauda= After the fall of the Gupta Empire, western Bengal was ruled by the Gauda Kingdom and eastern Bengal by the Samatata Kingdom. Gauda was founded by Shashanka, one of the pioneering Bengali kings in history.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shashanka Shashanka's reign falls approximately between 590 and 625. The origin of the Bengali calendar falls within the reign of Shashanka. =Pala Empire= The Pala Empire The Pala Empire was founded in Gauda region during the rise of Gopala as king with the approval of an assembly of chieftains. The Pala Emperors carried the title Lord of Gauda. The empire ruled for four centuries and its territory included large parts of northern India. According to historian D. C. Sicar, the term Gauda is an appropriate name for the Pala Empire itself. The Pala period saw the development of the Bengali language, script and other aspects of Bengali culture. Indeed, the term Gaudiya (of Gauda) became synonymous with Bengal and Bengalis.https://sanskritdictionary.org/gaudiya =Sena kingdom= Gauda became known as Lakhnauti during the Sena dynasty. The name was in honour of the Sena ruler Lakhsman Sena.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Lakhnauti =Sultanate period= Delhi Sultanate Lakhnauti was conquered in 1204 by the forces of the Delhi Sultanate led by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, who would be effectively be its governor and the first Muslim ruler in Bengal. The Delhi Sultanate retained Lakhnauti as their provincial capital of Bengal. Khalji issued gold coins in honour of the Sultan Muhammad of Ghor, also inscribed in Sanskrit with the words Gaudiya Vijaye (On the conquest of Gauda). On a campaign towards Tibet in 1206, Bakhtiyar left Shiran Khalji to govern Bengal as a substitute. Bakhtiyar would die on this expedition, officially leaving Shiran as the next governor of Lakhnauti who would shortly be succeeded by Ali Mardan Khalji and Iwaz Khalji. The latter would declare independence from Delhi which would also lead to his death. Independent Lakhnauti In 1281, Nasiruddin Bughra Khan, the Governor of Lakhnauti, declared independence from the Delhi Sultanate. He would be succeeded by his son, Rukunuddin Kaikaus who expanded the kingdom. During his rule, the Lakhnauti-based kingdom expanded into Satgaon in the south, Bihar in the west, Devkot in the north. His successor was Shamsuddin Firuz Shah, who played pivotal roles in completing Kaikaus' work in Satgaon before proceeding to take over Mymensingh and Sonargaon. In 1303, Firuz's nephew Sikandar Khan Ghazi and commander-in- chief Syed Nasiruddin teamed up with Shah Jalal and his forces in the Conquest of Sylhet against the Gour Kingdom. Sylhet was successfully incorporated into Firuz's Lakhnauti kingdom. His successor, Ghiyasuddin Bahadur Shah would lose independence to the Delhi Sultanate once again. Bengal Sultanate Maritime links of the Bengal Sultanate. Gauda was widely known as Gaur during the Bengal Sultanate. The founder of the sultanate, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, was Delhi's governor in Satgaon. Ilyas Shah rebelled and overthrew Gaur's governor Alauddin Ali Shah in 1342. Ilyas Shah united the Bengal region into a separate independent state from Delhi in 1352. Pandua became the first capital of the sultanate. In 1450, Sultan Mahmud Shah of Bengal announced the transfer of Bengal's capital from Pandua to Gaur. The transfer was completed by 1453. Gaur served as the Bengali sultanate's capital for over one hundred years until 1565. Gaur was one of the most densely populated cities in the Indian subcontinent, with a population rivaling that of Fatehpur Sikri. The city had a citadel, a royal palace and durbar, many mosques, residences for aristocrats and merchants, and bazaars. Portuguese travelers left detailed and extensive accounts of Gaur. The Portuguese compared the affluence of the city with Lisbon. The royal palace was divided into three compartments. A high wall enclosed the palace. A moat surrounded the palace on three sides and was connected to the Ganges, which guarded the western side of the citadel. According to a contemporary Vaishnava poet, Sultan Alauddin Hussain Shah once saw a procession led by Sri Chaitanya on the opposite bank of the river. The first compartment in the north included the durbar. An inscription of Sultan Rukunuddin Barbak Shah mentions a fountain and water channel located halfway from the Dakhil Darwaza gate. The gate still stands today. According to the Portuguese and medieval Bengali poet Krittibas Ojha, the road from the Dakhil Darwaza to the durbar had nine well-guarded gates, of which two can still be identified today. The second compartment was the living quarter of the Sultan which was adorned with glazed tiles of various colors. The third compartment was the harem. Many artifacts have been recovered from the palace grounds, including enameled bricks and Chinese porcelain. In 1521, a Portuguese visitor saw Sultan Nusrat Shah enjoying polo being played on the plains below the citadel.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Gaur,_City Gaur was the center of regional politics. The deposed Arakanese king Min Saw Mon was granted asylum in Gaur. The Sultan of Bengal dispatched a military expedition from Gaur to achieve the Reconquest of Arakan. The Portuguese historian Castenhada de Lopez described the houses of Gaur. Most buildings were one storeyed with ornamental floor tiles, courtyards and gardens. There were canals and bridges.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Gaur,_City Bengal attracted many Eurasian merchants during the Sultanate period and Gaur was a center of trade like other erstwhile Bengali cities, including Pandua, Chittagong, Sonargaon and Satgaon. Bengal also attracted immigrants from North India, the Middle East, and Central Asia. In the 16th-century, Gaur was occupied by the Mughal emperor Humayun who sought to name it as Jannatabad (heavenly city).http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Gaur,_City The city was looted and plundered during Sher Shah Suri's invasion. After 1565, Sultan Sulaiman Khan Karrani shifted the capital to Tandah. In 1575, Gaur was conquered by a Mughal contingent led by Munim Khan. The Bengal Sultanate ended during the Battle of Rajmahal in 1576.

The two-storeyed Mughal Tahakhana complex was a resting place for viceroys. The tahkhana in Persian means a building with a cool environment.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tahkhana_Complex The name indicates that the complex had an indoor ventilation system to moderate humid temperatures. The complex was also used as a Sufi khanqah.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tahkhana_Complex The Lukochori Darwaza (hide and seek gate) was erected on the road that led to the complex. The construction of these structures can be traced to the reign of viceroy Shah Shuja.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Gaur,_City An outbreak of the plague and a change in the course of the Ganges caused the city to be abandoned. Since then the area has been a heap of ruins in the wilderness and almost overgrown with jungle.

Historical measurements and statistics Yusufshah, 1477 AD, British Museum.British Museum Collection Another inscription from the site in the British Museum The city in its prime measured 7 1/8 km. from north to south, with a breadth of 1 to 2 km. With suburbs it covered an area of 20 to 30 km¬≤., and in the 16th century the Portuguese historian Faria y Sousa described it as containing 1,200,000 inhabitants. The ramparts of this walled city (which was surrounded by extensive suburbs) still exist; they were works of vast labour, and were on the average about high, and 180 to thick at the base. The facing of masonry and the buildings with which they were covered have now disappeared, and the embankments themselves are overgrown with dense jungle. The western side of the city was washed by the Ganges, and within the space enclosed by these embankments and the river stood the city of Gau·∏ça proper, with the fort containing the palace in its south-west corner. Radiating north, south and east from the city, other embankments are to be traced running through the suburbs and extending in certain directions for 30 or 40 m. Surrounding the palace is an inner embankment of similar construction to that which surrounds the city, and even more overgrown with jungle. A deep moat protects it on the outside. To the north of the outer embankment lies the Sagar Dighi, a great reservoir, 1600 yd. by 800 yd., dating from 1126. Fergusson in his History of Eastern Architecture thus describes the general architectural style of Gau·∏ça: Notable structures Choto Sona Mosque in 1808 According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, \\"The Tantipar mosque (1475‚Äì1480) has beautiful moulding in brick, and the Lotan mosque of the same period is unique in retaining its glazed tiles. The citadel, of the Muslim period, was strongly fortified with a rampart and entered through a magnificent gateway called the Dakhil Darwaza (1459‚Äì1474). At the south-east corner was a palace, surrounded by a wall of brick high, of which a part is standing. Nearby were the royal tombs. Within the citadel is the Kadam Rasul mosque (1530), which is still used, and close outside is a tall tower called the Firoz Minar (perhaps signifying tower of victory). There are a number of Muslim buildings on the banks of the Sagar Dighi, including, notably, the tomb of the saint Makhdum Shaikh Akhi Siraj (died 1357), and in the neighbourhood is a burning ghat, traditionally the only one allowed to the use of the Hindus by their Muslim conquerors, and still greatly venerated and frequented by them. Many inscriptions of historical importance have been found in the ruins..\\" Preservation The Kotwali Gate marks the border between Bangladesh and India. The Archaeological Survey of India and the Department of Archaeology in Bangladesh are responsible for preserving heritage structures in the area. The Bangladeshi Archaeology Department has carried out several projects in both the Bangladeshi and Indian sides of Gauda.http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Gaur,_City The Indian archaeological survey is also carrying out excavations of a mound about a kilometre from the Chikha building within the Baisgaji Wall where remains of a palace are turning up. A permanent artefact and photographic exhibition highlighting the major monuments of Gour and the restoration work undertaken by the ASI is being held at the Metcalfe Hall, Kolkata. Among the exhibits are also some fine specimens of brick moulding and glazed tiles from Gour. Transport Bus and rail transport are available from Kolkata to Malda town. Nearest railway station is Gour Malda railway station. Gauda can be accessed through the Sonamosjid checkpoint on the Bangladesh-India border. The checkpoint is located near the Choto Sona Mosque in Chapai Nawabganj district, Bangladesh.https://www.bangladeshtradeportal.gov.bd/kcfinder/upload/files/Land%20Ports%20in%20a%20Brief%281%29.pdf Notes References * endnotes: M.

Lady Wang married her husband, the eventual Xin emperor Wang Mang while he was still a commoner (albeit a well-connected commoner, being the nephew of then-Han empress Empress Wang Zhengjun). She was the daughter of Wang Xian (ÁéãÂí∏), the Marquess of Yichun, who was the grandson of Han prime minister Wang Xin (ÁéãË®¢). (Her marriage to Wang Mang is evidence that at that time, the Chinese prohibition against endogamy based on the same family name was not as strict as it was later.) Lady Wang bore her husband at least five children‚Äîsons Wang Yu (ÁéãÂÆá), Wang Huo (ÁéãÁç≤), Wang An (ÁéãÂÆâ), and Wang Lin (ÁéãËá®), and a daughter (personal name unknown) who later became empress to Emperor Ping of Han and was given the title of Princess Huanghuang during Xin Dynasty. Wang Mang was publicly known for his marital faithfulness, and he put on the appearance that he had no concubines or other female liaisons in addition to his wife. However, that was not true, for Wang Mang had affairs with at least three servant women and, later, a lady-in-waiting to Empress Wang. He was also known for his minimising personal expenditure which extended to his wife. In one incident when he was the commander of the armed forces under his cousin Emperor Cheng of Han, after his mother died, when Lady Wang came to greet the mourners she was in clothes that were so plain that she was mistaken for a servant. During her husband's career, Lady Wang lost two sons at her husband's hands. Wang Huo was forced to commit suicide in 5 BCE after killing a servant. Wang Yu was also forced to commit suicide, in 3 CE, after the failure of a conspiracy with Emperor Ping's maternal uncles of the Wei clan to overthrow Wang Mang's dictatorial regency. Because of these tragedies, Lady Wang lamented and cried so much that eventually she grew blind. In 9 CE, after Wang Mang usurped the Han throne and declared himself the emperor of the Xin Dynasty, Lady Wang was created empress. Of her two surviving sons, the younger Wang Lin was considered more capable, so Wang Mang created him crown prince, while Wang An was created the Lord of Xinjia. Due to Empress Wang's blindness, Wang Mang asked Crown Prince Lin to move into the palace to attend to her. Empress Wang died in 21 CE. After her death, her two surviving sons also died in the same year. Wang Lin committed suicide by the sword after his plot to kill his father (because he was fearful that his father would discover that he carried on an affair with Empress Wang's lady-in-waiting Yuan Bi (ÂéüÁ¢ß), whom Wang Mang had also an affair with) was discovered, and Wang An died of natural causes. Her husband and her daughter would die in 23 CE when Xin Dynasty was destroyed by the people rebelling as a result of the emperor's incompetence.

Most pub games date back many years and are rooted in village culture. Many derive from older outdoor sports. Pub games can be loosely grouped into throwing games, dice games, card games, board games, cue and ball games, bat and ball games, coin pushing/throwing games, and drinking games. History In his book, Beer and Skittles, Richard Boston claims that the first regulation concerning national control of pubs was about pub games; Henry VII's statute of 1495 restricted the playing of \\"indoor games which were distracting Tudor pubmen from archery\\". Many of pub games owe their origins to older outdoor sports, adapted and transformed over time for indoor play, either for convenience, or to allow publicans to maintain their teams during the off-season. Gaming activities associated with pubs included card games such as cribbage, throwing games such as darts, physical sports such as cricket, and blood sports such as cock fighting. Balls Pond Road in Highbury, London, was named after an establishment run by Mr Ball that had a pond out the back filled with ducks, where drinkers could, for a certain fee, go out and take their chance at shooting the creatures.The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland, 1868, quoted in GENUKI-Islington Notable pub games Pub games can be loosely grouped into throwing games, dice games, card games, board games, cue and ball games, bat and ball games, coin pushing/throwing games, and drinking games. =Throwing games= Darts A game which involves the throwing of small missiles at a circular target, called a dartboard. It is one of the few traditional pub games that remains popular to the present day and is played in many countries. When played at a professional level the game adheres to a specific board design and set of rules, but as a pub game it can encompasses several variants, such as 'Cricket'. Aunt Sally A game of Aunt Sally from the 1911 edition of Whiteley's General Catalogue Traditionally played in pubs and fairgrounds. An Aunt Sally was originally a figurine head of an old woman with a clay pipe in her mouth, or subsequently a ball on a stick. The object was for players to throw sticks at the head in order to break the pipe. The game bears some resemblance to a coconut shy, or skittles. Today, the game of Aunt Sally is still played as a pub game in Oxfordshire. The ball is on a short plinth about 4 inches (10 cm) high, and is known as a 'dolly'. The dolly is placed on a dog-legged metal spike and players throw sticks or short battens at the dolly, trying to knock it off without hitting the spike. Devil among the tailors A form of table skittles. The game involves 9 small skittles arranged in a 3 x 3 square, usually within a shallow open-topped wooden box sitting on a table-top. The wooden ball (about the size of a golf ball) hangs from a string or chain attached to the top of a vertical wooden post rising from one corner of the box. The aim of the game is to knock down the skittles by swinging the ball in an arc round the post (rather than aiming directly at the skittles). In the picturesque name, the 'devil' refers to the ball and the 'tailors' are the skittles. Ringing the bull A game which involves swinging a bull's nose-ring, which is attached to a string, in an arc so as to hook it onto a bull's horn or hook attached to the wall. It was adopted by the earlier settlers of the Caribbean islands, where it is also referred to as the Bimini Ring Game. The game is still played in Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem, in Nottingham, which claims to be Britain's oldest pub. Quoits A game which involves the throwing of metal, rope or rubber rings over a set distance, usually to land over or near a spike. The sport encompasses several distinct variations which are played either indoors on a small elevated table, or outside on a marked strip. =Dice games= Bar dice is a simple game played with five dice and a cup, often played to determine who buys the next round of drinks. =Card games= Numerous card games have been traditionally played in pubs. Those still popular to the present day include cribbage and poker. =Cue and ball games= Pool Also known as 'pocket billiards, it is played on a table with six pockets into which balls are deposited in a specified order. The game encompasses distinct variants, including eight-ball, nine-ball and several others. Bar billiards The game, in its current form, started in the UK in the 1930s. The tables were made by the Jelkes company of Holloway Road in London, and sold to many pubs. Today, it mostly played in southern England and Jersey on a special table without side and corner pockets, but with 9 scoring holes in the playing surface. On the playfield are normally placed three skittles--guarding the highest scoring holes (the two 50 point holes and the 200 point hole). The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by potting balls down the holes before either the time runs out or a skittle is knocked over. The last ball can only be potted by getting it into the 100 or 200 point hole after bouncing off one cushion. =Bat and ball games= =Coin pushing/throwing games= Pitch penny A game which involves throwing coins across the room and into a hole carved in the seat of a wooden bench. Shove ha'penny (or \\"shove halfpenny\\") Played by two players on a small, smooth board, made of slate or wood. A number of parallel lines or grooves run horizontally across this board. Ha'pennies or similarly-sized coins or metal discs are placed at one end of the board and are shoved with a quick flick of the hand. The object is to shove the coins so that a certain number of them (normally five) lie between the lines. The two players take alternate turns. In addition to shoving his own coin directly between the lines, a player may use his turn to knock his own coins into position. One set of coins is used by both players. Toad in the hole Involves the throwing of brass discs, called Toads, at a hole in a lead-topped table. A variation of this game has been played in pubs in East Sussex, UK, the 'hole' being in the centre of the lead surface. =Drinking games= Hope and Anchor, Hammersmith, London, UK =Other notable pub games= Table football Bagatelle Bowls Skittles Shuffleboard Goblin Game  See also  * Trivia * Karaoke References  External links * Online guide to traditional games * Toad in the hole in the Online guide to traditional games * Shove ha'penny Article * Hickok Sports History * ","title":"Pub game"},{"id":"2627722","text":"Coat of arms H√∂rde is a Stadtbezirk (\\"City District\\") and also a Stadtteil (Quarter) in the south of the city of Dortmund, in Germany. H√∂rde is situated at 51¬∞29' North, 7¬∞30' West, and is at an elevation of 112 metres above mean sea level. It is situated in the southern part of Dortmund, a major town in the Ruhrgebiet. It is made up of the areas of Wellinghofen, H√∂chsten, Benninghofen, Loh, Holzen, Sommerberg, Syburg, and Wichlinghofen, as well as H√∂rde itself. The region was formerly a heavy industry area, particularly for the production and working of steel. The river Emscher flows through H√∂rde. It flows through the former \\"Phoenix\\" industrial park, which is currently being restored to a natural area. When finished, the Emscher will once again be a clean river, and there will be a lake (Phoenix-See). Coat of arms The Coat of Arms of the Stadtbezirk shows the H√∂rder Burg (H√∂rde Castle), overlaid with a red-and-white chequered band that was used as the sign of the Counts of Mark. The semicircle is originally green and represents a meadow. The background is golden. History Originally H√∂rde was a separate town (until 1929), rather than forming part of Dortmund. The name derives from the natural surroundings: \\"H√∂rde\\" derives from \\"Huryde\\" or \\"Huride\\", meaning \\"fold\\". The town was founded by the Counts of Mark in opposition to their principal enemy, the town of Dortmund. The first settlers were Wellinghofer, who had been resettled by the count. The count wanted to surround Dortmund by separate towns (including the towns of Herdecke, Witten, Bochum, Castrop, L√ºnen, Unna und Schwerte). In 1388, the \\"Gro√üen Dortmunder Fehde\\" (great feud of Dortmund) took place, where the city of Dortmund battled against the alliance of surrounding towns. The struggle ended in 1390, with defeat for H√∂rde and its allies. Until 1929 H√∂rde was an independent city, and the capital of the eponymous region, before being incorporated by Dortmund. During the time of the Third Reich, a Gestapo jail was located in a H√∂rde police station. In 1945, the murder of many political prisoners which took place in Dortmund Rombergpark was organised from here. Notable sights A symbol of H√∂rde is the Schlanke Mathilde (\\"Slim Matilda\\"), rebuilt in 1983 from historical pictures. It represented a former mayor's wife, and was allegedly built by the citizens of the town to annoy the mayor, whose wife was far from slim. The H√∂rder Burg (H√∂rde castle) is located in the east of the town, close to the river Emscher. It was built in the 12th century, and today houses a museum.

Located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, the school has been operated by the Carmelite order of priests and brothers since 1900. Several priests and brothers who teach at the school live in the nearby Saint Cyril Priory, though most of the staff consists of lay teachers. Mount Carmel is occasionally confused with Carmel High School in Mundelein, Illinois, and Mount Carmel High School in Mount Carmel, Illinois. The former is also a Carmelite school, while the latter is the town of Mount Carmel's only public high school. History In the Fall of 1900, the Carmelite order established St. Cyril College at 54th and Jefferson (now Harper) on Chicago's South Side. In the first year there were 13 students and five priest teachers. The following year the college was moved to 64th and Washington (now Blackstone) because of the need for a larger building and better access to public transportation. The St. Cyril College Building at 64th and Star (now Dante) was completed in 1902, and classes began with 137 students and 11 faculty members. The school was consecrated by Bishop Peter Muldoon on August 10, 1902; a delay caused by the death of Archbishop Patrick Feehan. Upon opening the college had three departments: (1) Academic, which included both a junior high and a high school program; (2) College, a four-year program with emphasis on Greek and Latin; (3) Commercial, a three-year course. In September 1910, the school hosted Vincenzo Cardinal Vannutelli, about ten years before becoming Dean of the College of Cardinals. In 1918, with young men being called to serve in World War I, the college curriculum was dropped while the high school department was enlarged and improved. Dedication ‚Äì 1924 In December 1922, Father Elias Magennis, General of the Carmelite Order, and Archbishop Mundelein of Chicago agreed on the need for the immediate construction of a new St. Cyril High School Building. In the spring and summer of 1924, a three-story main building was erected by the Thompson-Starrett Construction Company with Zachary Davis (the \\"Frank Lloyd Wright of Baseball\\") as the architect. William Lynch, a St. Cyril College graduate, was in charge of construction. Later that fall, the new building was dedicated as Mount Carmel High School. During World War II, Mt. Carmel began preparing students for wartime employment or military service, offering courses in aerodynamics, meteorology, navigation, and civil air regulations. Countless alumni from the G.I. Generation went on to serve in the United States Military. In the 1960s and 70s, economic and sociological factors changed Mount Carmel's Woodlawn neighborhood- fewer Catholics were living in the immediate area and the school's enrollment dropped. Mount Carmel's close proximity to the Black Stone Rangers/Black P. Stones/El Rukn street gang may have also hurt their ability to maintain enrollment. Despite these conditions, improved bus routes permitted many students to continue reaching the school. Campus The Mount Carmel campus is located at the intersection of East 64th Street and South Dante Avenue, near historic Jackson Park, Lake Michigan and the University of Chicago campus. The oldest surviving campus structures are the Carmelite Chapel and three-story main building from 1924 (see photo above). In the early 1950s, Mt. Carmel built a Student Center on the north side of the main building. Then in 1968, a grant from the Archdiocese of Chicago's \\"Project: Renew\\" permitted the construction of a learning center and library that connected the main building to the student center. The campus would grow again to include Carey Field on the south end of school property. Thanks to the Capital Campaign Case Study, the Walter Scott School property was acquired- and in 1992, construction began on a new monastery for the Carmelites. The Graham Center was then constructed on the site of the old Carmelite Monastery. Although the old Priory was demolished to make room for the science and computer center, the original Chapel was saved and given a facelift. In 1999, the Scott School property was used to build Haggerty Field for soccer and baseball. The campus again expanded in 2005 by adding the Mt. Carmel Convocation Center on the site of the old student parking lot. This addition is home to offices and meeting areas for alumni and faculty, a student commons/dining hall, new computer and science labs, and the Cacciatore Athletic Center. The athletic center features three gyms, an indoor track, locker rooms and a modern weight room. A new student parking lot was built on the north end of the campus. Ongoing maintenance to existing facilities have included renovations to the original pool and Carey Field, which was converted to a multipurpose Sprint Turf playing surface. In the Fall of 2019, \\"Barda- Dowling Stadium\\" was added to Carey Field, with two permanent bleachers on the East end zone and South Sideline; the stadium also includes a press-box which houses the scoreboard, announcer, and the school's student broadcast team. The 'Old Gym' is still maintained to host athletic competition, including wrestling and the school's annual Fight Night boxing event. From 2016 to 2019, Mount Carmel has renovated the interior of the original school building, adding a more technology-friendly and modern school environment. The school also plans on renovating the student center into either a fully functioning theater for the Drama Club and Band or a new cafeteria. Academics Mount Carmel has been recognized as a Blue RibbonBlue Ribbon Schools 1982-2002. and National Exemplary School, and offers four comprehensive programs of study to serve the needs of all college bound students: The Honors/Advanced Placement Program Excel Program Foundations Program McDermott-Doyle Program for Developmental Learning *Renewable tuition reductions, or academic scholarships, are available to incoming freshmen based on their performance on the entrance exam. Athletics Mount Carmel competes in the Chicago Catholic League (CCL). The school's forerunner, St. Cyril, was one of the eight founding members of the league in 1912, and Mount Carmel is one of five remaining charter members. Mount Carmel is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) and teams are stylized as the Caravan. Mount Carmel sponsors interscholastic athletic teams in: baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, volleyball, water polo, and wrestling. While not sponsored by the IHSA, the school also sponsors ice hockey and rugby. The following teams have won their respective state championship tournament or meet: * Baseball (IHSA 4A): 2012‚Äì13 * Basketball (IHSA AA): 1984‚Äì85 * Football (IHSA, multiple classes): 1980‚Äì81, 1988‚Äì89, 1989‚Äì90, 1990‚Äì91, 1991‚Äì92, 1996‚Äì97, 1998‚Äì99, 1999‚Äì2000, 2000‚Äì01, 2002‚Äì03, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2019-20. * Ice Hockey (AHAI) : 1979, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990 * Wrestling (IHSA AA): 1991‚Äì92, 1992‚Äì93, 1993‚Äì94 * Water Polo (Illinois Water Polo): 1975 The football team's 13 state championships are tied with Joliet Catholic for the most in state history, while they are second in all-time in wins (734) to East St. Louis, Senior (761). The football team is also credited with a record 14 Chicago Prep Bowl Championships in 1927, 1933, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1960, 1967, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1993, 2001, 2011, 2015, and 2016. The 1932 Prep Bowl was not played when the Public League champion refused to play; Mount Carmel claims this as a forfeit championship.city championships The school also claims a Prep Bowl championship in 1939, a game that ended in a tie. The Ice Hockey Club has amassed a Catholic League record 20 Kennedy Cup awards (1965, 1973, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000) In 1908, the first ever basketball game played by DePaul University was a game against St. Cyril's on January 7, 1908. In 1916, St. Cyril's and Hyde Park High School competed in the first ever dual boxing meet between Cook County schools. The tradition of boxing at Mt. Carmel continues to present day at the annual Fight Night in Spring. In 1985, coach Ed McQuillan led Mt. Carmel's basketball team to the IHSA's large class (\\"AA\\") state championship- the first won by a Parochial school. Future Los Angeles Laker Mel McCants and New York Giant Chris Calloway led the team to a 28-4 overall record, culminating in a victory over Springfield Lanphier at Assembly Hall in Champaign. James Farr scored 30 of the team's 46 points and Derek Boyd's buzzer beater in double overtime sealed the victory. . In 1995, Mt. Carmel's wrestling team was in contention for its fourth consecutive state championship. After winning its regional tournament, the IHSA disqualified the team from further participation, claiming the team had violated the cap on tournament participation. Mt. Carmel filed suit in court, and a Cook County judge determined that the IHSA was following its rules arbitrarily, and ordered the Association to restore Mt. Carmel to the state tournament. An hour after the Illinois Supreme Court ruled on an IHSA appeal, and sided with Mt. Carmel, the IHSA suspended the dual team state tournament. The IHSA attempted to appeal to the original judge. When that failed, the tournament was cancelled.

The word optics is derived from the Greek term meaning \\"appearance, look\\". Optics was significantly reformed by the developments in the medieval Islamic world, such as the beginnings of physical and physiological optics, and then significantly advanced in early modern Europe, where diffractive optics began. These earlier studies on optics are now known as \\"classical optics\\". The term \\"modern optics\\" refers to areas of optical research that largely developed in the 20th century, such as wave optics and quantum optics. Early history In ancient India, the philosophical schools of Samkhya and Vaisheshika, from around the 6th-5th century BC, developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental \\"subtle\\" elements (tanmatra) out of which emerge the gross elements. In contrast, the Vaisheshika school gives an atomic theory of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of ether, space and time. (See Indian atomism.) The basic atoms are those of earth (prthivƒ±), water (apas), fire (tejas), and air (vayu), that should not be confused with the ordinary meaning of these terms. These atoms are taken to form binary molecules that combine further to form larger molecules. Motion is defined in terms of the movement of the physical atoms. Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of tejas (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the tejas atoms. Around the first century BC, the Vishnu Purana refers to sunlight as \\"the seven rays of the sun\\". In the fifth century BC, Empedocles postulated that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun. He stated that light has a finite speed. In his Optics Greek mathematician Euclid observed that \\"things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal\\". In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Pappus believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's Optics, along with his Phaenomena, in the Little Astronomy, a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the Syntaxis (Almagest) of Ptolemy. In 55 BC, Lucretius, a Roman atomists, wrote: In his Catoptrica, Hero of Alexandria showed by a geometrical method that the actual path taken by a ray of light reflected from a plane mirror is shorter than any other reflected path that might be drawn between the source and point of observation. In the second century Claudius Ptolemy, in his Optics undertook studies of reflection and refraction. He measured the angles of refraction between air, water, and glass, and his published results indicate that he adjusted his measurements to fit his (incorrect) assumption that the angle of refraction is proportional to the angle of incidence. The Indian Buddhists, such as DignƒÅga in the 5th century and Dharmakirti in the 7th century, developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy, similar to the modern concept of photons, though they also viewed all matter as being composed of these light/energy particles. =Geometrical optics= The early writers discussed here treated vision more as a geometrical than as a physical, physiological, or psychological problem. The first known author of a treatise on geometrical optics was the geometer Euclid (c. 325 BC‚Äì265 BC). Euclid began his study of optics as he began his study of geometry, with a set of self-evident axioms. # Lines (or visual rays) can be drawn in a straight line to the object. # Those lines falling upon an object form a cone. # Those things upon which the lines fall are seen. # Those things seen under a larger angle appear larger. # Those things seen by a higher ray, appear higher. # Right and left rays appear right and left. # Things seen within several angles appear clearer. Euclid did not define the physical nature of these visual rays but, using the principles of geometry, he discussed the effects of perspective and the rounding of things seen at a distance. Where Euclid had limited his analysis to simple direct vision, Hero of Alexandria (c. AD 10‚Äì70) extended the principles of geometrical optics to consider problems of reflection (catoptrics). Unlike Euclid, Hero occasionally commented on the physical nature of visual rays, indicating that they proceeded at great speed from the eye to the object seen and were reflected from smooth surfaces but could become trapped in the porosities of unpolished surfaces.D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 14-15. This has come to be known as emission theory. Hero demonstrated the equality of the angle of incidence and reflection on the grounds that this is the shortest path from the object to the observer. On this basis, he was able to define the fixed relation between an object and its image in a plane mirror. Specifically, the image appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object really is in front of the mirror. Like Hero, Ptolemy in his Optics (preserved only in the form of a Latin translation of a gravely defective Arabic version) considered the visual rays as proceeding from the eye to the object seen, but, unlike Hero, considered that the visual rays were not discrete lines, but formed a continuous cone. Ptolemy extended the study of vision beyond direct and reflected vision; he also studied vision by refracted rays (dioptrics), when we see objects through the interface between two media of different density. He conducted experiments to measure the path of vision when we look from air to water, from air to glass, and from water to glass and tabulated the relationship between the incident and refracted rays.D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), p. 16; A. M. Smith, Ptolemy's search for a law of refraction: a case-study in the classical methodology of 'saving the appearances' and its limitations, Arch. Hist. Exact Sci. 26 (1982), 221-240; Ptolemy's procedure is reported in the fifth chapter of his Optics. His tabulated results have been studied for the air water interface, and in general the values he obtained reflect the theoretical refraction given by modern theory, but the outliers are distorted to represent Ptolemy's a priori model of the nature of refraction. In the Islamic world Ibn Sahl's manuscript showing his discovery of the law of refraction, now known as Snell's law. Al-Kindi (c. 801‚Äì873) was one of the earliest important optical writers in the Islamic world. In a work known in the west as De radiis stellarum, al-Kindi developed a theory \\"that everything in the world ... emits rays in every direction, which fill the whole world.\\"Cited in D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), p. 19. theorem of Ibn Haytham This theory of the active power of rays had an influence on later scholars such as Ibn al-Haytham, Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon. Ibn Sahl, a mathematician active in Baghdad during the 980s, is the first Islamic scholar known to have compiled a commentary on Ptolemy's Optics. His treatise Fƒ´ al-'ƒÅla al-mu·∏•riqa \\"On the burning instruments\\" was reconstructed from fragmentary manuscripts by Rashed (1993).Rashed, R., G√©om√©trie et dioptrique au Xe si√®cle: Ibn Sahl, al-Quhi et Ibn al-Haytham. Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1993 The work is concerned with how curved mirrors and lenses bend and focus light. Ibn Sahl also describes a law of refraction mathematically equivalent to Snell's law. He used his law of refraction to compute the shapes of lenses and mirrors that focus light at a single point on the axis. Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), \\"the father of Optics\\" Ibn al-Haytham (known in as Alhacen or Alhazen in Western Europe), writing in the 1010s, received both Ibn Sahl's treatise and a partial Arabic translation of Ptolemy's Optics. He produced a comprehensive and systematic analysis of Greek optical theories. Ibn al-Haytham's key achievement was twofold: first, to insist, against the opinion of Ptolemy, that vision occurred because of rays entering the eye; the second was to define the physical nature of the rays discussed by earlier geometrical optical writers, considering them as the forms of light and color.\\"How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our Book of Optics. But let us now mention something to prove this convincingly: the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes.... [T]he entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air.\\" ‚Äì Alhazen, Treatise on Light (ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ∂Ÿàÿ°), translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from \\"Abhandlung √ºber das Licht\\", J. Baarmann (editor and translator from Arabic to German, 1882) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft Vol 36, as cited by Samuel Sambursky (1974), Physical thought from the Pre-socratics to the quantum physicists He then analyzed these physical rays according to the principles of geometrical optics. He wrote many books on optics, most significantly the Book of Optics (Kitab al Manazir in Arabic), translated into Latin as the De aspectibus or Perspectiva, which disseminated his ideas to Western Europe and had great influence on the later developments of optics.D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 58-86; Nader El-Bizri 'A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen's Optics', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 15 (2005), 189‚Äì218. Ibn al-Haytham was called \\"the father of modern optics\\". Avicenna (980-1037) agreed with Alhazen that the speed of light is finite, as he \\"observed that if the perception of light is due to the emission of some sort of particles by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite.\\"George Sarton, Introduction to the History of Science, Vol. 1, p. 710. Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ (973-1048) also agreed that light has a finite speed, and stated that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound. Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ma'udh, who lived in Al- Andalus during the second half of the 11th century, wrote a work on optics later translated into Latin as Liber de crepisculis, which was mistakenly attributed to Alhazen. This was a \\"short work containing an estimation of the angle of depression of the sun at the beginning of the morning twilight and at the end of the evening twilight, and an attempt to calculate on the basis of this and other data the height of the atmospheric moisture responsible for the refraction of the sun's rays.\\" Through his experiments, he obtained the value of 18¬∞, which comes close to the modern value. In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236‚Äì1311) and his student KamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al- FƒÅrisƒ´ (1260‚Äì1320) continued the work of Ibn al-Haytham, and they were among the first to give the correct explanations for the rainbow phenomenon. Al- FƒÅrisƒ´ published his findings in his Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir (The Revision of [Ibn al-Haytham's] Optics). In medieval Europe The English bishop, Robert Grosseteste (c. 1175‚Äì1253), wrote on a wide range of scientific topics at the time of the origin of the medieval university and the recovery of the works of Aristotle. Grosseteste reflected a period of transition between the Platonism of early medieval learning and the new Aristotelianism, hence he tended to apply mathematics and the Platonic metaphor of light in many of his writings. He has been credited with discussing light from four different perspectives: an epistemology of light, a metaphysics or cosmogony of light, an etiology or physics of light, and a theology of light.D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 94-99. Setting aside the issues of epistemology and theology, Grosseteste's cosmogony of light describes the origin of the universe in what may loosely be described as a medieval \\"big bang\\" theory. Both his biblical commentary, the Hexaemeron (1230 x 35), and his scientific On Light (1235 x 40), took their inspiration from Genesis 1:3, \\"God said, let there be light\\", and described the subsequent process of creation as a natural physical process arising from the generative power of an expanding (and contracting) sphere of light.R. W. Southern, Robert Grosseteste: The Growth of an English Mind in Medieval Europe, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), pp. 136-9, 205-6. Optical diagram showing light being refracted by a spherical glass container full of water. (from Roger Bacon, De multiplicatione specierum) His more general consideration of light as a primary agent of physical causation appears in his On Lines, Angles, and Figures where he asserts that \\"a natural agent propagates its power from itself to the recipient\\" and in On the Nature of Places where he notes that \\"every natural action is varied in strength and weakness through variation of lines, angles and figures.\\"A. C. Crombie, Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), p. 110 The English Franciscan, Roger Bacon (c. 1214‚Äì1294) was strongly influenced by Grosseteste's writings on the importance of light. In his optical writings (the Perspectiva, the De multiplicatione specierum, and the De speculis comburentibus) he cited a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works, including those of Alhacen, Aristotle, Avicenna, Averroes, Euclid, al-Kindi, Ptolemy, Tideus, and Constantine the African. Although he was not a slavish imitator, he drew his mathematical analysis of light and vision from the writings of the Arabic writer, Alhacen. But he added to this the Neoplatonic concept, perhaps drawn from Grosseteste, that every object radiates a power (species) by which it acts upon nearby objects suited to receive those species.D. C. Lindberg, \\"Roger Bacon on Light, Vision, and the Universal Emanation of Force\\", pp. 243-275 in Jeremiah Hackett, ed., Roger Bacon and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays, (Leiden: Brill, 1997), pp. 245-250; Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 107-18; The Beginnings of Western Science, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1992, p. 313. Note that Bacon's optical use of the term \\"species\\" differs significantly from the genus / species categories found in Aristotelian philosophy. Several later works, including the influential A Moral Treatise on the Eye (Latin: Tractatus Moralis de Oculo) by Peter of Limoges (1240‚Äì1306), helped popularize and spread the ideas found in Bacon's writings. Another English Franciscan, John Pecham (died 1292) built on the work of Bacon, Grosseteste, and a diverse range of earlier writers to produce what became the most widely used textbook on Optics of the Middle Ages, the Perspectiva communis. His book centered on the question of vision, on how we see, rather than on the nature of light and color. Pecham followed the model set forth by Alhacen, but interpreted Alhacen's ideas in the manner of Roger Bacon.D. C. Lindberg, John Pecham and the Science of Optics: Perspectiva communis, (Madison, Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1970), pp. 12-32; Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 116-18. Like his predecessors, Witelo (born circa 1230, died between 1280 and 1314) drew on the extensive body of optical works recently translated from Greek and Arabic to produce a massive presentation of the subject entitled the Perspectiva. His theory of vision follows Alhacen and he does not consider Bacon's concept of species, although passages in his work demonstrate that he was influenced by Bacon's ideas. Judging from the number of surviving manuscripts, his work was not as influential as those of Pecham and Bacon, yet his importance, and that of Pecham, grew with the invention of printing.D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 118-20. Theodoric of Freiberg (ca. 1250‚Äìca. 1310) was among the first in Europe to provide the correct scientific explanation for the rainbow phenomenon, as well as Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236‚Äì1311) and his student KamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-FƒÅrisƒ´ (1260‚Äì1320) mentioned above. Renaissance and Early Modern Johannes Kepler (1571‚Äì1630) picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600. Both lunar and solar eclipses presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of atmospheric refraction applied to all astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as Astronomiae Pars Optica (The Optical Part of Astronomy). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of pinhole cameras, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. Astronomiae Pars Optica is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the law of refraction is conspicuously absent).Caspar, Kepler, pp 142‚Äì146 Willebrord Snellius (1580‚Äì1626) found the mathematical law of refraction, now known as Snell's law, in 1621. Subsequently, Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1650) showed, by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes' law), that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42¬∞ (i.e. the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the rainbow's centre is 42¬∞). He also independently discovered the law of reflection, and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law. Christiaan Huygens (1629‚Äì1695) wrote several works in the area of optics. These included the Opera reliqua (also known as Christiani Hugenii Zuilichemii, dum viveret Zelhemii toparchae, opuscula posthuma) and the Trait√© de la lumi√®re. Isaac Newton (1643‚Äì1727) investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into a spectrum of colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of wave-particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light. In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \\"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\\" quoting Opticks =Diffractive optics= Thomas Young's sketch of two-slit diffraction, which he presented to the Royal Society in 1803 The effects of diffraction of light were carefully observed and characterized by Francesco Maria Grimaldi, who also coined the term diffraction, from the Latin diffringere, 'to break into pieces', referring to light breaking up into different directions. The results of Grimaldi's observations were published posthumously in 1665. Isaac Newton studied these effects and attributed them to inflexion of light rays. James Gregory (1638-1675) observed the diffraction patterns caused by a bird feather, which was effectively the first diffraction grating. In 1803 Thomas Young did his famous experiment observing interference from two closely spaced slits in his double slit interferometer. Explaining his results by interference of the waves emanating from the two different slits, he deduced that light must propagate as waves. Augustin-Jean Fresnel did more definitive studies and calculations of diffraction, published in 1815 and 1818, and thereby gave great support to the wave theory of light that had been advanced by Christiaan Huygens and reinvigorated by Young, against Newton's particle theory. Lenses and lensmaking There is disputed archeological evidence of use of lenses in antiquity, spanning several millennia. It has been suggested that glass eye covers in hieroglyphs from the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2686‚Äì2181 BC) were functional simple glass meniscus lenses.Jay M. Enoch, Remarkable lenses and eye units in statues from the Egyptian Old Kingdom (ca. 4500 years ago): properties, timeline, questions requiring resolution. Proceedings Volume 3749, 18th Congress of the International Commission for Optics; (1999) https://doi.org/10.1117/12.354722 Event: ICO XVIII 18th Congress of the International Commission for Optics, 1999, San Francisco, CA, United States, 19 July 1999 Similarly the so-called Nimrud lens, a rock crystal artifact dated to the 7th century BC, may have been used as a magnifying glass or may have been a decoration.The history of the telescope by Henry C. King, Harold Spencer Jones Publisher Courier Dover Publications, 2003, pp. 25‚Äì27 The earliest written record of magnification dates back to the 1st century AD, when Seneca the Younger, a tutor of Emperor Nero, wrote: \\"Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through a globe or glass filled with water\\". Emperor Nero is also said to have watched the gladiatorial games using an emerald as a corrective lens. Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) wrote about the effects of pinhole, concave lenses, and magnifying glasses in his 1021 AD Book of Optics. The English friar Roger Bacon's 1260s or 1270s written works on optics, partly based on the works of Arab writers, described the function of corrective lenses for vision and burning glasses. These volumes were outlines for a larger publication that was never produced so his ideas never saw mass dissemination.The invention of spectacles, How and where glasses may have begun, The College of Optometrists, college-optometrists.org Between the 11th and 13th century \\"reading stones\\" were invented. Often used by monks to assist in illuminating manuscripts, these were primitive plano-convex lenses initially made by cutting a glass sphere in half. As the stones were experimented with, it was slowly understood that shallower lenses magnified more effectively. Around 1286, possibly in Pisa, Italy, the first pair of eyeglasses were made, although it is unclear who the inventor was. The earliest known working telescopes were the refracting telescopes that appeared in the Netherlands in 1608. Their inventor is unknown: Hans Lippershey applied for the first patent that year followed by a patent application by Jacob Metius of Alkmaar two weeks later (neither was granted since examples of the device seemed to be numerous at the time). Galileo greatly improved upon these designs the following year. Isaac Newton is credited with constructing the first functional reflecting telescope in 1668, his Newtonian reflector. The earliest known examples of compound microscopes, which combine an objective lens near the specimen with an eyepiece to view a real image, appeared in Europe around 1620. The design is very similar to the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown.

Quantum optics  Light is made up of particles called photons and hence inherently is quantized. Quantum optics is the study of the nature and effects of light as quantized photons. The first indication that light might be quantized came from Max Planck in 1899 when he correctly modelled blackbody radiation by assuming that the exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta. It was unknown whether the source of this discreteness was the matter or the light. In 1905, Albert Einstein published the theory of the photoelectric effect. It appeared that the only possible explanation for the effect was the quantization of light itself. Later, Niels Bohr showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts of energy. The understanding of the interaction between light and matter following from these developments not only formed the basis of quantum optics but also were crucial for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. However, the subfields of quantum mechanics dealing with matter-light interaction were principally regarded as research into matter rather than into light and hence, one rather spoke of atom physics and quantum electronics. This changed with the invention of the maser in 1953 and the laser in 1960. Laser science‚Äîresearch into principles, design and application of these devices‚Äîbecame an important field, and the quantum mechanics underlying the laser's principles was studied now with more emphasis on the properties of light, and the name quantum optics became customary. As laser science needed good theoretical foundations, and also because research into these soon proved very fruitful, interest in quantum optics rose. Following the work of Dirac in quantum field theory, George Sudarshan, Roy J. Glauber, and Leonard Mandel applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the statistics of light (see degree of coherence). This led to the introduction of the coherent state as a quantum description of laser light and the realization that some states of light could not be described with classical waves. In 1977, Kimble et al. demonstrated the first source of light which required a quantum description: a single atom that emitted one photon at a time. Another quantum state of light with certain advantages over any classical state, squeezed light, was soon proposed. At the same time, development of short and ultrashort laser pulses‚Äîcreated by Q-switching and mode-locking techniques‚Äîopened the way to the study of unimaginably fast (\\"ultrafast\\") processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. Raman spectroscopy) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an optical trap or optical tweezers by laser beam. This, along with Doppler cooling was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation. Other remarkable results are the demonstration of quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, and (recently, in 1995) quantum logic gates. The latter are of much interest in quantum information theory, a subject which partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from theoretical computer science. Today's fields of interest among quantum optics researchers include parametric down-conversion, parametric oscillation, even shorter (attosecond) light pulses, use of quantum optics for quantum information, manipulation of single atoms and Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates, their application, and how to manipulate them (a sub-field often called atom optics).

The game involves nine small skittles arranged in a 3 √ó 3 square, usually within a shallow open-topped wooden box sitting on a table-top. The wooden ball (about the size of a golf ball) hangs from a string or chain attached to the top of a vertical wooden post rising from one corner of the box. The aim of the game is to knock down the skittles by swinging the ball in an arc round the post (rather than aiming directly at the skittles). It is also the name of a game in which each player spins a spinning top with a string, to knock down skittles, earning points for doing so. This game is quite a large table game, around 1M √ó 1.5M The game may be referred to as \\"De'il Among the Tailors\\" in Scotland. An example of this game is on display in Osterley Manor in London. The game can be seen in a pub setting in the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night at the 1 hour 4 minute mark. Ringo goes AWOL from a gig and ends up annoying people playing various pub games. It is also featured in the Malcolm in the Middle episode \\"Therapy,\\" in which Dewey exhibits a surprising talent for the game. Name origins On 15 August 1805, a play called The Tailors: A Tragedy for Warm Weather, starring William Dowton, was presented at the theatre, then known as The Little Theatre in the Hay. The London tailors took exception to this satire on their craft, and thousands rioted, both inside and outside the theatre. The special constables were helpless against the overwhelming odds, so a troop of Life Guards was called. Sixteen prisoners were taken and the rest dispersed. The Life Guards did their job so effectively that it was likened to a skittle ball ploughing through the skittles. Thereafter, the game of Table Skittles (or Bar Skittles) was often referred to as ‚ÄòDevil Amongst the Tailors‚Äô (or Devil Among the Tailors). Fairburn's edition of the play is entitled The Devil among the Tailors, it includes an account of the event.Brewer In the picturesque name, the 'devil' refers to the ball and the 'tailors' are the skittles.

Geography The Modoc National Forest protects parts of Modoc (82.9% of acreage), Lassen (9.4%), and Siskiyou (7.7%) counties. Most of the forest was covered by immense lava flows occurring over the last 500,000 years. The eastern part of the forest east of Alturas contains the Warner Mountains. The Warner Mountains drop steeply on the eastern slopes, whereas the western flank has a more gentle topography. Ecology Map of the Modoc National Forest Due to the elevation and precipitation differences, the forests hosts a large number of plant species. The western side of the brushy foothills consist mostly of bitterbrush and curl-leaf mahogany. As elevation increases, forests of ponderosa pine, white and red firs, incense cedar, and aspen give way to lodgepole and western white pines sprinkle towards the summit. Some of the forest have been identified as old growth, with lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, white fir, incense cedar, and red fir being common constituents. History Modoc National Forest was established as the Modoc Forest Reserve on November 29, 1904 by the General Land Office. It was named for the Modoc people who traditionally had their territory in this area. In 1905 federal forests were transferred to the U.S. Forest Service, and on March 4, 1907 they became National Forests. On July 1, 1908 Warner Mountains National Forest was added to Modoc.

They are also called hi-rail, from highway and railway, or variations such as high-rail, HiRail, Hy-rail, etc. They are often converted road vehicles, keeping their normal wheels with rubber tires, but fitted with additional flanged steel wheels for running on rails. Propulsion is typically through the conventional tires, the flanged wheels being free- rolling; the rail wheels are raised and lowered as needed. Purpose-built road‚Äìrail vehicles also exist. Certis Unimog, Road-rail vehicle used for vegetation control Overview Such vehicles are normally used for railroad right-of-way maintenance during engineering possessions of the line. They can be driven on roads to near the site and then converted to a rail vehicle for the final journey to the worksite. This avoids the complex maneuvers that would be associated with a road vehicle accessing a worksite that is not near a road. Since they are normally converted road vehicles, they would not fare well in a collision with heavy rolling stock and therefore can normally only drive on rail tracks under an engineering possession (the line is closed to normal traffic). They are generally designed to be insulated, thus they do not activate track (signaling) circuits, although some rail operators, normally those operating remote lines without boom gates, etc., prefer them to be non- insulated so that they are detectable by train safety systems.

Attempts have been made over the years to design buses and coaches that could operate on both roads and railway tracks. These attempts were never particularly successful. Some were carried out in Britain during the 1930s, on the Nickey Line by LMS, using a Ro-Railer. In Australia, the New South Wales Government Railways tried road‚Äìrail vehicles during the 1970s on New South Wales routes. The Deutsche Bundesbahn operated buses, called the ', that could be fitted with separate bogies in different areas from the 1950s to 1970s.  Road-transferable locomotive  The RTL is a semi truck with railway wheels that can be lowered when operating on the railway tracks. It was pioneered by in the early 1990s by Australian National and later refined in Victoria. The idea was to have a locomotive that could transfer from one branch line carrying mainly wheat to another parallel branch line, where the rail connection is very roundabout. The RTL suffered a number of disadvantages. Loads were severely limited when the track was steeply graded. The rubber traction wheels slipped on the steel rails when wet. The life of the rubber tires was rather short. The Canadian company Brandt has also converted large truck tractor units for use as locomotives that can move by road to where they are needed. Still mostly used for permanent way maintenance, they can also be employed as thunderbird (rescue) locomotives or even used in normal service, where they are suitable for smaller operators. In East Germany some Fortschritt ZT 300 tractors were used in road‚Äìrail service. =Shunting= Shunting vehicle UCA-TRAC B16 Road‚Äìrail vehicles are also serve as motive power for shunting, the process of sorting items of rolling stock into complete trains, or the reverse. In Belgium, the company UCA produces the UCA- TRAC, road‚Äìrail vehicles based on the chassis of a JCB Load-All (UCA-TRAC B) and JCB Fastrac (UCA-TRAC F). The UCA-TRAC provides traction through its rubber wheels and is designed to act as a rail car mover. In Australia, similar vehicles are built by Aries Rail using Volvo loaders and AUSA telehandlers. These vehicles are able to be used for other purposes such as shovelling or forklifting whilst not operating on-rail. Road‚Äìrail vehicle train brake control Such vehicles often have cabin-mounted controls for the railway air brake system so that the driver can apply and release the train brakes during shunting manoeuvres. In order to charge the train brake air hose, an air compressor needs to be fitted to the road‚Äìrail vehicle. Maintenance Montreal Metro maintenance tractor Rolling stock maintenance Self-propelled maintenance vehicles for maintenance of the track and for shunting wagons are much more convenient to use if they can transfer to the road to reposition or otherwise get out of the way. Because relatively light loads are involved, the problems plaguing the Road Transferable Locomotive are avoided. An example would be a forklift truck fitted with railway wheels and a coupling with which to shunt a wagon or two. In Belgium, the company UCA bvba has been constructing road‚Äìrail vehicles since 1981. UCA started with converting WF-trac and MB-trac for rail traction uses. They built rail car movers, shunting locotractors and other road‚Äìrail vehicles. Best known is the UCA-TRAC, based on the chassis of a JCB Load-All (UCA-TRAC B) and Fastrac (UCA-TRAC F). The UCA-TRAC provides traction through its rubber wheels. Safety issues Heavy technical assistance shunting vehicle truck with a crane and drawbar for streetcars This road‚Äìrail truck's forward rail wheels lift its forward road wheels up off the track, leaving only the two inner back wheels on the rails. Road‚Äìrail vehicles, particularly those used for inspection purposes, have been involved in a number of serious incidents, including deaths. There has been ongoing discussion regarding maintenance and inspection standards, including load and load distribution, to minimise the risk of failures. Factors leading to derailment include failed locking equipment, wheel failure, damaged rail wheel support systems, inappropriate tires, and uneven or overloading issues. In Australia, the Rail Industry Safety and Standards Board (RISSB) is working with manufacturers and operators to produce an Australian standard to which road‚Äìrail vehicles must comply. When operating in road-going mode, drivers have to remember that the dynamics of the vehicle will be changed due to the increased weight at the front and rear of the chassis. Some manufacturers have developed systems that allow the rail wheels to be stored almost entirely inside the original bodywork thus moving the centre of mass closer to the road axles. This greatly improves the on-road driving performance of the vehicle. Makes Evans Auto-Railer was a pioneer in the US in the 1930s and 1940s. Evans seems to have produced all road‚Äìrail vehicle adaptations for the U.S. military during WWII, but was rapidly overtaken by Fairmont immediately post-war. Aries Hyrail branded vehicles have been manufactured in Australia for several decades. Aries Hyrail vehicles continue to be manufactured by Aries Rail. Continental Railworks is a road-rail conversion unit manufacturer based in Montreal, Canada, producing hi-rail units since 1997. Their products are known for the automatic locking / unlocking feature and for the rubber spring induced downforce applied to the rails.

The picture was Tracy's first film in what would be a twenty-year career with MGM. Tracy plays an investigative reporter who specializes in murder cases. The film is notable as the feature film debut of James Stewart (who had previously appeared in a Shemp Howard comedy short called Art Trouble). Stewart has sixth billing as a reporter named Shorty. Plot Spencer Tracy in portrait publicizing his new MGM contract, for which The Murder Man was the first film. Steve Grey (Spencer Tracy) is a hotshot New York newspaper reporter specializing in murder. When a crooked businessman named Halford is murdered, Steve pins the blame on the dead man's associate, Henry Mander (Harvey Stephens), theorizing that Halford was killed by a rifle from a shooting gallery across the street. Mander is arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to death. Steve visits his father, who is depressed because his business has been ruined. The hard-working, hard- drinking Steve is urged by Mary (Virginia Bruce), a gossip columnist who loves him, to take some time off. Another colleague, Shorty (James Stewart), arrives to tell Steve that their editor wants an exclusive interview with Mander in prison. He goes to Sing Sing to conduct the interview. Driven by guilt, Steve shocks everyone by confessing to having committed the murder himself, as revenge for Halford and Mander having ruined his father. Steve's last act is to tell his editor that he's got his biggest story ever. Cast * Spencer Tracy as Steve Grey * Virginia Bruce as Mary * Lionel Atwill as Capt.

They pitch their coins one at a time from a mark at a given distance towards a hole in the ground. The competitors are ranked based on how close they come to the hole. The competitor closest to the hole receives all of the coins and proceeds to a second mark nearer to the hole, from which he throws all of the coins at once towards the hole. All of the coins that remain in the hole are his to keep. The remainder of the coins are given to the next closest competitor, and the process is repeated until no coins remain.The Traditional Children's Games of England Scotland & Ireland In Dictionary Form - Volume 1, Alice Bertha Gomme, 1894. A variation of the game called Chuck-Hole or Chuck- Penny was played in the same manner, with the exception that if the coins roll outside a ring drawn around the hole, it was declared a \\"dead heat,\\" and each competitor reclaims his coin. The coins used were usually small denomination, farthings, halfpence, or pennies. Sometimes rough-cast leaden markers called dumps were used.

The game is a more refined version of the coin-throwing game Pitch penny. The game itself involves throwing four brass coins or \\"toads\\" from the same distance as a dart board, to a square toad table, made of wooden legs and with a lead surface. If a toad goes down the hole it scores two points, or if it lands on the top it scores one point. If it hits the back of the table, or falls off it is void, so a grand total of eight points per turn can be scored. Scoring is performed in darts fashion, playing from 31 down. The first competitor throws two toads, with their opponent then throwing three, and from then on they throw all four, until they reach scores of less than four, wherein only the number of toads equal to the required finishing score may be thrown. Like darts, players must finish exactly - scoring more results in the player being \\"bust\\". At tournament level, participants play best of three, and best of five in the final.

The park connects certain features within the city with defensive fortifications and battle sites around it. Richmond in the American Civil War Virginia voted to secede from the United States in May 1861, and became part of the Confederacy. As a major manufacturing centre, Richmond was soon chosen to be the Confederate capital. The environs of the city would witness much combat over the next four years. Richmond National Battlefield Park occupies almost 3000 acres in the coastal plain of Virginia, bounded by the James and Chickahominy River watersheds, much of it preserved as it would have looked in the civil war, with scenic meadows and old-growth forest enabling abundant wildlife.

Although obstructed by Confederate artillery, he managed to approach within four miles of the city, but was stopped in a surprise attack by General Joseph E. Johnston. :Chicakhominy Bluffs :Trying to take Richmond, McClellan was halted by this natural defensive barrier with the river at spring flood-level, and parts of his army separated from each other by the mile-wide waterway. :Drewry's Bluff :A sharp bend on the James River, whose defensive battery was too high for the Union Navy‚Äôs guns to engage. The fleet had to withdraw, delaying McClellan‚Äôs proposed advance on Richmond. =The Seven Days Battles= (25 June - 1 July 1862) A rapid sequence of battles (sometimes reckoned as part of the Peninsula Campaign), initiated by the newly-appointed Confederate commander Robert E. Lee. McClellan soon had to retreat, but Lee failed in his plan to cut-off the Union army. :Beaver Dam Creek :Also called Mechanicsville.

It adjoins the village of Hendy in Carmarthenshire and the built-up population was 9,073. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000146 History An English translation of the name Pontarddulais is \\"Bridge over the Dulais\\", with Dulais meaning \\"black stream\\", probably due to its course through coal measures. The earlier name of Pontaberdulais referred to a dismantled 14th- century road bridge which carried the main highway between Swansea and Carmarthen over the River Loughor (Afon Llwchwr). The bridge was so named because of its position upstream of the mouth (aber) of the Dulais stream. This bridge was also known as Y Bont Fawr (\\"the big bridge\\"). The village that developed around this bridge took the shortened name of Pontardulais, also written more correctly as Pontarddulais because of the assumption that the bridge was \\"over Dulais\\". The bridge also gave the town its nickname \\"Y Bont\\". Most of the town lies within the parish of Llandeilo Tal-y-bont apart from the small section west of the bridge which lies in Llanedi parish. The bridge referred to in the name of Llandeilo Tal-y-bont (meaning \\"Saint Teilo's church at the end of the bridge\\") is not the same as that of Pontaberdulais. The church bridge was located near the old church on the earlier Roman road that crossed the river Loughor near Hendy. The medieval church of St Teilo was carefully dismantled stone-by-stone and reassembled in St Fagans National History Museum in Cardiff. Pontarddulais first gained attention in the wider world in 1843, during the Rebecca Riots, when rioters attacked the toll gate there, after crossing the bridge. The path to industrialisation began in the early 19th century. In 1839 the railway arrived in the town when the Llanelli Dock Company built a line to transport anthracite coal from the Amman Valley to Llanelli. In 1866, a new line was built connecting Pontarddulais with Swansea which made the town an important railway junction. Pontarddulais was transformed from a rural settlement into an industrial community during the years 1872 to 1910 when six tinplate works were established. The population expanded greatly during this period, as workers from nearby communities and as far afield as Italy moved in to find work in the tinplate industry. A new single-span bridge was built beside Y Bont Fawr in 1938, and the old bridge was demolished at the end of the World War II. The 1950 saw another major transformation in Pontarddulais. New, modern tinplate works in nearby Trostre and Felindre rendered the old works obsolete. The local works were taken over by other enterprises and redeveloped as light industry. However, they did not replace all the jobs lost due to the closure of the local tin plate works. Some of the local people had to find work elsewhere. Light industry gradually began deserting Pontarddulais in the late 20th century, transforming the community into a dormitory village. Education The town's schools are Pontarddulais primary school, Pontarddulais Comprehensive School (both English medium) and Bryniago School, a Welsh medium primary school. Transport Pontarddulais railway station is on the Heart of Wales Line, with trains to Swansea to the south and Shrewsbury to the north. The A48 traverses the town as St Teilo Street and Bolgoed Road. Junction 48 of the M4 Motorway serves Pontarddulais. Media and culture Pontarddulais hosts many cultural events throughout the year, including Pontarddulais and Hendy carnival, which makes its way from Hendy Industrial Estate to Coed Bach Park in Pontarddulais on the last Saturday of June. Also held in the town is Pontarddulais Show, an agricultural show held on August Bank Holiday, and the Classic Car and Motor Show, held in September, both of which take place at Pontarddulais Agricultural Show Ground. Pontarddulais is home to C√¥r Meibion Pontarddulais or Pontarddulais Male Choir, the most successful competitive choir in Wales, having won the main choir prize at the Welsh National Eisteddfod a record 15 times and the International Eisteddfod prize on two occasions.Pontarddulais Male Choir official site The choir also performed choral parts in the Pink Floyd film The Wall. and recorded with Roger Waters on his hit single \\"The Tide is Turning\\". Pontarddulais is also home to Pontardulais Town Band. The band has many national and local accolades, and is one of the oldest town brass bands in Wales. The band continues to support local events, such as the Hendy and Pontarddulais carnival, and Remembrance Day Parades. Pontardulais Town Band won the Championship Section at the South East Wales Brass Band Association contest on 21 November 2009, held in the Blaenavon Workingmen's Hall. It was the first time for over 50 years that the Pontardulais Town Band has won a Class A or championship contest in Wales. The last time the band was ranked Class A was in 1958 when they represented Wales at the National Finals playing Variations on a Shining River, arranged by Frank Wright. The band finished the year joint runners-up in the championship section for the 2009 competitive year. In March 2010 the band competed in the Welsh Regional Championships in the Brangwyn Hall in Swansea and they attained 1st place in the first section resulting in them qualifying for the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain. The band's current musical director is Paul Jenkins. Some well-known literary figures have associations with Pontarddulais, including Edward Thomas and Dylan Thomas, who had several aunts and uncles in the town. It has been suggested that Dylan based part of his filmscript, Rebecca's Daughters, on the riots in the Bont. His lifelong friend, Wynford Vaughan Thomas, was the grandson of Daniel Lewis, one of the Rebecca leaders.From Fountain to River: Dylan Thomas and the Bont by D. John and D.N.

He emigrated in 1946 to the United States and received his music training at the New England Conservatory and Columbia University. Chou is credited by Nicolas Slonimsky as one of the first Chinese composers who attempted to translate authentic oriental melo-rhythms into the terms of modern Western music.Peter Chang, Chou Wen-Chung: the Life and Work of a Contemporary Chinese-born American Composer (Oxford, U.K: The Scarecrow Press, 2006), 34. Life =Early years in China= Chou was born in Yantai (Chefoo), Shandong. He grew up in China and developed an early love for music. (\\"Sights and Sounds\\" is an essay by Chou on early influences on his music.) Qin music, in particular, has proved fertile ground for his future exploration. Chou described his early explorations of musical instruments: > While in Qingdao, I first discovered the meaning of music in life when I > heard our household help enjoying their free time by playing instruments, > singing, and drinking. I also became fascinated with harmonium pedals, which > I played with at first as a car accelerator, and then discovered their > dynamic effect... However, it was in Wuhan that I discovered the violin when > my older brothers and I bought a child-size violin as a toy. My oldest > brother, Wen-tsing, immediately began taking lessons and recruited me as his > ‚Äústudent‚Äù! I played the erhu, studied the violin and taught myself a medley > of instruments, such as mandolin, harmonica and musical saw.Wen-Chung Chou, > ‚ÄúChou Wen-Chung Official Site,‚Äù Chou Wen-Chung, accessed Sep 20, 2013, > http://www.chouwenchung.org/biography/early_p2.php . During the Second World War, he was persuaded to study civil engineering to help modernize China. After high school, Chou studied Architecture at Saint John's University, Shanghai in China. Chou stated in his biography, ‚ÄúI chose architecture as a compromise between art and science, largely influenced by John Ruskin‚Äôs comment on architecture as ‚Äòfrozen music.‚Äô ‚ÄùWen-Chung Chou, ‚ÄúChou Wen-Chung Official Site,‚Äù Chou Wen-Chung, accessed Sep 20, 2013, http://www.chouwenchung.org/biography/early_p4.php Within one semester, Chou's study was interrupted because of the breakout of World War II and Chou had to relocate and continued his study in Guangxi University and Chongqing University. Chou attended Guangxi University during 1942‚Äì44 and managed to find time to compose music on his own and to educate himself about western culture through reading library books despite the nightly air raids and his civil engineering study. Chou had to move again in 1944 and continued his study in Chongqing University where he received his B.S. degree in civil engineering. =Turning point ‚Äì Music study and teaching in the United States= In 1946, Chou turned down a scholarship in architecture at Yale University in order to pursue music, studying with Nicolas Slonimsky at the New England Conservatory and with Edgard Var√®se and Otto Luening in New York. In a conversation with Frank J. Oteri published on NewMusicBox in 2013, Chou described the difficulties he had at that time: > For more than a week, I stayed in my room. I couldn‚Äôt make up my mind > whether I really wanted to continue with this scholarship. Can you believe > it? The only way I could come to this country was to get a scholarship to > Yale and register as a student. So I went to see the dean, saying I had > decided not to [continue].

If he has to, let him.Frank J. Oteri, \\"Chou > Wen-Chung: Living with History\\" (NewMusicBox, March 1, 2013). Chou studied composition with Otto Luening at Columbia University and from 1949‚Äì1954, took lessons privately with Edgard Var√®se who became a lifelong mentor and friend. Synthesizing western and eastern sounds has been a pursuit of Chou's throughout his life. During his early compositional years in New York, one experience changed Chou's perspective on how to incorporate different cultural elements. Peter Chang described this incident in details: > On one occasion, Chou showed his Chinese-flavored fugues to Bohuslav > Martin≈Ø, who started to read them on the piano and suddenly stopped after a > few measures. He looked at Chou and simply uttered one word: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Chou > could not answer. Such an embarrassment disturbed him profoundly and made > him realize that substituting pentatonic for heptatonic modes in fugue, > which had been developed in the heptatonic and triadic tradition, was like > putting Chinese words into Bach‚Äôs mouth. Fugue was Bach‚Äôs natural language, > but not his. Chou believed that this was one of the greatest lessons he ever > had because, beginning with the word ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù he had to satisfy his own > questions before moving on.Peter Chang, Chou Wen-Chung: the Life and Work of > a Contemporary Chinese-born American Composer (Oxford, U.K: The Scarecrow > Press, 2006), 25. After that experience and through encouragement from Slonimsky, Chou decided not to seek the artificial combination of Chinese melody and western harmony but instead to study Chinese music and culture seriously. Chou's encounter with Western culture helped him see and appreciate his own culture in new light. To re-learn and to interpret his own tradition, in 1955, Chou spent two years researching classical Chinese music and drama with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1958. Slonimsky commented on how Chou successfully fused two seemingly incompatible musical materials and wrote: When pentatonic melodies of the Orient are harmonized in this conventional manner, the incompatibility between the melody and the harmonic setting is such that the very essence of Oriental melody is destroyed. Even more difficult is the representation of microtonal intervals peculiar to some countries of the Orient .. Chou Wen-Chung is possibly the first Chinese composer who has attempted to translate authentic oriental melo- rhythms into the terms of modern Western music... He poses the problem of conciliation between melodic pentatonicism and dissonance.Peter Chang, Chou Wen-Chung: the Life and Work of a Contemporary Chinese-born American Composer (Oxford, U.K: The Scarecrow Press, 2006), 34. Academic career In 1954, he became the first technical assistant at Columbia's Electronic Music Laboratory and was concurrently appointed director of a research project on Chinese music and drama. This research reinforced his own aesthetic convictions and led him to synthesize theories of calligraphy, qin, single tones and I Ching, all of which represented new ground in his compositional thinking. As chairman of the Music Division at Columbia University, he was instrumental in providing its composition program with a clear sense of artistic vision. Chou also distinguished himself as vice-dean of the School of the Arts and director of the Fritz Reiner Center for Contemporary Music at Columbia University. His notable students include Zhou Long, Chen Yi, Tan Dun, Chinary Ung, David Froom, Ge Gan-ru, Bright Sheng, James Tenney, Jing Jing Luo, Michael Rosenzweig, Faye-Ellen Silverman, Jacques-Louis Monod, and Hsiung-Zee Wong. Career as cultural ambassador In 1978, Chou Wen-chung established the Center for US-China Arts Exchange at Columbia University to promote mutual understanding between the two countries through the channel of culture. It was the first organization to address the need to re-connect leaders in the arts in China and the United States after diplomatic ties had been severed for thirty years. The Center organized exchanges in both directions. Distinguished artists including violinist Isaac Stern, playwright Arthur Miller, writer Susan Sontag and choreographer Alwin Nikolais visited China while prominent cultural figures from China such as playwright Cao Yu and actor Ying Ruocheng visited the U.S. Among the many projects was a six-year ongoing program in arts education led by Howard Gardner of Project Zero at Harvard University. In the 1990s the Center's purview expanded to include programs focused on the arts of ethnic nationalities in Yunnan province and relevant issues of environmental preservation. Music career He was a prot√©g√© of the composer Edgard Var√®se. Chou sought in his music not simply to propagate Var√®sian concepts, but to move beyond his teacher's shadow. From Var√®se's purely Western tradition, Chou's music evolved from cross-cultural pollination, integrating the East and the West, with the requisite understanding of both cultures. He can be regarded as the founder of the contemporary Chinese musical idiom, one whose music sets the standard and an example for succeeding generations to emulate. Chou's revolutionary insights brought about a broader and more integrated perception of Chinese music by scholars and laymen East and West. He recognized the intrinsic contribution of qin music and the single tone concept to Chinese music, and more importantly, he recognized their value to composers. (\\"The Twain Meet\\" by Leighton Kerner.) Also important to his music was the refinement of individual pitches. He believed the West has mastered formal structures, whereas the East remains ineffective in controlling subtle inflections of tones. By emulating Western achievement in formal design, he employed these nuances not as mere decoration, but as a clear structural element. The art of calligraphy, in its various levels of meaning, serves constantly as the music's philosophical underpinning. A controlled spontaneity and quiet intensity derived from an intimate knowledge of his art and his culture, together with a growth process as organic and inevitable as that of nature, remain requisite stylistic elements. Ultimately, he sought not so much to amalgamate the divergent Eastern and Western traditions as to internalize and transcend contemporary idioms and techniques to create an intimately personal style that reflects a genuine, modern sensibility. (\\"Chou Wen-chung\\" by Nicolas Slonimsky) Chou wrote for a variety of media. His works have been performed by the orchestras of Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, San Francisco, Berlin, Paris, and Tokyo. He received grants from the Rockefeller, Guggenheim and Koussevitsky Foundations, from the National Institute of the Arts and Letters, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the New York State Council on the Arts. He was the Fritz Reiner Professor Emeritus of Musical Composition at Columbia University (where he was also Director of the Center for US-China Arts Exchange), and a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He was composer-in- residence at Tanglewood, Bennington and the University of Illinois. His posts in music organizations included the presidency of Composers Recordings, Inc. (CRI) and the chair of the Editorial Board of Asian Music. He was also an honorary life member of the Asian Composers League. Other contemporary music organizations with which he was affiliated included League ISCM, the Yaddo Corporation, the American Composers Alliance, the American Music Center, and the American Society of University Composers.(condensed from David Tsang) Chou Wen-chung was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and in 2001, he was named Officier des Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. In 2018, the Xinghai Conservatory of Music in Guangzhou opened the Chou Wen-chung Music Research Center to carry on the composer's legacy and initiate projects in support of contemporary music. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the New England Conservatory in 2019.https://necmusic.edu/news/nec-presents-composer-chou-wen-chung-honorary- doctorate Composition styles and developments =Early period= Chou's early works share common characteristics such as the use of Chinese poetry as inspiration and the direct quotation of Chinese melodies. Representative compositions from this period are Landscapes (1949), All in the Spring Wind (1952‚Äì1953), And the Fallen Petals (1954), and Willow Are New (1957). Chou quoted a traditional folk song Fengyang Flower Drum in Landscapes and this orchestral piece is inspired by poems that evoke the scenery and atmosphere of a Chinese landscape painting. These poems ‚ÄúUnder the Cliff, in the Bay,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Sorrow of Parting‚Äù and ‚ÄúOne Streak of Dying Light‚Äù are used as subtitles to indicate the moods of different sections in Landscape. Chinese scholars traditionally inscribe poetry in a painting and many of Chou's early compositions have inscriptions from ancient Chinese poems.Eric Chiu Kong Lai, The Music of Chou Wen-chung (Burlington: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2009), 27. Chinese poetry served as inspiration for And the Fallen Petals, and All in the Spring Wind. Both works are based on a Southern Tang dynasty poem titled ‚ÄúYi Jiangnan ‚Äì Reminiscence of Southern Territories‚Äù by Li Yu. Peter Chang commented that through these early works, Chou developed a mode of musical thinking in terms of Chinese visual and literary artistic principles such as the emphasis on the control of ink flow in calligraphy, brevity in landscape paintings, poetry in musical form, and pictorial depiction of the qin playing gestures. =Mature period= In this period, Chou's inspirational source came from the philosophical book, the I Ching (Book of Changes), the contents of which he said represent ‚Äúthe germinal elements of all that happens in the universe, including natural phenomena, human affairs, and ideas.‚ÄùWen-Chung Chou, Metaphors (New York: C. F. Peters, 1961). Based on the yin and yang concepts presented in I Ching, Chou created variable modes ‚Äì a system of interval contents and pitch contents that correspond to the trigrams and hexagrams in I Ching. Chou applied and experimented with the principles of the I-Ching in harmonic, thematic, textural, and rhythmic structures.Peter Chang, Chou Wen-Chung: the Life and Work of a Contemporary Chinese-born American Composer (Oxford, U.K: The Scarecrow Press, 2006), 93. Beginning in the late 1950s, Chou began to experiment with variable modes in his compositions. Jianjun He classified Chou's works into two categories: ‚Äúpentatonic-related‚Äù or ‚Äúvariable modes-based‚Äù composition.He Jianjun, Zhou Wenzhong de ‚ÄúCao Shu‚Äù (Hunan, China: Hunan University, 2004), 2‚Äì3. Most of Chou's early works are pentatonic-related and Chou drew his inspirations from traditional Chinese pentatonic melodies. The piece metaphor (1960) marks the beginning of Chou's middle period when Chou utilized the variable modes as a compositional method to pitch organization. Later, Chou applied the modes to other works such as Cursive (1963), Pien (1966), and Yun (1969).Peter Chang, Chou Wen-Chung: the Life and Work of a Contemporary Chinese-born American Composer (Oxford, U.K: The Scarecrow Press, 2006), 37. Chou stated that the structure of Pien is based on the concept of balance between the positive and the negative forces as stated in I-Ching.Chew Seok-Kwee, ‚ÄúAn Analysis of the Selected Music of Chou Wen-Chung in Relation to Chinese Aesthetics‚Äù (PhD diss., New York University, 1990), 72. Ideogram is another evolutionary concept Chou experimented with while attempting to synthesize western and eastern elements and render Chinese sounds through western instruments. Chou is an accomplished calligrapher and after years of practicing the various styles and scripts of Chinese calligraphic writings, Chou began to see the parallels in the art of calligraphy and music. Chou wrote, ‚ÄúThe cursive script represents the essence in the art of Chinese calligraphy as its expressiveness depends solely upon the spontaneous but controlled flow of ink which, through the brush ‚Äì strokes, projects not only fluid lines in interaction but also density, texture and poise.... These qualities, translated into musical terms are often found in the music for wind and string instruments of the east.He Jianjun, Zhou Wenzhong de ‚ÄúCao Shu‚Äù (Hunan, China: Hunan University, 2004), 42. Chou compares the ink flow to the density of the music and experimented with the ideograms of cursive style writing in the piece Cursive in 1963. Chou's later works moved toward abstraction and he further developed the variable mode to make it more flexible.Peter Chang, Chou Wen-Chung: the Life and Work of a Contemporary Chinese-born American Composer (Oxford, U.K: The Scarecrow Press, 2006), 117. Some notable compositions are Beijing in the Mist (1986), Echoes from the Gorge (1996), Windswept Peaks (1994), Concerto for Violincello and Orchestra (1991), and Clouds (1998). Chou wrote his second string quartet, Streams (2003) in response to Bach's Art of Fugue, which was commissioned by the Brentano String Quartet. In 2007, the gayageum master, Yi Ji-young, commissioned him to write a work for gayageum and an ensemble of traditional Korean instruments. Her group, Contemporary Music Ensemble of Korea (CMEK) premiered Eternal Pine in 2008. Chou wrote a version for western instruments, Ode to Eternal Pine (2009), for the New York New Music Ensemble (NYNME) and a version for traditional Chinese instruments, Sizhu Eternal Pine (2012; his first and only work for a full ensemble of Chinese instruments), for the Taipei Chinese Orchestra. Personal life Chou Wen-chung was born into a literati family with ancestral roots in the ancient cultural center of Changzhou in Jiangsu province. His older brother, Wen Tsing Chow pioneered the use of digital computers in missile, satellite and spacecraft guidance systems for the United States Air Force and NASA. Chou Wen-chung married Chang Yi-an (born Shanghai in 1927, died April 12, 2016) in 1962.

The pillar of the Civil system is the Constitution of Argentina (1853). The Argentine Constitution of 1853 was an attempt to unite the unstable and young country of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata under a single law, creating as well the different organisms needed to run a country. This constitution was finally approved after failed attempts in 1813 (see Assembly of 1813), 1819 and 1831 (Pacto Federal). Judicial system Justice is administered by both federal and provincial courts. The former deal only with cases of a national character or those to which different provinces or inhabitants of different provinces are parties. The Supreme Court, which supervises and regulates all other federal courts, is composed of nine members nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Other federal courts include nine appellate courts, with three judges for each; single judge district courts, at least one for each province; and one-judge territorial courts. The federal courts may not decide political questions. Judges of the lower courts are appointed by the president. Provincial courts include supreme courts, appellate courts, courts of first instance, and minor courts of justices of the peace (alcaldes) and of market judges. Members of provincial courts are appointed by the provincial governors. Trial by jury was authorized by the 1853 constitution for criminal cases, but its establishment was left to the discretion of congress, resulting in sporadic use. A 1991 law provides a fund for compensating prisoners who were illegally detained during the 1976‚Äì83 military dictatorship. In 1992 a system of oral public trials was instituted to speed up the judicial process while improving the protection of procedural rights of criminal defendants. In 1989 President Carlos Menem, in a court-packing maneuver, expanded the number of Supreme Court justices from five to nine. In 2003, shortly after taking office, President N√©stor Kirchner signaled his intention to remove some of Menem‚Äôs appointees and to strengthen the judiciary by undoing some of Menem's moves that turned the Supreme Court into a political ally of the president rather than an autonomous power of the state. Formal and informal constitutional accusation against Menem-appointed Supreme Court justices between 2003 and 2005 allowed Kirchner to appoint new justices. He also issued a degree limiting the powers of the president of the republic to appoint judges to the Supreme Court. The constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home or correspondence. The government respects these provisions. The constitution prohibits torture; however, in practice police brutality remains a serious problem. The judicial system is subject to delays, resulting in lengthy pretrial detention.

Early life Galanos was born September 20, 1924, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only son of Greek-born parents. His mother, Helen Gorgoliatos, and his father, Gregory Galanos, a frustrated artist, ran a restaurant in southern New Jersey, where Galanos had his first glimpses of well-dressed women. He grew up a shy boy and learned to work hard from an early age. Galanos recalled that he was \\"a loner, surrounded by three sisters. I never sewed; I just sketched. It was simply instinctive. As a young boy I had no fashion influences around me but all the while I was dreaming of Paris and New York.\\" Galanos graduated from Bridgeton High School in Bridgeton, New Jersey in 1942 and went to New York City intending to enroll at a school headed by Barbara Karinska, the great Russian stage designer and costumer. When the school failed to open in the autumn, he enrolled at the Traphagen School of Fashion, one of the first schools of its kind. He attended two semesters at Traphagen, the first spent in general design studies and the second in draping and construction. After eight months, in 1943, Galanos left the school because he felt that what he wanted to learn could only be acquired from practical experience in the garment industry.Bradley, Barry. Galanos, Cleveland: Western Reserve Historical Society, 1996. . Retrieved March 9, 2011. Career =1944 ‚Äì mid-1950s= In 1944, Galanos got a position as a general assistant at the New York East 49th Street emporium of Hattie Carnegie, the incubator of such talents as Jean Louis, Pauline Trig√®re, and Norman Norell. His job there turned out to be more clerical than creative, and, disappointed, Galanos left Carnegie and began selling his sketches to individual manufacturers on Seventh Avenue for less than $10.00 per sketch. Then, in 1945, his former Traphagen style and fashion teacher Elisabeth Rorabach called his attention to a help-wanted ad she had seen in The New York Times, placed by textile magnate Lawrence Lesavoy. \\"His beautiful wife, Joan, was hoping to launch a ready-to-wear dress business in California, and they were looking for a designer,\\" recalled Galanos. The Lesavoys employed him for $75.00 a week and dispatched him to Los Angeles. Their plan, however, did not materialize; the Lesavoys divorced, and Galanos lost his job. \\"Out of pity,\\" Galanos said, Jean Louis, head costume designer at Columbia Pictures, hired him as a part-time assistant sketch artist. Soon afterward, Lawrence Lesavoy agreed to send the 24-year-old Galanos to Paris, just as couture houses there were rebounding from the war. Couturier Robert Piguet absorbed the American into his stable of assistants, among whom were Pierre Balmain, Hubert de Givenchy, and Marc Bohan.Collins, Amy Fine. \\"When Galanos spelled Glamour,\\" Vanity Fair, April 2007, U.S. Retrieved March 8, 2011. At the Piguet atelier, Galanos met with fabric and trimming suppliers to choose materials, sketched and draped up designs under the eye of Piguet, who oversaw his work on a daily basis. In 1948, Galanos decided to return to the U.S and accepted a job with Davidow, a dress-making firm in New York. The new job allowed him very little creativity, and he resigned shortly. In 1951, James Galanos decided to take another shot at California, and when the opportunity arose for him to open his own company, Galanos Originals, in 1952, he created a small collection, which was immediately ordered by Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills. He then opened his New York showroom where a Neiman Marcus clothing buyer discovered him and predicted his styles would soon \\"set the world on fire.\\" Stanley Marcus, the president of Neiman Marcus, agreed and soon proclaimed that the greatest and most treasured luxury in the world for a woman to have would be a dress by James Galanos. Legendary magazine editors and style arbiters such as Diana Vreeland, Eleanor Lambert and Eugenia Sheppard became fans, ensuring that he would become a household name within months. From this first collection, his clothing has been admired for its particularly high quality, especially considering it was ready-to-wear, not custom-made. His chiffon dresses, in particular, made his reputation in the early 1950s, with their yards of meticulously hand-rolled edges. Many designers worked with chiffon, but Galanos was a true master of the genre. He draped chiffon, pleated it, layered it, used flower prints and fabrics with metallic glints. As tailored as a shirtwaist dress or as seductive as a sarong, he gave chiffon a high style all his own. Sometimes he even gilded it, as in his notable pin-striped dress with a three-dimensional jeweled butterfly embroidered on the chest. In 1953, Galanos embarked on another venture altogether ‚Äì he began designing for movies. His first job was to create costumes for Rosalind Russell, the star of the forthcoming film \\"Never Wave at a WAC.\\" Russell, who at that time was considered the best-dressed of all American actresses, loved Galanos' designs, and she became his friend and a loyal client. Galanos went on to design costumes for other Russell's movies, most notably the film version of Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad in 1967. After her death, Miss Russell's wardrobe ‚Äì nearly all of it Galanos ‚Äì was divided among a number of costume collections across the country as gifts in her memory from her husband, Frederick Brisson. Other Galanos' contributions to film and performing arts included costume designs for Judy Garland for General Electric Theater and Judy Garland Musical Special, both in 1956, as well as the 1974 film Ginger in the Morning, starring Sissy Spacek. =Mid-1950s ‚Äì 1998= PFF collection, Nafplion Galanos gathered some of the most talented craftsmen available in his workrooms; many were trained in Europe or in the costume studios of Hollywood, for whom he continued to design from time to time. Nondas Keramitsis, Galanos' head tailor, moved to Los Angeles from his native Greece to make women's clothing. He had heard about Galanos through relatives and soon started working with him in his Los Angeles studio. Keramitsis and a crew of about 22 tailors he oversaw made everything by hand. If Galanos' work was compared to that of anyone else, it was compared to French haute couture. His business was more comparable to a couture house than a ready-to-wear manufacturer; there was a great amount of hand work in each garment, and all of his famous beadwork and embroidery was done by his staff. Galanos always chose fabrics and trimmings personally during trips to Europe and Asia. Though he constantly looked for the best fabrics, Galanos often felt compelled to create his own. So he would make jackets out of different colored ribbons to toss over his chiffon dresses in impressionist colors. Or he would cross black satin ribbons over black lace for the bodices of delicately frothy short evening dresses. He often lined his dresses with silks that other designers used for dresses themselves, and he was always a firm believer in the importance of hidden details. These details made a difference in the feel of the clothes on the body and the hang of the fabric, and his clients all over the world were willing to pay a great deal for them. Details that were not hidden included sequins, feathers, metallic brocades, and laces. He often balanced his most glittering dresses with quiet tie-dyed velvet sheaths and long, clingy styles in black crepe or crushed velvet. \\"Galanos: Perfection, and Lots of It,\\" read the headline in The New York Times after Galanos' show of some 200 designs in 1988. \\"While he travels to Europe for his fabrics ‚Äì many are the same as those used in the Paris couture collections ‚Äì most of Galanos's designing is done in California,\\" reported the Times. \\"His standards are as high as those found anywhere in the world. If a comparison is made, it is usually with the Paris couture. It is reasonably astonishing that an American designer of ready-to-wear should merit that kind of homage over so long a period of time.\\" Fashion designer Gustave Tassell, a long-time friend of Galanos, recalls an occasion when Hubert de Givenchy, the illustrious French couturier, was looking at an inside of a Galanos garment and exclaimed \\"... we don't make them this well in Paris!\\" It was precisely this couture quality and the timelessness of Galanos' designs that caused his clients to never part with their gowns and continue wearing them over many years. But it was also the price tag. \\"Nobody could afford to dress completely with Jimmy,\\" Nancy Reagan once confessed. \\"I hang on to what I have.\\" Vogue magazine in the Red Room, 1981 Galanos was also famous for his exquisite furs. He used mainly mink, sable, lynx, and broadtail and handled the furs imaginatively as if they were fabric. He smocked and quilted the surfaces, nipped the waistlines and used drawstrings, ruffles, and capelets to give a strong fashion slant to all that opulence. He often designed for Peter Dion, the furrier who made sure that the quality of the pelts and the workmanship supported the innovative design. At the top of the line were coats made of lynx bellies, so soft and fluffy they looked airborne. The short style was selling for $200,000, the long one ‚Äì for $300,000. The fitted coat was a Galanos specialty, successful in almost any fur, including fox. As he did with his ready-to-wear, Galanos also made the hats and other accessories, which included short fur scarves with mink tails hanging from the ends. He showed his coats over stretch tights and bodysuits with satin surfaces. There were unexpected styles as well, like fur shorts, gathered down the sides. Many sleeves featured the smock quilting that became a Galanos signature. He also had a special feeling for broadtail, the tissue-thin fur with a sleek, elegant surface. But Galanos could also make soft mink coats look lean, willowy and graceful by the way he shaped the skins in the back or carved the hemline in a back-dipping curve. According to Bernardine Morris of the New York Times, Galanos' \\"best design is a slender coat with the skins worked vertically through the bodice and horizontally for the skirt, an example of elegant proportioning.\\" Many of the world's most socially prominent women were Galanos customers. \\"James Galanos designs for wealthy women who go to luncheons and cocktail parties, dine at the finest restaurants and are invited to the best parties,\\" reported The New York Times. \\"His clothes are rarely seen in business offices. It isn't only because of the five-figure price tags, although they are daunting to all but the highest-paid executives. It's also the glamour quotient of the clothes.\\" Galanos agreed, \\"I design for a very limited group of people,\\" he told Time magazine in 1985. In the 1980s, he made national headlines as First Lady Nancy Reagan's favorite designer. The fact that Mrs. Reagan wore a 14-year-old Galanos gown to her first state dinner at the White House attested to the timelessness and durability not only of his workmanship, but more importantly, of his design. This type of occurrence was commonplace among his faithful customers, who included Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Jackie Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, Grace Kelly, Diana Ross, Betsy Bloomingdale, Rosalind Russell, Marlene Dietrich, Dorothy Lamour, Judy Garland, Loretta Young, Ali MacGraw, Ivana Trump, Carolyne Roehm, Kim Basinger, Arianna Huffington and many other notable personalities and film and media stars. In 1982, John Duka, the New York Times columnist, described in his column, Notes on Fashion, a black tie party in Galanos' honor attended by his A-list fans, \\"James Galanos, the designer whose clothing is unmatched in quality and price in this country, was in town, and almost immediately the level of social exchange seemed elevated as if by ripple effect. Betsy and Michael Kaiser ‚Äì he is the photographer ‚Äì gave a black tie buffet dinner for the designer Saturday. Among those at table were Lyn Revson, Gordon Parks, Barbara Walters, Arianna Stassinopoulos, former Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff and his wife, Casey, Freddie and Arlette Brisson, Mary McFadden, Tammy Grimes, Stephen Paley, John Loring, Gloria Vanderbilt, William Macomber, Sybilla Clark, Alex Gregory, Frank and Gloria Schiff and Bob Colacello. Mr. Galanos was the center of attention: Almost every woman in the room was wearing one of his designs.\\" =1998 ‚Äì 2016= Despite his retirement in 1998, Galanos continued to make his presence known in the fashion world. In 2002, he blasted the fashion industry for catering to only young women with perfect bodies. In an interview with WWD over lunch at the Pierre Hotel in New York he asked the reporter, Eric Wilson, shaking his head in contempt, \\"How many women can wear just a patch over their crotch and a bra? Aren't you embarrassed when you see a young girl walking down the street practically naked? Fashion is geared only to young people today,\\" Galanos continued. \\"All we see is Levi's and bare bellies to the point of nausea. There are no clothes for elegant women. Let's face it, some of the things you see in the paper are absolutely monstrous looking ‚Äì and I'm not squeamish. God knows I made sexy clothes in my day, but there's a point when you have to say, 'Enough, already'.\\"Wilson, Eric. \\"GALANOS: OUT OF HIS SHELL,\\" Women's Wear Daily, June 11, 2002, U.S. Retrieved March 8, 2011. Of contemporary designers, he admired the work of Ralph Rucci, who shares Galanos' views of the state of fashion at the beginning of the new millennium. \\"I think we're in a state of mediocrity,\\" Rucci told design students at the San Francisco Academy of Art University. Beginning in the early 2000s, Galanos attended most of Rucci's shows in New York and Paris. \\"I thought what he was doing was really terrific,\\" Galanos told Cathy Horyn of The New York Times in 2002, \\"he has the same kind of concept that I had ‚Äì beautiful details that you don't see in ready-to-wear.\\" \\"Ralph Rucci makes clothes like no one else, taking pains to make things that are beautifully finished,\\" he told Harper's Bazaar in 2004.Middleton, Wiliaml (April 2004). \\"The Rise of Ralph Rucci.\\", Harper's Bazaar, U.S. Retrieved March 8, 2011. On his side, Rucci considers Galanos a major influence in his work and a continuing inspiration. \\"If we were in Japan, we'd have an expression and call [Galanos] our national living treasure,\\" Rucci told a group of distinguished guests that included Nancy Reagan, Betsy Bloomingdale and Peggy Moffitt, at an event honoring Galanos at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. \\"While he officially retired in 1998,\\" wrote Alix Browne in The New York Times, \\"he shows no signs of falling out of fashion.\\" Galanos's vintage gowns remain chic, sought after and popular among the international jet-set, Hollywood stars and supermodels, and have been seen on such notable women as Celine Dion, Ren√©e Zellweger, Nicole Kidman, Jessica Alba, Heidi Klum, Tatiana Sorokko, Amber Valletta, Christina Ricci, Ashley Olsen and Katie Holmes, among many others. =Photography= Having reinvented himself as an abstract photographer, in 2006, at age 82, Galanos's first exhibition of photography was held to great acclaim at the Serge Sorokko Gallery in San Francisco. The show featured more than 40 photographs taken by Galanos over the previous several years. The works were mostly abstract, with the notable exception of a few mystical, mirror-effect enigmatic landscapes. Much like fashion design, his photography revolved around material, shape and color. The subjects were crafted by Galanos out of paper or fabric and then photographed in evocative light, creating subtle variations of tone and shading. =Awards and recognition= PFF collection, Nafplion Galanos was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1982. He won a host of awards during his career, including the Coty Fashion Award in both 1954 and 1956. He was inducted into the Coty Hall of Fame in 1959. His other honors included the Crystal Ball Award from The Fashion Group of Philadelphia, 1963; the Fashion Award from the Drexel Institute of Technology, 1965; the London Sunday Times International Award, 1968; the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Golden 44 Award, 1980; a Diploma di Merita from the Universita delle Arte Terme, Italy, 1981. Galanos also received the prestigious Council of Fashion Designers of America Lifetime Achievement Award in 1985. In the year 2000, the City of New York began honoring American fashion designers by placing bronze plaques along the pavement of Seventh Avenue. Dubbed the \\"Fashion Walk of Fame\\", Galanos was one of the first designers to be so honored. In 2007, he became the recipient of the Rodeo Drive Walk of Style Award, and one year later, in 2008, he received a Doctor of Philosophy degree honoris causa from the San Francisco Academy of Art University. Galanos was the subject of numerous museum solo exhibitions, and his designs are in the permanent collections of important museums worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Victoria and Albert Museum in London, U.K, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, in Los Angeles, Mus√©e Galliera in Paris, France, the Phoenix Art Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, the Philadelphia Museum of Art in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC, the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, N.Y., the Brooklyn Museum in Brooklyn, N.Y. and the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco, California, to name a few. Galanos' career spanned more than half a century. \\"To James Galanos, fashion is all about making women look beautiful,\\" wrote Anne-Marie Schiro in The New York Times, \\"and he has devoted 44 years of his life to designing clothes to that end.\\" He \\"was always a hero to all those who worshiped at the feet of fashion, not just those who wore the clothes\\", wrote Bernardine Morris in an introduction to the catalogue of Galanos' retrospective exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1996. \\"He was heralded as the equal of any of the mythic group of French designers who represented the apotheosis of fashion. The difference, then and now, is that Galanos' clothes were ready-to-wear; the French Haute Couture made custom clothes. In this, he is truly an American designer. For, in this country, it is ready-to-wear that dominates fashion, a lesson the French learned after he pointed the way. This may be James Galanos' major contribution to the fashion world: he brought brilliance and quality to styles meant to be bought off the rack\\"Morris, Bernardine. Galanos, Cleveland: Western Reserve Historical Society, 1996. . Retrieved March 9, 2011. Personal life Galanos never married. He was the uncle of fine jewelry designer Diana Vincent, of Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania. He retired in 1998 and lived in Palm Springs, California and West Hollywood.

Its first version was written in 1853 by a constitutional assembly which gathered in Santa Fe; the doctrinal basis was taken in part from the United States Constitution. It was then reformed in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957 (which mainly repealed the 1949 reform), and the current version is the reformed text of 1994. History Juan Bautista Alberdi, the legal scholar who drafted the 1853 Constitution. The first attempt to divide political power in Argentina was during the government created after the May Revolution (Spanish: Revoluci√≥n de Mayo): the Primera Junta could not create new taxes without the Cabildo's authorization. Many revolutionary leaders, led by Mariano Moreno, wanted to declare independence immediately and create a constitution in order to build an independent state. In October 1811, the Junta Grande, which succeeded the Primera Junta, enacted the Regulation for the Division of Power, but it was not accepted by the executive power. Nevertheless, the freedom of press and the Decree on Individual Security were accepted by November. In 1813, the General Constitutional Assembly was intended to declare a constitution but it could only declare the freedom for slaves' sons. In 1819 and 1826 were declared two constitutions that eventually failed because of the disagreement between Federalists and Unitarians. Many other constitutional pacts existed between 1820 and 1853 (when the current Argentine Constitution was enacted). The most important of them are: the Treaty of Pilar (1820), the Treaty of the Cuadril√°tero (1822), the Federal Pact (1831), the Palermo Protocol (1852), and the Treaty of San Nicol√°s (1852). The Federal Pact urged all the provinces to call a General Federal Congress, however this would have limited Juan Manuel de Rosas's power who was the most powerful province governor, so the Congress was never called. When Rosas was defeated, in 1852, the Treaty of San Nicol√°s finally called the Constitutional Congress that, in Santa Fe, on May 1, 1853, sworn to make effective the federal Constitution. Consequently, the Province of Buenos Aires left the Argentine Confederation until 1859. =Reforms to the 1853 Constitution= The first constitutional amendment to the original 1853 text occurred in 1860 after Buenos Aires rejoined the Argentine Confederation. It consisted of changes to many of the original articles. One of the major changes was the renaming of the state: according to the reform, the country would be officially named Rep√∫blica Argentina (\\"Argentine Republic\\") and, for legal purposes, Naci√≥n Argentina (\\"Argentine Nation\\"), replacing the older \\"Argentine Confederation\\" in all articles of the constitution. Another important inclusion was the constitutional recognition of Buenos Aires' exclusive rights guaranteed by the Treaty of San Nicol√°s. The next reform occurred in 1866 and established that exportation and importation taxes would be destined to the National Treasury indefinitely, no longer until 1866 as the 1860 reform had established. In 1898, another minor constitutional amendment was approved. It allowed a more flexible ratio for proportional apportionment in the Chamber of Deputies and set the number of ministries to eight. During Juan Domingo Per√≥n's government, the Argentine Constitution of 1949 was successfully passed, which constituted a major revision. Its goal was to modernize and adapt the text to the twentieth century's concepts of democracy, for example, adding a list of social rights which included better working conditions for the working class, the right to good education, etc. This also was included in the principles stated in the preamble. It also permitted the indefinite reelection of the president. During the military regime known as the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora that had deposed Per√≥n's government in 1955, in 1957 and before the elections that was to be held in 1958, a Constitutional Convention was elected to reform the constitution. This reform does not include 1949's, implicitly annulling it so the text was based on the 1898 one. The only changes done were to include a summary of Per√≥n's social articles known as article 14 bis (existing currently) and to establish the necessity to have a Labour and Social Security Code. In 1972, a \\"Constitutional Amendment\\" carried out by the military government led by General Alejandro A. Lanusse reformed the 1957 text. This had to last until 1977 but its application could be extended until 1981 if no Constitutional Convention in 1976 decided either to accept it or reject it definitively. This amendment was not fully applied by the democratic government of Per√≥n in his third term nor by his wife Isabel Per√≥n acting as President after his death. Some changes were related to the size of Senate and one-term reelection of president and vice-president. It also reduced presidential, senatorial and deputies' terms all to four years. The last (and current) version of the Argentine Constitution was carried out by Carlos Sa√∫l Menem in 1994. It included many of the modifications from the 1972 \\"amendment\\" as the growth of the Senate size (three per Province), one-term presidential reelection and reduction of its term to four years. It also made Buenos Aires City an autonomous entity with its own authorities. Other changes were done to ensure a softer presidentialist regime, the inclusion of a new chapter into the Bill of Rights related to politics, health and environment, and also the adoption of a much faster legislative procedure for creating laws. In addition to the 1994 constitutional reform, the requirement that the President or Vice President of the Republic belong to the Roman Catholic faith was also abolished. Divisions The Argentine Constitution has four major division types; Parts, Titles, Divisions and Chapters, though these need not be present all the time. For example, the First Part is divided into Chapters but not into Titles nor Sections. The scheme of the Constitution is the following: *Preamble *First Part (43 sections) First Chapter Declarations, rights and guarantees (35 sections) Second Chapter New rights and guarantees (8 sections) *Second Part Authorities of the Nation (86 sections) First Title Federal Government (77 sections) *First Division Of the Legislative Power (43 sections, 42 + 1 separated) First Chapter Of the Chamber of Deputies (9 sections) Second Chapter Of the Senate (9 sections) Third Chapter Common dispositions to both Chambers (12 sections) Fourth Chapter Attributions of the Congress (2 sections, of which one is sub-divided 32 times) Fifth Chapter Of the formation of Laws (8 sections) Sixth Chapter Of the General Audit of the Nation (1 section) Seventh Chapter Of the Ombudsman (1 section) *Second Division Of the Executive Power (21 sections) First Chapter Of its nature and duration (7 sections) Second Chapter Of the way and time of the election of the President and Third Chapter Attributions of the of the Executive Power (1 section sub-divided 20 times) Fourth Chapter Of the ministers (8 sections, of which one is sub- divided 13 times) *Third Division Of the Judicial Power (12 sections) First Chapter Of its nature and duration (8 sections) Second Chapter Attributions of the Judicial Power (4 sections) *Fourth Section Of the Public Ministry (1 section) Second Title Provincial Governments (9 sections) *Transitorial Provisions Preamble \\"Nos los Representantes del Pueblo de la Naci√≥n Argentina ‚Ä¶\\" The Preamble of the Argentine Constitution states or implies, in short terms, a number of starting points for the conception of the nation, such as a representative government. It acknowledges previous agreements to create a constitution (in order to legitimize the gathering of the Assembly). Finally, it lays the foundations for the policy of support of immigration, by asking \\"for the protection of God, source of all reason and justice\\" for all people who desire to inhabit Argentina. Declarations, rights and guarantees  The Constitution establishes a Bill of Rights and Guarantees for all individuals, Argentine or foreign; the inviolability of the right of life, liberty, equality, security and property. The second chapter, added in 1994, deals with public ethics, political rights, environmental protection and consumer rights. Civil rights are recognized to all inhabitants with no distinction of nationality. This is a consequence of the traditional interest of Argentina in the affluence of foreigners and foreign investment. Labor rights are also acknowledged (this is part of the legacy of Peronism, resulting in the 1949 and 1957 reforms). These include limited labor day, just salary, right of organization, social security benefits, etc. The constitution declares that no one can be deprived of property, except in case of judicial sentence based on previously enacted legislation, or through expropriation for reasons of public utility, dully qualified by law and previously indemnified. The person, its judicial defense, its domicile and correspondence are inviolable. What the law does not forbid is permitted. Individuals have complete freedom to do or refuse to do anything in private, except if that interferes with public order or morality, or causes damage to third parties. The 1994 reform introduces several new legal figures: amparo judicial (an injunction), habeas corpus and habeas data. Injunctions are destined to protect citizens from actual or imminent damage; habeas corpus (known for a long time to Argentine jurisprudence, and related to the habeas corpus of Common Law) is to protect the citizen's physical freedom; and habeas data is a person's right to access information about himself or herself, and request its confidentiality, a change or a suppression. The Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social. =Declarations= Declarations state the basis that hold the nation's politics and define it as an independent entity, for example, Article 1 states that the government is representative, republican and federal and Article 35 lists the Country's official names. =Guarantees= They are institutional methods to protect the exercise of fundamental rights. They are so important that it is possible to say that a right can be held as long as it has a guarantee to protect it. Most of Guarantees are in the sections 18 and 43, between these are: habeas corpus, the abolition of death penalty and torture. =Rights= The Argentine Constitution's rights are divided in four groups: Civil, patrimonial, politic and social. * Civil rights are related to the people as individuals. Some examples are: right to live, have honor, have a name, make associations and to express opinions. * Patrimonial rights protect men in relation to their goods. Some examples are: to own, to sell, to hire, and to build legal industries. * Politic rights allow people to take part in the government, by themselves or by electing representatives: this category includes the right to choose and be chosen for the government and to make or join a political party. * Social rights are related to people as part of society: these are (among many others) the rights to work, to have fair wages, to know, to learn, to teach. In Argentina, Freedom is one of the most important rights. Section 19 says that private actions of men that don't harm the public order or another man can not be judged by authorities. Moreover, it holds the \\"principle of legality\\": No inhabitant of the Nation will be forced to do what the law doesn't order nor forbidden to do what the law doesn't forbid. Equality is as important as freedom. Section 16 states that in the country there are no noble titles and \\"all its inhabitants are equal before the law\\" Form of government According to the Constitution, Argentina is a representative federal republic, divided in provinces, municipalities, and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Each province has the right and duty to dictate its own constitution, respecting the same principles as the national constitution. Divisions of government powers Congress building in Buenos Aires, Argentina The Constitution mandates a strict separation of government powers, into three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) and the Public Ministry. =Executive= The Executive Branch is formed by the President, who is both head of state, as well as chief executive and head of government. (Art. 87). The Vice-President replaces the President in case of illness, absence from the capital, death, resignation, or removal. The Vice- President doesn't belong to the executive branch. Curiously, it belongs to the legislative branch since he is also the President of the Senate. (Art. 57) The President promulgates the laws sanctioned by Congress, and has veto power over them. The President directs international relations and is the Commander in Chief of the Army. In some cases, the President can issue emergency decrees. In the 1994 amendments to the 1853 Constitution, the post of the Chief of the Cabinet Ministers was created who would serve as chief operating officer and would run the day-to-day operations of the government and will be at the same time, be politically responsible to the both Houses of the National Congress, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and they can remove him or her via censure. The creation of the post was intended to reduce the presidentialist character of the country's presidential form of government. =Legislative= The Legislative Branch is composed of the Vice-President, a bicameral Congress, the General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman. Congress is divided in two Houses: C√°mara de Diputados (Chamber of Deputies, the Lower House) and C√°mara de Senadores (Senate, the Upper House). The Vice-President belongs in the Legislative Branch since he (or she) is also the President of the Senate Chamber. The General Auditing Office of the Nation is a technical advisory body of Congress with functional autonomy. The Ombudsman is an independent body which works without receiving instructions from any authority. The mission of the Ombudsman is the defense and protection of human rights, civil rights and guarantees, and the control of the Administration. =Judicial= The Judicial Branch is formed by the Supreme Court, and lower courts that Congress establishes in the territory of the Nation. The Supreme Justices and all judges hold their offices as long as they are not deposed for misbehavior and enjoy intangibility of remuneration. =Public Ministry= The Public Ministry is an independent body with functional autonomy and financial autarchy, with the function of promoting justice for the defense of legality, of the general interests of society, in coordination with the other authorities of the Republic.

It was the first airline alliance ever established in Russia. Member airlines and their affiliates enjoyed a high degree of co-operation in scheduling, ticketing, code sharing, flight transfer operations, frequent flyer program benefits, shared airport lounges, reducing costs, and sharing best practices. The airline and member carriers have since gone bankrupt in 2008. With government sponsorship, the alliance was planned to be resurrected as Rossiya as of 2008.http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/10/29/318103/in-brief- europe.htmlhttp://en.rian.ru/business/20081009/117622378.html However, this never took place. History This alliance was established as AirBridge. In October 2004 Russian airlines KrasAir and Domodedovo Airlines set up a joint management company called AirBridge. KrasAir is owned by the city government of Krasnoyarsk (51%) and AirBridge management (49%) (Boris Abramovich - CEO and his brother, Alexander Abramovich - deputy CEO, no relation to Roman Abramovich). While retaining separate legal identities the airlines were planning to integrate their networks and services, as they are largely complementary. In April 2007 AirBridge had purchased Mal√©v airline from Hungarian government. Boris Abramovich is also a CEO of AirUnion alliance. The Abramovich brothers' aggressive expansion campaign led to the creation of AiRUnion alliance in 2005, the first airline alliance in Russia. It included KrasAir, Domodedovo Airlines, Omskavia, Samara Airlines and Sibaviatrans. On May 3, 2007 the five members of the AirUnion alliance were rolled into a similarly named holding company, OAO AirUnion, in which the Russian government holds no less than 45% of the shares.Putin OKs 5-Way Merger of Airlines - International Business Times Although Mal√©v was a Oneworld member, in early 2007 AiRUnion began a codeshare with Austrian Airlines and Lufthansa in its strategic expansion into European routes.Aeroflot‚Äôs competitor becomes strategic partner of Lufthansa :: Russia-InfoCentre AiRUnion was competing with S7 Airlines to become the second largest domestic carrier in Russia in 2007, after Aeroflot.

At an elevation of , it was the first tunnel constructed through the Continental Divide in Colorado, and according to the U.S. Forest Service \\"remains the highest railroad tunnel and the longest narrow gauge tunnel in North America.\\" However, it did not last long in service. Construction began in January 1880 and was scheduled to last for six months but instead dragged on until July 1882, and the line was abandoned in 1910 due to minor damage in the tunnel. Now the tunnel is sealed shut and the remaining trackbed serves as a trail for hikers and bicyclists. History Location of the tunnel portals and establishing a center line of the bore were completed in December 1879. Construction took place from 1880‚Äì1881, by Cummings & Co. Construction company, and the tunnel was \\"holed through\\" on July 26, 1881. This was the highest and most expensive tunnel built up until that time. It is more than two miles (3 km) above sea level, with its highest point at 11,523.7 feet (3,512.4 m). It is 500 feet (150 m) under Altman Pass, later to be renamed Alpine Pass to prevent confusion, with a 1,825-foot (556 m) bore. It took 18 months to complete, with most of the construction done during the winter months. The DSP & P had anticipated boring the Alpine tunnel through solid rock, taking about 6 months to complete. In the event, the line of the tunnel was found to run primarily through loose rock and clay; this very unstable ground required substantial timbering. The additional work necessitated by the unexpected ground conditions was a major contributor to the 18 month construction time. The tunnel was abandoned in 1910 by the Colorado & Southern due to minor damage in the interior. This was not considered to be worth repairing due to a lack of traffic, as the line failed to get much beyond Gunnison on the west side. The Gunnison Division of the Colorado & Southern was abandoned from St. Elmo on the east side of the pass to Quartz on the west side. The line from Quartz to Baldwin was given to the Denver & Rio Grande Western in exchange for some little used lines around Leadville. Present day The east portal of the tunnel has collapsed and the west portal has been covered by landslides. The former railbed is now a hiking trail on the east side, and a rough road over the former railbed on the west side leads to a restored train station. Little remains of the station complex built by the railroad to service its trains and workers at this remote and inhospitable location. Volunteers have restored the railroad's 1883 Alpine Tunnel telegraph office and reconstructed the station platform, of rail track, a turntable and an outhouse. Only ruins remain of the section house and engine house, and other buildings and railroad infrastructure have disappeared. Volunteers work on restoration of the complex at least once a year. The Alpine Tunnel Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1996. It is typically open from July to September.

The 95-meter-high (312 ft) gyro tower is the tallest transportable amusement ride in the world, as well as the highest transportable observation tower. Top of the World is a so-called gyro tower, i.e. it has a circular gallery that is raised while rotating around the tower. The cabin can accommodate up to 132 people while being raised up to 72 meters. The tower was built for Finnendahl, a carny from Bremen, by the Dutch company Nauta-Bussink. In 1995, during its premiere at the Christmas Market in Berlin-Friedrichshain the cold caused an incident. Due to the cold the engine of the tower and the emergency brakes prevented the automatic rise and descent of the gondola, which then had to be lowered manually with a special machine. This caused the rope to slip and, after falling for a few centimeters, the gondola crashed onto the podium. Several passengers were injured. The ride was later sold to the amusement park Freizeit-Land Geiselwind, where it is operating to this day. On 3 September 2019 at about 4:30 pm the ride switched to emergency mode for unknown reasons, causing the observation platform to get stuck 60 meters above ground.

The Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo- Iranian migrations. The GGC, Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryan movements. The Ochre Coloured Pottery culture (OCP) is a 4th millennium BC to 2nd millennium BC Bronze Age culture of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, extending from eastern Punjab to northeastern Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh.Upinder Singh (2008), A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India From the Stone Age to the 12th Century, p.216Kumar, V (2017), Archaeological Gazetteer of Aligarh & Hathras Districts with special reference to OCP & Other Proto-Historic Cultures of Indo-Gangetic Plains. Indian Journal of Archaeology Vol. 2. No. 4, October 2017, p.83-85 It is considered a candidate for association with the early Indo-Aryan or Vedic culture. The pottery had a red slip but gave off an ochre color on the fingers of archaeologists who excavated it, hence the name. It was sometimes decorated with black painted bands and incised patterns. It is often found in association with copper hoards, which are assemblages of copper weapons and other artifacts such as anthropomorphic figures. OCP culture was rural and agricultural, characterized by cultivation of rice, barley, and legumes, and domestication of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and dogs. Most sites were small villages in size, but densely distributed. Houses were typically made of wattle-and-daub. Other artifacts include animal and human figurines, and ornaments made of copper and terracotta.U. Singh (2008), pp.216-218 OCP culture was a contemporary neighbor to Harappan civilization, and between 2500 BC and 2000 BC, the people of Upper Ganga valley were using Indus script. While the eastern OCP did not use Indus script, the whole of OCP had nearly the same material culture and likely spoke the same language throughout its expanse.Kumar, V (2017), Archaeological Gazetteer of Aligarh & Hathras Districts with special reference to OCP & Other Proto-Historic Cultures of Indo-Gangetic Plains. Indian Journal of Archaeology Vol. 2. No. 4, October 2017, p.105U. Singh (2008), pp.216-217 The OCP marked the last stage of the North Indian Bronze Age and was succeeded by the Iron Age black and red ware culture and the Painted Grey Ware culture. Geography Kausambi, c.2000-1750 BCE Early specimens of the characteristic ceramics found near Jodhpura, Rajasthan, date from the 3rd millennium (this Jodhpura is located in the district of Jaipur and should not be confused with the city of Jodhpur). Several sites of culture flourish along the banks of Sahibi River and its tributaries such as Krishnavati river and Soti river, all originating from the Aravalli range and flowing from south to north-east direction towards Yamuna before disappearing in Mahendragarh district of Haryana.Cultural Contours of India: Dr. Satya Prakash Felicitation Volume, Vijai Shankar ≈örivastava, 1981. The culture reached the Gangetic plain in the early 2nd millennium. Recently, the Archaeological Survey of India discovered copper axes and some pieces of pottery in its excavation at the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. The Ochre Coloured Pottery culture has the potential to be called a proper civilisation (e.g., the North Indian Ochre civilisation) like the Harappan civilisation, but is termed only as a culture pending further discoveries. Copper hoards The term copper hoards refers to different assemblages of copper-based artefacts in the northern areas of the Indian Subcontinent that are believed to date from the 2nd millennium BC. Few derive from controlled excavations and several different regional groups are identifiable: southern Haryana/northern Rajasthan, the Ganges-Yamuna plain, Chota Nagpur, and Madhya Pradesh, each with their characteristic artefact types. Initially, the copper hoards were known mostly from the Ganges-Yamuna doab and most characterizations dwell on this material. Characteristic hoard artefacts from southern Haryana/northern Rajasthan include flat axes (celts), harpoons, double axes, and antenna-hilted swords. The doab has a related repertory. Artefacts from the Chota Nagpur area are very different; they seem to resemble ingots and are votive in character. The raw material may have been derived from a variety of sources in Rajasthan (Khetri), Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha (especially Singhbhum), and Madhya Pradesh (Malanjkhand).

Event orderings versus global state A fundamental challenge in defining the Actor model is that it did not provide for global states so that a computational step could not be defined as going from one global state to the next global state as had been done in all previous models of computation. In 1963 in the field of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy introduced situation variables in logic in the Situational Calculus. In McCarthy and Hayes 1969, a situation is defined as \\"the complete state of the universe at an instant of time.\\" In this respect, the situations of McCarthy are not suitable for use in the Actor model since it has no global states. From the definition of an Actor, it can be seen that numerous events take place: local decisions, creating Actors, sending messages, receiving messages, and designating how to respond to the next message received. Partial orderings on such events have been axiomatized in the Actor model and their relationship to physics explored (see Actor model theory). Relationship to physics According to Hewitt (2006), the Actor model is based on physics in contrast with other models of computation that were based on mathematical logic, set theory, algebra, etc. Physics influenced the Actor model in many ways, especially quantum physics and relativistic physics. One issue is what can be observed about Actor systems. The question does not have an obvious answer because it poses both theoretical and observational challenges similar to those that had arisen in constructing the foundations of quantum physics. In concrete terms for Actor systems, typically we cannot observe the details by which the arrival order of messages for an Actor is determined (see Indeterminacy in concurrent computation). Attempting to do so affects the results and can even push the indeterminacy elsewhere. e.g., see metastability in electronics. Instead of observing the insides of arbitration processes of Actor computations, we await the outcomes. Models prior to the Actor model The Actor model builds on previous models of computation. =Lambda calculus= The lambda calculus of Alonzo Church can be viewed as the earliest message passing programming language (see Hewitt, Bishop, and Steiger 1973; Abelson and Sussman 1985). For example, the lambda expression below implements a tree data structure when supplied with parameters for a and .

The substitution model is unsuitable for concurrency because it does not allow the capability of sharing of changing resources. Inspired by the lambda calculus, the interpreter for the programming language Lisp made use of a data structure called an environment so that the values of parameters did not have to be substituted into the body of an invoked lambda expression. This allowed for sharing of the effects of updating shared data structures but did not provide for concurrency. =Simula= Simula 67 pioneered using message passing for computation, motivated by discrete event simulation applications. These applications had become large and unmodular in previous simulation languages. At each time step, a large central program would have to go through and update the state of each simulation object that changed depending on the state of whichever simulation objects it interacted with on that step. Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl developed the idea (first described in an IFIP workshop in 1967) of having methods on each object that would update its own local state based on messages from other objects. In addition they introduced a class structure for objects with inheritance. Their innovations considerably improved the modularity of programs. However, Simula used coroutine control structure instead of true concurrency. =Smalltalk= Alan Kay was influenced by message passing in the pattern-directed invocation of Planner in developing Smalltalk-71. Hewitt was intrigued by Smalltalk-71 but was put off by the complexity of communication that included invocations with many fields including global, sender, receiver, reply-style, status, reply, operator selector, etc. In 1972 Kay visited MIT and discussed some of his ideas for Smalltalk-72 building on the Logo work of Seymour Papert and the \\"little person\\" model of computation used for teaching children to program. However, the message passing of Smalltalk-72 was quite complex. Code in the language was viewed by the interpreter as simply a stream of tokens. As Dan Ingalls later described it: :The first (token) encountered (in a program) was looked up in the dynamic context, to determine the receiver of the subsequent message. The name lookup began with the class dictionary of the current activation. Failing there, it moved to the sender of that activation and so on up the sender chain. When a binding was finally found for the token, its value became the receiver of a new message, and the interpreter activated the code for that object's class. Thus the message-passing model in Smalltalk-72 was closely tied to a particular machine model and programming-language syntax that did not lend itself to concurrency. Also, although the system was bootstrapped on itself, the language constructs were not formally defined as objects that respond to Eval messages (see discussion below). This led some to believe that a new mathematical model of concurrent computation based on message passing should be simpler than Smalltalk-72. Subsequent versions of the Smalltalk language largely followed the path of using the virtual methods of Simula in the message-passing structure of programs. However Smalltalk-72 made primitives such as integers, floating point numbers, etc. into objects. The authors of Simula had considered making such primitives into objects but refrained largely for efficiency reasons. Java at first used the expedient of having both primitive and object versions of integers, floating point numbers, etc. The C# programming language (and later versions of Java, starting with Java 1.5) adopted the less elegant solution of using boxing and unboxing, a variant of which had been used earlier in some Lisp implementations. The Smalltalk system went on to become very influential, innovating in bitmap displays, personal computing, the class browser interface, and many other ways. For details see Kay's The Early History of Smalltalk. Meanwhile, the Actor efforts at MIT remained focused on developing the science and engineering of higher level concurrency. (See the paper by Jean-Pierre Briot for ideas that were developed later on how to incorporate some kinds of Actor concurrency into later versions of Smalltalk.) =Petri nets= Prior to the development of the Actor model, Petri nets were widely used to model nondeterministic computation. However, they were widely acknowledged to have an important limitation: they modeled control flow but not data flow. Consequently, they were not readily composable, thereby limiting their modularity. Hewitt pointed out another difficulty with Petri nets: simultaneous action. I.e., the atomic step of computation in Petri nets is a transition in which tokens simultaneously disappear from the input places of a transition and appear in the output places. The physical basis of using a primitive with this kind of simultaneity seemed questionable to him. Despite these apparent difficulties, Petri nets continue to be a popular approach to modelling concurrency, and are still the subject of active research. =Threads, locks, and buffers (channels)= Prior to the Actor model, concurrency was defined in low-level machine terms of threads, locks and buffers(channels). It certainly is the case that implementations of the Actor model typically make use of these hardware capabilities. However, there is no reason that the model could not be implemented directly in hardware without exposing any hardware threads and locks. Also, there is no necessary relationship between the number of Actors, threads, and locks that might be involved in a computation. Implementations of the Actor model are free to make use of threads and locks in any way that is compatible with the laws for Actors. Abstracting away implementation details An important challenge in defining the Actor model was to abstract away implementation details. For example, consider the following question: \\"Does each Actor have a queue in which its communications are stored until received by the Actor to be processed?\\" Carl Hewitt argued against including such queues as an integral part of the Actor model. One consideration was that such queues could themselves be modeled as Actors that received messages to and the communications. Another consideration was that some Actors would not use such queues in their actual implementation. E.g., an Actor might have a network of arbiters instead. Of course, there is a mathematical abstraction which is the sequence of communications that have been received by an Actor. But this sequence emerged only as the Actor operated. In fact the ordering of this sequence can be indeterminate (see Indeterminacy in concurrent computation). Another example of abstracting away implementation detail was the question of interpretation: \\"Should interpretation be an integral part of the Actor model?\\" The idea of interpretation is that an Actor would be defined by how its program script processed messages. (In this way Actors would be defined in a manner analogous to Lisp which was \\"defined\\" by a meta-circular interpreter procedure named written in Lisp.) Hewitt argued against making interpretation integral to the Actor model. One consideration was that to process the messages, the program script of an Actor would itself have a program script (which in turn would have ...)! Another consideration was that some Actors would not use interpretation in their actual interpretation. E.g., an Actor might be implemented in hardware instead. Of course there is nothing wrong with interpretation per se. Also implementing interpreters using messages is more modular and extensible than the monolithic interpreter approach of Lisp. Operational model Nevertheless, progress developing the model was steady. In 1975, Irene Greif published the first operational model in her dissertation. Scheme Gerald Sussman and Guy Steele then took an interest in Actors and published a paper on their Scheme interpreter in which they concluded \\"we discovered that the 'actors' and the lambda expressions were identical in implementation.\\" According to Hewitt, the lambda calculus is capable of expressing some kinds of parallelism but, in general, not the concurrency expressed in the Actor model. On the other hand, the Actor model is capable of expressing all of the parallelism in the lambda calculus. Laws for Actors Two years after Greif published her operational model, Carl Hewitt and Henry Baker published the Laws for Actors. Proof of continuity of computable functions Using the laws of the Actor model, Hewitt and Baker proved that any Actor that behaves like a function is continuous in the sense defined by Dana Scott (see denotational semantics). Specifications and proofs Aki Yonezawa published his specification and verification techniques for Actors. Russ Atkinson and Carl Hewitt published a paper on specification and proof techniques for serializers providing an efficient solution to encapsulating shared resources for concurrency control. Mathematical characterization using domain theory Finally eight years after the first Actor publication, Will Clinger (building on the work of Irene Greif 1975, Gordon Plotkin 1976, Michael Smyth 1978, Henry Baker 1978, Francez, Hoare, Lehmann, and de Roever 1979, and Milne and Milnor 1979) published the first satisfactory mathematical denotational model incorporating unbounded nondeterminism using domain theory in his dissertation in 1981 (see Clinger's model). Subsequently, Hewitt [2006] augmented the diagrams with arrival times to construct a technically simpler denotational model that is easier to understand. See History of denotational semantics.

She is usually only known as Pina. Early years Pina Pertl was born in Vienna and raised by her grandparents. She began writing songs in her teens and studied classical guitar at the city's conservatorium. She began studies in medicine, but decided on a career in music instead. She found making a living from music in Austria was difficult and relocated to Cork, Ireland, in 1997. Music career Pina's songwriting was inspired by the isolated countryside, and she formed her own band to play on the local music circuit. She played at the Glastonbury Festival in 2003 and began showcasing her talent in London. She was included on a British tour supporting Ani DiFranco and sang a duet with Afro Celt Sound System's Iarla √ì Lion√°ird on the Real World Records album, Volume 3: Further in Time, singing on \\"Go On Through\\". Pina's recording on Further in Time was heard by Peter Gabriel and he released her first album, Quick Look, on his Real World Records label. Billboard called it an \\"extraordinary debut\\", praising her as a \\"gifted\\" instrumentalist and a writer of \\"compelling lyrics.\\" AllMusic compared her to Stevie Nicks, praising her distinctive voice and awarding it 3/5. Les Inrockuptibles compared her to Nick Drake and Emmylou Harris, blending Celtic romanticism with central-European classicism. RootsWorld compared her to Melanie Safka, praising her voice but questioning whether the lyrics meant anything. Classic Rock found her a bit self-obsessed. In 2005 Pina released her second album Guess You Got It. Personal life When she moved to Ireland, Pina was married to Helmut Kollars (b. 1968, Graz), a writer and illustrator of children's books. The couple had a daughter, Luise Magdalena, but divorced before the recording of Pina's first album. Kollars went on to work as a freelance illustrator for publishing and advertising in Ireland, Belgium and the US, and eventually settled in Kassel. Pina had a second daughter in 2006 and married musician Andy Hogg in 2009. In 2007 she completed studies to become a nutritional therapist and moved back to Vienna.

It is the administrative centre of Skvyra Raion (district), and is currently a municipality of raion subordinance. Skvyra has an area of . Its population is approximately . History The Skver synagogue in Skvyra, which was restored in 2004 The ancient town of Skvyra was completely destroyed at the end of the 16th century. In 1736, Skvyra was mentioned as a village (selo) leased by a Jewish lessee. According to the census of 1765, there were 124 houses in Skvyra, 51 of which belonged to Jews. In 1775, 116 Jews lived in Skvyra, in 1784 there were 204, and in 1787, 144. After Skvyra was included in the Pale of Settlement the town's Jewish community increased. Its Jewish population was 2,184 in 1847 and grew to 8,910 in 1897 ‚Äî 49.5% of the general population. At the end of the 19th century Skvyra had seven synagogues, a parochial school, a hospital, a pharmacist and a district doctor. Many Jews were engaged in grain and timber export. By 1910 the town had a Talmud Torah, a Jewish private boys‚Äô school and two private girls‚Äô schools. There were two pogroms in the town in 1917 and a wave of six pogroms in 1919, some of which lasted for several weeks. There were rapes, houses were burnt down, and Jewish property was seized and destroyed or sold to local peasants. 191 people were killed and hundreds injured. After the pogroms an epidemic in the town killed up to 30 people a day. The Jewish population fled to Kyiv, Odessa and Bila Tserkva. Under the Soviet Union the religious and communal life of the Jews of Skvyra was dissolved. The town's Jewish population fell to 4,681 by 1926 (about 33.6% of the population) and 2,243 by 1939, but even so it remained among the biggest Jewish communities of Ukraine at that time. In World War II German forces occupied the town in September 1941. For a time the Sonderkommando headquarters was in Skvyra. On 20 September 1941, 850 Jews were shot in Skvyra. A few days later, over 140 more were executed. According to the head of Skvyra's Jewish community, there were mass shootings of Jews in the area of the market, the secondary school and in Bannaya Street. Skyvra's remaining Jewish population was about 1,000 after the War and fell to about 500 by 1960. It has continued to decline, and in 2009 numbered about 120. Skver Hasidim and New Square The Twersky Skver Hasidic dynasty line emanating from Skvyra eventually settled in the United States where part of the community founded their own incorporated village called New Square (Skvyra being called \\"Skver\\" in Yiddish) in Rockland County, New York. In 2004 the Skvyra synagogue and the tzaddik‚Äôs court, now a hotel for Hasidic visitors, were restored.

Although most PGW sites were small farming villages, \\"several dozen\\" PGW sites emerged as relatively large settlements that can be characterized as towns; the largest of these were fortified by ditches or moats and embankments made of piled earth with wooden palisades, albeit smaller and simpler than the elaborate fortifications which emerged in large cities after 600 BCE.James Heitzman, The City in South Asia (Routledge, 2008), pp.12-13 The PGW Culture probably corresponds to the middle and late Vedic period, i.e., the Kuru-Panchala kingdom, the first large state in the Indian subcontinent after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization.Geoffrey Samuel, (2010) The Origins of Yoga and Tantra: Indic Religions to the Thirteenth Century, Cambridge University Press, pp. 45‚Äì51Michael Witzel (1989), Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes ed.

The Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. The GGC (Swat), Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryan migrations. The PGW culture cultivated rice, wheat, millet and barley, and domesticated cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses. Houses were built of wattle-and-daub, mud, or bricks, ranging in size from small huts to large houses with many rooms. There is a clear settlement hierarchy, with a few central towns that stand out amongst numerous small villages. Some sites, including Jakhera in Uttar Pradesh, demonstrate a ‚Äúfairly evolved, proto-urban or semi-urban stage‚Äù of this culture, with evidence of social organization and trade, including ornaments of gold, copper, ivory, and semi-precious stones, storage bins for surplus grain, stone weights, paved streets, water channels and embankments.Singh, Upinder (2009), A History of Ancient and Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century, Longman, Delhi, pp. 246‚Äì248 The plough was used for cultivation. There are also indications of growing complexity of society as population increased and the size and number of settlements multiplied. Arts and crafts of the PGW people are represented by ornaments (made from terracotta, stone, faience, and glass), human and animal figurines (made from terracotta) as well as \\"incised terracotta discs with decorated edges and geometric motifs\\" which probably had \\"ritual meaning,\\" perhaps representing symbols of deities.Kenoyer, J. M., (2006), \\"Cultures and Societies of the Indus Tradition. In Historical Roots\\" in the Making of ‚Äòthe Aryan‚Äô, R. Thapar (ed.), National Book Trust, New Delhi, pp. 21‚Äì49. There are a few stamp seals with geometric designs but no inscription, contrasting with both the prior Harappan seals and the subsequent Brahmi-inscribed seals of the Northern Black Polished Ware culture. The PGW pottery shows a remarkable degree of standardization. It is dominated by bowls of two shapes, a shallow tray and a deeper bowl, often with a sharp angle between the walls and base. The range of decoration is limited - vertical, oblique or criss-cross lines, rows of dots, spiral chains and concentric circles being common. At Bhagwanpura in the Kurukshetra district of Haryana, excavations have revealed an overlap between the late Harappan and Painted Grey Ware cultures, large houses that may have been elite residences, and fired bricks that may have been used in Vedic altars. Fresh surveys by archaeologist Vinay Kumar Gupta suggest Mathura was the largest PGW site around 375 hectares in area.Gupta, Vinay Kumar, (2014).\\"Early Settlement of Mathura: An Archaeological Perspective\\", An Occasional paper, in History and Society, New Series 41, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi, pp. 1-37. Among the largest sites is also the recently excavated Ahichatra, with at least 40 hectares of area in PGW times along with evidence of early construction of the fortification which goes back to PGW levels.Mani, B. R., (September 17, 2013). \\"What Lies Beneath\\", in Educational Times. Towards the end of the period, many of the PGW settlements grew into the large towns and cities of the Northern Black Polished Ware period. Chronology Two periods of PGW were identified recently at Ahichhatra by archaeologist Bhuvan Vikrama and his group, the earliest from 1500 to 800 BCE, and the late from 800 to 400 BCE.Pokharia, Anil K., Chanchala Srivastava, Bhuvan Vikram, et al. (2015). \\"On the botanical findings from excavations at Ahichchhatra: a multicultural site in Upper Ganga Plain, Uttar Pradesh\\", in Current Science, Vol. 109, No. 7, 10 October 2015, p. 1301. Cameron A. Petrie's team regards PGW lasted from 1500 to 700 BCE.Neogi, Sayantani, Charles A. I. French, Julie A. Durcan, Rabindra N. Singh, and Cameron A. Petrie, (2019). \\"Geoarchaeological insights into the location of Indus settlements on the plains of northwest India\\", in Quaternary Research, Volume 94, March 2020, p. 140. On the other hand, Akinori Uesugi regards PGW as having three periods within North Indian Iron Age which are: Period I (1300-1000 BCE) when it makes its appearance in the Ghaggar valley and the upper Ganga region, Period II (1000-600 BCE) when it spreads into the western part of the Ganga valley, and Period III (600-300 BCE) with interactions to the east.Uesugi, Akinori, (2018). \\"An Overview on the Iron Age in South Asia\\", in (ed.) Akinori Uesugi, Iron Age in South Asia, Kansai University, Fig. 6, pp. 9-12. Vinay Kumar Gupta and B.R. Mani, in a recent analysis conclude that the earliest and late phases of PGW could have begun around 2300 BCE and 700 BCE respectively, making this the longest surviving pottery tradition in Indian archaeology, and they consider the Braj region as the core area of PGW, located in the Western banks of Yamuna river in the Mathura district, expanded to Hathras district in Uttar Pradesh, and to Bharatpur district in Rajasthan.Gupta, Vinay Kumar, and B. R. Mani, (2017). \\"Painted Grey Ware Culture: Changing Perspectives\\", in Heritage, Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies in Archaeology 5 (2017), pp. 373 and 377. Interpretations In the 1950s, archaeologist B.B. Lal associated Hastinapura, Mathura, Ahichatra, Kampilya, Barnava, Kurukshetra and other sites of PGW culture with the Mahabharata period. Furthermore, he pointed out that the Mahabharata mentions a flood and a layer of flooding debris was found in Hastinapura. However, B.B. Lal considered his theories to be provisional and based upon a limited body of evidence, and he later reconsidered his statements on the nature of this culture (Kenneth Kennedy 1995). B.B. Lal confirmed that Mahabharata is associated with PGW sites in a recent 2012 presentation at the International Seminar on Mahabharata held by Draupadi Trust and gives a date to c. 900 BCE for the War recounted in the Mahabharata. The pottery style of this culture is different from the pottery of the Iranian Plateau and Afghanistan (Bryant 2001). In some sites, PGW pottery and Late Harappan pottery are contemporaneous.Shaffer, Jim. 1993, Reurbanization: The eastern Punjab and beyond. In Urban Form and Meaning in South Asia: The Shaping of Cities from Prehistoric to Precolonial Times, ed. H. Spodek and D.M. Srinivasan. The archaeologist Jim Shaffer (1984:84-85) has noted that \\"at present, the archaeological record indicates no cultural discontinuities separating Painted Grey Ware from the indigenous protohistoric culture.\\" However, the continuity of pottery styles may be explained by the fact that pottery was generally made by indigenous craftsmen even after the Indo-Aryan migration. According to Chakrabarti (1968) and other scholars, the origins of the subsistence patterns (e.g. rice use) and most other characteristics of the Painted Grey Ware culture are in eastern India or even Southeast Asia. Recent Research In 2013, the University of Cambridge and Banaras Hindu University excavated at Alamgirpur near Delhi, where they found a period overlap between the later part of the Harappan phase (with a \\"noticeable slow decline in quality\\") and the earliest PGW levels; Sample OxA-21882 showed a calibrated radiocarbon dating from 2136 BCE to 1948 BCE, but seven other samples from the overlap phase that were submitted for dating failed to give a result.Singh, R.N., Cameron Petrie et al., (2013). \\"Recent Excavations at Alamgirpur, Meerut District: A Preliminary Report\\", in Man and Environment 38(1), pp. 32-54. A team of the Archaeological Survey of India led by B.R. Mani and Vinay Kumar Gupta collected charcoal samples from Gosna, a site 6 km east of Mathura across the Yamuna river, where two of the radiocarbon dates from the PGW deposit came out to be 2160 BCE and 2170 BCE, but they mention that \\"there is a possibility that the cultural horizon which is now regarded as belonging to the P.G.W. period might turn out to be as belonging to a period with only plain grey ware.\\" However, later on, other two datings confirming early PGW horizon in Kampil excavations were published as 2310 +/- 120 BCE and 1360 +/- 90 BCE by archaeologist D.P. Tewari.Tewari, D.P., (2014). \\"The Ceramic Traditions from Kampil Excavations\\", in Puratattva No.44, pp.194-207. Excavation at Anuradhapura has unearthed PGW pottery from the 'Basal early historic' period of Anuradhapura (600 BC-500 BC) showing connections with North India.

Punching is applicable to a wide variety of materials that come in sheet form, including sheet metal, paper, vulcanized fibre and some forms of plastic sheet. The punch often passes through the work into a die. A scrap slug from the hole is deposited into the die in the process. Depending on the material being punched this slug may be recycled and reused or discarded. Punching is often the cheapest method for creating holes in sheet materials in medium to high production volumes. When a specially shaped punch is used to create multiple usable parts from a sheet of material the process is known as blanking. In metal forging applications the work is often punched while hot, and this is called hot punching. Slugging is the operation of punching in which the punch is stopped as soon as the metal fracture is complete and metal is not removed but held in hole.  Process  Punch tooling (punch and die) is often made of hardened steel or tungsten carbide. A die is located on the opposite side of the workpiece and supports the material around the perimeter of the hole and helps to localize the shearing forces for a cleaner edge. There is a small amount of clearance between the punch and the die to prevent the punch from sticking in the die and so less force is needed to make the hole. The amount of clearance needed depends on the thickness, with thicker materials requiring more clearance, but the clearance is always greater than the thickness of the workpiece. The clearance is also dependent on the hardness of the workpiece. The punch press forces the punch through a workpiece, producing a hole that has a diameter equivalent to the punch, or slightly smaller after the punch is removed. All ductile materials stretch to some extent during punching which often causes the punch to stick in the workpiece. In this case, the punch must be physically pulled back out of the hole while the work is supported from the punch side, and this process is known as stripping. The hole walls will show burnished area, rollover, and die break and must often be further processed. The slug from the hole falls through the die into some sort of container to either dispose of the slug or recycle it.  Punching characteristics  HACO Q5HACO Q5 punching machine with a high speed servo hydraulic punching head The characteristics of punching are: *It is the most cost effective process of making holes in strip or sheet metal for average to high fabrication. *It is able to create multiple shaped holes. *Punches and dies are usually fabricated from conventional tool steel or carbides *It creates a burnished region roll-over, and die break on sidewall of the resulting hole.Todd, Robert H., Dell K. Allen, and Leo Alting. Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide. New York: Industrial Press Inc. 1994. Pg 107. *It is a quick process.  Geometry  The workpiece is often in the form of a sheet or roll. Materials for the workpiece can vary, commonly being metals and plastics. The punch and die themselves can have a variety of shapes to create an array of different shaped holes in the workpiece. Multiple punches may be used together to create a part in one step. Extruded holes with the punch and die used to create them. No pilot hole was used on the left. Usually, the punch and die are close to the same dimensions, creating a sheared edge when they meet. A punch that is significantly smaller than the die can be used to produce an extruded hole where the punch displaces the punched material to the sides, forming a tube perpendicular to the punched sheet.Peter Ulintz, Hole Extrusions--Part 1 Metalforming Magazine , Oct. 2011.O. D. Lascoe, 6B: Design Considerations for Stamping, Handbook of Fabrication Processes, ASM International, 1988; page 435.  Equipment  Most punch presses are mechanically operated, but simple punches are often hand- powered. Major components of this mechanical press are the frame, motor, ram, die posts, bolster, and bed. The punch is mounted into the ram, and the die is mounted to the bolster plate. The scrap material drops through as the workpiece is advanced for the next hole. Most common in industry are large computer-controlled punch press, called a CNC. These most commonly are of the 'turret' or 'rail' variety. A turret punch press houses punches and their corresponding dies in a revolving indexed turret, while a rail type punch stores tooling on a back rail out of the way of the workpiece. These machines use hydraulic as well as pneumatic power to press the shape with enough force to shear the metal.  Forces  The punch force required to punch a piece of sheet metal can be estimated from the following equation:Kalpakjian, Serope; Schmid, Steven R. (2006). Manufacturing Engineering and Technology (5th edition ed.) p. 428. :F = 0.7tL(UTS) Where t is the sheet metal thickness, L is the total length sheared (perimeter of the shape), and UTS is the ultimate tensile strength of the material. Die and punch shapes affect the force during the punching process. The punch force increases during the process as the entire thickness of the material is sheared at once. A beveled punch helps in the shearing of thicker materials by reducing the force at the beginning of the stroke. However, beveling a punch will disort the shape because of lateral forces that develop. Compound dies allow multiple shaping to occur. Using compound dies will generally slow down the process and are typically more expensive than other dies. Progressive dies may be used in high production operations. Different punching operations and dies may be used at different stages of the operation on the same machine.  Related processes  Other processes such as stamping, blanking, perforating, parting, drawing, notching, lancing and bending operations are all related to punching.  Plastics  Punching in plastics fabrication usually refers to the removal of scrap plastic from the desired article. For example, in extrusion blow molding it is common to use punching dies to remove tails, molding flash (scrap plastic) and handle slugs from bottles or other molded containers. In shuttle machinery, the containers are usually trimmed in the machines, and finished containers leave the blow molding machine. Other blow molding equipment, such as rotary wheel machinery, requires the use of downstream trimming. Types of downstream trimming equipment include detabbers for tail removal, rotary or reciprocating punch trimmers, and spin trimmers.

He is a senior officer in the British Secret Intelligence Service who serves as a Soviet mole. The novel follows aging spymaster George Smiley's endeavours to uncover the mole. The character is partly modelled after the real-life double agent Kim Philby, part of the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring in Britain, who defected to the USSR in 1963. Biography Haydon was born around 1917; no specific year is given but he is known to have been an undergraduate at Oxford University in 1937. He comes from an eminent family with connections throughout British high society; his father is a high court judge, and two of his several sisters married into the aristocracy.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, John le Carr√©, Sceptre, 2011, p. 177 He is a cousin of Ann Smiley.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, John le Carr√©, Sceptre, 2011, p. 82 A polymath of sorts with a brilliant and charming personality, he excels as a student, takes up remote languages with ease, and proves a gifted painter while at Oxford. He is identified for recruitment in the Circus (John le Carr√©'s lightly fictionalised version of MI6/SIS) by his tutor and acts in turn as a talent-spotter among his classmates, most notably Jim Prideaux, who also becomes his lover. In World War II, Haydon builds a superb record in Nazi-occupied Europe and the Middle East, such that he elicits comparisons with Lawrence of Arabia. Unbeknown to the British, Haydon is also recruited as a Soviet agent around that time by Karla, Moscow Centre's crafty and legendary spymaster. After the war, Haydon holds positions of increasing importance in the Circus, becomes its premier expert on the Soviet Union, and eventually rises to the senior staff of Control, the unnamed Chief of the Circus. In the early years of the Cold War, he limits his espionage activities to 'selected gifts of intelligence' that advance the Soviet cause over the American one without harming British interests. The Suez crisis of 1956 convinces him that Britain has lost all influence as a world power and leads him to become a 'full-time Soviet mole with no holds barred.' In 1961, he formally receives Soviet citizenship, then achieves the rank of Soviet intelligence colonel and is awarded further Soviet decorations over the next ten years. Control has come to suspect that there is a mole deep in the organization. By 1972, alone in this belief, he has ruled out all but his five senior lieutenants: Percy Alleline, Roy Bland, George Smiley, Toby Esterhase, and Haydon. To save his agent, Karla engineers the professional ruin of Control and Smiley whom he reckons to be the most likely to unmask Haydon. Karla is aware of Smiley's one personal weakness ‚Äî his unreciprocated love for his wife Ann, who is a habitual adulteress ‚Äî and orders Haydon to have an affair with her to cloud Smiley's judgment further. As Control is about to discover the truth, Karla lures him into ordering a doomed operation in Czechoslovakia to learn the identity of the mole from a (fake) Czech defector. Control picks Jim Prideaux for the operation and Haydon chooses to sacrifice his close friend to save himself. Prideaux is captured and reveals under duress the full extent of Control's knowledge of the mole to Karla before being repatriated to Britain and discharged from the Circus. Control is dismissed and dies soon afterwards, Smiley is forced into retirement, and Alleline becomes Chief. Haydon assumes control of London Station, in control of all foreign operations, effectively giving him unfettered access to intelligence worldwide. In 1973, an indiscretion by a Soviet operative in Hong Kong confirms the existence of the mole to Oliver Lacon, the Civil Service overseer of the Circus in Whitehall. Smiley is recalled from retirement to investigate and ultimately unmasks Haydon after a tortuous, soul-searching quest. Under interrogation, Haydon reveals much of his secret past to Smiley and plans are set in motion to exchange Haydon for Western agents held in the Eastern Bloc, but before this happens he is killed while still in Circus custody. It is strongly implied, though never stated, that the killer was Prideaux. Background Bill Haydon, with his easy charm and strong social connections, bears a close resemblance to real-life double agent Kim Philby whose defection to the USSR in 1963, and the consequent compromising of British agents, was a factor in the 1964 termination of Le Carr√©'s own career in the SIS. Philby, along with Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt, and John Cairncross, was part of a group of Soviet moles in Britain which later came to be known as the Cambridge Five. While in an earlier draft of the novel, there were reportedly greater similarities to Anthony Blunt, the final character is closely aligned with Philby. According to Le Carr√©, Philby's career illustrates the \\"capacity of the British ruling class for reluctant betrayal and polite self-preservation,\\" and that the British secret services are \\"microcosms of the British condition, of our social attitudes and vanities. In describing Philby, Le Carre wrote that \\"to the very end, he expected and received the indulgence owing to his moderation, good breeding and boyish, flirtatious charm.\\" American film theorist David Bordwell notes that the description might be applied to Haydon as well. The novel is set against a period of waning British influence on the world stage, with USA and USSR emerging as the dominant superpowers, albeit with conflicting ideologies. This forms the basis for Haydon's betrayal. He claims that, although he was recruited by Soviet intelligence at university in the 1930s, he only became a serious agent for them following the Suez crisis when it became clear to him that Britain was no longer a world power and, in his view, was subservient to America. This perceived inferiority leads to Haydon developing a deep hatred for America, resolving him to damage them as much as possible by spying for the Soviets. Portrayals Haydon was played by Ian Richardson in the 1979 BBC television serial based on the novel. In the 1988 BBC Radio 4 series, he was played by Edward de Souza. In the 2011 film adaptation, he was played by Colin Firth. In the 2011 Radio 4 series, The Complete Smiley, he was portrayed by Michael Feast.

Headsets for instantaneous translation at London ESFBabels originated in the process of preparation for the 2002 ESF, a left-wing conference of the anti-globalization movement held in Florence. A small network of 'communication activists' associated with ATTAC France proposed that the conference use only volunteers to interpret the various languages of the speakers for the audience.

The group had no official space to work from and little funds so had to squat a medieval tower. After the first ESF the organisers of the translation formed Babels groups in France and Italy and groups also sprang up in Germany, the UK, and Spain.

It usually occurs when a rule is given, but there may be specific exceptions to the rule, or subclasses that are subject to a different rule. Defeasibility is found in literatures that are concerned with argument and the process of argument, or heuristic reasoning. Defeasible reasoning is a particular kind of non-demonstrative reasoning, where the reasoning does not produce a full, complete, or final demonstration of a claim, i.e., where fallibility and corrigibility of a conclusion are acknowledged. In other words, defeasible reasoning produces a contingent statement or claim. Defeasible reasoning is also a kind of ampliative reasoning because its conclusions reach beyond the pure meanings of the premises. Defeasible reasoning finds its fullest expression in jurisprudence, ethics and moral philosophy, epistemology, pragmatics and conversational conventions in linguistics, constructivist decision theories, and in knowledge representation and planning in artificial intelligence. It is also closely identified with prima facie (presumptive) reasoning (i.e., reasoning on the \\"face\\" of evidence), and ceteris paribus (default) reasoning (i.e., reasoning, all things \\"being equal\\"). According to at least some schools of philosophy, all reasoning is at most defeasible, and there is no such thing as absolutely certain deductive reasoning, since it is impossible to be absolutely certain of all the facts (and know with certainty that nothing is unknown). Thus all deductive reasoning is in reality contingent and defeasible.  Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning  Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning are probabilistic reasoning, inductive reasoning, statistical reasoning, abductive reasoning, and paraconsistent reasoning. The differences between these kinds of reasoning correspond to differences about the conditional that each kind of reasoning uses, and on what premise (or on what authority) the conditional is adopted: * Deductive (from meaning postulate or axiom): if p then q (equivalent to q or not-p in classical logic, not necessarily in other logics) * Defeasible (from authority): if p then (defeasibly) q * Probabilistic (from combinatorics and indifference): if p then (probably) q * Statistical (from data and presumption): the frequency of qs among ps is high (or inference from a model fit to data); hence, (in the right context) if p then (probably) q * Inductive (theory formation; from data, coherence, simplicity, and confirmation): (inducibly) \\"if p then q\\"; hence, if p then (deducibly-but-revisably) q * Abductive (from data and theory): p and q are correlated, and q is sufficient for p; hence, if p then (abducibly) q as cause  History  Though Aristotle differentiated the forms of reasoning that are valid for logic and philosophy from the more general ones that are used in everyday life (see dialectics and rhetoric), 20th century philosophers mainly concentrated on deductive reasoning. At the end of the 19th century, logic texts would typically survey both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning, often giving more space to the latter. However, after the blossoming of mathematical logic at the hands of Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead and Willard van Orman Quine, latter-20th century logic texts paid little attention to the non-deductive modes of inference. There are several notable exceptions. John Maynard Keynes wrote his dissertation on non- demonstrative reasoning, and influenced the thinking of Ludwig Wittgenstein on this subject. Wittgenstein, in turn, had many admirers, including the positivist legal scholar H.L.A. Hart and the speech act linguist John L. Austin, Stephen Toulmin and Chaim Perelman in rhetoric, the moral theorists W.D. Ross and C.L. Stevenson, and the vagueness epistemologist/ontologist Friedrich Waismann. The etymology of defeasible usually refers to Middle English law of contracts, where a condition of defeasance is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy, deprecate and derogate are often used in the same contexts as defease, the verbs annul and invalidate (and nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal, void, cancel, countermand, preempt, etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter d. Many dictionaries do contain the verb, to defease with past participle, defeased. Philosophers in moral theory and rhetoric had taken defeasibility largely for granted when American epistemologists rediscovered Wittgenstein's thinking on the subject: John Ladd, Roderick Chisholm, Roderick Firth, Ernest Sosa, Robert Nozick, and John L. Pollock all began writing with new conviction about how appearance as red was only a defeasible reason for believing something to be red. More importantly Wittgenstein's orientation toward language-games (and away from semantics) emboldened these epistemologists to manage rather than to expurgate prima facie logical inconsistency. At the same time (in the mid-1960s), two more students of Hart and Austin at Oxford, Brian Barry and David Gauthier, were applying defeasible reasoning to political argument and practical reasoning (of action), respectively. Joel Feinberg and Joseph Raz were beginning to produce equally mature works in ethics and jurisprudence informed by defeasibility. By far the most significant works on defeasibility by the mid-1970s were in epistemology, where John Pollock's 1974 Knowledge and Justification popularized his terminology of undercutting and rebutting (which mirrored the analysis of Toulmin). Pollock's work was significant precisely because it brought defeasibility so close to philosophical logicians. The failure of logicians to dismiss defeasibility in epistemology (as Cambridge's logicians had done to Hart decades earlier) landed defeasible reasoning in the philosophical mainstream. Defeasibility had always been closely related to argument, rhetoric, and law, except in epistemology, where the chains of reasons, and the origin of reasons, were not often discussed. Nicholas Rescher's Dialectics is an example of how difficult it was for philosophers to contemplate more complex systems of defeasible reasoning. This was in part because proponents of informal logic became the keepers of argument and rhetoric while insisting that formalism was anathema to argument. About this time, researchers in artificial intelligence became interested in non-monotonic reasoning and its semantics. With philosophers such as Pollock and Donald Nute (e.g., defeasible logic), dozens of computer scientists and logicians produced complex systems of defeasible reasoning between 1980 and 2000. No single system of defeasible reasoning would emerge in the same way that Quine's system of logic became a de facto standard. Nevertheless, the 100-year headstart on non-demonstrative logical calculi, due to George Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Gottlob Frege was being closed: both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning now have formal calculi. There are related (and slightly competing) systems of reasoning that are newer than systems of defeasible reasoning, e.g., belief revision and dynamic logic. The dialogue logics of Charles Hamblin and Jim Mackenzie, and their colleagues, can also be tied closely to defeasible reasoning. Belief revision is a non-constructive specification of the desiderata with which, or constraints according to which, epistemic change takes place. Dynamic logic is related mainly because, like paraconsistent logic, the reordering of premises can change the set of justified conclusions. Dialogue logics introduce an adversary, but are like belief revision theories in their adherence to deductively consistent states of belief. Political and judicial use Many political philosophers have been fond of the word indefeasible when referring to rights, e.g., that were inalienable, divine, or indubitable. For example, in the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights, \\"community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish government...\\" (also attributed to James Madison); and John Adams, \\"The people have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge ‚Äì I mean of the character and conduct of their rulers.\\" Also, Lord Aberdeen: \\"indefeasible right inherent in the British Crown\\" and Gouverneur Morris: \\"the Basis of our own Constitution is the indefeasible Right of the People.\\" Scholarship about Abraham Lincoln often cites these passages in the justification of secession. Philosophers who use the word defeasible have historically had different world views from those who use the word indefeasible (and this distinction has often been mirrored by Oxford and Cambridge zeitgeist); hence it is rare to find authors who use both words. In judicial opinions, the use of defeasible is commonplace. There is however disagreement among legal logicians whether defeasible reasoning is central, e.g., in the consideration of open texture, precedent, exceptions, and rationales, or whether it applies only to explicit defeasance clauses. H.L.A. Hart in The Concept of Law gives two famous examples of defeasibility: \\"No vehicles in the park\\" (except during parades); and \\"Offer, acceptance, and memorandum produce a contract\\" (except when the contract is illegal, the parties are minors, inebriated, or incapacitated, etc.).  Specificity  One of the main disputes among those who produce systems of defeasible reasoning is the status of a rule of specificity. In its simplest form, it is the same rule as subclass inheritance preempting class inheritance: (R1) if r then (defeasibly) q e.g., if bird, then can fly (R2) if p then (defeasibly) not-q e.g., if penguin, then cannot fly (O1) if p then (deductively) r e.g., if penguin, then bird (M1) arguably, p e.g., arguably, penguin (M2) R2 is a more specific reason than R1 e.g., R2 is better than R1 (M3) therefore, arguably, not-q e.g., therefore, arguably, not-flies Approximately half of the systems of defeasible reasoning discussed today adopt a rule of specificity, while half expect that such preference rules be written explicitly by whoever provides the defeasible reasons. For example, Rescher's dialectical system uses specificity, as do early systems of multiple inheritance (e.g., David Touretzky) and the early argument systems of Donald Nute and of Guillermo Simari and Ronald Loui. Defeasible reasoning accounts of precedent (stare decisis and case-based reasoning) also make use of specificity (e.g., Joseph Raz and the work of Kevin D. Ashley and Edwina Rissland). Meanwhile, the argument systems of Henry Prakken and Giovanni Sartor, of Bart Verheij and Jaap Hage, and the system of Phan Minh Dung do not adopt such a rule.  Nature of defeasibility  There is a distinct difference between those who theorize about defeasible reasoning as if it were a system of confirmational revision (with affinities to belief revision), and those who theorize about defeasibility as if it were the result of further (non-empirical) investigation. There are at least three kinds of further non-empirical investigation: progress in a lexical/syntactic process, progress in a computational process, and progress in an adversary or legal proceeding. ; Defeasibility as corrigibility : Here, a person learns something new that annuls a prior inference. In this case, defeasible reasoning provides a constructive mechanism for belief revision, like a truth maintenance system as envisioned by Jon Doyle. ; Defeasibility as shorthand for preconditions : Here, the author of a set of rules or legislative code is writing rules with exceptions. Sometimes a set of defeasible rules can be rewritten, with more cogency, with explicit (local) pre-conditions instead of (non-local) competing rules. Many non-monotonic systems with fixed-point or preferential semantics fit this view. However, sometimes the rules govern a process of argument (the last view on this list), so that they cannot be re-compiled into a set of deductive rules lest they lose their force in situations with incomplete knowledge or incomplete derivation of preconditions. ; Defeasibility as an anytime algorithm : Here, it is assumed that calculating arguments takes time, and at any given time, based on a subset of the potentially constructible arguments, a conclusion is defeasibly justified. Isaac Levi has protested against this kind of defeasibility, but it is well-suited to the heuristic projects of, for example, Herbert A. Simon. On this view, the best move so far in a chess-playing program's analysis at a particular depth is a defeasibly justified conclusion. This interpretation works with either the prior or the next semantical view. ; Defeasibility as a means of controlling an investigative or social process : Here, justification is the result of the right kind of procedure (e.g., a fair and efficient hearing), and defeasible reasoning provides impetus for pro and con responses to each other. Defeasibility has to do with the alternation of verdict as locutions are made and cases presented, not the changing of a mind with respect to new (empirical) discovery. Under this view, defeasible reasoning and defeasible argumentation refer to the same phenomenon.

Today, Dog Town is a defunct gold rush era town in Mono County, California. It is located at , on Dog Creek, near the junction of Clearwater and Virginia Creeks, about south-southeast of Bridgeport, at an elevation of 7057 feet (2151 m). History The town was established in approximately 1857 by Carl Norst as a placer mining camp. By 1859, a group of Mormons had arrived as miners at the site and a mining camp arose. Dog Town became the site of the first gold rush to the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada. Prospectors rushed here after hearing rumors of gold being washed out near Mono Lake. A small camp and trading center sprung up immediately. Dogtown did attract attention to the area as a whole, including the subsequent discoveries of much richer gold deposits in nearby areas such as Bodie, Aurora and Masonic. Town name The name \\"Dogtown\\" was often applied by miners to camps where living conditions were miserable. It was derived from a popular miner‚Äôs term for camps made of huts. A cemetery and ruins of the makeshift dwellings that once formed part of the ‚Äúdiggings‚Äù here are all that remain of this rugged, yet historically significant town; making the name \\"Dogtown Diggings.\\" It was also said that the town got its name from the number of dogs there actually were in the town. According to passed down history, a woman had come to the town with her three dogs which began breeding. Then as she found that the male miners felt alone without their families, she sold them the puppies for pinches of gold. This then led to even more puppies being born and populating the town, hence the name Dog Town. Mining success Dog Town produced the largest gold nugget ever found on the Sierra‚Äôs eastern slope. However, its overall gold production was not extensive. Within a couple years of its establishment, the town was abandoned as miners left in search of more profitable strikes. Nearby, the more appealing and profitable town of Monoville was booming, eventually expanding to a population of 700 pioneers. In its prime from 1849 to the turn of the century, Dog Town was also one of the biggest hydraulic mining camps in California. Hundreds of men operating giant hoses equipped with rotating nozzles washed down vast mountain slopes in search of gold. Today , the surviving remnants of Dogtown are the walls of several stone huts, a few roof timbers, and a single gravesite. The ruins have been mildly vandalized. All that remains of old Dogtown are scattered building foundations and a few wooden structures on the verge of collapse. Surrounding ranches and three homes of relatively recent vintage along French Gulch Creek occupy what once was a riotous mining camp. People today still continue to search for gold in Dog Town. While the older miners gave up on striking riches there, prospectors insist that not all the gold was taken and some still remains in those hills and old diggings. The site is registered as California Historical Landmark. A landmark plaque by the side of nearby U.S. Highway 395 marks the location. Dog Town‚Äôs ruins and its commemorative plaque is located on Highway 395 at post mile 69.5 (7 miles south of Bridgeport.)

The line was originally intended to run to Peterborough, but the competing Cobourg and Peterborough Railway was completed in 1854 and the owner's plans changed. Redirecting the line northward, it opened as the Port Hope, Lindsay & Beaverton Railway, a much longer line than originally planned. A further expansion launched in 1869 pushed the line westward towards Georgian Bay, and prompted renaming as the Midland Railway. By the 1880s the area east of Toronto was over-served by a number of short and generally unprofitable lines. Merger plans between the various lines began in 1881, which resulted in the Midland adding a third rail to the Toronto and Nipissing Railway's (T&N;) narrow-gauge line to allow Midland trains to follow the T&N; lines into Scarborough. The merger was officially completed in 1881. On 10 March 1882 the company arranged an enormous merger of many of the smaller railways in the area, including the Whitby, Port Perry and Lindsay Railway, Victoria Railway, Toronto and Ottawa Railway and Grand Junction Railway to become a greatly expanded Midland Railway with of track. Only two years later the Grand Trunk Railway leased most of the lines in the area as part of a major expansion plan, and purchased them outright in 1893. The Midland was one of the earliest examples of a rail trail conversion in Ontario, started as a Canadian Centennial project. Today, the Midland Railway mainline forms a major portion of the Ganaraska Hiking Trail, the majority of which was opened in 1969. History =Designs on Peterborough= Fierce competition between the Lake Ontario port towns of Port Hope and neighbouring Cobourg drove development of transport through the area during the middle of the 19th century. The competition had started with the 1834 announcements of plans to run a railway from Cobourg to Peterborough, at that time a rapidly developing industrial town. The initial plans for the Cobourg and Peterborough Railway went nowhere due to a lack of funds, especially after the Panic of 1837. The formation of the federal government and its ministry for development led to both Port Hope and Cobourg competing for funds to develop a line to Peterborough. The Cobourg line was designed to run across Rice Lake, and was therefore more risky than the Port Hope line that ran around the western end of the Lake. The Port Hope proposal was accepted, and The Peterborough and Port Hope Railway Company (P&PH;) was officially chartered on 16 December 1846. Cobourg responded by rapidly building a plank road near their original railway route, which was completed by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the Port Hope plans received no further funding, and eventually went moribund. Cobourg's plank road proved impassible in spring and fall, and by 1850 had fallen into disrepair. Plans for a railway from Cobourg once again surfaced, this time more successfully. Construction on the line started in 1853, and the new Cobourg and Peterborough Railway (C&P;) reached Peterborough at the end of 1854. =Lindsay and Beaverton= With the route to Peterborough now being served by Cobourg, and their original plans having seen no development for six years, business interests in Port Hope looked further north for potential markets. They eventually selected the town of Lindsay due to its connection to the recently announced Trent-Severn Waterway, with a further expansion to the shores of Lake Simcoe. The new railway received its charter on 18 December 1854 as The Port Hope, Lindsay and Beaverton Railway Company (PHL&B;). Construction reached Lindsay in late 1857. By that time the Cobourg and Peterborough had proven to be unreliable due to its constantly failing bridge, and the Lindsay and Beaverton opened their Millbrook Branch to Peterborough in 1858. This was a serious threat to the C&P;, who ousted their operator, D'Arcy Boulton Jr. Boulton soon took out the operations lease on the Millbrook Branch along with two partners, Henry Covert and John Fowler. The next year the three presented a plan to lease operations of the C&P; as well. As soon as this was completed, the new operators laid off the men working to finally fix the C&P; bridge over Rice Lake, and later sabotaged it so that it eventually fell into the lake around 1861. The PHL&B; now had exclusive access to Peterborough, which they retained for some time. Further expansions were slow in coming. The line did not reach its planned terminus in Beaverton until 1 January 1871, and that same year the Millbrook Branch pushed north out of Peterborough to Lakefield, giving it access to the middle-area of the Trent waterway on Katchewanooka Lake. The competing Cobourg line started the similar Peterborough and Chemong Lake Railway in 1857, but this was not completed until 1891. The Railway started the 1870s in good financial condition. In 1870 its receipts were $242,157 against expenses of $113,227, an Operating Ratio of 47%. By this time the company had plans for a much more ambitious expansion. =Midland Railway= On 24 December 1869 the company was re-chartered as The Midland Railway of Canada (MR) with plans to drive around Lake Simcoe and the head towards Midland to provide access to Georgian Bay. In 1872 Frank Shanly was awarded the contract for the new fifty- three mile section. There were unforeseen difficulties with the ground and a rapid increase in labour costs, which ruined Shanly. The Midland was financially strapped, could not afford to pay Shanly for the extras, and seized the contract back in February 1873. At the same time the recession hit freight receipts which fell by 30% between 1872 and 1874. The first Midland Railway manager D‚ÄôArcy E. Boulton of Cobourg, Ontario was replaced by Adolf Hugel of Pittsburgh. Hugel invested money in steel rails and struggled to cut costs. In recognition of his efforts to improve the line, the British bondholders agreed in 1874 to lower the rate on their investments, and not to cash the interest coupons. The line eventually reached Orillia in 1873, Waubaushene in 1875 and Midland in 1879. Net earnings and the ability to pay interest on the fixed debt declined sharply after 1875, the Midland was insolvent and the ownership of the line essentially passed to the bondholders. The Chairman of their Committee was Sir Henry Tyler of the Grand Trunk Railway and most of the other members were GTR nominees. George Albertus Cox, a prosperous insurance agent for Canada Life and several times Mayor of Peterborough, took over as President of the MR in August 1878. Merger The Midland (144 route miles) was surrounded by railways which also were not making money: * The Grand Junction Railway of Canada (90 route miles) * The Belleville and North Hastings Railway (15 route miles) * The Victoria Railway (56 route miles) * The Whitby, Port Perry and Lindsay Railway (46¬Ω route miles) * The Toronto and Nipissing Railway (114 route miles of 3' 6\\" gauge) Cox first floated a proposal to purchase the Toronto and Nipissing Railway in July 1881 in order to gain the supreme prize of direct Midland Railway access to Toronto. Negotiations continued throughout the Fall and Winter when the shareholders and bondholders were presented with a proposal for ‚ÄòApproving an agreement between the Toronto and Nipissing Railway Company; the Whitby, Port Perry and Lindsay Company, the Victoria Railway Company, the Toronto and Ottawa Railway Company; the Grand Junction Railway Company and the Midland Railway Company for the purpose of consolidating said companies into one company, under the name of the Midland Railway of Canada.‚Äô The T&NR; and the Midland Railway had always maintained good relations and since it was certain that the T&NR; could not long survive in its present form, work commenced during the negotiations to lay a third rail from Midland Junction to Scarborough Junction. The first through passenger train from Peterborough to Toronto ran on December 15, 1881. An Act enabling the merger came into force on Saturday April 1, 1882 and on that day the first official trains of the new Midland Railway of Canada travelled the system. On January 1, 1884 the GTR finally consolidated its hold on the Midland group of companies by leasing them. Amalgamation of the companies was authorized in 1893.S.C. 1893, c. 47 It was eventually absorbed into the Canadian National Railway system.

Biography Bryan Ugartechea, Tony Freithoffer and Ricky Myers formed Disgorge in 1992. The same year they released their first demo, Cognitive Lust of Mutilation, before moving shortly afterwards to San Diego, California to establish themselves in the underground scene. During the move, the band parted ways with bassist/vocalist Ugartechea. New vocalist Matti Way and bassist Eric Flesy were recruited to fill Ugartechea's dual role. The band wrote new material for their second demo 95 Demo, which was distributed worldwide. Disgorge played many shows throughout 1995 to broaden their fan base, and in 1996 recorded the first four tracks of Cranial Impalement which was not released at the time, but was later distributed by Extremities Productions. In 1997, Freithoffer and Flesy left the band. Myers and Way began looking for new replacements, who were found in late 1998. Guitarist Diego Sanchez and bassist Ben Marlin of Strangulation, a local death metal band, decided to join Disgorge. Disgorge then signed with Unique Leader Records, and shortly after released their full-length album, She Lay Gutted, in November 1999. After the release of that album, the band toured in Europe, North America and South America. Way quit the band in 2001, and was replaced by A.J. Magana, ex-vocalist of Deprecated. Disgorge recorded their third album, Consume the Forsaken, with Magana as the vocalist. Magana parted ways with the band soon after recording. Their fourth album, Parallels of Infinite Torture, featured new vocalist Levi Fuselier and guitarist Ed Talorda. Disgorge played in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Mexico, and Indonesia in support of the album. The band appeared in the opening scene of the film Paranormal Activity, performing the song \\"Consume The Forsaken\\". On January 2, 2008, bassist Ben Marlin died, aged 31, after battling cancer for more than a year and a half. Sanchez, Talorda, and Way, along with Oscar Ramirez and Scott Ellis of Warface, formed To Violently Vomit; a Disgorge tribute band. Magana also performed vocals for a few shows, as did Angel Ochoa of Condemned. They debuted on September 11, 2009, at The Jumping Turtle in San Marcos, California, and continued playing in the southern California area.

History =1989 to 2001: Ashdown School= The school was first opened as Ashdown School on 7 July 1989 following the merger of Ashley Cross Girls School and Seldown Boys School. The name 'Ashdown' is a combination of the two previous school names. The construction of Ashdown School began in 1986 in a large field in Canford Heath, Poole, Dorset. During construction, a time capsule was placed somewhere within the brick walls, the capsule being removed from its previous location in Seldown Boys School. Fifty ash trees were planted around the border of the school's field, to represent the school's new name. On 7 July 1989, the new Ashdown School was opened by Princess Margaret and headteacher Mollie Snell. Six hundred students attended the opening of the school. In 1990, Snell retired from her post as headteacher. Ashley Pellegrini, previously deputy headteacher of Mellow Lane Comprehensive School in Hayes, Middlesex, became the new head. In 1995, the Charter Mark Award was given to Ashdown for Excellence in Public Service. On 7 October 1997, two arsonists set fire to the school overnight, closing the school for a week. Parts of the building were badly damaged and the music room destroyed. New facilities were constructed in 1999, with a new music room and five new classrooms added. The school received a second Charter Mark Award in 1998. In 2000, the school was presented a DfES School Improvement Award. =2000 to 2013: Ashdown Technology College= In 2001, under the DfES; Specialist Schools programme, Ashdown became a Technology College and changed its name to Ashdown Technology College. New technology is added in several classrooms, including interactive whiteboards. In 2005 Ashdown was recognised by the Specialist Schools Trust as one of the \\"Most Improved\\" and \\"Best Added Value\\" Schools in the country. The DfEs also designated Ashdown as a High Performing Specialist School. Near the end of the school term, In 2006 Ashdown was redesignated as a Technology College with Vocational Learning added to its specialisms. A Sixth Form was introduced. Headteacher Pellegrini was replaced in 2007 by Liz Jones. In 2012 Ashdown Technology College was placed in special measures after Ofsted assessed the school as \\"inadequate\\" for overall effectiveness. =2013 onwards: Magna Academy= Previously a community school administered by Poole Borough Council, in September 2013 Ashdown Technology College converted to academy status and was renamed Magna Academy. The school is now sponsored by the Aspirations Trust.https://www.aspirationsacademies.org/ Aspirations Trust In 2015, the academy underwent its first Ofsted inspection. It gained an Outstanding rating, the highest award the inspector can give to a school. In September 2015, the academy received national media attention after it removed students from classes for having incorrectly sized classroom equipment. An Ofted inspection in December 2018 again rated the academy Outstanding, endorsing its polarising silent corridors policy. Students were expected to transition between classrooms in silence, arriving at their next lesson calm and ready to work. The policy was also a reaction to the commonly held belief among educators that most bullying at school occurs in the transitions between lessons. According to the report that followed its inspection, Principal Richard Tutt stated that \\"some of our students have come from schools where they had been subjected to verbal and physical aggression in transitions. In the summer of 2019, Richard Tutt left the Academy to pursue a new role with a competitor Trust. After a term under interim management, the Academy appointed Natasha Ullah as Principal. Ms Ullah joined the school from the Thomas Hardye School in Dorchester. She is the first BAME headteacher to be appointed on England's South Coast. In the wake of the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic, Magna Academy was obliged to temporarily close its doors to students from 20 March 2020. Its early and rapid preparation for closure allowed it to launch a Virtual School on its website at the point of closure.

Reams served as a U.S. Congressman from Ohio from 1951 to 1955. Life and career Reams was born in Franklin, Tennessee in 1897. His father was a Methodist minister. Reams served in the United States Army, with the 58th Field Artillery, during World War I, in 1918‚Äì1919. He was discharged at the rank of lieutenant. After the war, Reams finished his degree at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, earning a bachelor's degree in 1919. In 1922, he received a law degree from Vanderbilt University. In 1920, Reams was licensed to practice law in Tennessee. In 1922, he moved to Toledo, Ohio, where his brother Glenn was a medical resident at the Toledo Hospital. Reams was admitted to the bar and practiced law with the firm Tracy, Chapman & Welles. He practiced as a lawyer while participating in Democratic politics, serving as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940, 1944, 1948, and 1956. From 1933 to 1937, Reams served as prosecutor of Lucas County, Ohio. During this time, Reams led a campaign to clean up Toledo and rid the city of the many gangsters and bootleggers who resided and did business there. Reams was most well known for leading the prosecution of Thomas \\"Yonnie\\" Licavoli, who controlled bootlegging and illegal gambling operations in Detroit, Michigan and Toledo. Licavoli was sentenced to life in prison and served a 37-year sentence at Ohio Penitentiary starting in 1935. Gov. Martin L. Davey appointed Reams to investigate easy prison conditions and Reams's investigation of the luxuries that Licavoli was benefitting from at the Ohio Penitentiary resulted in the dismissal of the warden. In 1935, Reams got into a public dispute with Lucas County Common Pleas Court Judge Roy R. Stuart. A grand jury convened by County Prosecutor Reams had issued indictments of two brothers of Toledo Mayor Addison Q. Thacher, a Republican, on charges related to welfare payments and bank closings. Judge Stuart ordered the dismissal of the grand jury and Reams filed an \\"affidavit of prejudice,\\" which prevented Stuart from hearing any criminal matter until the accusation of prejudice could be heard. In 1936, Reams sought the Democratic nomination for the office of Ohio Attorney General, but he lost to Herbert S. Duffy. In 1937, Reams formed the law firm Reams, Bretherton & Neipp. His partners were Thomas A. Bretherton and Morton Neipp, both of whom had worked for him in the prosecutor's office. From 1939 to 1945 he served on the Toledo Port Commission. From 1942 to 1944, he was collector of internal revenue. In 1944, Reams sought the Democratic nomination for Governor of Ohio, but he placed fourth in the contest that was won by Frank Lausche. Once Lausche won the governorship, he appointed Reams to the office of state director of public welfare, where Reams served from 1945 to 1946. In 1950, Reams was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as an independent, beginning his service in the 82nd Congress. He served in the House from 1951 to 1955, representing the ninth congressional district of Ohio, being re-elected in 1952. However, in 1954, Reams was unsuccessful in his bid for a third term in Congress, losing his seat to a fellow Democrat, Thomas Ludlow Ashley. In 1951, Reams served as a delegate to the Council of Europe. In 1953 and 1954, he was a delegate to the Interparliamentary Union Conference. From 1937 to 1960, Reams served on the board of the Community Broadcasting Co. (the operator of WTOL and WCWA radio and WTOL TV), which he had founded in 1928. In 1955, Reams was one of the founding directors of the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority. From 1948 to 1957, he was a trustee of Bowling Green State University. From 1965 until his death, he was chairman of the board of Reams Broadcasting Corp. After his retirement, Reams moved to San Mateo, California. He died in Oakland, California in 1971 and was buried in the Woodlawn Cemetery (Toledo, Ohio). Reams's son, Frazier Reams Jr., was the Democratic nominee for Ohio governor in 1966.

He also played with the Hanshin Tigers in the Japanese Central League in 2000. He is currently the manager of the Class A-Advanced Lake Elsinore Storm. Early life Tarasco was born at Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in Greenwich Village and, until he was 6 or 7 years old, lived in Washington Heights and the Bronx. His father, Jack, worked a summer job as a vendor at Yankee Stadium. At 13 years old, after moving to Santa Monica, California, Tarasco joined the Santa Monica Graveyard Crips, a set of the Crips street gang. At 16 years old, with the encouragement of fellow Crips members, he left the gang to focus on playing high school baseball. Tarasco was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the 15th round of the 1988 Major League Baseball draft out of Santa Monica High School. Professional career Tarasco was involved in a controversial play in the 1996 American League Championship Series while playing right field for the Baltimore Orioles. While fielding a fly ball hit by New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the fence and caught the ball. The umpires called a home run, although the correct call was fan interference. The play was the turning point in the series, which the Yankees won. Tarasco spent the remainder of his career as a part time player, often shuttling between the major and minor leagues. Tarasco and Jeter were teammates for a short time during the 1999 season.Baseball Reference In June 2002, Tarasco's New York Mets teammate Mark Corey suffered a seizure after the two players smoked marijuana outside of Shea Stadium. Under Major League Baseball drug policy at the time, because both players were first-time offenders, they were not subject to discipline from the league. Tarasco began working for the Washington Nationals in or around 2005. For a time, Tarasco was the minor league coordinator for the Nationals.Nats officials make unfortunate Harper comparisons. Washington Examiner, July 2011. On November 14, 2012, the Nationals announced that Tarasco would join their coaching staff in the 2013 season to coach first base and outfield.

The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit is a United States national forest that manages and protects public land surrounding Lake Tahoe and the Lake Tahoe Basin. Straddling the state borders of California and Nevada in the Sierra Nevada, the LTBMU encompasses 154,851 acres (626 km¬≤) of National Forest system lands, ranging in altitude above sea level from 6,225 feet at lake level to 10,881 feet at Freel Peak. The U.S. Forest Service established the LTBMU in 1973. The name of the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit reflects a unique sort of National Forest, as unique as the resources of the Tahoe Basin.  Goals  The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) is responsible for the conservation, preservation and restoration of the Lake Tahoe watershed ecosystem within National Forest Lands. Projects and programs also include habitat, fire management, and urban lot management. Additionally the LTBMU provides and maintains high quality recreational opportunities for millions of visitors and residents annually. Compared to other National Forest Lands the LTBMU is small, yet it is the Tahoe Basin's largest land manager, responsible for 78% of basin lands. As such the Forest Service has the largest single role in ecosystem and watershed management and protection. The LTBMU is a part of the National Forest System, yet is managed somewhat differently than other National Forests. Many common forest activities such as mining, grazing or timber harvesting are either not a part of LTBMU management or play a very small role. Since the lake is so dependent on all that happens around it, LTBMU programs manage the whole of the basin as a complete inter-dependent system. The LTBMU is a unique inter-mix of forest and urban communities, presenting challenges and complexities few other National Forests experience. Since its establishment in 1973, the LTBMU has become a pioneer and leader in the science of forest and ecosystem management. The work of the Forest Service supports and is supported by many partners. Other federal, state and local agencies are working together in the effort to face challenges, conserve and restore natural and cultural resources, and enhance the recreational values of the Lake Tahoe Basin. History In 1899 President William McKinley created the Lake Tahoe Forest Reserve, becoming the core of later National Forest Lands in the Tahoe Basin. Three separate forests were developed out of the reserve, the Tahoe, Eldorado and Toiyabe National Forests. Each of these forests extended into the basin and managed separate sections. In 1973, the LTBMU was created from basin portions of the three existing National Forests, forming a single \\"management unit.\\" This unification provided the focus needed for the basin, and more effective management of its watershed, ecological and recreational values. The name \\"Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit\\" was originally a temporary one, but after three decades, the name remains.

Geography About 85% of Plumas National Forest lies in Plumas County, but smaller portions are found in eastern Butte, northern Sierra, southern Lassen, and northeastern Yuba counties. Management The land is managed by the United States Forest Service under the Department of Agriculture with local management stationed at the Plumas National Forest Supervisor's office in Quincy, California. The forest is also subdivided into three Ranger Districts, the Beckwourth Ranger District, the Feather Falls Ranger District and the Mt.

This connected Philadelphia and Trenton, NJ at one end of the shortline railroad to the rapidly growing lower Wyoming Valley region, and via the Morris Canal or the CNJ, a slow or fast connection to New York City ferries crossing New York Harbor from Jersey City, NJ. In 1871 the CNJ leased various railroads in Pennsylvania, most from the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company allowing the CNJ to penetrate to the upper Wyoming Valley, over some stretches, competing directly with the Lehigh Valley Railroad and with the Lehigh Canal and the trunk road connection of the to New York became less profitable since Philadelphia connected more easily to Northeastern Pennsylvania thereafter without needing a double-crossing of the Delaware River; a general revenue decline ensued, leading to the Pennsylvania Railroad acquiring the rights, where it served as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) system, carrying mainly anthracite coal and iron ore from northeastern Pennsylvania to population centers along the coast. History Lambertville station =Early history= The Belvidere-Delaware Railroad was chartered on March 2, 1836 and was constructed between 1850 and 1855 from Trenton along the Delaware River north to Belvidere, New Jersey. The Trenton-Lambertville section opened on February 6, 1851, eventually reaching Belvidere on November 5, 1855. On June 7, 1854, the Bel-Del agreed to operate the Flemington Railroad and Transportation Company, where a connection was made with the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) at Flemington, New Jersey. LV coal trains began using the Bel-Del in January 1856, joining the Bel-Del by the LV's bridge over the Delaware River where it connected in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. An extension was then completed in 1864 that gave the Bel-Del access to the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W;) at Manunka Chunk, and permitted trains to operate via trackage rights to East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania through the Delaware Water Gap. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) began operating the Bel Del as the Belvidere Division of the United Railroads of New Jersey Grand Division in 1871 and purchased the line soon afterwards. The Belvidere-Delaware Railroad and the Flemington Railroad & Transportation Company then merged on February 16, 1885 to form the Belvidere Delaware Railroad. For much of the late 19th century and early 20th century the railroad line proved vitally useful. In 1889 the Lehigh & Hudson River Railway made a deal with PRR to operate on the Bel-Del between Phillipsburg and Belvidere where L&HR;'s track to Maybrook, New York connects. By the 1950s steam locomotives had been replaced with diesel operated self-propelled doodlebugs as a cost-saving measure resulting from dwindling patronage. In August 1955, flood waters from the Delaware River caused by Hurricane Diane washed out portions of the line north of Belvidere near where the right-of-way crosses modern-day US Route 46, although the line still remains active south of this point to serve the Hoffmann-LaRoche pharmaceutical plant. North of where the plant is now to the junction at Manunka Chunk, the line was subsequently removed in late 1955. On December 31, 1957, the Bel-Del was merged into the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company, with passenger services ending by October 25, 1960. Heritage operator Black River & Western Railroad (BR&W;) began leasing the Flemington Branch from PRR on weekends to operate steam excursions. As part of the leasing agreement, BR&W; was required to pay PRR for all track expenses, totalling $5,000. Trains began operating between Flemington and Lambertville by May 16, 1965. =Decline= The PRR merged with rival New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form the Penn Central (PC), which fell apart faster than it came together. PC remnants were absorbed by Conrail in April 1976, which treated the Bel-Del as a dispensable secondary line. The chief function of the Bel-Del ‚Äî bringing coal and iron ore between the LV connection at Phillipsburg with the PRR system ‚Äî had long since ceased. The main priority freight trains were rerouted to other lines. With little industry remaining between Trenton and Milford, Conrail had little use for the line. Though the south end of line passed within a few hundred yards from the central business district and state capitol complex in Trenton, no official interest in taking advantage of the line's passenger potential was raised. When it became known that Conrail was planning to abandon the Bel-Del, the BR&W; purchased approximately three miles of track in the Lambertville area to continue to serve several freight customers located in town. (The BR&W; had already purchased the 11-mile line between Flemington and Lambertville from PC in March 1970 for $153,000.) Conrail ceased interchanging with BR&W; in early 1977 when a new connection opened at Three Bridges, eventually abandoning the line south of Milford to Trenton in November 1978 after doing a final inspection of the Milford-Lambertville segment with a service train before dismantlement. Track removal began in the summer of 1979 and ended in the spring of 1982. In those three years Conrail dismantled 32 miles of the line. The former railroad bed was converted for use as part of the Delaware & Raritan Canal Trail. Conrail renamed the Belvidere Branch their Delaware Secondary in the early 1980s from Milford to Belvidere. =Current= Conrail later sold the Phillipsburg-Milford section to the newly formed Belvidere & Delaware River Railway (BDRV) in 1995. In 1998, BR&W; ceased regular operations into Lambertville when track was demoted to excepted prohibiting the continuation of passenger trains on that segment of the line. Freight service was non-existent by the late 1990s. Service trains operated over the Ringoes-Lambertville portion on a seldom basis until 2002. BDRV served a paper plant south of Milford, New Jersey, until 2003 when the paper mill closed. The line south of Carpentersville was soon after closed to Riegelsville in 2005 when another paper plant decided to not continue using rail service. Flooding also partially damaged the line in the Riegelsville area at the time. The New York Susquehanna & Western Historical & Technical Society (NYS&WH;&TS;) started running passenger trains in 2004 between Phillipsburg and Carpentersville and has since become a successful operation. In recent years both the NYSWHTS and the Black River Railroad Historical Trust (the entity that now runs passenger trains on BR&W;) have been gradually restoring the dormant Milford and Lambertville lines. Norfolk Southern (NS) retains ownership of the Phillipsburg-Belvidere main line after the Conrail split of 1999 with CSX Transportation. They continue to use the line serving several customers in Martins Creek accessed by the former Lehigh & New England Railroad Martins Creek Branch, Roxburg via a spur over the river and Belvidere. NS also interchanges with the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad in Portland, PA, via the former Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Bangor- Portland Division. =Former stations= Pennsylvania * East Stroudsburg (via trackage rights over DL&W;) New Jersey * Manunka Chunk * Belvidere * Foul Rift * Roxburg * Hutchinson * Brainards * Harmony * Phillipsburg * Lehigh Junction * Carpentersville * Riegelsville * Holland * Milford * Frenchtown * Kingwood * Tumble Falls * Byram * Raven Rock * Stockton * Lambertville * Moore * Titusville * Washington's Crossing * Somerset * Scudder Falls * Wilburtha * Dix Haven * Cadwalader Park * Trenton (on PRR New York Division, today's Amtrak Northeast Corridor) Flemington Branch (current BR&W;) * Lambertville (on Bel-Del mainline) * Alexauken * Mount Airy * Bowne * Boss Road * Ringoes * Copper Hill * Muirheid * Flemington References Further reading *Strunk, Keith (2008), Prallsville Mills and Stockton (Aracadia Publishing) *Mastrich, James Warren, Yvonne Kline, George (1996), Lambertville & New Hope (Aracadia Publishing) *J.

The structure was then thought to be a double mastaba and was not excavated very thoroughly. Seventy years later the Czech Institute conducted a thorough excavation of the site. The construction of the pyramid was likely started during the reign of her husband Neferirkare Kakai and finished during the reign of her son Nyuserre Ini. The pyramid was robbed during the First Intermediate Period. During the Middle Kingdom the pyramid was reopened and the sarcophagus reused for the burial of a young child. By the end of the New Kingdom the destruction of the site occurred when stones were taken from the site to be reused elsewhere. The mortuary temple of Khentkaues II was decorated, but the reliefs were damaged and what remains, are a collection of fragments. The scenes included depictions of offerings, a funeral meal, agricultural scenes, the procession of funerary estates, and the family of king Nyuserre greeting his mother.

The bodies of Sikorski's daughter, chief of staff and other key aides purportedly on the plane were never found, Baliszewski, Dawid, \\"Bransoletka Zofii\\" (\\"Zofia's Bracelet\\"), Tygodnik Wprost, no. 1152 (December 31, 2004) Retrieved on March 24, 2005. and the plane's only survivor, the pilot, had uncharacteristically worn his life preserver in the cockpit. Sabotage and a possible assassination have been suspected, with Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, or even rival factions in the Polish government in exile theorized to have been involved. Poland reopened the case in 2008; an exhumation of Sikorski's body found his injuries consistent with death from an air crash, ruling out some theories that he had been killed before being put on the plane, but the investigators still could not rule out the possibility of sabotage. British files on the case will remain sealed until 2050. * Emil H√°cha (72), a Czech lawyer, the third President of Czechoslovakia from 1938 to 1939, who died in Pankr√°c Prison on 27 June 1945Emil Hacha, hrad.cz, retrieved 20 November 2013 under mysterious circumstances, and his death cause remains unknown. Hacha had collaborated with the Nazis during the German occupation, and had been arrested by the Red Army after the liberation of Prague. * King Ananda Mahidol of Thailand, died of gunshot wounds; suicide, accident or assassination on 9 June 1946. Mahidol's successor King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Prime Minister Pridi Banomyong, and the former Japanese intelligence officer Masanobu Tsuji have alternatively been accused of complicity. * The Body in the cylinder refers to a male decedent discovered within a partially sealed steel cylinder on a derelict WWII bomb site in Liverpool, England. The discovery was made on 13 July 1945 and it is believed that the body had lain undiscovered for 60 years. Inquiries named a strong (but unconfirmed) candidate for the identity of the decedent; however, the cause of death and the reason for their presence in the cylinder remain a mystery. * The Trow Ghyll skeleton, discovered in a cave in rural north Yorkshire, England in 1947, remains unidentified. In the Highest Degree Odious by A. W. B. Simpson (Oxford University Press, 1992) The death probably occurred in 1941; the fact that the body was discovered with a glass bottle of cyanide has led to speculation that it was someone connected with espionage. Jan Masaryk * Jan Masaryk (61), 1948, son of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk; Czech diplomat, politician and Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia, was found dead in the courtyard of the Foreign Ministry below his bathroom window.Axelrod, Alan (2009) The Real History of the Cold War: A New Look at the Past, p. 133 New York: Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. The initial investigation concluded that he committed suicide by jumping out of the window, although many are convinced that he was pushed. A new investigation by the Czechoslovak government after the Velvet Revolution ruled his death a murder. * Sadanori Shimoyama, 1948, first director of Japanese National Railways, was last seen leaving his official car to go into a department store on his way to work the morning of 5 July of that year. Others reported seeing him at various train stations, and walking along one line, that afternoon. His dismembered body was found at noon the next day on the J≈çban Line. It had indisputably gotten that way as a result of being struck by a train, but the autopsy suggested he had died before being struck. That conclusion has been disputed, and whether his death was a suicide or murder remains undetermined. =1950‚Äì1974= *In 1951 human bones were found and were thought to be the remains of Percy Fawcett (57), who had disappeared on 29 May 1925 in Mato Grosso, Brazil, This was proven to be untrue and they remain unidentified. * Indian politician Syama Prasad Mukherjee (52), died in a prison hospital 23 June 1953, one and a half months after his arrest for attempting to enter Jammu and Kashmir without a permit. The exact cause of death has never been disclosed; Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, whose government Mukherjee had resigned from in protest over Nehru's decision to normalise relations with Pakistan despite that country's treatment of its Hindu population, said at the time he made inquiries and was satisfied that his former minister's death was due to natural causes; speculation has continued that Mukherjee was actually murdered due to some unusual circumstances of his arrest and treatment. * The Dyatlov Pass incident was the deaths of nine hikers on the Kholat Syakhl mountain in the northern Ural Mountains range on 2 February 1959; all the bodies were not recovered until that May. While most of the victims were found to have died of hypothermia after apparently abandoning their tent high on an exposed mountainside, two had fractured skulls, two had broken ribs, and one was missing her tongue. After testing, the clothing of some of the victims was found to be highly radioactive. There were no witnesses or survivors to provide any testimony, and the cause of death was listed as a \\"compelling natural force\\", most likely an avalanche, by Soviet investigators. The Lane Cove River. The bodies of Dr Gilbert Bogle and Margaret Chandler were discovered at this location on 1 January 1963 * Barth√©lemy Boganda (48), who was Prime Minister of the Central African Republic died on 29 March 1959Aboard were four crew and five passengers, including the government's information chief and a member of parliament. in Boukpayanga during a mysterious plane crash. *Dag Hammarskj√∂ld (56), a Swedish economist and diplomat who served as the second Secretary- General of the United Nations died on 18 September 1961 in Ndola, Northern Rhodesia in a mysterious plane crash. * Dr Gilbert Stanley Bogle (39), and Margaret Olive Chandler (29), were found dead, both partially undressed, near the banks of the Lane Cove River in Sydney, Australia, on 1 January 1963. Their bluish pallor and the presence of vomit and excrement led to a finding that they had been poisoned, but the coroner was unable to determine what the toxin was. It was suspected they had been murdered (possibly by Chandler's husband) although no suspect has ever been identified.Butt, Peter. \\"Who Killed Dr Bogle & Mrs Chandler?\\" New Holland Publishers,Sydney, October 2012 A 2006 TV documentary suggested their deaths were not due to foul play but the result of hydrogen sulfide gas leaking from the river bed and reaching dangerously high concentrations in the low-lying depressions where their bodies were found. * The Lead Masks Case involves the death of two Brazilian electronic technicians, Manoel Pereira da Cruz and Miguel Jos√© Viana, whose bodies were discovered on 20 August 1966, in Niter√≥i, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After an autopsy was performed the cause of death could not be proven since the organs were too badly ruined.According to a 2004 TV special: Linha Direta Justi√ßa ‚Äì M√°scaras de Chumbo *Alvar Larsson (13), was a Swedish boy who disappeared on 16 April 1967 while going for a walk. In November 1982, a human skull was found on a small island 6 km away that was identified as belonging to Larsson. The disappearance attracted a lot of media coverage at the time and many theories as to what happened have been put forward. Thomas Quick has confessed to the crime, but has recanted all his confessions. * Oakland, California, police officer John Frey was fatally shot on the morning of 28 October 1967, during a traffic stop where he had pulled over Black Panther leader Huey P. Newton, who was wounded in the shootout and convicted of voluntary manslaughter the following year. The gun Newton purportedly used was never found, and following two hung juries after the conviction was overturned on appeal in 1970 the district attorney's office announced it would not try him a fourth time. Newton suggested that Frey may have been shot by his partner; there has been no new investigation to determine whether this was the case and whether this was an accident. *Joan Robinson Hill (38), was a Texas socialite who died in 1969. At first ruled to have died of influenza following a brief hospitalization on 19 March, suspicions were aroused when her body was released to the funeral home and embalmed before a legally required autopsy could be carried out. Despite the compromised evidence, three autopsies, all with their own irregularities, were performedThompson 1976, pp. 117‚Äì118 and her husband John eventually became the only person indicted by a Texas grand jury for murder by omission, or failing to take proper action in the face of a life-threatening situation. The first attempt to prosecute him ended in a mistrial in 1972; he was murdered before he could be retried and the gunman who was suspected of his murder died in a police shootout. Two other alleged accomplices were later convicted. *Edward Mutesa (45), who was Kabaka of the Kingdom of Buganda in Uganda died on 21 November 1969 from alcohol poisoning, in his London flat. He may have committed suicide or been poisoned by someone. *Mustafa Zaidi (40), Pakistani Urdu poet from India who died in Karachi from unknown reasons on 12 October 1970. The case has never been solved. *Ronald Hughes (35), was an American attorney who disappeared while on a camping trip in November 1970. He had been representing Leslie Van Houten in the Tate‚ÄìLaBianca murder trial. His body was found in March 1971, but his cause of death could not be determined. *The Isdal Woman was a partially charred unidentified corpse found on 29 November 1970, hidden off a hiking trail near Bergen, Norway. The official conclusion that her death was a suicide has not been widely accepted, since some believed she was murdered. Her identity remains unknown and is considered one of Norway's most profound mysteries, the case has been the subject of intense speculation for many years. Multiple investigations point to the possibility that she was a spy. *Giangiacomo Feltrinelli (45), who had during the 1950s published the smuggled manuscript of Boris Pasternak's novel Doctor Zhivago, but later became a left-wing militant during Italy's Years of Lead, was found dead at the base of a power- line transmission tower outside Segrate, near his native Milan, on 15 March 1972. It was believed that he had died when a bomb he was attempting to plant on the tower went off, and later testimony by other members of the Red Brigades supported this. However, the death was always viewed suspiciously, and in the 2010s forensic reports surfaced that suggested he had been tied to the tower before the bomb went off, with various intelligence agencies inside and outside of Italy suspected of responsibility. *Kafundanga Chingunji, served as the first Chief of Staff in the government of UNITA, pro-Western rebels, during the Angolan Civil War. Officially, Chingunji died from cerebral malaria in January 1974 on Angola's border with Zambia. His wife and others who saw his body say someone poisoned Chingunji. Rumors later alleged Jonas Savimbi, the head of UNITA, ordered his assassination.Brittain, Victoria (1998). Death of Dignity: Angola's Civil War. p. 17. It is unknown for sure what the exact circumstances of the death are. *Nuclear power whistleblower Karen Silkwood (28), died in a car accident on 13 November 1974, while driving to a meeting with a New York Times reporter in Oklahoma City. Whether that accident involved another vehicle, whose driver may have deliberately run her off the road, or resulted from her own fatigue, remains a matter of debate. *Aman Andom (50), was an Ethiopian military figure and was the acting head of state of Ethiopia who died on 23 November 1974. Sources say that he committed suicide, while others say that he was killed by political rivals among the coup leadership, possibly including Mengistu Haile Mariam. =1975‚Äì1999= *Alexandra \\"Sasha\\" Bell (29), a daughter of David K.

His death that took place on 27 August 1975 was officially announced as the result of natural causes, but a persistent allegation is that he was smothered with a pillow. * Marcia Moore (50), a writer on yoga and astrology, disappeared near her home in the Seattle, Washington, area during the winter of 1979.Rule, Ann. A Rage To Kill And Other True Cases, Pocket Books (1999), , pp. 269-270. Her skeletal remains were found in nearby woods in 1981. It has been presumed in the absence of any evidence that would more conclusively establish a cause of death, that she died of hypothermia while wandering the woods under the influence of ketamine, a drug whose use she had promoted. However, true-crime writer Ann Rule, a friend, says what appeared to be a bullet hole was found in her jawbone, although authorities said it could just as easily have been a result of the bone decaying during the cold winters. Officially the cause of Moore's death remains undetermined. *Douglas Crofut (38), American radiographer who died of both radiation poisoning and radiation burns on 27 July 1981 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The event is thought to have been either a suicide or murder, but this remains uncertain. *Omar Torrijos (52), who was brigadier general and president of Panama, died in a plane crash on 31 July 1981 under mysterious circumstances. Natalie Wood. Her husband has been named as a person of interest in her death * On 29 November 1981, actress Natalie Wood (43), who was a passenger on the yacht owned by her and her husband Robert Wagner, was found drowned near Santa Catalina Island, California. Two other people were on board the Wagners‚Äô yacht at the time: actor Christopher Walken and Dennis Davern, a longtime employee of the Wagners who served as skipper of the yacht. While drowning has always been accepted as the direct cause of her death, the circumstances under which she went into the water have never been clear, and after reopening the investigation in 2012 the coroner changed the cause of death from \\"accident\\" to \\"undetermined\\", based on cuts and bruises on her body that may or may not have been suffered before her death. In 2018, Wagner was identified as a person of interest. *Eduardo Frei Montalva (71), was president of Chile from 1964 to 1970 died on 22 January 1982. As of 2005, his death is being investigated because of allegations that he was poisoned. * The cause of death of the baby born to Joanne Hayes in Ireland's 1984 Kerry Babies case was never established. *The YOGTZE case refers to the death of unemployed German food engineer G√ºnther Stoll (34), which occurred on 26 October 1984.

He was fully clothed. Among others, the drug Lorazepam was found in his system. The circumstances of his death remain unclear and controversial, with suicide or murder both considered possible explanations and the case still being investigated in both directions. * Whether the 17 August 1988 plane crash that killed Pakistani president Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (64), the country's longest-serving leader, and 30 others including the country's top military leaders and the U.S. ambassador, was an accident or foul play, the result of sabotage or a shootdown, is a matter of debate. American investigators came to the former conclusion, while their Pakistani counterparts produced a report reaching the latter. Theories as to responsibility if it were an act of malice have put the blame on a number of domestic and foreign actors. *Said S. Bedair (40), was an Egyptian scientist in electrical, electronic and microwave engineering and a colonel in the Egyptian army. He died on 14 July 1989 in Alexandria of unclear circumstances, though his wife thinks it might have been a suicide. * A skull fragment found in a wooded area of Baldwin, Pennsylvania in 1992 turned out to be that of Michael Rosenblum (25), of nearby Pittsburgh, who had not been seen since 14 February 1980, near where the bone was found. While the cause of death could not be determined, circumstantial evidence accumulated over the years suggested that Baldwin's police department had covered up its own officers' involvement in Rosenblum's disappearance; the chief was fired over the allegations and reinstated a short time later. * Zviad Gamsakhurdia (54), former president of Georgia, died in 1993 from circumstances that remain very unclear. It is known that he died in the village of Khibula in the Samegrelo region of western Georgia. *Caroline Byrne (24), was an Australian model, was found at the bottom of a cliff at The Gap in Sydney on 8 June 1995. Her boyfriend at the time of her death was charged with killing her and was convicted, but was acquitted of the conviction in February 2012 as the decision was overturned.. It is unclear to whether her death is a murder or suicide. *Rock County John Doe, commonly referred as John Clinton Doe, was the name given to an unidentified set of skeletal remains estimated to be a young adult or teenage white male, which were found alongside Turtle Creek near Clinton, Rock County, Wisconsin on 26 November 1995. His death cause is also unknown. *Green Boots is the name given to the unidentified corpse of a climber that became a landmark on the main Northeast ridge route of Mount Everest. Though his identity has not been officially confirmed, he is believed to be Tsewang Paljor, an Indian climber who died on Mount Everest in 1996. * Screenwriter Gary DeVore (55), left Santa Fe, New Mexico, on 28 June 1997, for Hollywood to drop off his final draft of the script for a remake of The Big Steal, a 1950 film about, in part, a man who stages his own disappearance. He never arrived, and was considered missing for a year until his body was found in his car in the California Aqueduct. His hands were missing, and it did not appear from the position in which it was found that the car had gone into the waterway after an accident. No cause of death has been conclusively established. * Dimitris Liantinis (55), disappeared on 1 June 1998. In July 2005 human bones were found in the area of the mountain Taygetos; forensic examinations verified that it was the body of Liantinis. No lethal substances were found to determine the cause of death.Dimitris Liantinis ‚Äì Short BiographyBiography at Philosophia.gr *Kevin Hjalmarsson (4), Swedish boy who after going missing was found dead in Arvika on 16 August 1998. Though he was originally thought to have been murdered, it is now claimed by the police that he is thought to have died of an unknown accident. * Yves Godard, was a French doctor who disappeared from a sailing boat with his two children in September 1999. Several years later, bones belonging to Dr Godard and his daughter were discovered in the English Channel. No trace of his son or his wife (the latter did not go on the sailing trip and stayed at home) has ever been found, nor has any trace of the boat. However, investigators found traces of blood in the family home and in Godard's caravan, raising suspicion that Godard's wife was murdered. In 2012, the case was closed without charges. Prosecutors ruled out accidental death and believe that Dr Godard probably murdered his family before committing suicide at sea, but they also acknowledge that they are not certain of this. =2000‚Äì2010= *Lolo Ferrari (37) was a French dancer, singer, and film actress who also performed in pornography and was known for her large surgically-enhanced breasts. Ferrari was found deceased on the morning of 5 March, 2000, of causes which have never been determined. *Rodney Marks (32), an Australian astrophysicist, died of a sudden illness on 12 May 2000 at Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station in Antarctica. It was not possible for his body to be flown to New Zealand and autopsied until after the Antarctic winter ended six months later; the cause of death was found to have been methanol poisoning. Suicide was ruled out as he did not seem to have a motive and had readily sought treatment for his apparent illness, nor did an accidental overdose seem likely either as there was plenty of alcoholic drink available for consumption at the base should he have wanted it. The New Zealand police believed instead that the methanol had been \\"unknowingly\\" introduced into Marks' system, but could not conclusively call the case a homicide. Further investigation has been frustrated by the refusal of American agencies to share their findings, the global dispersal of researchers and personnel at the base that winter, the 2006 disappearance of the doctor who treated Marks, and the loss of any possible crime-scene evidence during the winter after Marks' death. *On 11 August 2001, Irish musician Paul Cunniffe (40), formerly of the bands Blaze X and the Saw Doctors, died in a fall in the London neighborhood of Whitechapel. The circumstances that led to the fall, or even exactly where it occurred, however, remain unknown. His is one of several deaths among friends and acquaintances of Pete Doherty. Forensic facial reconstruction of Tempe Girl *Tempe Girl is the name given to an unidentified decedent whose body was discovered on 27 April 2002 in Tempe, Arizona. She had died of cocaine intoxication‚Äîruled to be neither an accident nor a homicide‚Äîone day before the discovery of her body. She is believed to have been of either Hispanic or Native American ethnicity and was allegedly picked up while hitchhiking, claiming she had been effectively disowned by her own mother for her frequent recreational drug use. *Abu Nidal (65), Palestinian terrorist leader behind the 1985 Rome and Vienna airport attacks, already suffering from leukemia, was reported to have died from a gunshot wound in Baghdad on 16 August 2002. Iraq's government at the time claimed his death was a suicide; the Fatah Revolutionary Council Nidal founded claimed he was assassinated on Saddam Hussein's orders to prevent his possible capture during the American invasion of Iraq that began six months later. *Jeremiah Duggan (23), a British student studying in Paris, was found dead on a highway in Wiesbaden, Germany, early on 27 March 2003. The initial investigation concluded he had committed suicide by running into traffic. However, his mother, noting that he had called her in great distress over his involvement with the LaRouche movement, who may have discovered that he was British and Jewish, within an hour of his death, never accepted that theory, and a later investigation found evidence that the accident may have been staged to cover an earlier beating. The case was reopened in 2012 after extensive litigation in England, resulting in a change of the cause of death to \\"unexplained\\", with the note that Duggan may have been involved in some sort of \\"altercation\\" beforehand.Varney, Merry. \\"Coroner rejects suicide at inquest into British student found dead in Germany\\", press release, Leigh Day, 22 May 2015. via misadventure *J√ºrgen M√∂llemann (57), German Free Democratic Party politician, died on 5 June 2003 in a parachuting incident at Marl-Lohm√ºhle. His death was investigated by the Essen district attorney's office, which published a final report on 9 July 2003. While outside interference was ruled out, no definite verdict was reached on whether M√∂llemann committed suicide or had died via misadventure. Shortly before his death, M√∂llemann, a passionate and experienced skydiver, had been confronted with allegations he had been involved in illegal arms deals and evaded taxes on millions of euros he allegedly earned from these activities. To enable a full investigation on these charges, the Bundestag lifted his parliamentary immunity on 5 June 2003 at 12:28, 22 minutes before his death. The tax evasion charges were dropped after his death. *Singer-songwriter Elliott Smith (34), died of stab wounds inflicted in his Echo Park, California, home on 21 October 2003. His girlfriend claims she got out of the shower after an argument, having heard him scream, to find him with the knife sticking out of his chest, and found a short suicide note on a Post-It shortly thereafter. While he did indeed have a history of depression and addiction, friends say he was actively working to finish an album at the time and seemed optimistic. The coroner found the stab wounds were inconsistent with a suicide attempt but could not say it was a homicide either; the cause of the stabbing remains undetermined and has not been further investigated. *Jonathan Luna (38), an assistant U.S. attorney from Baltimore, was found dead of multiple stab wounds inflicted with his own penknife in Denver, Pennsylvania, on the morning of 4 December 2003, in a stream underneath his car, which had been driven there overnight from Baltimore. The FBI, which has jurisdiction over the possible murder of any U.S. federal employee, found that Luna had mounting financial problems and was facing an investigation over missing money at his office, considered it a suicide or botched attempt at staging a kidnapping. However, the Lancaster County coroner's office, pointing to evidence suggesting he had been abducted and someone else was driving for at least the final stage of his drive, ruled it a homicide and considers the case open. *Lamduan Armitage was a formerly unidentified woman whose body was discovered in 2004 on the mountain Pen-y- ghent in Yorkshire, England, leading her to become known as the Lady of the Hills. The woman was found to have originally come from somewhere in South- East Asia, but despite an international police investigation, the identity of the woman, and how she arrived at the location remained a mystery until 2019. The woman was identified in March 2019 through DNA testing. Her cause of death remains unknown. *Alonzo Brooks (23), American man who went missing from La Cygne, Kansas on 3 April 2004 and was found dead about a month later on 1 May 2004. After the pathologists did an autopsy they have not yet been able to tell the cause of his death. *The coroner investigating the death of Richard Lancelyn Green (51), a British Arthur Conan Doyle scholar who was found garrotted with a shoelace on his bed in his home on 27 April 2004, returned an open verdict. Many of his friends and family suspected homicide as he had complained of someone following him in his efforts to stop the auction of a cache of Doyle's personal papers that he believed to have been wrongfully acquired. However, despite suicide by garrotte being unusual and difficult, some investigators believed that he had followed the example of one of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories in which a woman stages her suicide to look like a murder. *John Garang (60), Sudanese politician and former rebel revolutionary leader died on 30 July 2005 in New Cush, Sudan in a suspicious helicopter crash. *Barbara Precht (69), body was found on 29 November 2006 in Cincinnati, Ohio. She remained unidentified until November 2014. Her husband was located later on and is considered a person of interest in her death, which has unknown circumstances. *Joyce Carol Vincent (38), was found dead in her London flat in January 2006, two years after she had died, by which time the body had decomposed so much as to make identifying a cause of death impossible; her story was profiled in the 2011 documentary Dreams of a Life.Joyce Carol Vincent: How could this young woman lie dead and undiscovered for almost three years? Carol Morley, The Guardian, Sunday 9 October 2011 *Rey Rivera (32), American writer who was working for Stansberry and Associates who went missing from his house on 16 May 2006 and was found dead on Belvedere Hotel on 24 May 2006, in Mount Vernon, Baltimore Even though the Baltimore Police Department has claimed that his death was most likely to be a suicide, this has not been proven to be the case. *Bob Woolmer (58), Pakistan's national cricket coach, was found dead in his hotel room on 18 March 2007, after losing in the Cricket World Cup 2007 in the West Indies. Investigators at first ruled the death a suicide, but the jury that heard the inquest returned an open verdict. *Three years after the body of Corryn Rayney (44), was found in the Perth suburb of Kings Park, Western Australia a week after her 7 August 2007 disappearance, her husband Lloyd was charged in her murder even though a cause of death had not been determined. A judge acquitted him at his 2012 trial, finding the largely circumstantial case was further compromised by police misconduct. The verdict was upheld on appeal the following year; Rayney and his lawyers have called for two known sex criminals to be investigated as well. *Two-year-old Caylee Anthony, of Orlando, Florida, was reported missing by her grandmother in the summer of 2008, when she learned that her daughter Casey had not seen her in over a month. Casey claimed the girl had been kidnapped by a nanny and circumstantial evidence led to her arrest on murder charges that fall. A tip that could have led to the body's discovery in August was not fully acted upon until December; by then the body was so decomposed that it was impossible to establish how Caylee had died, although the coroner ruled it homicide. Casey Anthony, despite public sentiment strongly against her, was acquitted of the murder and child-abuse charges (but convicted of the lesser charges of lying to the police) after a heavily covered trial in 2011, where her lawyer claimed that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family pool and Casey's domineering father had led a cover-up. Later, her father came forward with his own explanation: Casey had allegedly been known to drug Caylee to entice her to sleep so Casey could leave Caylee home alone and go out with friends for the evening. He alleges Casey or a friend accidentally overdosed Caylee, killing her, and in a panic, made up the kidnapping story as a cover. *American guitarist Hiram Bullock (52), died on 25 July 2008 of an undetermined cause. While it was known that he had tongue cancer and was still in treatment, he was believed to have completely recovered from the disease, which is why some sources dispute cancer as the cause of death and suggest that he died as a result of his drug addiction problems. *American professional wrestler Steven James Bisson (32), who went by the ring name of \\"Steve Bradley\\" was found dead on 4 December 2008 in Manchester, New Hampshire in a parking lot across the street from a pro wrestling school in where he once operated. Bradley's cause of death is undetermined, as the autopsy could not reveal what he died from, so his death remains a mystery. *The Peter Bergmann case is an unsolved mystery pertaining to the death of an unidentified man in County Sligo, Ireland, whose naked body was found on a beach. From 12 to 16 June 2009, a man using the alias \\"Peter Bergmann\\" visited the coastal seaport town of Sligo in northwest Ireland. He used this alias to check into the Sligo City Hotel, where he stayed during the majority of his visit, and was described by hotel staff and tenants as having a heavy German accent. Despite conducting a five-month investigation into the death of \\"Peter Bergmann\\", an Garda S√≠och√°na have never been able to identify the man or develop any leads in the case. * Skeletal remains found in a dry creek bed in California's Malibu Canyon on 9 August 2010, turned out to be those of Mitrice Richardson (25). She had last been seen on the night of 16 September 2009 in the backyard of a former local television news anchor, after being arrested for marijuana possession and failure to pay the bill at a local restaurant where she had been acting strangely, behavior that investigating officers did not believe was caused by alcohol or drugs. The coroner has said her death did not appear to be a homicide, but the body was too decayed to determine the exact cause of death. =2010‚Äì2019= * On 23 August 2010, the partially decomposed body of Gareth Williams (32), a Welsh mathematician who worked for British intelligence GCHQ, but who was seconded to MI6 at the time of his death, was found in a padlocked bag in the bathroom of a safe house in the London neighbourhood of Pimlico. It was determined he had been dead for about a week. Due to the nature of his work, the investigation had to withhold details of it and some other aspects from any material made public; his family and friends allege that the Metropolitan Police compromised and mishandled key forensic evidence in the early stages of their response. An initial investigation by the coroner's office concluded that the death was a homicide; a later re-investigation by the police claimed that it was instead an accident. *Rajiv Dixit (43), an Indian public speaker and social activist who died on 30 November 2010 in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, after his meal was poisoned. It is claimed that Dixit refused to undergo emergency medical treatment, as he did not trust Allopathic medicine, and died shortly thereafter. No autopsy was ever conducted so it remains known whether Dixit was deliberately poisoned, committed suicide, or if a person or persons covered up the truth. * British citizen Lee Bradley Brown (39), was arrested by Dubai police while on holiday there 6 April 2011 and charged with assault after an incident between him and a hotel maid; accounts of the circumstances differ. Held without bail, he died in custody six days later after, police claimed, being beaten by cellmates; later they said he had \\"thrown himself on the ground repeatedly.\\" An autopsy, however, found instead that Brown had, under the influence of hashish, choked on his own vomit. British officials who were allowed to examine the body disputed that conclusion, saying they saw no evidence of choking or blunt force trauma; Dubai authorities have declined repeated requests to share evidence such as CCTV footage from the original incident and the police station that might clarify matters. A coroner's inquest in the UK that considered only the autopsy report and the diplomats' reports returned an open verdict. *Tom J. Anderson (35), formerly known by his birth name \\"Ahmad Rezaee\\" was a businessman and the eldest son of Iranian Major General Mohsen Rezaee. On 12 November 2011, he was found dead in the Gloria Hotel, located in Dubai Media City where he was staying. There are different theories about how he died, yet the cause of his death remains unknown. *Elisa Lam, a student at the University of British Columbia, was found deceased on 19 February 2013, in a water tank atop the Hotel Cecil in Downtown Los Angeles. She is believed to have died on February 1st. Her death was attributed to drowning, but the details surrounding how she ended up in the water tank are unclear. The hotel's surveillance video shows Lam entering and exiting an elevator and behaving erratically, hours before the time she is believed to have died. * Exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky (67), was found dead in his home near Ascot, Berkshire on 23 March 2013. At first glance he had hanged himself; he had recently lost what remained of his fortune, and some other close friends had unexpectedly died, which had left him despondent. The police soon ruled the case a suicide, but at the inquest, Berezovsky's daughter, who believes her father was murdered at the behest of the Russian government, introduced a report by a German pathologist that cast enough doubt for the coroner to return an open verdict. * On 15‚Äì16 November 2013, skeletal remains of two adults and child were found in a field outside Red Oak, Oklahoma. A year later they were identified as the Jamison family, who had gone missing in 2009 while looking into some land they wanted to purchase. Their abandoned pickup truck was three miles (4.8 km) from where their bodies were found. No cause of death has been determined. * The decomposing remains of Canadian journalist Dave Walker (57), were found in Cambodia's Angkor temple complex on 1 May 2014,CBC News: Canadian filmmaker Dave Walker found dead in Cambodia (accessed 30 January 2016) ending a search that began shortly after he failed to return to his hotel's guest house on the night of 14 February. While the medical examiner concluded that he had died weeks earlier, the cause of Walker's death could not be determined. * Bone fragments found along the Rio Culebra near Boquete, Panama, in late June 2014 were matched to Lisanne Froon, 21, and Kristin Kremers, 22, of Amersfoort, the Netherlands. The two had last been seen alive on 1 April when they went for a hike on the popular Pianista trail. The women's cell phones, recovered along with their remains, showed that they had repeatedly attempted to contact emergency numbers shortly after taking pictures of themselves at the Continental Divide. Those calls had continued over several days, and the phones also contained almost a hundred photographs taken during the next 10 days, most of which were completely dark but some of which showed plants and rock formations in close-up. It was impossible to determine from the remains that were found exactly how they had died. Local officials believe the girls suffered an accidental injury shortly after getting lost in a network of trails in the region's cloud forests and got lost in the wilderness around Volc√°n Bar√∫; however, Panamanian lawyers for their families have pointed to failings of the investigation and suggested both women could have met with foul play. * On 27 June 2014, the body of Andrew Sadek (20), was recovered from the Red River near Breckenridge, Minnesota, with a small-caliber gunshot wound and a backpack full of rocks. He had last been seen by a security camera leaving his dorm at North Dakota State College of Science in Wahpeton around 2 a.m. on 1 May. At the time of his disappearance he had been working as a confidential informant for local police as a result of his own arrest for selling marijuana on campus, which could otherwise have resulted in a long prison sentence. It has not been determined yet whether his death was suicide or murder. Like Rachel Hoffman's death, the case has been used as an example of the mishandling of youthful CIs by police. *Gennadiy Tsypkalov (43), was a political and military figure of the unrecognized Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). According to officials of the Luhansk People's Republic, Tsypkalov had committed suicide on 17 May 2014,Ex- premier of LPR Tsypkalov has committed suicide (–≠–∫—Å-–ø—Ä–µ–º—å–µ—Ä –õ–ù–† –¶—ã–ø–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–∏–ª —Å–∞–º–æ—É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ) .

The bodies were in an upstairs bedroom where a fire had been set; they were found with multiple stab wounds. An original ruling of murder-suicide was changed to undetermined in 2017 after a court challenge by the couple's sons, motivated by complaints of mishandled evidence and some evidence suggesting the couple had been attacked by an intruder. The sons are currently calling for the investigation to be reopened. *On 31 January 2015 a deceased homeless man who have been given the name of Jesse Doe (80), was found under an overpass in San Diego, California was said to have been identified as being Elvis Presley. This was later proven to be a hoax, and the man's true identity is unknown. * Alberto Nisman (51), an Argentine federal prosecutor, was found dead in his apartment of a single gunshot wound to the head on 18 January 2015. He had been investigating the 1994 AMIA bombing, Argentina's deadliest terror attack, and had publicly accused President Cristina Kirchner and other high officials close to her of covering up for suspects in the case for foreign-policy reasons; he was scheduled to present these allegations to Congress the next day. While some of the circumstances of his death are consistent with an early statement that he committed suicide, friends and relatives say that he was eagerly looking ahead to his appearance before Congress and did not seem depressed or despondent at all. Kirchner has suggested the country's intelligence services were behind the killing, since he was about to expose their attempts to bring her down, and called for them to be dismantled. The case remains under investigation. *Kayla Mueller (26), an American human rights activist and humanitarian aid worker who had been taken captive by the Islamic State in August 2013 in Aleppo, Syria, where she was helping Doctors Without Borders, was reported to have died in a Jordanian air strike during the Syrian Civil War in Raqqa on 6 February 2015. Her death was confirmed by the Pentagon, but the circumstances could not be established by the US. The Pentagon agreed the building she supposedly died in according to ISIS was hit in the bombings, but disputed that Mueller or any other civilian had been inside at the time. The site had been bombed by the coalition twice before, and was targeted again because ISIS soldiers sometimes return to bombed sites, thinking the coalition would not bomb those sites again, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. After Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi's death in October 2019, new speculations arose that Al-Baghdadi may have had her executed. * On 22 April 2015, the body of Ambrose Ball (30), of London, was recovered from the River Lea in Tottenham. He had last been seen leaving his vehicle following a single-car accident early on the morning of 24 January after visiting a local pub with friends. The body was too decomposed to determine a cause of death; police requested an adjournment of the inquest in order to further investigate, implying a murder charge was in the works. No charges were ever filed, and threats were later made against Ball's friends and family after they set up a Facebook page appealing for help from the public and questioning the conduct of the investigation. * On 10 December 2016, human remains were discovered in Charlestown, Rhode Island that were thought to be those of mobster Danny Walsh (43). The remains were found where he once had lived. This was later proved false, and the person to whom they belonged to and identity and death cause are unknown. Valery Bolotov. Leader of the Luhansk People's Republic. His body was discovered on 27 January 2017 * Valery Bolotov (46), was a Ukrainian militant leader known for his involvement in the Donbass War in eastern Ukraine, and as the leader of the unrecognized Luhansk People's Republic. Bolotov was found dead on 27 January 2017 in his own home in Moscow, Russia. The preliminary results of clinical tests showed an acute heart failure as reason of death. Poisoning later was suspected.

His cause of death is thought to be a murder, but this remains uncertain due to a lack of evidence, and a four-month investigation was conducted by the FBI into his death cause, but the results were inconclusive. * Computer hacker Adrian Lamo (37), was found dead 14 March 2018 on a pile of sheets in the guest bedroom of the Wichita, Kansas, home of a couple he had been living with. After three months of investigating, the county coroner was unable to identify a cause of death. While there are some alternative theories suggesting his death had something to do with his controversial involvement in the criminal cases against Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange, the most likely theory is the possible adverse interactions of some of the medicines found near him with Kratom, which he often used. *In June 2019, the Police discovered burnt human remains in McComb, Mississippi that might have belonged to Donald Izzett (44), who disappeared in May 1995, yet this has not yet been proven to be true. * Billionaire and convicted sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein (66), was found dead in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City in August 2019. His death was ruled a likely suicide by the New York City Chief Medical Examiner, although reported questions of it being a homicide committed by an unknown assailant. His death is still currently under investigation by multiple groups.https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/jeffrey-epstein-death-mayor- de-blasio *Tylee Ryan and J. J. Vallow (16 and 7, respectively), were American siblings from Rexburg, Idaho, who disappeared in September 2019. After relatives did not hear from the children in weeks and several suspicious events in the preceding months, a welfare check was performed. The children's mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, refused to cooperate with police after abandoning Idaho and moving to Hawaii in January 2020 with her new husband Chad Daybell. Vallow was arrested for failing to support her minor children in March. Later, Chad Daybell was arrested for tampering with evidence after the children's bodies were discovered buried in his Rexburg property. The cause of the children's death and the circumstances surrounding it are currently under investigation; their mother and stepfather have not directly been charged for their deaths but the investigation is ongoing. =2020s= *Ana Lucrecia Taglioretti (24), was a blind female Paraguayan actress and prodigy who had performed at events for charitable causes. She was found dead on 9 January 2020 in her apartment by her mother during a welfare check. Her cause of death is currently unknown. Date of death disputed * Raoul Wallenberg (34), a Swedish humanitarian who worked in Budapest, Hungary, was most likely executed in the Soviet Union in or around 1947 after being captured by the Red Army in 1945. His death is dated by Soviet authorities as 16 July 1947, but this is disputed, and the case remains unsolved. * In 1948, a German court ruled that Hans Kammler (43), an engineer and SS commander who oversaw many Nazi construction projects including concentration camps and, later, the V-2 missile program, died on 9 May 1945 of what was later claimed to be suicide by cyanide poisoning.Karlsch, Rainer (2014). \\"Was wurde aus Hans Kammler?

Biography Davies was born in Utica, New York,Biographical information for this entry is taken from Bennard B. Perlman and Brooks Wright. the son of David and Phoebe Davies.1870 United States Federal Census He was keenly interested in drawing when he was young and, at fifteen, attended a large touring exhibition in his hometown of American landscape art, featuring works by George Inness and members of the Hudson River School. The show had a profound effect on him. He was especially impressed by Inness's tonalist landscapes.Perlman, p. 7. After his family relocated to Chicago, Davies studied at the Chicago Academy of Design from 1879 to 1882 and briefly attended the Art Institute of Chicago, before moving to New York City, where he studied at the Art Students League. He worked as a magazine illustrator before devoting himself to painting. In 1892, Davies married Virginia Meriwether, one of New York State's first female physicians. Her family, suspecting that their daughter might end by being the sole breadwinner of the family if she was to marry an impoverished artist, insisted that the bridegroom sign a prenuptial agreement, renouncing any claim on his wife's money in the event of divorce. (Davies would eventually become very wealthy through the sale of his paintings, though his prospects at thirty did not look encouraging.) Appearances notwithstanding, they were anything but a conventional couple, even aside from the fact that Davies was of a philandering nature. Virginia had eloped when she was young and had murdered her husband on her honeymoon when she discovered that he was an abusive drug addict and compulsive gambler, a fact that she and her family kept from Davies.Perlman, p. 45. When Davies died in 1928, Virginia discovered that he had kept hidden a second life, with another common-law wife, Edna, and family. Edna discovered that she was given a subsistence allowance by Arthur, despite his financial success as an artist.Perlman, p. 45. An urbane man with a formal demeanor, Arthur B. Davies was \\"famously diffident and retiring\\".Kimberly Orcutt, \\"The Problem of Arthur B. Davies\\" in Elizabeth Kennedy (ed.), The Eight and American Modernisms, p. 23. He would rarely invite anyone to his studio and, later in life, would go out of his way to avoid old friends and acquaintances.\\"The Death of Arthur B. Davies\\" in Daniel Catton Rich (ed.), The Flow of Art: Essays and Criticisms of Henry McBride (New York: Atheneum, 1975), pp. 247-249. The reason for Davies' reticence became known after his sudden death while vacationing in Italy in 1928: he had two wives (one legal, one common-law) and children by each of them, a secret kept from Virginia for twenty-five years. With Virginia, he had two sons, Niles and Arthur. 1910 United States Federal Census Career Arthur B. Davies, Dancing Children, 1902. Brooklyn Museum Arthur B. Davies, The Dawning, 1915. Brooklyn Museum Within a year of his marriage, Davies' paintings began to sell, slowly but steadily.Wright, p. 26. In turn-of-the-century America, he found a market for his gentle, expertly painted evocations of a fantasy world. Regular trips to Europe, where he immersed himself in Dutch art and came to love the work of Corot and Millet, helped him to hone his color sense and refine his brushwork. By the time he was in his forties, Davies had definitively proved his in-laws wrong and, represented by a prestigious Manhattan art dealer, William Macbeth, was making a comfortable living. His reputation at the time, and still today (to the extent that he is known at all), rests on his ethereal figure paintings, the most famous of which is Unicorns: Legend, Sea Calm (1906) in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the 1920s, his works commanded very high prices and he was recognized as one of the most respected and financially successful American painters. He was prolific, consistent, and highly skilled. Art history texts routinely cited him as one of America's greatest artists. Important collectors like Duncan Phillips were eager to buy his latest drawings, watercolors, and oil paintings. Freshness of the Wounded, ca. 1917. Brooklyn Museum Davies was also the principal organizer of the legendary 1913 Armory Show and a member of The Eight, a group of painters who in 1908 mounted a protest against the restrictive exhibition practices of the powerful, conservative National Academy of Design. Five members of the Eight‚ÄîRobert Henri (1865‚Äì1929), George Luks (1867‚Äì1933), William Glackens, (1870‚Äì1938), John Sloan, (1871‚Äì1951), and Everett Shinn (1876‚Äì1953)‚Äîwere Ashcan realists, while Davies, Maurice Prendergast (1859‚Äì1924), and Ernest Lawson (1873‚Äì1939) painted in a different, less realistic style. His friend Alfred Stieglitz, patron to many modern artists, regarded Davies as more broadly knowledgeable about contemporary art than anyone he knew.Sue Davidson Lowe, Stieglitz: A Memoir/Biography (New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1983), p. 163. Davies also served as an advisor to many wealthy New Yorkers who wanted guidance about making purchases for their art collections. Two of those collectors were Lizzie P. Bliss and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, two of the founders of the Museum of Modern Art, whose Davies-guided collections eventually became a core part of that museum.Wright, pp. 86-87. Wright notes: \\"Miss Bliss was more than a patron; she was a confidante, and one of the few people with whom he could be himself. Despite the disapproval of her family, who felt that such conduct was indiscreet in a spinster past forty, she would visit him in his studio, play the piano [with him], talk about music and listen to his ideas about art.\\" Davies was quietly but remarkably generous in his support of fellow artists. He was a mentor to the gifted but deeply troubled sculptor John Flannagan, whom he rescued from dire poverty and near- starvation.Perlman, p. 314. He helped finance Marsden Hartley's 1912 trip to Europe, which resulted in a major phase of Hartley's career. He recommended to his own dealer financially strapped artists whose talent he believed in, like Rockwell Kent.Kimberly Orcutt, \\"The Problem of Arthur B. Davies\\" in Elizabeth Kennedy (ed.), The Eight and American Modernisms, p. 27. Yet Davies made enemies as well. His role in organizing the Armory Show, a massive display of modern art which proved somewhat threatening to American realists like Robert Henri, the leader of The Eight, showed a forceful side to his character that many in the art world had never seen. With fellow artists Walt Kuhn and Walter Pach, he devoted himself with great zeal to the project of scouring Europe for the best examples of Cubism, Fauvism, and Futurism and publicizing the exhibition in New York and later in Chicago and Boston. Those who did not fully support the venture or expressed any reservations, like his old colleague Henri, were treated with contempt. Davies knew in which direction the tide of art history was flowing and displayed little tolerance for those who could not keep pace.Perlman, p. 222. In an official statement for a pamphlet that was sold at the Chicago venue of the Armory Show and later reprinted in The Outlook magazine, Davies wrote: \\"In getting together the works of the European Moderns, the Society [i.e., the organizing body for the Armory Show, the Association of American Painters and Sculptors] has embarked on no propaganda. It proposes to enter on no controversy with any institution ... Of course, controversies will arise, but they will not be the result of any stand taken by the Association as such.\\"For & Against: Views on the Infamous 1913 Armory Show, Tucson: HolArt Books, 2009, pp. 1-2. With these masterfully disingenuous words, Davies pretended that the men who had brought some of the most radical contemporary art to the United States were merely offering Americans an opportunity for a dispassionate viewing experience. In reality, Davies, Kuhn, and Pach knew that their bold project was likely to alter, decisively and permanently, the cultural landscape of America. Style Arthur B. Davies is an anomaly in American art history, an artist whose own lyrical work could be described as restrained and conservative but whose tastes were as advanced and open to experimentation as those of anyone of his time. (His personal art collection at the time of his death included works by Alfred Maurer, Marsden Hartley, and Joseph Stella as well as major European modernists like C√©zanne and Br√¢ncu»ôi.Orcutt, p. 27.) As art historian Milton Brown wrote of Davies' early period, \\"A product of the Tonalist school and Whistler, he had developed a unique decorative style. He was completely eclectic,\\" with influences that ranged from Hellenistic Greek art to Sandro Botticelli, the German painter Arnold B√∂cklin, and the English Pre- Raphaelites.Brown, p. 61. A painter of dream-like maidens and \\"frieze-like idylls,\\"Hughes, p. 354. he was most often compared to the French artist Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. His involvement with the Armory Show and prolonged exposure to European Modernism, however, changed his outlook utterly. As art historian Sam Hunter wrote, \\"[One] could scarcely have guessed that the bold colors of Matisse and the radical simplifications of the Cubists would engage Davies' sympathies,\\" but so they did.Hunter, p. 64. His subsequent work attempted to merge stronger color and a Cubist sense of structure and Cubist forms with his on-going preoccupation with the female body, delicate movement, and an essentially romantic outlook (e.g., Day of Good Fortune, in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art.) \\"Mr. Davies takes his Cubism lightly,\\" a sympathetic critic wrote in 1913,Rich, p. 40. acknowledging a view, held then and now, that Davies' Cubist-inspired paintings have an elegant appeal but are not in the more rigorous or authentic spirit of Cubism as practiced by Picasso, Georges Braque, and Juan Gris. By 1918, Davies returned, in large part, to his earlier style. Kimberly Orcutt plausibly speculates that Davies found the mixed reactions (and sometimes very negative responses) to his more modernist explorations distressing and so \\"returned to the style that was expected of him, the one that had brought him praise and prosperity.\\"Orcutt, p. 30.

It is the largest parish on Saint Kitts and the second largest parish in Saint Kitts and Nevis (after Saint James Windward). It is by far the most populous parish in the federation, holding nearly a third of the country's population. It is home to the city of Basseterre, capital of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and also has a longer coastline than any other parish in Saint Kitts and Nevis. Land The parish's offer the most diverse terrain to be found in a single parish in the country. The northern part of Saint George Basseterre comprises the large Basseterre Valley, one of the most fertile spots on the island. The expansive flatlands are intensively used for agriculture, with the city of Basseterre skirting the coast. The central and southern portions of the parish constitute Saint Kitts' South East Peninsula, and has a strikingly contrasting arid climate. It is made up of eroded hills, scrub vegetation, salt ponds and white sand beaches. The largest pond, the Great Salt Pond, covers . A mile offshore, in the centre of the channel separating Saint Kitts and Nevis lies Booby Island, a rocky island not officially claimed by Saint George Basseterre nor Saint James Windward. Cities and towns The capital city of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Basseterre, is located on the coast of Basseterre Bay, but the city also stretches northward into the parish of Saint Peter Basseterre. The location is ideal, as it is the congregation of the island's 4 main thoroughfares (West to Sandy Point, East to Cayon, North to Monkey Hill, and South to the South East Peninsula). The parish's other settlements act as suburbs to the city. Some of the suburbs are Frigate Bay, Mattingley, Bird Rock, Harbour View and New Road. The rich agricultural lands surrounding Basseterre are heavily cultivated, mainly with fruits and vegetables for local consumption as well as for sale to cruise ships and hotels. Being home to all of St. Kitts' white sand beaches, the South East Peninsula in Saint George Basseterre is the centre for the island's tourism industry. At present, nearly all the tourism development is at the resort town of Frigate Bay, ideally located on a narrow isthmus with 2 fine beaches (one on the Caribbean side and one on the Atlantic side) within 5 minutes walking distance of one another. It is also home to Saint Kitts' championship golf course. Capital ‚Äì Basseterre Other Villages: *Bird Rock *Frigate Bay Economy Saint George Basseterre is the economic heart of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and is of significant importance to the greater Eastern Caribbean area. Most Kittitians and also many Nevisians work in the city. Basseterre is a regional financial centre, home to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Headquarters, as well as the Eastern Caribbean Stock Exchange. It is also home to the Eastern Caribbean's largest light manufacturing industry. The many hotels and resorts in Frigate Bay also are responsible for a lot of the islands' employment and foreign exchange earnings. The parish's former main employer, the sugar factory, officially closed in 2005 following dropping world prices. Ports Saint George Basseterre is home to Saint Kitts' 2 seaports of entry, Port Zante and Deep Water Harbour. Community festivals Saint George Basseterre is home to three community festivals, Newtown Fest, Gut O'Rama and Village O'Rama. Newtown Fest is held in East Basseterre, mainly centered on the Newtown community, one of the oldest settled wards in the city of Basseterre. Held in mid-September, it features calypso shows, beauty pageants, jam sessions and late night liming sessions. Gut O'Rama is an annual festival held in Central Basseterre, with most activities located in the Westbourne Ghaut area (thus the name). The other community festival in Basseterre is the oldest running and largest (by participant population) community festival in St. Kitts, Village O' Rama. Held in early December, it has the usual festival celebrations (calypso, pageants and jamming), held in 'De Village,' the name given to the collective Western Basseterre communities (because the ward resulted from the overgrowth and amalgamation of several small, separate villages once in the area). Future developments The bulk of the Eastern section of the Basseterre Valley (about 2 square miles) is to be developed into a large national park, in attempt to protect the aquifer system beneath it. Future tourism developments are centred on the Great Salt Pond area in the south. Villa developments are also in the works on various hills and ridges on the peninsula, as well as a dolphin park on South Friar's Bay. The city of Basseterre was also a venue for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.

It also encloses the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. Location and infrastructure Loading munitions from the wharfNWS Seal Beach occupies 5,256 acres (8.2 square miles (21 km¬≤)), has 230 buildings and 128 ammunition depots providing 589,299 feet¬≤ (54,747 m¬≤) of ammunition storage space. Ammunition was moved from storage to the docks on 56 miles (90 km) of railroad line which closed in 2008 and the tracks were taken out in 2010, after which 80 miles (128 km) of road are used instead. The base owned 130 pieces of railroad rolling stock which were dismantled, their function being taken up by 230 trucks and trailers to move the ammunition, which is loaded onto ships using six mobile cranes that can lift up to 90 tons (81 tonnes). The station is bounded on the north by the combined Interstate 405 and State Route 22; on the west by Seal Beach Boulevard; on the south west by the Pacific Ocean; on the south east by the Bolsa Chica Channel and Edinger Avenue; and on the east by the Bolsa Chica Channel and Bolsa Chica Road. From Edinger Avenue to Interstate 405, a distance of about three miles, all roads to the east of the station terminate at Bolsa Chica Road, with the exception of Westminster Boulevard, which runs through the center of the facility, separated by a chain-link fence on both sides. Edinger Avenue enters the facility, but public access terminates at an emergency gate. On the west side of the station south of Interstate 405, Westminster Boulevard and the Pacific Coast Highway are the only public roads running through any part of the station. Memorial World War II Submarine MemorialThe Weapons Station is also home to the World War II National Submarine Memorial - West. The Memorial is dedicated to the over 3000 submariners who lost their lives in United States submarines in the 52 submarines lost during World War II. There are also plaques dedicated to those who lost their lives in submarine accidents during the Cold War. The Memorial is located outside the main entrance to the Weapons Station on Seal Beach Boulevard and is accessible to the public. Environment The Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge is a 920 acre (4 km¬≤) salt marsh located within the boundaries of the Weapons Station. Marsh wetlands of the Wildlife Refuge. An Installation Restoration (IR) project is underway at the base to clean up environmental hazards and restore damaged areas. Working with a Restoration Advisory Board made up of representatives from the surrounding community, a total of 73 sites needing attention were identified. Studies of the recommended sites were done and 46 were found to have no contamination and required no intervention. Five facilities were permitted and are still in use and were removed from the IR program. Responsibility for two underground tanks was transferred to other agencies with expertise in such tanks. Seven sites have had the cleanup process completed with 13 other sites in the process of analysis or cleanup as of September 2005. The remaining 13 sites range from the station landfill to a paint locker to an explosives burning ground.

It is the second largest parish on Saint Kitts (after Saint George Basseterre Parish), and the third largest parish in the federation (the largest being Saint James Windward Parish). The capital of the parish is Dieppe Bay Town. Land The parish's 5 mile coastline is one of the most impressive and varied in the federation. The northern coasts consist of long beaches with black volcanic sand. Large offshore reef formations almost completely surround Dieppe Bay Beach, creating the island's safest natural harbour. The other beaches, namely Parson's Beach and Sandy Bay, however, lack this protection and are battered by the turbulent waves of the Atlantic Ocean. The southern coasts contain one of the island's most noted natural features, Black Rocks. Stretching for almost 2 miles, these large metamorphic rock projections are the result of St. Kitts' last volcanic eruption (estimated to be in the 14th century) when lava poured down the slopes of Mount Liamuiga creeping until it met the Atlantic Ocean, where it cooled and hardened. Shaped and formed by wave action over the years, the many grottoes, pools and projections that now line the area are a testament to the island's volcanicity. Saint John Capisterre is also home to the tallest peak in the Leeward Islands, Mount Liamuiga, whose crater lake marks the boundary for Saint Paul Capisterre, Saint Anne Sandy Point and Saint Thomas Middle Island. The parish's interior is completely dominated by Liamuiga and other peaks of the North West and Central Ranges, covered with tropical forests. Below 1000 feet, the forests give way to small farm holdings and abandoned sugar cane estates. The parish is a main producer for tropical fruit on the island. Towns and villages The largest town in the parish is Saddler's, with a population of almost 2,000. The village of Tabernacle is the second largest settlement. Another main settlement in the parish is the town of Dieppe, the first French settlement on the island, and parish capital (although Saddler's functions as a second parish capital). Other settlements include Parson's Ground Village, Pogson Village, Lynch's Village, Harris' Village and Belle Vue. Due to the rough Atlantic coastline, only the reef-protected towns of Dieppe Bay and Parson's hug the coast. All other settlements are further inland. Tabernacle is further recognized locally, being founded by newly emancipated slaves in the late 19th century. Capitals * Dieppe Bay, * Saddlers (largest village) Other Villages: * Parson's * Harris' * Belle Vue * Tabernacle Economy The main employer in the parish is agriculture. The fertile slopes of Mount Liamuiga are home to many small farms and a wide variety of tropical fruits are grown for local consumption, mainly acerola, avocado, banana, breadfruit, carambola, cashew, mango, papaya, sugar apple, and golden apple. Tourism is also a key industry here. The Golden Lemon Hotel, one of the island's most exclusive and expensive, situated on Dieppe Bay Beach, is a large employer of the population. The rich reefs of Dieppe are a major local fishing ground, and are also a popular snorkeling area. The rougher Sandy Bay has grown into a local surfing spot, and for those even more adventurous, climbing down the cliffs of Black Rocks to bathe in the elusive pools provides a challenge. The most recent addition to the parish is the Beaumont Park Race Track, hailed as one of the finest in the region, near the town of Dieppe Bay. The Race track offers horse and greyhound racing, as well as facilities for state-of-the-art gambling. Port In the 17th century, the port of Dieppe Bay Town, the island's most protected harbour, was a hub of activity, and served the former French region of Capisterre, from which the parish derives part of its name. After full British control in 1713, however, its functions as an international port ceased. Today, the harbour is used as a base for the local coast guard, for docking small fishing vessels, and also as a dock for small vessels in turbulent weather. Community festivals Saint John Capisterre is home to three community festivals, more than any other parish (except Saint George Basseterre which has the same number). They are la festival de Capisterre, Saddlefest, and Festab. Festival de Capisterre is held in Northern St. Kitts, a region formerly held by France (17th century) which was named Capesterre (land facing the wind, as opposed to Basseterre, meaning land sheltered from the wind). The four villages of the region (Newton Ground and Saint Paul Capisterre in Saint Paul Capisterre and Dieppe and Parson's in Saint John Capisterre) thus annually hold the festival in mid-September to celebrate the distinction. Saddlefest is a community festival held in the large village of Saddlers. It features calypso shows, beauty pageants, late night liming and street jam sessions. Festab is the final festival, with many similar activities to Saddlefest, but held in the village of Tabernacle, and with its own unique styles and charms. Future Beaumont Heights villas, surrounding the Beaumont Park area, is currently being developed as a high-end housing area. The Saddle Hill Adventure Park, which broke ground in January 2013, is also expected to further improve the parish as an area of fun and activity for tourists and locals alike.

The most sweeping immigration act the United States had passed until that time, it followed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in marking a turn toward nativism. The 1917 act governed immigration policy until it was amended by the Immigration Act of 1924; both acts were revised by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Background Various groups, including the Immigration Restriction League had supported literacy as a prerequisite for immigration from its formation in 1894. In 1895, Henry Cabot Lodge had introduced a bill to the United States Senate to impose a mandate for literacy for immigrants, using a test requiring them to read five lines from the Constitution. Though the bill passed, it was vetoed by President Grover Cleveland in 1897. In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt lent support for the idea in his first address but the resulting proposal was defeated in 1903. A literacy test was included in a US Senate immigration bill of 1906, but the House of Representatives did not agree to this, and the test was dropped in the conference committee finalizing what became the Immigration Act of 1907. Literacy was introduced again in 1912 and though it passed, it was vetoed by President William Howard Taft. By 1915, yet another bill with a literacy requirement was passed. It was vetoed by President Woodrow Wilson because he felt that literacy tests denied equal opportunity to those who had not been educated. As early as 1882, previous immigration acts had levied head taxes on aliens entering the country to offset the cost of their care if they became indigent. These acts excluded immigrants from Canada or Mexico, as did subsequent amendments to the amount of the head tax. The Immigration Act of 1882 prohibited entry to the U.S. for convicts, indigent people who could not provide for their own care, prostitutes, and lunatics or idiots. The Alien Contract Labor Law of 1885 prohibited employers from contracting with foreign laborers and bringing them into the U.S., though U.S. employers continued to recruit Mexican contract laborers assuming they would just return home. After the assassination of President William McKinley by the anarchist Leon Czolgosz on September 6, 1901, several immigration Acts were passed which broadened the defined categories of \\"undesireables.\\" The Immigration Act of 1903 expanded barred categories to include anarchists, epileptics and those who had had episodes of insanity. Those who had infectious diseases and those who had physical or mental disabilities which would hamper their ability to work were added to the list of excluded immigrants in the Immigration Act of 1907. Anxiety over the fragmentation of American cultural identity led to many laws aimed at stemming the \\"Yellow Peril,\\" the perceived threat of Asian societies replacing the American identity. Laws restricting Asian immigration to the United States had first appeared in California as state laws. With the enactment of the Naturalization Act of 1870, which denied citizenship to Chinese immigrants and forbade all Chinese women, exclusionary policies moved into the federal sphere. Exclusion of women aimed to cement a bachelor society, making Chinese men unable to form families and thus, transient, temporary immigrants. Barred categories expanded with the Page Act of 1875, which established that Chinese, Japanese and Oriental bonded labor, convicts, and prostitutes were forbidden entry to the U.S. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 barred Chinese people from entering the U.S. and the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 was made with Japan to cease Japanese immigration to the US. Provisions On February 5, 1917, the Immigration Act of 1917 was passed by the 64th United States Congress with an overwhelming majority, overriding President Woodrow Wilson's December 14, 1916, veto. This act added to and consolidated the list of undesirables banned from entering the country, including: alcoholics, anarchists, contract laborers, criminals, convicts, epileptics, \\"feebleminded persons,\\" \\"idiots,\\" \\"illiterates,\\" \\"imbeciles,\\" \\"insane persons,\\" \\"paupers,\\" \\"persons afflicted with contagious disease,\\" \\"persons being mentally or physically defective,\\" \\"persons with constitutional psychopathic inferiority,\\" \\"political radicals,\\" polygamists, prostitutes, and vagrants. Map showing Asiatic zone prescribed in section three of Immigration Act, the natives of which are excluded from the United State, with certain exceptions. To contain the so-called \\"Yellow Peril,\\" the Immigration Act of 1917 established the \\"Asiatic barred zone\\" (shown in green), from which the U.S. admitted no immigrants. For the first time, an immigration law of the U.S. affected European immigration, with the provision barring all immigrants over the age of sixteen who were illiterate. Literacy was defined as the ability to read 30‚Äì40 words of their own language from an ordinary text. The act reaffirmed the ban on contracted labor, but made a provision for temporary labor. This allowed laborers to obtain temporary permits because they were inadmissible as immigrants. The waiver program allowed continued recruitment of Mexican agricultural and railroad workers. Legal interpretation on the terms \\"mentally defective\\" and \\"persons with constitutional psychopathic inferiority\\" effectively included a ban on homosexual immigrants who admitted their sexual orientation. One section of the law designated an \\"Asiatic barred zone\\" from which people could not immigrate, including much of Asia and the Pacific Islands. The zone, defined through longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates, excluded immigrants from China, British India, Afghanistan, Arabia, Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), the Malay States, the Dutch East Indies, the Soviet Union east of the Ural Mountains, and most Polynesian islands.Airriess, Christopher A.; Contemporary Ethnic Geographies in America, p. 39. Neither Japan nor the Philippines were included in the banned zone. The description of the zone is as follows: > ...unless otherwise provided for by existing treaties, persons who are > natives of islands not possessed by the United States adjacent to the > continent of Asia, situated south of the twentieth parallel latitude north, > west of the one hundred and sixtieth meridian of longitude east from > Greenwich, and north of the tenth parallel of latitude south, or who are > natives of any country, province, or dependency situated on the continent of > Asia west of the one hundred and tenth meridian of longitude east from > Greenwich and east of the fiftieth meridian of longitude east from Greenwich > and south of the fiftieth parallel of latitude north, except that portion of > said territory situate between the fiftieth and the sixth-fourth meridians > of longitude east from Greenwich and the twenty-fourth and thirty-eight > parallels of latitude north, and no alien now in any way excluded from, or > prevented from entering, the United States shall be admitted to the United > States. The 1917 Asian exclusions did not apply to those working in certain professional occupations and their immediate families: \\"(1) Government officers, (2) ministers or religious teachers, (3) missionaries, (4) lawyers, (5) physicians, (6) chemists, (7) civil engineers, (8) teachers, (9) students, (10) authors, (11) artists, (12) merchants, and (13) travelers for curiosity or pleasure\\". The law also increased the head tax to $8 per person, and ended the exclusion of Mexican workers from the head tax. Aftermath Almost immediately, the provisions of the law were challenged by southwestern businesses. U.S. entry into World War I, a few months after the law's passage, prompted a waiver of the Act's provisions on Mexican agricultural workers. It was soon extended to include Mexicans working in the mining and railroad industries; these exemptions continued through 1921. The act was modified by the Immigration Act of 1924, which imposed general quotas on the Eastern Hemisphere and extended the Asiatic barred zone to Japan. During World War II, the U.S. modified the immigration acts with quotas for their allies in China and the Philippines. The Luce‚ÄìCeller Act of 1946 ended discrimination against Asian Indians and Filipinos, who were accorded the right to naturalization, and allowed a quota of 100 immigrants per year. The Immigration Act of 1917 was later altered formally by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, known as the McCarran-Walter Act. McCarren-Walter extended the privilege of naturalization to Japanese, Koreans, and other Asians,\\"Commentary on Excerpt of the McCarran-Walter Act, 1952,\\" American Journal Online: The Immigrant Experience, Primary Source Microfilm, (1999), Reproduced in History Resource Center, Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Group, February 9, 2007 revised all previous laws and regulations regarding immigration, naturalization, and nationality, and collected them into one comprehensive statute.\\"McCarran- Walter Act,\\" Dictionary of American History, 7 vols, Charles Scribner's Sons, (1976), Reproduced in History Resource Center, Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Group, February 9, 2007 Legislation barring homosexuals as immigrants remained part of the immigration code until passage of the Immigration Act of 1990.

It is located on the main island of Saint Kitts and the parish capital is Cayon. Land The parish's offer forest-draped mountains in the northern interior, with the more scrub-like covered Canada Hills near the southern interior borders. The coastline is marked by the beautiful (but dangerous due to Atlantic Waves) black-sand beach of Hermitage Bay on the North Coast. Sheer cliffs dominate the rest of the coastline, but to the extreme South of this lies a long continuous strip of sand that stretches from Saint Mary Cayon, into Saint Peter Basseterre and eventually into Saint George Basseterre, the sands lightening in hue as one descends southward. The beaches of Saint Mary Cayon are used by Leatherback turtles to lay their eggs. The town of Cayon dominates the central portion of the parish, with the smaller villages of Lodge and Ottley's to the North. All the lands surrounding these villages are covered in peasant farms and abandoned sugar cane estates, up to above sea level, when forests take over. There are many notable ravines in the parish, indicating that it may be one of the oldest parts of island, after the South East Peninsula. Lodge ghaut is the largest ghaut on St. Kitts and is home to the Lodge Rail bridge, the highest bridge in the federation, nearly above the ghaut floor. The Cayon river, around which the town of Cayon is situated, is one of only four year-long watered rivers on the island, and the only one on the island's East Coast (the other three being Wingfield River and East River in Saint Thomas Middle Island and Stone Fort River in Trinity Palmetto Point). The water systems around Cayon however, like those on the East Coast, have been tapered off for local consumption. The Southern border of the parish is marked by Wash Ghaut, a deep, wide, canyon-like ravine. Town/Villages The parish capital is the town of Cayon. Other villages are Key's, Ottley's and Lodge. There are all located near the main road in the parish central zone. The fertile farmlands are also in the zone. Capital - Cayon Other Villages: *Lodge *Ottley's *Little Italy *Spooner's *Keys Economy The Saint Mary Cayon Parish was historically one of the main industrial areas in Saint Kitts, home to the island's Cotton Ginnery, which was opened in 1901. It made history as its home estate, Spooner's Estate, became the first one in the Caribbean to successfully change from sugar production to cotton. The factory remained open until its acquisition by the government in 1970, shortly after which it was closed down. Since then, no significant industrial development has taken place in the parish, despite Cayon being a sizeable town. Agriculture dominates today's parish economy. The main crops produced are fruits and ground provisions, with livestock production in the parish being especially high. The second industry of the parish is tourism. A mile inland from Ottley's village lies Ottley's Plantation Inn, a former plantation house and one of the premier hotels on the island. The parish is also noted for its large water stores, which supply much of the East Coast.

It is the second smallest parish on St. Kitts, and third smallest in the federation. The parish capital is Saint Paul Capisterre Village. Land The coastline of Saint Paul Capisterre is riddled with many small bays, with thin strands of stoney black volcanic sand. Sheer cliffs form an immediate backdrop to these beaches, lining the entire coast. The rough Atlantic Ocean pummels the shoreline, and thus all settlements in the parish are inland. Saint Paul Capisterre consists mostly of flat and gently sloping terrain, which is almost completely covered by abandoned sugar estates, with small farm holdings dotting in between. Further inland, where the terrain begins to rise sharply on the slopes of Mount Liamuiga, agricultural dominance gives way to lush tropical rain forests. This coupled with views of neighbouring Statia, Saba, St. Barths and St. Martin make it a very photogenic area. Villages Capital ‚Äì St. Paul Capisterre Village (St. Paul's) Other Villages: *Belmont Estate *Cranston Estate *Newton Ground The parish consists of two large villages, Saint Paul Capisterre (St. Paul's) and Newton Ground, and their two subsidiary villages, Belmont Estate and Cranston Estate respectively. All settlements are inland. The village of St. Paul's is home to the former national leader, Dr. Denzil Llewellyn Douglas, and was also the hometown of the nation's first premier Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw. Economy The parish of Saint Paul Capisterre is the most agricultural in the entire nation, its rich volcanic soils, gentle terrain and high rainfall all owing to its successes. The bulk of the population once toiled on the surrounding sugar cane estates, however, the local sugar industry was shut down in 2005, following plummeting world sugar prices and a growing national deficit. More residents from Saint Paul Capisterre were left unemployed than in any other parish. To ease the burden of unemployment, tracts of land have been leased and sold to former sugar workers and are now used to produce a wide variety of other produce. Tourism is also an industry in the parish. The Rawlin's Plantation Inn, in the parish's eastern interior, employs some local persons. There is a restaurant located at the inn as well as an atelier owned by British artist, carver, sculptor and weaver Kate Spencer. She also owns a display and shop in Basseterre. Her works include still life, watercolor prints St. Kitts/Nevis style, silk pareos and an array of souvenir material adorned with her colorful images. Belmont Estate, whose name graces the local Belmont Estate rum, is of cultural significance; home of the legend of 'The Bull' in local folklore. It is also the start point for hikes by Greg's Safari Tours and other thrill seeking companies. Future developments To ease the burden of unemployment in the parish, major plans are in the future to develop a large hotel / villa complex on the foothills of Mount Liamuiga near the village of Saint Paul's. The project, named 'Kittitian Heights,' will feature an artist's village, state of the art recording facilities, and hotel and villa developments all in the lush tropical setting. Initial construction has already commenced.

The Chattahoochee National Forest is composed of an eastern and western forest. The western forest contains Johns Mountain, Little Sand Mountain, and Taylor Ridge. The combined total area of the Chattahoochee‚ÄìOconee National Forest is , of which the Chattahoochee National Forest comprises and the Oconee National Forest comprises . The county with the largest portion of the eastern forest is Rabun County, Georgia, which has within its boundaries. Wildlife Numerous animals can be found in this forest including birds such as species of hawk, species of owl, blackbirds, ducks, eagles, sparrows, hummingbirds, geese, and cardinals. Mammalian species that roam in the forest are American black bear, shrew, coyote, a variety of bats, squirrel, beaver, river otter, bobcat, deer, weasel, mice, and foxes. The forest is known to be home to the mysterious blue glow of the Blue ghost firefly, Phausis reticulata and many species of fish and amphibians swim in the many streams and lakes; also various species of reptile inhabit the forest.  History  The Chattahoochee National Forest takes its name from the Chattahoochee River whose headwaters begin in the North Georgia mountains. The River and the area were given the name by the English settlers who took the name from the Indians living here. The Cherokee and Creek Indians inhabited North Georgia. In one dialect of the Muskogean languages, Chatta means stone; ho chee, marked or flowered. These marked or flowered stones were in the Chattahoochee River at a settlement near Columbus, Georgia. Anna Ruby Falls In 1911, the United States Forest Service purchased of land in Fannin, Gilmer, Lumpkin and Union Counties from the Gennett family for $7 per acre. This land was the beginning of what would become the Chattahoochee National Forest. The initial land purchases became a part of the Cherokee National Forest on June 14, 1920. Ranger Roscoe Nicholson, who was the first forest ranger in Georgia and had advised the Forest Service in its initial land purchases, continued the growth of the Chattahoochee by negotiating the purchase of most of the Forest Service land in what is now the Chattooga River Ranger District. The Coleman River Scenic Area near Clayton, Georgia was dedicated to \\"Ranger Nick\\", as he was called, in honor of his promotion of conservation ideals. Ranger Arthur Woody also promoted conservation and was a key figure in the early development of the Chattahoochee. Unwise land and resource use had caused the deer and trout populations to virtually disappear in the North Georgia mountains and Woody brought trout and deer back to the area. The trout were shipped to Gainesville, hauled across the narrow, dirt, mountain roads and eventually released in the streams. Woody also purchased fawns with his own money, and fed them until they could be released on what became the Blue Ridge Wildlife Management Area. Many landmarks in the Chattahoochee bear Ranger Woody‚Äôs name in tribute to his work. Sosebee Cove, a tract of prize hardwood along GA 180 is set aside as a memorial to Woody, who negotiated its purchase for the Forest Service. Woody also helped build a school, in Suches GA, where he was born, which was later named after him, Woody Gap School, the smallest public school in Georgia. current enrollment is around 60 students total, K-12. On July 9, 1936, the Forest Service was reorganized to follow state boundaries and President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed the Chattahoochee a separate National Forest. In 1936, the Chattahoochee was organized into two Ranger Districts, the Blue Ridge and the Tallulah. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed of federal lands in central Georgia as the Oconee National Forest. The Oconee then joined the Chattahoochee to become the Chattahoochee‚ÄìOconee National Forests of today. The Chattooga River was designated a Wild and Scenic River during the 1970s. The Chattooga remains one of the few free-flowing streams in the Southeast and is known for its white water rafting and scenery. The movie Deliverance was filmed on the Chattooga River, which became the fictional Cahulawassee River in the movie.  Today General map of the Chattahoochee‚ÄìOconee National Forest. The Chattahoochee National Forest today covers 18 north Georgia counties. The Chattahoochee currently has three ranger districts: * Blue Ridge Ranger District, Office in Blairsville, GA * Chattooga River Ranger District, Office in Lakemont, GA * Conasauga Ranger District, Office in Chatsworth, GA It includes over of rivers and streams (including about of trout streams). There are over of hiking and other recreation trails, and of \\"roads.\\" In addition to the Chattooga River and the headwaters of the Chattahoochee River, natural attractions within it boundaries include the beginning of the Appalachian Trail, Georgia's highpoint, Brasstown Bald and Anna Ruby Falls. The Chattahoochee also includes ten wildernesses that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, all of which are managed by the United States Forest Service. Parts of these wilderness extend outside Chattahoochee National Forest, as indicated. The wildernesses are: #Big Frog Wilderness (Cherokee NF in Tennessee and Chattahoochee NF in Georgia) #Blood Mountain Wilderness #Brasstown Wilderness #Cohutta Wilderness (Chattahoochee NF in Georgia and Cherokee NF in Tennessee) #Ellicott Rock Wilderness (Nantahala NF in North Carolina; Sumter NF in South Carolina; and Chattahoochee NF in Georgia) #Mark Trail Wilderness #Raven Cliffs Wilderness #Rich Mountain Wilderness #Southern Nantahala Wilderness (Chattahoochee NF in Georgia and Nantahala NF in North Carolina) #Tray Mountain Wilderness The Oconee National Forest today is spread over eight Georgia counties and is organized into one ranger district.

Point of Rocks has an elevation of . History counties affected by the Dust Bowl between 1935 and 1938 originally prepared by the Soil Conservation Service. The most severely affected counties are colored . The present-day Cimarron National Grassland was the territory of the Comanche and other Indian tribes allied to them. In 1822, William Becknell was the first to traverse the Santa Fe Trail by wagon, pioneering the alternate route called the Cimarron cut-off which passed through the National Grassland. Middle Spring was one of the three reliable sources of good water along more than of the Cimarron Cutoff trail. In or near the Grassland, mountain man Jedediah Smith was killed by Comanches in 1831. In 1879, the Beaty Brothers established Point of Rocks Ranch, the first in the area. Wheat farmers soon moved in and prospered in wet years, but the drought of the 1930s caused the Dust Bowl. Morton County, Kansas was the most devastated county in the nation. The Federal government bought land from bankrupt farmers, restored the original prairie, and in 1960 the Cimarron National Grassland was created. The grassland is dedicated to \\"water conservation, wildlife management, recreation, cattle grazing, and mineral production.\\" Cattle are grazed and oil and gas wells are found on the Grassland. In May 2011, there was a substantial wildfire known as the Tunner Fire, which blanketed approximately one half of the park along with several thousands of acres of private prairie and the campground. However, rains in the spring of 2012 have brought about a significant turnaround. The land has greened up and the park's management is reopening many of its sections. Recreation Point of Rocks. In the background is the wooded valley of the Cimarron River. Access to most of the recreation opportunities in the Cimarron National Grassland are reached north of Elkhart via highway 27. Activities include camping, hiking, horseback riding, fishing, hunting, and a car tour. The grassland includes of the Santa Fe National Historic Trail. The ruts left by wagon trains are still visible. A mowed strip of land, called a companion trail, long, runs alongside the Santa Fe Trail. The Turkey Trail is long and runs through the wooded area along the Cimarron River. The Cimarron Recreation area offers tent and trailer camping, picnicking, a group site, and access to the Turkey Trail. Several fishing ponds, including four at the Cimarron Recreation Area, are stocked with rainbow trout in the winter and channel catfish in the summer. Other sport fish include crappie, sunfish, and largemouth bass. Animals hunted include whitetail deer, pronghorn, prairie chicken, quail, pheasant, prairie dog and jack rabbit. A car tour of approximately on mostly dirt roads leads to most of the points of interest on the Grassland, including a prairie dog town, Point of Rocks, and the Santa Fe Trail. The Cimarron Grassland has a population of rare lesser prairie chickens and has two viewing areas. The males perform their courting rituals from mid-March until early June. Elk were reintroduced into the Grassland in 1981 and a herd of 50 is maintained. Hunting by special permit is sometimes allowed to thin the herd.

It is located on the main island of Saint Kitts and the parish capital is Monkey Hill. Land The parish's consists of forest- covered rugged hills and mountains in the North west and interior, climaxing at the near Olivee's Mountain. Another notable feature is Monkey Hill, which rises to over above sea level. It lies just South-East of Olivee's Mountain. The ridge of hills in the North continues Eastward to the Canada hills before breaking to the Conaree Hills. South of this Northern ridge lies the flat and fertile Basseterre Valley, home to the Monkey Hill Village and most of the other settlements of the parish. It is also home to many peasant farms and also the Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport, which serves the island. The coastline is marked by a long continuous strip of sand that stretches from Saint Mary Cayon, into Saint Peter Basseterre and eventually into Saint George Basseterre, the sands lightening in hue as one descends southward. Notable areas along the stretch are Barker's Point and Conaree Beach. The beaches of Saint Peter Basseterre are used by Leatherback turtles to lay their eggs and have large reef formations offshore. Villages Capital ‚Äì Monkey Hill Other Villages: *Bayford's *Canada *Conaree *John England Village *La Fontaine *Morgan Heights *New Road *Saint Peter's *Ogee's *Parry's *Stapleton The parish capital is Monkey Hill and is located in the center of the parish. Other villages located in the central area are New Road, St. Peter's, Parry's, Ogee's, Stapleton, Bayford's and John England Village. Also, Conaree is near the seashore. The fertile lands are in the central area and also on the hillsides of the South East Range mountains. Economy Saint Peter's parish's economy is highly industrial. The Canada Estate area is home to the island's quarry site, and many subsidiary industries which manufacture blocks and ready-mixed concrete. Many of the island's trucking and heavy-equipment services are also headquartered there. The parish is also home to the island's waste disposal area, located North of the village of Conaree. The parish is also home to the island's airport, the larger of the two in the federation. Near the village of Conaree also lies two of the island's best-kept sporting facilities, used for cricket and football. The Conaree area was once home to many small inns, which hugged Conaree beach, though many have been deserted. It also once housed a gospel radio station but it was moved to Nevis in 1990. Agriculture dominates the Basseterre Valley, and peasant farmers rear livestock and grow various fruits and vegetables for local consumption on their small holdings. Tourism is not a particularly key industry in the parish, though it is home to the White House Inn and the ruins of the Ch√¢teau de la Montagne at La Fontaine, once the elaborate and lavish home of St.Kitts' famous former French governor, Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy. Ports The parish is home to the Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport, which serves the island of Saint Kitts, and is often credited as being the finest mid-sized airport in the Caribbean. There are no seaports in the parish due to the harsh Atlantic waves along the coast and the many dangerous reef formations. Community festivals There is but one community festival: the St. Peter's Fest, which is celebrated in October. Many persons from outlying villages such as Monkey Hill and Ogee's watches the splendour in this riveting festival. This festival features calypso shows, queen shows, parties, street jam sessions and late night limes (hang outs).

It is a person who already owes money to the tax authorities or wishes to avoid being liable in the future to taxation at what they consider high tax rates, instead choosing to reside in a foreign country or jurisdiction which has no taxes or lower tax rates. In general, there is no extradition agreement between countries which covers extradition for outstanding tax liabilities. Going into tax exile is a form of tax mitigation or avoidance. A tax exile normally cannot return to their home country without being subject to outstanding tax liabilities, which may prevent them from leaving the country until they have been paid. Most countries tax individuals who are resident in their jurisdiction. Though residency rules vary, most commonly individuals are resident in a country for taxation purposes if they spend at least six months (or some other period) in any one tax year in the country, and/or have an abiding attachment to the country, such as owning a fixed property. National rules =United Kingdom= A very simplified 'rule of thumb' is that under UK law a person is \\"tax resident\\" if that person meets any of the residency tests set out under the Statutory Residency Test introduced on 6 April 2014. The reality of the matter is far more complex and unclear. =United States= The worldwide income thresholds that determine whether an individual must file a U.S. tax return are exactly the same no matter where in the world a \\"U.S. person\\" lives. Under the Internal Revenue Code, a \\"U.S. person\\" (including United States citizens and U.S. permanent residents) is taxed on his or her worldwide income regardless of place of residence. U.S. persons can avoid U.S. tax liability on non-U.S. source income only by moving abroad, renouncing citizenship (or terminating or losing permanent residence), documenting that renunciation/termination/loss, and (as often required) formally exiting the U.S. tax system via IRS Form 8854. Exiting high net worth and high income individuals may owe an expatriation tax. However, if they continue to receive income from any U.S. sources, they will still be liable for U.S. taxes, often on a tax withholding basis and sometimes with less favorable tax rates (such as dividend tax rates). U.S. states and municipalities with their own tax systems sometimes have different exit rules. U.S. persons living abroad are often entitled to substantial U.S. tax relief principally through the foreign earned income exclusion, foreign housing exclusion, and/or foreign tax credit (claimed via IRS Forms 2555 and 1116). Moreover, effective U.S. income tax rates can occasionally be negative: in principle, some U.S. persons can qualify for refundable tax credits (net cash payments from the IRS) on non-excluded income even while living outside the U.S., such as the past Making Work Pay tax credit. All other U.S. tax advantages remain available in principle, such as U.S. tax-advantaged retirement and education savings accounts. No matter where they live, U.S. persons must file all required financial reports such as U.S. FinCEN Form 114. As mentioned above, a permanent resident in the United States is generally treated as a citizen for tax purposes unless his or her residency lapses or otherwise ends.

It is owned by Entercom and airs a talk radio format aimed at the African American community. WAOK has local hosts in morning and afternoon drive time with the syndicated Rev. Al Sharpton Show heard in early afternoons. WAOK broadcasts from studios at Colony Square in Midtown Atlanta. It is Atlanta's third-oldest continuously licensed broadcast station and the fifth oldest in Georgia. WAOK is a Class B station. It is powered at 25,000 watts during the daytime using a non-directional antenna. But to protect other stations on AM 1380 at night, when radio waves travel farther, it reduces power to 4,200 watts and uses a directional antenna. The transmitter is on Chalmers Drive NW in Atlanta, near the Ralph David Abernathy Freeway (Interstate 20).Radio-Locator.com/WAOK WAOK is also heard on the HD-3 subchannel of sister station 103.3 WVEE. History =WATL= The station signed on in 1931 as WATL.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 28 It began broadcasting on 1370 kilocycles, at 100 watts, and was owned by Oglethorpe University. By 1940, the station was owned by the Atlanta Broadcasting Company and had its power increased to 250 watts. WATL was Atlanta's network affiliate for the Mutual Broadcasting System.Broadcasting Yearbook 1940 page 112 With the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) in 1941, the frequency shifted to 1400 kHz, but the station was still only powered at 250 watts. By contrast, AM 750 WSB was powered at 50,000 watts and AM 590 WAGA (now WDWD) was running 5,000 watts. In the 1940s, the station got Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permission to move to 1380 kHz. It increased its power to 5,000 watts around the clock, using a directional antenna after sunset to protect other stations on AM 1380.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 116 =WAOK R&B;= On March 15, 1954, WATL changed its call sign to WAOK.Broadcasting Yearbook 1956 page 102 It adopted a rhythm and blues and traditional black gospel music format. Featured performers included legendary R&B; disc jockey Zenas \\"Daddy\\" Sears and local musician Piano Red, as well as early shock jock Alley Pat Patrick and singer Zilla Mays, the \\"Dream Girl\\", who broadcast sultry talk and soft music in the early-morning hours. The studios were moved from 201 Henry Grady Building to a new facility at 70 Houston Street NE. WAOK was acquired by The Atlanta OK Broadcasting Company in January 1956. Stan Raymond, Zenas Sears and Dorothy Lester each were one third owners. The AOK designation preceded the popular astronaut slang expression A-OK by many years. =Ray Charles concert= At a WAOK-sponsored concert held at Herndon Stadium in Atlanta on May 28, 1959, Sears used an Ampex monaural recorder and a single microphone to make one of the most famous live albums of its time, Ray Charles in Person (Atlantic 8039). The recording was unsolicited, but after Sears had listened to what he'd recorded, he sent the tape to Charles' label, Atlantic Records, which paid Sears royalties that put his twins through college. The recording is famous not only as a documentary of Ray Charles's music before he became a crossover star, but also for its technical excellence, capturing the band, the crowd, and the singer in balance. The final song in the concert was the premiere of \\"What'd I Say.\\" WAOK turned it into a hit even though there was no released version. Both \\"What'd I Say\\" and \\"Tell The Truth\\" had been recorded in the same session in New York City on February 18th, 1959, but the album What'd I Say would not be released until October 19th, 1959, and the studio version of \\"Tell The Truth\\" was never released until 2005 (Pure Genius: The Complete Atlantic Recordings 1952-1959.) https://www.jazzdisco.org/atlantic- records/discography-1959/ =Changes in ownership= By 1957, the station was on the air 24 hours a day. The studios were moved again in 1959 to 110 Edgewood Road NE and the station's licensee name was changed to the WAOK Broadcasting Company. It was changed again in 1962 to The Atlanta OK Broadcasting Company. On November 29, 1963, Stan Raymond and Zenas Sears became fifty percent owners of WAOK's licensee, acquiring the late Dorothy Lester's 33% interest for $57,786 from a local bank serving as the executor of her estate. The studios were moved to new quarters at 75 Piedmont Road. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted approval for the sale of the station on April 1, 1974, to Broadcast Enterprise Network, Inc. Ragan Augustus Henry, a Philadelphia attorney, headed the new organization as President and 53% owner. He founded BENI (Broadcast Enterprises National, Inc.) in 1974 as a Black-owned business venture. BENI took control of the station May 14, 1974. In late May 1982, studios and offices were relocated to 401 West Peachtree Street. On July 9, 1985, WAOK was sold again, this time to the DKM Broadcasting Corporation.Broadcasting Yearbook 1986 page B-68 DKM (Dyson Kissner-Moran) sold Atlanta's AM 590 WPLO (now WDWD) to buy WAOK. That paired WAOK with Urban Contemporary FM station 103.3 WVEE, which DKM also owned. In the summer of 1985, WAOK revamped its programming format. It now aired R&B; music with gospel music heard early weekday mornings and on Sundays. The studios were then moved to 120 Ralph McGill Blvd. On January 1, 1988, all DKM- owned properties were sold for $200 million, including stations in Denver, Baltimore, Akron, Dayton and Dallas, as well as WAOK and WVEE in Atlanta. The buyer was the Summit Communications Group, Inc. While WVEE concentrated on Urban Contemporary music, WAOK became a full-time gospel music station. In March 1995, Summit sold its interests in WAOK and WVEE to Granum Communications, Inc. (Herbert W. McCord, Peter Ferrara, and Michael Weinstein). =CBS and Entercom= On March 15, 1996, Granum Communications sold WAOK and WVEE to Infinity Broadcasting, a division of CBS Radio. On December 26, 2001, WAOK switched from urban contemporary gospel to a talk radio format aimed at the African American community in Atlanta. Tony Brown was named Program Director of the \\"New WAOK‚ÄîThe Voice of the Community.\\" On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom.RadioInsight.com \\"CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom\\" The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.

It is the administrative seat of Amt (\\"collective municipality\\") Lebus. The town, located on the west bank of the Oder river at the border with Poland, was the centre of the historical region known as Lubusz Land, which provides the name for the present-day Polish Lubusz Voivodeship. Geography View across the Oder river Lebus is situated in the southeast of M√§rkisch- Oderland District, on a ridge at the left bank of the middle Oder river, which since the implementation of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line in 1945 marks the eastern German border with Poland. The town centre is located about north of Frankfurt (Oder). The municipal area comprises the localities of Lebus proper, Mallnow, Sch√∂nflie√ü, and Wulkow. Sch√∂nflie√ü Dorf station is a stop on the Eberswalde‚ÄìFrankfurt (Oder) railway line served by the Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn carrier. History Settlement in the Lebus region has been traced as far back as 3,000 years. The ridges provided natural defense and led to fortifications being constructed upon them. The Germanic Lombards and Semnoni are believed to have lived in the area before the Common Era. After the Migration Period, since approximately 7th century AD, the area was inhabited by the Slavic Leubuzzi tribes, part of the West Slavic Veleti federation which later were called Lutici in Saxon sources. They were considered to be transitional between the Polabian Slavs and Polans settling in the east. Their lands on both sides of the Oder river became known as Terra Lebusana (\\"Land of the Leubuzzi\\" in Latin, Polish: Ziemia Lubuska). The region was under Polish control by 966 under the rule of the Piast duke Mieszko I and his son Boles≈Çaw I the Brave. The settlement itself was mentioned as a town Liubusua and Libusua urbs in the annals of Thietmari merseburgiensis episcopi chronicon written in the years 1012 - 1018 (under the rule of Boles≈Çaw) by the Saxon bishop and chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg.\\"Thietmari meseburgensis episcopi chronicon\\", Fridericus Kurze, Hannoverae, Impensis Bibliopolii Hahniani, 1889, page 16 and page 59. The Polish rulers had a castellany built at the river to control it. Duke Boles≈Çaw allied with Emperor Otto III to fight against the Polabian Lutici tribes, sealed in the 1000 Congress of Gniezno. On the other hand, in 13th-century chronicles, Lebus was named \\"the key to the Kingdom of Poland\\" and as a Polish stronghold against German invasion.Piastowie. Leksykon biograficzny, Krak√≥w 1999, page 409 The Bishopric of Lubusz was founded in 1124-25 AD, during the reign of the Polish duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth to counter and convert the resistant tribes of the Liutizi federation. Dedicated to Saint Adalbert of Prague, it served as an important centre for Christian missionaries preaching in and developing the Oder region. Over the centuries, Lubusz Land turned out to be a battleground for neighbouring rulers. It was especially influenced by the Silesian Piasts, dukes in the Polish Silesia province stretching up the Oder in the southeast. Lubusz Land became part of the Duchy of Silesia in 1138, after the death of duke Boles≈Çaw and the fragmentation of Poland. When in 1163 the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa campaigned Silesia to support the sons of W≈Çadys≈Çaw II the Exile against their Piast cousins, he also granted Lubusz Land on both sides of the Oder as a fief to the Silesian Piasts. German colonization of the region proceeded throughout the 13th century and the settlement became predominantly known as Lebus. The Silesian duke Henry the Bearded granted its citizens town privileges in 1226. After the death of Henry's son Duke Henry II the Pious in the 1241 Battle of Legnica, the Silesian Piasts were no longer able to maintain their dominant position. For a short time, Lubusz Land was under the rule of Duke Mieszko, a younger son of Henry II, who died about one year later and was buried in the St. Peter's Church in Lubusz. In 1248/49 the Silesian duke Boles≈Çaw II Rogatka finally gave town and land in pledge to the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg and Archbishop Wilbrand of Magdeburg, whose forces had attacked Lubusz Land since the 1230s. St. Mary's Church The Brandenburg margraves eventually took over control and during the Late Middle Ages, Lebus served as an important stop on trade routes from the Baltic coast to Italy and from the Greater Polish residence in Pozna≈Ñ to Flanders. However, after the destruction of the town's cathedral by troops of Emperor Charles IV in 1373, during the struggle between the Imperial Houses of Wittelsbach and Luxembourg Luxemburg over the Brandenburg heritage, the seat of the bishopric was moved from Lebus to F√ºrstenwalde. The populace became Lutheran during the Protestant Reformation, and the bishopric was finally secularized in 1555 following the death of the last Catholic bishop, Georg von Blumenthal. Palace in Wulkow in 1904 After the 16th century fires and political changes weakened the fortifications; the castle was decisively damaged by a lightning strike in 1713. Lebus gradually became a backwater locality. From 1701 onwards, Lebus was part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, it was administered within the newly established Prussian Province of Brandenburg. During the last stage of World War II, Lebus, including its medieval center, was almost completely destroyed in the Battle of the Seelow Heights. While the town itself remained part of East Germany, the area east of the Oder passed to the Republic of Poland in 1945 according to the Potsdam Agreement. The parish church of Lebus was restored in 1954. Since the last administrative reform of Poland, one of the 16 Polish provinces has been named Lubusz Voivodeship or Province of Lebus.

It ranks 6th in terms of size of all the parishes on Saint Kitts. The parish capital is Trinity. Land The coastline of the parish consists of small strips of black volcanic sand with intermittent stretches of rocky shore. A backdrop of sheer cliffs line the entire parish coast. Two long projections, Bloody Point and Palmetto Point can also be found, and both proved to be quite significant to the British, housing two of the island's largest forts. The parish's villages are perched very near the coast, with the lowland terrain being used for agricultural purposes (mainly dominated by abandoned sugar estates), and the mountainous terrain overgrown with tropical forests. The unusually high grade of the land in this parish is responsible for its small amount of agricultural land per total area and also one of the lowest population densities on the island.

Other villages include Mattingley, Camps, Hummingbird, West Farm, Boyd's and Stone Fort, also known as Bloody Point, home of the infamous Kalinago Genocide of 1626. Economy Due to its close proximity to the capital city, Basseterre, yet away from the bustle, the parish has recently become a top-notch choice for the island's wealthy to reside, mainly in the high-price communities of Mattingley Heights, Hummingbird and West Farm. The main industry in the parish is uniquely that of education. The village of West Farm is home to three universities: The Robert Ross Nursing University, the University of Medicine and Health Sciences (St. Kitts), and the Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine. All were founded by American businessman Robert Ross, and the veterinary school was purchased by DeVry Education Group in 2003, which later changes names to Adtalem Global Education. The other main industry is tourism. The Trinity Inn, located in the village of Palmetto Point is a small complex of inexpensive flats. The Fairview Inn, nestled at the base of the mountains above the village of Boyd's was the island's first functioning hotel.

In England in the 17th century a clash developed between these courts, representing the crown's authority, and common law courts. Prerogative courts included the Court of the Exchequer, the Court of Chancery, and the Court of the Star Chamber. Their procedures were flexible and not limited by common law procedures. The Star Chamber became a tool of Charles I employed against his enemies, and was abolished by parliament. A parallel system of common law courts was grounded in Magna Carta and property rights; the main common law courts were the Court of the King's Bench and the Court of Common Pleas . Canterbury and York The term also applied to one of the English provincial courts of Canterbury and York having jurisdiction over the estates of deceased persons. They had jurisdiction to grant probate or administration where the diocesan courts could not entertain the case owing to the deceased having died possessed of goods above a set value in each of two or more dioceses. The Prerogative Court of Canterbury (PCC) was a church court under the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury, which was responsible for the probate of wills and trials of testamentary causes where the value of the goods involved was greater than five pounds, and the property was held in two (or more) dioceses within Great Britain. While wills might also be proven at York, Canterbury's jurisdiction covered Southern England (including London) and Wales. Its archive also contains large numbers of wills relating to individuals who died abroad, but who owned property in Britain. In the period between 1680 and 1820 the Court proved on average 3,700 wills a year, including large numbers of Irish and colonial wills, and those of soldiers and sailors who died while in service.The jurisdiction of the prerogative courts was transferred to the Court of Probate in 1857 by the Court of Probate Act 1857, and is now vested in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice by the Judicature Act. Dublin The same term was used to describe the Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of Armagh, latterly established at Henrietta Street, in Dublin, which proved the wills of testators dying with assets of value greater than ¬£5 (\\"bona notabilia\\") in at least two Irish dioceses. This court was also abolished by the Court of Probate Act 1857.Index to the Prerogative Wills of Ireland, 1536‚Äî 1810.

History Dartford players were reckoned by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, writing in his diary in 1723, to \\"lay claim to the greatest excellence\\" among English cricketers. The club played a number of big matches against London and, in 1756, they were involved in a tri-series against the sport's rising power, the Hambledon Club. Dartford produced several famous players in the 18th century including cricket's earliest known great player William Bedle. Later players included William Hodsoll, John Bell, John Frame and Ned Wenman. The club originally used Dartford Brent, an area of common land, as its ground. By the end of the 18th century it had moved to Bowman's Lodge on Dartford Heath before its current ground at Hesketh Park was established in 1905. In 2002 the club merged with Dartford Halls Cricket Club, retaining the name Dartford Cricket Club for its First XI.Merger gives town's cricket more clout, Kent Online, 2002-03-21.

Retrieved 2016-09-26. In development since 1991, it was introduced to the public in 2003. This tremolo was developed in San Diego CA at AJ manufacturing by tool makers Jerry Morhman, Richard J Price, Steve Lamms, and Kerry L Stottlemyer under the direct guidance of Floyd Rose himself. With Richard J Price doing the majority of the design work and machining of the prototypes. Over 3000 hours and $150,000 were spent in developing this new ground breaking tremolo system and the first working unit on a guitar body. It inherited the locking floating bridge principle from the original version, but improved usability and diminished most of disadvantages that the Floyd Rose Original was criticized for, while adding the inconvenience of needing special-purpose strings. The Floyd Rose SpeedLoader is available in Tremolo, Fixed Bridge, and Convergent Tuning forms. However, the issues with strings became more apparent, as the specially made strings for the Speedloader were discontinued due to quality control issues. With no strings currently being manufactured, there is no way to properly string and set up any guitar with the Floyd Rose Speedloader. Customers have voiced their discontent with Floyd Rose for a lack of development of any parts that could remedy the situation. Floyd Rose SpeedLoader Fixed Bridge Floyd Rose Convergent Tuning SpeedLoader bridge  Differences from the Floyd Rose Original  The SpeedLoader bridges differ from the original 1977 bridges in that the procedure for changing strings has been made easier. The original string replacement procedure involved cutting the ball-end from a new guitar string, \\"locking\\" the freshly cut end into the bridge using an Allen wrench, winding and rough tuning the string by using the machine heads, locking the string at the nut (the second lock of the double-locking system), and finally tuning it utilizing the fine tuners. When old strings are replaced with new strings, the tension provided on the floating bridge becomes slightly different, meaning that adjusting the tuning of one string with its machine head will undoubtedly alter the tuning of the other strings. During the process of rough tuning a Floyd Rose equipped guitar, the locking nut is usually left unlocked throughout the entire string replacement procedure, which facilitates adjusting the tuning of all the strings using the machine heads. However, the SpeedLoader bridge utilizes specially manufactured strings. The strings are pre-cut to a very precise length (to sound very close to the right pitch when installed) and have special ends which snap into the bridge and nut. Once the replacement strings are in place, fine-tuning is performed in a fashion similar to the Floyd Rose Original bridge. The process for changing strings is simpler and faster; trained guitar technicians are able to change all 6 strings in under 30 seconds. Consequently, guitars with Floyd Rose SpeedLoader bridges do not need any machine heads at all. For example, Floyd Rose Redmond series guitars come with a purely decorative headstock - unlike, for example, the Steinberger instruments without any visible headstock. As with any guitar, ambient temperature, humidity, and string wear can affect the tuning. If the fine tuners alone are not enough to tune guitar properly, the SpeedLoader bridge has range tuning screws, one for each string, that control the range of each fine tuner's action. Like the original Floyd Rose bridge, the SpeedLoader bridge is a truly \\"floating\\" bridge and has some of the same disadvantages associated with it. Often, to alleviate these disadvantages, Floyd Rose Original owners utilize a custom mechanism called a tremstopper that is able to lock the floating tremolo fully (or partially) and make it behave like a fixed bridge. The Floyd Rose SpeedLoader Tremolo includes a built-in tremstopper. Finally, according to multiple interviews, Floyd Rose Guitars would not license manufacturing of these bridges to third-party vendors, as previous experience with Floyd Rose Licensed bridges showed that such \\"licensed\\" bridges cannot match original standards of quality.  Advantages  * All the advantages of Floyd Rose Original, including ability to bend notes both up and down, wide bending range and extremely stable string tuning. * Eliminates most of disadvantages of the original system, including long and tedious process of instrument restringing, balancing the tremolo, etc. * Built-in tremstopper.  Disadvantages  * The most criticized disadvantage of new tremolo system is a requirement of special strings with bulleted ends. Strings should be precisely cut and should not stretch (so called \\"string float\\") non-elastically much from original length with applied tension, changing the pitch. String should be perfectly elastic in the range of Floyd Rose action. All these requirements make string manufacturing harder than normal, thus, generally, prices for such strings tend to be higher. So far, there was only one company producing such special strings: Dean Markley, though the packaging of the strings features nowhere the company name and only the \\"Floyd Rose SpeedLoader\\" logos. To date, the company no longer produces the strings and Floyd Rose Speedloader owners have no purchase options for new strings with the company itself providing no updates on when they might be available again. The other factor is string availability: it's virtually impossible to find such strings on sale in some regions, and prices for such rare imported goods may go up to 400-500%. Note that as of 1/26/2017, 14 years after the bridge was released to the public, you cannot buy these strings anywhere. Without the ability to replace strings, these bridges are essentially useless. If a speedloader string breaks, it must be replaced completely - one cannot just shift and re-use the rest of string length as is sometimes, but very rarely, possible with other bridges.

It is one of five parishes on the island, and has a total population of about 2,500. The five parishes, in combination with the nine parishes of St. Kitts, make up the fourteen administrative parishes of the two-island Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. The parish is commonly referred to as Gingerland, and is named after the valuable ginger crop that used to be grown there. The Anglican parish church of Saint George is located within the main village of Market Shop, and Gingerland also encompasses numerous other villages such as Chicken Stone, Zetlands and Zion. Gingerland is one of the most populous parishes on Nevis, primarily because the higher parts of the parish have fertile soil and good rainfall. The parish is on the windward side of the island (meaning that it faces into the trade winds). Many of the villages in Gingerland are situated at an altitude of nearly 1,000 feet (over 300 meters), making them considerably cooler than coastal villages (especially at night). Gingerland supplies most of Nevis with fresh fruits and vegetables. The farms are mostly small holdings, where crops are grown for private consumption and for sale. The livestock include sheep and goats, which wander and graze freely; and pigs, cows and horses, which are either fenced or tethered. Feral donkeys roam freely. On the coast around Indian Castle, fishing is important economically. Tourism is an important industry in Gingerland. The main buildings of hotels such as Old Manor (now closed) and Golden Rock Estate were originally sugarcane plantation \\"great houses\\", and some of the other plantation buildings, including the old windmills, have been turned into guest suites or dining areas. A third plantation hotel in the parish is Montpelier Plantation, which is situated not far from the Botanic Garden. The island's racetrack is located in the area near Red Cliff, and the well-attended Nevis horse races take place at approximately monthly intervals.

It is located at 6, Novozavodskaya Street (near Bolshaya Filyovskaya Street). The existing church replaced a 1619 wooden church established by Mikhail Romanov, consecrated in the name of the Intercession of the Virgin to commemorate the victory over Polish troops on that day in 1618. In 1689, Fili village was acquired by Lev Naryshkin, brother of Natalia Naryshkina and uncle of Peter I. Naryshkin's two brothers were murdered during the Moscow Uprising of 1682; it is believed that Natalia saved Lev from the same fate and that Lev Naryshkin vowed to dedicate the church to his late brothers. The church was constructed between 1689 and 1694 in the shape of a Greek cross, with short, rounded annexes. It actually contains two churches: a winter Intercession Church in the basement and a summer, unheated Church of the Saviour Not Made by Hands above it. All construction records were lost in a 1712 fire, thus the exact year of completion is unknown, as well as the names of the architect and contractors (with an exception of icon painters Karp Zolotaryov and Kirill Ulanov). Both Natalia and Peter were frequent guests in Fili and donated money to the church; in the 18th century, it was equipped with a clock taken from Narva. The church was damaged by French troops in 1812 and even more by the Bolsheviks and World War II. By 1945, it lost all domes, crosses and the upper octagonal layer; the interior had been looted earlier, in 1922. It was restored in 1955-1971 (exterior) and 1971-1980 (interiors) and painted pale red, although the original color scheme remains disputed. The earliest layer of paint uncovered by restoration is pale blue; later layers are either yellow or red.

These five parishes are part of the fourteen parishes that exist within the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, a two- island country in the Leeward Islands, Lesser Antilles, West Indies. Description The parish capital of Saint John Figtree is the settlement known as Church Ground. The parish church, Fig Tree Church, is notable for being the location where the registration of the marriage between young Nevisian plantation family widow Frances Nisbet and Horatio Nelson was carried out, in 1787, when Nelson was still a young sea captain. The village of Bath is at the northwestern end of this parish, just south of Charlestown. Nearby is the Bath Hotel, which is now government offices, but which was originally (in 1778) the first tourist hotel and spa in the West Indies. Also nearby is Government House. Stoney Grove Estate, a former plantation, is located here. This parish is unique in St Kitts and St Nevis in that it is the only parish that does not allow women to serve on its parish council. Other villages within the parish are: Brown Hill, Prospect, Pembroke, Fig Tree, Brown Pasture, Cole Hill, Beach Road, and Pond Hill. The Nevis Botanical Garden is more or less centrally located in the parish, as is the hotel, Montpelier Plantation Inn. In the southernmost part of the parish is the Nevis deep-water port. Most of the coastline of this parish consists of small cliffs and coves with small beaches, many of which are not easily accessible from the land.

Location  The church marks the corner of present-day Komsomolsky Prospect and Leo Tolstoy Street, two blocks outside the Garden Ring. The church yard occupies a whole block between Leo Tolstoy and Timur Frunze streets and includes a row of small old houses. History First records of a presumably wooden church on this site are dated 1625. The main five-domed church was built in 1679-1682; bell tower and refectory were completed around 1694. Present day church sources claim that the bell tower in Khamovniki is one of the highest tent- style bell towers in Moscow region. Church of Saint Nicholas in Khamovniki In 1757 the builders added a side annex dedicated to Saint Dmitry of Rostov. The church is an example of late Muscovite Baroque that preceded short-lived Naryshkin Baroque of the 1690s. It belongs to a numerous class of bonfire temples () ‚Äì church buildings without three internal load-bearing columns, crowned with layers of small circular kokoshnik-type gables. Each gable is a symbol of a heavenly fire (biblical thrones ‚Äì angels or seraphs); a tightly packed group of gables is an architectural metaphor for the Throne of God. Small decorative columns \\"supporting\\" the lower level gables are an indicator of a Western influence in a typically vernacular building. The church was severely damaged by the fire of 1812 and reopened only in 1849. Shortly before that, in 1848, the church acquired its principal relic - a copy of Defender of the sinners icon of Theotokos from Odrin convent, donated by Dmitry Doncheskul; the icon was permanently placed in the former Saint Dmitry annex. It also possesses 17th century icons of Saint Alexis and Hodegetria of Smolensk. In 2002 the church donated its icon of Archangel Michael to the reopened church of Archangel Michael in Devichye Pole.

Despite being the smallest, it is the most important parish on Nevis, and the second most important in the entire country. Home to the capital, it houses all of Nevis' government buildings, as well as many of the island's historic sites. Land Nevis being a somewhat round island, it is divided into five parishes somewhat like a sliced pie, with each parish having a portion of coastline, and a small part of Nevis Peak in the centre. Saint Paul Charlestown has a much shorter length of coast than any other parish: only about 1/2 mile. From this developed coastline, which consists almost entirely of the Charlestown port, the parish's boundaries move inland, over gently sloping terrain, until the base of Nevis Peak is reached. From there, the land rises sharply to the peak's summit, at 3,232 feet, just 3 miles inland. The higher parts of the mountain slopes are draped in tropical forests, and the town of Charlestown dominates the coastal plain. Settlements The main settlement in Saint Paul Charlestown is the town of Charlestown. The only other settlement within the parish boundaries is a part of the village of Craddocks. Economy Saint Paul Charlestown is Nevis' economic headquarters. Most of the island's businesses are located there, and a significant portion of the island's workforce are employed in the town of Charlestown. The parish, and specifically Charlestown, is a major international financial services centre, and financial service is the main business in the parish. Port The Charlestown Port is the island's busiest port, where numerous ferries dock that service Basseterre and Montserrat. It is also used for yacht moorings.

In 1691 he founded The Athenian Society to publish The Athenian Mercury, the first major popular periodical and first miscellaneous periodical in England. In 1693, for four weeks, the Athenian Society also published The Ladies' Mercury, the first periodical published that was specifically designed just for women. Early life His father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all clergymen. He was born at Graffham, Huntingdonshire, where his father John was rector. The family shortly moved to Ireland, when John Dunton senior became chaplain to Sir Henry Ingoldsby. At the age of fifteen John the son was apprenticed to Thomas Parkhurst, bookseller, at the sign of the Bible and Three Crowns, Cheapside, London. Dunton ran away at once, but was soon brought back, and began to love books. During the struggle which led to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Dunton was the treasurer of the Whig apprentices. He became a bookseller at the sign of the Raven, near the Royal Exchange, and married Elizabeth Annesley, daughter of Samuel Annesley, whose sister married Samuel Wesley. His wife managed his business, so that he was left free in a great measure to follow his own eccentric devices. He had early success with Thomas Doolittle's The Lord's last-sufferings, the topical Stephen Jay's Daniel in the Den, and a sermon by John Shower. In New England In 1686, probably because he was concerned in the Monmouth Rebellion, he visited New England, where he stayed eight months selling books and observing with interest the new country and its inhabitants. He sailed from Gravesend in October 1685, and reached Boston after a four months' voyage. He sold his books, and visited Cambridge. In Roxbury he saw the missionary John Eliot and learnt something of Native American customs. He stayed for a time at Salem and Wenham, and returned to England in the autumn of 1686. Dunton had become security for his brother's debts, and to escape the creditors he made a short excursion to Holland. Later life On his return to England, he opened a new shop in London in the Poultry, in the hope of better times. Here, he founded in 1691 a new kind of journal, The Athenian Gazette/The Athenian Mercury, with anonymous questions-and-answers, powered by his Athenian Society. His wife died in 1697, and he married a second time; but a quarrel about property led to a separation; and being incapable of managing his own affairs, he spent the last years of his life in great poverty. In Literature Dunton received a rather backhanded compliment from Jonathan Swift in the latter's A Tale of A Tub (see p. 38 of text in 1st ed. of 1704). Works He gave an account of his travels around Ireland in Teague Land: or A Merry Ramble to the Wild Irish (1698). He gave an interesting view of the workings of the Irish Courts and brief sketches of the Irish judges, whom he praised in general as \\"men of whom no one complains\\". He was impressed by their learning: in particular he thought that Sir Henry Echlin was one of the great book lovers of his time, owning a \\"very large and curious library\\". He had an equally high opinion of Echlin's colleague Thomas Coote, another noted bibliophile. He wrote several books whose titles are today among specialists better known than their contents ranging from The informer's doom, or, An unseasonable letter from Utopia directed to the man in the moon giving a full and pleasant account of the arraignment, tryal, and condemnation of all those grand and bitter enemies that disturb and molest all kingdoms and states throughout the Christian world (1689) to his Bumography: or, A touch at the lady's tails, being a lampoon (privately) dispers'd at Tunbridge-Wells, in the year 1707. By a water- drinker. With the names and characters of the most noted water-drinkers. Also, a merry elegy upon Mother Jefferies, the antient water-dipper (1707). 19th and 20th-century criticism neglected Dunton because of his tendency to use the public for his private businesses. Both his quarrels as a publisher and as a husband were more than reflected in his publications. He would thus offer Reflections on Mr. Dunton's leaving his wife. In a letter to himself. (1700?) followed by the public proclamation of his reunion with his wife. While at the same moment he would portrait himself as a lover of privacy with his The art of living incognito being a thousand letters on as many uncommon subjects, written by John Dunton during his retreat from the world, and sent to that honourable lady to whom he address'd his conversation in Ireland (1700). His accounts of quarrels he had as a book trader and publisher offer information to book historians dealing with the period. Important titles are here his Religio bibliopolae in imitation of Dr. Browns Religio medici (1691), his The Dublin scuffle being a challenge sent by John Dunton, citizen of London (1699) and his Life and Errors of John Dunton (1705). His letters from New England were published in the U.S. in 1867. He also wrote the first periodical and the first dictionary designed specifically for women: The Ladies' Mercury - an imitation of his wider Athenian project - and acting here as the publisher more than the author: The ladies dictionary, being a general entertainment of the fair-sex, a work never attempted before in English (1694). * The informer's doom, or, An unseasonable letter from Utopia directed to the man in the moon : giving a full and pleasant account of the arraignment, tryal, and condemnation of all those grand and bitter enemies that disturb and molest all kingdoms and states throughout the Christian world.

For thousands of years traditional owners called the river Deeban, however the colonial invaders renamed the river after Henry Hacking, a British seaman who murdered Pemulway and was a pilot at Port Jackson in colonial New South Wales. Course Drawing its source from the east north-eastern runoff of the Illawarra escarpment, drained via Kellys Creek and Gills Creek. (Wollongong, New South Wales) both terminating in falls adjacent to each other. The waters of both creeks combine in the valley below, forming the Hacking River. Kellys Creek rises about south of , east of the Princes Highway and west of . The Hacking River flows generally north north-east before reaching its mouth and emptying into Port Hacking at a line between Grays Point and Point Danger, about east of the suburb of , west of . The river descends over its course. Although the Illawarra escarpment has a substantial rainfall, in dry periods, the river can be reduced to a mere trickle, resulting in connected puddles rather than a constant flow. Most of the river flows through the Garawarra State Conservation Park and the Royal National Park. However, at its upper reaches it has been subject to the impacts of urbanisation (Helensburgh and Otford), rural activities, and a large coal mine. The construction of the Princes Highway and the Sydney to Wollongong railway each have had impacts on the river. Many parts of what is now Royal National Park had been subjected to one form or another of exploitation, with consequential impacts on the river. Other impacts over time have been leachates from the Helensburgh tip, the Garrawarra Hospital sewage, and the construction of obstructions across the river. Ecology Its upper reaches lie adjacent to the Garawarra State Conservation Area, where it is a narrow stream in a gully within rainforest. The river passes through a variety of plant communities, such as dry eucalyptus forest, tall wet eucalyptus forest and rainforests. Significant rainforest plants growing by the river banks include white beech, citronella, supplejack, Bangalow palm, jackwood and golden sassafras. The blackbutt, grey ironbark and bangalay are common eucalyptus trees. As it moves downstream, it flattens and widens before it reaches the estuary at Port Hacking. A variety of molluscs, crustaceans, insects, fish and birds live in and around the river. Long finned eels migrate from oceanic spawning grounds as elvers. As adults they mature in the creeks and streams of the Royal National Park, sometimes to be seen in the river pools. Jollytail are common small fish. Platypus may occasionally be seen in the river, and azure kingfishers nest in the river banks. The land snail Meridolum marshalli is restricted to Royal National Park; its main habitat is wet areas near the river. History and human development =Aboriginal history= For more than years prior to 1840, the Tharawal (or Dharwal) people occupied the catchment area evidenced by hundreds of Aboriginal artefacts, middens, rock carvings and cave paintings. In the mid-19th century shell grit was in high demand as a source of lime for building in the Sydney district. Consequently, mud and oyster rocks were collected in large numbers from Port Hacking catchment destroying a number of aboriginal midden sites in the region. The Gweagal people lived mainly by the saltwater bays and estuaries of Port Hacking, they also used the freshwater resources of the upper Hacking River, Heathcote Creek and the Woronora River. The Gweagal people were said to be the guardians of the sacred white clay pits on their territorial land, now known as the Kurnell Peninsula. They used the clay to make body paint, medicine and when mixed with local berries it was also used as a dietary supplement. =European history= The river is crossed by four causeways at and near the village of Otford near its headwaters. At Otford below the railway station is a small dam, constructed for the supply of water for steam locomotives. A causeway is incorporated as part of the structure, which results in a substantial pond upstream. Other significant structures are the Upper Crossing (below Waterfall and above the confluence with Waterfall Creek) and at Audley. The causeway, built in 1899, at Audley within the Royal National Park. Here, mangrove flats were cleared to make way for boat-sheds and accommodation in the late 19th century. A boatshed and picnic grounds remain at Audley, having been used continuously since. Visitors can canoe and kayak further upstream along the Hacking River or its tributary Kangaroo Creek. The soft soils are vulnerable to erosion, which is exacerbated by bushwalking. Erosion is facilitated by relatively high rainfall in the Garrawarra State Conservation Area. Furthermore, runoff from the towns of Helensburgh, Otford and Stanwell Tops (which lie above the catchment) has also impacted on water quality in the river, resulting in increased turbidity and algal growth. Within the Royal National Park at , visitors have enjoyed picnic and boating facilities for more than a hundred years. A consequence of the weir was to divide the river into freshwater/saltwater tidal components. Impacts were to impede fish migration and to cause the accretion of sediment behind the weir. In flood, the road across the causeway is impassable, thus isolating the villages of Bundeena and Maianbar. As the Upper Causeway would also flood in these conditions, an all-weather bridge was built at the Upper Causeway. The tide reaches the weir, and although there is some lag, there is virtually no tidal prism. From the weir, the river continues downstream in the main through the Royal National Park, although towards its fluvial delta at Grays Point, it flows on one side through the suburbs of Kirrawee and Grays Point. It is opposite Grays Point that Muddy Creek joins the River. From this point downstream the river is characterised by large stands of mangroves and an extensive fluvial delta. Historically, the fluvial sediments below the weir have been restrictive to navigation. After the declaration of the national park, the trustees were concerned to facilitate boat access to the new park and consequently training walls were built. Subsequently, as navigation increased, there was repeated pressure for dredging. The fluvial delta has not been dredged for many years. Nonetheless, there is a well-used boating facility at Swallow Rock (Grays Point).

It is best known for the twin spire towers, which provide light into the building's interior and for housing the world's largest Foucault Pendulum. The center is owned by Metro, the Portland area's regional government, and operated by the Metropolitan Exposition and Recreation Commission. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects (ZGF). It is the largest convention center in Oregon at nearly . The complex includes of exhibit space. It features the largest ballroom in the City of Portland at . The original building was built in the late 1980s, opened in 1990, and was expanded in 2003. ZGF was also involved in designing the expansion. More recently, the building has become known for upward illuminating the twin spires yearly on September 11 in memorial of the events of 9/11. In 2008, the OCC replaced its traditional Wi-Fi Hotspots with Wi-Fi Arrays to provide wireless internet services which are sold to exhibitors and attendees. Oregon Convention Center in 2007 The building and grounds also have an extensive set of public art, with works from over two dozen mainly Pacific Northwest artists. The collection includes paintings, plaques, glass and ceramic tiles, sconces, mosaics, bells, and parts of a large Douglas fir. Each of the towers has a focal point artwork, with a colorful 40-foot-long Chinese dragon boat suspended in the east tower, and Principia by Jones/Ginzel, a dramatic Foucault pendulum hanging over a gilded halo of rays and an inlaid fantasy solar system in the floor of the north tower. The region's light rail system, TriMet's MAX, serves the center with a station on Holladay Street. The Portland Streetcar system began serving the center in 2012, with the opening of a new line called the CL Line; this was renamed the Loop Service in 2015. TriMet bus route 6 also serves the facility. Construction on a , full-block \\"outdoor plaza\\" facility for convention-related activities started in 2011 across the street from the center, to the east. The plaza, known as the Oregon Convention Center Plaza, opened in January 2012. Metro has proposed a 600-room hotel adjacent to the Convention Center, to be built by Mortenson Construction, then owned and operated as a Hyatt Regency. The $212 million hotel would be partially paid for by Metro using $60 million in revenue bonds and $18 million from Oregon Lottery funds, loans, and grants. The plan has attracted criticism from existing hoteliers as being an unfair subsidy, while Metro has championed it as a way to attract larger conventions. Suits from opponents were rejected in county courts, and in May 2015, the Oregon Legislature authorized Metro to issue the bonds. Construction of the Hyatt Regency Portland began in 2017, and the hotel opened in December 2019. The convention center was chosen as the host venue for the 2016 IAAF World Indoor Championships after Portland won their bid over Birmingham, England. For the event, the building was fitted with a 200m track and seating for 8,000 spectators. On March 20th 2020 amidst the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic the center was turned into a Portland's second temporary shelter for the homeless population of the city in order to protect them from being infected by COVID-19.

The original Bidwell Bar Bridge was the first steel suspension bridge in California. The $35,000, original was completed in December 1855, and was built of materials transported from Troy, New York, via Cape Horn. Most of the money was put up by Judge Joseph Lewis, a Virginian who moved to Bidwell's Bar in 1849. The bridge originally crossed the Middle Fork Feather River and is the only one of several suspension bridges built in the area in the 1850s that still remains. It remained open to vehicle traffic until 1954. Construction of the Oroville Dam flooded the canyon where the Feather River ran as well as the town of Bidwell's Bar, and preservationists arranged for the relocation of the bridge in 1966 to the south side of the lake, where it is still open to foot traffic. Its original site is now inundated by the lake. Looking out over the old bridge A replacement bridge was constructed in 1965 and is long. The bridge is built a mile and a half upstream from its original location. At the time, it was one of the highest suspension bridges in the world above the original streambed), but with the creation of the lake, the bridge now sits just above the water level when the lake is full. The bridge is signed as part of State Route 162. The original bridge is registered as a California Historical Landmark and it was declared a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Mother Orange Tree, the first orange tree in Northern California (purchased by Judge Lewis), is located near the California landmark commemorative plaque.

Forest Service. Ashley National Forest. Forest Service, 17 Feb. 2010. Web. 26 Feb. 2010. History Petroglyphs (rock art) found throughout the Forest suggest that the land had been hunted for centuries by Indians before the arrival of Europeans. The first white men believed to have set foot in Ashley National Forest were the Spanish explorers Dominques and Escalante, in 1776. The Forest, however, was not thoroughly explored until the early 19th century when General William Henry Ashley, an organizer of a fur company, began looking for an outlet to the Gulf of Mexico for his business. General Ashley and his team began making their way up the Green River (one of the many bodies of water located in the Forest) in the spring of 1825. After passing through the Flaming Gorge, General Ashley was convinced by the local Indians to turn around and head back up the Uinta Mountains. During his exploration, General Ashley wrote and hung his name out over one of the rivers that he had explored, which now lies below the water of the Flaming Gorge Reservoir; this is how Ashley National Forest received its name. Many other explorers would come and explore the Forest, and eventually the first settlement in Ashley National Forest was made in 1872. It was settled by Captain Pardon Dodds, who brought about 2,000 cattle into the Uintah Basin. In a few years, all of the surrounding ranges were completely stocked with cattle and horses. On July 1, 1908, by executive order of President Theodore Roosevelt, Ashley National Forest was created. The general boundaries of the Forest remained unchanged until 1953. The entire north slope of the Uinta Mountains was transferred to the Wasatch National Forest, while Ashley National Forest received the Rock Creek and Duchesne River drainages. President Lyndon B. Johnson added approximately to the Forest when he established the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area as part of Ashley National Forest in 1968. Since then, there have only been slight boundary changes to the Forest. Recreational activities With over 2.5 million visitors each year, Ashley National Forest offers many different recreational activities to its guests. The Forest contains four main byways to drive on, which take visitors through many different landmarks found in the Forest and offers them a chance to see various forms of wildlife. For people who prefer to walk, the Forest contains over of hiking trails. These trails cover the entire Forest, taking hikers from extensive forests to rugged mountains. Many of these trails are designated for off-road vehicles as well, such as motorcycles, ATVs, and snowmobiles. Along the trails there are many campgrounds available to visitors. During the winter months, there are two facilities located in the Forest called Yurts that provide cross-country skiers with overnight room rentals to escape the cold. There are also many lakes and rivers found throughout Ashley National Forest, which allows guests to take in some fishing while visiting. There are also some bodies of water in the Forest that are designated for motorized water-crafts. Uinta Mountains Occupying a large piece of Ashley National Forest are the Uinta Mountains. With a main crest stretching more than and surrounded by massive secondary ridges extending north and south, this mountain range is the largest alpine area located in the Intermountain west. This mountain range also contains Kings Peak, the highest peak in Utah at . Hundreds of lakes, streams, and meadows can be found within the many basins located in the mountain range. The Uinta Mountains are also the home to many different types of wildlife including, elk, moose, mule deer, coyotes, black bears, ptarmigan, several raptor species, beavers, marten, river otters, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, cougars, pikas, and marmots. The mountains also contain 16 designated trails () for visitors to explore from June to September. Flaming Gorge National Recreational Area The Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area is a popular recreational feature located at the Flaming Gorge Reservoir within Ashley National Forest. It is in Flaming Gorge, a partially submerged canyon on the Green River. The National Recreation Area contains of both land and water, which is divided almost evenly in Utah and Wyoming. The canyon was named by explorer John Wesley Powell, who upon first looking at the red gorge believed that it was on fire. In 1958 the Flaming Gorge Dam was completed, impounding the Green River to create the Flaming Gorge Reservoir. The reservoir is extremely popular for boaters, with five full-service marinas offering launching, storage, and maintenance facilities. Because the reservoir's water remains cool even in summer's extreme heat, it is popular with water sports enthusiasts. The reservoir and Green River upstream are known for supporting a large number of trout, which makes the recreational area a fishing destination. The river is also a river rafting destination. The recreational area has campgrounds and hiking trails along the of shoreline. There are also some secluded coves only accessible by boat.

He specializes in the Indus script.  Biography  Parpola is a brother of the Akkadian language epigrapher Simo Parpola.Helsinki University He is married to Marjatta Parpola, who has authored a study on the traditions of Kerala's Nambudiri Brahmins.  Scholarship  Parpola's research and teaching interests fall within the following topics: * Indus Civilization / Indus script and religion / Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions * Veda / Vedic ritual / Samaveda / Jaiminiya Samaveda texts and rituals / Purva-Mimamsa * South Asian religions / Hinduism / Saiva and Sakta tradition / Goddess Durga * South India / Kerala / Tamil Nadu / Karnataka * Sanskrit / Malayalam / Kannada / Tamil / Prehistory of Indian languages * Prehistoric archaeology of South Asia and (in broad sense) Central Asia / Coming of the Aryans Two significant contributions of Parpola, to the field of decipherment of the Indus script, are the creation of the now universally used classification of Indus valley seals, and the proposed, and much-debated, decipherment of the language of the script.Mahadevan Interview: Full Text = Dravidian hypothesis = According to Parpola the Indus script and Harappan language are \\"most likely to have belonged to the Dravidian family\\".The Hindu, Underlying language of Indus script, Proto-Dravidian: Asko Parpola Parpola led a Finnish team in the 1960s‚Äì80s that vied with Knorozov's Soviet team in investigating the inscriptions using computer analysis. Based on a proto-Dravidian assumption, they proposed readings of many signs, some agreeing with the suggested readings of Heras and Knorozov (such as equating the \\"fish\\" sign with the Dravidian word for fish \\"min\\") but disagreeing on several other readings.

VARALAARU.COM, Chennai. = Reception = Parpola's long journal article The Coming of the Aryans is widely cited by historians and scholars of Indo-European Studies. Colin Renfrew, who has reviewed the article, called it a \\"richly annotated and well-illustrated essay,\\" which brings together a number of different lines of arguments, including literary and archaeological. It contains rich and interesting insights into a variety of topics, including the \\"amalgamation of the Aryan and Dasa religions,\\" and the Nuristani language. However, Renfrew found Parpola's methodology wanting because, to him, it did not clearly lay out the structure of the argument and the underlying assumptions. He listed the underlying assumptions as the one that the Aryans considered themselves immigrants in the lands described in their texts and the one that the Dasas were themselves immigration populations. He considered both these propositions to be doubtful.  Awards  Asko Parpola received the Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi Classical Tamil Award for 2009 on June 23, 2010 at the World Classical Tamil Conference at Coimbatore. In 2015, he was awarded India's Presidential Award of Certificate of Honour in Sanskrit.

Lying west of Sunderland city centre on the south bank of the River Wear, South Hylton has a population of 10,317 (2001 Census). Once a small industrial village, South Hylton (with only one access road) is now a dormitory village and is a single track terminus for the Tyne and Wear Metro. South Hylton was originally known as Hylton Ferry or Low Ford, its current name not coming into regular use until the late 18th to early 19th century. It originally formed part of the Manor of Ford owned by the Barons Hylton, until the estates of Hylton Castle were sold off in 1750 after the death of the last baron. Originally a collection of farmsteads, it became a diversified industrial village as a result of the Industrial Revolution. History :See also History of Sunderland Archaeological excavations around North Hylton and South Hylton indicate the area has been occupied since at least the Mesolithic era. The remains of either a Bronze Age or Iron Age log boat and bronze swords were recovered from the nearby River Wear in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Masonry from a possible Roman bridge or dam across the Wear have been found, the local historian Robert Surtees recorded the discovery in the Wear of a Roman milestone, and Roman coins were found in the village in 1962 and 1994. An Anglo-Saxon brooch has also been discovered near Wood House Farm in North Hylton. Geography =Topography= South Hylton Pasture is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and one of the few remaining examples of lowland hay meadow in Britain, and the only example in Sunderland. The shallow, north- facing slopes of the pasture support unimproved neutral grassland, with associated wet flushes. Traditional management for hay production followed by winter grazing has maintained a herb-rich sward and supports the common blue and meadow brown butterflies. Listed buildings There are six Grade II listed buildings in the area. They are: =St Mary's Church= The first Anglican chapel in South Hylton was donated by Captain (later Admiral) Thomas James Maling (whose first wife, Harriot Darwin, was the half-aunt of Charles Darwin) in 1817 as a chapel of ease, due to the distance between the village and the mother church of St Michael's in Bishopwearmouth. It was consecrated on 15 February 1821 by Thomas Burgess, the Bishop of St Davids, and the chapelry district was formed in 1844 as a perpetual curacy.WhellanMackenzie and Ross Originally a house chapel known as Hylton Lodge, it burnt down in 1878 and was rebuilt in 1880 by Charles Hodgson Fowler. The tower was added in 1930 by George Edward Charlewood and the porch in 1970 by Ronald Sims. =41 and 42 High Street= 41 High Street dates from the late 18th century. Adjacent to 41 is 42 High Street, known as Hylton House. It is the oldest house in the village and also dates from the late 18th century. Both houses and the retaining walls outside constitute separate listed buildings. =The Golden Lion= One of the four public houses (including a working men's club) in the area is The Golden Lion, situated near the river bank. The pub has existed since at least the mid-19th century, but the current building dates to around 1910. One of its main external features is the front door stone surround commemorating the marriage of John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave, which was recovered from the north wing of Hylton Castle. The Golden Lion was extensively damaged in a blaze in 2019. =War Memorial= On 16 August 1924 the village war memorial was unveiled by Major John Rodham Wigham of Ford Villa, who donated the site. The memorial is of granite with wrought- iron railings and commemorates the villagers who died in the First World War on the west face, and those of the Second World War on the north face. Transport Road access to South Hylton is via one road, Hylton Bank. The road starts at nearby Pennywell, becoming High Street at the heart of the village, and ends at the riverbank. A railway line once ran from Sunderland to Durham from the 1850s until 1964, when the track from nearby Penshaw to Sunderland was removed following the Beeching Axe. The line was restored to the village in 2002 when South Hylton Metro station was constructed as a terminus for the Tyne and Wear Metro. South Hylton formerly had a resident bus company, W. H. Jolly, which ran frequent services from the village into Sunderland town centre. The dominance of Stagecoach which also ran a similar route, coupled with the announcement of the upcoming Tyne & Wear Metro extension to South Hylton, caused the company to close in 1995. In August 2008, Stagecoach stopped its direct route to the village after 7pm and all day Sunday. The route was restored in part, via another company, by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive (Nexus) in December 2008. Education South Hylton has its own school, South Hylton Primary Academy and St Anne's Roman Catholic Voluntary Aided Primary School is situated at the top of the village. The nearest secondary school is Academy 360 (formerly Pennywell Comprehensive School) in nearby Pennywell.

Life Edwards was born at Llan-ym-Mawddwy, Merioneth, where his father was vicar. He was educated at Westminster but left Westminster in his seventeenth year with the intention of proceeding to India, but, changing his mind, studied for twelve months under the Rev. F. E. Gretton at Stamford School.Boase, George Clement (1889). \\"Edwards, Henry Thomas\\" . In Stephen, Leslie (ed.). Dictionary of National Biography. 17. London: Smith, Elder & Co. He went up to Jesus College, Oxford (B.A., 1860), and after teaching for two years at Llandovery went to Llangollen as his father's curate. He became vicar of Aberdare in 1866 and of Carnarvon in 1869. Here he began his lifelong controversy with Nonconformity, especially as represented by the Rev. Evan Jones (Calvinistic Methodist) and Rev. E. Herber Evans (Congregationalist). In 1870 he fought in vain for the principle of allround denominationalism in the national education system, and in the same year addressed a famous letter to W. E. Gladstone on The Church of the Cymry, pointing out that the success of Nonconformity in Wales was largely due to the withering effect of an alien episcopate.Edwards, H. (1869) The Church of the Cymry: A letter to the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone. Aberdare: W. Morris One immediate result of this was the appointment of the Welshman Joshua Hughes (1807-1889) to the vacant see of St Asaph. Edwards became dean of Bangor in 1876 and at once set about restoring the cathedral, and he promoted a clerical education society for supplying the diocese with educated Welsh-speaking clergy. He was a popular preacher and an earnest patriot; his chief defect was a lack of appreciation of the theological attainments of Nonconformity, and a Welsh commentary on St. Matthew, which he had worked at for many years and published in two volumes in 1882, was severely handled by a Bangor Calvinistic Methodist minister. Edwards was also an editor on the monthly Welsh language periodical Amddiffynydd yr Eglwys. Edwards suffered from overwork and insomnia and a Mediterranean cruise in 1883 failed to restore his health. He committed suicide at the vicarage, Ruabon; the home of his brother, the Reverend E. W. Edwards.

Playing career In his baseball career, Healy played for the Kansas City Royals, San Francisco Giants and New York Yankees, accumulating a .250 career batting average. The highlight of his time with the Royals came in 1973 and 1974, when Healy caught Steve Busby's two career no-hitters, against the Detroit Tigers and Milwaukee Brewers respectively. Healy was noted for his close relationship with Reggie Jackson while on the Yankees, where he served as a mediator between the fiery slugger and Yankee manager Billy Martin as well as teammate, captain Thurman Munson. Broadcasting career After his playing career ended in 1978, he worked on radio broadcasts for the Yankees until 1981. In 1979, he added the Yankees' cable television broadcasts on SportsChannel (which became Fox Sports Net New York) to the resume, staying with the cable crew until the end of the 1983 season. Healy worked on Mets telecasts from 1984 to 2005, also working as the host of Mets Inside Pitch and Halls of Fame, a series that profiled careers of famous athletes (and originally taking its name from the cough drop company that shared the name). In 1987, Healy interviewed former President Richard Nixon during one of his post-game shows, discussing a range of baseball issues of the day. He is one of three sportscasters who was a regular announcer for both the Yankees and the Mets; the others are Tom Seaver and Tim McCarver. When Keith Hernandez was added to Mets telecasts, Healy and Hernandez's game-calling often became humorous, pointing to a sometimes-contentious relationship between the two. Healy was not signed to be part of the Mets' new cable channel, SportsNet New York, for 2006. Healy is the current host of \\"The Game 365\\" on MSG Network, in New York City.
