From 2009 to 2012, he served as Deputy of the LXI Legislature of the Mexican Congress, representing the 32nd district of the State of Mexico. Life Luna's political career took place entirely within Valle de Chalco Solidaridad. He graduated from the UNAM with a law degree in 1993 and was a member of the PRI until 2003, even serving as the municipal party president between 2002 and 2003. In 2003, he flipped to the PRD, and in that same year, he began a three-year term as municipal president. In 2006, the PRD considered running Miguel as its candidate for federal deputy but ultimately bypassed him in favor of his sister, Alma Lilia Luna Mungu√≠a, who eventually won the seat. In 2009, after the PRD briefly considered him as a candidate to return to the municipal presidency, he returned to the PRI in time to be selected as its candidate for federal deputy to the 32nd district. This time, the PRI triumphed, sending him to San L√°zaro. He was a secretary on the Citizen Participation Commission and also sat on those for the Federal District, and after November 2010, Government. In 2010, he also graduated with a diploma in administrative law from the UNAM. In 2015, Miguel √Ångel returned to the PRD in order to become its candidate for federal deputy from the 32nd district in Chalco; he would face Alma, who ran as the PRI candidate. On 2 June 2015, just five days before the election, Miguel √Ångel was shot and killed in his campaign office in Valle de Chalco Solidaridad, just meters from the cathedral where his funeral mass would be held two days later; in the attack, the PRD's candidate for municipal president of Chalco was also hurt. Later in the month, the Attorney General of the State of Mexico alleged that the murderer had been paid to kill Miguel √Ångel.

They are commonly called Caprivi rough-scaled lizards as they are largely found in southwestern Africa on the border of the Caprivi Strip. The cape rough-scaled lizards are terrestrial and found in the range of open woodland and mesic savanna. The caprivi rough-scaled lizards are medium in size and distributed in parts of Namibia and Botswana. This species is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List for endangered species as they are rare and has not been seen or collected since 1998. Data about the population or specimens collected are needed for the IUCN to obtain more information about the unknown threats that may be impacting them. Description I. grandiceps are medium-sized lizards with slender bodies, long tails, and well developed legs. They are very similar to the type species Ichnotropis capensis, except I. grandiceps have larger heads. These lizards are no more than 70 mm in snout to vent length (SVL). Identification of Ichnotropis includes the following: * Cylindrical tail without lateral fringe * Toes without serrated or fringed edge * Smooth or tubular lamellae under toes * Subocular scales bordering lip * No collar present * Keeled or overlapping dorsal scales * Head shields smooth or slightly rough The coloration of the adults consist of a uniform grey and yellowish brown backs with few scattered dark spots. A dark dorsolateral stripe that may be absent or faint, which runs from the head to the groin and breaks up into a line of lateral spots. The sides of the head and the belly are white. The juveniles have pale grey and brown backs with lateral stripes. Habitat I. grandiceps can be found in open woodland, lime soil, or white sandy areas in Southwestern Africa. There are records that report this species in Namibia, and Botswana. These lizards seek shelter in soft soiled burrows, under rocks and brush. Biology These lizards are insectivorous and feed on termites and other small insects. They are active hunters during the day. This species is rare and have not been collected in some time. =Taxonomy and evolution= Based on morphological evidence the South African genus Ichnotropis and the North American genus Psammodromus diverged from a common ancestor from the lineage of Lacerta lepida and Lacerta monticola during the Oligocene epoch (24 to 36 million years ago).Busack, Stephan & Maxson, Linda.

Jefferson is an author and editor of the Cochrane Collaboration's acute respiratory infections group, as well as part of four other Cochrane groups. He is also an advisor to the Italian National Agency for Regional Health Services. In 1999, Jefferson was one of the founding members of the Brighton Collaboration along with Harald Heijbel, Ulrich Heininger, and Elisabeth Loupi. He has worked on Cochrane reviews examining the effectiveness of the anti-viral oseltamivir and the influenza vaccine. Notable work In 2009, Jefferson was hired by the governments of Britain and Australia to update a systematic review of oseltamivir. Initially he had a great deal of trouble getting results of the original trials. Previous researchers had published trials without seeing the underlying data and it appeared that some of the published papers used ghost writers. As the company, Roche, that did the trials refused to provide data for independent analysis, their conclusions in 2009 were that benefits could not be shown. In 2011, Jefferson's team was provided 22,000 pages of data from the European Medicines Agency and Roche eventually provided 3,000 pages of data. In 2012, Jefferson was the lead author of another Cochrane review of this data which concluded that oseltamivir did not reduce the number of hospitalizations caused by influenza. Jefferson said that this review also found no evidence that oseltamivir stopped complications from the disease. His views about the effectiveness of influenza vaccines and his outspokenness about them are also controversial; at a 2007 meeting on pandemic preparedness he was shunned by other vaccine researchers and ate alone. Reviews led by Jefferson have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to show that influenza vaccines reduce mortality or infection rates. He has said that the studies claiming large reductions in mortality rates as a result of the influenza vaccine are \\"rubbish\\", and that \\"influenza vaccines are about marketing and not science\\". He has called repeatedly for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials to prove the efficacy of flu vaccines, a position that most in the field hold as unethical. His views on flu vaccines are opposed by the medical establishment. On 5 July 2020, Jefferson claimed in an interview with The Telegraph that the COVID-19 coronavirus may not have originated in China.https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/the-coronavirus-may-not-have- originated-in-china-says-oxford-professor/ His theory was that a virus may simply lie dormant for years before suddenly emerging. As an example of this possibility, he pointed to the isolation of Western Samoa, which lost 22% of its population to Spanish flu in 1918, and claimed the islands had no contact with the outside world. However, it is well documented that Spanish flu arrived on board the SS Talune on 7 November, 1918, when six infected passengers from New Zealand were allowed ashore.https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/influenza-pandemic-hits- samoahttps://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/1918-influenza-pandemic/samoa Publications   References Category:British epidemiologists Category:20th-century births Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Cochrane Collaboration people ","title":"Tom Jefferson (epidemiologist)"},{"id":"44641127","text":"Desmia bifidalis is a moth in the family Crambidae.

He succeeded the twelve- year House veteran Dan Branch, who ran unsuccessfully in the May 27, 2014 runoff election for Attorney General of Texas but was defeated by then State Senator Ken Paxton. Branch endorsed Meyer as his successor in the House runoff election that year. Background From a family of six children, Meyer graduated in 1996 from Southern Methodist University in University Park, which he attended on a scholarship. He was an intern for former U.S. Representative Larry Combest of Texas's 19th congressional district, based about Lubbock. In 1999, he received his Juris Doctor degree from the Washington and Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Virginia. Meyer resides in University Park with his wife, the former Keana Bucher, and, as of 2014, their three children. He is a Sunday school teacher in the United Methodist Church. He is a past officer of the Greater Dallas Pachyderm Club, an organization which promotes the Republican Party. Legal and political life Meyer counsels for Wick Phillips in complex commercial litigation and appeals in the areas of oil and natural gas, telecommunications, intellectual property, consumer finance, banking, employment disputes, real estate, landlord/tenant issues, construction, equipment leasing, and bankruptcy proceedings. Since 2004, he has been repeatedly named by Thomson Reuters among Texas Super Lawyers and Rising Stars.\\" In his bid for the state House, Meyer on May 27, 2014 handily defeated private equity partner Chart Hampton Westcott (born 1985) of Dallas, his intraparty runoff opponent, 8,551 votes (74.4 percent) to 2,935 (25.6 percent. The campaign was heated and personal; in July, two months after the runoff voting, a flyer, signed by Dallas Cowboys football star Troy Aikman, was mistakenly mailed to voters asking for support for Westcott, who is affiliated with the conservative Traditional Values Coalition. Westcott apologized for the mistake and said that he fully endorsed Meyer in the general election despite their primary rivalry. In the general election on November 4, 2014, Meyer defeated Democrat Leigh Bailey, who is also a lawyer, 24,973 (60.7 percent) to 16,182 (39.3 percent). Meyer's District 108 includes Downtown Dallas, Uptown, Old East Dallas, Park Cities, Bluffview, and Preston Hollow. Meyer narrowly secured his third term in the House in the general election held on November 6, 2018, when Democrats ran strongly in Dallas County. With 39,427 votes (50.3 percent), he defeated Democrat Joanna Cattanach, who polled 39,207 ballots (49.7 percent).https://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist331_state.htm References Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Southern Methodist University alumni Category:Washington and Lee University School of Law alumni Category:Texas lawyers Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas Republicans Category:People from University Park, Texas Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American United Methodists Category:20th-century Methodists Category:21st-century Methodists ","title":"Morgan Meyer"},{"id":"44641221","text":"Desmia recurvalis is a moth in the family Crambidae.

She is specifically known to work with yarn, cardboard, and mirror fragments to create suspended mobiles. Some of her pieces are commissioned, and many are site-specific. She has been active though numerous solo exhibitions as well as group exhibitions since 1990. Notable for her unusual use of space, White's work has been featured in a range of non-exhibition spaces including the bookshop window at Galerie Buchholz and a children's learning area at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. A past exhibition from the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles included a set of Pae's mobiles that she created using colorful pieces of paper that were hung on multicolored strings. She often draws inspiration from nature and represents elements like fish, birds, and ponds in her works. She is known to observe the ordinary and often overlooked objects of everyday life and use them in her pieces. Her work is largely influenced by artists like Alexander Calder and Sister Corita. White created a non-mobile piece titled Smoke Knows in 2009 that consists of a large tapestry expressing her interpretation of photographs of smoke. At this time in her career, White drew inspiration from smoke throughout the creation of numerous pieces. One source states that the recurring use of the smoke motif through her works represents her fascination with the ordinary and allows for exploration of the curves and various shades found within its clouds. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art acquired this piece in 2010, and identifies that the tapestry is made of cotton and polyester. It is not on display at this time. Of the concept behind her work, White has said: > \\"For the last several years, my practice has focused on an exploration of > the neglected, the forgotten, the spaces between things, even the things > between things.

Boys and girls cartwheeling in D√ºsseldorf around 1900. The D√ºsseldorf's cartwheeler (Radschl√§ger in German) is the oldest tradition of D√ºsseldorf and became one of their famous landmarks. The symbol of the cartwheel is found on many souvenirs and various naming D√ºsseldorf again. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, in D√ºsseldorf's Burgplatz. Street maintenance hole cover in D√ºsseldorf, featuring two cartwheeling children.  Origin of the legend and history  The origin of the custom cannot be pinned down to a single historic event, but several stories have appeared around it. The best known version is the battle of Worringen. Adolf VIII, Count of Berg, defeated the Archbishop of Cologne in this battle in 1288. As a result of the victory, D√ºsseldorf received city rights. According to the story, the custom stems from the population and especially the children running for joy and making cartwheels on the streets . Another narrative style is about a wedding procession, in which the wedding carriage's wheel broke. To ward off the impending disaster, a boy jumped into a coach, and held the wheel. Whether the wedding was that of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or to the wedding of the Margravine Jakobea of Baden with Johann Wilhelm of J√ºlich- Cleves-Berg, is controversial. A further modification takes on these second wedding. The bride is supposed to have been very unhappy with her marriage, but the cartwheelers and their coach's skills would have made her laugh. Late 19th century and early 20th century, many travelers came to the city for major exhibitions -the forerunners of today's fairs. The children discovered that cartwheels was a lucrative source of income, as the incoming bourgeois paid them up to a penny for what they thought was a \\"local and patriotic\\" symbol. In 1945, after the war-evacuated Jan-Wellem monument was brought back to the city, not only torches and fanfare accompanied it, but also cartwheeling boys.  Cartwheels in D√ºsseldorf's cityscape  Cartwheelers are found in several fountains in the city. The best known is Radschl√§gerbrunnen (Cartwheeler Fountain) in the Burgplatz, created in 1954 by Alfred Zschorsch, with Hans M√ºller-Schl√∂sser's inscription \\"Radschl√§ger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\\" (\\"We want to keep being cartwheelers, no matter how crazy the world might be\\"). Even street maintenance hole covers and door knockers of Saint Lambertus Church, designed by Friedrich Becker, who also created the cartwheelers in front of the D√ºsseldorf's shopping mall Schadow-Arkaden. The tradition is notably kept alive by the Alde D√ºsseldorf civil society of 1920, who conducted the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971, it was held annually by boys and girls in June on the K√∂nigsallee, and since 2006 on the Rheinwerft below the old town and has become an integral part in the D√ºsseldorf event program. More than 500 boys and girls participate each year. One of the sculptures of the Radschl√§ger-Kunst project. In 2001, the project Radschl√§ger-Kunst (Cartwheeler-Art) started, consisting in the creation of over 100 cartwheeler sculptures by professional and amateur artists. The sculptures, which used Saint Lambertus Church door knockers as a starting model, are two meters high and wide and have a depth of 30 centimeters. They were distributed in the urban area and only a part was purchased at the end of the year from private individuals or companies.

He had a home and library at Huzirina, modern Tel Sultantepe, in Southern Turkey. He is famous for owning an extensive library where incantations, medical texts, prayers, epics, and wisdom literature were found. He began his career in about 701 BC as a junior apprentice scribe but eventually became chief temple administrator of the god Zababa. British excavators discovered 400 scholarly tablets and fragments in 1951, outside what they assume is his house, that were written or owned by Qurdi-Nergal and his descendants. They were protected by wine jars and were lying in a pile against the house's outside wall. The most recent date on the tablets was 619 BC, which was just a few years before the Assyrian empire collapsed and the nearby city of Harran was destroyed (610 BC).Robson, Eleanor (2008). Mathematics in Ancient Iraq: A Social History. Princeton University Press. p. 144‚Äì145. Some scholars believe that the Huzirina tablets are the remains of a scribal school run by Qurdi-Nergal and his descendants. According to the tablets found, other scribes such as Nabu-ah-iddin, his pupil Nabu-rehtu-usur, Sum-tabni-usur, Mutaqqin-Assur, Nabu-sumu-iskun, and at least another 15 junior apprentice scribe wrote or copied texts along with Qurdi-Nergal.Konig, Jason, and Katerina Oikonomopoulou, Greg Woolf (2013). Ancient Libraries. Cambridge University Press. p. 49-50. The tablets were produced by copying or dictation. This scribal school may have been funded by provincial officials and gives insights into the culture of the time. Most likely young teens worked as scribes hoping to eventually work in the royal court and had aspirations to work their way up in the ranks of imperial governance. The archaeological finds were probably quickly buried before the Medes and Babylonians destroyed Harran and its surrounding cities. Qurdi-Nergal had at least one son, Mushallim-Baba, and one great-grandson Ninurta, who lived in 619 BC.

Sullivan is an American film studio executive. He is known for his work as a technical director at CBS Cable as well as audio technician and cameraman. He also spent 10 years in Hollywood as the founder and chairman and CEO of American Film Location Co., Front Street Studios, Ambassador Studios and Queen of Angels Studios. He is currently the founder, chairman, and CEO of the for profit media company BaysideLiveTV in Bayside, New York, along with administrator on 6 local Facebook group, and the founder of two small (less than $25,000 a year) local non-profit organizations that relay on donations from community members to assist participants. BaysideLiveTV is not a charity, but a business where he is able to promote local business while also gaining revenue through sponsorship and monthly membership fees. Career Sullivan began his career in radio with NPR, formerly known as National Public Radio, and WBAI, part of the Pacifica Radio Network. He transitioned into television, working in New York City at WNYW Channel 5 before moving on to larger networks such as ABC and CBS. He spent 10 years with CBS, traveling the United States covering sports and working on 60 Minutes. During his time at CBS he also working on the soap operas Guiding Light and As the World Turns. His work in television in his early career gave him experience with both local and network news. Sullivan is originally from New York, but moved out to Los Angeles where he started his own film studio and also began to develop real estate. In Hollywood, he worked with movie companies such as Paramount Pictures, Disney, Warner Brothers, Universal, and Sony. He worked on more than 300 films during his career, including Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and Doc Hollywood. Sullivan made the news in 1991 with the announced closing of Queen of Angels Hospital in Hollywood. At the same time it was reported that the adjacent nursing home was in danger of closing along with the hospital. Sullivan arranged to open the hospital for filming, using nursing home residents as extras. The location was used for shows including Shannon's Deal, with the nursing home residents also earning money for their appearances. Sullivan's career in Hollywood expanded beyond that of film production. He is the founder and former chairman of the now defunct Association of Film Location Services, which worked in conjunction with the California Film Commission and the California Department of Commerce. During his time with the company, he oversaw the creation of its code of ethics and 32 private film location companies. Sullivan moved back to New York and lived in SoHo, Manhattan for approximately 10 years before moving to Bayside, Queens. During 2010, he took on a new role as the executive director of the Bayside Village Business Improvement District (BID). Initially he was the sole member to volunteered as the interim director to fill the vacancy, and he is then hired as the full-time director a short time later. Within two years, a feud with the organization's other leaders began, where he accuses them of mishandling BID's entire budget. Sullivan left BID before being fired executive director during the spring 2012 election. He spoke with Queens journalists in 2012 after losing the election, he then contested the results \\"accusing the BIG of four play in hindering his ability to achieve board member status.\\" At that time he also stated that he would focus on his business, BaysideLiveTV. By the Fall, Sullivan began BaysideLiveTV's Facebook page. Sullivan expanded BaysideLiveTV in 2014 with a new 3.0 version, in an attempt to mimic NY1's \\"micro market station\\" distribution, promoting that profits from the endeavor will be donated to the Bayside Historical Society, a promise that shows no merit in years since. Along with a local internet channel that highlights the northeast Queens neighborhood of Bayside, it is a membership based news service that provides local businesses with an opportunity for official advertising and news features. These programs are shown on the BaysideLiveTV sites, and also shown on six social media groups that BaysideLiveTV controls and advertises on its website. Used as a test market for similar stations, Sullivan assisted with the launch and development of the station which included allowing residents and businesses to create the content that is aired. He also launched a mobile application for the station. During 2015, the business worked on an unsuccessful GoFundMe for the company, it had a goal raising $50,000 to created series on ‚ÄúLiving Legends of Bayside\\" as well as new programs of small documentary broadcasts about local musicians and artists. The 2015 to 2017 \\"Living Legends of Bayside\\" series does a wonderful job of telling the stories of seven older white men in Bayside. Despite the existence of women and people of color in Bayside for hundreds of years, in May 2020, Susie Wong is the first woman and person of color whose biography is explored and shared on the platform. The expansion into social media allows Sullivan to regain control over the business district in the Bayside area, sharing information across platforms and selling his influence to sponsors by boosting of page visits, likes, members, and socio-economic status. Some of these pages were created by Sullivan and/or BaysideLive TV, others include a neighborhood Facebook page of which Sullivan has become a head administrator, dictating and steering discussions while promoting his BaysideLiveTV through media. These Facebook pages include: BaysideLiveTV, The Life and Times of Bayside, NY, Bayside, Queens, Bayside, Queens Group, Bell Blvd, and the Marie Curie 158 Alumni Association . The lack of transparency impacts the experience that users of these platforms have, where they are unknowingly the subject of a specific narrative promoted by BaysideLiveTV and its sponsors. is that community members of the Bayside, Queens Facebook group page are unaware of monetization of the posts, likes, and shares that the 22,000 members of the group to be the perfect audience. These members they are unable to speak freely about businesses on the platform, termed business bashing by the administrators, while being simultaneously advertised to and by Sullivan, BaysideLiveTV. This act of creating, and using existing, social media platforms to create a network of control where a business owner can control the narrative. This a well known tool that local business owners, and nonprofit leaders, use to gain sponsorship from larger corporations. In addition, the organization Friends of Bayside High School, is an independent non-profit organization that Sullivan helped to found with Dave Solano and Frank Skala in April of 2014, and where he is executive director. This independent nonprofit is unjustly publicized on Sullivan's company website under social media without notice of its independence from BaysideLiveTV. Further, Friends of Bayside High School's website and the BaysideLiveTV website both have the same false description of Sullivan's company, BaysideLiveTV, as is a philanthropic endeavor, stating: \\"Mr. Sullivan is also involved with many philanthropic enterprises from donating a neighborhood web tv channel to Bayside with BaysideLiveTV.com.\\" This is incorrect, as it is a business one created after his firing from Bayside Village Business Improvement District (BID). In 2015, Sullivan organized an interview for the BaysideLiveTV with Broadway show Dinner with the Boys, written by Dan Lauria and starring Ray Abruzzo and Richard Zavaglia. The cast toured the Bayside area and later appeared in an interview with Sullivan on his BaysideLiveTV.

Built in 1907 on a small island in Ambajejus Lake, it is the only surviving structure associated with the great logging drives that drove the economy of inland Maine for decades. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The building has been rehabilitated and can be visited by boat from various launch points on the lake. Description and history The boom house is a single-story wood frame structure, set on an island in the northwest corner of Ambajejus Lake, just south of where the West Branch Penobscot River enters the lake. It is about long and wide, and is divided into three sections. The central portion, which is the oldest part, has a gable roof with an attic area; the other two sections were likely added not long after the first section was built in 1907. The building is on a site where there has been a documented boom house since the 1830s, which was likely a facility mentioned by Henry David Thoreau in his writings about a trip to the area. The house is built at a strategic point in the movement of logs down river toward the paper mills of Millinocket. The island, along with a second one to the north, forms a choke point where a containment boom can be stretched across the river. The booms would be used to collect logs in large numbers, which would then be towed down the chain of lakes to North Twin Dam, where they would be released and sent further downriver. Log drives of this sort took place on the West Branch Penobscot until 1971.

It was one of the first Iraqi cities to fall out of the control of the Iraqi Government, and resulted in the Anbar Campaign.  Battle  On 30 December 2013, Iraqi forces dismantled a Sunni protest camp, which angered many people. Gunmen proceeded to attack deployed army patrols on the highway. On 2 January 2014, Al-Qaeda seized control of parts of the town, as well as nearby Ramadi. After the army withdrew from the area ISIS fighters and its allies entered both cities. Many videos showed ISIS forces clashing with police forces, and ISIS attacks and seizures on the main police station. 100 inmates were freed, weapons and ammunition were seized, and most police forces abandoned their posts. On January 3, the town was reportedly under the control of Sunni Rebels, but Iraq said the city remained contested. The rebels set police vehicles ablaze and brandished their weapons. The rebels raised their flag in Fallujah, took over all police stations, and military posts after security forces left the city. On January 4, the town was taken by Sunni Rebels and Al- Qaeda fighters. The Iraqi army shelled the city with mortars in an attempt to wrestle back the town, but resulted in the deaths of 8 people and wounded 30. 60% of the town was reported to be under rebel control. Much later, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki vowed to eliminate \\"all terrorist groups\\" in a statement on national television. The police chief of the Anbar said that Iraqi forces were in control of the outskirts of Fallujah, but the city itself was held by ISIS and its allies. Sunni tribesmen refused to let Iraqi forces into the city, but held negotiations with them. Iraqi forces proceeded to shell the city from a nearby military base, before eventually withdrawing.  Aftermath  Four months later, the War in Iraq of 2013 to 2017 escalated. Two years later, Iraqi Government recaptured the city.

Life  Teplitskaya was born on 4 September 1916, in C. Zhmerinka Vinnitsa region. She entered Kyiv Medical Institute, finishing in 1938. In December 1938, she began postgraduate study at the Department of Pathologic Physiology of the second Kyiv Medical Institute. She died in 1998 at age 82.  Career  = Military = From the first days of the Great Patriotic War (World War II) Teplitskaya went to the front. She was heavily injured during the defense of Kerch. She worked in the Kemerovo hospital (1942). She took part in the hostilities at the Leningrad front. She was a career surgeon in front line hospitals (1944). She served in the Far East (1945-1946 ). She was awarded the Great Patriotic War of II degree. After the war, from 1946‚Äì1948 years, she served in the Kyiv military garrison. = Research = After demobilization in September 1948, Teplitskaya worked in the Institute of Physiology laboratories as a senior researcher. She started her dissertation on the theme: \\"Fatigue and recovery processes in groups of small muscles activity\\". She received her scientific degree of Candidate of Medical Sciences from the Lviv State Medical Institute in 1953. Her primary research was devoted to human activity. She studied fatigue and the restorative influence of rest in the context of various types of manual labor (typing, playing piano, work at a confectionery factory). She concluded that restoration of the ability after a work day had a wavy character and depends on the complexity and diversity of movement. Successfully defending her thesis in March 1954, she worked on higher nervous activity of the P. Pavlova psychiatric hospital while teaching at the department of psychopathology and —Åorrectional institute named. M. Gorkogo. She studied questions of formation and dynamics of purposeful movements. Describing the process of practical activity of mentally retarded students, she drew attention to lack of coordination of their movements as a specific feature of their motor areas. She highlighted four development stages: motor skills, pace and rhythm; purposeful actions and dynamics of coordination of movements. Another important topic was psychopathology and psychiatry, in particular research on schizophrenia. The author observed much higher nervous activity in such patients, studied the conscious and subconscious, neurochemical processes, mechanisms of \\"–µ—Ç—ñ–æ–ø–∞—Ç–æ–≥–µ–Ω–µ–∑\\" schizophrenia, principles of social adaptation, verbal reaction, dissociative manifestations, behavior, adaptation/re-adaptation and the speed of behavioral reactions and pathological changes from schizophrenia. Her thesis was on the Settings of the time of motion and verbal reactions in experimental schizophrenia survey. She consulted for professor V. M. Banshchyrov and E. I. Boyko. She studied the views of other psychiatrists, including P. B. Hannushkina, E. Krepelina, S. Kosakova and V. P. Serbian. Hannushkin created a psychiatric school, experimentally studied hypnosis, analyzed psychoanalytic ideas and developed a doctrine of pathological character and psychopathic personality. Hannushkin believed in psychopathic personality, finding it distinct from healthy personalities and characterized by an inborn character and consistency of movement. She presented \\"Some experimental–µ confirmation of P.B. Hannushkins views on psychopathic personality\\", at a 1975 scientific conference, devoted to his 100th anniversary. She published some 50 papers on the problems of mental retardation and other pathologies. In particular, she studied the higher nervous activity of mentally retarded children, development of their nervous activity and the influence of emotion on mentally retarded children. Telitskoi contributed to the methodology of teaching children with psychophysical development issues, as well as upgrades to correction-rehabilitation educational process in auxiliary schools. She also worked on defectological science. She taught a course on \\"Fundamentals of defectology\\". M.O. Suprun, referred to her strong impression on her students. = Teacher = In 1967 Teplitskaya switched to a teaching position at the department and —Åorrectional faculty and taught psychological and pedagogical disciplines including —Åorrectional, physiology, psychological and pedagogical diagnostics and pathological anatomy. She taught material from S. D. Zabraman, I. Shvancara, B. V. Zejgarnyka, A. Beene, A. Anastazee and S. Freud. She spoke fluent English, and was able to incorporate English material in its original language. = Author = Teplitskaya published textbooks. In 1963 she published A brief guide to practical lessons and demonstrations of the course of Pathologic Anatomy, which contributed to students' practical research skills in pathophysiological and morphological processes, pathogenesis, as well as clinical disease manifestations. She coauthored a guide for students Labor studies in secondary school.  Bibliography (partial)  * Processes of fatigue and recovery work group of small muscles: dis. on soisk. uch. step. cand. honey.

The southern terminus is at Artesia Road, and travels near the Golden Triangle Regional Airport. The highway continues to its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 82. The road was constructed in 1998, and was designated MS 791 in 2008. Route description All of the route is located in Lowndes County. In 2013, Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated as many as 4,200 vehicles traveling north of the entrance to the airport. MS 791 is not included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The route is not legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and is maintained by MDOT. MS 791 starts at Artesia Road, near the unincorporated community of Billups. The divided highway then travels north along the small area of grassland. About later, MS 791 intersects a road leading to a factory and soon meets the entrance to the airport terminal. The highway continues north to Industrial Park Road, where MS 789 ends. Just past Charlie D. Ford Drive, MS 791 shifts slightly to its east, intersecting MS 182. It then continues to its northern terminus of US 82 at a diamond interchange. The road shortly ends at North Frontage Road.

The road became designated as MS 791 in 2008, the same time as MS 789. MS 791 was rerouted slightly and became a divided highway by 2010.

It was later included as part of his first published book, The Opener of the Way (1945), and his 1994 collection The Early Fears. A Cthulhu Mythos tale, it introduced the forbidden tome De Vermis Mysteriis (Mysteries of the Worm). Later on in 1935, Lovecraft wrote the short story \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\" as a sequel and dedicated it to Bloch. Eventually, in 1950, Bloch wrote his own sequel \\"The Shadow from the Steeple\\". Plot summary The story focuses on a nameless narrator who, in addition to being a college student, hopes to make a living as a pulp writer of weird fiction. His earliest efforts at the craft are woefully inadequate and rejected by magazine editors. As a result, he begins to yearn after the forbidden knowledge known only to those who are true practitioners of the occult, and begins sending letters of correspondence to various thinkers and dreamers from all over the country. One man in particular, a \\"mystic dreamer\\" from New England, tells him of the existence of certain nameless and forbidden tomes such as the Necronomicon and Book of Eibon. Soon afterwards, the narrator mails letters to various libraries, universities, and occult practitioners, hoping to secure the desired volumes. However, he is only met with both hostility and threats of violence. Undeterred, he then personally begins searching various bookstores around his hometown. At first, he again meets with disappointment, but his perseverance eventually pays off and, in an old shop on South Dearborn Street, he succeeds in obtaining an occult volume known as De Vermis Mysteriis, which he knows was written by a Belgian sorcerer named Ludvig Prinn, who was burned at the stake during the witchcraft trials. Finding it to be written entirely in Latin, and not being able to speak the language, he once again contacts the New England mystic, who agrees to aid him in translation. The narrator travels to his home in Providence, Rhode Island, where the mystic is initially hesitant to even open the volume, but eventually does so upon the narrator's insistence. While perusing the book, the mystic inadvertently stumbles across a spell or invocation on a chapter dealing with familiars which he believes to be a summoning towards one of the invisible \\"star-sent servants\\" spoken of in the frightful stories surrounding Prinn. Foolishly, the narrator makes no attempt to stop the mystic from reading the inscription out loud, and immediately afterwards, the room turns dreadfully cold, and an unearthly wind rushes in through the window, followed by a hideous laughter, which heralds the arrival of an invisible vampiric monstrosity: a star vampire. Suddenly, the monster lifts the mystic into the air, and begins feeding off of his blood until he is nothing more than a wrinkled, flabby corpse. As the creature continues to feed, it slowly becomes more and more visible until its monstrous form is fully revealed. Upon witnessing the fully visible \\"shambler from the stars,\\" the narrator goes mad. After the creature retreats back into the nameless cosmic gulfs from whence it had come, the book mysteriously vanishes and the narrator wanders out into the streets, shortly after setting his own friend's house on fire. While the narrator struggles to move on from his ordeal, he still subconsciously fears that the shambler from the stars will one day return for him.

Lawsuits The Federal Public Ministry (MPF) in Amap√° accused Sambazon and its CEO for exploiting the genetic heritage of a√ßa√≠ without the authorization of the Management and Genetic Heritage Council (Cgen). Judicially, the MPF issued a fine of more than R $ 70 million in compensation for material damages to the environment and collective moral damages. The MPF also has ordered the company to stop using Brazilian a√ßa√≠ in its products until it obtains regular registration with Cgen. In addition to illegal access to a√ßa√≠, it was also confirmed that the companies of the Sambazon Group failed to share the benefits resulting from the use of the Brazilian genetic heritage, violating national and international standards that deal with the issue. According to a representation from the Rio Baiano Intercommunity Development Association (Asdicorb) to the Attorney's Office in Par√°, in 2008, the company Sambazon sought out people from the community and nearby areas with the proposal of ‚Äúsocially fair and environmentally sustainable‚Äù marketing.

The system has four primary components: two tethered aerostats which utilize a helium/air mix, armored mooring stations, sophisticated radars, and a processing station designed to communicate with anti-missile and other ground and airborne systems. Each system is referred to as an \\"orbit\\", and two orbits have been built. The Army-led joint program is designed to complement fixed-wing surveillance aircraft, saving money on crew, fuel, maintenance and other costs, and give military commanders advance warning to make decisions and provide notifications. The program was suspended in October 2015. Background In January 1996, the office of the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to establish an Aerostat Joint Project Office based in Huntsville, Alabama. The office involved all military departments‚Äîthe Army would serve as program manager, while the Navy and Air Force would provide deputy program managers. Following approval of the JLENS acquisition strategy, the project office conducted design concept and risk-reduction studies. In June 1997, the project office issued a request for proposal for an early JLENS prototype. The initial program had three objectives: (1) to mitigate risks during development and acquisition; (2) to design, develop, procure, fabricate, integrate, test, demonstrate and maintain a system which met military requirements; and (3) to provide an operational prototype which could potentially be used during a deployment of troops. Three bids were received, and in January 1998 a joint venture between Hughes Aircraft and Raytheon, located in El Segundo, California, won the initial contract‚Äîvalued at $11.9 million‚Äîas part of an estimated $292 million contract if all options were exercised. Since that time, numerous studies and requirements changes have been made. According to JLENS' product manager, the system was poised for operational testing, a planned three-year deployment at Aberdeen Proving Ground; if successful, full deployment would be the next step. Design, operation and costs The system features two tethered aerostats, roughly in length, that float to an altitude of for up to 30 days at a time. Each aerostat utilizes a different radar system‚Äîone has a VHF-band surveillance radar and the other an X-band fire-control radar. JLENS is designed to provide 24/7, 360-degree coverage extending . The surveillance radar scans in all directions to pick up targets, then the targeting radar looks only in a certain segment to guide weapons to it. Its detection capability seeks to equal 4‚Äì5 fixed-wing aircraft, and is designed to operate at 15‚Äì20 percent of the cost of fixed-wing aircraft.Army Readies JLENS Surveillance Aerostat ‚Äì Defensetech.org, 23 June 2014 The tethered cables relay data and provide power. As threats are detected, information is sent to anti-missile and other fire-control systems including Patriot, Standard Missile 6, AIM-120 AMRAAM, and the Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System. Its relatively low- power usage and over-the-horizon capability makes it less expensive to operate than existing fixed-wing systems and provides significantly greater range than ground-based systems. JLENS aerostats are filled with 590,000 cubic feet (17,000 cubic m) of non-flammable helium. Given its operational altitude, the internal pressure of JLENS is about the same as the exterior pressure, which makes the system difficult to shoot down. Airships can absorb multiple punctures before they lose altitude. When they do, they would come down so slowly that they could be reeled in, easily repaired, and quickly redeployed. Mooring stations for large systems would be relatively permanent; however, for short- or medium-range surveillance, the aerostats would likely be smaller and their mooring systems mobile. In addition to protecting U.S. cities, the system could be deployed anywhere commanders cite a need for increased missile defense capability, such as on the Korean Peninsula. In 2012, the JLENS program experienced a Nunn-McCurdy cost breach due to budget cuts for unit procurements. Under Secretary of Defense Frank Kendall reviewed the program and directed the Army to continue with a reduced test plan using the two existing JLENS developmental orbits and prepare for operational testing at Aberdeen. Two years later, in March 2014, a report by the Government Accountability Office concluded that $2.78 billion had been invested in system design, development and other costs. Following incidents with the JLENS aerostats, some retired military officials suggested that the system's sophisticated sensors be moved to more reliable platforms like satellites or long-endurance UAVs to fulfill the role of detecting low-flying cruise missiles.JLENS Supporters: Never Mind the Blimp, Save the Radar - Defenseone.com, 5 December 2015 Testing Since the program's inception, extensive testing has been conducted on the JLENS system. For example, in September 2005 the program successfully completed a two-day functional review, which examined fire-control radar, surveillance radar, processing station, communication system and platform. In 2012, tests were conducted December 6‚Äì7 at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The system tracked four threats similar to tactical ballistic missiles, and it met its primary and secondary goals, including launch point estimation, ballistic tracking and discrimination performance. A 2012 report by the Pentagon's operational testing office found JLENS deficient in four ‚Äúcritical performance areas‚Äù and rated its overall reliability as ‚Äúpoor.‚Äù A year later, Pentagon technical specialists, in their most recent assessment of the system, said JLENS ‚Äúdid not demonstrate the ability to survive in its intended operational environment.‚Äù In January 2013, Raytheon conducted a field trial of the JLENS equipped with its multi-spectral targeting system-B (MTS-B) to observe simulated terrorists planting an improvised explosive device (IED) in real- time. The electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor successfully tracked ground targets, even under smoky conditions from a recent forest fire. Imagery captured by the MTS-B was passed through the JLENS tether for operators to view a live feed from dozens of miles away, simultaneously tracking ground targets using its integrated radar system, demonstrating the potential for integration of JLENS radar and EO/IR payloads.Raytheon's MTS-B system demonstrates surface target observation capabilities - Army-Technology.com, 15 January 2013Raytheon MTS-B Multi-Spectral Targeting System on JLENS Aerostat Tracks Moving Targets - UASvision.com, 18 January 2013 In 2013, the Army, utilizing its own soldiers, put the system through a series of demanding drills during a period referred to as early user testing. Previously, contractor employees had been the system's primary operators. Following the six-week successful trials held at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, the Army took formal control of the system. In October 2014, lab tests demonstrated that data collected by the JLENS radar system could be converted into a format for use by NORAD's command and control systems. Deployment A three-year exercise for one of the two JLENS orbits was slated to begin in early 2015 at Aberdeen Proving Ground north of Baltimore, Maryland, contingent upon federal funding. The president's 2015 budget request included $54 million for JLENS. The U.S. House of Representatives cut funding in half, while the Senate fully funded JLENS. One analyst noted that \\"failure to pass a defense spending bill by March 2015 would impact JLENS at Aberdeen.\\" The deployment joined an ongoing exercise known as Operation Noble Eagle, with JLENS casting an aerial net from Boston to Lake Erie to Raleigh, North Carolina, with a particular eye toward detecting threats approaching the nation's capital. The system was able to detect ground-based vehicles up to 140 miles away, from Richmond, Virginia to Cumberland, Maryland to Staten Island, New York. The program's second orbit was kept in strategic reserve for potential future deployment. The JLENS program was funded through achieving Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and low-rate production, which were expected around 2017 as scheduled, however only the two test model systems were put into operational service.JLENS Will Be Produced, but Not in Numbers Once Expected - Forecastinternational.com, 10 October 2016 Privacy, weaponization, and weather concerns Privacy advocates raised concerns that the deployment could be used to track individuals by generating radar geo-location data and correlating it with other technology, including cellphone metadata and traffic cameras. A spokesperson for the Army stated that \\"absolutely, 100 percent\\" that JLENS will not have video cameras, nor will it collect personally identifiable information. ‚ÄúThe primary mission...is to track airborne objects,‚Äù the Army said. ‚ÄúIts secondary mission is to track surface moving objects such as vehicles or boats. The capability to track surface objects does not extend to individual people.\\" Experts cite the extreme angles from overhead as precluding even advanced surveillance systems from being able to identify faces or other features such as license plates, though anonymized geolocation data has been found to easily identify specific individuals. Privacy groups raised concerns that advanced sensors such as ARGUS, MTS-B and other Wide Area Persistent Surveillance EO/IR payloads may be deployed, as Federal privacy regulations currently do not apply and the Army has refused to conduct a privacy impact assessment. One privacy group has also claimed that JLENS could be weaponized and that it is capable of carrying Hellfire missiles. However, the manufacturer claims that JLENS does not have any weapons and that it has the capacity to detect, not carry, Hellfire missiles. The JLENS system is designed to stay aloft and survive most weather patterns. According to the system's manufacturer, JLENS has survived 106 mph winds. Incidents In the fall of 2010, a JLENS prototype was destroyed when another airship crashed into it after becoming unmoored during severe weather. On October 28, 2015, one of two JLENS aerostats being used to conduct a test over Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, became untethered. It was escorted by two fighter jets as it drifted at an altitude of approximately 16,000 feet towards Pennsylvania. Matthew Hay Brown and Ian Duncan,\\"JLENS blimp has come free of its tether at APG, now floating over Pennsylvania; fighter jets monitoring,\\"The Baltimore Sun, 28 October 2015.Retrieved 28 October 2015 About three hours later, it was reported by NORAD to be approaching the ground near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles north of Aberdeen. Its dragging tether reportedly downed many power lines in the area, with loss of electrical power to as many as 20,000 area residents. The Pennsylvania State Police reported less than an hour later that the aerostat was \\"contained\\". It was found tangled in trees in Anthony Township, Pennsylvania. The Pentagon suspended trials of the system after the incident until the Army completed its investigation of how the aerostat broke free.Pentagon suspends troubled missile defense system at center of 'runaway blimp' - LAtimes.com, 3 November 2015 The program was said to be \\"hanging by a thread\\" after the incident. By February 2016, the investigation had found that a malfunctioning pressure sensing device caused a loss of air pressure in the tail fins, leading to the loss of aerodynamic efficiency which, along with increased wind drag, exacerbated tension on the tether to the point of breakage.

The incidents occurred near Mizpah Creek, a tributary of the Powder River, in Montana Territory.  Background  During the Northern Cheyenne Exodus in January, 1879, Black Coyote, his wife Buffalo Calf Road Woman (she is famously known for saving her brother in the Battle of Rosebud, which was the reason why the Cheyennes called it \\"The battle where the girl saved her brother\\"), their two small children, his brother-in-law Whetstone, Hole in the Breast, and other members of his family were part of Little Wolf's band of Northern Cheyenne who were traveling north to the Powder River Country. Black Coyote stole some horses with U.S. army brands, and one of the chief's named Black Crane told him to return the horses for the safety of the group. Black Coyote opposed this, and when Black Crane raised his whip, Black Coyote shot and killed him. Because of this, he and his family, totaling eight people were banished from the tribe.  The incidents  On Saturday, April 5, 1879 in present-day Powder River or Custer County, Montana, near the crossing of Mizpah Creek by the Fort Keogh to Deadwood telegraph line, Sergeant Kennedy of the U.S. Signal Corps, and Private Leo Baader of Company E, 2nd U.S. Cavalry were repairing the line, when Black Coyote's party found and attacked them. The warriors killed Private Baader, severely wounded Sergeant Kennedy, and captured the two men's horses. The wounded Sergeant crawled into a bush, and drove off the warriors with his revolver, but not before Black Coyote took Baader's carbine and watch. Kennedy was later rescued after a great loss of blood by three civilians traveling from Deadwood, South Dakota, including a Mr. O'Neil, who helped him about northwest to Fort Keogh. After learning details of the event, on April 8, 1879 Colonel Nelson A. Miles, the commander of Fort Keogh, ordered out Sergeant Thaddeus B. Glover with a small detachment of ten soldiers of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry to locate and arrest the warriors responsible. A small detachment from Fort Ellis consisting of men from Company D, 2nd Cavalry under Captain Thomas J. Gregg also traveled in pursuit of the Lakota band. On April 10, 1879 Glover's men caught up with the Cheyenne's trail, and deployed to advance. Two of the Cheyenne warriors signaled a white flag and willingly surrendered to Glover's detachment, before the remaining warrior fired on the cavalrymen. The soldiers then forced the three warrior's surrender without taking any casualties, and captured the five women and children. Black Coyote had with him articles of clothing and the watch taken from the body of Private Baader on April 5. The eight captured Cheyenne were then brought back to Fort Keogh. As the case was adjudged to be a civil one, the three warriors involved were housed in the Custer County jail at Miles City. During their imprisonment, Buffalo Calf Road Women, the wife of Black Coyote died of Diphtheria in Miles City. When Black Coyote learned of this, he became crazy and did not eat or sleep. From May 27,-June 4, 1879, their case was heard in the first territorial court held in Montana Territory east of Bozeman. Present as a reporter for The New York Times was Thompson R. McElrath who on June 8, 1879 wrote a lengthy letter describing the trial. The verdict of June 4, was for the three warriors to be executed by hanging on July 7, 1879, but the next morning, June 5, two hanged themselves in the jail at Miles City, Montana Territory. Later, the third Cheyenne also hanged himself in the jail. The action of April 10, 1879, as recalled by Sergeant T. B. Glover:  Medal of honor  One Congressional Medal of Honor was awarded for actions during the incident. It was for: * Sergeant Thaddeus B. Glover, Company B, 2nd United States Cavalry Regiment.

To date, this method has been used in 29 nations allowing over 6 million people to develop basic literacy. The program was originally developed in Spanish and known as Yo, s√≠ puedo. It has now been translated into many languages including Portuguese, English, Quechua, Aymara, Creole and Swahili. The Yes I Can literacy method uses pre-recorded lessons on video or DVD that are delivered by a local facilitator. Yes I Can also uses an alphanumeric association between numbers and letters. The program consists of the following teaching materials: the student booklet, a facilitator manual and 17 videos or DVDs which present recordings of 65 classes with actors taking the parts of teachers and students. These materials are implemented by a team of local facilitators who are trained and supported by technical advisers. The process consists of three stages: a preliminary period of socialization and training, the actual lesson blocks in which literacy is taught and a third stage known as post-literacy. The program is also available in braille for the blind, and for deaf people, and for people with mild intellectual problems.M√©todo de alfabetizaci√≥n \\"Yo, s√≠ puedo\\" Other programs are linked to Yes I Can, including Yo, s√≠ puedo seguir or Yes I Can Continue, which aims to consolidate and develop the basic literacy skills participants learn in the Yes I Can program.  History  Yes I Can emerges from a strong tradition of literacy education that has existed in Cuba since the 1961 Cuban Literacy Campaign. The 1961 Campaign reduced the illiteracy rate in Cuba from 23.6% to 3.9%. Since that time Cuban educators worked in many countries to help develop adult literacy prior to the development of Yes I Can, notably in Angola and Nicaragua. It was on the basis of such examples of Cuban educational aid that in 1995 the African country of Niger requested Cuban assistance to combat illiteracy. Due to a very high illiteracy rate (over 50%) and the difficulties of addressing this entirely through face to face teaching Cuba proposed a program delivered by radio however the President of Niger Ibrahim Bar√© Ma√Ønassara was killed in a coup d'√©tat before the new approach could be implemented in Niger and it was instead trialled in Haiti and Nicaragua. Following this Dr Leonela Relys Diaz and other educators at Latin American and Caribbean Pedagogical Institute (IPLAC) developed a similar program utilising TV.  The lessons  Yes I Can classes are delivered using a combination of distance education and community participation. The classes are convened by a local facilitator. The classes are organized around a discussion topic, which introduces a key letter or word for the lesson. The facilitator uses a series of pre-recorded classes usually on DVD and the accompanying workbook as the basis of the literacy class. The DVD depicts a small literacy class in which the teacher explains the lesson and exercises in the workbook and the students ask questions and make comments. The facilitator can stop and start the DVD- class, to allow their students to complete the exercises, discuss particular points, or repeat sections if required. In some cases economic and technical problems prevent the use of the DVD lessons which can cause inconsistencies in how the program is implemented. There is an introductory block of lessons designed for people with no prior experience of reading and writing which include exercises to practise holding a pen and forming simple shapes. In cases where participants already have some literacy experience these lessons can be skipped. In later classes students work with more complex blocks of text and learn other skills such as how to fill out forms with basic personal data. Students are considered to have successfully completed the program when they have produced a simple letter to a friend including description and opinion. The local facilitator works as the link between the virtual class of students in the audiovisual recording and the real participants. A 2006 UNESCO review of Yes I Can notes, \\"The role of facilitators has received both recognition and criticism\\". The report notes their strong social commitment, but notes problems in terms of the consistency of teaching skills amongst relatively untrained people.  Alphanumeric method  The alphanumeric approach uses knowledge of numbers to develop a knowledge of letters. This was introduced to the program on the suggestion of Dr Fidel Castro and based on the understanding that numbers are more familiar in everyday life to people who are illiterate. The vowels a, e, i, o, u are associated with the numbers 1-5 and the consonants are associated with numbers roughly in correspondence to their frequency of use. Many illiterate people in Cuba were able to deal effectively with money and quantities, an education that they got on the streets. Linking literacy with numbers and money is one of the reasons it has been so successful. This aspect of the program has, however, been criticised on the grounds that the introduction of letters combined with numbers overwhelms the non-literate person. This criticism failed to take account of the fact that many illiterate people are numerate with regards to money and tradeable quantities.  Community wide approach  Within the Yes I Can method low literacy is not understood as an individual issue but rather as a social issue that requires a community wide approach. This process is referred to as socialization and involves mobilising as many people as possible to take part in the campaign in a variety of roles. This process aims to develop a community wide understanding of the links between literacy and wider social and economic development goals. In relation to this aspect of the campaign UNESCO has noted that Yes I Can, \\"is in fact more than a method. It would be more appropriate to understand it as a literacy training model that goes beyond processes, materials, strategies etc., as it includes, both explicitly and implicitly, concepts of literacy training, learning, life skills and social mobilization, and involves a wide range of actors with varied roles from the beneficiaries of the literacy training to other stakeholders such as state entities and other concerned institutions\\".  Developing and maintaining literate communities  Yes I Can allows students to develop their reading and writing skills at an intelligent but basic level. However the program does not claim to establish a level of literacy that is self- sustaining without additional attention. Consequently, a third phase of the campaign, known as the 'post-literacy' phase (Yo, s√≠ puedo seguir) provides opportunities for graduates to undertake activities that consolidate and extend their new literacy. These may take the form of ongoing courses, employment or becoming a facilitator for a new intake of students.  Achievements and prospects  In 2006 the UNESCO King Sejong Literacy Prize was awarded to IPLAC for its work in developing and promoting the Yes I Can program. In 2012, it also received the \\"Mestres 68\\" Prize. Cuba has offered this method to the international community and has suggested that with its implementation illiteracy could be eradicated globally within 10 years and at a cost of just $1.5 billion. Yes I Can has been implemented in a number of linguistic and cultural contexts including the following: = Venezuela = In Venezuela, Yes I Can was implemented as part of Mission Robinson, a broader program of popular education initiated by the government of Hugo Ch√°vez. Between 2003 and 2005 1.5 million Venezuelans completed the program and in 2005 Venezuela was declared an Illiteracy Free Territory. The post-literacy phase was also strongly supported in Venezuela with Mission Robinson II providing access to primary education and Mission Robinson III providing access to reading circles across the country to allow the newly literate to consolidate and develop their skills. = East Timor = Yes I Can has been used in East Timor in a national campaign which began in 2006 with the arrival of 12 Cuban literacy advisors. By the end of 2007, literacy classes had commenced in over 400 local government areas of the country. Although initially delivered in Portuguese, new materials were later designed in Tetum, the most widely spoken of Timor's many languages. The program became known by its Tetum name, Los Hau Bele. The campaign mobilised over 200,000 people to participate in classes, and a workforce of over 600 local literacy facilitators and community organizers, who were trained by the Cuban advisors. The campaign ended in December 2012, by which time every one of East Timor's thirteen districts had been declared free of illiteracy. = Australia = In 2012 a formal licence agreement with Cuba enabled the first pilot project of Yes I Can to be initiated in Australia. The campaign was first implemented in Wilcannia, in far-western New South Wales and has since expanded to Bourke and Enngonia with plans for further expansion in 2015. The pilot was initiated by the National Aboriginal Adult Literacy Campaign Steering Committee and managed by the University of New England in partnership with Wilcannia Local Aboriginal Land Council. The Literacy for Life Foundation is a partnership between key agencies and individuals involved in the campaign. = Aotearoa New Zealand = Yes I Can methodology was used in Aotearoa, New Zealand in the Greenlight program implemented between 2003 and 2007 through the MƒÅori-led tertiary institution Te WƒÅnanga o Aotearoa. Cuban educators worked with their counterparts in Aotearoa New Zealand in a diagnostic stage which resulted in the development of a new program, Greenlight Learning for Life. Greenlight, consisted of 4 modules which were designed to take students from level 1 to level 3 on the NZ framework ‚Äì essentially to university entrance standard. Traditional Maori pedagogy and identity were emphasised in the development of materials. = Other locations = A version of Yes I Can has been implemented since 2007 in Uruguay and enjoyed widespread success. Since 2007, in Guatemala almost 20,000 people have learned to read and write using the program. In Angola over 300 000 people have benefited from the campaign. Yes I Can is also being implemented in the city of Seville which is the first experience with the Cuban method in Europe. The Latino Alliance for Literacy Advancement de New Mexico plans to implement the Yes I Can campaign in 4 pilot sites in the US state of New Mexico in 2015.

It was designed by Robin Dods and built in 1911 for Llewellyn Stephens. It is also known as Wewak. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.  History  Kitawah is a substantial timber residence constructed in 1911 for Brisbane solicitor Llewellyn Stephens and designed by prominent Queensland architect Robin Dods (of Hall and Dods). Kitawah is located upon a large block in East Brisbane that was originally part of Eastern Suburban Allotment 82, an area of , initially acquired by William Wilson in December 1853. Stephens purchased subdivision \\"H\\", on the corner of Barker Street and Heath Street in 1909 and commissioned Dods to design a home for his young family. Stephens was the eleventh child of Thomas Blacket Stephens, a well-known figure in early Brisbane. Amongst other achievements, Thomas Blacket Stephens was the second Mayor of Brisbane, a Member of the Legislative Council, Colonial Treasurer, Secretary of Public Lands and proprietor of the Brisbane Courier. Llewellyn Stephens was born at the family home Cumbooqepa (the predecessor to the Cumbooquepa now part of Somerville House) in South Brisbane in 1873, just four years before his father died. He went on to become a solicitor and an Alderman in South Brisbane and established his own firm Stephens and Tozer which still exists in Brisbane today. Stephens married Gladys Ryan in 1905 and they lived at another house designed by Dods at 622 Vulture Street, East Brisbane until Kitawah was completed in 1911. They had two children at this stage and went on to have another four who were all born at Kitawah. Family members recall a quiet, family-oriented homelife. The children played games in the garden with neighbouring children and had a number of ponies, Gladys held a monthly \\"at home\\" when visitors came to call. The house was extended sometime between 1915 and 1919. As Dods had moved to Sydney in 1913, the nature of his involvement in the design of the extension is not clear. A wing was added to the north- west corner to accommodate bedroom space for the boys, substantially altering the roof-form and appearance of the house from Heath Street. Prior to the extension, the house had verandahs on the western, southern and eastern sides and the massive crippled hipped roof presented an asymmetric front to the street. This asymmetry was maintained with the extension, adding another steep hip whose ridge was at a higher level than the hip on the western side. A gable roof was inserted into the central part of the roof and a decorative screen mounted upon the gable end became a central feature of this elevation. The front stairs were re-aligned to be centered with the new size of the verandah and as a consequence, no longer align with the front door. Kitawah is a late example of Robin Dods' work in Brisbane, as the following year he moved to Sydney, where he did not have the same opportunity to undertake large domestic commissions. Dods was an exceptionally talented and original architect, introducing to Queensland the \\"formal and philosophical ideas of both the British Arts and Crafts movement and Edwardian classicism\\". At the same time, he refined and re-worked common elements of traditional Queensland houses and methods of construction and his houses exhibited a common-sense and often innovative approach to designing for the sub-tropical climate. Dods produced an impressive and high quality body of work in Queensland including hospital, commercial and ecclesiastical buildings as well as many residences. In the domestic realm his approach was widely imitated, in particular his planning and detailing of verandahs, external stairs, ventilated roofs and gable decorations. Gladys Stephens continued to live at Kitawah after Llewellyn died in 1934. In 1936 a section of the block on the western side was sub-divided and sold and a further two roods, eight perches sub-divided into four blocks at the back of the block to the north was sold in 1938. Then in 1943 the Stephens family sold the house to the Parer family. The Parers renamed the house Wewak after one of their plantations in Papua New Guinea. The Parers further sub-divided the block in 1951, creating three blocks and one block, leaving Kitawah on a block with an area of . In 1969, the house was sold to Dr James Hemsley and the name of the house reverted to Kitawah. The property was sold in April 2012.  Description  Residence and front lawn, 2015 Kitawah is a large and imposing timber house, high-set on stumps with extensive verandahs and a massive hipped roof covered with Marseilles pattern terracotta tiles. The house has two tall masonry chimneys with high level openings and a skirt of timber battens infilling the spaces between the posts. Much of the garden setting is intact, Kitawah is located at the back of the large block with driveways to both sides. The front of the block is a large levelled and grassed area that was formerly a tennis court. The entry staircase is a prominent feature of this elevation, along with a large weatherboard gable with a bold decorative screen in the plane of the bargeboards. Stairs from two sides arrive on a central landing and then a single stair leads to the front verandah, the landing is covered with a simple timber pergola and post and beam-style timber \\"arches\\" mark the bottom of the staircases. The verandahs of the house are characterised by substantial timber posts and a simple balustrade. At the north-eastern corner of the house the verandah enlarges to become a semi-enclosed room of generous proportions, with large vertical timber louvres infilling the space between the roof and the balustrade. A set of stairs leads into the back garden from this room on the southern side. The planning and spatial arrangement of the house is complex, revolving around a number of axes with interlocking rooms of various ceiling heights. A long central hall runs through the house from a small vestibule just inside the front door. Three large bedrooms are located on the eastern side of the hall and are connected to a north-facing verandah which in turn, leads to the outdoor room on the north-eastern corner. Major public rooms are found on the western side of the hall. The dining room and drawing room are linked by a wide opening with sliding timber doors. The dining room is the larger of the two rooms and has a large, dark brick, arched fireplace. The drawing room has an alcove located on the north side and has windows on two sides, not unlike an enlarged window seat but square in plan. All of these rooms are lined with timber vee-jay boarding and are stained up to the picture rail to simulate the richness of panelling. Bedrooms, hall and public rooms are all carpeted. The north-western corner of the house has now been enclosed with fibro-cement sheeting to form two large rooms, which are semi self- contained with basic bathroom facilities. A secondary axis is formed on the western side of these rooms by a series of doors that link the kitchen to the dining room, drawing room and on to the front verandah. The back section of the house revolves around the large space of a well-proportioned back hall. The kitchen, bathroom, extra bedroom or study, former servant's room and back stairs all lead off this central space. The kitchen is located to the back of the dining room and has a large fireplace that is back-to-back with the fireplace of the dining room. A large walk-in pantry is located on the north- western corner of the kitchen. The kitchen, bathroom and toilet have recent fittings. The former servant's room is located up a short set of stairs adjacent to the back stairs. A broad set of stairs with very wide timber treads leads into the wash house area on the ground floor. This area is distinctive of many of Dods' domestic designs with the hipped roof extending down to enclose a high, airy space accommodating a range of \\"back of house\\" functions in a semi-open space. This area is used as a laundry and wine cellar and contains the copper and a fireplace.  Heritage listing  Kitawah was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Kitawah, constructed in 1912, is important in demonstrating the continued growth and development of the East Brisbane area in the early part of the 20th century and illustrating the way of life of affluent families over a period of eighty years. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Kitawah demonstrates the principal characteristics of a substantial timber urban residence. Set in extensive grounds and impressive in its scale, finish and design excellence, Kitawah is a key example of affluent domestic housing in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building exhibits outstanding architectural quality and has significance as a surviving, intact example of the mature work of important Queensland architect Robert S.(Robin) Dods. The handling of form, scale, materials and details are exemplary. In particular, the interior finishes and planning are highly intact and of superior quality. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. Acknowledged as one of Dods most complex and sophisticated domestic designs, Kitawah demonstrates a high degree of creative achievement in the development of Queensland housing and has a special association with the work of RS Dods. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.

Approximation-preserving reductions are a subset of more general reductions in complexity theory; the difference is that approximation-preserving reductions usually make statements on approximation problems or optimization problems, as opposed to decision problems. Intuitively, problem A is reducible to problem B via an approximation-preserving reduction if, given an instance of problem A and a (possibly approximate) solver for problem B, one can convert the instance of problem A into an instance of problem B, apply the solver for problem B, and recover a solution for problem A that also has some guarantee of approximation. Definition Unlike reductions on decision problems, an approximation-preserving reduction must preserve more than the truth of the problem instances when reducing from one problem to another. It must also maintain some guarantee on the relationship between the cost of the solution to the cost of the optimum in both problems. To formalize: Let A and B be optimization problems. Let x be an instance of problem A, with optimal solution OPT(x). Let c_A(x, y) denote the cost of a solution y to an instance x of problem A. This is also the metric used to determine which solution is considered optimal. An approximation-preserving reduction is a pair of functions (f, g) (which often must be computable in polynomial time), such that: * f maps an instance x of A to an instance x' of B. * g maps a solution y' of B to a solution y of A. * g preserves some guarantee of the solution's performance, or approximation ratio, defined as R_A(x, y) = \\\\max \\\\left ( \\\\frac{c_A(x, OPT(x))}{c_A(x, y)}, \\\\frac{c_A(x, y)}{c_A(x, OPT(x))} \\\\right ).  Types  There are many different types of approximation-preserving reductions, all of which have a different guarantee (the third point in the definition above). However, unlike with other reductions, approximation- preserving reductions often overlap in what properties they demonstrate on optimization problems (e.g. complexity class membership or completeness, or inapproximability). The different types of reductions are used instead as varying reduction techniques, in that the applicable reduction which is most easily adapted to the problem is used. Not all types of approximation- preserving reductions can be used to show membership in all approximability complexity classes, the most notable of which are PTAS and APX. A reduction below preserves membership in a complexity class C if, given a problem A that reduces to problem B via the reduction scheme, and B is in C, then A is in C as well. Some reductions shown below only preserve membership in APX or PTAS, but not the other. Because of this, careful choice must be made when selecting an approximation-preserving reductions, especially for the purpose of proving completeness of a problem within a complexity class. Crescenzi suggests that the three most ideal styles of reduction, for both ease of use and proving power, are PTAS reduction, AP reduction, and L-reduction. The reduction descriptions that follow are from Crescenzi's survey of approximation- preserving reductions. = Strict reduction = Strict reduction is the simplest type of approximation-preserving reduction. In a strict reduction, the approximation ratio of a solution y' to an instance x' of a problem B must be at most as good as the approximation ratio of the corresponding solution y to instance x of problem A. In other words: : R_A(x, y) \\\\le R_B(x', y') for x' = f(x), y = g(y'). Strict reduction is the most straightforward: if a strict reduction from problem A to problem B exists, then problem A can always be approximated to at least as good a ratio as problem B. Strict reduction preserves membership in both PTAS and APX. There exists a similar concept of an S-reduction, for which c_A(x, y) = c_B(x', y'), and the optima of the two corresponding instances must have the same cost as well. S-reduction is a very special case of strict reduction, and is even more constraining. In effect, the two problems A and B must be in near-perfect correspondence with each other. The existence of an S-reduction implies not only the existence of a strict reduction but every other reduction listed here. = L-reduction = L-reductions preserve membership in PTAS as well as APX (but only for minimization problems in the case of the latter). As a result, they cannot be used in general to prove completeness results about APX, Log-APX, or Poly-APX, but nevertheless they are valued for their natural formulation and ease of use in proofs. = PTAS-reduction = PTAS-reduction is another commonly used reduction scheme. Though it preserves membership in PTAS, it does not do so for APX. Nevertheless, APX-completeness is defined in terms of PTAS reductions. PTAS-reductions are a generalization of P-reductions, shown below, with the only difference being that the function g is allowed to depend on the approximation ratio r. = A-reduction and P-reduction = A-reduction and P-reduction are similar reduction schemes that can be used to show membership in APX and PTAS respectively. Both introduce a new function c, defined on numbers greater than 1, which must be computable. In an A-reduction, we have that :R_B(x', y') \\\\le r \\\\rightarrow R_A(x, y) \\\\le c(r). In a P-reduction, we have that :R_B(x', y') \\\\le c(r) \\\\rightarrow R_A(x, y) \\\\le r. The existence of a P-reduction implies the existence of a PTAS-reduction. = E-reduction = E-reduction, which is a generalization of strict reduction but implies both A-reduction and P-reduction, is an example of a less restrictive reduction style that preserves membership not only in PTAS and APX, but also the larger classes Log-APX and Poly-APX. E-reduction introduces two new parameters, a polynomial p and a constant \\\\beta. Its definition is as follows. In an E-reduction, we have that for some polynomial p and constant \\\\beta, * c_B(OPT_B(x')) \\\\le p(x) c_A(OPT_A(x)), where x denotes the size of the problem instance's description. * For any solution y' to B, we have R_A(x, y) \\\\le 1 + \\\\beta \\\\cdot (R_B(x', y') - 1). To obtain an A-reduction from an E-reduction, let c(r) = 1+\\\\beta \\\\cdot (r-1), and to obtain a P-reduction from an E-reduction, let c(r) = 1 + (r-1)/\\\\beta. = AP-reduction = AP-reductions are used to define completeness in the classes Log-APX and Poly-APX. They are a special case of PTAS reduction, meeting the following restrictions. In an AP-reduction, we have that for some constant \\\\alpha, : R_B(x', y') \\\\le r \\\\rightarrow R_A(x, y) \\\\le 1 + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot (r-1) with the additional generalization that the function g is allowed to depend on the approximation ratio r, as in PTAS-reduction. AP-reduction is also a generalization of E-reduction. An additional restriction actually needs to be imposed for AP- reduction to preserve Log-APX and Poly-APX membership, as E-reduction does: for fixed problem size, the computation time of f, g must be non-increasing as the approximation ratio increases. = Gap reduction = A gap reduction is a type of reduction that, while useful in proving some inapproximability results, does not resemble the other reductions shown here. Gap reductions deal with optimization problems within a decision problem container, generated by changing the problem goal to distinguishing between the optimal solution and solutions some multiplicative factor worse than the optimum.

These powers were Assyria, Babylon, Egyptian Empire, Hittite Empire, and Mitanni, viz. the major powers in Mesopotamia, the Levant and Anatolia. This period saw a systematic rise and fall of civilizations. Many civilizations went through the same cycle of creation, fluorescence, and fall of centralized states which include: the middle Elamite kingdom in western Iran, Kassite Babylonia in southern Mesopotamia, the Hittite new kingdom in Anatolia, and the new kingdom Egypt. While they did not all rise to the equal amount of power and influence at the same time, they did organize and participate in an international system of diplomacy, trade, and culture.Van De Mieroop, Marc. \\"The Club of Great Powers.\\" In A History of the Ancient Near East, Ca. 3000-323 B.C. 2nd ed., Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Pub., 2007, As states went through cycles of growth and expansion, usually one or two states were more powerful than the rest, and a political hierarchy was naturally formed, with each state knowing their respective place. As leaders rose to power in respective states throughout the regions and although they wanted to expand their empire and grow their power, they realized the immense benefits of diplomacy. A system of trade, not of the state‚Äôs resources, but of the properties of the kings, was initiated. Items traded States interacted through letters, written in Akkadian, the international language of diplomacy, and through oral messages. Marriages were a sure way to strengthen diplomatic ties and peace. One exception to this system was Egypt, which never gave royal women, but happily accepted the royal women of other states. Another commonly traded item was gifts. Each state had a specialty in what they could produce in their region. Egypt mined gold, Lebanon logged cedars, murex shells valued for their dye came from Northern Africa, Canaan specialized in jewelry, and Cyprus had its glass, beads of gold, faience, and agate. Sources One of the main primary sources we have of this Club of Great Powers comes from the Amarna letters in Egypt. King Akhenaten moved the capital of Egypt to Amarna and there kept the correspondence of him and his father with the rest of the members of the Club of Great Powers. A collection of 350 clay tablets was found there. The vast majority of the letters were written to Egypt‚Äôs vassals in the Syria-Palestine region, and a minority are written to kings whom the Egyptians kings considered equal. They were the kings of Babylonia, Assyria, Mittani, Hatti, Alashiya (on Cyprus), and Arzawa (in south-west Anatolia). Collections of letters on clay tablets are also found throughout the Near East.

One of many Little Saigons in the U.S., this neighborhood near Washington, D.C., became a hub of Vietnamese commerce and social activity, and reached its peak during the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The opening of the WMATA Clarendon Metro station led to new development, generating higher rents, and businesses closed or relocated, notably to the nearby Eden Center. Influx of Vietnamese Toward the end of the Vietnam War in the 1970s, immigration from Vietnam to the United States increased considerably. Before 1975, only about 15,000 Vietnamese immigrants lived in the United States. By 1980, about 245,000 Vietnamese lived in the U.S., with about 91 percent of the population arriving in the previous five years.Barringer, Herbert, Robert W. Gardner, and Michael J. Levin. 1996. Asian and Pacific Islanders in the United States. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 46 Vietnamese immigrants fled their country in two distinct waves. The first large wave of immigration occurred in 1975 and included elites and highly educated residents who left with the fall of Saigon.O'Connell, Kim A. 2003. \\"Catching Two Fish With Two Hands: Preserving Vietnamese Heritage in Virginia's Little Saigon\\". Goucher College.Wood, Joseph. 1997. Vietnamese Place Making in Northern Virginia. Geographical Review. 87 (1): 58-72. Many left in fear for their lives or were escaping imprisonment as they had either worked for the former South Vietnamese government or supported the regime. For Vietnamese who lived through the war and under Communist control, many mistrusted banks and feared the volatility of paper money; keeping money in the form of gold or jewelry was common.Workman James A. 1993 \\"Vietnamese Business Owners Make Indelible Mark.\\" Washington Business Journal. September 17‚Äì23 From the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, most refugees left Vietnam by boat. These refugees, commonly referred to as \\"boat people,\\" were generally less educated than the previous wave of immigrants who had ties to the U.S. government or were Vietnamese elites. An estimated 800,000 people fled Vietnam by boat between 1975 and 1995 and, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, between 200,000 and 400,000 boat people died at sea.Vo, Nghia M. 2005. Vietnamese Boat People, 1954 and 1975-1992. McFarland & Company: North Carolina The Washington, D.C. metropolitan area was a desirable choice for Vietnamese immigrants to settle for several reasons. Many of the first-wave Vietnamese immigrants had ties to the U.S. government or the embassy. Northern Virginia emerged as a suitable location within the region for resettlement for several reasons. Embassy officials pointed refugees toward Northern Virginia, and Arlington offered the availability of sponsors such as the Catholic Church. Once the first wave of immigrants settled in Arlington, existing family and social ties established the network for future immigrants to join this population. By the end of the Vietnamese War, 15%, or 3,000, of the nation's Vietnamese population resided in the Washington, D.C. area, and many more joined. The most densely settled Vietnamese areas in Northern Virginia were along Wilson Boulevard and Columbia Pike, extending west towards Falls Church and Annandale. Development in Clarendon Until the mid-1900s, Clarendon was Arlington County's premier downtown shopping area and a bustling streetcar suburb.Ehrenhalt, Alan. \\"The Great Inversion.\\" Vintage Books: New York. 2012. However, during the 1960s and 70s, competition from regional shopping malls and strip shopping centers caused downtown Clarendon to decline. Many businesses relocated, leaving behind vacant storefronts. The historic building stock suffered from neglect and by the mid-1970s, construction of the WMATA Clarendon Metro station began to tear up the streets and sidewalks. These conditions were conducive to cheap, short-term commercial leases, which the Vietnamese refugees seized as an opportunity to open businesses and support their families. In light of the Metro construction, rent fell as low as $1.50 to $5 a square foot in some buildings,Arnett, Elsa (September 4, 1989). \\"Arlington Losing Ethnic Flavor; Construction Displaces Vietnamese Businesses.\\" The Washington Post: a01.Drummond, Ayers Jr. (November 6, 1989). N.Y. Times News Service. Daily Press: 04. making this area economically attractive for the recently immigrated population. The first Vietnamese business, the Saigon Market grocery store, opened in 1972 by a former employee of the Vietnamese Embassy, and a second grocery store, Vietnam Center, was opened by the Vietnamese wife of a CIA employee. Soon more Vietnamese people began to open shops and restaurants in Clarendon, and the area was transformed into the hub of the East Coast Vietnamese community. Refugee assistance groups and churches organized trips that brought immigrants from Alexandria and elsewhere to Clarendon to shop. Shops opened to sell specialized goods to the Vietnamese community. Major attractions were the Vietnamese grocery stores, which sold ingredients unavailable in American markets.Davis, Melissa. 1980. \\"Take the Orange Line Over to Little Saigon.\\" The Washington Post, January 17: E1. Little Saigon offered a variety of business types and styles. Some businesses developed the ambiance of a flea market or bazaar since it was common for multiple businesses to operate within a single building. My An Fabric store had multiple businesses within the same building, including a billiards and arcade game room and a small cafe Priest.Dana. \\"Arlington's Boulevard of Contrasts; Asian Shops Share Wilson Strip With Ballston Commons.\\" The Washington Post. 11 May 1987: d01.

Kim Cook established Vietnamese Resettlement Association in Falls Church and Khuc Minh Tho founded the Families of Vietnamese Political Prisoners Association. Vietnamese entrepreneurs faced many hurdles as they tried to achieve success in Clarendon. Because banks would not lend to them, Vietnamese entrepreneurs had to borrow money from friends and family to start their businesses, often at higher interest rates than what was commercially available. Some business owners experienced regulatory hurdles because they didn't understand the business licensing and regulations, and were fined. To raise capital, some immigrants had to sell off much of their family's gold and jewelry. One traditional Vietnamese lending practice known as \\"hoi\\" was a common funding tool. Hoi pools money from businesspeople in the community and distributes it to a member of the community in a monthly bidding process. The loan candidate who bids the highest interest rate for the entire pot gets the money. Over time, the Vietnamese-American business community increased its efficacy. For example, Toa Do, who worked his way up from his first American job as a messenger to a systems analyst and then an independent consultant, became the first Vietnamese person to have a seat on the Arlington Chamber of Commerce. The Clarendon Vietnamese Retail Business Association was formed by Kham Dinh Do, proprietor of the Dat Hung jewelry store, who tried to organize the Vietnamese business community and advocate on behalf of their interests as Arlington County government was planning for the development of Clarendon.Hsu, Evelyn. 1989. \\"Plan Would Reshape Clarendon With High-Rises, Old Facades;Proposal to Preserve Ethnic Shops, Restaurants Eases Merchants' Fear of Being Forced Out of \`Little Saigon.'\\" The Washington Post. November 18: b01. Decline The neighborhood declined for several reasons. Many building owners did not spend money maintaining or updating their buildings because they were waiting for the Metro station to open and new economic opportunities to be realized through the redevelopment of Clarendon.Currier, Julie. 1990. \\"Exodus of Vietnamese Businesses from Arlington Precedes Area Redevelopment.\\" Washington Sun. June 21. Development didn't increase significantly in Clarendon for the first few years after Metro opened in 1979. There were multiple small parcels of land held by absentee owners that made it difficult for developers to purchase areas large enough for the new, big projects that were envisioned.Priest, Dana. \\"Arlington's Boulevard of Contrasts; Asian Shops Share Wilson Strip With Ballston Commons.\\" The Washington Post. 11 May 1987: d01. On November 18, 1989, the Arlington County Board unanimously endorsed Clarendon's redevelopment plan, which envisioned high-rise commercial structures, mid-rise residential buildings, parks, and pedestrian walkways.Mathews, Marylyn P. (September 11, 1989). \\"Goodbye, Little Saigon.\\" The Washington Post: pg. A10 The plan also proposed incentives for constructing buildings lower than zoning code allowed and to carve out smaller-scaled commercial space for smaller-scaled businesses. Eventually, rents began to increase in Clarendon (up to $25‚Äì30 a square foot in some commercial buildings), and Vietnamese were displaced from Arlington. The Vietnamese population that settled in the garden apartments of Arlington moved westward, with many settling around Seven Corners, as well as Falls Church near the intersection of Graham Road and Arlington Boulevard. Vietnamese- American residents had dispersed from Arlington along with the Vietnamese- American businesses. By 1984, 60% of Vietnamese-Americans lived within three miles of Seven Corners. Gradually, the number of Vietnamese businesses in Little Saigon contracted. In 1989, the Clarendon Alliance, a business association, noted that of the 76 businesses in Clarendon, between 30 and 35 were Asian-owned, and among those, most were Vietnamese-owned. The establishments ranged from food markets, real estate and insurance agencies, law and accounting firms, and restaurants and retailers. That same year, the Mekong Center grocery store, the Pacific Oriental Department Store, the My An 1 restaurant and the Alpha Camera repair shop left the Hartford Building, which was then demolished. The My An fabric store relocated from the building before it was demolished since the owner anticipated changes in Clarendon with the plan for high-density development. Business remained steady for the establishments that remained, although the once-large crowds of Vietnamese customers dwindled, and the neighborhood's value as a community meeting ground had dissipated. Author Alan Ehrenhalt points out that for the economically struggling Clarendon of the 1960s, \\"it was immigration that brought those old buildings to life... The vacant storefronts brought the Vietnamese in and set the whole process in motion. It may seem a bit ironic that the way to bring in more affluent white newcomers is to lay down a base of poorer people from other countries. But that is exactly what happened in Arlington\\". The decline of Little Saigon was noticeable. A letter to the editor of the Washington Post lamented the small business culture that was fading from Clarendon. The writer recognized the contributions of the Vietnamese people and the diversity they brought to Arlington. County planners explained that the government discussed plans for many years that would turn Clarendon into a higher-density, mixed- use corridor that would have larger development projects and bigger retail spaces.Fischer 2006 Planners noted the current change and inevitability of pressure on the small businesses from development. Long-time customers and business owners have mixed sentiments about the end of Little Saigon. Some business owners expressed resentment and frustration that they were being pushed out. Other business owners were able to relocate to shopping centers that offered better parking and maintained properties. Efforts were made to retain the ethnic small business community, although they weren't endeavored until after the predominant decline of Little Saigon. In 1993, Arlington County published a bilingual (English and Vietnamese) guide to starting a business in Arlington, which was targeted to Vietnamese business people. Arlington County has since initiated ongoing small business assistance through the Economic Development Authority, which is a recommendation in the 2006 Clarendon Sector Plan.Arlington County. 2006. ‚ÄúClarendon Sector Plan.‚Äù The Clarendon neighborhood in 2014 has become mostly a mix of retail, bars and restaurants, increasing residential, and office uses. The development subsequent to the decline of Little Saigon typically has larger footprints, such as 3,000 square feet, which typically are not suitable for small, independently owned businesses.Hart, Kim. 2006. \\"More Urban, Less Village; Thriving, Growing Clarendon Risks Losing Its Offbeat Edge.\\" November 3: D.1.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This two-storeyed house was built for William Henry Genn, a plumber, iron worker and wood carver. Latrobe Street was created along with the mid-1880s subdivision of the Mowbraytown Estate, from which East Brisbane derives much of its historical identity. The Estate was part of a substantial parcel of East Brisbane land, including what is now Mowbray Park, alienated in the 1850s by the \\"father\\" of Presbyterianism in Queensland, Rev. Thomas Mowbray. Mowbray died in 1867, and in 1884 his widow sold part of the estate to Josiah Young of Brisbane. Young immediately subdivided this land as the Mowbraytown Estate, prior to the introduction of the Undue Subdivision of Land Act 1885, which limited residential blocks to no less than . The Mowbraytown blocks were long, narrow allotments of between , and attracted mostly working class and lower middle class purchasers. By 1887 there were 13 houses in Latrobe Street, including Genn's house, most of which were occupied by artisans. Unusually for Brisbane, where milled timber was the cheapest available building product, Genn's house was constructed of bricks from William Williams' brickyard at Lutwyche. Williams' bricks are identified from the frog, or imprint, of an open hand with a heart. La Trobe most likely derived its name from its location in Latrobe Street, and was known as such by 1922. It appears to have been used mostly as a rental property, and has changed ownership many times. In the late 1940s it was converted into three flats. Subsequent alterations and conversions included the enclosing of verandahs. New owners began refurbishment in the early 1980s. This included the opening of the verandahs with cast-iron balustrading, and a new kitchen on the site of the original.  Description  left The main facade of this two-storeyed brick dwelling has a timber verandah with cast-iron balustrading, timber valance on the lower level and cast-iron fringe to the upper level. The brickwork has rendered quoins, jambs and lintels. Five pairs of French doors and the front door all have fanlights. The internal walls are lined with tongue and groove boards. Both floors have a central passageway with one long room on the left, which includes a fireplace with cast-iron grate and timber surround. On the right are two rooms and the staircase. The ground floor rear verandah has a convex iron roof and is enclosed. On the left hand side it provides access to the modern replacement kitchen, family room, laundry and storeroom. Mature street trees complement this refurbished dwelling.  Heritage listing  La Trobe was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It illustrates the rapid development of East Brisbane during the boom of the 1880s, especially following the subdivision of the Mowbraytown Estate , and makes an important contribution to the historical character of East Brisbane and to the Latrobe Street streetscape. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. La Trobe, erected , is a fine example of a small, two-storeyed, 1880s brick dwelling, which is uncommon in Brisbane.

It is her first young adult novel, and is set in the same universe as her bestselling Parasol Protectorate adult series. Plot Like the Parasol Protectorate books, Etiquette & Espionage is set in an alternate history version of Victorian era Britain where supernatural creatures such as vampires and werewolves are part of society. The protagonist is 14-year-old Sophronia, who enrolls in Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality. But Sophronia finds out that this is not an ordinary finishing school; in addition to dance, dress, and etiquette, she and her classmates are also trained in the fine arts of espionage and assassination. Reception Etiquette & Espionage was well received. It earned four starred reviews and hit the New York Times bestseller list its first week on sale. Kirkus Reviews noted that the book is lighter on romance than is typical in YA, but praises the silliness and genre-blending. Publishers Weekly praised Carriger's ability to weave in commentary about race and class amidst the lighthearted fun of the book. Other reviewers noted that Carriger successfully subverts the \\"action girl\\" young adult trope, and that she successfully appeals to both age groups (adults and teens) without talking down to her young adult audience.

Also, in the Olympic Open Meet, he won the 100-yard dash and won second place in the broad jump. In the 1904 Olympic Games, \\"handicap\\" did not refer to any type of physical impairment. Instead, these were events in which some athletes, often amateurs, were given a slight advantage in position or location. These matches were additional track and field events that allowed lesser athletes the opportunity to compete head-to-head with superior professional Olympic competitors by giving them an advantage that leveled the playing field. In this era, a \\"handicap\\" winner is somewhat similar to an amateur winner of a professional event. In the 100-yard dash, Hastedt was given a 4-yard handicap, and in the 60-yard dash, he was given a 4-foot handicap. His victory in the 100-yard dash was the first won by a St. Louis, MO athlete.

The Archives was officially established in 1992 and is named after its two founders, Noun and Mary Louise Smith. __TOC__ History While researching for her book, (Strong Minded Women, 1969), Noun recognized a need for an archive that would hold women's papers and history. Noun \\"later shared with Mary Louise Smith her frustration about the scarcity of primary sources by and about women, and the two determined to establish a repository to document the experiences and achievements of women in Iowa.\\"History and Mission of the Iowa Women's Archives http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/history/ Retrieved 8 December 2014. The Archives officially opened on October 28, 1992. The first curator hired was Karen Mason, who is still working at the Archives in 2014. Mason has written papers discussing her work at the Archive. The Archive has four basic approaches to collecting papers. The Archive will publicize interest in women's papers, write letters of solicitation to individuals or groups, sponsor or attend events, or establish good working relationships with people around the state. The first collection initiative the Archive proceeded with was the African American women project in 1995, and the second was in 1998 - the Rural Women's Project. The special projects listed below will go into more detail on the history of the Archives. Special Projects = \\"Giving Our History A Home: A Celebration of African American Women in Iowa\\"Iowa Women's Archives Timeline 1995 http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/timeline/year1995/ Retrieved 6 December 2014. = As it is understood by the above Mission, the Archive was established to collect the papers of groups that were underrepresented in archives. After the first two years of collecting papers, the Archive noted it had only established a small collection of papers by African American women. By 1995, \\"the Archives was able to hire Kathryn Neal as assistant archivist to undertake the African American Women in Iowa Project.\\" Neal created her own mission statement and plan to undertake the project of collecting papers of African American women from around the state. The plan for that project was \\"1. Establish a manuscripts acquisitions program for the collection of materials that pertain to African American women in Iowa; 2. Publicize the project using a variety of media methods; 3. Develop and implement an oral history program to record the experiences of African American women in Iowa; 4. Create a comprehensive guide to African American women's collections at the IWA.\\" Neal, Kathryn. (2003). Cultivating Diversity. Collection Management, 27(2), 33-42. Retrieved 6 December 2014. Through her 3 years working as an archivist, Neal was successful in accumulating a set of 50 papers for the collection. =Rural Women's Project= The Rural Women's Project began in 1998. With a grant from the Iowa Farm Bureau Foundation, the Archive was able to hire an assistant temporary archivist for two years named Doris Malkmus. As Malkmus traveled around the state, she collected diaries, account books, photo albums, and scrapbooks. When the project ended in 2001, more than 100 collections of rural women were collected, and they ‚Äúprovide rich resources that chronicle the lives and experiences of rural and farm women throughout Iowa‚Äôs history.‚ÄùIowa Women‚Äôs Archives Timeline 1998 http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/timeline/year1998/ Retrieved 6 December 2014. =Mujeres Latinas Project= This project was undertaken by the Archives in 2005 to preserve the history of Latinas in Iowa over the years. The lives of Latinas in Iowa are often those of migrant workers that travel year round following the crops. With the sort of mobile and busy life led by migrant farm workers, the women often were unable to be educated or did not have the time to learn to read or write. They did not create written papers of their own, and there were very few newspaper articles written about them. With that in mind, the Archive chose to create oral histories for these women. ‚ÄúOral recordings have the added value of conveying emotion and character in a way that papers cannot. For a researcher, listening to a recording and a manner of speaking ‚Äì accents, intonation, pauses, laughter, crying ‚Äì creates a more intimate connection with the speaker and can contribute to a better understanding of her experience.\\" Mason, K.

During her tenure the Charles Perkins Centre was established. In 2015, Trewhella took up the Tage Erlander Visiting Professorship in Sweden, based mainly at Link√∂ping University, where she networked with Swedish researchers to develop projects that would take advantage of new infrastructure for X-ray and neutron scattering studies to characterize materials, including biological materials where the object was to understand biological function and provide a foundation for advances in medicine and biotechnology. Having completed her Tage Erlander Visiting Professorship, she now continues her interests in science as a Professor Emerita at Sydney in the Faculty of Science and an Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at the University of Utah.  Research  Trewhella's research focuses on the use of chemistry, physics and computational methods to study bio-molecular structures as a basis for understanding their functions. She uses small angle x-ray scattering to investigate protein structure. Trewhella has published more than 150 research papers, book chapters, essays, articles and reports. Her work has been recognised with a number of competitive research grants, awards and honours, including being named as a fellow of the Neutron Scattering Society of America in 2010, and a distinguished fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 2011.

They met at the age of fifteen, trained at the same glass school, and have almost always worked collaboratively. Training Marie Simberg-H√∂glund was born in 1955 in Gothenburg, Sweden and trained at Orrefors Glass Studios and then Kosta Boda. After focusing on engraving at Kosat Boda, Marie went on to two years studying handweaving and fabric design at Emmaboda College. Ola H√∂glund was born in 1956 in Stockholm, Sweden. Between 1972 and 1977 he trained at Orrefors Glass Studios and Kosta Boda. Work in Sweden and Swaziland In 1977 the two worked together at Vastkusthyttans Art Glass Studio, Marie as a designer-engraver and Ola as a designer-glassblower. From there they were sent in 1978 to Swaziland by the Swedish International Development Authority, where they spent three years there establishing a workshop and teaching glassblowing skills. Work in New Zealand In 1982, they emigrated to Nelson, New Zealand. Shortly after they arrived, potter Jack Laird invited them to set up a studio at Craft Habitat in Nelson, where they remained for 9 years. In 1994 they established H√∂glund Glassblowing Studio in Nelson. Ola typically blows the glass and Marie applies the surface treatment to the objects they create. Laird, writing about their work in 1987, noted that 'They see themselves as a team, jointly working on all projects, and developing ideas by responding to each other's suggestions and contributions'. In their artistic practices, they have widely used the graal technique first developed in Sweden in 1916. In 2002, they established H√∂glund Art Glass Studio in North Queensland as a winter studio. In 1999 the pair opened new gallery showrooms in Auckland, doing the same in Sydney the following year and launching a store in Melbourne in 2001. In 1999, they were officially appointed glass artists for the America's Cup and they produced glassware for Team New Zealand in 2000 and 2003. In 2000 they were also awarded a license to produce official merchandise for the Sydney Olympics.

It was built in 1929. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2007.  History  The Kurilpa Library is a two-storey brick building with a projecting central clock tower and addresses the main street in the inner Brisbane suburb of West End. It was constructed by the Brisbane City Council and opened in 1929. The provision of libraries by municipal councils in Queensland is a relatively new phenomenon, with most libraries currently operating having been established since the late 1940s. Previously, Schools of Arts and privately owned Reading Rooms provided books for loan by subscription. Schools of Arts or Mechanics Institutes were established in Britain in the early 1800s with the declared intention of assisting self-improvement and promoting moral, social and intellectual growth, by providing lectures, classes and lending libraries to a rising middle class. At the time there were no public libraries and books were expensive, so that providing access to them for a moderate subscription was an important educational and recreational service. Local councils had sometimes subsidised Schools of Arts and were granted authority in the Local Government Act 1878 to establish and operate libraries, although this was very uncommon until the twentieth century. Kurilpa Library was the first publicly funded municipal library in Queensland and South Brisbane Library opened soon afterwards. However, local councils did not become seriously involved in the construction of libraries in Queensland until after the Libraries Act 1943 was passed which provided for the establishment of a State Library Board and the improvement of library services throughout the state. The City of South Brisbane was at one time a municipality in its own right, but was amalgamated, together with the other local government authorities of the Brisbane area, into the Brisbane City Council in 1925. The South Brisbane Council urgently requested that its scheme for building a library at West End be progressed. They had been approached by the committee of the West End School of Arts for in order to erect a new library with accommodation for a caretaker. Ernest Barstow, Alderman for Kurilpa, supported this request and the City Architect was requested to prepare plans and estimates. The Kurilpa War Memorial Committee provided funding for a clock tower to commemorate the soldiers from the district. The clock played the Westminster Chimes every quarter-hour. Kurilpa was the name given to a locality covering South Brisbane, West End and Hill End by local aborigines. European settlers borrowed this name for a small township that grew up within West End, near the existing library and this name is inscribed on the library building. The City Architect was Alfred Herbert Foster who served in this position from 1925 until his death in 1932. Alfred Herbert Foster was an articled pupil of noted architect George Henry Male Addison. He trained and worked in London for six years before returning to Brisbane and forming the practice of Stanley and Foster in 1902. He worked for the Queensland Government, and then became Architectural Assistant to the City Engineer in 1913. During his time as City Architect he designed several well- known municipal buildings including the Fortitude Valley Baths. West End School of Arts under construction, 1928 The building was completed in 1929 and was the first purpose built municipal library in Queensland. The clock and tower formed a distinctive part of the building, emphasising its civic nature. The clock and chimes were unveiled by James Porter Fry, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Kurilpa on 21 April 1929. The construction of the library helped to reinforce and define the commercial and civic centre of West End. The building is still in use as a library and the upper level rooms are used for meetings. Little change has occurred other than the enclosure of the rear verandah to both floors in late 1959. In the early 1980s complaints by neighbours lead to the chimes of the clock tower being decommissioned. However, they were restored in 2007 with a compromise of chiming only on the hour from 9am to 6pm on weekdays and 10am to 6pm on weekends.  Description  Kurilpa Library is sited on Boundary Street, close to the intersection with Vulture Street and the commercial centre of West End. It is a two-storey brick building with a central clock tower that also contains a peal of bells. It is neo Georgian in style, symmetrical in form and with classical references. The ground floor is higher than the first and rests on a rendered course contributing to the visual solidity of the base of the building. The openings on the ground floor are all of arched brickwork with moulded keystones. The main entrance has a pair of timber doors with a fanlight above and a prominent keystone. The division between levels is emphasised by a moulded stringcourse and cornice. This carries the wording \\"KURILPA LIBRARY\\" above the entry in bronze lettering. Otherwise it consists of alternating moulded rectangles separated by circles. The tower continues above the entry with plain pilasters supporting a moulded classical pediment with a dentilled cornice, and flanking another arched opening with a moulded keystone. The windows to each side of the tower on the first floor are square headed, as are those on the sides. Above them the eaves of the terracotta tiled hipped roof are decorated with a supporting row of brackets. The tower penetrates the roof form and continues up to a third storey. On each face it has a recessed arch with a hood mould containing a clock with Roman numerals above two smaller arches of fixed louvers. Plain pilasters run to either side of recesses from a heavily moulded base to a crisp cornice line. The copper dome has a small cast finial. Inside, the small entrance lobby contains a bronze honour board on the right hand side. It opens onto a high-ceilinged room that occupies the whole of the original ground area and contains the library. To the rear of this is a narrow room created by the enclosure of the verandahs, which contains library support facilities. The upper floor has a large room used for meetings and two small offices. There is a tearoom to the rear in the enclosed verandah space. The clock tower is reached by an access hatch and contains a full peal of bells as well as the clock. The front fence is designed to match the building, having pillars with moulded tops incorporating rosettes. The base of the fence is brick with a capping mould above, which is an iron railing of crosspieces with central circles similar to that of the entry balustrade. A low hedge is situated between the building and the fence. The land behind the building is enclosed and contains a landscaped area directly behind the building and small car park.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Kurilpa Library is important in demonstrating the development of public lending libraries in Queensland. Purpose built by the Brisbane City Council in 1929 before the Libraries Act of 1943 and the establishment of the State Library Board, it illustrates a transition between 19th century subscription services, such as that provided by Schools of Arts, and the modern library network. The quality of the building and its prominent position illustrate the importance given to encouraging literacy and to reading as a recreation in the early 20th century It is important for its association with the development of the West End district, and is evidence for the provision of civic amenities in response to its growth in the early 20th century.

Otto Walter, his father, owned a printing company, and had made a small family company to one of the most prestigious printing companies and publishers of Switzerland, the Roman Catholic-oriented Walter Verlag in Olten. The only son was seen as the successor of his father, and therefore he was sent from 1940 to 1942 to the monastery school at the Engelberg Abbey, that he called a restricted area exclusively for men, but he abandoned. Otto Friedrich finished his scholar education at the Kollegium Maria Hilf in Schwyz from 1945 to 1947, thenafter he started a three-year education as bookseller in Z√ºrich, and graduated from the beginnings of the career that was expected of me.

Walter was the manager of the literary editorial in the Walter publishing house, and rebuilt engaged and successfully, a demanding program line, which at the end of the 1950s became one of the best, most innovative publishing addresses in Switzerland. Authors such as Alfred Andersch, Peter Bichsel, Helmut Heissenb√ºttel, Alexander Kluge, Kurt Marti, and J√∂rg Steiner were published, but not Otto F. Walter himself. After Walter had first published his works in M√ºnchen, submerged problems in his own publishing house increased. Walter's progressive program found little support by the conservative company itself, nor by his Catholic family, despite balanced balance sheet. On the occasion of the publication of Ernst Jandl's novel \\"laut und luise\\" in 1966, Otto F. Walter broke with the Walter Verlag, because his increasingly avant-garde alignment collided with the interests of the shareholders of the conservative Catholic publisher in 1967. The publications of the publishing house suffered from the leakage of Walter, and in the 1990s it was acquired by the Patmos publishing group.  Achievements as writer  In 1959 Walter's first novel \\"Der Stumme\\" (literally: The Silent) found the attention of a wide readership, published in the K√∂sel Verlag M√ºnchen, as well as three years later the novel \\"Mr. Tourel\\", and again three years afterwards appeared the theater play \\"Elio oder Eine fr√∂hliche Gesellschaft\\" (literally: Elio or a happy society). Especially the two novels convinced the criticism and achieved a very positive feedback. In 1967, Walter was the head of the literary and sociological program in the Luchterhand Verlag Walter. In this function, he co-founded the Luchterhand collection. Ascended to the head of the publishing house, Walter left M√ºnchen in 1973, and returned again to Switzerland, first to Oberbipp and later to Solothurn, to turn increasingly to write. Otto F. Walter wrote further novels, short stories, plays and poems. In his novels, the fictional Jura town \\"Jammers\\" (ironical for sorrow oder misery) was used to prevail the technique of a 'montaged novel'. The search for new, independent literatural forms shaped his socio-critical works \\"Die ersten Unruhen\\" (1972, literally: The first riots), \\"Die Verwilderung\\" (1977, literally: The savagery) and \\"Wie wird Beton zu Gras\\" (1979, literally: How is turning concrete to grass). Rowohlt published these novels respectively Eduard Reifferscheidt, the owner of the Luchterhand publishing house, granted a generous publisher contract, and facilitated Otto F. Walter transitioning as a free author. His novels distinguished themselves through their passionate presence cover and their current theme, and appeared at regular intervals at the then Rowohlt publishing house. In 1982 Walter finally finished the work as publisher, and devoted himself to free writing. A selection of essays and speeches appeared in 1988 under the title \\"Gegenwort\\" (Keenly) at the Limmat Verlag Z√ºrich. His novel \\"Das Staunen der Schlafwandler am Ende der Nacht\\" (1983, literally: The amazement of the sleepwalker at the end of the Night) triggered a silent hiss realism debate, and as Otto F. Walter's literally counterparty acted his friend Niklaus Meienberg. In 1980 Otto F. Walter started the work on the extensive family and era novel \\"Zeit des Fasans\\" (1988, literally: Time of the pheasant), in which Walter sat with his own origins and Switzerland's position during the Third Reich. In 1993, a further novel was published, \\"Die verlorene Geschichte\\", a passionate portrait of a xenophobe, the last testimony of Otto F. Walter's literary contemporariness.  Political work  Walter served in literary field as a co-founder of the author association Gruppe Olten (1969), as well as he initiated the Solothurn literary festival. In the 1980s, Otto F Walter increasingly collaborated in political discussions. As an active member of the SP Switzerland, he became involved in the anti-nuclear movement, the peace movement and the so-called movement for an open, democratic and solidarity Switzerland (BODS) in 1986. Otto Friedich Walter had been an active member of the political party SP Schweiz, and was active in various other progressive political movements. Otto F. Walter died after a long disease on pulmonary cancer in Solothurn on 24 September 1994.

First opened in October 2014, it includes the Lotte World Tower, the Lotte World Mall building, and the Avenue L building. The Lotte World Mall's site comprises 26,000 square meters, with a total floor area of 244,000 square meters. The Lotte World Mall building and Lotte World Tower are connected by an underground plaza.  History  In 1987, the Lotte Group envisioned the second Lotte World which would take the form of a skyscraper right next to the Lotte World site. In December 1994, the second Lotte World project was announced, at the time planned to be a 450 meter tall skyscraper with 108 floors. Although construction was planned to commence sometime in the late 1990s, the project was delayed due to the financial crisis in South Korea and visibility problems at the runway of the Seongnam Seoul Airport. In 2002, the plan for the Lotte World Tower was increased from its original 108 floors to 123 floors (555m). In 2006, the tower was given the name \\"Lotte Super Tower\\" at its groundbreaking ceremony. In 2009, construction of the tower began, with Seoul Airport changing the angle of one of its runways by three degrees to make room for it. In the May of that year, the construction of the second Lotte World Complex began, officially named \\"Lotte World Mall\\" in October 2013. During the mall's construction, several incidents occurred, including the death of a construction worker due to the bursting of a high- pressure cap and the injury of a passerby due to a glass railing fixture falling from the third floor. In May 2014, the Lotte World Mall was scheduled to be open temporarily, but the plan was delayed. The Lotte World Mall was finally opened in October 2014, with Avenue L, Lotte Mart, and Hi-Mart opening on October 14 and Lotte Cinema, Lotte Duty-Free Shop, and Lotte World Aquarium opening on October 15. In December, the Lotte World Mall's cinema and aquarium were closed due to screen vibrations and a tank leak, respectively. Both reopened after five months with the approval of the Seoul Metropolitan Government. A workplace accident delayed the construction of the Lotte World Mall's concert hall, which eventually opened on August 18, 2016. On December 22, 2016, construction of the Lotte World Tower finished, with a ceremony being held to commemorate the occasion. The Lotte World Tower officially opened on April 3, 2017.  Shops and services  The Lotte World Mall Complex contains several buildings, including the Lotte World Tower, Avenue L, and the Lotte World Mall. The Lotte World Tower contains retail components, offices, a seven-star luxury hotel, and an officetel. The Avenue L building contains an Avenue L department store and a Lotte Duty Free Shop. The Lotte World Mall contains Lotte Mart, Hi-Mart, Lotte World Aquarium, Lotte Cinema, and Lotte Concert Hall. Lotte Mart is a hypermarket, while Lotte Hi-Mart is a home appliance and electronics store. Lotte World Aquarium is the largest and longest aquarium in South Korea, containing thirteen \\"theme zones\\" meant to represent different ecosystems. The acquarium is home to over fifty-five thousand marine animals from 650 different species, ranging from freshwater fish to beluga whales. Lotte Cinema is the largest cinema in Asia, with its 21st Supreplex G screen holding the record for the largest screen size with a width of and a height of .

He was Professor and Head of Biotechnology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, from 1988 ‚Äì 2003, and was the inaugural Director of the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) at The University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia from 2003 ‚Äì 2015.  Biography  Gray completed his university studies at The University of Sydney, graduating in 1966 with a degree in chemical engineering and biosciences with honours. He completed his PhD at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1970, studying the dynamics of protein synthesis in yeast growing in steady state continuous cultures. Gray undertook postdoctoral research as a Science Research Fellow at University College London (UCL) in the group of Professors Malcolm Lilly and Peter Dunnill. The group was receiving major funding to investigate the application of immobilised enzymes processes for industrial bioprocessing. While at UCL, Gray carried out research on a number of unit operations required for the large scale production of bioactive proteins production by bacteria, unit operations which subsequently became widely used for the production of proteins made using recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology. He then moved to the United States to work for Eli Lilly and Co, Indianapolis, Indiana, as a Senior Scientist. At Lilly‚Äôs he was responsible for developing production scale antibiotic fermentations. Lilly‚Äôs was one of the first companies to link the new knowledge of microbial genetics with bioengineering to improve the strains and bioprocesses used for antibiotic production. After five years overseas, Gray returned to Australia in 1975 to take up an academic position in the School of Biotechnology at UNSW, where his research resulted in the development of novel cyclic fed ‚Äìbatch bioprocesses for antibiotic production which markedly extended the productivity of the cultures. Gray returned to the US in 1982 where he worked for the Cetus Corporation and was a Visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Cetus was one of the first biotechnology companies developing products based on recombinant DNA technology, and pioneering the use of mammalian cell culture to express large complex biologics such as antibodies. On returning to UNSW, Gray introduced research to Australia into the use of mammalian cell cultures such as CHO cells to produce, using r-DNA technology, large complex proteins. With Professor Les Lazarus and John Shine at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research he was responsible for the first locally produced recombinant DNA derived protein to enter human clinical trials in Australia, human growth hormone. In 1984 he was a founder of the Australian Biotechnology Association, which subsequently became AusBiotech, and was one of its early Presidents. In 1988 he was appointed as Professor of Biotechnology and Head of the Department of Biotechnology at UNSW, positions that he held for over fourteen years, and led this department to be the national research leader in the field. He established and was Director of, the Bioengineering Centre at UNSW. In 1992 Gray became a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE). He has been active in the activities of the Academy since, currently serving as Vice-President with responsibilities which include championing ATSE push for role of technology led innovation in enhancing Australia‚Äôs prosperity. He is Chair of the ATSE Steering Committee pushing for the introduction of a ‚ÄòKnowledge Transfer Metric‚Äô to stimulate increased public/private research collaboration in Australia. He is also a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. He serves on the Boards of: BioPharmaceuticals Australia Pty Ltd; Engineering Conferences International (ECI) Inc, New York; ACYTE Biotechnology Pty Ltd, the UQ Diamantina Institute (UQDI), and on a number of state and federal government committees in the fields of biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and education. Gray is an active researcher who has published and patented widely in the fields of bioengineering, the production of biopharmaceuticals and stem cell technology. He holds an Honorary Professorship from Fudan University in Shanghai, one of China‚Äôs leading universities.  Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN)  In 2003 Gray was appointed the Inaugural Director of the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) and Professor of Bioengineering by The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. Under his tenure the institute grew of more than 500 people with an annual turnover of AUD$40 million, which is now known nationally and internationally as an institute with sustained multi-disciplinary research excellence, and strong collaborative links to leading global research groups and corporations. In September 2015 it was announced that Professor Gray would step down from the role of AIBN Director, to be succeeded by Professor Alan Rowan.  Research  Gray has been leading figure of antibody development using mammalian cell lines and stem cell bioprocesses. His work helped to lure attract AUD$17 million in seed funding from the Queensland Government and Australian Government in 2011 to establish a facility in the state run by DSM Biologics. At the announcement attended by former Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, Professor Gray said, \\"The collaboration with DSMB will ensure that Australian bioresearchers will be able to rapidly progress their therapeutic leads into high purity material ready for evaluation in the clinic.\\" Gray has also helped to manufacture an antibody against Hendra virus on licence from the Henry Jackson Foundation, Uniformed Services University. The antibody entered phase 1 clinical trials in 2015. The work is the first clinical trial for a Hendra virus treatment. The work has led to further collaborations to develop an antibody for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus  References  Category:Australian bioengineers Category:People from Sydney Category:University of New South Wales faculty Category:University of Sydney alumni Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Fellows of the Australian Institute of Company Directors ","title":"Peter Gray (bioengineer)"},{"id":"44644846","text":"The operating principle of a membrane osmometer. Water (below) is connected to the solution to be measured (above) via a membrane that lets water through. A membrane osmometer is a device used to indirectly measure the number average molecular weight (M_n) of a polymer sample. One chamber contains pure solvent and the other chamber contains a solution in which the solute is a polymer with an unknown M_n. The osmotic pressure of the solvent across the semipermeable membrane is measured by the membrane osmometer. This osmotic pressure measurement is used to calculate M_n for the sample.  Basic operation  A low concentration solution is created by adding a small amount of polymer to a solvent. This solution is separated from pure solvent by a semipermeable membrane. Solute cannot cross the semipermeable membrane but the solvent is able to cross the membrane. Solvent flows across the membrane to dilute the solution. The pressure required to stop the flow across the membrane is called the osmotic pressure. The osmotic pressure is measured and used to calculate M_n. In an ideally dilute solution, van ‚Äòt Hoff‚Äôs law of osmotic pressure can be used to calculate M_n from osmotic pressure. :\\\\lim_{c \\\\to 0} \\\\Big( {\\\\Pi \\\\over c} \\\\Big) = {{RT} \\\\over M_n} M_n, number average molecular weight, mass/mole R, gas constant T, absolute temperature, typically Kelvin c, concentration of polymer, mass/volume \\\\Pi, osmotic pressure  Virial equations  In practice, the osmotic pressure produced by an ideally dilute solution would be too small to be accurately measured. For accurate M_n measurements, solutions are not ideally dilute and a virial equation is used to account for deviations from ideal behavior and allow the calculation of M_n. The virial equation takes a form similar to van ‚Äòt Hoff‚Äôs law of osmotic pressure, but contains additional constants to account for non-ideal behavior: {\\\\Pi \\\\over c} = RT( {1 \\\\over M_n } + A_1 c + A_2 c^2 + A_3 c^3 + \\\\dots ) where A_n are constants and c is still the concentration of polymer 1. This virial equation may be represented in different additional forms: {\\\\Pi \\\\over c} = {A \\\\over M_n } + B c + C c^2 + D c^3 + \\\\dots {\\\\Pi \\\\over c} = M_n ( \\\\Gamma_1 + \\\\Gamma_2 c + \\\\Gamma_3 c^2 + \\\\Gamma_4 c^3 + \\\\dots ) where B and \\\\Gamma are constants and RTA_2 = B = {RT \\\\over M_n} \\\\Gamma_2.  Different membrane osmometry devices  = Static membrane osmometry = Capillary tubes are attached to both the solvent and the solution compartments. In this case the osmotic pressure is provided by the additional pressure of the fluid in the solution compartment. The difference in the height of the fluid in the capillary tube of solution compartment versus the height of the fluid in the capillary tube of the solvent compartment is measured once the solution reaches equilibrium to calculate the osmotic pressure. \\\\Pi = \\\\Delta H \\\\rho g \\\\Pi, osmotic pressure \\\\Delta H, change in height \\\\rho, density g, acceleration due to gravity The main disadvantage of static osmometry is the long time it takes for equilibrium to be reached. It often takes 3 or more hours after the solute is added for the static osmometer to reach equilibrium. = Dynamic membrane osmometry = In a dynamic osmometer flow of solvent is measured and a counteracting pressure is created to stop the flow. Flow rate of the solvent is measured by the movement of an air bubble in a capillary tube of the solvent. The pressure of the solvent compartment is directly changed by raising or lowering a reservoir of solvent connected to the solvent compartment. The pressure difference between the two compartments is the osmotic pressure. This can be calculate by measuring the change in height or measured directly with a flexible diaphragm. Since the pressure is directly changed, an accurate measurement of osmotic pressure can be achieved in 10 - 30 minutes.  Limitations of membrane osmometry  Membrane osmometry measurements are best used for 30,000 < M_n < 1,000,000 grams/mole. For M_n above 1,000,000 grams/mole, the solute is too dilute to create a measurable osmotic pressure. For M_n below 30,000 grams per mole, the solute permeates through the membrane and the measurements are inaccurate. Another issue for membrane osmometer is the limited membrane types. The most common membrane used is cellulose acetate; however, cellulose acetate can only be used with toluene and water. While toluene and water are useful solvent for many compounds, not all polymers are miscible in toluene or water. Regenerated cellulose membranes can be used for many other solvents, but are hard to obtain.

In the repechage, Chervonsky gave herself a chance for an Olympic bronze medal, but slipped it away in a defeat to two-time Olympic judoka Tatiana Moskvina of Belarus by an ippon and a tomoe nage (circle throw) within a minute into their first playoff of the draft. Chervonsky sought her bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, but failed to forge a slot to the Australian team upon losing the final to Kristie-Anne Ryder in the 52-kg division at the Oceania Championships in Christchurch, New Zealand. Following her retirement from judo in 2012, Chervonsky currently works as a mentor and public speaker and has been selected as a \\"big sister\\" for the Life Changing Experiences Foundation (LCEF), an organization that aims to help hundreds of young women facing devastating issues occurred in the contemporary society.

As described by Scott Herring, who largely popularized the term, queer anti-urbanism is ‚Äúa means to critically negotiate the relentless urbanisms that often characterize any United States based 'gay imaginary'... in which the city represents a beacon of tolerance and gay community, the country a locus of persecution and gay absence.\\" In this sense, queer anti-urbanism can be thought of as critical opposition to homonormative and metronormative ways of life. Queer metronormativity Jack Halberstam relates queer metronormativity to the dominant \\"story of migration from 'country' to 'town'... a spatial narrative within which the subject moves to a place of tolerance after enduring life in a place of suspicion, persecution, and secrecy.‚Äù This narrative purports that the only means of achieving queer community, happiness, and open existence is via an urban lifestyle, inherently devaluing rural existence by way of stereotypes concerning urban and rural ways of life. Rural people are commonly depicted in media and otherwise as un-intelligent, dirty, and intolerant; these stereotypes and myths persist largely through well-publicized rural hate crimes (i.e. Brandon Teena's assault and murder) that seemingly support stereotypes of rural people as violent bigots and of rural queers as mere victims. The propagation and persistence of these myths lend themselves to the assumption that rural queer people do not and cannot exist; queer people who live happily in rural areas are thus denied existence under the dominant view of metronormativity. This invisibility is evident in many media, academic, and judicial depictions of gay identity: for example, a television show may depict rural queers living under oppression while urban queers flourish. The cumulative effect of the metronormative narrative and the subsequent rural invisibility is that queer rural-urban migration becomes a socially- constructed compulsory act, as does adherence to the norms of metronormative/homonormative gay culture. Herring divides these norms into four categories ‚Äì the narratological, the socioeconomic, the aesthetic, and the racial. In order to ‚Äúproperly‚Äù conform to urban society, one must accept the metronormative narrative, make enough money to participate in gay male consumer culture, dress the ‚Äúright‚Äù way, and effectively \\"be white.\\" Failing to do so seemingly confirms the myths and stereotypes that underlie a metronormative worldview; metronormativity thus perpetuates itself by encouraging rural queers to hide their origins and conform, thereby further erasing rural queer life and visibility. Metronormativity operates upon the false dichotomy of rural vs. urban queer existence. It assumes that while the two existences differ from each other, there is no difference between queer life in different urban areas, nor any difference between queer life in different rural areas ‚Äì since, according to metronormative queer society, rural queer life does not exist. Critical rusticity Queer anti-urbanism manifests in practice in a variety of ways, which Herring refers to under the umbrella term of \\"critical rusticity.\\" Some examples include the rural, all- female ‚ÄúLesbian Separatist‚Äù communities that consciously spurned ‚Äúthe city‚Äù in favor of rural alternatives to a subjugated status under metronormative, white-male-centric, upper-middle-class gay culture. Such communities contradicted the gay rural-urban migration narrative, defying the values of metronormativity and replacing them with a new value system that was simultaneously rural and queer. Publications such as Rural Fairie Digest and Country Women countered rural queer erasure, provided alternatives to gay consumer culture through ‚Äòhow to‚Äôs‚Äô on DIY ‚Äòcountry skills,‚Äô and to some extent provided a sense of rural queer community even for those who were geographically isolated. Even without associating with a larger movement, queer individuals who live rural lifestyles can defy metronormativity and challenge the definition of \\"queerness\\" simply through their existence. Asserting rural queer identity in opposition to what queer identity is ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù be (i.e. urban) promotes an alternative to metronormativity, where differences in rural queer life and urban queer life are viewed not as deficiencies, but rather as value-neutral differences.

It was designed by Robert Dempster & Sons Ltd and built in 1912. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Manufacturers information This demountable cast iron tower was manufactured in 1912 by Robert Dempster & Sons Ltd, of Elland, Yorkshire, and transported in segments to Brisbane, where it was erected at the West End Gasworks in Montague Road operated by the South Brisbane Gas & Light Company. The South Brisbane Gas & Light Company was established in 1885, in direct competition to the Brisbane Gas Corporation. Initially the companies supplied gas to both sides of the Brisbane River, but in 1889 agreement was reached whereby the BGC supplied the northside, and the SBGLC to the south of the river. As a result of growing demand for gas and the need to upgrade their facilities, in 1911 the company sent their principal engineer to Britain to assess the latest in gas production technology. The decision to erect a stripping tower was a result of this visit. Gas stripping tower in its original context in South Brisbane, 1935 The tower was used in the removal of tar and ammonia from raw coal gas. Gas was piped into the base of the tower, from where it rose to the top via a series of internal baffles over which water was sprayed from a header tank at the top of the tower, stripping the gas of coal tar and ammonia in the process. The liquid was drained via a water seal at the bottom, and sold as ammonia liquor. By 1949 more sophisticated techniques were being employed to remove impurities from gas, and the tower was no longer used. With the availability of natural gas to Brisbane in the 1970s, the company's Montague Road works were made redundant and in 1975 most of the structures on the site were demolished. In the same year the stripping tower was acquired by the National Trust of Queensland, who dismantled the structure and stored it pending availability of a suitable relocation site. In 1979, it was reassembled in Davies Park, approximately from its original position. In 1988, Allgas Energy Ltd (formerly the South Brisbane Gas & Light Company) refurbished the tower and landscaped the surrounding area, as a bicentennial gift to Brisbane. Although relocated, the tower survives as the only one of its type in Australia.  Description  Commemorative plaque The gas stripping tower is constructed of curved cast components, which fit together to form a slender tower surmounted by a work platform, a water tank disguised as a lantern drum, a cupola and a superimposed weathervane. It stands approximately high with a diameter of about . Spare relief work decorates the panels, and an access stair and handrail, braced by decorative cast brackets, accentuates the profile. The 1988 renovation work involved sand blasting the exterior, repainting it in the original reddish-brown colour with an epoxy finish, and highlighting the relief work in silver. Also the cupola was removed, repaired and painted silver before being replaced on the tower. The tower is adjacent to Riverside Drive, and is visible from both river banks. Decorative paving and a commemorative plaque, which were 1988 improvements, define the immediate area.  Heritage listing  Gas Stripping Tower was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Through its association with the South Brisbane Gas and Light Company, the place demonstrates the evolution of Queensland's history, in particular the evolution of the former West End river bank industrial area The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place demonstrates rare aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage, being the only surviving gas stripping tower in Australia. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

Under his leadership, the orphans were divided into two groups. The first group, composed of intellectually disabled children, was under the supervision of a caretaker and several nurses. Upon reaching 18 years of age the children from this group were further divided among specialised psychiatric hospitals. Children with other intellectual disabilities were put in the second group, where they would receive a specialized educational program developed by Rossolimo. The basis of the programme was manufacturing, although other subjects were included. In addition, the shelter studied the nervous systems of the child-patients.

Given a graph G, an initial state of tokens is defined by a subset V \\\\subset V(G) of the vertices of the graph; let n = V. Moving a token from vertex v_1 to vertex v_2 is valid if v_1 and v_2 are joined by a path in G that does not contain any other tokens; note that the distance traveled within the graph is inconsequential, and moving a token across multiple edges sequentially is considered a single move. A desired end state is defined as another subset V' \\\\subset V(G). The goal is to minimize the number of valid moves to reach the end state from the initial state.  Motivation  The problem is motivated by so-called sliding puzzles, which are in fact a variant of this problem, often restricted to rectangular grid graphs with no holes. The most famous such puzzle, the 15 puzzle, is a variant of this problem on a 4 by 4 grid graph such that n = V(G) - 1. One key difference between sliding block puzzles and the token reconfiguration problem is that in the original token reconfiguration problem, the tokens are indistinguishable. As a result, if the graph is connected, the token reconfiguration problem is always solvable; this is not necessarily the case for sliding block puzzles.  Complexity  Calinescu, Dumitrescu, and Pach have shown several results regarding both the optimization and approximation of this problem on various types of graphs. = Optimization = Firstly, reducing to the case of trees, there is always a solution in at most n moves, with at most one move per token. Furthermore, an optimal solution can be found in time linear in the size of the tree. Clearly, the first result extends to arbitrary graphs; the latter does not. A sketch of the optimal algorithm for trees is as follows. First, we obtain an algorithm that moves each node exactly once, which may not be optimal. Do this recursively: consider any leaf of the smallest tree in the graph containing both the initial and desired sets. If a leaf of this tree is in both, remove it and recurse down. If a leaf is in the initial set only, find a path from it to a vertex in the desired set that does not pass through any other vertices in the desired set. Remove this path (it'll be the last move), and recurse down. The other case, where the leaf is in the desired set only, is symmetric. To extend to an algorithm that achieves the optimum, consider any token in both the initial and desired sets. If removing it would split the graph into subtrees, all of which have the same number of elements from the initial and desired sets, then do so and recurse. If there is no such token, then each token must move exactly once, and so the solution that moves all tokens exactly once must be optimal. While the algorithm for finding the optimum on trees is linear time, finding the optimum for general graphs is NP-complete, a leap up in difficulty. It is in NP; the certificate is a sequence of moves, which is at most linear size, so it remains to show the problem is NP-hard as well. This is done via reduction from set cover. Consider an instance of set cover, where we wish to cover all elements v_1, v_2, \\\\ldots, v_n in a universe U using subsets S_1, S_2, \\\\ldots, S_m of U using the minimum number of subsets. Construct a graph as follows: Make a vertex for each of the elements in the universe and each of the subsets. Connect a subset vertex to an element vertex if the subset contains that element. Create a long path of size n, and attach one end to every subset vertex. The initial set is the added path plus every subset vertex, and the final set is every subset vertex plus every element vertex. To see why this is a reduction, consider the selection of which subset vertex tokens to move. Clearly, we must open up paths to each of the element vertices, and we do so by moving some of the subset vertex tokens. After doing so, each token on the long path must move once. Thus, the optimum cost is equal to the number of selected subsets plus the number of elements (the latter of which is notably a constant). So we have a polynomial-time reduction from set cover, which is NP- complete, to token reconfiguration. Thus token reconfiguration is also NP- complete on general graphs. = Approximation = The token reconfiguration problem is APX-complete, meaning that in some sense, it is as hard to approximate as any problem that has a constant-factor approximation algorithm. The reduction is the same one as above, from set cover. However, the set cover problem is restricted to subsets of size at most 3, which is an APX-hard problem. Using exactly the same structure as above, we obtain an L-reduction, as the distance of any solution from optimum is equal between the set cover instance and the transformed token reconfiguration problem. The only change is the addition of the number of elements in the universe. Furthermore, the set cover optimum is at least 1/3 of the number of elements, due to the bounded subset size. Thus, the constants from the L-reduction are \\\\alpha = 1/4, \\\\beta = 1. One can, in fact, modify the reduction to work for labeled token reconfiguration as well. To do so, attach a new vertex to each of the subset vertices, which is neither an initial nor desired vertex. Label the vertices on the long path 1 through n, and do the same for the element vertices. Now, the solution consists of 'moving aside' each chosen subset vertex token, correctly placing the labeled vertices from the path, and returning the subset vertex tokens to the initial locations. This is an L-reduction with \\\\alpha = 1/5, \\\\beta = 2. Calinescu, Dumitrescu, and Pach have also shown that there exists a 3-approximation for unlabeled token reconfiguration, so the problem is in APX as well and thus APX-complete. The proof is much more complicated and omitted here.

Santo Ni√±o, Hagonoy, Bulacan, Philippines. The parish church, under the aegis of Saint Anne, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos. It was declared a National Shrine in 1991. In 1981, a marker bearing a brief history of the church was installed on the church by the National Historical Institute, precursor of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. History =Parish History= Sources tell that Hagonoy was already a thriving community before the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries with claims that the local chieftain of prehistoric Hagonoy, along with the chieftains of Betis and Macabebe, confronted Miguel Lopez de Legazpi during their conquest of Manila in 1571. As for the beginnings of the Catholic institution in the town, Hagonoy was said to have been established as a visita of Calumpit as early as 1581 when Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pe√±alosa, then Governor General of the Philippines, handed over Hagonoy to Sargento Juan Moron to be included in Encomienda of Calumpit. Juan Moron later handed over his jurisdiction over Hagonoy to Fray Diego de Ordo√±ez de Vivar and the priest establish Hagonoy as one of the visitas of Convento de Calumpit. Proof of the establishment of the visita of Hagonoy can be found on the documents from a private meeting of the Augustinian dated January 17, 1582, with Fray Diego Ordo√±ez de Vivar as signatory for Hagonoy. Another meeting on September 21 of the same year 1582, confirms the existence of the convent of Hagonoy with Fray Diego Vivar as its first minister. =Edifice History= Fray Diego Ordo√±ez de Vivar erected parochial structures made of lights materials in barrio Quinabalon (now Barangay Santa Monica) and placed it under the guidance of Saint Anne. From 1731 to 1734, a stone and brick church was built by Fray Juan Albarr√†n, possibly still on the Brgy. Santa Monica site. The said church was razed by fire in August 12, 1748. As for the present church, its foundations were laid in 1747 on its current site in Barrio Sto Ni√±o during the time of Fray Eusebio Polo. The site was moved to its present location due to flooding on the former site. Fray Buenaventura Rold√°n completed the church in 1752. Another church was said to have been built from 1815 to 1836 by Fray Juan Coronado. The said church was razed by fire in 1856, which also damaged 30 houses in the town center. Fray Manuel Alvarez, appointed as parish priest in 1862, started building another church, bigger than the previous ones to accommodate a larger number of people. Besides the expansion of the church, its design was also remodeled into one that was described as unique for that era. The church walls were partially damaged by an earthquake in 1871, and repairs followed soon after it under the leadership of Fray Ignacio Manzanares. Secular priest from Archidiocese of Manila has started to administered the church in 1900 upon the evacuation of Augustinian order due to Filipino Revolution against Spain. Church renovations were done in 1936 and 1961 (the year when the porte-cochere was added by Father Celestino Rodriquez). Gradual renovations continued from 1968 to 1970 under Monsignor Jose B. Aguinaldo. The present fa√ßade, with the predominant images of saint resting atop the pilasters is attributed to him. Architecture Prior to the Mid-20th century renovation, the church fa√ßade is bare of ornamentation save for volutes founds on the end of the imaginary triangular pediment, circular reliefs and buttress-like pilasters capped with roof tiles. The fa√ßade is pierced with 5 windows: three semicircular arched ones and two rectangular ones on the first level. A porte-cochere with a balustraded top mars the view of the bottom part of the fa√ßade. Much of the design of the fa√ßade has been changed after the 1970s renovation. The fa√ßade now sports three arched entrances, all featuring hardwood doors carved with great details. Tuscan capitals were incorporated into the four pilasters and were now capped off with huge images of Augustinian saints. A rose window and a tableau of Saint Anne and the Virgin Mary were also added into the center of the pediment. The entire fa√ßade is capped off with a cross held by two cherubs. To the left of the church rises the six-level rectangular bell tower. Originally a five level tower, a sixth level and a cupola was added during the latest reconstruction of the church. The bell tower is bare of detailed ornamentation except for the balustraded semicircular arch windows and buttresses placed at the corners of the tower.

It was originally built as a private residence for the owner of a local paper mill. The estate covers 30 hectares of parkland and forest and borders Hornb√¶k Golf Course. History The village of Havreholm is first mentioned in 1178 as Hauerholm. In 1497, it consisted of six farms. In 1681, it consisted of six farms and three houses and in 1747 of six farms and seven houses. The adjacent Gurre Stream was from at least the 16th century used for milling. A water mill is mentioned in 1555 and was later and until 1817 used as a sharpening mill in association with the small arms factory in Helleb√¶k. Johan Thomas Culmsee established a water and steam powered paper mill at the site in 1842. His son Frederik L. Culmsee later took over the factory. The writer and painter Holger Drachmann, a friend of his son Valdemar, visited the house in 1866. He entered into a relationship with his daughter Polly and later married his daughter Emmy. Emmy Drachmann's novel Inger (1910) is a fictional account of their marriage which she has also described in her memoir. Havreholm Slot Valdemar Culmsee took over the management of the paper mill when his father moved to Kristiania with the rest of the family in 1756. He replaced the old house with the current main building in 1872. It was built to an opulent Historicist design which soon gave it the name \\"Slottet\\" (The Castle\\") among the locals. Henrik Pontoppidan rented the house in 1886 and his son was born there the following year. The paper factory closed in 1889. The buildings were then used for producing wooden products but the factory burned in 1897 and was later rebuilt in a more strategic location near Kvistgaard railway station. All remains of the industrial buildings were removed in 1910. The residence remained unaffected by the fire. In 1911, it was purchased by Holger Jantzen, the owner of a sugar factory on Java. He expanded the property through the acquisition of more land and laid out a large park. The Jantzen family owned Havreholm House for 70 years.In the 1980s, a company had plans to convert the property into a country club. They renovated the main building and upgraded the facilities before abandoning their plans in 1989. The new owner, Inge Correll , backed up by an insurance company as investor, converted the property into a hotel. The hotel went bankrupt in 2009. It subsequently reopened with new owners. Interior Holger Jantzen commissioned Joakim Skovgaard to decorate Garden Hall. He created six large and six smaller murals, depicting the Genesis creation narrative. It took Skovgaard three years to complete the works which were exhibited at Den Frie Udstilling, Charlottenborg and in Stockholm prior to their installation in Havreholm. The ceiling is decorated with the 12 signs of the Zodiac surrounded by figures representing the four seasons. Further reading * Alkj√¶r, Ejler: Nogle tr√¶k af Havreholm Papirfabriks historie.

In Nepal, it is known as Banjhi, Rainj, Khasarant, Tikhe bhanjh in Standard Nepali and Sulsing in Tamang language. Some authors named it as Quercus incana Roxburgh. Description Quercus leucotrichophora is an evergreen tree bearing stalked, ovate to lancolate, acuminate, serrate, leathery, and dark green leaves which are glabrous above and densely white or gray pubescent beneath. Male flowers are slender and drooping spikes. Female spikes are sessile and axillary. An acorn is solitary. Phenology and reproduction Quercus leucotrichophora flowers in April to May and fruits in December. Naturally, it regenerates via seeds. Ecology and distribution Quercus leucotrichophora is distributed in Northern India, Nepal, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In Nepal, it naturally occurs at 1500‚Äì2700 m in forested areas in association with Rhododendron arboreum., Lyonia ovalifolia, Myrica esculenta. On south facing slopes and disturbed areas it forms associations with Chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) Uses and economic value The Banj oak is among the most useful trees of the Himalaya. It is extensively lopped (or branch pruned) for fuelwood and its wood has a high calorific value and good burning properties. The leaves are extensively used as a cattle fodder. Leaf litter is rich in Nitrogen and makes an excellent compost fertilizer. The timber while hard and strong, and used for agricultural implements is not particularly valuable as it is hard to work. Habitat value The tree is affected with many types of leaf galls caused by different types of insects. Many Cecidomyiidae genera such as Asphondylia, Lasioptera and Dasineura are known to cause plant galls. An unknown Itonididae (cecidomyiid) caused pouch leaf galls on the tree.Mishra, P., and V.

He is a great proponent of Grant Lewi, considered as the father of modern astrology in America. Lewi's Philosophy of Life is that Destiny, when multiplied by Free will, creates Human life, which normally appears as a constant struggle between what is (Existence) and what ought (Essence) to be. Knowledge about Horoscope gives a glimpse into Destiny and allows for prospective planning of Free will (alternatives and choices) to create the best possible conditions of Human Life.

He was the son of the Eshnunna king Ipiq-Adad II (reigned c. 1862‚Äì1818 BC). Although previously kings of Eshnunna had referred to themselves as ensi (governor) of the city god Tishpak, in the early 19th century rulers of Eshnunna began referring to themselves as King (Sumerian lugal). Dadusha‚Äôs father Ipiq-Adad II and his brother Naram-Suen (reigned c. 1818‚Äì? BC), who ruled Eshnunna before him, both used the title king and Dadusha followed suit. Ipiq-Adad II extended the control of Eshnunna to incorporate other cities in the Diyala Valley, including Nerebtum, Shaduppum, and Dur-Rimush. Dadusha followed the expansionist policies of his father and his brother Naram-Suen, mixing war and diplomacy to increase his control over areas. His continued expansionism caused Eshnunna to become one of the most powerful states in the Mesopotamian region in the early 18th century. Dadusha was succeeded by his son Ibal pi‚Äôel II (reigned c. 1779‚Äì65 BC).  Stele of Dadusha  In 1781 BC, Dadusha joined forces with the king of Upper Mesopotamia, Shamshi-Adad, in order to subdue the area between the two Zab Rivers. They were successful in this endeavor, and Dadusha had a victory stele commissioned commemorating the event. The stele is an elongated stone monument which originally stood at the Temple of Adad at Eshnunna. The front side is carved with four registers while the narrow sides were inscribed with 220 lines of a cuneiform text divided into 17 columns; 180 cm high, 37 cm wide and 18,5 cm thick. The stele was found accidentally in 1983 while digging out a well in the outskirts of the ancient Eshnunna (modern-day Tell Asmar) in Diyala Governorate, Iraq. The center of the front side was damaged during the discovery. The upper register (the image of heroism) shows Dadudha (left) in a position of a slayer, tending on the defeated and slain King of Qabara, Banu- Ishtar. A standing male figure (right) adores Dadusha; this is probably a crown-prince or a military general. The sun-disc with its rays of Shamash, combined with the crescent of Sin, appears at the central upper part. At the bottom of the image, the city walls of Qabara appear. This stele commemorates his victory over the city of Qabara in Arbela (modern-day Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan) and its king Banu-Ishtar, with the help of king Shamshi-Adad (also Shamshi-Addu) of Ekallatum. The stele dates back to the Old-Babylonian period, c. 1800-1779 BC. It is on display at the Old-Babylonian Gallery of the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, Republic of Iraq. During the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and subsequent ransacking of the Iraq Museum in April 2003, the stele escaped looting and vandalism.

He is generally counted as the forty-third in the list of 63 Nayanars. His hagiography speaks about how he cut the hand of his wife, who did not help in serving a Shaiva, devotee of the god Shiva. Life The primary account of Kalikamba Nayanar's life comes from the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Kalikamba Nayanar was born and lived in Pennagadam (Pennakatam/Pennakadam), also known as Tirupennagadam (Thirupennagadam), currently situated near Virudhachalam in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is famous for Sudarkozhundeesar Temple, dedicated to the god Shiva, the patron god of Shaivism. In Kalikamba Nayanar's times, Pennagadam was part of the Chola kingdom. Kalikamba was a Vaishya, the merchant caste that flourished in Pennagadam. He was a devotee of Shiva and used to serve the devotees of Shiva (Shaivas). Every day, he welcomed them, washed their feet, and worshipped them. He also served lunch to the devotees and offered them money and gifts. Once, when the devotees gathered for lunch at Kalikamba's house, he started with his daily ritual of pada-puja (washing of feet to show respect) of the devotees. His wife helped him in the service. The wife would pour water from the pot, as Kalikamba washed the feet. When Kalikamba was about to wash the feet of a devotee, she recognised the devotee as their former servant and hesitated from pouring water from the pot. Kalikamba felt that the wife has desecrated the sacred service. He took the pot from her hand and cut off the hand by his sword. He continued to wash the feet of the devotees and served them food, a duty generally performed by his wife. For his act of devotion, he attained the grace of Shiva. The tale of Kalikamba Nayanar is also recalled in the 13th-century Telugu Basava Purana of Palkuriki Somanatha with some variation. The devotee is recognized the son of their servant Mallandu or Malla. He had refused to serve Kalikamba and left Kalikamba's house and become a Shaiva mendicant. The wife refuses to serve a son of a slave and advises her husband not to do so, however Kalikamba considers every Shaiva as a manifestation of Shiva and refuses to pour water to wash his feet. Kalikamba considers this as an insult of Shiva and cuts both her hands as a punishment. The account ends by saying that Kalikamba attained moksha (salvation) by the grace of Shiva. Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Kalikamba Nayanar receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals.

He studied the I Ching from Confucius, and is credited with the preservation and transmission of the classic. Life Shang Qu was born in 522 BC, 29 years younger than Confucius. He was born in the State of Lu, Confucius' native state. According to the Shiben, he was a descendant of the Shang dynasty nobility, hence his surname Shang. According to the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji), Shang Qu was responsible for the preservation of the I Ching, which he received from Confucius. The Shiji records the transmission of the I Ching, step by step, from Shang Qu to his disciple Han Bi (È¶ØËáÇ), down to Yang He (Êù®‰Ωï) of the Han dynasty. Yang He served as an official in the court of Emperor Wu of Han (reigned 156‚Äì87 BC) because of his knowledge of the I Ching. Legends Little is known about Shang Qu's life, but several legends have later developed about him. According to one legend, Shang Qu did not have a son when he approached the age of 40. His mother was worried, but Confucius told her that Shang Qu would have five sons after turning 40, which became true. In another legend, Shang Qu performed divination which predicted that Confucius would die at noon of that day. Upon hearing this, Confucius asked his disciples to bring his books, so he could read until noon. Honours In Confucian temples, Shang Qu's spirit tablet is placed in the outer court, beyond those of the Four Assessors and Twelve Wise Ones, and after that of Nangong Kuo. During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously awarded Shang Qu the nobility title of Count of Meng (Ëíô‰ºØ).

He was born in Hannapes, Ardennes on March 7, 1806. After his ordination on 1 June 1833, he served as pastor in Remaucourt, Aisne and Logny-l√®s-Chaumont (now a part of Chaumont-Porcien). In 1834 he served in Librecy. He joined the Seminary of Paris Foreign Missions on May 4, 1839. He was sent to Pondicherry, India on January 6, 1840. In India Coming to India he served in Tanjore, Kovilur in Dharmapuri District, Tranquabar and also in Karaikal. He became the rector of the Petit Seminaire in Pondicherry and served for five years from 1846 to 1850. The caste Catholics had viewed the decision of the Synod of Pondicherry with regard to the admissions to Petit Seminaire as a veiled threat to the caste system. Tamil news papers from Madras carried letters and articles condemning the acts of the priests. The seminary authorities declared indefinite holidays and the seminary was closed. Normalcy returned only in April 1847 with the intervention of Mgr. Bonnand. As a Bishop He was appointed as the Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic of Pondicherry on 3 April 1857. He was ordained a Bishop by Ordained Bishop Mgr. Bonnand on 27 August 1857 at Karoumatampatty, Coimbatore with Thermopylae as his titular see. He was simultaneously appointed as an administrator of Coimbatore. When Mgr. Bonnand was appointed as the apostolic visitor of the missions of India and set off for his apostolic visitation in November 1859, Godelle took charge of the mission of Pondicherry. He succeeded Bonnand as the Vicar Apostolic on March 21, 1861 after the death of the prelate, while remaining an administrator of Coimbatore. He remained in this additional post until 1865 the Vicariate of Coimbatore was entrusted to Bishop Depommier. Death In 1867, the Catholic bishops of the world were invited to Rome to solemnize the 18th centenary of the martyrdom of Saints Peter and Paul and to attend the canonization of Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan. Mgr. Godelle, accompanied by Mgr. Charbonnaux, went to Rome. At the end of the celebrations they met the Pope in private audience and started their return journey. During that journey Mgr. Godelle fell ill and he was taken by Mgr.Charbonnaux to Chamb√©ry, where he was admitted in the general hospital, since Mgr. Godelle refused to seek hospitality from the Archbishop of Chamb√©ry on account of his austerity and simplicity. He asked Mgr.Charbonnaux to proceed to India while he remained alone in the hospital, in the company of a missionary from China. On 15 July 1867 he received the last sacraments in the presence of Cardinal Alexis Billiet, the Archbishop of Chamb√©ry, and died that day. He was buried in the graveyard of Chamb√©ry and a monument was erected in the Cathedral. On 14 August 1867, a solemn service was held for him at Pondicherry which was attended by all the members of the government and at which military honours were rendered. In 1870 around the cemetery chapel a vault was prepared to bury clergymen including Mgr. Godelle. His remains were later transferred to the cathedral.

Many popular representations of rurality as well as anti-LGBTQIA+ discourse citing \\"protecting rural values\\" suggest these communities intrinsically place a heightened value on ‚Äútraditional moral standards.‚Äù Thus, communities in rural areas are associated with a lower tolerance for difference (including non-binary gender expression and queer sexuality) compared to urban environments. Some queer-identified individuals living in rural areas do experience antagonism, oppression, and violence matching the stereotypical representation of what it means to be queer in a rural community. As of 2000, the U.S. Census found that 46 million people (roughly 16% of the nation's total population) live in ares with population densities of 999 people per square mile or fewer. Considering the high number of individuals and the small population densitity, the rural population of the U.S. exists across a wide geographical area. Despite the categorization based upon population density, \\"the rural population is not the same everywhere except in its distinction of not being urban.\\" The variation within the category of rural is reflected in the multiple, varied experiences of queer- identified people living in rural areas. In popular depictions, rurality is often portrayed as an inherently incompatible, or even hostile, environment for individuals who are not heterosexual and/or cisgender. While this may be an accurate contrast between some urban and rural settings, there is significant variation within each categorization based on population density. Patricia Nell Warren's third novel, The Fancy Dancer (1976), was the first bestseller to explore gay life in a small town and to portray a gay priest.  Rural/urban dichotomy and visibility politics in the United States  Queer regionalist scholars such as Mary Gray have illustrated that organizing for LGBTQIA+ issues in the post-Stonewall U.S. has centered around a politics of visibility. Within this political framework, publicly claiming a minority sexual orientation is viewed as inherently political. Visibility politics claim that, by making one's own queerness visible, 'out' individuals resist heteronormativity and the erasure of non-heterosexual behaviors and identities as well as illustrate to their local, national, and global communities that queer people exist and need equal rights and protection under the law. Therefore, visibility politics view a public declaration of queer identity as the primary road to political liberation and equality for queer communities. Visibility politics also creates an understanding of queer lives through the metaphor of the closet (which Eve Sedgwick terms the epistemology of the closet). Within the epistemology of the closet framework, LGBTQIA+ persons are born 'in the closet' or with a repressed sexuality until the catalytic moment of 'coming out' at which point they become 'out' or publicly queer. Regional scholars have argued that the reliance upon the epistemology of the closet and visibility politics within U.S. queer activism is urban-centric, excluding and erasing LGBTQIA+ individuals and communities in rural areas across the globe. As the majority of national-scale queer activism reliant on visibility politics within the U.S. emerged from its major cities, this ideology was \\"tailor-made for and from the population densities; capital; and systems of gender, sexual, class, and racial privilege that converge in cities.\\" Mary Gray expands upon this point in her book, Out in the Country: Youth, Media, and Queer Visibility in Rural America: > \\"...\\"metronormative\\" epistemologies of visibility privilege urban queer > scenes. The systemic marginalization of the rural as endemically hostile and > lacking the cultural milieu necessary for a celebratory politics of > difference naturalizes cities as the necessary centers and standard bearers > of queer politics and representations. Along the way all those not able, or > inclined, to migrate to the city are put at a notable disadvantage not just > by the material realities of rural places but also by the shortcoming of > queer theory and LGBT social movement in ways we have only recently begun to > explore.\\" U.S. scholarship on queer life within metropoles further perpetuates the centrality of metronormative narratives of queer life and identity. John D'Emilio proposed a contradictory connection between capitalism and homosexuality. He argued that capitalism emphasized the importance of family units and reproduction as the primary function of that unit. However, simultaneously the anonymity of U.S. cities, a product of capitalist development, enabled networks of same-sex desiring individuals to form and a homosexual community and shared identity to emerge. George Chauncey is another historian whose work centered on queer life in urban centers. His book Gay New York examined how gay life in New York City formed around patterns of congregation and habit. Both D'Emilio and Chauncey highlight the ways that urban environments distinctly, and possibly uniquely, enable queerness. Thus, their findings to some extent reinforce a binary view of urban/rural wherein urban is perceived as a space for liberated, 'out' queer communities while rural is a space for isolated, 'closeted' queer individuals. Studies and fieldwork by contemporary scholars prove the existence of queer lives in rural areas and challenge a systemic erasure of non-urban queer life. In particular, scholars of the American South and Midwest have written on queer life in rural areas, challenging the belief that rurality is inherently not conducive to queer sexual expression. The presence of LGBTQ bars, bookstores, and neighborhoods within population-dense, urban areas makes the presence of queer individuals and communities more visible than in less populated areas; however, queer-identified individuals can also be found living in both densely and sparsely populated communities all around the world. Research on migration patterns between urban and rural areas also challenges a binary view of the two categories as well as the common narrative that queer-identifying individuals 'escape' to the city over the course of their lives. In Coming Out and Coming Back: Rural Gay Migration and the City, authors Meredith Redlin and Alexis Annes' find that the migratory flow between urban and rural is not unidirectional, but rather a series of movements over time between the two spaces. Their essay illustrates how queer individuals move within and between rural and urban areas in response to the ways that each space limits and/or enables their identity formation and sexual expression. Rural queer lifestyle In rural areas, the heterosexual family unit is valued as an essential part of life. It is the overtly dominant lifestyle in these spaces, which makes being queer a different experience than one would have in a metropolitan area. Masculine and feminine gender representations operate differently for those in rural areas because work done by both genders is perceived as masculine behavior in other non-rural areas. Both men and women can exhibit masculine features and be perceived as normal. Many rural women work alongside men on farms or in construction work, thus certain types of masculinity displayed by rural women are not interpreted as lesbian behavior as they might be in an urban or suburban environment. As a result of female gender representations being more masculine for women in rural spaces, femininity operates very differently there, and thus so does lesbianism. This masculine dynamic allows for some lesbians to blend in quite easily, where typical female attire can be wearing flannels and cowboy boots. However, deviations in style, such as short hair or wearing ties, can still result in judgment from the woman's surrounding community. Emily Kayzak notes that ‚Äúthe sexual identity of rural butch lesbian women is not invisible in urban lesbian cultures, their more butch gender presentations do not do the same work in rural areas because those gender presentations are also tied to normative (hetero)sexuality.‚Äù Generally, lesbian-butch women are compatible with rural lifestyles as long as they can fit in with the typical masculine-female appearance. Rural spaces have even been referred to as makings for ‚Äúlesbian lands,‚Äù in part due to their ability to blend in. In the 1970s, women began to move to agricultural communes where they could live and work with other ‚Äúcountry women‚Äù. In these communities, lesbian women built communes where they grew their own food and created societies away from men. They believed that living and working in nature allowed them to embrace their inherent connection with nature. Gay men also partook in similar activities; Bell and Valentine note how the Edward Carpenter Community in England hosts Gay Men's Weeks where they conduct events related to free-spiritedness and the embracement of one's sexuality. For rural men, on the other hand, ‚Äúpublicly disrupting normative gender expectations arguably remains as, if not more, contentious than homoerotic desires.‚Äù In many places, as long as a gay man subscribes to masculine representations and activities, such as wearing traditionally masculine attire and working in manual labor, acceptance comes much more easily. Deviations in appearance, like dressing up in drag, would be seen as very unacceptable, and can result in harassment. Male effeminate expressions and rurality are generally seen as incompatible. Many gay men in rural communities reject femininity and embrace masculine roles. Feminine gays typically face persecution and disapproval from their community members. Queer individuals in rural areas, as in many other places, face discrimination and violence. In small rural areas, perpetrators and victims are typically both known to the surrounding community. Even police, who are intended to hold up the law, are known to commit crimes against sexually marginalized people. Brett Beemyn's review of John Howard's piece \\"Men Like That: A Southern Queer History\\" explains some of the roots of violent hate crimes and discrimination against queer people. In the 1960s, amongst the acrimony of racists was the tendency to depict African Americans as sexual deviants. In addition, during the civil rights movement African Americans were known to have queer allies, thus stereotypes of racial justice supporters as engagers in perverted sexual acts became prevalent in the 1960s and the focus of discrimination spread to include queer individuals in a more direct manner. In contrast, queer urbanites have gained much more acceptance and visibility as a result of gay rights movements and the recognition of the potential of the queer economy. Acceptance of queerness is also much more common in suburban and urban communities, because there is a higher acceptance of diversity in general. All cities have recognized, visible gay neighborhoods. Gay couples are more likely to live in urban areas than are lesbian couples, as the urban setting can be much more conducive to gay culture and life. Amongst those with higher income or education, acceptance is also more prevalent. These two points have led to an increase of the migration of queer people from rural communities to metropolitan areas. The cost of moving to a city filters out some with lower incomes, creating a class bias for those who are more affluent. Yet discrimination from community members, local police, and even state governments still occurs in urban spheres, although cities typically maintain a relative liberalism. Assumptions made about queer rural spaces are sometimes crude. In media, rustic sexual expression can take the form of homosexual rape, as seen in Pulp Fiction and Deliverance, and bestiality, which is also a theme in these films. After James Michael Taitt died after paying to be anally penetrated by a male horse, bestiality became linked to country happenings, and induced a nationwide ‚Äúbizarre sex panic.‚Äù Heterosexual activities that are not heteronormative become contextually queer activities, some of which take place in rural areas, because they are viewed as a place to retreat and sexually experiment. Practicing ‚Äúdogging‚Äù occurs, in which people can engage in public sex, voyeurism, exhibitionism, swinging, group sex, or partner swapping. Quiet roadsides and rest areas make for private places to meet, making cars vital for maintaining heterosexual and non-heterosexual queer interactions as well. Rural queer farmers Other communities of queer farmers prefer to live a more conventional lifestyle with a house and agricultural land of their own. The documentary Out Here portrays the lives of many rural queer people across the United States, and it shows how many queer people make a living and are making a difference in their communities through agriculture. The documentary's creators also provide many biographies about queer farmers on their blog. The farmers documented have a wide variety of experiences, from being a specialty cattle farmer to an urban community gardener at a non-profit. The farmers surveyed state that they feel that farming provides a place where it is free to experiment, and is a place where queers naturally belong. They also describe the discrimination that they have faced throughout their agricultural careers, from social isolation to having fungicide dropped on them in the field. Farmers and Friends, a helpline for closeted gay farmers in England, was created to help farmers deal with discrimination and to provide emotional support. Many closeted queer farmers risk being outed by their communities, which could lead to loss of their livelihoods and community ties. The eco-queer movement aims to draw attention to the intersectionality of nature and sexuality.Sbicca, Joshua. (2012). Eco- queer movement(s) Challenging Heteronormative Space through (Re)imagining Nature and Food European Journal of Ecopsychology, Volume3, pp .33-52 Part of this intersectionality is the reason why many queer individuals may not feel comfortable in a rural setting due to the population dynamics that generally occur in these areas, which mainly consist of straight, middle-class, white men. Because of this, many queer farmers have taken to growing food in urban environments so that they can be agricultural while maintaining their queer lifestyles.  Queer rural political activism in the United States  Many queer political organizers believe reform is more difficult to pass in rural communities that are less tolerant of queer lifestyles. It is harder to mobilize communities in rural spaces where queer populations are less dense and financial contributions are limited. This has led to a divestment in formal rural queer political organizing. Because political activism has been silent in rural communities, many Americans assume rural queer people do not exist, or that they only do so only before moving to more urban and accepting communities. This assumption has created a misrepresentation of the US queer population. US Census data shows that 66% of South Dakotan same-sex households were located outside of urban areas. Queer communities exist outside urban areas, although they are generally less visible. A lack of visibility and political attention has left queer people more vulnerable to institutional discrimination. Compared to the heterosexual population, they have reduced access to housing and healthcare and face greater employment discrimination. In South Dakota, only 29% of rural same-sex households own homes, compared to 84% of married heterosexual couples. There are generally fewer community resources and support groups for queer individuals in rural areas, as more limited local resources do not facilitate their existence. Legislation often neglects rural queer populations, leaving them without protection under the law. In a 2006 custody case, a mother found herself unfit to care for her child and relinquished rights to a queer caretaker. Once the new guardian's sexuality was discovered the court ruled against the biological mother's request, stating that \\"the adoption would not be in the best interest of the child.\\" The court used rurality in their reasoning to reject the request, citing \\"stigma that the child may face growing up in a small, rural town with two women, in whose case she was placed at the age of six, who openly engage in a homosexual relationship.\\" The court found the state of Georgia a more fit guardian than a rural queer couple. Despite similar cases, many fights in rural areas are won in state courtrooms. The Iowa Supreme Court struck down the state's defense of marriage statute, which made it one of the first states to allow same-sex marriage, affecting the predominantly rural population. This action was met with political resistance. The Iowa electorate voted to not retain all three judges, marking the first time in Iowa's history that a judge had not been retained since 1961. Many rural politicians have cited their reluctance to come out in support of same-sex marriage, for fear of similar political repercussions. Representative Paul Davis, the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Kansas, voted against a constitutional ban on same- sex marriage three times in the state legislature, but did not take a definitive stance on the issue in his run for governor. More liberal and urban districts can offer public officials a politically safe place to take stances on issues that are not popular in predominantly rural states. In recent years, the country has seen a shift in national public opinion on queer issues, which has spread to rural communities. In 2006, 71 Wisconsin counties voted to ban same-sex marriage, while only one county voted against the ban. Opinion has since overwhelmingly shifted. According to a 2014 poll by Marquette Law School, only 35% of voters in the Green Bay media market, a predominantly conservative area, still support the marriage ban, compared to 65% of the population in 2006. Queer visibility plays a critical role in political activism, though this has not been a viable strategy for many rural queer people. Being openly queer can lead to more discrimination and isolation in rural spaces. Rural queer individuals have had to reimagine how to make political and social progress in their communities. New digital media has opened more political options for rural queer people. Social media is a means to expand local communities and allow rural queer individuals to take part in a larger queer community. Access to queer people's experiences are available on blogs and websites and provide access to the terminology needed to describe and understand their experiences. New media can give rural queer individuals the political tools and connections to make changes in their own communities.

The law is named for its two primary sponsors, Daisy Elliott, a Democrat from Detroit, and Melvin L. Larsen, a Republican from Oxford, and passed in 1976 with 25 votes in the Michigan Senate and 79 votes in the Michigan House of Representatives. It was signed into law by Michigan Governor William Milliken on January 13, 1977 and went into effect on March 31, 1977. The law also helped strengthen the role of the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, formed in 1965 to support the work of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission of the 1963 Constitution of Michigan.  History  The Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act was passed in 1976, signed into law by Michigan Governor William Milliken on January 13, 1977, and went into effect on March 31, 1977. It has been amended directly or indirectly nearly 20 times. = Prior protections = In 1885, Michigan adopted the Public Act 130 of 1885, otherwise known as the Civil Rights Act, which stated ‚Äúall persons within the jurisdiction of (the state) shall be entitled to full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, eating-houses, barber shops, public conveyances on land and water, theatres, and all other places of public accommodation and amusement‚Äù. In 1890, the Michigan Supreme Court in Ferguson v. Gies relied on the Civil Rights Act in holding the ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù doctrine unconstitutional under Michigan law, over 60 years before the Supreme Court of the United States case of Brown v. Board of Education. In 1927, the Civil Rights Act survived constitutional challenge in Bolden v. Grand Rapids Operating Corporation. In the years following Bolden v. Grand Rapids Operating Corporation, Michigan passed additional civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations, housing, and employment. The progression of the state‚Äôs laws reached a new pinnacle when civil rights were given constitutional status in Michigan's Constitution of 1963, which also resulted in the formation of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. = Passage = After attempting in 1966 to pass a Michigan version of the federal civil rights law that was adopted in 1964, Michigan State Representative Daisy Elliott was told by the leadership of her political party, the Democrats, that her measure would never pass unless she found a Republican to co-sponsor it. After being newly elected, Michigan State Representative Melvin L. Larsen, a Republican from Oxford, indicated in 1973 that he would co-sponsor the law. Larsen served on the Michigan House of Representatives civil rights committee that would hold hearings and vote on the proposed legislation. Larsen has stated that his Catholic faith and experience as a principal, athletic director, football coach and instructor at one of the Pontiac Catholic schools was what motivated him to support anti-discrimination measures. The act was modeled on prior state civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and housing but considerably extended the reach of their application and broadened the forms of discrimination prohibited. When proposed by Elliott and Larsen in 1973, the legislation faced opposition from the disabled (referred to as \\"handicappers\\" at the time) and LGBT communities because it did not include protections for members of those communities. Elliott and Larsen indicated that the legislation was meant to focus on the African American community. When the bill passed three years later, it was believed that adding \\"sexual orientation\\" would prevent the bill from passing, so it was left out. Elliott and Larsen made the decision to proceed with the final bill after Elliott offered to add Larsen's name to the bill and consulted him on the final effort to pass the bill in 1976. Most issues raised by the disabled community were also addressed in 1976 with the passage of the Michigan‚Äôs Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act. It passed with 25 votes in the Michigan Senate and 79 votes in the Michigan House of Representatives, and was signed into law by Governor William Milliken on January 13, 1977. The law went into effect on March 31, 1977. = Effort to add protections for LGBT people = As early as the 1973 committee hearing on the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, members of the LGBT community in Michigan sought to be included in the law. In 1983, Republican state representative Jim Dressel co-sponsored House Bill 5000, which would have added \\"sexual orientation\\" to the list of protected characteristics; Dressel ‚Äì who later came out as gay ‚Äì was defeated for re-election the following year. Michigan's first openly LGBT state legislator, Chris Kolb, included such a change in two other pro-LGBT bills‚Äînone of which passed. Since then a number of additional bills have been introduced to add protections for the LGBT community. Most recently, a bill to add sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression was introduced by State Representative Sam Singh in 2014. Another bill which only included sexual orientation was also introduced by State Representative Frank Foster, but did not receive support from the LGBT community or progressives as the bill left out members of the transgender community and did not adequately protect lesbian, gay, or bisexual people from discrimination. Both bills received a hearing before the Michigan House Commerce Committee, but neither bill received a committee vote.  Amendments  The Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act has been amended directly or indirectly nearly 20 times to refine the law, its enforcement, and add protections for groups or classifications not originally named in the act such as height and weight. In 2009, Governor Jennifer Granholm signed Public Act 190 of 2009, an amendment that increased employment protections for pregnant workers. In 2019, legislation was introduced to expand the act by including sexual orientation & gender identity as protected classes.  Honors and recognition  The State Bar of Michigan recognized the law at the 37th Legal Milestone dedication on August 28, 2012, at the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing.

From 1988 to the present he has held positions as Assistant, Associate, and Research Professor at Polytechnic University in New York (now called NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, New York University). In 1995, Landau joined the faculty of the University of Haifa, where he founded the Department of Computer Science and was the first department head. In 2006, Landau was promoted to his current position of full Professor at the University of Haifa.  Research  Landau's research interests focus on string algorithms, data structures, computational biology, and parallel computation. He has made several profound contributions to these areas, even in the early days of his scientific career. His Ph.D. thesis, supervised by Prof. Uzi Vishkin, includes the fundamental text-book solution for the k-differences problem, solving one of the major open problems in the area at the time. His solution was the first to combine suffix trees and lowest common ancestor queries, and has since inspired many extensions of this technique to other problems. The footprints of Landau's research can be found in almost every subarea of string algorithms, including his foundational work on dynamic programming algorithms for the edit distance problem, his numerous papers on modeling digitized images and 2D matching, incremental sequence alignment, and recently, his work on jumbled pattern matching and compressed text algorithms. He was instrumental in the application of pattern matching techniques to the area of computational biology, working on problems in several diverse areas such as DNA and RNA comparison, clustering, haplotype inference, protein secondary structure prediction, and tandem repeats. Landau's research has been continually funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Israel Science Foundation, and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation. He received the IBM Faculty award, and was awarded funding from the DFG and Yahoo!. Landau co-chaired the International Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching in both 2001 and 2008. He serves on the editorial board of Journal of Discrete Algorithms, and served as a guest editor for TCS and Discrete Applied Mathematics. He has served on numerous program committees for international conferences, most recently, International Conference on Language and Automata Theory and Applications (LATA), International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval (SPIRE), International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC), Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching (CPM), Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI), International Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms (IWOCA), and Brazilian Symposium on Bioinformatics (BSB).  Academic activities  Landau has been an active member on academic committees, including committees that advise and supervise the academic activity in newly founded computer science departments in Israel. He founded several academic projects at the University of Haifa, most notably the Etgar undergraduate program for highly talented high school students throughout the north of Israel. Apart from these, Landau was also involved in community and civic activities, and served as a member of the Haifa city council from 2008 until 2013.:he:Special:PermanentLink/15964007  References   External links  * Personal Website * * Category:Israeli bioinformaticians Category:Israeli computer scientists Category:University of Haifa faculty Category:Living people Category:Tel Aviv University alumni Category:1954 births ","title":"Gad Landau"},{"id":"44646352","text":"Mary Mei Loc Wu (Chinese: Âê≥ÁæéÊ®Ç), also known as Mary Wu, is a Chinese classical pianist, now based in Hong Kong.

It states that seers living in the celestial regions should be known as the blessed Devarishis, and also those who are distinguished by their knowledge of the past, present and future and strict adherence to truth; they are the revealers of Mantra and by virtue of their Siddhis ('supernatural powers') have unrestricted access everywhere.

Longos, Balagtas, Bulacan, Philippines. The parish church, dedicated to Saint Lawrence, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos. History =Parish History= Balagtas, originally referred to as Caruya and later renamed to Bigaa by the mid-1600s, was accepted by the Augustinian Friars as a convent under the patronage of Saint Lawrence on May 12, 1596. Father Francisco de Campos and Father Andres de Cordoba were named priests of Balagtas the same year. The convent of Guiguinto was frequently annexed to the convent of Balagtas due to the former‚Äôs poor economic status. Guiguinto was first annexed to Balagtas in 1607. By 1612, Balagtas was reported to be an independent with two visitas and 2,400 parishioners. Its catchment population decreased when one of its barrio- visita, Casay, separated to form a new parish. In 1639, Balagtas was declared a vicariate. =Architectural History= History tells that Balagtas had its first parochial structures made of light materials long before 1645, the year when it was reported to have sustained heavy damage from an earthquake. The convent of Balagtas must have experience financial instability since it was reported that it took the priests of Balagtas months before the structures can be repaired. The exact date of the construction of the present church cannot be pointed out clearly although some sources suggest that it was built a few years after 1805, the year when a church was reportedly built on Balagtas‚Äô former town site, now known as Bigaang Matanda. Father Manuel Buceta, minister of Balagtas in 1738, 1751 and 1754 repaired the church and built a new convent. Another earthquake damaged the church in 1880. Between 1893 and 1898, the church and convent was repaired, the bell tower was erected under the supervision of Father Francisco Martin Giron. The church underwent series of renovations especially in the early 1960s. Architecture The most striking features of the church fa√ßade are the recessed arch dominating much of the front of the church and the absence of pilasters dividing the fa√ßade into several segments. Above and beside the arch are semicircular arch windows and a rose window that allow the entry of light to the choir loft inside. The two semicircular arch windows also act as niches holding figures of angels. The entire fa√ßade has been plastered with cement and was laid out with patterns mimicking the original stone wall.

It is also known as South Brisbane Gas and Light Company Works. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 October 1999.  History  Panorama of the Gas Works, 1935 The West End Gasworks was established in June 1885 to supplement the Brisbane supply of gas. Commercial gas supply originated in London in 1812, Sydney in 1841, Melbourne in 1856 and Brisbane in 1865, at Petrie Bight. The Brisbane Gas Company's main market was north of the Brisbane River, but supply had extended across the river to South Brisbane by 30 June 1885 when The South Brisbane Gas and Light Company Limited was registered. From 1861 to 1864, Brisbane's population more than doubled, to 12,551. In the mid-1860s, Brisbane's infrastructure blossomed, with construction of the first cross-river bridge, a new Town Hall, a vastly improved water supply and its first gasworks. Commercial gas supply originated in London in 1812, Sydney in 1841 and Melbourne in 1856. The Brisbane Municipal Council was anxious to provide street lighting, for which gas was seen as the only feasible system. Earlier in the decade, the Colonial Government, supposedly for health reasons, refused permission for the Council to establish a gasworks on a site at Petrie's Bight. On the same site, however, in 1864, the Government authorised private enterprise to establish this new public utility. Central to these decisions was the Minister for Lands and Works, Arthur Macalister, then at the epicentre of friction between the Government and the Brisbane Council, friction which has erupted on several occasions ever since. The main demand for gas during the 1870s was probably for lighting, and the Municipal Council was almost certainly the Brisbane Gas Company's biggest customer. After the financial woes of the later 1860s there followed two decades of steady growth in Brisbane, reflected in an increase of demand for gas, for both lighting and for domestic and industrial fuel. Supply was expanded to, among other places, South Brisbane. Just as the Brisbane Gas Company entered the market on a boom in the 1860s, so did its southside competitor on the 1880s boom. At this stage, heedless of floods that had been recorded in the past, the vigorous south side 1880s development included the Orleigh Estate, the West End Estate, the Montague Estate, the Whynot Estate and the Dornoch Terrace Estate. The South Brisbane Gas and Light Company works was close to the centre of development of residences that would need gas, gas stoves and coke for their bed and sitting room fireplaces. The new Gas Company would supply all these necessities. A remote parcel of land was acquired later that year at Hockings paddock adjacent to the Brisbane River, to be supplemented by a further acquisition in 1891. The original gasworks was designed by John Davies, the Company's first Engineer and Manager, appointed on 16 June 1885. Construction was complete and mains were laid by 22 December 1886, when the first gas was supplied. Reticulation materials were bought for use in crossing the Brisbane River and supplying outlets in Queen Street, already supplied by the Brisbane Gas Company from its Petrie Bight works. A price-cutting war lasted until 1889 when the companies, without any concerns about restrictive trade practices, carved Brisbane up into north and south of the river as their respective marketing territories. It was not until the Gas Act of 1916 that the Government saw fit to look more closely at the cosy arrangements between gas companies, which by that stage included the Wynnum and Manly Gas and Lighting Company Limited, formed in 1912. The Act dealt with product quality and pressure, and provided for gas inspectors. Price was also dealt with. (A later piece of legislation, the Profiteering Prevention Act, also encompassed gas). An early map of the site shows two wharves in the river, one opposite the downstream end of the site and one a further short distance downstream of the site, apparently serving a neighbouring foundry. Early supplies of feedstock coal may have arrived by river. Later, coal was carted by lorries loaded from coal hoppers at the foot of the bank at the Albert Park side of Roma Street goods yards, c 1912. A weighbridge was constructed at the Beesley Street side of the site, presumably to measure incoming supplies of coal and outgoing sales of coke. Gasworks in the 1890 flood Mores serious flooding in 1893 The gasworks was flooded but not seriously damaged by a river flood in 1890. At that time the gasholders were of the frame-guided type, one controlled by counterbalances. The 1893 floods wrought severe damage, including destruction of the counterbalance gasholder. Importantly, much documentation, including engineering drawings on linen, was also lost. Following the flood, the City Engineer for South Brisbane, JS Louttit, recommended to his Council that, in view of the proneness to flooding of the gasworks, the Council should use electricity to light its streets. The flood not only severely damaged the works, but also reduced the size of the Company's market base. Many houses on the river flood plain, particularly on the Orleigh Estate, were destroyed, most of them less than 15 years old. By 1914, the Company's engineer was William Summers Moore (1869-1925). Moore, a second generation Gas Engineer arrived in Australia in 1889, and was associated with Gas works in Victoria, Armidale NSW (appt. Manager in 1894) and Townsville. From 1903 until at least 1907, Moore was prominent in the Queensland Institute of Engineers, of which he was elected auditor in November 1905. Earlier that year, he presented a paper \\"An elevated inclined tramway\\" noted as a cheap method of handling coal. In October 1907, Moore presented a further paper, \\"Gas or internal combustion engines\\" in which he forecast the replacement by internal combustion of steam as a power source. Following a visit by Moore to his home in England, to keep abreast of the latest developments in the gas industry, there was by 1914 a major revamp of the gasworks, of which there appear to be no technical details. However, there was a substantial increase in efficiency, the amount of gas per ton of coal increasing significantly during 1916-1918, and again in the years 1922-1924, with an overall improvement of 60%. William Moore died at his home, \\"Narara\\", Westbourne St., South Brisbane, 20 Jul 1925. Moore's successor as Engineer and Manager, WH Shedden, designed the next revamp, brought on stream in June 1930. (Shedden was still employed by the Company in the 1950s). Work included a new Glover-West vertical retort house, the contractor being West's Gas Improvement Co. Ltd. of George Street, Sydney. There was again an improvement in efficiency, of about 13%. As from 1930, the Company introduced high-pressure reticulation for all extensions in new areas. (With the introduction in the 1960s of natural gas, this 1930s innovation was assigned the name of Medium Pressure). This was effected by compressors, one of which, probably the first electric powered compressor used in the works, survives today as No.2 compressor. In 1935, there were three gasholders on site, No.1 a triple or quadruple lift of the spiral guide type, No.2 a single lift frame-guided type and No.3 a double lift frame-guided type, all of which have since been retired or replaced. However, site inspection suggests that the same (brick) water tanks have been adapted and/or re-used for the later gasholders. Capacity in 1935 seems to have been 922,000 cu.ft., one of the holders probably being the same or of the same configuration (non-telescopic) as the one that survived the 1893 flood. Gas Stripping Tower, now relocated to Davies Park By 1948, capacities in the central and eastern gasholders had been significantly increased, to provide a total capacity of 1,517,000 cu.ft., and gasholders 1 and 3 had been re-numbered to 3 and 1 respectively. The 1912 cast iron scrubber, known as the Gas Stripping Tower, obsolete by 1948, was taken out of service at around this time, later to be re-located in nearby parkland. The Company completed a further revamp during Shedden's management, in 1950, probably again to a Glover West design. At about this time, two new Holmes/Connersville compressors, No.1 and No.3, were installed in the compressor room on either side of a refurbished (No.2) Bryan Donkin compressor of about 1920s manufacture. All are still in the compressor room. No.3 is a variable speed unit, enabling accurate control of the pressurising function. Also at about this time, a standby gas-engine powered alternator/generator was installed, along with a main switchboard of significant proportions. These are housed in a compartment attached to what was described in 1994 as the Engine Drivers Room. In 1948, meters and valves occupied this space, the building probably being known as the Meter House. Both the meters and the compressors were housed in gabled brick buildings with arched sash windows. The east fronts of these two buildings are aligned and form an elegant pair when viewed from the east. With the advent in the late 1960s of natural gas, the South Brisbane Gas Company decided to move as soon as possible to the new feedstock. In December 1969, the old town gas plant was retired, and the retort house stood idle until it was demolished in 1974. In 1971, the Company name was changed to Allgas Energy Ltd. The 1974 flood wrought further havoc with Company documentation, the rescue of which understandably held low priority in the flood aftermath. Both Stanley Street office and Montague Road works were flooded. Demolition of most of the manufacturing and purification plant proceeded in 1974 and 1975. There remains no evidence on the site of any part of the carbonisation process, nor of tar or ammonia production or storage. In due course, the vacant part of the old site was disposed of and redeveloped as lot 1 on RP 141824. The remaining lot 2 was retained and part of the site was redeveloped as an outlet for natural gas for vehicles (NGV). However, all three of the gasholders were retained in service, along with the off-site 739,600 cu. ft. gasholder at Ekibin (Stephens Mountain). In 1992, all three at West End were of the spiral guide type and still in service. By 1994, the site was described as the West End Distribution Centre. No.1 and Ekibin gasholders were both serviceable, the other two being out of service. No.1 is a 4-lift gasholder, Ekibin was a 3-lift. At that stage, No.1 was linked to the compressors to provide emergency service if required, such as during load shedding or maintenance work on the high-pressure natural gas feed to the site. The contents of the gasholder could only be fed into the medium pressure system with compressor assistance or directly to the low-pressure system if the holder were at least two lifts full. That facility is no longer available, the compressors and No.1 gasholder being more or less intact but out of service by September 1999. The Ekibin gasholder was dismantled earlier in 1999 allegedly to facilitate upgrading of the SE freeway. The place was entered in the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000. In 2003 the Queensland Heritage Council approved demolition of what remained of the gasworks on condition that the place be photographically recorded prior to demolition; an interpretation plan be implemented; the gate, gateposts, fence and the governor be retained off-site; the gate, gateposts and fence be reinstated; and the governor be incorporated into the new development.  Description  All items of gas manufacture, such as retort houses, exhausters, condensers, scrubbers, washers, purifiers have been demolished. Most of these lay on the western side of the original site, which has now been redeveloped and is a separate parcel of land. The following items of historic engineering interest remained at the place in September 1999; however were later demolished or removed and retained for use in redevelopment of the allotment: * No.1 four- lift spiral-guided riveted construction gasholder, built probably in the 1940s, empty and open to the atmosphere, sitting in a brick tank of approximately diameter and approximately deep, probably constructed as part of the 1930 revamp. Capacity 908,000 cu ft. Height when full: approximately . The spherical crown of the bell is approximately high. * No.2 gasholder brick tank, approximately diameter, fenced off and containing contaminated water. * No.3 gasholder brick tank, approximately diameter, filled with earth. * A dismantled weighbridge stowed remote from its original well, which remains beside the Beesley Street fence. * A governor, by W Parkinson of London, housed in a small brick stuccoed building, adjacent to No.1 gasholder. Date of manufacture and original installation estimated to be 1880s. * The laboratory and its apparatus contents, housed in a brick stuccoed building located on the northern boundary of the site. * The compressor house, a single storey gabled brick building measuring approximately in plan, housing compressors in the compressor room as follows: ** No.1, Holmes (Huddersfield) Connersville Booster size SHS, capacity per hour at 520 rpm, date of manufacture 1949; driven by a Lancashire Dynamo and Crypto Ltd electric motor, 3 phase 440 volt, 103 amp 85 BHP at 1460 rpm, date of manufacture 1952. ** Nos. 2a and 2b, each per hour, Bryan Donkin Co Ltd, Chesterfield; driven by a Crompton Parkinson (Australia) Proprietary Limited electric motor, 3 phase continuous rating 400/440 volt, 36 amp 38 BHP at 1400 rpm, date of manufacture unknown. Reducing gears Radicon Redman by The Richardson Gears Pty Ltd, Victoria ** No.3, Holmes (Huddersfield) Connersville Booster size SHS, capacity per hour at 575 rpm, date of manufacture 1950; driven by a Vaskawa Electric (Japan) 3-phase variable speed induction motor through a variable speed coupling, date of manufacture 1974. * The southern half of the building features a sunken area in which pipes are run to and from the compressors. Steel grating is laid over the pipe space, which is currently partly flooded. * The Engine Drivers Room, formerly a meter room, in a single storey gabled brick building, of proportions similar to but slightly larger than those of the compressor house. * The Standby Alternator House, containing * Standby Brush alternator/generator, the DC element of 96 kW output, date of manufacture 1951, powered by a Type M4A5 gas engine of 137.5 maximum BHP at 1000 rpm. * The switchboard, probably dating from about 1930. (Energised as at 22.9.99). * The cylindrical riveted receiver vessel, mounted on two concrete piers and located against the north fence near No.3 gasholder. This vessel would receive and store compressed material required to service the medium pressure mains, from about 1930. The receiver has inlet and outlet pipes of diameter at either end. * An Art Deco-inspired rendered masonry fence with gate posts, metal balustrade inserts and gates runs the length of the allotment boundary with Montague Road.  Heritage listing  West End Gasworks Distribution Centre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 October 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The place and the equipment installed on and in the West End Gasworks Distribution Centre demonstrate the growth and development pattern of the reticulation of a vital public utility, the gas supply and its infrastructure, in South Brisbane and southern Brisbane suburbs from the 1880s boom through to the 1990s. They reflect the economic and social development of South Brisbane and the southern suburbs of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The remaining gasholder is the last of the spiral guide type remaining in Brisbane, and probably in Queensland. Three of five remaining low-pressure gasholders used to store and deliver town gas in Brisbane have been dismantled within the last year. Since 1992, two gasholders at the site have been removed. The West End gasholder is now one of only two remaining in Brisbane, possibly in Queensland, and is unfortunately but unquestionably rare. The station governor is unique of its type in Brisbane, and probably in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. One of the principal characteristics of early gasworks is the gasholder storage and compressor and other necessarily robust but sensitive and reliable machinery and apparatus required for filling and drawing from the storage. At the West End site, the remaining gasholder, the three brick gasholder tanks, the compressors, the compressor room/house, the receiver vessel and the governor clearly demonstrate these characteristics of the gasworks. The gasholder brick tanks illustrate major industrial use of brickwork from the 1880s up to the 1930s; and the compressors are exemplary of the change from steam powered to electric motor powered gas pumps. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Large round structures are unusual and have aesthetic value, particularly in areas of predominantly angular commercial and industrial construction such as West End. Aesthetically, the cylindrical gasholder with its spherical crown, even when empty, is both interesting and elegant. Also, the adjoining circular brick tanks contribute positively to the aesthetics of the site. The two largest remaining brick buildings on the site, one housing the compressors (themselves visually interesting), are attractive, aesthetically pleasing, early industrial structures. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. As long ago as 1930, Engineer and Manager JH Shedden recommended introduction of high-pressure gas distribution. His recommendation was accepted, paving the way for future expansion of the area of supply from the gasworks. The receiver vessel at the northern boundary of the site was constructed to receive compressed gas from the compressor room, and remains as evidence of this development.

He was born near Esfahan and educated in Esfahan and at the Qom Seminary. He became a mojtahed when he was 40. After the Islamic Revolution of 1979, he was selected as the Imam Jumu'ah (the chief mullah for Friday prayers) for the city of Kermanshah. He was killed by a member of the Mujahideen-e Khalq during Friday prayer on 15 October 1982. Early life Esfahani was born in 1902 in Khomeyni Shahr (then called Sadeh), a city located some west of the central city of Esfahan. His father, Mirza Asadollah, was a religious scholar; his mother, Lady Najmeh, was a daughter of Sayyed Mohammad Taghi MirDamadi. He is a descendant of one of the Jabal Amel () scholars who converted to Islam in the early days of Islam; his ancestors then moved to the area near Esfahan. (Language probably Farsi, by \\"FA\\" in URL) Education The young Esfahani made his preliminary studies in his birthplace, Sadeh (later called Khomeyni Shahr after the Islamic Revolution). At the age of 12, he went to the Esfahan Hawza (Seminary), where he stayed for about a decade, learning from such scholars as Ayatollah Besharati and Hassan Modarres. In 1923, at age 20, he moved to the Qom Seminary to continue his education. At first, he went to the Razawieh Seminary () for one year, then the Feyzieh Seminary () for about one more year before starting to study with Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi. After Haeri Yazdi's death in 1937, he studied under Mohammad Taghi Khansari, Seyed Mohammad Hojjat Kuh-Kamari, and Seyed Sadreddin Sadr. At age forty, he was certified for ijtihad () by Mohammad Taghi Khansari. When Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi went to Qom, Esfahani studied with him for 15 years. Relationship with Khomeini From the beginning of Esfahani's time in the Qom Seminary, Ayatollah Khomeini paid attention to him, citing his virtue and his scientific and practical efforts. Khomeini said about him: \\"This our dear altar martyr that was martyred in last Friday, was the great person who I have devotion towards him. I know this Blessed person almost sixty years.\\" Khomeini also said: \\"For long years I had known him, admired his calm, peaceful, and assuring spirit, as well as vast knowledge and good deeds.\\" The feelings were apparently mutual; Esfahani said that \\"No one can be compared with Imam Khomeini.\\" After death of Boroujerdi in 1961, Esfahani tried to declare Khomeini the Grand Marja', replacing Boroujerdi. Religious and political activities =Going to Kermanshah= In 1956, Esfahani moved to Kermanshah at Ayatollah Borujerdi's command, to spread the teachings of Islam and reopen the seminary in Kermanshah. In 1963, Khomeini appointed him as his representative in Kermanshah. After the Islamic Revolution on 6 October 1979, Khomeini selected him as Imam Jumu'ah of Kermanshah. =Role in the Islamic Revolution in Iran= He was one of the followers of Khomeini in the Iranian Revolution. Commemoration of the demise of Mostafa Khomeini by Esfahani was the base of the revolutionary movement in Kermanshah. On 5 January 1978, with the publication of an insulting article in the Ettela'at newspaper against Khomeini, there were demonstrations in many Iranian cities, including Kermanshah. Esfahani was the leader of the demonstration in Kermanshah, as well as many others in that city. =Iran‚ÄìIraq war= During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, he went to the war zones and spoke with Iranian soldiers. Also he stressed the importance of the war in sermons during Jumu'ah prayers. =Trying to unite Sunni and Shia= He tried to unite Sunni and Shia in Kermanshah. To attempt this, he visited Paveh, Javanrood, and Ravansar, the Sunni cities of Kermanshah, and held many meetings with Sunni scholars. =Books= * Al-Bayan * Interpretation of Qur'an (A brief review of Shia and Sunni interpretations) * Majma-Al-Shatat * The books about Muqatta'at * A book about Imam Mahdi.

Joseph H. Frost and his family was sent to the Clatsop Plains at the mouth of the Columbia River in 1841. Frustrated at his inability to convert the local Clatsop and Nehalem people, Frost took his family and left the area in August 1843. Josiah Parrish was appointed as his replacement, working at the station until its closure the following year in 1844. Establishment Until a residency was complete, Frost and his family resided at Fort George. Frost returned to the Willamette station to request additional members. A fellow missionary Rev. William W. Kone was assigned to accompany him as the planned Umpqua mission had been forfeited. Sailing down the Columbia on a boat loaned from McLoughlin, the Methodists eventually reached the Clatsop Plains. The mission building site was built within the traditional territory of the Clatsop Chinookans. According to Frost, these people \\"ignorant, superstitious and barbarous.\\" Events related to the small station were later recalled by Silas B. Smith, who moved to the Clatsop Plains as a child. After being hospitably received by neighboring Clatsops, Silas' father, Solomon Smith, helped efforts in establishing mission buildings. A band of Clatsops provided vital assistance by being \\"employed to haul and carry the timber for the houses...\\" in addition to providing food for the missionaries and settlers. A small house was made to house visiting natives who had until then slept on the floor of the main mission building. This was done as outright refusing any guests was feared to possibly lead to a violent confrontation. Closure Describing the heads of the Nehalems in the terms of Phrenology, Frost found them to have a \\"bump of avariciousness being very prominent\\". The Nehalems practice of head flattening according to the priest likely made this result. In correspondence to the Board in September 1841 Kone stated that Clatsop were \\"few in number, and not prepared to receive the Gospel.\\" Consequentially he and his family left for the United States in November 1841 due to the \\"unpromising prospects among the natives...\\" By February 1842, Frost concluded that \\"there never will be anything like a permanent Christian church raised up among [the Clatsops]\\" and decided the budget of the mission \\"ought to be expended to better purpose elsewhere.\\" Frost was unable to convert any Natives during his time there and left the area with his family on August 14, 1843. His replacement was Rev. Josiah Parrish, who operated the mission until its closure in the following year, where upon he purchased the property.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History.

He is generally counted as the forty-fourth in the list of 63 Nayanars. The Nayanar saint is described to serve the god Shiva by lighting lamps in his Thyagaraja Temple. He is said to have been willing to cut his throat to fill the lamps with his blood, when he ran out of oil. Life The life of Kaliya Nayanar is described in the Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Kaliya Nayanar was a Vaishya, the merchant caste. He was an oil-monger from Thiruvottriyur, presently in the city premises of Chennai, India. It is famous for its Thyagaraja Temple, dedicated to the god Shiva, the patron god of Shaivism. Kaliya is said to have lived on the Chakrapadi Street in Thiruvottriyur. Kaliya was very wealthy. He served Shiva by keeping the lamps in the temple lit day and night. To test Kaliya's devotion and reveal his absolute love for Shiva to the world, Shiva made his wealth diminish over time. However, Kaliya continued his service by supplying oil for lighting the lamps at the temple. His family refused to help him with the service. He also worked as a daily wage labourer to pay for the oil, unmindful of his status. He worked in an oil churning wheel and borrowed oil from work to light the lamps of the temple. As the people working in the oil business grew, he lost his source of income as a labourer. He even sold his properties. When all his oil was over, he decided to kill himself to fulfil his commitment to Shiva. He arranged the wicks in the lamps and took a knife to slit his throat; his blood could be used to substitute the oil in the lamps. However, Shiva caught hold of his hand as he started cutting his throat. Shiva appeared with his consort Parvati and blessed Kaliya, whose wound magically healed. Kaliya was granted moksha (salvation) and a place in Shiva's abode Kailash. Remembrance The idols of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. A holy day in the Tamil month of Adi, when the moon enters the Jyeshtha nakshatra (lunar mansion) is assigned for worship of Kaliya Nayanar.

He is generally counted as the 45th in the list of 63 Nayanars. Satti Nayanar is described to cut off the tongue of whoever talked ill of his patron god Shiva or Shiva's devotees. Life The life of Satti Nayanar is described in the Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Satti Nayanar was a Vellalar, a caste of agricultural land owners. Satti Nayanar belonged to Varinjiyur, presently in Tiruvarur District in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Little is known about this Nayanar. He was a devotee of the god Shiva, the patron god of Shaivism and honoured Shaivas, the devotees of Shiva. He did not tolerate any one who spoke ill about Shaivas and cut off the person's tongue. He is said to forcibly pull out the tongues of the \\"blasphemous sinners\\" with tongs and cut them off with sharp knife called satti, which gave him his name - Satti Nayanar. Shiva is said to blessed him for his service. Some Kannada and Sanskrit inscriptions state that Satti Nayanar (sometimes called Shaktinatha) had taken a vow to slay all non- Shaivas, not only those who slandered Shaivas. However, no tradition actually records him killing any individual. Though the blasphemers are not explicitly identified in the narrative, they are interpreted to be Jains or Buddhists. Satti Nayanar may sometimes be depicted severing the tongue of a Jain monk. In folk tradition, he is called Kalacittia. Assessment According to Swami Sivananda, the narrative of Satti Nayanar besides exalting the Nayanar saint, also touches upon the topic of blasphemy. The tale teaches that one should not speak ill of, revile or disparage holy men and devotees of God. The narrative emphasizes that not only talking ill of devotees is a sin, but also hearing to such profanity is harmful. Sivananda does not advocate the violent means of the Nayanar, but suggests that one should exit the place immediately, avoiding listening to the blasphemy. Dr. D. Dennis Hudson, Emeritus Professor of World Religions at Smith College identified twenty-four Nayanars, including Satti Nayanar, displaying \\"violent and fanatical devotion\\" and contrasts it with the \\"saintly devotion\\" in the Bhagavad Gita. These acts denote the \\"unusual and paradigmatic\\" love of the Nayanars for Shiva. The absolute nature of these acts, that go beyond the boundaries of convention and custom, makes them praiseworthy. Satti Nayanar's violence is justified by the maxim: \\"the sins of the devotees of the Lord are virtues whereas even the good actions performed by those without love are vices.\\" The Nayanar is also excused since the narrative blames the victim to be the instigator of the attack, by his actions. Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Satti Nayanar may be depicted cutting a person's tongue with a sickle or knife. A stone panel in the Airavatesvara Temple, the 12th- century Shiva temple in Darasuram built by the Chola king Rajaraja Chola II depicts him doing so with a sickle. A shrine in his honour is built in his home town of Varinjiyur. Satti Nayanar is specially worshipped in the Tamil month of Aippasi, when the moon crossed into the Pushya nakshatra (lunar mansion). He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu.

(), abbreviated Pegida (), is a pan-European, anti-Islam, far-right political movement. * * \\"PEGIDA in Germany\\". * \\"The Pegida Movement and German Political Culture: Is Right-Wing Populism Here to Stay?\\".   * * German Pegida believe that Germany is being increasingly Islamicized and defines itself in opposition to Islamic extremism. Pegida wants to curb immigration; it accuses authorities of failure to enforce immigration laws. Pegida has held many demonstrations; often there have been many public demonstrations against them as well. In 2015, , the founder of Pegida, resigned from the movement after reportedly posing as and making racist statements on Facebook. He was later reinstated. Though nationalism is a central feature, Pegida offshoots have formed in various countries. History =Origin= Alternate logo used by Pegida. Slogans such as \\"Violence-free and united against religious and proxy wars on German soil\\" are commonplace at Pegida rallies. Pegida was founded in October 2014 by , who runs a public relations agency in Dresden. 's impetus for starting Pegida was witnessing a rally by alleged supporters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) against the siege of Kobani by the Islamic State (ISIL) on 10 October 2014 in Dresden, which he posted on YouTube on the same day. The next day he founded a Facebook group called ('Patriotic Europeans against Islamisation of the Occident'). A few days earlier, on 7 October, a group of Muslims, assumed to be Salafists, had violently attacked alleged PKK supporters who were gathering after a demonstration against ISIL. The same day, Yazidis and Muslim Chechens had violently clashed in . On 26 October, out of 5,000 protesters, \\"at least 400 right-wing extremists went on a rampage in downtown Cologne during a demonstration\\" by \\"Hooligans Against Salafists\\". mentioned these events in a release for his first demonstration. =First wave of demonstrations= The first demonstration, or \\"evening stroll\\" (according to Pegida), took place on 20 October 2014, and attracted only a handful of people. During the following days, the movement began gaining wider public attention, and, subsequently, the weekly Monday demonstrations drew larger numbers of people. Among the 7,500 participants on 1 December 2014, the police identified 80 to 120 hooligans. The demonstration grew to 10,000 people on 8 December 2014. During the weekly demonstrations on Monday evenings, Pegida supporters carried banners with slogans such as \\"For the preservation of our culture\\", \\"Against religious fanaticism, against any kind of radicalism, together without violence\\", and \\"Against religious wars on German soil\\". On 19 December 2014, PEGIDA e.V. was legally registered in Dresden under the registration ID VR 7750, with as chairman, as vice-chairman, and as treasurer. Pegida also formally applied for the status of a nonprofit organization. =Aftermath of Charlie Hebdo and rising tensions= Charlie Hebdo shooting While the demonstration on 29 December 2014 was cancelled by the organizers, the movement continued to draw large numbers of participants in early January 2015. After the Charlie Hebdo shooting on 7 January 2015 in Paris, politicians (including ministers and ) warned Pegida against misusing the attack on Charlie Hebdo for its own political ends. On Saturday 10 January 2015 some 35,000 anti-Pegida protesters gathered to mourn the victims of Paris, observing a minute's silence in front of the . On 12 January 2015, Pegida organizers organized a rally of some 25,000 participants. Pegida's main organizer, , declared the six central political objectives of Pegida, which include calls for selective immigration and the expulsion of religious extremists, the right and duty to integrate, and tighter internal security. On 15 January 2015, a young Eritrean immigrant, Khaled Idris Bahray, was found stabbed to death in his Dresden high-rise apartment. International media correspondents portrayed an \\"atmosphere of hatred and resentment\\" and published social media comments of Pegida sympathizers, who had expressed disdain for the dead Eritrean. Pegida's organizers rejected any possible connection. One week later, the police investigation led to the arrest and eventual conviction of one of the victim's Eritrean housemates. Pegida demonstration on 25 January 2015 Dresden police did not permit the demonstration planned for 19 January 2015, due to a definite threat against one of Pegida's leadership members in form of an Arabic-language tweet labelling Pegida an \\"enemy of Islam\\". Pegida cancelled its 13th demonstration and stated in a post on its Facebook page that there was an explicit threat against a leadership member, and \\"his execution had been ordered by ISIS terrorists\\". Nonetheless, the Pegida demonstrations resumed in full force in the summer and autumn of 2015, with 10,000 demonstrators attending a rally in September. =Resignations= On 21 January 2015, resigned from his position with Pegida after coming under fire for a number of Facebook posts. Excerpts from a closed Facebook conversation incriminated as having designated immigrants as \\"animals\\", \\"scumbags\\" and \\"trash\\", classified as hate speech in Germany. He was also quoted commenting that extra security was needed at the welfare office \\"to protect employees from the animals\\". A self-portrait of allegedly posing as a reincarnation of , titled \\"He's back!\\" (which the later discovered to be a forgery, reporting that a moustache was added after the photo was taken), went viral in social media and was printed on title pages worldwide. On another occasion, had posted a photo of a man wearing the uniform of the US white supremacist organisation Ku Klux Klan accompanied by the slogan: \\"Three Ks a day keeps the minorities away\\". The Dresden state prosecutors opened an investigation for suspected (incitement), and Deputy Chancellor said the real face of Pegida had been exposed: \\"Anyone who puts on a Hitler disguise is either an idiot or a Nazi. People should think carefully about running after a Pied Piper like this\\". reported that Pegida's media spokeswoman, , turned to the Alternative for Germany () for advice, and that the and both confirmed there was a phone conversation between the AfD's and . said to that should no longer be supported (\\"\\"). On that same day announced 's resignation. On 28 January, resigned as well, citing \\"the massive hostility, threats and career disadvantages\\" as the reason. At the same time four other leading figures of Pegida stepped back. On 2 February 2015 and six other former Pegida members founded ('Direct Democracy for Europe') to distance themselves from the far-right tendencies of Pegida\\". =Reinstatement= In February 2015, Pegida confirmed on its Facebook page that had been re-elected as chairman by the six other members of the organisation's leadership committee, after the published a report that the Hitler moustache on the now infamous photo had been added after the photo was taken. =Dresden mayoral election, 2015= In June 2015, following the resignation of CDU incumbent on health grounds, , who was dismissed from Pegida's leadership circle in June 2016, ran for the mayoral office of Dresden, polling 9.6% in the first round with support from the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD). On 7 July 2015, group leader announced that Pegida would participate in all future federal elections in Germany. =Renewed protests= incitement to hatred The European migrant crisis revived the movement, which drew as many as 20,000 supporters to a 19 October 2015 rally in Dresden. At the same time, observers perceived a further radicalisation of the crowd. On 28 September, two journalists were injured when Pegida participants kicked a local newspaper reporter and punched another TV reporter in the face. On 12 October, Pegida demonstrators carried a mock gallows showing nooses reserved for Chancellor and her deputy . derided the demonstrators who made this, calling it a \\"laughable piece of work with spelling errors\\" (\\"\\"), a reference to the fact that the name Sigmar had been written with an \\"ie\\" (). At Pegida's anniversary event on 19 October 2015, keynote speaker named the Muslim refugees as invaders, with Germany becoming a \\"Muslim garbage dump\\". said that politicians were acting like \\" against their own people\\", as they wanted critics of Germany's refugee policy to leave the country. Addressing the crowd shouting \\"Resistance!\\", he claimed that the majority of Germans were held in contempt by the political class and that politicians wished that there were \\"other alternatives [to fight Pegida supporters] ‚Äì but the concentration camps are unfortunately out of order at the moment\\". The crowd applauded and laughed, and let him continue his speech for another 20 minutes before calling upon him to finish. When 1,500 to 2,000 people celebrated Pegida in 's first anniversary, dozens of hooligans protested, vandalizing foreign-owned shops. Over 100 people were arrested. Mayor Burkhard Jung called it \\"open street terror\\". = Party founding = The founder of Pegida, , has set up a new political party, the (\\"Liberal Direct Democratic People's Party\\", or ). The FDDV was established on 13 June 2016. Tommy Robinson founded a branch of Pegida in the United Kingdom. Position paper \\"\\" (\\"Putin, help us, save us!\\") and other slogans on signs and banners At the beginning of December 2014, Pegida published an undated and anonymous one-page manifesto of 19 bulleted position statements. Pegida's specific demands were initially unclear, largely because Pegida has refused a dialogue, considering the press to be a politically correct conspiracy. Demonstrators have been observed chanting (lying press) a term that has a long history in German politics. Variant of the \\" flag\\" proposed in 1944 by anti-Nazi resistance member that is often used by members of the movement. Alongside the German national flag, supporters of the movement have often been seen with a variant of the \\"Wirmer flag\\", a flag proposed by resistance member in 1944 for use after World War II. According to a report from December 2014, Pegida considers Islamism a misogynist and violent ideology. In January 2015 The Guardian described Pegida as a far-right movement, The New York Times labelled Pegida as anti-immigrant, and Angela Merkel has repeatedly questioned the motives underlying its anti- immigrant message. The State Authority for the Protection of the Constitution () of considers to be steered by right-wing nationalists. In February 2015 the 19 positions were enhanced and broken down to the ten \\"Theses of Dresden\\". 10 September 2015, Pegida demanded 10 changes in the refugee politics, where they called for an immediate stop for asylum seekers and for a German 'asylum- emergency law'. Participants and supporters According to Frank Richter, director of Saxony's Federal Agency for Civic Education, Pegida is \\"a mixed group‚Äîknown figures from the National Democratic Party of Germany, soccer hooligans, but also a sizable number of ordinary citizens\\". , director of the Migration Council has pointed out that the movement is strongest where people have hardly any experience with foreigners, and among \\"easterners who never really arrived in the Federal Republic and who now feel they have no voice\\". In December, , president of the of Saxony, said that initial suspicion that Pegida might tie in with the riots staged by earlier in Cologne were not substantiated, so the movement was not put under official surveillance. He said there were no indications that the organizers were embracing right- wingers. This assessment was contested by the weekly who researched the ideological proximity of Pegida organizer to the German Defence League or the European Identitarian movement. In a interview on 19 January Meyer-Plath reaffirmed that the participant spectrum was very diverse and that there was no evidence of radicalisation. Pegida demonstration in Dresden Dresden University of Technology (TU) interviewed 400 Pegida demonstrators on 22 December 2014 and 12 January 2015. According to the poll, the main reasons of their participation were dissatisfaction with the political situation (54 percent), \\"Islam, Islamism and Islamisation\\" (23 percent), criticism of the media and the public (20 percent), and reservations regarding asylum seekers and migrants (15 percent). In all, 42 percent had reservations regarding Muslims or Islam, 20 percent were concerned about a 'high rate of crimes' committed by asylum seekers, or feared socio-economic disadvantages. The author, , did not see Pegida as a movement of right-wing extremists, pensioners or the unemployed, but stated that the rallies served as a way to express feelings and resentments against a political and opinion-making elite which have not been publicly articulated before. A group of social scientists led by Dieter Rucht from the Social Science Research Centre Berlin () collected data both by flyer and online survey. Despite a participation rate of only 18 percent in the online survey, it largely had similar results to the survey in Dresden. According to data from the WZB, Pegida was a male-dominated group, participants were mostly employees with a relatively high level of education, they had no confidence in institutions and they sympathized with AfD. In some cases the participants demonstrated far-right and right-wing extremist attitudes. The conclusion emphasized that Pegida supporters cannot be viewed as 'ordinary citizens', since they articulate group-focused enmity and racism. on Facebook, the Pegida fan page had about 200,000 supporters. According to political consultant , the fanpage allows the users there to present and more easily spread their ideas, which are not represented in the mainstream media. In December 2014, representatives of the NPD encouraged people to participate in Pegida rallies, as did the German Defence League and the internet blog Politically Incorrect in an uploaded 'propaganda clip'. According to the police, a few hundred \\"violent hooligans\\" have been participating in the Dresden rallies since December 2014. The journalist supports Pegida with his new right youth magazine . Reactions =Counterdemonstrations= Demonstration against Pegida in Munich, 22 December 2014. Floodlights of Cologne Cathedral being switched off in protest against a Pegida march on 5 January 2015. Demonstration against Pegida in Cologne on 21 January 2015. The big banner reads \\"we stand in the way (of racism)\\", a popular anti racist slogan in Germany Numerous protests against Pegida and affiliated movements in cities across Germany have drawn up to 35,000 demonstrators in Dresden and up to 100,000 nationwide in January 2015, considerably more than Pegida's own concurrent demonstrations. In protest against a Pegida march, the floodlights of the Catholic Cologne Cathedral were switched off on the evening of 5 January 2015. Dresden's plant used the same method of protest. German tabloid newspaper launched a petition against Pegida, including former Chancellors and , as well as actress and former footballer . =Polls= According to a survey by the Emnid institute conducted in December 2014, 53% of East Germans and 48% of West Germans showed understanding for Pegida demonstrations. Differentiated by political parties, supporters consisted of 86% of all surveyed AfD members, 54% of all CDU members, 46% of all SPD members and 19% of all questioned supporters of and respectively. 43% of all Germans participating in the survey thought that Pegida protesters are mainly concerned about the \\"spread of Islam\\". 33% believed that mainly right wing extremists attend their demonstrations. On behalf of German online newspaper , YouGov conducted a survey from 12 to 15 December 2014. The survey showed that 30% of all 1107 surveyed felt sympathetic with regards to the demonstrations. Another 19% said they were understanding rather than the opposite. 26% approved at least partially of the demonstrations, while 10% showed little sympathy and a further 13% no understanding at all. A survey by TNS Infratest conducted in December 2014 on behalf of German magazine showed that 65% of all surveyed German citizens felt that the government did not respond appropriately to their concerns about asylum policy and immigration. 28% disagreed, while 34% observed an increasing Islamisation in Germany. A representative survey by Emnid conducted from 17 to 18 December 2014 showed that 85% of all 1006 surveyed were not willing to participate in demonstrations for Pegida policy. Only 9%, more than half of all surveyed AfD followers, said they were in fact willing to demonstrate. On 18 December 2014, the Forsa Institute conducted a survey which showed that 67% of all surveyed Germans considered the danger of Islamisation exaggerated. 29%, consisting of 71% of all surveyed AfD supporters, felt too strong an Islamic influence in Germany and deemed respective demonstrations justified. 13% said they would participate in protests near their residence. 10%, consisting of 57% of all surveyed AfD followers, would even vote for an anti- Islamic party. A special report by the Bertelsmann Foundation, complemented by a TNS Emnid survey from November 2014, showed that a majority of German citizens considered Islam dangerous. Consequently, there seemed to be a \\"strong sympathy\\" for \\"Pegida paroles\\". In absolute numbers, 57% of all surveyed thought of Islam as a danger. 40% felt like \\"foreigners in their own country‚Äú, while 24% stated that they would like to prevent further Muslim immigration. These opinions were not exclusive to any political camps or social classes. =Political opponents= Chancellor has criticized Pegida, saying that the leaders of Pegida \\"have prejudice, coldness, even hatred in their hearts\\". The Federal Minister of the Interior said that among the participants of the mass rallies were many ordinary people who expressed their concerns about the challenges of today's society. , the leader of the political party Alliance for Progress and Renewal, has said he considers most of the positions of Pegida to be legitimate. According to , the people taking part in these demonstrations did not feel that their concerns were being understood by politicians. Similarly, the Dresden city council's AfD faction welcomed Pegida's weekly demonstrations. , chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, voiced his opposition to the group, saying that the possibility of an Islamic conquest of Germany would be as \\"absurd\\" as a resurrection of the Nazi regime. described Pegida as being \\"highly dangerous\\": \\"It starts with verbal assault and leads to actual attacks like the one on a planned refugee hostel in Bavaria\\". He referred to an arson attack on a home for asylum-seekers that was ready for occupation. After the attack, swastika graffiti was found at the scene. Schuster said that Pegida is a combination of \\"neo-Nazis, far-right parties and citizens who think they are finally allowed to show their racism and xenophobia openly\\". He condemned the movement, stating that the fear of Islamist terror was being exploited to disparage an entire religion. from the Central Council of Muslims in Germany stated that again and again right-wing extremists gave the public the false impression of a racist Germany. The slogans of the protesters showed that xenophobia and anti-Semitic racism had become socially acceptable. Pegida has been criticized by Lutheran clergy, including the Bishop of Hamburg . 's credibility as a leader has been criticized because he has numerous criminal convictions, including \\"16 burglaries, drink-driving or without a licence and even dealing in cocaine\\". In 1998 he fled to South Africa to avoid German justice, but was finally extradited and served his two-year jail sentence. In November 2014, Saxony's Interior Minister, (CDU), claimed that foreign criminals stayed in Germany too long. He announced the creation of a special police unit to deal with criminal immigrants in Dresden and the rest of Saxony. Investigators and specialists in criminal and immigrant law would collaborate to process foreign criminals in the criminal justice system, and prevent those not eligible for asylum from obtaining the right to stay in Germany. admitted that there had been a number of criminal acts committed by immigrants near the homes for asylum-seekers, but these were a minority and should not be allowed to undermine solidarity with the great majority of law-abiding refugees. He said police worked on criminal immigrant cases too slowly. On the night of 5 January 2015, the lights illuminating the Brandenburg Gate were completely turned off in protest against the Berlin offshoot named and also the lights of the Catholic cathedral in Cologne in repudiation against . The exterior lighting of the in Dresden was also kept dark during the weekly Pegida marches. Both rallies in Berlin and Cologne were successfully blocked and disbanded by counterdemonstrations. On 26 January 2015 the US Overseas Security Advisory Council published an online security message entitled \\"Demonstration Notice Riots/Civil Unrest\\", stating U.S. citizens in Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich may \\"encounter Pegida and counter-Pegida demonstrations\\" on 26 January and 16 February 2015 in , and \\"should avoid areas of demonstrations\\". =Reactions from political scientists= Political scientist from Dresden believes that politicians are 'clueless' when it comes to dealing with Pegida. He says that this points to a serious problem in society, which neither the left wing nor parties of the political middle ground concern themselves with. This allows new social initiatives critical of Islam and immigrants to form. According to him, the demonstrators are normal people approachable by the CDU, if only the party stopped following ostrich policy concerning immigration. Far-right politics expert thinks that the demands in Pegida's position paper stem from the middle class centre-right and could as well be the content of CDU/CSU's position papers. Social psychologist from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence (IKG) assesses the party as a \\"middle-class right-wing populist movement\\". According to right-wing extremism researcher , Pegida states what many people think. says that these opinions are widespread in society and that great anti- democratic potential is erupting there. According to political scientist we are facing \\"a right-wing oriented group of enraged citizens\\", that \\"mingles with members of the right-wing scene and even hooligans\\". Political scientist Hajo Funke sees a connection between Pegida and the great increase in attacks on asylum seekers in 2014. He says that because politics did not react to the population's fear of ever-increasing numbers of asylum seekers, these groups could use these fears and fan them further. In his article for the German newspaper , political scientist and historian called it \\"cynical to want to place Pegida in the tradition of 1989\\". The demonstrators in Dresden do not align themselves with the philosophy of the extreme right-wing, he says, but they fit the bill for \\"extremism of the centre ground\\", which is widespread in Saxony and for whose \\"group-based misanthropy ... at times the CDU, but prevalently the NPD and as of now the AfD stand\\" in parliament. In a similar fashion, historian traces the fact that Pegida were able to form in Dresden back to the city's history. In one of his columns in the he referred to the Jewish emancipation of 19th century Saxony, where the comparatively few resident Jews were faced with unequally difficult legal obstacles. concluded that in Dresden \\"freedom, self-aggrandising local presumption and fear of foreigners\\" have long belonged together. Political philosopher considers Pegida an anti-political movement. According to , political action serves the common good and thus requires politicians to voice especially the interests of minorities. While politics was based on pluralism, Pegida was in fact anti- pluralistic and thus anti-political. In 's eyes, the movement has neither an appreciation of otherness nor empathy, which he sees as the basic virtue of political action. Explaining especially those protests against the actually non-existent threat of Islamisation from people with middle-class backgrounds, political scientist referred to results from studies on prejudice. These studies indicate that aggressive prejudices do not originate from those groups met with resentment, but are rather a result of the situation of those who have them. In addition, fear of social decline often seems to be expressed through aggression. This is then directed especially against those minorities which may seem dangerous, but are in reality unable to defend themselves, often due to a perceived unpopularity within the respective society. In the first half of the 20th century, it was the Jewish minority who were imputed with plans for world domination. Today, it is the Muslim minority who is accused of plotting an Islamisation of Europe. In an interview about Pegida, researcher on prejudice referred to his previous warnings about right-wing extremists using the fear of foreign infiltration for their ends. It was not the formation but the attendance figures that really surprised him. Political scientist and researcher on extremism considers Pegida demonstrations \\"a new phenomenon of xenophobia\\". In an interview, he accused Pegida leaders of fuelling \\"hostility and hatred against people of different ethnicity or religion\\". On 5 January 2015, the Council on Migration called for a new general orientation in German society. Since, in their eyes, migration was controllable only to a limited extent, they suggested an orientation committee. Consisting of politicians and representatives of immigrants and minorities, this would work together in order to analyse and redefine \\"German identity and solidarity in a pluralist republican society\\". Their results were to be included in German schools' curricula in order to emphasize the historical importance of migration in Germany. In the eyes of the Council, German policy has been influenced for far too long by the CDU's guiding principle of \\"Germany not being a land of immigration\\". Thus, a concept of integration should include foreigners and refugees in German society. According to the Council, German integration policy should not only focus on immigrants, but also provide courses on integration for groups such as Pegida. Praising German Chancellor 's distancing herself from Pegida, the Council stressed that an immigration society is a very complex construct. Political theorist considers Pegida a part of increasingly right-wing populist tendencies in Europe, in their Islamophobia possibly being the heir to widespread antisemitism. He claims that the demonstrations themselves expose the movement's moderate position paper as a fig leaf for \\"blatantly unconstitutional xenophobia\\". Thus, democrats should not sympathize with the movement, as their referring in particular to Judeo-Christian values was contrary to their actual demands. also voiced concerns about the \\"ghosts of the old nationalism re-entering Germany through the back door\\". According to political theorists, a democracy needs to be measured by how it protects its minorities. A knowledge of foreign cultures should be taught in schools. Only in this way would it be possible to understand globalisation as a chance for cultural enrichment in the face of global terrorism. =International reactions= The controversy around Pegida sparked reactions from international media as well. In France, wrote that Islamophobia divided German society, while and discussed possible parallels to the French far-right National Front. Several French and francophone cartoonists published a flyer aimed against a funeral march by Pegida in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015. The signatories ‚Äì among them a surviving member of Charlie Hebdos editorial staff ‚Äì disapproved of Pegida using the mourning to gather attention for their own cause. They stated that Pegida symbolized everything Charlie Hebdo had fought against and asked the population of Dresden for more tolerance and to be open towards different cultures. The Times claimed that, for the first time since 1945, a German populist movement was publicly complaining about an ethnic minority. This would frighten the establishment. BBC News said that Germany is not used to such large numbers of demonstrators supporting such positions. The Guardian described Pegida as an emerging campaign against immigrants that would eventually endanger tourism. The New York Times claimed that, because of its communist history, East Germany was more xenophobic than the rest of the country. The paper claimed that, in light of the low numbers of Muslims living in Saxony, the fear of Islamisation was bizarre. Russia Today reported comprehensively on Pegida. Its subsidiary Ruptly broadcast several rallies live on the internet. Turkey's and reported on Pegida and counterrallies. Sabah interpreted the demonstrations as a \\"rise of the radical right in Europe\\". In an interview with the , Turkish prime minister compared Pegida followers with members of the terror organisation IS. He said that both had an archaic mindset and that Turkey was \\"very concerned about Pegida\\". He called the movement a \\"threat to Turks, Muslims and Germany itself\\". The Arabic news network Al Jazeera primarily reported on counter-demonstrations. Offshoots and variations =In Germany= Pegida has spawned a number of smaller offshoots across Germany, including in Leipzig, in , in Kassel, in , in Bonn, in , and in Frankfurt. After some internal disputes, representatives of , an affiliate aiming to operate in the federal state of North Rhine Westphalia, distanced itself from the , and clones in North Rhine Westphalia. The latter were said to have been taken over by members of the openly xenophobic right-wing splinter party Pro NRW. In January 2015, replaced their media representative with , a member of the German Defence League, an anti-Islamist organisation modelled on the English Defence League. In December 2014, rival right-wing forces founded an anti-American Facebook group under the name PEGADA (, or \\"Patriotic Europeans Against the Americanisation of the West\\"), claiming the true problem was not the phenomenon of Islamism but the suspected American forces behind it. On 25 January they held a first rally in Erfurt under the title EnDgAmE (, or \\"Committed democrats against the Americanisation of Europe\\"). Promoted by a number of activists of the Third Position -Movement and by Hooligans against Salafists (). they attracted some 1,000 protesters, but were opposed by 800 mostly left-wing counter-demonstrators including Erfurt's mayor and trade union members, Jusos and the local . Another offshoot, , drew scrutiny after several of its members became involved in a neo-Nazi plot to bomb a refugee centre. =International= Pegida demonstration in Vienna on 2 February 2015 In January 2015, Pegida sympathizers held their first rally in Oslo, Norway with around 200 protesters, but this support quickly collapsed. In neighbouring Denmark, around 200 protesters marched in the capital, Copenhagen. In the same month, a Spanish branch applied for a protest outside the main mosque in Madrid, which was rejected by government officials. Marches were planned in Switzerland and Antwerp, Belgium but not permitted due to anti-terrorism raids in Verviers one week earlier. The Antwerp demonstration was finally held on 2 March 2015 without the mayor's permission. About 350 persons were present and about 227 of them were fined for participating in an unauthorized demonstration. On 28 February 2015, Pegida UK held its first protest in Newcastle upon Tyne, with around 400 attending. Around 1,000 people turned up to oppose, led by former MP George Galloway. There was a small Pegida demonstration in London on 4 April 2015, with a counter-demonstration by anti-fascist groups. The first Pegida demonstration in Sweden gathered eight people in and 5,000 opponents. When Pegida called a demonstration in they gathered four persons. In Uppsala, Pegida managed to gather about ten persons. Following several failed demonstrations and internal strife the Swedish branch dissolved. A demonstration on 28 March 2015 in Montreal, Canada by sympathizers of Pegida was cancelled when hundreds of people gathered to counter-protest. A demonstration on 19 September 2015 in Toronto was attended by about a dozen members of Pegida Canada. The demonstration ended in a melee with counter-protesters who outnumbered Pegida members about twenty to one. Political scientist Farid Hafez argues that Pegida was not able to settle down in Austria, since the far right FP√ñ already represented the ideology of Pegida in parliament and absorbed most of the far right human resources. Pegida Ireland had planned to have its inaugural rally in Dublin on 6 February 2016, during which Identity Ireland's Peter O‚ÄôLoughlin, who was also to be chairman of Pegida Ireland, was to speak.

Charter school laws and regulations In Pennsylvania, charter schools are initially approved and subsequently overseen by the local school board (Harrisburg School District). The Harrisburg City School District approved the original charter in 1998. It renewed the school's charter in July 2003 and again in July 2008. The school is governed by locally selected board members who serve up to 2 three year terms. The Board of Trustees of Sylvan Heights Science Charter School meet at least once a month. They make in depth, annual reports to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In Pennsylvania, charter schools are a public school alternative to the local, traditional public schools. Students apply for admission to a local charter school. The Commonwealth bases the funding for charter schools on the principle that the state's subsidies should follow the students, regardless of whether they choose to attend traditional public schools or charter schools. The Charter School Law also requires that charter schools bill each sending school district on a monthly basis for students attending the charter school. When the local school district provides transportation to its students it must also provide transportation at no cost to charter school students when the receiving school is within 10 miles of the district's borders. For Harrisburg School District residents, First Student Transit provides bus transportation for students who live more than one mile from the school. Pennsylvania charter schools have the same academic accountability as traditional public schools and must give the PSSAs to their pupils each year, working to achieve AYP status. They must also comply with state and federal public school laws and regulations. Parents of children must apply for admission in the Spring of the year. According to PA Charter School law, if more students apply to attend than there are open slots available, Charter Schools are required to use a random lottery system to select new incoming students. According to the Charter School law, siblings (brothers and sisters), and children of individuals who help establish a charter school, are granted an \\"admissions preference.\\" Students residing in the Harrisburg School District are selected first. If there are slots available for more students, seats are declared open for out-of-District students.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Charter School Annual Report 2013, 2013 Sylvan Heights Science Charter School was a wait list over several hundred students each year.Sylvan Heights Science Charter School Board of Trustees, Sylvan Heights Science Charter School annual reports, 2012 2015 School Performance Profile According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 28% of 4th graders were on grade level in reading, while 31% showed on grade level math skills.

The fourth grade is tested in reading, math and science. Pennsylvania System of School Assessments, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered beginning 2003 to all Pennsylvania public school students in grades 3rd-8th. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam is given to 4th grades and includes content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. ;4th Grade Reading: *2012 - 54% (17% below basic).

State - 84% Special education In December 2012, the school administration reported that 19 pupils or 8.7% of the school's pupils received special education services. In December 2010, the school's administration reported that 13 pupils or 5.9% of its pupils received special education services. In December 2009, the school's administration reported that 11 pupils or 5% of its pupils received special education services. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010‚Äì11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that public charter schools and public school districts which offered full-day kindergarten would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by public charter schools and public school districts in lower special education costs. Sylvan Heights Science Charter School has seen an increase in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, Sylvan Heights Science Charter School engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. The school has complied with the mandated web posting. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by public school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the LEA's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Sylvan Heights Science Charter School receives its special education funding through a higher tuition paid by the student's district of residency. The state sends the special education funds to the local school district, which is responsible for sending them to the charter schools its residents attend. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The school must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= The school's administration reported that none of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, each public school must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. School safety and bullying The school administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the school in 2012. There were no sexual incidents involving students reported. The local law enforcement was involved in one incidents at the schools. Each year the school safety data is reported by the school's administration to the Safe School Center, which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Board of Trustees has provided the school's antibully policy online in the student handbook.Sylvan Heights Science Charter School Board, Antibullying and Extortion Policy, 2014 All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the school must also conduct an annual review of that policy with its students and faculty. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. The school uses both the Second Step and P.R.I.D. E. programs to control the school's social climate. Grants In addition to tuition payments, Sylvan Heights Science Charter School can apply for government grants to increase its funding. Both the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Education offer several taxpayer funded education grants each year. Sylvan Heights Science Charter School did not participate in the Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, also referred to as the Keystones to Opportunity grant. The school also did not participate in PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell);Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 nor the annual Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education grants. =Federal Stimulus grant= Sylvan Heights Science Charter School received an extra $76,458 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one time expenditures like: acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. =Race to the Top grant= Sylvan Heights Science Charter School officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided nearly one half million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the board of trustees and the teachers to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of the majority of public school districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. State audits In 2012, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the school. The audit reported that a former member of the Sylvan Heights Science Charter School Board of Trustees had committed fraud. The board of trustees member in question took money for personal use. This money was to be deposited into the Family Advisory Committee fund in which she acted as President. The fund collects both cash and checks for student activity fundraisers throughout the year. Sylvan Heights Science Charter School had a two signatures are required for disbursements, however the same was not true for receipts. The board of trustees member in question paid $2,800. in restitution as of July 14, 2010. She resigned from the school's board as of August 19, 2009. The audit found that the special education professional lacked proper certification. History In 1997, Greater Harrisburg YWCA CEO Patricia Schwartz was approved for a state funded charter school planning grant to the Pennsylvania Department of Education for an elementary school that would focus on science, math, and related technology. Christie, Hansen & Associates was hired to assemble a group of volunteers and to prepare the application for a charter. The planning committee included: interested educators, community activists, businesspersons, parents, and YWCA staff. Individuals in the group included: Taja Barber, Cheryl Giles, Cheryl Harmon, Maryann Havalchak, Louise Kunkel, Brook Lenker, Fredrika McKain, Linda Moser, Bill Mosher, Jeanne Predmore, Stinson Stroup, Donna Weldon, and David Wise. The school's application was submitted to the Harrisburg School Board in September 1997. In January 1998, the Harrisburg School Board granted the Sylvan Heights Science Charter School a provisional charter. The school's first Board of Trustees had YWCA President Sheila Dow-Ford serving as President of the school. Five parents were appointed as members: Taja Barber, Julia Hoskins, Deidre Lenker, Fredrika McKain and Pamela Roberts; educators: Stinson Stroup, Cheryl Harmon, Louise Kunkel; business person: John Zarbus; and community activists: James Everett and David Wise. A group of parents known as the Founding Families organized the school lottery system and ran the school office for four months. Parents also functioned as part of the Curriculum Committee, chaired by Louise Kunkel; the Personnel Committee, chaired by Stinson Stroup; the Finance Committee, chaired by Pamela Roberts; and other groups necessary to get the school operating. Principal/CAO Susan Spadafore, M.Ed. was hired in June 1998.Kevin Moran, Sylvan Heights Science CS - Charter Annual Report 2008 - 2009, November 10, 2008 On August 31, 1998, Sylvan Heights Science Charter School opened its doors, becoming Harrisburg's first charter school. It had 88 students enrolled in kindergarten through second grade.

He created the copperplate etchings of sunspots for Galileo's Letters on Sunspots and the illustrations for Christoph Scheiner's Rosa Ursina. Greuter is best known for his plans and maps. He created architectural prints depicting Villa Mondragone, Villa Parisi and other notable buildings. He also produced a large number of maps, most notably those designed to be used for globes. His first globe map of the world was created in 1632 and was dedicated to Jacobo Boncompagno. It was based on an earlier globe by Willem Blaeu. The inclusion of Hokkaido indicates that he updated the design to take account of new discoveries, as the island was not known to Blaeu, but was documented by another map maker in Rome.

It was one of the early churches built in the new city in 1850. It was built as the \\"Chalmers Free Church of Scotland\\". History A prominent group of immigrants to South Australia (which was only settled by Europeans from 1836) supported the Free Church of Scotland movement. This group called Reverend John Gardner from Scotland, and established \\"Chalmers Free Church\\", named after Rev. Thomas Chalmers, the first moderator of the Free Church of Scotland in 1843. Gardner arrived in the colony in March 1850. He immediately initiated buying the land on the corner of North Terrace and Pulteney Street from (then Mr.) John Morphett, appointed English & Brown as architects and builders and laid the foundation stone on 3 September 1850. He held the first service in the new building on 6 July 1851. The cost of land and building was ¬£2,572 against the estimate of ¬£1,800 despite cost-saving measures which included substituting a shingle roof for slate tiles. The loan to the church, of ¬£1,000 at 12¬Ω p.c. interest, was guaranteed by trustees Capt. William Elder, George Young, George Elder, jun., Charles Matthew and Henry Chapman. The spire was added in 1858 at an additional cost of ¬£200 and a bell, brought out from England, was donated by (later Sir) Thomas Elder. The Presbytery of the Free Presbyterian Church of South Australia was formed 9 May 1854. The Free Presbyterian Church, United Presbyterian Church and the Church of Scotland merged in 1865 to form one Presbyterian Church of South Australia, although a section of the Free Presbyterians led by Rev James Benny of Morphett Vale did not join the union. When the states federated in 1901, the main Presbyterian denomination in each state federated, so Chalmers Church became part of the Presbyterian Church of Australia. Chalmers Church amalgamated with the Flinders Street Presbyterian Church congregation in 1929, with the new name \\"Scots Church\\". The Flinders Street property was eventually sold in 1956, yielding funds to build on the western side of the North Terrace property, using bluestone facings from Flinders Street. The current organ and western stained glass also came from Flinders Street. In 1977, the majority of the Presbyterian Church of Australia joined with the Methodist and most Congregational congregations to create the Uniting Church in Australia (UCA), the denomination of Scots Church today. Scots Church minister Rev Ian Tanner was elected as the first Moderator of the UCA Synod of South Australia, and then in 1985 became the fourth President of the Assembly of the Uniting Church in Australia The Scots Church building has been on the South Australian Heritage RegisterHeritage Places Database Search since 1986, and is the second-oldest church building in the City of Adelaide.

Algerian War of Independence (1954‚Äì1962)  Front page Free Algeria in 1950 for the celebration of the 13th anniversary of the Algerian People's Party. The Algerian War of Independence began in November 1954 and ended in 1962. The war was very brutal and long, and was the most recent major turning point in Algeria's history. Although often fratricidal, it ultimately united Algerians and seared the value of independence and the philosophy of anticolonialism into the national consciousness. Abusive tactics of the French Army remains a controversial subject in France to this day. In the early morning hours of 1 November 1954, the National Liberation Front (Front de Lib√©ration Nationale‚ÄîFLN) launched attacks throughout Algeria in the opening salvo of a war of independence. An important watershed in this war was the massacre of civilians by the FLN near the town of Philippeville in August 1955. The government claimed it killed 1,273 guerrillas in retaliation; according to the FLN, 12,000 Muslims perished in an orgy of bloodletting by the armed forces and police, as well as colon gangs. After Philippeville, all- out war began in Algeria. The FLN fought largely using guerrilla and terrorist tactics whilst the French counter-insurgency tactics often included severe reprisals and repression. Eventually, protracted negotiations led to a cease- fire signed by France and the FLN on March 18, 1962, at Evian, France. The Evian accords also provided for continuing economic, financial, technical, and cultural relations, along with interim administrative arrangements until a referendum on self-determination could be held. The Evian accords guaranteed the religious and property rights of French settlers, but the perception that they would not be respected led to the exodus of one million pieds-noirs and harkis. Between 350.000 and 1 million Algerians are estimated to have died during the war, and more than 2 million, out of a total Muslim population of 9 or 10 million, were made into refugees or forcibly relocated into government- controlled camps. Much of the countryside and agriculture was devastated, along with the modern economy, which had been dominated by urban European settlers (the pied-noirs). French sources estimated that at least 70,000 Muslim civilians were killed or abducted and presumed killed, by the FLN during the Algerian War. Nearly one million people of mostly French, Spanish and Italian descent were forced to flee Algeria at independence due to the unbridgeable rifts opened by the civil war and threats from units of the victorious FLN. Along with them fled most Algerians of Jewish descent and those Muslim Algerians who had supported a French Algeria (harkis). 30-150,000 pro-French Muslims were also killed in Algeria by FLN in post-war reprisals.Alistair Horne, A Savage War of Peace (1977) French President Charles De Gaulle pronounced Algeria an independent country on 3 July.

She received a Diploma in Sculpture in 1918. Whilst a student at Edinburgh College of Art, Bone resided at 15 Blacket Place, Edinburgh. During this time she also twice travelled to Paris, under a travel scholarship, to train specifically as an animal sculptor under Edouard Navellier. This travel scholarship, & tutoring by Navellier, was one which her fellow Edinburgh College Art alumni, the sculptor Mary Syme Boyd, would also undertake over ten years later between 1929-33. Bone served in the Women's Legion as a driver during the First World War. In Scotland, Bone quickly gained fame as an animal sculptor. At first she worked within the Holyrood Pottery but quickly became independent. She took up residence first at 5 Alva Street in Edinburgh where she lived until 1935. Bone was elected an associate member of the Royal Scottish Academy (1939) (nominated by Benno Schotz) and was the first woman to ever become a full member (1940). Originally she shared studios with the Scottish Colourists at the Albert Gallery, 24 Shandwick Place, Edinburgh. She latterly largely worked at the Dean studios in Dean Village (1935‚Äì50).

He was for two years assistant foreman for Fox, Henderson & Co., constructing The Crystal Palace. He emigrated to Australia on the Champion of the Seas, arriving in Melbourne in June 1856. He set up a blacksmith's workshop in Flinders Lane, where he fabricated straightforward iron components such as posts for houses and bridges, as well as undertaking a range of construction jobs. Around 1870 he hired an engineer, Thomas Pearce, who had trade experience with Boulton & Watt of Birmingham. With Pearce as an assistant, they greatly expanded their capabilities and specialised in fabricating hydraulic lifts, which were increasingly being installed in multi- storey buildings. The workshop grew and in 1888 he floated Johns Hydraulic & General Engineering Co. as a public company. In 1892 they formed a consortium as Johns & Waygood to supply and install passenger and goods lifts to the new Metropolitan Gas Company building. In 1893 the company became Johns & Waygood Limited after taking over the Australian arm of the British Richard Waygood & Co. Johns, Pearce and Charles Lawson were board members and major shareholders, as were Thomas Bent and George Swinburne. He died at home after a long illness, and was buried at Boroondara Cemetery, Kew. His son Alfred Johns, the noted cricketer, was on tour in England when news arrived that his father was dangerously ill and immediately left for home on the Oroya. He was by all accounts a generous and highly regarded employer. Members of the family have been actively involved throughout its history. Peter's younger son Fred W. Johns was a director and secretary, then chairman. His elder son F(rederick) Peter Johns joined the board in 1944. In 1966 Johns & Waygood absorbed the South Australian heavy engineering firm of Perry Engineering and in the following decade closed down their facilities at Mile End, Gawler and Whyalla.Susan Marsden, 'Perry, Sir Frank Tennyson (1887‚Äì1965)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 2000, accessed online 9 December 2014 Johns and Waygood Family Picnic - 10th of Feb 1923 - Portarlington Grand Hotel.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona has filed an amicus curiae for Jones, arguing that the law is \\"unconstitutionally vague and overbroad\\" Jones pleaded not guilty to the charge and was sentenced 30 days in prison and a $500 fine. Laverne Cox and Janet Mock joined a campaign against the Phoenix law, which they argue targets transgender women of color, following the conviction of Jones.

History Lloyd Price and James Balmain developed the idea for Zesty's healthcare appointment booking service after experiencing difficulties identifying and locating dental services. In August 2012, Price and Balmain began researching and developing a business plan. Zesty secured a seed funding round led by Mangrove Capital Partners, a venture capital firm based in Luxembourg, in January 2013. That May, Zesty launched its service in beta in London, England. The service locates available appointment slots by searching postcodes or specified boroughs. Zesty initially targeted private and National Health Service (NHS) dental markets. In July 2013, Zesty launched a web application compatible with smartphones and tablets. That month, the company partnered with Qinec, a practice management software provider, to improve accessibility to healthcare appointments. The company secured $2 million in additional seed funding in April 2014. The funding round was led by T A Ventures and ABRT Fund. The following month, Zesty expanded its service to include other types of healthcare professionals from private and public practices. In September 2014, The Huffington Post named Zesty one of ‚ÄúLondon's 7 Fast-Growing & Disruptive Health Tech Startups.‚Äù Operations Zesty is based in London, England.

His areas of teaching and research have been Farming Systems, Rural Development and Socioeconomics in the Tropics and Subtropics. He was Dean of Faculty at the University of Hohenheim.Werner Doppler on the Webpage of the University HohenheimWerner Doppler In: Ulrich Fellmeth, Kathrin Quast (Bearb.): Die akademischen Lehrer an der Universit√§t Hohenheim 1968‚Äì2005. Scripta-Mercaturae-Verlag, Stuttgart 2008, S. 95f. (online auf: uni-hohenheim.de)International Academic Search - Werner DopplerWerner Doppler on the Webpage of LovelybooksWerner Doppler on the Webpage Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  Life and professional career  As son of a farmer and wine producer, Werner Doppler managed the family farm on his own for some years. After this he studied agriculture and economics at the universities of Hohenheim and Kiel in Germany. He did his PhD in economics under the guidance of G√ºnther Weinschenck in 1974 in the field of Application of recursive linear mathematical models to analyze and predict regional development in the agricultural sector. He then joined the research team of Hans-Hartwig Ruthenberg as research scientist dealing with the development in the Tropics and Sub Tropics. In this period he spent research semesters at the University of Bradford/England and at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. This period ended with the ‚ÄúHabilitation‚Äù, the German assessment for the qualification of a university professorship. From 1979 to 1981 he joined the University of Nairobi/ Kenya as associate professor until he got the position of professor at the University of Hohenheim, Germany in the field of farm management in the tropics and sub tropics. Werner Doppler married Dorothea Frank in 1970. They have two sons, Fabian and Leander, and a daughter Adriane.  Lectures and academic training  The main focus in teaching was the application of quantitative socioeconomic methods and holistic approaches in farming and rural development in developing countries. Werner Doppler gave lectures in Master‚Äôs and PhD programs at the universities of Hohenheim, Karlsruhe and Heidelberg/Germany and at the University of Nairobi/Kenya, University of Florence/Italy, Universities of Amman/Jordan, Bradford/U.K., Thai Nguyen and Hanoi/Vietnam as well as in the Lutheran University in Palmas/Brazil. At the European Union level, Werner Doppler was involved in internationalizing the postgraduate university programs in accordance with the guidelines of the Bologna Process. During his time as Dean of Faculty at the University of Hohenheim he was responsible for the decisions, preparations and introduction of the international concept of BSc./MSc curricula and the European academic transfer system in 1997 as well as for the introduction of the first formalized international PhD program for students from developing countries in 1991. While he was director of the International PhD program in Hohenheim, funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), 104 students from 33 different overseas countries finished their PhD degree. Under his direct supervision 57 from 25 countries did their PhD research.  Research  * From a descriptive- analytical farming systems approach to quantitative, spatial future modeling In farming systems research, Werner Doppler combines the descriptive and comparative approach represented by Hans-Hartwig Ruthenberg, who explains the development process by analyzing the past, with quantitative methods in agriculture and economic research (e.g. Earl O. Heady, R.H. Day, and G. Weinschenck). As a result, quantitative, systems models for simulating future rural development are available which allow measuring the impact of future strategies in development projects and developing countries. In a further step, space in rural areas has become another dimension through information provided by integrating remote sensing in the methodological concept. With this, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can be applied and the economic models for future development extended to comprehensive spatial rural development models, which allow a high degree of internalization of problems, processes and decisions. * From farm management to living standards of families and decision-making in rural societies The application of classical farm management in developing countries is expanded by social, ecological and cultural influences in decision-making of families with similar consequences in the evaluation of development strategies. Werner Doppler considers living standard of families as central at the micro level and defines it with economic, food and health related, social and dependency-on-resource-owner and risk criteria. At the level of the society in a rural area, rural welfare is applied and defined as the sum of the living standard of all social groups in the region plus ecological, social and cultural aspects considered relevant from a societal point of view. Socioeconomic analyses and assessments of future strategies may show different results at the micro or societal level and indicate conflicts which can be seen in ecological misuse of resources. The relationship between family and society also shows a vertical link in decision-making and dependencies and may function as ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù or ‚Äútop-down‚Äù between families, communes, ethnic groups, projects, markets, regional administration and even the national level. This is especially relevant for availability, use and prices/costs of land, water, labor, capital, social network and social security as well as skills and knowledge. With all these extensions in at various levels of the methodology Werner Doppler aims at a holistic approach in analyzing the past and the present and forecasting the future, to better meet real life conditions of people and give more practical relevance to the quantification and assessment of impacts of future strategies. * The application of the concepts in developing countries The empirical research of Werner Doppler was exclusively related to developing countries. The research focus was on the impact of future problem-solving strategies on the living standard of families and rural welfare in the following fields: *Developing and sustainable use of water resources, organization and management of water distribution amongst user and water pricing policies (Middle East, Nepal/India, Southeast Asia) *Strategies to combat and prevent unsustainable use of land, desertification and erosion/land sliding in mountain zones (West and East Africa, Middle East, Southeast Asia) *Alternatives to deforestation and alternative energies (Southeast Asia, Brazil) and potentialities of regional development in remote mountain farming (Himalaya, Southeast Asia) *Environmentally sound, integrated livestock systems at a high standard of animal health in family farms with limited resources and deficits in food security (West Africa) *Rural income generation in family farms through storage, processing and marketing of agricultural products and the role of women (Africa) *Sustainable farming and land use systems at the forest margins of the tropical rainforest (Brazil) and the protection and support of indigenous people (Hill tribes Asia, ethnic groups Amazon area) *Limits and potentials of spatial infrastructure (transport, electricity, health care, schools, banks and money lending, public service) in developing rural areas (Southeast Asia, Brazil) In all research programs, the issues of food security, mobility and human migration, the regional administrative capacity as well as regulations in ownership/renting and hiring rights, regulations in market infrastructure and social services and the cultural framework have been elements in the concepts and their evaluation. The research programs have been carried out in cooperation with seven international research centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and with 26 universities in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  Publications  The research team of Werner Doppler published 25 books and 210 reviewed articles. The book on ‚ÄúTropical Farming Systems Economics‚Äù published in 2013 summarizes research programs and outcome. Werner Doppler is also founder and co-editor of the series ‚ÄùFarming and Rural Systems Economics‚Äù. There are 291 presentations at international conferences and workshops.

Rajni rejects a prospective candidate of her marriage and declares that she wants to marry a Christian boy Peter (Shekhar Suman) who works in her office, although not before the family of the groom, accepting Shiva for their daughter Basanti (Priyanka). Rajni has her way despite pleads from her family, and the parents also reluctantly agree after meeting the family of the boy who turns out to be from an educated and cultured family. Basanti agrees to help Vidyasagar with his studies, this however takes on a toll on her married life because of the time devoted on Vidya. This leads her to abruptly leave for her father's home without informing her husband's family, making matters worse. Shiva brings her back, but things don't really improve between them. Uma is pregnant and leaves for her mother's home and returns after a few months with the baby. In her absence, Rajni has argument with Peter and father-in-law (Shafi Inamdar) over trivial issues, one day she quits her job and angrily returns home. Vijay complains to her mother in giving his share of money to the family, claiming that now his family is going to expand and he might not be able to contribute further. His father casually dismisses it, claiming that Shiva contributes the same amount despite earning less than Vijay. The argument escalates to involve Rajni and Basanti as well. It ends with Deendayal asking Vijay to leave his house, upon which Vijay declares that he gave 18000 rupees for Rajni's wedding, he wants it back and would happily leave the house. A heartbroken Deendayal asks his wife to draw a line between the house, restricting his family to have any contact with Vijay. The rest of the family does not dare defy the decision of the father. To take matters further, Deendayal takes voluntary retirement, to collect his funds early, and starts working in double shifts at a shop and as a security guard to pay off the amount asked by Vijay. Uma returns to find the line dividing the house. She teams up with the house maid Gangubai (Aruna Irani) and mother in law to bring the family together. Cast * Anupam Kher...

Currently residing somewhere in the United States. He is accused of corruption, taking bribes from major companies and using his power to benefit his own companies. Early Life and Education Saikhanbileg was born on 20 January 1969, as the second of 4 children of Chimed Ochir, on the morning of the first day of Tsagaan Sar, the Lunar New Year, one of Mongolia's largest festive holidays, in Bayantumen soum (sub- province) of Dornod aimag, the easternmost province of Mongolia. His father, Chimed Ochir, and mother, Orolmaa Alag, were both engineers. His father oversaw the construction of new industrial, cultural, residential buildings, and the new airport built by the Russian Construction Company in Ulaanbaatar in the capital city of Mongolia and greatly contributed to the development of the city's modern image and look. His mother, Orolmaa, personally carried out the technological work of developing the film of all Mongolian feature films from the early 1960s to the mid-1990s. Saikhanbileg attended the 45th school in Ulaanbaatar city between 1976 and 1986, for general compulsory education. During his school years, he was a socially active student, serving as a board member of the children's organization of all schools in the capital. In 1983, he organized and supervised the largest Mongolian children's assembly, the 5th Annual Inheritor Conference. He also worked at the Mongolian National Television as a children's show host. After graduating from secondary school, Saikhanbileg went to Moscow to study history at the Moscow State University for Humanities from 1986 to 1991 and received a bachelor's degree in History and History Education. When working for the Mongolian Youth Federation, Mongolia's largest youth NGO, Saikhanbileg studied law and received his Bachelor of Law degree from the School of Law of the Mongolian National University in 1995. After his first election and service as a Member of Parliament, Saikhanbileg spent a year in Boulder, Colorado, at the University of Colorado Economics Institute from 2000 to 2001 and subsequently completed his master's degree at The George Washington University Law School in Washington DC, USA. Political career The Oyu Tolgoi mine has been a major political issue during Saikhanbileg's term As a young student in Moscow, Saikhanbileg witnessed Gorbachev's Perestroika and Glasnost; shortly afterwards, the fall of the Berlin Wall. As soon as he graduated from the University in 1991, he started to actively participate in the Mongolian Democratic Revolution. At that time, the ruling party ‚Äì the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party was influencing Mongolian youth through its largest youth organization, Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League. Saikhanbileg initiated and implemented numerous reforms and ideas in line with the ideals and mindsets of youths including the reorganization of this organization into the Mongolian Youth Federation, modernizing its form into that of the classical non- governmental organizations and expelling party influence. In a single year, he advanced within the organization from an ordinary MYF member to the organization's leader. To determine new principles of democracy and introduce change in the society, Mongolian Youth Federation formed the \\"Four Union Coalition in collaboration with the Democratic Union of Mongolia, the Student Union of Mongolia, and the New Progress Association and organized rallies and demonstrations. Mongolian Youth Federation and his team gained recognition and popularity not only in Mongolia, but also internationally, and in 1995 the World Youth Assembly named the MYF the \\"World's Best Youth Organization\\". In addition to working for the youth organization, he also hosted a very popular TV entertainment and talk shows among the youth such as \\"Agshin\\" and VIP. Saikhanbileg ran and won in the 1996 Mongolian parliamentary election, becoming the youngest Member of the Mongolian Parliament at the age of 27. A number of laws on reforms in the legislative and education sectors he initiated were passed by the Parliament. He was one of the initiating members of the 2000 Constitutional Amendment. Furthermore, he also initiated the Law on Parliament, the Law on the Legal Status of Parliament Members, and the Law on Parliamentary Procedures, which became the basis of today's core legal and regulatory system. In 1999 he was appointed Minister of Education, Science Technology and Culture by Parliament. His becoming a Cabinet Minister of Mongolia at the age of 29 marks the record of the youngest ministerial appointment in the new Mongolian history. During his tenure, Saikhanbileg reformed the higher (tertiary) education system, passed new tertiary education laws, and began accreditation system of all universities in Mongolia. The legal basis of private schools in the education system were legalized for the first time. In addition, universities came to be governed by an independent board and the appointment of university presidents were freed from political influence. Saikhanbileg also served as the first Chairman of the Board of the National University of Mongolia, the largest and oldest university in Mongolia. Mongolian youth began attending universities in Russia and Germany in the 1920s forming the first wave of Mongolian intellectuals. The second wave of educating the youth in Russia and Eastern Europe began in the late 1950s and early 1960s and continued through to the 1990s. As Minister of Education, from the late 1990s Saikhanbileg began the third wave of education, training Mongolian youth in USA, Australia, European Union, Japan and Korea which has continued to today, preparing the next generation of Mongolian professionals. This effort was complemented by Government's support to students ‚Äì stipends, tuition loans and aid. Additionally, he had the Law on Science and Technology approved, securing 1.5% of the annual government budget for science and technology. Saikhanbileg studied for 2 years in the United States of America after the 2000 Parliamentary Election. While studying at GWU, he conceived 2 ideas to implement in Mongolia and successfully achieved them after graduation. The first was estate planning, which was a concept unfamiliar to the Mongolian people. He established E&T; Law Firm and worked there from 2002 to 2004. The second idea was to establish a secondary school in line with American standards in Mongolia. Finding a partner and raising over US$10 million, he founded the American School of Ulaanbaatar (ASU) making it one of the most prestigious schools today. Each year, more than 600 students enroll in the K-12 program and each graduate is accepted into prestigious foreign schools. ASU has become one of the private benchmark schools, and many other schools have worked hard to reach its standards. This project was an important contribution to the American-Mongolian relationship as well as introducing American teaching and pedagogical standards and curricula in Mongolia. Saikhanbileg was appointed the Chairman of Information and Communication Technology Authority of the Mongolian Government after the 2004 Parliamentary Election where he served until 2008. Under his leadership, 2004 to 2008 was a period of rapid development in telecommunications and information technologies in Mongolia. He personally oversaw and completed the construction of high-speed Internet access and fiber-optic cables in 1.5 million km2 area of Mongolia, connecting 21 aimags and 330 soums during those years. This fiber-optic network became the first infrastructure in Mongolia to connect the entire country. Within only 4 years, a new network spanning almost 10,000 km had been built. He successfully managed the re-negotiation of a 20-year contract with the Korea Telecom company, which had been signed in 1995 and had granted the company an exclusive right to use central telecommunication network. Saikhanbileg was able to remove the exclusive rights, inviting fair competition to the industry. With the advent of two new cellular carriers, competition flourished, leading to reduction of users' bills by almost 3 to 4 times. Cellular phone user numbers increased to 4.3 million for 3 million Mongolians, making Mongolia a country with a leading mobile penetration rate. The percentage of smartphone users has grown to over 80%. At his initiative, the projects \\"E-Mongolia\\", \\"E-Government\\", \\"Internet for Every Family\\" and \\"A Computer for Every Child\\" were successfully implemented and the total size of Internet traffic was increased by a factor of 400. The IPTV project to connect Mongolia to the main fiber-optic network that connects Asia and Europe, was successfully implemented allowing the user to rewind any program aired within 72 hours. E-government project eliminated bureaucracy and red-tape in government services and enabled numerous innovative services to reach the public. His phenomenal transformations of Mongolia's IT industry won him the highest number of votes in 2008 Parliamentary Election in the Ulaanbaatar city constituency thus making him a second-term Member of Parliament. 2008 and 2009 were trying years for Mongolia due to the global financial crisis. The political situation was also tense after the mass riot on July 1, 2008. During this time, the two largest political parties put aside their differences, establishing a coalition and launched the largest economic project, the Oyu Tolgoi (OT). In those challenging circumstances Saikhanbileg led the Democratic Party floor in the Parliament, one of the two largest factions, and boldly solved pressing political and economic issues in 2008‚Äì2012. His leadership, management skills, problem-solving techniques and enabling attitude were constructive in overcoming the financial crisis, implementing the IMF program, subsequently attaining 14.5% economic growth and starting and advancing the complex Oyu Tolgoi project. In 2012 Parliamentary election, Saikhanbileg became a Member of Parliament for the third time, his Democratic Party faction gained the most number of seats in the Parliament and formed the Government. Saikhanbileg was appointed Chief of the Cabinet Secretariat, a Cabinet Minister. As Chief of the Cabinet Secretariat, Saikhanbileg undertook a series of important reforms to alleviate the burden of red-tape on business, invite for more openness along the core of World Bank Doing Business indicators, and within only 2 years, Mongolia advanced to the 56th from 97th in the world ranking. Moreover, by certain indicators, Mongolia excelled to rank among the top 20 countries. He established a permanent 11-11 Call Center for citizens to submit complaints and feedback, introduced government service electronic machines capable of providing 34 public services, implemented reforms in the professional inspectorate, and reformed government-issued permits for businesses and citizens, lowering the number from 900 to 300. Saikhanbileg was appointed the 28th Prime Minister of Mongolia on 21 November 2014. It was a time of crisis, with plunging commodity prices (commodities as gold, copper, and coal being the main revenue earners for Mongolia) and shrinking Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In his address to the Parliament on the day of his appointment as the country's Premier, Saikhanbileg noted: \\"My Government's priority will be the Economy, with the second priority being the Economy and the third ‚Äì Economy\\". He was able to realistically plan for a modest budget revenue and reduced the budget expenditures by MNT 2 trillion consecutively for 2 years. Collaborating with the Bank of Mongolia, he implemented \\"Good\\" programs with the intent to protect low-income segments of the population and support the middle class. Also, as a result of implementing the VAT registration system reform, cash transactions were drastically reduced and the number of cash and cashless transaction machines were increased by a factor of 4 in just the first year. Compared with economic performance of 2008‚Äì2009, when the country was under the same grave economic conditions and had shrunk by 1.3%, the economy under Saikhanbileg's management grew modestly by 1.3%, under the prevalently same tough economic circumstances. FDI has been one of the key drivers of Mongolia's economic growth. Saikhanbileg, as Prime Minister, worked relentlessly to attract foreign investment to Mongolia. He visited the main capital markets: London, New York, Dubai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Singapore, met with the leaders, businesses, and investors from those countries, organized Investment conferences in each country he visited, presented Mongolian markets and mega projects and invited them to invest. He also visited prominent television studios such as CNBC, CNN, Bloomberg, BBC, and CCTV for live programs to speak about the political environment surrounding the Mongolian economy and investment. He met with the World Bank, IMF, IFC, Credit Suisse, EBRD, ADB and ING, and their executives, and came up with specific solutions for investment and co-operation in Mongolia. As a result, the two-year negotiation of Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine was concluded and the decision to launch a $4.2 billion construction project was reached on 19 May 2015. More than half of the 6 to 7 percent Mongolian economic growth of today can be directly attributed to this project, launched by the financing of 14 international banks. Currently, 14,000 Mongolians and over 1,000 Mongolian companies are taking part in the project. Inaugurating the Oyu Tolgoi Project, Saikhanbileg said: \\"From now on, the OT project transforms from a controversial political matter into a business project. From now on, the matter will be settled by the members of the board and not by politicians.\\" But to this day, some authorities and parliament members continue to politicize the subject of OT and employ it as a topic for populism. During his service as a Prime Minister, Saikhanbileg attended and spoke at diverse international forums and fora such as WEF in Davos, Summer Davos forums and the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, speaking for Mongolia's challenges, solutions and successes. Prime Minister Saikhanbileg made timely decisions to seize the opportunity to purchase a 49% stake in Erdenet Copper Mine [which bears no less than OT at an economic value for Mongolia], held by Russia. These critical decisions transferred the title of a MNT 4.9 trillion worth asset to Mongolia. Just these two actions - securing the OT underground mine's US$4.2 billion investment and the Erdenet Copper Plant valued at MNT 4.9 trillion title transfer to Mongolia are the legacy of his Prime Ministership. In July 2016, as a Prime Minister of Mongolia, Saikhanbileg hosted the leaders of state and government of 53 countries of Europe and Asia for the ASEM Summit in the capital city of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar. He personally chaired the Organizing Committee of ASEM and took the charge for the successful and effective organization of important meetings within ASEM. Family and Personal Life Saikhanbileg is married and is a father of three. He met his wife, Baigal, at the Mongolian Student Festival on the shores of Baikal (Baigal) lake. Saikhanbileg and Baigal married in 1993. His spouse, Baigal graduated from the Mongolian National University of Arts and Culture with a degree in acting. She starred in 6 Mongolian feature films and dramas, immortalizing her youth on the screen. In her youth, she was named Mongolia's Top Model. After her husband entered the political arena, she ended her acting career and fully devoted herself to the family as a loving wife and a caring mother. As their children grew, Baigal started her own business. She founded one of the first beauty salons in Mongolia, Baigal Beauty (lit. Natural Beauty) in 2002. Furthermore, she expanded her Baigal House company to souvenirs and accessories featuring ancient Mongolian arts and traditions. She was selected as one of the 50 Top Business Women in Mongolia by Forbes Magazine in 2019. The eldest son, Unubileg Saikhanbileg graduated from Embry- Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida, USA and started as a pilot in Aero Mongolia aircompany. Currently, he is a pilot of a Boeing 767 at MIAT Mongolian Airlines, the national flag-carrier company. The eldest daughter Unuhishig Saikhanbileg is a senior at Babson College in Boston, USA. The youngest daughter Unu-Erdene Saikhanbileg is a primary school student. In recognition for his devoted service to his country, Saikhanbileg was awarded with state decorations ‚Äì Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of the Golden Polar Star. Saikhanbileg is fluent in Mongolian, Russian and English. He believes that every young Mongolian should learn the main international language-English and the languages of the two main neighboring countries, People's Republic of China and Russian Federation. To set an example for the youths of today, he is currently learning Mandarin Chinese. In his leisure, Saikhanbileg enjoys Powerlifting.

The expense of maintaining a unit of this description led to its amalgamation into a better-funded corps in 1876. History The 1st (Hanover Square) Middlesex Artillery Volunteer Corps was raised on 16 July 1860 during the great surge of enthusiasm after an invasion scare that saw the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett, Appendix VIII.Frederick, p. 665. Apart from the Adjutant, Major W.B. Stevens, who had served 21 years in the East India Company's Madras Army,Beckett, p. 126. they were all enthusiastic amateurs. A second battery was formed on 22 September 1860 Initially, the unit was based in Regent Street, but by November 1860 its headquarters (HQ) was at No 3 Hanover Square in London's Mayfair district. In 1864 it took over commercial premises at No 28 Leicester Square, formerly the residence of Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh and of his brother Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, and later of John Hunter the famous surgeon. Since then the square had become less socially exclusive.Nos 17‚Äì30 Leicester Square in Survey of London Volume 34 at British History Online. (The present No 28 dates from 1901.)Bradley & Pevsner, p. 418. From 21 April 1864 The 1st Middlesex AVC formed part of the 1st Administrative Battalion, Middlesex Artillery Volunteers, which was also headquartered at 28 Leicester Square, and which shared its commanding officer and adjutant. The other unit in the Admin Battalion was the 1st Tower Hamlets AVC, also founded in 1860 and based at Poplar in East London.Army List, January 1866. As civilians, the Volunteers sometimes let politics intrude into unit affairs. In 1866, members of the 1st Middlesex Artillery Volunteers were accused of fundraising for Governor Edward Eyre of Jamaica, whose brutal suppression of the Morant Bay Rebellion in the island had divided political opinion in London.Beckett, p. 146. At the great Easter Volunteer Review at Brighton Racecourse in 1862 (involving the sham 'Battle of White Hawk Down'),Brighton Racecourse at My Brighton and Hove. the 1st Middx AVC appeared with their field guns pulled by horses supplied for the occasion by Messrs Pickfords, the removal contractors. This initiative was welcomed by the Royal Commission on the Volunteer Force.Beckett, pp. 178‚Äì9. In 1868 the 1st Middlesex also travelled to Portsmouth with horsed guns, for the great volunteer review there at Easter.The 1st Middlesex Artillery Volunteers at Cosham. The Volunteer Review at Portsmouth, Illustrated London News, 18 April 1868 They were also present at the Brighton Volunteer Review in 1871 - taking their horse drawn guns there by road.The Brighton Volunteer Review. 1st Middlesex Artillery Volunteers sketches on the road, Illustrated London News, 15 April 1871, p372 But many Regular officers refused to believe that part- timers could be effective as field gunners, and despite the eloquent arguments of Lt-Col Shakespear of the 1st Middlesex Artillery Volunteers, the Secretary of State, Edward Cardwell, refused to allow the upkeep of guns, harness or horses to be paid from the Artillery Volunteers' government grant. The cost of maintaining artillery units was high, and as a result many AVCs were wound up during the 1870s. The 1st Tower Hamlets disbanded in 1873, and in October that year the City of London Artillery joined the 1st Admin Battalion, its CO taking over as CO of the whole battalion.

It is located near the county courthouse, in an area bounded by West Johnson Avenue, Semmes Avenue, and Pecan Street. It is a flat, square site, flanked by trees. At the beginning of the twentieth century a group of ladies formed a Cemetery Association to reclaim the burial ground which had become neglected. They fenced it, reset memorials and paths, and planted violets on the graves from which the ground got its current name. It is now managed by the City of Osceola.

Mohlke is a biologist at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. She is known for her work in human genetics, especially in the area of diabetes research.

She went on to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Human Genetics at University of Michigan in 1996. Work Following her graduation, Mohlke was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at University of Michigan from 1996-1998. She then became a Research Fellow at the National Institutes of Health until 2004, in the National Human Genome Research Institute. In 2004, Mohlke began working for University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in the School of Medicine, studying the genetics of complex traits and diseases. The Mohlke lab is currently identifying genetic variants and genes that influence common human traits with complex inheritance patterns, and is seeking to understand the biological function of the identified variants and genes. In 2012, Mohlke was a senior author of a study finding new variants of three genes (TBC1D30, KANK1 and PAM) related to diabetes. This study was significant as it was one of the first studies to use exome array genotyping, an alternative to genetic sequencing. Mohlke said: > \\"The exome array allowed us to test a large number of individuals in this > case, more than 8,000 people very efficiently. We expect that this type of > analysis will be useful for finding low-frequency variants associated with > many complex traits, including obesity or cancer.\\" Her research goals include identifying genetic loci responsible for genetic diseases; identifying important locations within these loci for testing; and understanding the functional mechanisms express these genes as physical characteristics.

Alongside the Part-time Work Directive and the Agency Work Directive its aim is to ensure that people who have not contracted for permanent jobs are nevertheless guaranteed a minimum level of equal treatment compared to full-time permanent staff. Fixed-term work contracts purport to be of limited duration, but staff with such contracts can claim that they are permanent after a maximum of four years. Member states in the European union can, and usually do, go beyond the minimum. Content Article 1 of the Directive states its purpose to enforce the framework agreement between the ETUC, the UNICE and the CEEP. This gives rise to the various provisions on fixed-term worker rights in the Directive. *clause 3(1) states that a fixed term worker is ‚Äòa person having an employment contract or relationship entered into directly between an employer and a worker where the end of the employment relationship is determined by objective conditions such as reaching a specific date, completing a specific task, or the occurrence of a specific event‚Äô. This definition was intended to exclude agency workers by referring to an employment contract entered into ‚Äòdirectly‚Äô: their rights are found in the Agency Work Directive. *clause 4(1) says that ‚Äòin respect of employment conditions, fixed-term workers shall not be treated in a less favourable manner than comparable permanent workers solely because they have a fixed term contract or relation unless different treatment is justified on objective grounds.‚Äô (2) pro-rata (3) social partners should be consulted before qualification periods set (4) ‚ÄòPeriod-of service qualifications relating to particular conditions of employment shall be the same for fixed-term workers as for permanent workers except where different length-of service qualifications are justified on objective grounds.‚Äô *clause 5 prevents abuse of fixed term contracts, by implementing either (a) objective reasons for renewal (b) a limit of total duration of successive fixed term contracts (c) a limit of number of renewals *clause 6 requires that fixed-term workers receive the same information and employment opportunities *clause 7 requires that fixed-term workers receive the same information and consultation rights *clause 8, says that member states can be more favourable in their national laws Implementation =EU case law= *Adeneler v Ellinikos Organismos Galaktos (2006) C-212/04, [2006] IRLR 716 *Mangold v Helm [2006] IRLR 143 (C-144/04) *Del Cerro Alonso v Osakidetza-Servicio Vasco de Salud (2007) C-307/05, [2007] IRLR 911 =United Kingdom= In UK labour law, the ERA 1996 sections 95(1)(b), 136(1)(b), 235(2B) already regulated fixed-term work for the purpose of unfair dismissal.

Hey, lihat nona jauh, Rasa sayang sayang, hey! Buah cempedak di luar pagar, Ambil galah tolong jolokkan; Saya budak baru belajar, Kalau salah tolong tunjukkan. Pulau pandan jauh ke tengah, Gunung daik bercabang tiga; Hancur badan di kandung tanah, Budi yang baik dikenang juga. Dua tiga kucing berlari, Mana sama si kucing belang; Dua tiga boleh ku cari, Mana sama adik seorang. Pisang emas dibawa berlayar, Masak sebiji di atas peti; Hutang emas boleh dibayar, Hutang budi dibawa mati.  I've got that loving feeling, hey! I've got that loving feeling, hey! See that girl in the distance, I've got that loving feeling hey! The cempedak fruit is outside the fence, Take a pole and poke it down; I'm just a child trying to learn, So if i'm wrong then please tell me. Pandan Island far in midst, With the three peaked Mount Daik; While the body decomposes in earth, Good deeds remain to be remembered. Two or three cats are running around, With the striped one which can vie; Two or three I can find, Which girl can compare with you. Pisang emas brought on a sailing trip, One ripens on a box; If gold is owed, it can be repaid, But if it is gratitude, it is carried to the grave.  I've got that loving feeling, hey! I've got that loving feeling, hey! See that girl in the distance, I've got that loving feeling hey! Where cempedak tree grows without the fence, Go prod them gently with a stake; A youthful learner I, so hence, Be please to point out each mistake. The Pandan Isle is far from land, Have three peaks does the Daik Mountain; Though the self has rot in the sand, The good deeds are never forgotten. Two or three cats are running around, The cat with stripes is the one superior; Two or three (gals) can be easily found, But not the same as having you, my dear. With golden plantains sail away, Whilst on a chest lies one that‚Äôs ripe; The debts of gold we can repay, But debts of kindness last through life. } Because this song is in pantun form, for each quatrain, there is no relevance of the first two lines to the message conveyed by the last two except to provide the rhyming scheme. There are a number of versions of the lyrics of \\"Rasa Sayang\\", but it usually starts with this refrain: :Rasa sayang, hey! :Rasa sayang-sayang hey, :Lihat nona dari jauh, :Rasa sayang- sayang, hey The refrain is then followed by a wide variety of popular Malay pantun Controversy Controversy over the song's provenance came to a head in 2007 when the Malaysian Tourism Board released the Rasa Sayang Commercial, an advertisement used as part of Malaysia's \\"Truly Asia\\" tourism campaign.\\"Folk song sparks row between Indonesia, Malaysia.\\" Tourism Indonesia. 3 October 2007. Some Indonesians have accused Malaysia of heritage theft. Malaysia in return claimed that the song belongs to people of Maritime Southeast Asia, Malaysians and Indonesians alike. Malaysian Tourism Minister Adnan Mansor stated, \\"It is a folk song from the Nusantara and we are part of the Nusantara.\\". Although Nusantara, Adnan Mansor also said that he himself did not know who this song had when he met and apologized to Surya Paloh in Indonesia. Adnan Mansor said that he spoke with one of the ambassadors who finally told him about the song Rasa Sayange which came from Indonesia. The Ambassador stated that Indonesia has a lot of cultural heritage. He also apologized in front of Surya Paloh and his entourage for the misunderstanding. According to Adnan Mansor, \\"There is no intention from Malaysia to claim Indonesia's cultural heritage. We consider Indonesia a kind of brother. We are allied, I am half Aceh.

Indonesian media reported to have in possession the oldest recording of the song. \\"Rasa Sayange\\" is known to be recorded first at the 1962 Lokananta Solo record company on November 11, 2007. The LPs were distributed as souvenirs to participants of the 4th Asian Games in 1962 in Jakarta, and the song \\"Rasa Sayange\\" was one of the Indonesian folk songs on the dish, along with other Indonesian ethnic songs such as Cheers for Joy, O Ina ni Keke, and Sengko Dainang. Earlier in 1959, a comedy film in Malay language titled Rasa Sayang Eh was produced by Cathay Keris in Singapore. The song also appeared in the Japanese film Marai no Tora in 1943, depicting the exploits of a Japanese secret agent Tani Yutaka in Malaya during the World War II. In 1954 and 1950, Indonesia launched films entitled Lewat Djam Malam and Darah dan Doa by director Usmar Ismail, which included the song \\"Rasa Sayange\\". But long before that, the Dutch East Indies now (Indonesia) had made promotional recordings using this song before World War II. This film, titled Insulinde zooals het leeft en werkt, was published between 1927 and 1940, and is described as a silent film (not talking). A copy of this digital film was distributed via YouTube by multimedia expert Roy Suryo, who claimed to have found this digital film, but admitted that he had not yet found the original film. The rhythm of the song Rasa Sayang that was heard in the film Insulinde, a film that portrays the Dutch East Indies from 1927-1940, can be watched in Rasa Sayang Sayange in the Dutch film. The original footage of this film is stored in the Gedung Arsip Nasional, Jakarta.. In addition, this film also once existed under the title Insulinde (1925) which was directed by Max Hauschild.

Their brother Skelton almost immediate joined them in the business which grew rapidly, purchasing stores along Fargate and round into Church Street. The business had grown so much that in 1869, a rebuild of the stores was commissioned with a new frontage and an extra two stories. The business continued to expand with further stores added, and rebuilt to match the architecture of the store, and by 1898 the business was incorporated. However Skelton Cole did not see this achievement, dying in 1896, while his brother John died in 1898. The business continued to be run by the Cole family, with two sons of the brothers Thomas and Thomas Skelton taking over the reins. By 1909, the business had started employing women, which was to be a benefit with the outbreak of World War One looming. The business had also grown to local prominence with locals regarding the area as Cole's Corner, something that lives on to today. Technology was at the forefront of the store, with delivery vans being added in 1911, while the first cash registers arrived in 1916. The store continued to grow with a further two stories being added to the store in 1920, however in the same year the business was sold to Gordon Selfridge. The business transferred into his Selfridge Provincial Stores Group in 1927. Acquisition With the advent of the Second World War, Selfridges Provincial Stores group was sold to John Lewis. Luck was on John Lewis's side as the Cole Brothers store was not damaged during the war. The business struggled like many during the early 1950s, but by 1960 the partners at Cole Brothers decided to open a new store. The new store located at Barker's Pool was opposite the City Hall and was part of the drive to rebuild Sheffield. The old store was sold in 1962 for ¬£1,000,000 and the business moved into its new premises on 17 September 1963. The new store proved popular, and in 1974 the offices were re-located out of the new building to make way for more store space. The store again expanded in 1977 when a shop was purchased on Cambridge Street to host the business's Toy & Sports departments. The store was refurbished in the early 1980s, however the store struggled well into the 1990s due to the economic changes that happened in Sheffield at this time. The store continued to operate as Cole brothers until 2002, when the store was re-branded as John Lewis.

Early career Havili is of PƒÅkeha and Tongan descent and is the son of former Nelson Bays rugby representative Bill Havili. David was born in the town of Nelson on New Zealand's South Island, but raised in nearby Motueka. He initially attended Motueka High School in his hometown, but later went to Nelson College, where he was a member of their 1st XV rugby team. After graduating high school he began working as a builder's apprentice while playing local club rugby for Nelson. During this time, he made his way through 's youth structures and was a member of the Knights Development team. Senior career =Tasman= Havili made the Tasman Mako squad for the first time in 2014, and burst onto the scene with 4 tries in 10 appearances for the men from Nelson as they reached the final of the ITM Cup Premiership before going down 36-32 to . He played all 11 games for the Mako in their run to the semi-finals in 2015, netting 31 points in the process. Tasman were again losing finalists in 2016 with Havili playing a key role with 2 tries in 10 games. During the 2019 season Havili captained Tasman to their first Mitre 10 Cup championship, scoring a try in the final win over Wellington. =Super Rugby= As a result of his impressive displays in his debut season at provincial level, Havili was named as a member of the Crusaders wider training group for the 2015 Super Rugby season. Somewhat surprisingly, he featured 11 times in his first season in Christchurch and helped himself to 2 tries which saw him promoted to the full squad for 2016. He made 14 appearances in 2016 and contributed 2 tries as the Crusaders reached the competition's quarter- finals before going down 42-25 to the in Johannesburg. In October 2016, it was announced that he had signed a new 3-year deal which would see him stay with the Crusaders through to the end of the 2019 season. Havili started at inside centre against the touring British and Irish Lions in 2017, slotting into the place of the injured Ryan Crotty. Havili's 80-minute performance did not see him score any points, as the Crusaders lost to the Lions 3-12. In the 2017 Super Rugby season, Havili was a key member of the Crusaders squad that lost only one match on the way to their eighth Super Rugby title. Havili was one of the Crusaders stand-out performers in the 2017 season, not only displacing All Blacks 60-plus-test veteran Israel Dagg from the fullback position, causing Dagg to be shifted to the right wing upon his return from a knee injury, but was also voted the Crusaders Player of the Year for 2017. Havili was one of the leading try-scorers of the 2017 Super Rugby season, finishing with 8 tries. Winger Seta Tamanivalu was the only Crusader to score more tries than Havili, scoring 10 tries in 2017. Havili again played a crucial part in the Crusaders title wins in 2018 and 2019. =International= Havili was a member of the New Zealand Under 20 side that finished 3rd in the 2014 IRB Junior World Championship in his home country. He was not named in the initial squad, but was later called up to replace the injured Simon Hickey. Havili was called up to the All Blacks for the 2017 Rugby Championship squad after shoulder surgery ruled out Hurricanes back Jordie Barrett for the rest of the year. Havili made his All Blacks debut against the Pumas on 1 October 2017 at Jos√© Amalfitani Stadium in Buenos Aires, replacing in-form winger Rieko Ioane with only 10 minutes left of the match. Despite only 10 minutes of game time Havili scored a try in the last minute of the test, allowing the All Blacks to beat Los Pumas 39-22. His standout performance against Argentina saw him named on the bench the following week against South Africa where he replaced the injured Nehe Milner-Skudder shortly before half time. Havili was the best- performing substitute off the bench in that fixture, setting up Damian McKenzie's try to make the score a 25-24 win over the Springboks for New Zealand. Havili played in three games on the 2017 end-of-year tour, the first of which was a quiet performance in a 23-18 loss to the Wallabies where he replaced Lima Sopoaga off the bench. Havili earned his first start for the All Blacks on 5 November 2017 in a 31-22 win over the Barbarians where he was replaced by Sopoaga in the 46th minute. Havili also started for the All Blacks ten days later in a 28-23 win over a French XV where he produced a good performance and was not subbed off.

Rennenberg led an army to lay siege at Steenwijk but was defeated when an Anglo-Dutch relief army under John Norreys arrived. Many of Rennenberg's army were sick and in a mutinous mood; they fled east towards Groningen and with Norreys in pursuit not too far behind. Rennenberg, hoping to catch his pursuers off guard, turned and faced them at Kollum. Norreys attacked almost at once sweeping away the Spanish forces from the field who then fled all the way to Groningen itself. The battle was one sided and a heavy defeat; Spanish casualties were heavy with 700 killed, wounded, or captured and in addition the loss of all their military baggage and all four of their field guns. Rennenberg, who had been too ill to take command, died four days later at Groningen. Rennenberg's successor Francisco Verdugo soon attacked again at Noordhorn; this time Norreys was defeated in the pitched battle.

It lies on the international border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and it was first climbed in 1935. A mountain nearby to the west was originally named Lingtrennup but is now more commonly called Xi Lingchain.  Geography  Topographical map of the region A long chain of mountains extends generally somewhat north of west from Mount Everest whose west ridge descends to the col of Lho La () before rising to Khumbutse (). The ridge drops to an unnamed col at and then ascends to Lingtren from where it continues to another unnamed col at and then to Pumori (). Bounded on the north by this chain of mountains is the Western Cwm in Nepal down which the Khumbu Glacier descends to the northwest over the Icefall before it turns sharply southwest. Lingtren lies at the apex of this right-angled bend. North of the mountain chain in Tibet the West Rongbuk Glacier flows east to join the main Rongbuk Glacier. Near Lingtren, the Khumbu glacier is at about whereas the West Rongbuk glacier is at about . Geologically the south face of the mountain is of black gneiss overlain by a thick sill of massive granite. The gneiss has been intruded with many thinner granite sills. The summit elevation is alternatively stated to be and using different elevation models. Lingtren's prominence is about above its key col, which is between it and its nearest higher neighbour Pumori.  Discovery  1921 expedition map Lingtren can easily be seen from inhabited villages in the Khumbu valley of Nepal but it may be that the first time it was seen by western explorers was from Tibet in 1921. During the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition George Mallory and Guy Bullock were exploring the region to the north of Mount Everest hoping to find a route to the summit. Everest's west ridge did not seem promising so they tried to reach the watershed at some point to see what lay to the south. In doing this they discovered Lingtren (but did not climb it) and skirted its flanks to reach a col from where they were able to see the Western Cwm for the first time. However, the prospect of a precipitous descent to the Khumbu Glacier and then an ascent of the Khumbu Icefall led them to reject this route.  Naming  The peak now known as Lingtren is actually part of a complex formation extending to the north into the West Rongbuk Glacier (see 1921 expedition map). The northern section, at the junction of the west and main Rongbuk glaciers, is now generally called Guangming Peak () and has an elevation of . The name \\"Lingtren\\" now only refers to the highest summit, which is immediately to the north of the Khumbu Glacier. Mallory and Bullock suggested names for the many topographical features they discovered and these were endorsed by the expedition and passed to Charles Bell, Britain's special ambassador to Lhasa, for approval. With reference to the whole Lingtren complex, they chose the name Lingtren as Tibetan for \\"subcontinent\\" or \\"island\\". By allusion, this word is also used to describe a lesser temple associated with a main temple. There is another peak jutting into the West Rongbuk glacier but further to the west which proved to be an excellent location for observing and photographing the mountainous topography. This they named \\"Lingtrennup\\" (West Lingtren) and Mallory frequently referred to it by the nickname \\"Island Peak\\" because of its isolated location. This mountain has an elevation of and it is now generally called Xi Lingchain ().  First Ascent  The 1935 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition again explored the region and on this occasion, during what Eric Shipton called \\"a veritable orgy of mountain climbing\\", Shipton and Leslie Vickery \\"Dan\\" Bryant climbed for the first time an outlying peak of Lingtren, Lingtrennup and then the main peak of Lingtren. As they were finally descending along a narrow ridge of ice they broke through a cornice and Bryant fell over . Shipton was able to hold the rope and Bryant, who had retained his ice axe, was able to climb back.  Subsequent events  Pumori, Lingtren and Khumbutse panorama When ascending the Khumbu valley at the start of the successful 1953 Everest expedition, John Hunt said that the glacier appeared as if it could only originate at an apparent valley head between Lingtren and Nuptse ‚Äì the Icefall and Western Cwm were completely invisible around the sharp bend in the glacier. He described one summit of Lingtren as being \\"square and steep- ridged\\" and another to the east (he called it Lingtren Two) as \\"thin as a wafer at its top, looking incredibly fragile\\". There has been no fully accepted record of the mountain having been climbed since 1935 and this would mean it has never been climbed from the Nepalese side. This is perhaps remarkable because from Everest Base Camp, along with Pumori and Khumbutse (which have both been climbed), the mountain is very noticeable being less than away. An attempt on Lingtren was made in 2013. In Hoger dan de Dhaulagiri, claimed he had climbed Lingtren in 1993 saying he started in Nepal and then crossed into Tibet. This claim has, however, been discounted. Left to right: Lingtren-Khumbutse - Everest west shoulder.

Although significant early-to-mid 19th century buildings survive in the village, it was significantly damaged by a major fire in 1894, resulting in the construction of a number of new brick and wood frame buildings. The district, which is in size, includes 64 historically significant residential, civic, social, and commercial buildings, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The town of Norway, Maine, was incorporated in 1797, having been settled in the late 1780s. The village center grew on the north side of Pennesseewassee Stream, and is arrayed along Main Street, now designated Maine State Routes 117 and 118, east of a crossing of that stream. Side streets running perpendicular to Main Street are populated with housing, while Main Street is the focus of civic, commercial, and social activity. The major focal points of the district are the Universalist Church, at 45 Main Street, and the Norway Opera House, a brick structure with tower at 219 Main Street. The church was built in 1829, and renovated in the 1860s, giving it its present Italianate styling. The Opera House was built in 1894 in the wake of a devastating fire in May 1894, and became an anchor of the village. In addition to the Opera House, the village was home to a significant number of fraternal social organizations. The Knights of Pythias and International Order of Odd Fellows both built meeting halls in the village, as did the locally unique Weary Club, a social organization for the elderly. The principal civic buildings in the district are a small c. 1866 schoolhouse, the post office, and the library, the latter two being the two main representatives of Depression-era architecture. The residential architecture of the district is mainly 19th century in age. Notable houses include the Asa Danforth House (1830) at 136 Main Street, which is one of the finest brick Federal period houses in western Maine, the James Crooker House (c. 1860-65) at 19 Deering Street, which is a late example of Greek Revival architecture, and the Stephen and Edward Collins House (c. 1886), an architect designed Queen Anne Victorian at 9 Whitman Street. A notable 20th-century house is the Colonial Revival Edward Cummings House at 54 Deering Street, built in 1924 for a member of Norway's leading industrialists.

Early life Hoshi was born in Edo in what is now part of Tsukiji, Tokyo; little is known about his biological father other than that he was a plasterer. His mother remarried to a medical doctor in Uraga, and he adopted the Hoshi surname. Initially intending to pursue a career in medicine, he learned English at Yokohama, and eventually became an English language instructor. After the Meiji Restoration, he enjoyed the patronage of Mutsu Munemitsu and entered into the service of the new Meiji government, serving as head of the Yokohama Customs Office. At one point he precipitated a minor diplomatic incident over a disagreement with British minister Harry Smith Parkes over what kanji to use in translating the title of ‚Äúqueen‚Äù as in Queen Victoria, and refusing to agree to Parks position, resigned his post. He then travelled to England, where he studied at the Middle Temple, and in 1877 became the first Japanese to qualify as a barrister in the United Kingdom. page 283 On his return to Japan, Hoshi entered the Ministry of Justice, and was outspoken in his criticism of the hanbatsu, or clan-based politics, and what he perceived as the weak position of the Japanese government over the revision of the imequal treaties with the western powers. He was briefly expelled from Tokyo under the Peace Preservation Law and forbidden to publish in 1887 and jailed in 1888. Hoshi left Japan for the United States and Canada in 1888 soon after his release, remaining for a year, and continued on to England and Germany, only returning to Japan in 1890. In 1892, he was elected to the House of Representatives of Japan in the 1892 General Election under the Liberal Party and became Speaker of the House in May 1892.

Instead, Hoshi was appointed Communications Minister in the 4th It≈ç administration in October 1900. He also left the Keiseikai to join It≈ç‚Äôs Rikken Seiy≈´kai. page 36 However, the same month he was accused by the Mainichi Shimbun of involvement in a corruption scandal within the Tokyo City Assembly. Although he protested his innocence, he was forced to resign three months later due to a relentless campaign against his name by the newspaper. In March, he was found innocent due to lack of evidence, but during the middle of the trial he was assassinated by a middle-aged man with a short sword.

He specialized in echinoderms, particularly sea stars, sea urchins, and crinoids. He was one of the first European zoologists to have the opportunity to do research work in Japan from 1879 to 1881. Today, he is considered one of the most important pioneers of marine biological research in Japan. He was the director and curator of the Mus√©e zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg from 1882 to 1919. He headed the Zoologische Staatssammlung M√ºnchen from 1923 to 1927 and was Professor of Zoology in the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Biography Ludwig D√∂derlein was born in Bad Bergzabern on March 3, 1855. He went to school in Bayreuth from 1864 to 1873. Both places were then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. From 1873 to 1875 he studied natural sciences in the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, where he also worked as an assistant to the German zoologist Emil Selenka in the summer of 1875. From 1875 to 1876 he took two semesters at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. After graduating, D√∂derlein moved to Alsace (which had been annexed by Prussia at the end of the Franco-Prussian War). There he completed his Doctorate of Philosophy in Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Strasbourg on June 26, 1877. From 1876 to 1878 he worked for four semesters in the zoology department of the University of Strasbourg as an assistant to the German zoologist and phycologist Eduard Oscar Schmidt. The prospects for an academic career were poor, so for a time, he worked as a schoolteacher in the Alsatian town of Mulhouse. There he met and befriended the Japanese student Kenji Oosawa (1852-1927), who was studying medicine and physiology at the University of Strasbourg. Oosawa arranged for D√∂derlein to be invited to Japan to work as a Professor of Natural History in the Faculty of Medicine of the newly established University of Tokyo. D√∂derlein accepted gratefully. D√∂derlein was one of the first European academics invited to Japan during the Meiji Restoration era, when Japan was undergoing rapid modernization after the end of the isolation period (Sakoku). He stayed from 1879 to 1881 as an oyatoi gaikokujin (\\"foreign employee\\") professor. During this time, he collected and preserved marine life extensively, particularly fish, sponges, crustaceans, crinoids, sea urchins, cnidarians, and bryozoans. In addition, he also occasionally collected specimens of amphibians (including a giant salamander), mammals, birds, and plants. At first, he obtained most of his specimens from the fish markets and gift shops of Tokyo and the island of Enoshima. Later, he himself fished for specimens directly from Sagami Bay. At the end of the two- year period, D√∂derlein returned to Europe. Despite the difficulties associated with it, he brought his extensive collection of more than 3,550 specimens of at least 372 species back with him. After his return, D√∂derlein became the director and curator of Mus√©e zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg between 1882 and 1919. There he devoted much of his life cataloging its rich collection of marine fauna from the Far East. During his tenure, he hired specialists like Johannes Thiele, Franz Eilhard Schulze, and Arnold Edward Ortmann to study his Japanese collection. He also taught zoology at the University of Strasbourg during this period. At the turn of the century, he developed severe symptoms of tuberculosis. As a result, he was denied a promotion to Professor of Zoology because he could no longer teach effectively. From January to May 1901, in an effort to cure his ailment, he travelled to Biskra in Algeria where he spent most of his time studying the local fauna. After the end of the First World War in 1919, Alsace was ceded back to France by Germany under the Treaty of Versailles. D√∂derlein was removed from directorship of the Museum of Strasbourg and was deported back to Germany by the French government. His family were not allowed to take anything with them per the treaty, forcing him to leave all his private property as well as his Japanese zoological collection behind. To make matters worse, Germany (then under the Weimar Republic) was struggling from the post-war economic depression. He spent the rest of his life heading the Zoologische Staatssammlung M√ºnchen (Bavarian State Collection of Zoology) and teaching zoology in the University of Munich. He made numerous attempts to recover his Japanese collection but despite strong international support (including from the Smithsonian) he had little success. He also attempted to visit Strasbourg personally but was again thwarted by the growing hostility between Germany and France prior to the Second World War. He died in Munich on April 23, 1936 at the age of 81. Legacy D√∂derlein is considered as one of the last \\"great naturalists\\". His published work were varied, including papers on evolution, tapirs, elephants, and even pterosaurs. Most of his work, however, was on marine biology, with a special interest in echinoderms. He was mostly forgotten during the mid-Twentieth century until the rediscovery of his extensive collections at the Mus√©e zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg by the Japanese marine biologist Shunsuke Mawatari. From 1997 to 2005, a Japanese team documented his collections in Strasbourg and other museums in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, revealing the true extent of his work. He is now recognized as one of the pioneers of natural history research in Japan. He also started the long tradition of focused research on the ecologically rich Sagami Bay. His observations on its fauna is believed to have been the primary reason for the establishment of the Misaki Marine Biological Station in Sagami Bay in 1884 by the Japanese zoologist Kakichi Mitsukuri.

Jan Pieter‚Äôs cavalry pieces are characterized by their lively palette and relatively loose brushwork.

Consisting of musicians from several bands, they have been recreating the music of Pink Floyd in the Midwest since 1999. Created by members of the band Stir (Kevin Gagnepain, Brad Booker, Andy Schmidt) and singer Mark Quinn, El Monstero has become recognized as a holiday tradition with many St. Louisans, with 5 to 7 shows at The Pageant Theater selling out every Christmas season. The first El Monstero Pink Floyd tribute show was held November 27, 1999 at Mississippi Nights by the members of Stir. The band was between album cycles and decided as a way to make some extra money they'd book a cover band show, calling themselves \\"El Monstero Y Los Masked Avengers.\\" Initially they played many cover songs, but focused on Pink Floyd tunes (due to mutual appreciation). From there, the concerts became an annual tradition while the band was on holiday touring breaks, growing in both band members, production, and location over the years. Recently, the band has added shows in Kansas City and Springfield, MO in January and a summer show in St. Louis in various large venues, including Jefferson Barracks Military Post in 2011, Verizon Wireless Amphitheater (later Hollywood Casino Amphitheater) in 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and Art Hill in Forest Park in 2014. The band also finds time to give back to the community. In 2014, they donated all proceeds from their Sunday evening show at the Pageant to local non-profit Crisis Aid International. One aspect of an El Monstero production is its size, sometimes utilizing upwards of 75 people to help complete the bands' vision of an authentic Pink Floyd concert. The setlist always contains selections from albums such as The Wall, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and Animals, but also can include tracks such as \\"Free Four\\", \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\". The band is the subject of the documentary El Monstero: The Movie, directed by St. Louis native Mark Halski.
