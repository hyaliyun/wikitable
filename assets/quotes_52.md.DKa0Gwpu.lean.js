Politics  The first \\"executive committee\\" of the administration assumed office on 26 August 1974, but the administration was officially established on 1 October 1974. The decision to establish it was \\"necessitated by the political reflection of the massive social change in the island\\". The executive committee was replaced by the first Turkish Cypriot cabinet on 8 October 1974. The administration kept Northern Cyprus under a state of emergency until 20 December 1974. The administration was nominally autonomous under the Republic of Cyprus, with the republic's constitution being in place. The president, Rauf Denkta≈ü, was called \\"Vice President and President of the Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration\\", with reference to the vice-presidential position reserved for Turkish Cypriots in the republic. The members of the parliament also kept their previous positions, representing districts like Paphos, which were now in the south. Within three months of its establishment, the administration created four new ministries to meet demands, these were the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Planning and Coordination, Ministry of Refugees and Rehabilitation and Ministry of Tourism. According to Andrew Borowiec, the immediate functioning of the administration was hindered by the heavy military presence on its territory. On August 30, when the administration had recently been unofficially established, there were reportedly 17 roadblocks between Famagusta and Nicosia.  Economy  The minister of Labor and Social Works of the administration was ƒ∞smet Kotak. The administration reorganized the customs of the port of Famagusta and reopened it on 6 September 1974. Initially, the Cypriot pound was used as the currency, but the severed ties with the Cypriot central bank and resulting monetary difficulties prompted the administration to switch to the Turkish lira. The Ercan International Airport, then called the Tymbou Airport, was opened to chartered flights and some 75,000 tons of citrus fruits grown in the territory were exported. Efforts were made to reopen the closed tourism establishments, and nine hotels were reopened until November 1974. With help from the Turkish Airlines, the Cyprus Turkish Airlines was established and started flights to Turkey by January 1975. The administration received great economic and administrative help from Turkey, which ran development programs headed by the ambassador, Ziya M√ºezzinoƒülu, and trained Turkish Cypriot officers. Under these programs, Ziraat Bank of Turkey functioned as the central bank under the administration. The connections of Northern Cyprus were established through Turkey, including mail and telephone lines, and a new postal system was set in place, with the officers being trained by their Turkish counterparts. The farms and livestock left behind by Greek Cypriots were \\"integrated\\" into the economy. Two state farms were established, one in Famagusta and the other in Morphou. More than 100 factories in the territory were incorporated into a company with public shares.  Society  The administration allowed Turkish military personnel who participated in the invasion to obtain Turkish Cypriot citizenship and settle in Northern Cyprus. The resettlement of displaced Turkish Cypriots from the south was overseen. Andrew Borowiec wrote that Turkey announced plans to settle 5000 farm workers in the island to take up the abandoned rural possessions of Greek Cypriots. This led to Greek and Greek Cypriot accusations that Turkey was purposefully changing the demographic structure of Cyprus.

She was the main twentieth century editor of the works of Henry Crabb Robinson. She was a Professor of English Language at University College, Reading, now the University of Reading, from 1908 to 1940, making her the first woman to be appointed to a chair at a British university-level institution. She was a proud Socialist and member of the Fabian society, active in various suffrage campaigns, and received an OBE for her efforts coordinating Reading's refugee programme during the Second World War. Birth, childhood, and family life Edith Julia Morley was born at 25 Craven Hill Gardens, Bayswater, central London, in 1875. The house belonged to her grandmother, and the family rented it from her. Morley was the fourth of six children to her mother Leah Reyser (1840-1926) and her father Alexander Morley (d. 1915), a surgeon-dentist. She describes her oldest brother as 'an invalid'. There were twenty-five years between the eldest and the youngest children. She recalled in her memoir that she had not liked being a girl, being impatient of the restrictions placed on her activities by Victorian notions of decorum, such as wearing gloves and a veil to preserve her complexion. The family home had nine bedrooms, and on Morley's 'coming-out dance' comfortably accommodated 250 people. The family had a telephone installed in 1903 or 1904, which Morley notes was earlier than most of their friends.  Education  From the age of five Morley was sent to a local kindergarten which was run by a natural history enthusiast, nicknamed 'Brownie' by the family. She spent 'long and happy hours' at the Natural History Museum, London, recalling a memorable experience of being asked to tea by the Director and helping him and his assistant identify shells. She wrote that she 'was fully convinced that they needed my assistance', and was pleased that her brother hadn't been similarly invited. She described it as a 'delightful and wonderful experience and one which filled me with self- importance'. Morley received a good education. Her father wanted her to be educated at home by a governess, but she insisted on being sent to school. She was sent to Boarding School for three years and was then educated at Doreck College, Kensington, for four years. At the age of 14, she was sent to Hanover to learn German and to be 'turned into a 'young lady' and acquire some of the feminine accomplishments I refused to have anything to do with at home'. Her teaching was entirely in German, and she learned German, French, English Literature, universal history and history of art. She was not instructed in Latin, mathematics, or science, noting that absence would also have been reflected in private schools in England. In 1892, she took a course at Kings College London Ladies Department, where her abilities were noticed and it was suggested that she transfer to the Oxford Honour School of English and English Literature, alongside Caroline F. E. Spurgeon. Although she was placed in the first class following examination in 1899, women were not allowed to matriculate from Oxford at the time and she was awarded an 'equivalent' degree rather than a standard Oxford degree. Along with the few other women at Oxford University in that period, she was kept rather isolated, with limited access to the university's resources. She was later awarded an Associateship of King's College. In 1926 she was granted an Oxford honorary MA degree.  Career  Morley began teaching at King's College in 1899, taking a class in Gothic and Germanic philology. The difficulties Morley experienced getting an education helped to shape her political views towards Fabianism and she joined the Fabian Society around 1908 and became a member of the Fabian Executive Committee in 1914. She was also a champion of women's rights, arguing that marriage and motherhood were used to hold women back from professional careers. In her 1914 book Women Workers in Seven Professions, she describes how women academics tend to be found in restricted markets like women's colleges, creating a situation of artificial scarcity under which women are forced to compete against each other (rather than against both men and women) for the few available resources. Morley was an active although not an exhibitionist suffragist. She refused to pay her taxes in protest at having no vote and had her goods seized by the authorities. She also refused to take part in the 1911 census for the same reason and she spent the night of the census walking up and down Aldeburg High Street with Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. In 1908, Morley was appointed Professor of English Language at University College in Reading, thereby becoming the first woman appointed to a chair at an English university-level institution. She held this post until 1940, by which time the erstwhile University College had become the University of Reading. Her speciality was English literature, and for many years she regularly published a lengthy roundup of recent scholarship in her field under the heading \\"The Eighteenth Century\\" in the bibliographical review entitled The Year's Work in English Studies. She is known for her comprehensive 1935 biography of the writer and traveller Henry Crabb Robinson and as the primary 20th century editor of Robinson's writings.  Awards, honours and remembrance  In 1950, she was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), an honour awarded for her work setting up the Reading Refugee Committee and assisting Belgian Jewish refugees in World War II. For this work, she was included among the hundred or so women in Sybil Oldfield's book Doers of the Word: A Biographical Dictionary of British Women Humanitarians Active Between 1900‚Äì1950. The University of Reading holds a collection of her papers, including correspondence (1914‚Äì1939), lecture notebooks (1893‚Äì1914), photographs, and a memoir entitled Looking Before and After, which was published posthumously in 2016. In 2014, the university held her up as a role model during its celebration of International Women's Day. An annual lecture was established in her honour.

Thomas Turner (1749 ‚Äì February 1809) was an English potter. Biography Turner was born in 1749, was the eldest son of Richard Turner (1724?‚Äì1791), vicar of Elmley Castle, Worcestershire, by his wife Sarah. Richard Turner (1753‚Äì1788) was his younger brother. It has been supposed that Thomas was brought up as a silversmith. He was, however, only formally apprenticed to his father, to qualify him for the freedom of the city of Worcester. It is probable that he was early connected with the Worcester china works. He was an excellent chemist, was a thorough master of the various processes connected with porcelain manufacture, was a skillful draughtsman, designer, and engraver, and was also a clever musician. He was a magistrate for Shropshire and Staffordshire, and a freeman of Worcester, Much Wenlock, and Bridgnorth.L. Jewitt, The Ceramic Art of Great Britain from Pre- historic Times down to the Present Day, 2 Vols (Virtue & Co., London 1878), I, 'Caughley', pp. 264-273. The Old D.N.B. article was strongly indebted to this source, which should be read with caution. In 1772 Turner succeeded Ambrose Gallimore (brother-in-law of Josiah SpodeR. Copeland, Spode (Osprey Publishing, 1998), p. 4.) as lessee of the porcelain manufactory at Caughley in Shropshire. Gallimore had obtained the lease to the works, styled ‚ÄòThe Salopian China Warehouse,‚Äô in 1754, and under his management they had rapidly gained in repute. \\"In the early years of the Caughley manufactory, the ware was not many degrees removed from earthenware; but it gradually assumed a finer and more transparent character. Like the early Worcester examples, the patterns were principally confined to blue flowers, etc., on a white ground; and in this style and colour the Caughley works excelled, in many respects, their competitors.\\"Jewitt, The Ceramic Art of Great Britain from Pre-historic Times down to the Present Day, I, at pp. 266-67. On succeeding Gallimore, Turner set about enlarging the manufactory. He completed his improvements in 1775, and in 1780 visited France, in order to investigate the methods employed in the porcelain manufactories at Paris. He brought back several skilled workmen, who greatly aided him in his subsequent innovations. On his return he developed an early or predecessor form of the ‚Äòwillow pattern‚ÄôThis was not, however, the later standard willow pattern with bridge and fence in the foreground - which the Caughley factory never produced, see G.A. Godden, 'The Willow Pattern', The Antique Collector June 1972, pp. 148-50. (an imitation in transferware of a pattern popular in hand-painted chinese imported wares), and about the same time produced the ‚ÄòBrosely blue dragon pattern.‚Äô In 1783 Turner married Dorothy Gallimore, daughter of William and niece of Ambrose Gallimore.. Thomas Turner married Dorothy Gallimore at Barrow, Shropshire on 3 October 1783: she died in 1794. However she died and he made a second marriage. In 1798 or 1799 he retired from the business, which passed into the hands of John Rose, a former apprentice, who carried it on together with his own works at Coalport under the title Rose & Co. The works were finally abandoned in 1814 or 1815, chiefly owing to difficulties of transport and to the failure of the coal supply. Turner died in February 1809, and was buried in the family vault at Barrow. Family Turner was twice married: first, in 1783, Dorothy Gallimore. She died in 1793 without surviving issue; and he was married, secondly, in 1796, to Mary, daughter of Thomas Milner and widow of Henry Alsop. She died at Bridgnorth on 20 November 1816, leaving a son and daughter.

He is also the Chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Muslim League. He played a significant role in the 2010 Kashmir stone pelting rallies which broke out against the Machil encounter carried out by the Indian army in Kashmir. To stop such incidences Masrat Alam has been detained by the Government numerous times later. Government has booked Masrat Alam in 27 criminal cases but in most of these he has either been exonerated or bailed out by the courts and was released after Mufti Muhammad Sayeed took over as the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir on 1 March 2015. He was detained under the Jammu & Kashmir's Public Safety Act and was in March 2015 released which caused a major political controversy and dominated Indian Parliament Proceedings. Amid speculations over his release Masrat Aalam said that no deal was made between him and the Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, saying \\"I spent more than four years in prison and during all these years I challenged the grounds of my 'illegal' detention\\". He has been Jailed for 17 years and has around 27 cases against him. Indian authorities criticizes Masarat for being \\"New poster boy of ISI in Kashmir valley\\". Indian authorities claim that Pakistan is using Kashmiri leaders like Masarat Alam to erupt 2010-style confrontations between the youth and the Indian security forces which could lead to violence, so as to seek interest of the United States and European Union for mediation in Kashmir issue. Detention In 2010, he was on run after Indian govt announced a reward for his arrest for issuing protest calenders. Subsequently he was arrested later that year and remained in custody till early 2015. *He was arrested on 17 April 2015 by Kashmir police in Srinagar for raising Pakistan flag and shouting anti-India slogans. Syed Ali Shah Geelani has called for shutdown call for his arrest in Jammu and Kashmir on 18 April and some hurriyat supporters were doing protest against the arrest of Masarat Alam. In Budgam one protesting teenager boy who was claimed to be pelting stones was killed by CRPF firing which created tension in the Jammu and Kashmir. Again Public Safety Act has been invoked against him by Indian Government on 23 April. The valley saw sporadic clashes between Alam's supporters and the police. Protests were also held in some areas against his arrest, which has become the rallying point for separatists in Kashmir. The Jammu and Kashmir government has shifted Alam out of the valley to a jail in Jammu. Kashmiri separatists have called for shutdown on Saturday 25, 2015 in the valley against the detention of hardliner leader Masarat Alam under the Public Safety Act, a law that will allow the state to keep him in jail for two years without trial. * On 1 September 2015, he was detained again in jail premises after authorities released him following the Jammu and Kashmir High Court's order for releasing him. After Jammu jail authorities freed Masarat Alam following the court orders, a police party however, rearrested him and took him away to some unknown destination. The Jammu and Kashmir High Court quashed the detention of hardline separatist leader Masrat Alam under the Public Safety Act (PSA). Justice Hasnain Masoodi announced in open court that he has quashed the detention order issued by state government under the PSA against Masrat Alam and the detailed order would follow.http://www.abplive.in/crime/2015/08/21/article691182.ece/Kashmir-HC- quashes-Masrat-Alams-detention-under-PSA Many people believe that he could be a new leader in Jammu and Kashmir. Early life Alam was born in old-city Srinagar's Zaindar Mohalla in July 1971, Bhat studied in Srinagar's √©lite Cecil Earle Tyndale-Biscoe School before joining the Sri Pratap College. Like many youths of his generation, he was drawn to the jihadist movement that began in 1989. He was first arrested by the Border Security Force in October 1990 on charges of serving as a lieutenant to the then-prominent jihadist, Mushtaq Ahmad Bhat. He won a protracted legal battle in 1997 and began working at a cloth store owned by his grandfather, graduating the next year. From 1999, Bhat became increasingly active in the All Parties Hurriyat Conference(APHC) that cost him multiple stints in prison. He represented the Muslim League in APHC. Bhat found space under hardline Islamist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani's wing after the Hurriyat Conference split in 2003. Quotes Following are the quotes by Masarat Alam on various occasions. *\\"It is not only Indian administration (officials) who have a right to live in Jammu and Kashmir. We are sons of the soil and we have a right to live here. This is our land\\". *\\"The state has been using force against us for decades but it will not deter us from fighting for our goal. For us there is no difference in who is in the government. They are all same.\\" *\\"I'm a stone thrower since childhood.\\" Criticism and Controversies * Masarat Alam supported 2008 Mumbai Attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed. Alam, who responded by raising a series of anti-India and pro-Pakistan slogans, including those favouring militants like Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin (who is from Jammu and Kashmir and now in Pakistan administered), Azad Kashmir and LeT chief Hafiz Sayeed. \\"Hafiz Sayeed ka kya paigaam (What is Hafiz Sayeed‚Äôs message),\\" Alam shouted. \\"Kashmir banega Pakistan (Kashmir will become Pakistan).\\".http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jammu-kashmir/community/geelani- masarat-hold-anti-india-rally/68037.html *After Kashmir flood disaster, Masarat created a huge controversy by saying that Kashmir valley does not need Indian forces to rescue people in case of natural disasters. He said, \\"Our associates went to Badgam and Srinagar, we do not feel any kind of need. If disasters come, we do not need army and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). We think these are occupational forces so how would they bring relief? Last time, they did specific relief operation and rescued their own people. People here know that.\\" This statement has been criticised by media for being anti-Kashmiri and it may bring Kashmiri people in danger. *On 15 April 2015 he unfurled Pakistan flag in a rally in Srinagar and chanted pro-Pakistan slogans to greet Syed Ali Shah Geelani on his arrival in Srinagar from New Delhi which erupted huge controversy in Indian media. Later Jammu & Kashmir Police filed a case under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against Geelani and Masarat Alam for raising anti-national slogans. On 17 April Masarat Alam was arrested by Srinagar police. Jitendra Singh, Minister of State in Prime Minister's Office, said: \\"There's no compromise on any account, we are very clear on how such people have to be treated.\\" Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said, \\"Alam's arrest sends a strong message to the fringe groups. We will not tolerate any kind of anti- India activities.\\" However, Lashkar-e-Taiba founder and mastermind of 2008 Mumbai Attacks Hafiz Saeed congratulated Masarat for his \\"anti-India act\\" and held a rally in support of Masarat in Lahore on 17 April 2015. *Masarat has been criticized by media as \\"New poster boy of ISI in Kashmir valley\\". Indian authorities claim that Pakistan's game plan for Kashmir is to erupt 2010-style confrontations between the youth and the security forces by using leaders like Masarat Alam, so as to seek interest of the United States and European Union for mediation in Kashmir issue.

SS administration mug shot Zofia Posmysz- Piasecka (; born 23 August 1923) is a Polish journalist, novelist, and author. She was a resistance fighter in World War II and survived imprisonment at the Auschwitz and Ravensbr√ºck concentration camps. Her autobiographical account of the Holocaust in occupied Poland Passenger from Cabin 45 became the basis for her 1962 novel Passenger, subsequently translated into 15 languages. The original radio drama was adapted for an award-winning feature film, while the novel was adapted into an opera by the same title with music by Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg.  Early life  Posmysz was born in Krak√≥w and lived there until the invasion of Poland in 1939. During the occupation she attended clandestine courses and worked at a cable factory. She was arrested by the Gestapo in 1942, at age 19, charged with distributing anti-Nazi leaflets. She was kept for 6 weeks at the Montelupich Prison in Krak√≥w. After prolonged interrogation she was moved under escort to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Also in: . Relegated to arduous work at a penal company in Budy, she was saved twice by the camp doctor, Janusz MƒÖkowski. On 18 January 1945 Posmysz (prisoner number 7566) was sent to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp and from there to the Neustadt-Glewe satellite camp, where she was liberated on 2 May 1945 by the US Army.. Postwar life After World War II, she studied at the University of Warsaw, and worked for the broadcaster Polskie Radio in the culture section. In 1959, she wrote a radio drama, Pasa≈ºerka z kabiny 45 (Passenger from Cabin 45), based on her memories from the time spent in Nazi concentration camps. The play was produced in the same year by the Polish Radio featuring Aleksandra ≈ölƒÖska and Jan ≈öwiderski. It was adapted for television by Posmysz in 1960. The show was directed by Andrzej Munk and featured Ryszarda Hanin, Zofia Mrozowska, and Edward Dziewo≈Ñski in the leading roles. The Passenger from Cabin 45 was innovative and unusual in the genre of Holocaust literature, because it depicted a loyal SS Aufseherin, Annelise Franz, in charge of Posmysz's work detail at Auschwitz,. who nevertheless exhibited basic human behaviour towards prisoners. The screenplay for the film was written by both Posmysz and Munk in 1961.. Munk died in a car crash soon thereafter. Posmysz did not participate in the making of the film, which was released in 1963. Instead, she focused on writing a novel derived from her autobiographical memory. The book was published in 1962 as Pasa≈ºerka. The events in the book take place on an ocean liner, 16 years after the war ended. The former SS Aufseherin, Lisa Kretschmer, travels with her husband in search of a new life. Among the many passengers, she spots Marta, her former inmate, whom she used to feed and protect from dangerous labour. While at Auschwitz, Lisa was assigned to a new post of duty, and offered Marta to take her from the camp to detention in a less dangerous place, but to no avail. In the end of the novel, she learns that Marta recognized her also. Notably, in the original radio drama, the titular 'Cabin 45' was Posmysz's compartment number on a train to Auschwitz; an ocean-travel served as literary device of story within a story. No English translation of The Passenger novel exists. In 2015, Posmysz was among 19 Auschwitz survivors reporting for a documentary of Der Spiegel titled The Last Witnesses (Die letzten Zeugen). = Work and legacy = Posmysz went on writing continuously for over 30 years and wrote her last published book at the age of 73. She is best known for her 1959 autobiography Passenger in Cabin 45 (Pasa≈ºerka z kabiny 45) which led to a television play and film The Passenger by Andrzej Munk, who was one of the most influential artists of the post-Stalinist Poland. The director died during the screening in 1961, but the film was completed by his assistants, directors Andrzej Brzozowski and Witold Lesiewicz, and first released in 1963. The novel by Posmysz became the basis of the libretto by Alexander Medvedev for Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg's 1968 opera The Passenger, Op. 97\\\\. Suppressed for more than 40 years, it was first staged at Bregenz Festival on 21 July 2010, followed by the same production at the Grand Theatre in Warsaw. The opera by Weinberg premi√®red at the Lyric Opera of Chicago on 24 February 2015,Operatic trailer, 24 February ‚Äì 15 March 2015. with soprano Amanda Majeski as Marta. Die Passagierin was staged by the Frankfurt Opera in March 2015 with Leo Hussain conducting.

Foster and Stuart Anthony, and starring Billy Cook, Donald O'Connor, Porter Hall, Phil Warren, Janet Waldo, Elisabeth Risdon and William Haade. It was released on December 23, 1938, by Paramount Pictures. Plot Aunt Polly sends Tom and Huck to Arkansas to spend the summer with Tom's Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas Phelps. Unsuccessful lawyer Jeff Rutledge wants to marry Sally and Silas' daughter, Ruth, but wealthy Brace Dunlap also has eyes for her. At the end of the summer, Tom and Huck return to St. Petersburg to return to school. At the start of the following summer, Aunt Sally calls Tom and Huck back to help with the farm since Uncle Silas is in frail health. Aboard the steamship to Arkansas, Tom and Huck are approached by two men claiming to be detectives who ask for their help in finding out about a passenger. At first, Tom and Huck think the man in question is Jupiter Dunlap, the lazy oaf who was supposed to be working on Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas' farm. But the man confesses to being Jake Dunlap, Jupiter's twin brother, who was believed to have died. Jake is carrying two diamonds worth $20,000 inside the hollow heel of his boot and he is certain the \\"detectives\\" are actually a pair of thieves trying to rob and kill him. Tom and Huck help Jake disguise himself so he can slip off the boat during a stopover. At Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally's place, Tom and Huck learn Brace Dunlap has been spreading vicious gossip about Uncle Silas losing his mind. When Jupiter makes a crack about Uncle Silas allowing Ruth to marry white trash, Uncle Silas hits him over the head with a stick, temporarily knocking him out. Uncle Silas fears he's killed Jupiter and runs off. Recovering from the blow, Jupiter runs to Brace for help and assists him in killing Jake Dunlap, who is hiding out in a nearby cabin. Brace concocts a plan to dress Jake's body in Jupiter's clothes and dump him in the place where Uncle Silas assaulted Jupiter; this should ensure Uncle Silas will be accused of murder. The next morning, Brace drops by Uncle Silas' farm and asks to see Jupiter. When Uncle Silas tries to stonewall him, Brace threatens to get Sheriff Slocum involved. Tom and Huck borrow a bloodhound and go in search of Jupiter's body. The sheriff's posse is also hunting for the corpse. The bloodhound runs away and finds the body just as the sheriff and his men show up. Shortly afterward, Sheriff Slocum shows up at the house and arrests Silas for murder. The night before the trial, Tom and Huck attempt to help Uncle Silas escape from jail, but Aunt Sally refuses to let Uncle Silas leave. Jeff plans to defend Uncle Silas in court, although the outlook is bleak. Tom and Huck head to the graveyard to break into the Dunlap family crypt and open Jupiter's coffin. The gate of the crypt locks and they're trapped inside. At the trial, the prosecution calls the mysterious Kaylen Joshua Peters; he's actually Jupiter pretending to be a mute who witnessed Uncle Silas killing and burying Jupiter. After Tom and Huck escape the crypt, they encounter St. Louis sheriff Walker, who has arrested the two men Tom and Huck met on the boat. Sheriff Walker tells Tom and Huck there's a generous reward for the return of the stolen diamonds, and they rush off to the courthouse. Tom asks the judge to let him question Peters on the stand. At Tom's request, Sheriff Slocum removes the steel plate from the bottom of the boot Peters is wearing and the pair of diamonds are revealed. Tom then tells the court Jupiter Dunlap got his name from a collection of moles on his leg that looked like the planet Jupiter and its moons. Those moles were not on the body of the man in Jupiter Dunlap's grave. Peters tries in vain to flee the courthouse and then drops his act, telling the judge and jury Brace forced him to go along with the scheme. Jeff tells the judge Brace and Jupiter should be tried for killing and burying Jake Dunlap and trying to frame Uncle Silas for the murder. The case against Uncle Silas is dismissed and the courtroom erupts in cheers.

NAAA has a molecular weight of 31 kDa. The activation and inhibition of its catalytic site is of medical interest as a potential treatment for obesity and chronic pain. While it was discovered within the last decade, its structural similarity to the more familiar acid ceramidase (AC) and functional similarity to fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) allow it to be studied extensively. Mechanism The overall enzyme mechanism involves cleavage into two chains, one of which contains the catalytic nucleophile, believed to be a cysteine residue. Unlike FAAH, which operates in basic conditions, this enzyme must operate under acidic conditions (pH ~4.5), and is completely inactivated at a pH of 8. Selective inhibitors of NAAA are ester and amide compounds, such as N-cyclohexanecarbonylpentadecylamine. NAAA is cleaved proteolytically at residue Cys-126. NAAA cleaves C-N non-peptide bonds in linear amides, particularly ethanolamides. Its mechanism is quite similar to that of AC, which is further supported by AC's ability to cleave N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), albeit at far lower rates and with different specificities. While mechanistic details are not very well known, catalytic activity of NAAA is thought to be activated by Cys-126 and Asp-145. This is the speculated mechanism for the hydrolysis of ethanolamides by NAAA, which is very similar to that of acid ceramise. Structure Currently, there is little information about NAAA's tertiary structure, due to its low homology to any of the other enzymes in the choloylglycine hydrolase family for which there is significant 3-dimensional structural information. In humans, this enzyme contains 359 residues. NAAA's primary structure is nearly identical to that of acid ceramidase (AC), whose only difference is the substitution of Leu at the 334th residue, for phenylalanine. The enzyme must be N-glycosylated at six sites in order for the enzyme to operate at its maximum activity level, all of which have the peptide sequence, Asn-Xxx-Ser/Thr. Unlike AC, NAAA does not form a heterodimer through disulfide bonds, but rather remains active as two separate cleaved peptides following hydrolysis. Biological Function Fatty acid ethanolamines (FAEs) perform several physiological functions, most notably serving as messengers for pain and inflammation. NAAA's are found primarily in the lysosomal compartment of macrophages, in line with most inflammation- related proteins. The gene that codes for the protein is 4q21.1. There, they perform FAE hydrolysis, the final step in the signaling cascade for pain and inflammation, yielding an ethanolamine and a fatty acid. While it processes the cleavage of many different substrates, NAAA is most active with the substrate N-palmitoylethanolamine, suggesting that this is one of the key messengers of pain. NAAA activity in rats is highest in the lungs, while in humans it is highest in the liver, so there is cross-species variability in the enzyme's selective activity. Disease Relevance Recent studies suggest that NAAA has significance in two widespread human conditions: chronic pain and obesity. Current research focuses on inhibiting the NAAA hydrolytic active site in order to control inflammation. It is still ambiguous as to whether reduced inflammation is correlated to reduced pain. ARN077, a Œ≤-lactone, has been one of the most intensely tested NAAA inhibitors, with the strongest promise of inhibition, as it blocks the catalytic cysteine via a thioester bond. The lack of homology between NAAA and FAAH makes NAAA-specific targeting drugs far more feasible. However, because the fatty acid concentration circulating throughout one's bloodstream is positively correlated with obesity, decreased NAAA activity is thought to be correlated with obesity. This mechanism shows the inhibition of the catalytic cysteine by the most- tested Œ≤-lactone, ARN077. Industrial Relevance While no drugs targeting NAAA have entered the market yet, there is currently substantial research being done on the activation, and specific targeting and inhibition of NAAA. Activation of NAAA is spurred by the addition of phospholipids, and targeted inhibition by different buffers. Findings in these areas may be able to develop drugs to combat chronic pain and obesity. Evolution While NAAA operates much like fatty acid amide hydrolase (HUGO gene symbol: FAAH), the two enzymes are not homolgous. On the other hand, NAAA is homologous to acid ceramidase (HUGO gene symbol: ASAH1), sharing 30% sequence identity at the amino acid level in humans ENSEMBL. Historical significance NAAA was discovered in 2007 as an alternative source of anandamide hydrolysis. Previously, FAAH was the only known enzyme to be responsible for the degradation of these endocannabinoids, functioning in a pH range of 8.5-10. NAAA's discovery served as an explanation for endocannabinoids and anti- inflammatory ethanolamines in acidic environments, as its peak functionality is found at a pH ~4.5-5. Because of its functional role similar to FAAH, it offers another option for drug development.

Both before and after that ratification convention, he served in the New York Assembly, representing Dutchess County. Livingston had also been a member of the New York Provincial Congress. Early life Gilbert was one of the thirteen children of Henry Livingston, Sr. and Susanna Conklin Livingston. Gilbert's father, Henry, was County Clerk in Dutchess County, as well as a legislator in colonial New York. They were a middle-class family, and were members of a less affluent branch of the prominent Livingston family of New York.Wakelyn, Jon. Birth of the Bill of Rights: Biographies, pp. 121-123 (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004). One of Gilbert's great-grandfathers was the wealthy New York colonial official Robert Livingston the Elder, and one of Gilbert's siblings was the poet Henry Livingston, Jr. Gilbert was born and grew up near Poughkeepsie, and went to school in Fishkill, New York. He then went to King's College, which was the colonial-era name of Columbia College (New York), but left early (in 1757) due to a smallpox epidemic. Official records indicate that he was matriculated with the class of 1760. Career Livingston practiced law, owned a small farm with a few tenants, and ran a store in Poughkeepsie with the brother of prominent politician Melancton Smith. His law partners included the renowned jurist James Kent\\"Livingston, Gilbert\\", NYPL Rare Books and Manuscript division as well as Smith Thompson, who later married Livingston's daughter Sarah. In 1775, Livingston served in the New York Provincial Congress. During the American Revolution, he was a patriot, and worked in shipbuilding with his brother-in-law Peter Tappan, who happened to be the brother-in-law of Governor George Clinton. Livingston chaired an important wartime committee for Governor Clinton that dealt with the problem of inflation. Serving in the New York State Assembly from 1777-1778 and 1788-1789, he opposed price-fixing, supported tenants' rights, and warned against attempts by loyalists to gain power. He also was a judicial official called a \\"surrogate\\" from 1778 to 1785, and again from 1787 to 1794. =New York ratification convention= Livingston is now remembered most for his participation in the critical state convention, held in Poughkeepsie during the summer of 1788, that ratified the U.S. Constitution. The state convention in Poughskeepsie in June 1788 pitted Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, James Duane, Robert Livingston, and Richard Morris against the Clintonian faction led by Melancton Smith, John Lansing, Abraham Yates, and Gilbert Livingston.Denboer, Gordon R. (1987). The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections, 1788-1790, Volume III, p. 196.Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. . Hamilton's faction were against any conditional ratification, under the impression that New York would not be accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right to secede if their attempts failed. During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia became the ninth and tenth states to ratify the Constitution, respectively, which made any adjournment unlikely, and increased the odds of a compromise. During the debates in Poughkeepsie, Livingston expressed great skepticism about giving so much power to a federal government. He said that members of the U.S. Senate would be \\"strangers to the condition of the common people,\\" and that a state government would be sufficient to deal with the \\"depravity of human nature.\\" As to the power of the U.S. Senate to block treaties, Livingston took the position that Congress could get around the Senate as long as the treaty did not commit the United States for \\"a longer time\\" than the two-year duration of Congress. Livingston said he would only support ratification if amendments were made: \\"I will steadily persevere, in every possible means, to secure this desirable object, a revision of the Constitution.\\" Ultimately, he voted for ratification, confident that the desired amendments would eventually be approved. The vote in Poughkeepsie was thirty (30) to twenty-seven (27), which was the closest ratification vote of any state, with many delegates reluctant to break with Governor Clinton (who opposed ratification).Platt, Edmund. The Eagle's History of Poughkeepsie: From the Earliest Settlements 1683 to 1905, p. 61 (Platt & Platt, 1905). Livingston called his vote to ratify the most difficult political decision of his life, and he later felt vindicated once a bill of rights was proposed by Congress and ratified by the states. =Slavery= Livingston opposed slavery, and joined the Poughkeepsie branch of the New York Manumission Society in 1787.Country Journal and Poughkeepsie Advertiser (May 30, 1787). Personal life In 1763, he married Catherine Crannell (1745‚Äì1830), the daughter of law partner Bartholomew Crannell and Tryntje Van Kleeck. Gilbert and Catherine would have one child: * Sarah Livingston (1777‚Äì1833), who married Smith Thompson (1768‚Äì1843), a law partner of Gilbert and later the U.S. Secretary of the Navy and Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. After her death, he married Elizabeth Davenport Livingston (1805‚Äì1886), her cousin and the daughter of Gilbert's brother, Henry Livingston Jr. Livingston died on September 14, 1806.

It has small leaves and small greenish-yellow flowerheads.  Description  Melaleuca blaeriifolia usually grows to a height of or and is dense and intricately branched. Its leaves are egg-shaped to triangular, long and wide with a short stalk. Greenish-yellow flowers appear over an extended period, from August to November. They are in cylindrical or spherical heads of flowers either at the ends of branches or in leaf axils on older wood. The stamens, which give the flowers their colour, are arranged in five bundles around the flower and in this species, there are three to five stamens per bundle. The woody capsules which follow flowering are cylindrical, about wide and long, arranged singly or in small groups and the sepals remain as small teeth on the fruit.Melaleuca blaeriifolia (habit) Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1847 by the Russian botanist Nikolai Turczaninow in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale des Naturalistes de Moscou. The specific epithet (blaeriifolia) is derived from the name of a genus of plants Blaeria in the family Ericaceae, and the Latin folium for \\"leaf\\" in reference to the similarity of its leaves to those of plants in that genus. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs from the Manjimup district to the Pallinup River, including the Porongurup National Park in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions of Western Australia. It grows in sandy or clayey soils on granite outcrops and hillsides.

She was the first woman admitted to Spain's Gynecological Society. Concepci√≥n was born in Valencia in a wealthy family. Soon after graduating from high-school, she continued her studies at Escuela Normal Femenina de Valencia where she received her teaching degree, however, she would never end up teaching. Throughout her life, she maintained her constant desire and interest towards pedagogy. Aleixandre decided to follow a very unusual, unknown and unthinkable path for women at the time (usually condemned to domestic home jobs and child education), se inscribed herself in the Faculty of Medicine at Universidad de Valencia.Being one of the first women to choose this path, she had to confront many issues with the university's management, which at the end, accepted her inscription. Aleixandre coincided with Manuela Sol√≠s Clar√°s (1862-1910) in the Faculty of Medicine. Both graduated in 1889 with excellent grades (as happened with their Catalan colleagues). Of the 24 subjects, Aleixandre achieved 20 outstanding (one with prize and one with honor) and was the ninth Spanish woman to have a university degree (until then all in medicine). He specialized in gynecology, taking a doctorate in Madrid, where he developed his professional activity. She was an auxiliary doctor at the Hospital de la Princesa (1891) and at the Provincial House of Maternity and Inclusa (1902). In addition, she opened a private clinic, first (1890) at her own address in Salustiano de Ol√≥zaga Street, where she attended poor women for free, and then in Argensola (1906), Serrano (1915) and N√∫√±ez de Balboa (1927), where she attended in prepared rooms and adapted schedules for people of different economic possibilities. Her attention became famous because of his warmth and closeness with the patients and their children, who could go to the office to hundreds in a single day. In 1910, Aleixandre registered a patent (n¬∫ 47109) in favor of two metal pessaries of reducible rings. The pessary is a device that is placed in the vagina to correct the descent or prolapse of the uterus, usually as a result of childbirth. This instrument allows the matrix to be supported by supporting the abdominal viscera that affect the organ. Its effect is, therefore, similar to that of the trusses to contain hernias or to the candles that separate the walls of the urethra. According to Aleixandre in the specification of his patent, the pessary was an instrument commonly used in the toco-genecology of the time and was combined with other procedures (replacement of the prolapse matrix, kneading adhesions or relaxed tissues, electrical strip, electrotherapy or cold baths), also serving to avoid surgical intervention and prevent pathologies such as fibrous degenerations, tubal abnormalities or serious inflammations. Also, Aleixandre points out the inconveniences (infections and bad smell) of the soft pessary designed in rubber by the French gynaecologist Am√©d√©e Dumontpallier (1826-1899). The device invented by the Spanish doctor was the result of her own clinical experiences and consisted of a ring whose body was made of aluminum and wore nickel plated steel springs that provided sufficient elasticity for easy insertion into the vagina without having to tear the vulva and without sliding out once introduced. In addition, the system was offered in two models of different design and size depending on whether they were narrow or dilated cavities and more or less lax walls, being explained through drawings the way to use them and being very simple cleaning through boiling and the use of antiseptic substances. However, this patent did not pass the mandatory procedure of its implementation and ended expired in 1912. Still, it is likely that he used his invention in his usual optional work. She belonged to several women's organizations which advocated for the advancing of women's rights. Her written work is mostly known from her published articles in journals and conferences, as well as speeches given at scientific meetings. In 2001, Aleixandre was one of the selectees for \\"100 women of the twentieth century who paved the way for equality in the 21st century women\\".Consejo de la Mujer (2001). 100 mujeres del siglo XX que abrieron camino a la igualdad en el siglo XXI.

Metal-framed domes of the 19th century often imitated earlier masonry dome designs in a variety of styles, especially in church architecture, but were also used to create glass domes over shopping arcades and hothouses, domes over locomotive sheds and exhibition halls, and domes larger than any others in the world. The variety of domed buildings, such as parliaments and capitol buildings, gasometers, observatories, libraries, and churches, were enabled by the use of reinforced concrete ribs, lightweight papier-m√¢ch√©, and triangulated framing. In the 20th century, planetarium domes spurred the invention by Walther Bauersfeld of both thin shells of reinforced concrete and geodesic domes. The use of steel, computers, and finite element analysis enabled yet larger spans. Tension membrane structure became popular for domed sports stadiums, which also innovated with rigid retractable domed roofs.  Nineteenth century Developments=Materials New production techniques allowed for cast iron and wrought iron to be produced both in larger quantities and at relatively low prices during the Industrial Revolution. Most iron domes were built with curved iron ribs arranged radially from the top of the dome to a ring at the base. The material of choice for domes changed over the course of the 19th century from cast iron to wrought iron to steel. Excluding domes that simply imitated multi-shell masonry, the century's chief development of the simple domed form may be metal framed domes such as the circular dome of Halle au Bl√© in Paris and the elliptical dome of Royal Albert Hall in London. The practice of building rotating domes for housing large telescopes was became popular in the 19th century, with early examples using papier-m√¢ch√© to minimize weight. Although domes made entirely from reinforced concrete were not built before 1900, the church of Saint-Jean- de-Montmartre was designed by Anatole de Baudot with a small brick shell dome with reinforced concrete ribs. Structure According to Irene Giustina, dome construction was one of the most challenging architectural problems until at least the end of the 19th century, due to a lack of knowledge about statics. By the 1860s and 1870s, German and other European engineers began to treat iron domes as collections of short straight beams with hinged ends, resulting in light openwork structures. Other than in glasshouses, these structures were usually hidden behind ceilings. Proportional rules for an arch's thickness to span ratio were developed during the 19th century, based on catenary shape changes in response to weight loads, and these were applied to the vertical forces in domes. Edmund Beckett Denison, who had published a proof on the subject in 1871, wrote in a Domes article in the Ninth Edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica that the thickness to span ratio was lower for a dome than it was for an arch due to the more distributed loads of a dome. The large domes of the 19th century included exhibition buildings and functional structures such as gasometers and locomotive sheds. The span of the ancient Pantheon dome, although matched during the Renaissance, remained the largest in the world until the middle of the 19th century. Style The historicism of the 19th century led to many domes being re-translations of the great domes of the past, rather than further stylistic developments, especially in sacred architecture. The Neoclassical style popular at this time was challenged in the middle of the 19th century by a Gothic Revival in architecture, in what has been termed the \\"Battle of the Styles\\". This lasted from about 1840 to the beginning of the 20th century, with various styles within Classicism, such as Renaissance, Baroque, and Rococo revivals, also vying for popularity. The last three decades of this period included unusual combinations of these styles. =Religious and royal buildings= Kazan Cathedral and Saint Isaac's Cathedral (background) in Russia. Iron domes offered the lightness of timber construction along with incombustibility and higher strength, allowing for larger spans. Because domes themselves were relatively rare, the first examples made from iron date well after iron began to be used as a structural material. Iron was used in place of wood where fire resistance was a priority. In Russia, which had large supplies of iron, some of the earliest examples of the material's architectural use can be found. Andrey Voronikhin built a large wrought iron dome over Kazan Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Built between 1806 and 1811, the 17.7 meter wide outer dome of the cathedral was one of the earliest iron domes. The iron outer dome covers two masonry inner domes and is made of 15 mm thick sheets set end to end. An early example from Britain is within the fanciful iron-framed dome over the central building of the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, begun in 1815 by John Nash, the personal architect of King George IV. The dome was not one of the prominent onion domes but instead the dome-like structure of twelve cast iron ribs resting on cast iron columns over Henry Holland's earlier saloon. It was completed in 1818-1819. The neoclassical Baltimore Basilica, designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe after the Roman Pantheon for Bishop John Carroll, was begun in 1806 and dedicated in 1821, although the porch and towers would not be completed until the 1870s. An influence on the interior design may have been the Church of St. Mary in East Lulworth, England, where Bishop Carroll had been consecrated. The central dome is 72 feet in diameter and 52 feet above the nave floor. The onion domes over the two towers were built according to Latrobe's designs. The church was extended to the east by 33 feet in 1890. Before initial construction of the church was completed, two other neoclassical domed churches would be built in Baltimore. The First Independent (Unitarian) Church by Maximilian Godefroy was begun in 1817 and covered the interior space with a 55 foot wide shallow coffered dome on pendentives with an oculus at the center. To improve acoustics, the interior was modified. The First Baptist Church by Robert Mills, also known as \\"Old Red Top Church\\", was a domed cylindrical rotunda with a porch block and portico. The dome had a shallow exterior profile and its oculus was covered by a low lantern, called a monitor. It was completed in 1818 but demolished in 1878. In 1828, the eastern crossing tower of Mainz Cathedral was rebuilt by Georg Moller with a wrought iron dome. The dome was made of flat iron sections and reinforced with ties that passed through the interior of the dome. Such dome reinforcement was one of the two established techniques, the other being the use of a combination of horizontal rings and vertical ribs. The span may have been about 27 meters. It was later removed in favor of the current structure. Large neoclassical domes include the Rotunda of Mosta in Malta, was completed in 1840 with a dome 38 meters wide, and San Carlo al Corso in Milan, completed in 1847 with a dome 32 meters wide. Saint Isaac's Cathedral, in Saint Petersburg, was built by 1842 with one of the largest domes in Europe. A cast iron dome nearly 26 meters wide, it had a technically advanced triple-shell design with iron trusses reminiscent of St. Paul's Cathedral in London. The design for the cathedral was begun after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 and given to a French architect, but construction was delayed. Although the dome was originally designed to be masonry, cast iron was used instead. Also reminiscent of St. Paul's dome and that of the Panth√©on in Paris, both of which the original designer had visited, the dome of St. Nicholas' Church in Potsdam was added to the building from 1843-49. A dome was included as a possibility in the original late Neoclassical design of 1830, but as a wooden construction. Iron was used instead by the later architects. Other examples of framed iron domes include those of a synagogue in Berlin, by Schwedler in 1863, and the Bode Museum by Muller-Breslau in 1907. The wrought-iron dome of Royal Albert Hall in London was built from 1867 to 1871 over an elliptical plan by architect Henry Young Darracott Scott and structural design by Rowland Mason Ordish. It uses a set of curved trusses, like those of the earlier New Street Station in Birmingham, interrupted in the middle by a drum. The elliptical dome's span is 66.9 meters by 56.5 meters. The wrought-iron dome of St. Augustin's church in Paris dates from 1870 and spans 25.2 meters. A wrought-iron dome was also built over Jerusalem's Holy Sepulchre in 1870, spanning 23 meters. The dome over the Basilica of San Gaudenzio (begun in 1577) in Novara, Italy, was built between 1844 and 1880. Revisions by the architect during construction transformed what was initially going to be a drum, hemispherical dome, and lantern 42.22 meters tall into a structure with two superimposed drums, an ogival dome, and a thirty meter tall spire reaching 117.5 meters. The architect, Alessandro Antonelli, who also built the Mole Antonelliana in Turin, Italy, combined Neoclassical forms with the vertical emphasis of the Gothic style. A large dome was built in 1881‚Äì1882 over the circular courtyard of the Devonshire Royal Hospital in England with a diameter of 156 feet. It used radial trussed ribs with no diagonal ties. The dome of Pavia Cathedral, a building started in 1488, was completed with a large octagonal dome joined to the basilica plan of the church. =Commercial buildings= Although iron production in France lagged behind Britain, the government was eager to foster the development of its domestic iron industry. In 1808, the government of Napoleon approved a plan to replace the burnt down wooden dome of the Halle au Bl√© granary in Paris with a dome of iron and glass, the \\"earliest example of metal with glass in a dome\\". The dome was 37 meters in diameter and used 51 cast iron ribs to converge on a wrought iron compression ring 11 meters wide containing a glass and wrought iron skylight. The outer surface of the dome was covered with copper, with additional windows cut near the dome's base to admit more light during an 1838 modification. Cast-iron domes were particularly popular in France. In the United States, an 1815 commission to build the Baltimore Exchange and Custom House was awarded to Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Maximilian Godefroy for their design featuring a prominent central dome. The dome design was altered during construction to raise its height to 115 feet by adding a tall drum and work was completed in 1822. Signals from an observatory on Federal Hill were received at an observation post in the dome, providing early notice of arriving merchant vessels. The building was demolished in 1901-2. The Coal Exchange in London, by James Bunning from 1847-1849, included a dome 18 meters wide made from 32 iron ribs cast as single pieces. It was demolished in the early 1960s. Large temporary domes were built in 1862 for London's International Exhibition Building, spanning 48.8 meters. The Leeds Corn Exchange, built in 1862 by Cuthbert Brodrick, features an elliptical plan dome 38.9 meters by 26.7 meters with wrought iron ribs along the long axis that radiate from the ends and others spanning the short axis that run parallel to each other, forming a grid pattern. The Galleria Umberto I in Italy. Elaborate covered shopping arcades, such as the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan and the Galleria Umberto I in Naples, included large glazed domes at their cross intersections. The dome of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (1863‚Äì1867) rises to 145 feet above the ground and has the same span as the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, with sixteen iron ribs over an octagonal space at the intersection of two covered streets. It is named after the first king of a united Italy. Vladimir Shukhov was an early pioneer of what would later be called gridshell structures and in 1897 he employed them in domed exhibit pavilions at the All-Russia Industrial and Art Exhibition. The dome of Sydney's Queen Victoria Building uses radial ribs of steel along with redundant diagonal bracing to span 20 meters. It was claimed to be the largest dome in the Southern Hemisphere when completed in 1898. =Greenhouses and conservatories= Iron and glass glasshouses with curved roofs were popular for a few decades beginning shortly before 1820 to maximize orthogonality to the sun's rays, although only a few have domes. The conservatory at Syon Park was one of the earliest and included a 10.8 meter span iron and glass dome by Charles Fowler built between 1820 and 1827. The glass panes are set in panels joined by copper or brass ribs between the 23 main cast iron ribs. Another example was the conservatory at Bretton Hall in Yorkshire, completed in 1827 but demolished in 1832 upon the death of the owner. It had a 16 meter wide central dome of thin wrought iron ribs and narrow glass panes on a cast iron ring and iron columns. The glass acted as lateral support for the iron ribs. The Antheum at Brighton would have had the largest span dome in the world in 1833 at 50 meters but the circular cast-iron dome collapsed when the scaffolding was removed. Unique glass domes springing straight from ground level were used for hothouses and winter gardens, such as the Palm house at Kew (1844-48) and the Laeken winter garden near Brussels (1875‚Äì1876). The Laeken dome spans the central 40 meters of the circular building, resting on a ring of columns. The Kibble Palace of 1865 was re- erected in 1873 in an enlarged form with a 16 meter wide central dome on columns. The Palm House at Sefton Park in Liverpool has an octagonal central dome, also 16 meters wide and on columns, completed in 1896. =Libraries= The British Museum Library constructed a new reading room in the courtyard of its museum building between 1854 and 1857. The round room, about 42.6 meters in diameter and inspired by the Pantheon, was surmounted by a dome with a ring of windows at the base and an oculus at the top. Hidden iron framing supported a suspended ceiling made of papier-m√¢ch√©. A cast iron dome was built between 1860 and 1867 over the reading room of the Biblioth√®que nationale in Paris. Inspired by the prestigious British Museum reading room, the first iron dome in Canada was built in the early 1870s over the reading room of the Library of Parliament building in Ottawa. Unlike the British Museum room, the library, which opened in 1876, uses the Gothic style. The dome of the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress, also inspired by the reading room dome at the British Museum, was built between 1889 and 1897 in a classical style. It is 100 feet wide and rises 195 feet above the floor on eight piers. The dome has a relatively low external profile to avoid overshadowing the nearby United States Capitol dome. =Legislative buildings= The United States Capitol. The Hungarian Parliament Building. The design for the United States' national capitol building approved by George Washington included a dome modeled on the Pantheon, with a low exterior elevation. Subsequent design revisions resulted in a double dome, with a raised external profile on an octagonal drum, and construction did not begin until 1822. The interior dome was built of stone and brick except for the upper third, which was made of wood. The exterior dome was wooden and covered with copper sheeting. The dome and building were completed by Charles Bulfinch in 1829. Most of the 50 state capitol buildings or statehouses with domes in the United States cover a central rotunda, or hall of the people, due to the use of a bicameral legislature. The Pennsylvania capitol building designed by Stephen Hills in Harrisburg was the earliest to combine all the elements that would subsequently become characteristic of state capitol buildings: dome, rotunda, portico, and two legislative chambers. Like the design of the national capitol, the design was chosen through a formal competition. Early domed state capitol buildings include those of North Carolina (as remodeled by William Nichols), Alabama (in Tuscaloosa), Mississippi, Maine (1832), Kentucky, Connecticut (in New Haven), Indiana, North Carolina (as rebuilt), Missouri (very similar to Hills' Harrisburg design), Minnesota (later rebuilt), Texas, and Vermont (1832). The current dome over the United States Capitol building, although painted white and crowning a masonry building, is made of cast iron. The dome was built between 1855 and 1866, replacing a lower wooden dome with copper roofing from 1824. It has a 30-meter diameter. It was completed just two years after the Old St. Louis County Courthouse, which has the first cast iron dome built in the United States. The initial design of the capitol dome was influenced by a number of European church domes, particularly St. Paul's in London, St. Peter's in Rome, the Panth√©on in Paris, Les Invalides in Paris, and St. Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg. The architect, Thomas U. Walter, designed a double dome interior based on that of the Panth√©on in Paris. Dome construction for state capitol buildings and county courthouses in the United States flourished in the period between the American Civil War and World War I. Most capitols built between 1864 and 1893 were landmarks for their cities and had gilded domes. Examples from the Gilded Age include those of California, Kansas, Connecticut, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Wyoming, Michigan, Texas, and Georgia. Many American state capitol building domes were built in the late 19th or early 20th century in the American Renaissance style and cover rotundas open to the public as commemorative spaces. Examples include the Indiana State House, Texas State Capitol, and the Wisconsin State Capitol. American Renaissance capitols also include those of Rhode Island and Minnesota. The Reichstag Palace, built between 1883 and 1893 to house the Parliament of the new German Empire, included a dome made of iron and glass as part of its unusual mixture of Renaissance and Baroque components. Controversially, the 74 meter tall dome stood seven meters taller than the dome of the Imperial Palace in the city, drawing criticism from Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Hungarian Parliament Building was built in the Gothic style, although most of the 1882 design competition entries used Neo-Renaissance, and it includes a domed central hall. The large, ribbed, egg-shaped dome topped with a spire was influenced by the dome of the Maria vom Siege church in Vienna. It has a sixteen sided outer shell with an iron skeleton that rises 96 meters high, and an inner shell star vault supported on sixteen stone pillars. The Dome Hall is used to display the coronation crown of Hungary and statuary of monarchs and statesmen. The dome was structurally complete by the end of 1895. =Industrial buildings= The \\"first fully triangulated framed dome\\" was built in Berlin in 1863 by Johann Wilhelm Schwedler in a gasometer for the Imperial Continental Gas Association and, by the start of the 20th century, similarly triangulated frame domes had become fairly common. Schwedler built three wrought-iron domes over gasholders in Berlin between 1876 and 1882 with spans of 54.9 meters, one of which survives. Six similar Schwedler-type domes were used over gasholders in Leipzig beginning in 1885 and in Vienna using steel, in the 1890s. Rather than using traditional iron ribs, the domes consist of a thinner arrangement of short straight iron bars connected with pin joints in a lattice shell, with cross-bracing provided by light iron rods.  Twentieth century Developments= American state capitol domes built in the twentieth century include those of Arizona, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Idaho, Kentucky, Utah, Washington, Missouri, and West Virginia. The West Virginia capitol building has been called the last American Renaissance capitol. Stand-alone dome structures were used to house public utility facilities in the 20th century. The \\"Fitzpatrick dome\\", designed by John Fitzpatrick as an inexpensive structure to store winter road service sand and salt, has been used in countries around the world. The first was built in 1968. The domes have twenty sides and are normally 100 feet in diameter and a little more than 50 feet tall. The conical shape is meant to conform to the 45 degree slope of a pile of wet sand. They are built on concrete footings and covered with asphalt shingles. Wooden domes in thin-wall shells on ribs were made until the 1930s. After World War II, steel and wooden laminate structural members made with waterproof resorcinol glues were used to create domes with grid-patterned wooden support structures, such as the 100 meter diameter Skydome in Flagstaff, Arizona. = Guastavino tile = In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Guastavino family, a father and son team who worked on the eastern seaboard of the United States, further developed the masonry dome. They perfected a traditional Spanish and Italian technique for light, center-less vaulting using layers of tiles in fast-setting cement set flat against the surface of the curve, rather than perpendicular to it. The father, Rafael Guastavino, innovated with the use of Portland cement as the mortar, rather than the traditional lime and gypsum mortars, which allowed mild steel bar to be used to counteract tension forces. His use of the recent development of graphic statics enabled him to design and build inexpensive funicular domes with minimal thickness and no scaffolding. The vaults were typically 3 inches thick and workers, standing on the completed portions, used simple templates, wires, and strings to align their work. The family built vaults in hundreds of buildings, including the domes of the Basilica of St. Lawrence in Asheville, North Carolina, and St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The dome over the crossing of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City was built by the son in 1909. A part- spherical dome, it measures 30 meters in diameter from the top of its merging pendentives, where steel rods embedded in concrete act as a restraining ring. With an average thickness 1/250th of its span, and steel rods also embedded within the pendentives, the dome \\"looked forward to modern shell construction in reinforced concrete.\\" = Steel and concrete = The Kresge Auditorium in Massachusetts. Domes built with steel and concrete were able to achieve very large spans. The West Baden Springs Hotel in Indiana was built in 1903 with the largest span dome in the world at 200 feet. Its metal and glass skin was supported by steel trusses resting on metal rollers to allow for expansion and contraction from temperature changes. It was surpassed in span by the Centennial Hall of Max Berg. The 1911 dome of the Melbourne Public Library reading room, presumably inspired by the British Museum, had a diameter of 31.5 meters and was briefly the widest reinforced concrete dome in the world until the completion of the Centennial Hall. The Centennial Hall was built with reinforced concrete in Breslau, Germany (today Poland), from 1911-13 to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the uprising against Napoleon. With a 213 foot wide central dome surrounded by stepped rings of vertical windows, it was the largest building of its kind in the world. Other examples of ribbed domes made entirely of reinforced concrete include the Methodist Hall in Westminster, London, the Augsburg Synagogue, and the Orpheum Theater in Bochum. The 1928 Leipzig Market Hall by Deschinger and Ritter featured two 82 meter wide domes. The thin domical shell was further developed with the construction of two domes in Jena, Germany in the early 1920s. To build a rigid planetarium dome, Walther Bauersfeld constructed a triangulated frame of light steel bars and mesh with a domed formwork suspended below it. By spraying a thin layer of concrete onto both the formwork and the frame, he created a 16 meter wide dome that was just 30 millimeters thick. The second dome was still thinner at 40 meters wide and 60 millimeters thick. These are generally taken to be the first modern architectural thin shells. These are also considered the first geodesic domes. Beginning with one for the Deutsches Museum in Munich, 15 domed projection planetariums using concrete shells up to 30 meters wide had been built in Europe by 1930, and that year the Adler Planetarium in Chicago became the first planetarium to open in the Western Hemisphere. Planetarium domes required a hemispherical surface for their projections, but most 20th century shell domes were shallow to reduce the material costs, simplify construction, and reduce the volume of air needing to be heated. Although an equation for the bending theory of a thick spherical shell had been published in 1912, based on general equations from 1888, it was too complex for practical design work. A simplified and more approximate theory for domes was published in 1926 in Berlin. The theory was tested using sheet metal models with the conclusion that the membrane stresses in domes are small with little reinforcement required, especially at the top, where openings could be cut for light. Only the concentrated stresses at point supports required heavy reinforcement. Early examples used a relatively thick bordering girder to stabilize exposed edges. Alternative stabilization techniques include adding a bend at these edges to stiffen them or increasing the thickness of the shell itself at the edges and near the supports. In 1933-34, Spanish engineer-architect Eduardo Torroja, with Manuel Sanchez, designed the Market Hall in Algeciras, Spain, with a thin shell concrete dome. The shallow dome is 48 meters wide, 9 centimeters thick, and supported at points around its perimeter. The indoor stadium for the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin used an oval dome of concrete shell 35 meters wide and 45 meters long. Popularized by a 1955 article on the work of F√©lix Candela in Mexico, architectural shells had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, peaking in popularity shortly before the widespread adoption of computers and the finite element method of structural analysis. Notable examples of domes include the Kresge Auditorium at MIT, which has a spherical shell 49 meters wide and 89 millimeters thick, and the Palazzetto dello Sport, with a 59 meter wide dome designed by Pier Luigi Nervi. The use of metal structures in Italy was reduced in the first half of the 20th century by autarchy and the demands of the world wars. Steel became broadly used in building construction in the 1930s. A shortage of steel following World War II and the demonstrated vulnerability of exposed steel to damage from intense fires during the war may have contributed to the popularity of concrete architectural shells beginning in the late 1940s. In the 1960s, improvements in welding and bolting techniques and higher labor costs made steel frames more economical. = Geodesic domes = Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. Structurally, geodesic domes are also considered shells when the loads are borne by the surface polygons, as in the Kaiser Dome, but are considered space grid structures when the loads are borne by point-to-point members. A geodesic dome made of welded steel tubes was made in 1935 for the aviary of the Rome Zoo. Although the first examples were built 25 years earlier by Walther Bauersfeld, the term \\"geodesic domes\\" was coined by Buckminster Fuller, who received a patent for them in 1954. Geodesic domes have been used for radar enclosures, greenhouses, housing, and weather stations. Early examples in the United States include a 53-foot-wide dome for the Ford Rotunda in 1953 and a 384-foot-diameter dome for the Baton Rouge facility of the Union Tank Car Company in 1958, the largest clear-span structure in the world at that time. The U.S. Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, was enclosed by a 76.5-meter-wide and 60-meter-tall dome made of steel pipes and acrylic panels. It is used today as a water monitoring center. Other examples include the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, which was used from 1975 to 2003, and the Eden Project in the UK, built in 2000. = Tension and membranes = The Millennium Dome in the UK. Tensegrity domes, patented by Buckminster Fuller in 1962 from a concept by Kenneth Snelson, are membrane structures consisting of radial trusses made from steel cables under tension with vertical steel pipes spreading the cables into the truss form. They have been made circular, elliptical, and other shapes to cover stadiums from Korea to Florida. While the first permanent air supported membrane domes were the radar domes designed and built by Walter Bird after World War II, the temporary membrane structure designed by David Geiger to cover the United States pavilion at Expo '70 was a landmark construction. Geiger's solution to a 90% reduction in the budget for the pavilion project was a \\"low profile cable-restrained, air-supported roof employing a superelliptical perimeter compression ring\\". Its very low cost led to the development of permanent versions using teflon-coated fiberglass and within 15 years the majority of the domed stadiums around the world used this system, including the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. The restraining cables of such domes are laid diagonally to avoid the sagging perimeter found to occur with a standard grid. Tension membrane design has depended upon computers, and the increasing availability of powerful computers resulted in many developments being made in the last three decades of the 20th century. Weather-related deflations of some air-supported roofs led David Geiger to develop a modified type, the more rigid \\"Cabledome\\", that incorporated Fuller's ideas of tensegrity and aspension rather than being air-supported. The pleated effect seen in some of these domes is the result of lower radial cables stretching between those forming trusses in order to keep the membrane in tension. The lightweight membrane system used consists of four layers: waterproof fiberglass on the outside, insulation, a vapor barrier, then an acoustic insulation layer. This is semitransparent enough to fulfill most daytime lighting needs beneath the dome. The first large span examples were two Seoul, South Korea, sports arenas built in 1986 for the Olympics, one 93 meters wide and the other 120 meters wide. The Georgia Dome, built in 1992 on an oval plan, uses instead a triangulated pattern in a system patented as the \\"Tenstar Dome\\". The Millennium Dome was completed as the largest cable dome in the world with a diameter of 320 meters and uses a different system of membrane support, with cables extending down from the 12 masts that penetrate the membrane. The first cable dome to use rigid steel frame panels as roofing instead of a translucent membrane was begun for an athletic center in North Carolina in 1994. = Retractable domes and stadiums = ≈åita Stadium in Japan. The higher expense of rigid large span domes made them relatively rare, although rigidly moving panels is the most popular system for sports stadiums with retractable roofing. With a span of 126 meters, Pittsburgh's Civic Arena featured the largest retractable dome in the world when completed for the city's Civic Light Opera in 1961. Six of its eight sections could rotate behind the other two within three minutes, and in 1967 it became the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team. The first domed baseball stadium, the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, was completed in 1965 with a rigid 641 foot wide steel dome filled with 4,596 skylights. Other early examples of rigid stadium domes include the steel frame Superdome of New Orleans and the cement Kingdome of Seattle. The Louisiana Superdome has a span of 207 meters. Stockholm's 1989 Ericsson Globe, an arena for ice hockey, earned the title of largest hemispherical building in the world with a diameter of 110 meters and height of 85 meters. Montreal's Olympic Stadium featured a retractable membrane roof in 1988, although repeated tearing led to its replacement with a non-retractable roof. The SkyDome of Toronto opened in 1989 with a rigid system in four parts: one that is fixed, two that slide horizontally, and one that rotates along the edge of the 213 meter wide span. In Japan, the 1993 Fukuoka Dome featured a 222-meter dome in three parts, two of which rotated under the third. ≈åita Stadium was built in 2001 as a mostly fixed semi- spherical roof 274 meters wide with two large membrane-covered panels that can slide down from the center to opposite sides.  Twenty-first century  The variety of modern domes over sports stadiums, exhibition halls, and auditoriums have been enabled by developments in materials such as steel, reinforced concrete and plastics.

Starring Sandler, Terry Crews, Jorge Garcia, Taylor Lautner, Rob Schneider and Luke Wilson, the plot follows six men who discover that they share the same bank-robbing father (Nick Nolte), and thereafter set out to reunite with him. Released worldwide on Netflix on December 11, 2015, the film was panned by critics and is one of the few films to receive an approval rating of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Plot In the Old West, Tommy (Adam Sandler), known as \\"White Knife\\" by the Native American tribe who raised him after his mother was murdered, is to marry a member of the tribe named Smoking Fox (Julia Jones). Following a run-in with Will Patch (Will Forte) and his Left-Eye Gang, who have all removed their right eye, as well as a one-eyed food proprietor named Clem (Steve Zahn), Tommy is visited by a bank robber named Frank Stockburn (Nick Nolte) who claims to be his biological father. Frank tells Tommy that he is dying of consumption and had amassed $50,000 buried in a meadow, which he offers to Tommy and his tribe. The next day, a group of bandits led by the ruthless Cicero (Danny Trejo) come to the village and want Frank to give them his \\"big score.‚Äù Frank has the bandits kidnap him so he can lead them to the money at the so-called \\"Singing Windmill\\", in return for the bandits not attacking Tommy or the Natives. After searching the meadow Tommy is unable to find the stash of money and sets off on a quest to steal the amount needed and save his father. During his journey, Tommy discovers that he has 5 half-brothers: Mexican burro rider Ramon (Rob Schneider) whose innkeeper mother had a fling with Frank; mentally challenged yet happy-go-lucky Lil' Pete (Taylor Lautner) whose strong neck makes him immune to hanging; feral mountain-man Herm (Jorge Garcia) who speaks incomprehensibly and helped his mother sell their moonshine; Drunkard, Danny (Luke Wilson), Abraham Lincoln's former bodyguard who is guilt-ridden from accidentally leading John Wilkes Booth to murder the president; and African-American saloon pianist Chico (Terry Crews) who confesses to being half-White. Meanwhile, having joined the Left-Eye Gang at the cost of his only functional eye, Clem helps the bandits abduct Smoking Fox. She escapes due to Clem's inability to see and begins searching for Tommy and his brothers, now known as the Ridiculous 6. After meeting Chico and Danny, the brothers have a run in with Chico's boss, sociopathic saloon owner, Smiley Harris (Harvey Keitel), who was part of Frank's gang until Frank stole his cut of their biggest score and left him to die at the windmill. When Smiley attempts to kill the brothers out of revenge against Frank, he ends up being unintentionally decapitated by Ramon. The Left-Eye Gang soon catch up to the Ridiculous 6 while the latter are relaxing in a pond. The gang overpowers the brothers and steals their loot. Through Herm's ramblings, translated by Tommy, the brothers then decide to rob a gambling game in Yuma hosted by Ezekiel Grant (Jon Lovitz) and attended by Mark Twain (Vanilla Ice) and General George Armstrong Custer (David Spade). The brother's succeed, though Wyatt Earp (Blake Shelton) nearly jeopardizes their plan, and set off to ransom their father. On the way, the 6 come across the Left-Eye Gang who have been left to die in the desert by Cicero. Tommy and the brothers rescue Will and his gang and reclaim the $50,000 they had stolen from them. That evening, Tommy sees a photograph carried by Danny that proves Cicero is the one who murdered his mother and sets off alone to rescue his father and confront the bandit leader. After meeting with Cicero and paying the ransom, Tommy confronts Cicero just and gets his revenge on his mother's killer. The half- brothers, who followed Tommy along with the Left-Eye Gang, have a reunion with their long lost father. When Frank learns his sons exceeded his expectations by amassing $100,000 he reveals that he masterminded his abduction. But Tommy counters that his group had a Plan B: a hidden bomb inside the bag containing the ransom money. When the bomb explodes and commotion ensues, Frank runs off to a mine with Smoking Fox as his hostage. Tommy runs after them and successfully rescues his bride-to-be and captures his father. Back in the Native Village, Tommy weds Smoking Fox with his brothers in attendance. Since the revelation that their biological father Frank Stockburn was no more than a two-bit crook, the Native chief decides to adopt all the half-brothers as he did with Tommy, while the Left-Eye Gang reveals that they lied about removing their right eyes, much to the anger of Clem. CastProduction The Ridiculous 6 had been in production by Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros., but was dropped by all three. The latter dropped out soon after Adam Sandler and Happy Madison Productions signed a four-picture deal with Netflix, although an insider noted to The Hollywood Reporter that the deal had nothing to do with their decision. By January 2015, Netflix picked up the film with others joining the cast including Taylor Lautner, Nick Nolte, Blake Shelton, Steve Buscemi, Rob Schneider, Will Forte, Vanilla Ice and Luke Wilson. On February 16, 2015, Jorge Garcia joined the cast. Principal photography began on February 20, 2015, and ended on May 2, 2015. =Controversy= On April 23, 2015, Indian Country Today Media Network reported that approximately \\"a dozen Native actors and actresses, as well as the Native cultural advisor, left the set of Adam Sandler‚Äôs newest film production, The Ridiculous Six\\" in protest of its portrayal of the Apache culture. The New York Daily News later reported that there were only four who left, out of over 100 Native American actors on the set. Navajo Nation tribal members Loren Anthony and film student Allison Young said they left because they felt the film portrayed Native Americans in a negative light and took satire too far. They also complained that the portrayal of women was degrading. A representative of Netflix responded saying, \\"The movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason: because it is ridiculous. It is a broad satire of Western movies and the stereotypes they popularized, featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of‚Äîbut in on‚Äîthe joke.\\" On May 4, 2015, the New York Daily News reported that Ricky Lee, one of the Native American actors on the Ridiculous 6 set, said previous news reports were exaggerated and indeed there were only \\"four actors who left, but there were 150 extras, including grandmas and grandpas and children, who kept working.\\" Apparently, before the film's wrap party, he and several other actors were approached by Sandler to speak about the controversy. Lee considered that those who left raised legitimate issues but it was \\"the wrong battlefield.\\" Release The film premiered on Netflix on December 11, 2015. On January 6, 2016, Netflix announced that the film had been viewed more times in 30 days than any other film in Netflix history. It also made it to the #1 spot in every territory in which Netflix operates. =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, with 36 reviews, the film has a rare approval rating of 0%meaning no favorable reviews whatsoeverreceiving an average rating of 2.29/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Every bit as lazily offensive as its cast and concept would suggest, The Ridiculous Six is standard couch fare for Adam Sandler fanatics and must-avoid viewing for film enthusiasts of every other persuasion.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 18 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\".

The vulnerability dated back to 2000 and affected all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1. The vulnerability allows hackers to remotely take control of Windows devices that connect to an Active Directory domain. JASBUG is registered in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system as . The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, part of the Department of Homeland Security, issued ICS-ALERT-15-041-01, warning control systems owners that they should expedite applying critical JASBUG fixes. Microsoft released two patches, MS15-011 and MS15-014, to address JASBUG on the same day the vulnerability was disclosed. These fixes took Microsoft over a year to develop and deploy due to the complexity of the JASBUG vulnerability. At the time of disclosure, more than 300 million computers were believed to be vulnerable to the exploit.  History  JASBUG was disclosed to the public by Microsoft as a part of \\"Patch Tuesday,\\" on February 10th, 2015. = Background = The vulnerability was initially reported to Microsoft in January 2014 by Jeff Schmidt, founder of JAS Global Advisors. After Microsoft publicly announced the security vulnerability, it garnered the name JASBUG in reference to the role JAS Global Advisors played in discovering the exploit. = Discovery = In 2014, JAS Global Advisors was working on an engagement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the organization governing the standards of the Internet, to research potential technical issues surrounding the rollout of new Generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) on the Internet. While working on the research, JAS Global Advisors, with business partner SimMachines, uncovered the vulnerability by applying \\"big data\\" analytical techniques to very large technical data sets.  Effect  JASBUG principally affects business and government users. Home users are less likely to be affected by JASBUG because they do not use domain- configured computers. White House cybersecurity advisor Michael Daniel spoke about the importance of addressing JASBUG in a meeting of the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board of the National Institute for Standards and Technology, and the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Homeland Security immediately took steps to fix the vulnerability on federal networks. Suzanne E. Spaulding, serving as Under Secretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) at the Department of Homeland Security, mentioned JASBUG in a February 2015 House of Representatives hearing that touched on the potential effect of a DHS funding hiatus. In the aftermath of JASBUG, various government agencies have updated their technical specifications to mitigate exploit risks. For example, the United States Department of Veteran Affairs decided in May 2015 to \\"unapprove\\" the use of Windows Server 2003 based on JASBUG risks. = Exploitation = According to Microsoft, the exploit takes advantage of how Group Policy receives and applies policy data when a domain-joined system connects to a domain controller. One likely exploitation of the flaw involves deceiving a user with a domain-configured system into a network controlled by a hacker. Despite the potential effect, there is no indication that the JASBUG vulnerability was ever used by cyberhackers to access corporate or government computers. = Specific systems affected = JASBUG affects Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT, and Windows RT 8.1. Windows Server 2003 is also affected, but there will not be a JASBUG patch this platform, as Microsoft has indicated that it is not feasible to build a fix for this version. JASBUG also affects Windows XP and Windows 2000, but no patch will be made available for these operating systems as they are no longer supported by Microsoft.  Bugfix and deployment  Unlike other high-profile vulnerabilities like Heartbleed, Shellshock, Gotofail and POODLE, JASBUG was a design problem, not an implementation problem, making this type of vulnerability unusual and much more difficult to fix. The fix required Microsoft to re-engineer core components of the operating system and to add several new features, including additional hardening of Group Policy, the feature that organizations use to centrally manage Windows systems, applications, and user settings in Active Directory environments. Microsoft was not able to fix the JASBUG flaw on Windows Server 2003 systems, noting that \\"The architecture to properly support the fix provided in the update does not exist on Windows Server 2003 systems, making it infeasible to build the fix for Windows Server 2003.\\" For unpatched and unpatchable platforms that may be vulnerable to JASBUG, security firms like Symantec recommend that organizations use intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to monitor network activity for possible malicious JASBUG traffic.

Brazil brought its case to the World Trade Organization, and South Africa chose to impose a general tariff on chicken imports, rather than anti-dumping duties against Brazilian importers. Chicken  Origins of the dispute  In June 2011, the Southern African Poultry Association (SAPA) filed a complaint with the International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC) of South Africa about the alleged dumping of Brazilian frozen chicken products in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) countries, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa. ITAC launched its investigation in June 2011. After examining the relevant data in the South African market between 2008 and 2010, the ITAC imposed provisional anti- dumping duties of between 6% and 63% in January 2012, following an investigation that concluded that three major Brazilian exporters sold chicken products at prices below their domestic market cost. The ITAC concluded that SACU chicken suffered material injury due to price undercutting, lower profit margins, reduced market share, lower revenue growth and under-utilization of production capacity. The Commission's report estimates the dumping margin for whole frozen chickens at 63 percent and 47 percent for boneless cuts. The Brazilian Poultry Association (UBABEF) argued that the duties were put in place to protect the inefficient South African poultry industry, and that higher costs would be passed onto consumers, approximately US$70 million per year. Brazil made informal attempts to resolve the dispute, such as by proposing a trade-off between Brazilian chicken and South African wine, which the South Africans rejected.  Case Brought Before WTO  On 21 June 2012, Brazil requested consultations with South Africa in the WTO regarding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on Brazilian chicken, formally beginning the WTO's dispute resolution process. Brazil argued that South Africa acted on incomplete information, and that their initiation and conduct of the investigation were inconsistent with South Africa's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Anti-Dumping Agreement. In particular, Brazil took issue with the determination of injury, South Africa's definition of domestic industry, the evidence used and the process of investigation, asserting that ITAC failed to produce positive evidence for injury and questioned the methodology of the investigation as flawed. Brazil said the South African Poultry Association had \\"grossly overstated\\" statistics on chicken imports and cited SA's \\"uncooperativeness\\" and \\"unreasonable attitude\\" as reasons to raise the dispute with the WTO.  Resolution  After negotiation with the Brazilian government, South African trade and industry minister Rob Davies declined to implement the ITAC recommendations. He acknowledged the stiff competition that South African producers faced from Brazil, but said that there was need for a more ‚Äúcomprehensive strategy‚Äù that dealt with all poultry exporters to South Africa, to the dismay of the SAPA. Instead of definitive anti-dumping duties, South Africa chose to impose import tariffs of up to 82% (up from 27%) on all poultry products originating from countries from which South Africa has no preferential trade arrangements, on the basis that the domestic industry was affected by all chicken imports, not only those from Brazil. Davies acknowledged the need to protect South African producers, but said that the antidumping duties had failed to have the desired effect, and that a general tariff increase would likely be more effective.  Reaction and Aftermath  The South African Poultry Association was dissatisfied with this result, taking the position that to be effective, a general tariff would have to be imposed on all frozen chicken imports. However, this is not possible because of the EU-South African Trade and Development Cooperation Agreement, which states that no tariffs may be applied by South Africa to goods originating from the EU. Between January 2012 and May 2013, SAPA reported 5,000 job losses and the closure of five small-to-medium poultry farms, citing increased foreign competition. SAPA estimated that ZAR 3.5 billion (US$390 million) worth of \\"unrealistically priced\\" chicken entered the South African market in 2012 alone, equivalent to approximately 5 million chickens per week, and that 20,000 jobs would be created if these chickens were produced domestically. The South African Food and Allied Workers‚Äô Union (FAWU) supported SAPA's calls for increased government intervention. In April 2013, protestors marched to Parliament to hand a memorandum to the Department of Trade of Industry to place stricter import tariffs on poultry imports from Brazil in order to protect 40,000 jobs in the sector. Association of Meat Importers and Exporters CEO David Wolpert said that the removal of import duties would be beneficial to the South African consumers, as it would keep prices at ‚Äúreasonable levels‚Äù.

Designed by Joseph Herenden Clark of McKim, Mead & White and built in 1913, the structure originally housed a variety of different student organizations and school functions. In 1973, it was converted into a campuswide dining hall; it underwent a second renovation in 2003 that returned multipurpose student functionalities to its upper floors. History The Students' Building James Monroe Taylor, fourth president of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York, wrote in 1901 of a dearth of a dedicated social space on campus \\"not devoted to college work but to college recreation.\\" He envisioned a building akin to Harvard's University Club and the University of Pennsylvania's Houston Club; with a swelling student body size and rapid decentralization of the campus over the course of the first decade of the 1900s, the need for such a structure become even more crucial. The Students' Building was erected in 1913 after its cornerstone was laid on September 25, 1912. Funding for its construction came from an anonymous donor who sought to provide for the \\"exclusive needs and interests of student organizations\\" with the gift and who specified the name Students' Building for the structure. Mary Babbott Ladd of the Vassar class of 1908 was later identified as that donor. Until World War II, dining at Vassar was an elegant affair with table linens and serving maids, but after the war was over, these features were never brought back to student life. In 1973, the All Campus Dining Center, also called the ACDC or the Deece, opened within the building, serving as a replacement to individual dining rooms in each of the college's dormitories. The old system had proved too costly and overcrowded, necessitating the ACDC's creation. The $3.5 million renovation was conducted by Walker O. Cain and Associates, with over $1 million of the funds coming from friends and family of Babbott Ladd. An $11 million renovation in 2003 was designed by Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc. Another project, to renovate the kitchen of the Dining Center and adjust the locations of the building's bathrooms began in 2016. The changes, undertaken by LTL Architects, totaled $8‚Äì9 million and concluded with an open plan renovation, the refurbishment of some of the center's original features, and an increase in buildingwide capacity to over 1,000 occupants. Work began in earnest on the dining center mid-2017 and concluded at the beginning of the following academic year, opening August 25, 2017. The All Campus Dining Center was renamed Gordon Commons the following year, in gratitude for gifts to support the renovations made by Ellen Rubin Gordon, chair and CEO of Tootsie Roll Industries, who was a member of Vassar's class of 1952. Architecture and uses The Students' Building was designed by the New York City architecture firm of McKim, Mead & White, representing their only project at Vassar College. The plans were drawn up by young architect Joseph Herenden Clark, a recent graduate of the Columbia School of Architecture who, upon hearing the requirement that the structure be made from brick with white trim and a slate roof, recalled Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia. Clark had studied Christ Church, which George Washington attended, during his days at Columbia. He trekked to Alexandria to study the interior and exterior of the church and ultimately the designs for the Students' Building, his first public plan, were inspired by its architecture and features. Bishop and Company were contracted to construct the Students' Building, an example of the Southern colonial revival style. It sits on the north edge of campus due south of the college's North Gate and southeast of residential quad dorms like Lathrop House. Noyes House was built in 1958 and rests immediately to the southeast of the Students' Building. The west dining wing of the Students' Building before 2017 renovations When the Students' Building opened, it stood two stories tall with a basement, as well as wooden pillars on its facade supporting a pediment. A cupola topped the structure and stairs beneath the pediment led to a three sets of double doors‚Äîone large, the others smaller but otherwise identical. Above each set of doors was a single large window. In the 1973 renovation, two red brick wings were added to the east and west sides of the building to accommodate numerous dining rooms. Featuring large windows, the new wings were more modern in their style than the old central portion of the building. The UpC Cafe on the building's third floor, closed in 2015 The first floor of the building was built as a grand 1,200-seat auditorium with a proscenium stage, and meeting rooms dedicated to student organizations. The second floor consisted of a U-shaped balcony and the Old Council Room, a gathering space for smaller organizations. The Old Council Room was repainted in 1945 as part of a minor renovation of the building that also included the opening of a student eatery called The Hoot on the west side. The ceiling was made from decorated plaster and dentils evoked the exterior neoclassical architectural style. The basement housed several offices and later a bicycle exchange, used bookshop, and student storage space. After the 1973 renovation, dishwashing equipment for the ACDC was housed upstairs, along with staff offices. The 2003 renovation saw the removal of this dishwashing equipment; instead, the second upstairs was repurposed as a multifunctional student space, in line with the original intentions for the building. The second story‚Äîcalled UpC‚Äîis now an open space capable of seating 600 people when chairs are added; it also features multimedia equipment and a third-floor mezzanine that, until 2015, housed the UpC Cafe. Historically, the structure was used by and for student organizations. Formerly housed in the Calisthenium and Riding Academy and later the Alumnae Gymnasium, the Philaletheis Society moved into the Students' Building upon its opening and began to use the space for its theatrical performances. The junior prom, lectures from a wide array of speakers, and faculty-led skits all took place beneath the building's roof. Vassar's yearbook, the Vassarion, as well as its weekly newspaper, The Miscellany News, were also headquartered in the Students' Building. An annual Christmas party, complete with students clad as reindeer pulling a sled on which sat political science professor Charles Gordon Post dressed as Santa Claus, once occurred within the building as well.

First published in 1980 and re-released in 2011, it has become an \\"Australian cult classic\\" and a \\"publishing phenomenon\\". Between its launch in 1980 and its relaunch in 2011, the book sold more than a million copies, despite having been out of print for a significant portion of that period. During the 1970s and 80s, The Australian Women's Weekly was among the highest-selling magazines in Australia and published a wide range of titles for cake decorating, recipe and meal ideas in both book and magazine form. Themes and designs Child blowing out candle on the brown bear cake (1986) There are 108 themed cakes appearing in the original edition, \\"largely composed of packet butter cake mix, Vienna cream icing and lollies\\", although \\"for the over-achiever\\", the book offers a recipe for fresh butter cake at the front. The cover illustration is of the \\"train cake\\", for which it became synonymous ‚Äî the cookbook is sometimes referred to as \\"the book with the train on the cover\\". The swimming pool cake ‚Äî a construction filled with jelly and tiny swimming figures ‚Äî has been referred to as \\"the crowning glory\\" because to a parent, it seemed so difficult to engineer. Some of the better-known cakes are: * Choo-choo train (cover image), featuring popcorn * Swimming pool, featuring green jelly, typically Aeroplane Jelly * Jack in the box * Piano * Castle, featuring meringue * Clock * Racetrack, figure-8 shape * Robot * Lion * Good witch * Farmyard * Miss Muffet * Cricket bat * Cricket field * Dolly Varden * Miss Piggy * Humpty dumpty * Duck, featuring chips * Pirate * Rubber ducky * Shark * Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe * Echidna * Koala * Giraffe * Ghost * Gingerbread house * Hopscotch * Pink elephant * Typewriter * Butterfly Publication history left Some of the cakes featured in a Children's Party Foods -themed lift-out in September 1974. This included a Cowboys and Indians cake which looked very similar to the later Farmyard, and the Hickory Dickory Clock, later named Clock. Clark was inspired to create the cookbook after creating a tyrannosaurus-cake for a neighbour in 1978, but despite this inspiration, no dinosaur-themes cakes were included in the eventual publication. The first edition was printed in 1980, and a \\"vintage\\" edition of the book was published in 2011 ‚Äî being reprinted four times in the first six months with initial sales of 100,000 copies. As of 2015, the 2011 edition is in the circulating collection of over 40 public libraries across the country while the original edition (in various reprints) remains in circulation in 27. Four of the original recipes featuring cartoon characters were removed from the 2011 edition due to the publisher no longer having a license. First editions can sell on eBay for 12 times their original price. Influence Recreation of the \\"rubber ducky\\" cake Australian demographer Bernard Salt has suggested that the book modernised and \\"grandified\\" children's birthday party culture in Australia. The author, Pamela Clark, has said that children would take the book to bed with them as bedtime reading, choosing which cake their parents would make for them, and the publisher's test kitchen had a dedicated, much-used telephone help-line for parents making the cakes to a deadline. Because of the appealing decorative effects of the cakes, the book has garnered a nostalgic cult following including social media fan groups and projects to reproduce each cake. In 2009, stand-up comedian Josh Earl included reference to the \\"train cake\\" in his routine. The segment was so popular he expanded it and the following year launched Josh Earl vs. the Australian Women's Weekly Children's Birthday Cake Book, a show that continued through to 2015. In 2016 all 107 cakes were baked and sold for a Canberra charity to raise money to support women with post- and ante-natal depression. In 2018 New Zealand born photographer Henry Hargreaves created an exhibition in Wellington called \\"Birthdays that will never come\\" celebrating children who would never have birthdays in New Zealand, by combining children's names that are banned in New Zealand with the \\"very 80s aesthetic\\" of the cakes in the cookbook, familiar to him from childhood. In a September 2018 interview on Throwback: Our Childhoods Revisited series, co-author Pamela Clark noted the heirloom quality of the cookbook, with old copies being passed down in families for generations of cake-making. In 2020, the book turned 40 and Clark noted that its 106 recipes have been birthday party staples ever since its first publication. Despite the elaborate cakes featured on the internet, ‚Äúyou get these ‚Ä¶ daggy cakes ... and they‚Äôre more popular than all of the upmarket ones.‚Äù In the first half of 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, sales of the book increased by about 30%. The change was attributed to people being more at home as well as to nostalgia in difficult times.

Initially her husband neither opposed nor supported her shooting sports, who now proudly encourages her along with the whole family. Tomar has five children and twelve grandchildren. She began learning to shoot by chance, when her granddaughter Shefali wanted to learn how to shoot at Johri Rifle Club. Her granddaughter was shy to go alone to an all-boys shooting club. and wanted her grandmother to accompany her. At the range, Tomar took a pistol when her granddaughter could not load it and she started shooting at a target. Her first shot resulted in bull's eye hit. The club coach, Farooq Pathan, was surprised to see her shoot so skillfully. He suggested she join the club and get trained to become a shooter, which Tomar did. Her trainer commented: \\"She has the ultimate skill, a steady hand and a sharp eye.\\" She attends the club once a week for shooting practice and otherwise attends to her household chores of cooking, cleaning, tending to cattle and feeding her large family. After dinner is served, she takes up shooting practice at her private range. Shooting runs in the family as noted from the fact that her niece Seema Tomar, also a sharp shooter, was the first Indian woman to win a medal at the Rifle and Pistol World Cup in 2010. Her grand daughter, Shefali Tomar, achieved international shooter status and has taken part in international competitions in Hungary and Germany; both of them credit Tomar for the positive encouragement provided and praised her sister Prakashi Tomar for advising them. Since 1999, Tomar has competed in and won 25 national championships throughout India. She won a gold medal at the Veteran Shooting Championship conducted in Chennai.

O'Brien (born August 20, 1939, New Orleans, Louisiana) is a research scientist, medical educator and a leading expert in the science and treatment of addiction. He is board certified in neurology, psychiatry and addiction psychiatry. He is currently the Kenneth E. Appel Professor of Psychiatry, and Vice Chair of Psychiatry, in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Career O‚ÄôBrien earned MD and PhD degrees from Tulane University in 1964 and 1966, respectively, and received residency training in internal medicine, neurology and psychiatry at Harvard University, Tulane, the University of London, and the University of Pennsylvania. While serving as Chief of Psychiatry at the Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Center in Philadelphia, O‚ÄôBrien in 1971 founded and became director of a clinical research program consisting of a group of VA and University of Pennsylvania scientists. From 1971 until 2013, he served as director of this research center, called the Center for Studies of Addiction at the University of Pennsylvania. He and the center's other researchers made many discoveries about the treatment of addictive disorders, and published their research findings in more than 500 research papers, all authored or co- authored by O'Brien, and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. O'Brien and his colleagues at the Center for Studies of Addiction received personal praise, for their innovative research and results in helping patients recover from drug addiction, from U.S. President George H.W. Bush during a September 1991 tour of the center. In addition to conducting scientific research, O‚ÄôBrien also has advised U.S. government authorities on policies affecting the availability of drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, as well as on government's proper role in preventing and treating addictive disorders. He has also provided policy advice about drugs and addiction to many other countries, especially France. In the US, O'Brien has chaired or served as a member of many Institute of Medicine committees dealing with science and drug abuse policy matters. From 2007 to 2013, he served as chairperson of the Substance Use Disorders Committee of the American Psychiatric Association. The purpose of this committee was to revise the primary classification system, known as DSM-5, that psychiatrists use in diagnosing mental illnesses, including addiction disorders. There was no validated measure of addiction in the 1970s, so O‚ÄôBrien began work, together with A. Thomas McLellan, PhD, to develop the \\"Addiction Severity Index,\\" a tool that was later translated into over 30 languages and which by 2012 was being used throughout the world to determine the extent of patients' problems and tailor appropriate treatment approaches. Naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, was already in use by the early 1980s as a medication for treating addiction to heroin and other opioids, but not alcohol addiction. Based on animal studies, O‚ÄôBrien in the 1980s theorized that alcohol produced pleasure by releasing endorphins ‚Äì the brain's naturally occurring opioids. Accordingly, blocking endorphin receptors might help alcoholics resist drinking. In 1983, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted permission to test this theory on patients. With funding provided by the U.S. Veterans Administration Substance Abuse Center in Philadelphia, O‚ÄôBrien and one of his students, fellow University of Pennsylvania psychiatrist Joseph Volpicelli, and others conducted a study in which all addiction patients received counseling, but half of them also received Naltrexone, while the other half received a placebo. During three months of treatment, those receiving Naltrexone had fewer relapses to heavy drinking and reported less craving and less pleasure when they did drink. Working from these observations, O‚ÄôBrien and his colleagues discovered a new treatment for alcoholism using Naltrexone.Archives of General Psychiatry, 1992 In 1995, the FDA approved Naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence, ushering in a new era of alcoholism treatment which, prior to this time, had been limited mainly to psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions such as Alcoholics Anonymous. In later studies, O‚ÄôBrien and his colleagues noticed that Naltrexone seemed to work effectively on only a subset of alcohol- addicted patients. The researchers began investigating why some alcoholics respond well to Naltrexone while others do not. Their work led to the discovery of genes that determine the extent of pleasure one feels when drinking alcohol.Neuropsychopharmacology, 2003 Individuals with a particular genetic variant have a sensitive endogenous opioid system that is activated by alcohol, thereby producing stimulation and euphoria. Naltrexone blocks this form of alcohol reward, so the medication is particularly effective for these individuals.Archives of General Psychiatry, 2008 Aimed at establishing a genomic sub-category of alcoholism, this work seemed to support the movement toward \\"personalized medicine\\" in the treatment of alcoholism. O'Brien and his colleagues never applied for a patent on the discovery of Naltrexone's effectiveness for treating alcohol addiction, so this treatment continues to be used at no cost worldwide. He has served as president of both the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology and the Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Disease.

Anagrapheus; 12 January 1801 ‚Äì 1 April 1896) was a Dutch writer. Born in Leiden in 1801, Bluss√© was the daughter of Abraham Bluss√© and Jeanne Petronella Maizonnet. Her father was an editor and school inspector, and a proponent of the Walloon church. Bluss√© married the historian and archaeologist Caspar Reuvens in Leiden on 19 July 1822. They had three children. After the death of Reuvens in 1835, Bluss√© lived with her parents' family in Leiden, and they collaborated on the creation of a pocket dictionary in two volumes, English-Dutch and Dutch-English, which were published in the years 1843 and 1845 respectively. Around 1860, Bluss√© met Maria Leer (died 1866), who was living in a Leiden almshouse. Leer had been one of the founders of Zwijndrechtse nieuwlichters (Zwijndrecht New Lighters), a Dutch Protestant sect, which had established a commune within a boatbuilder's yard near Zwijndrecht earlier in the century. Bluss√© made notes of her conversations with Leer, and more than 25 years after Leer's death, Bluss√© decided to publish Leer's memoir. Using the pen name, D.N. Anagrapheus, Bluss√© published the work under the title \\"De Zwijndrechtsche nieuwlichters (1816-1832) volgens de gedenkschriften van Maria Leer\\", with a foreword by the Arminian preacher Jan Hendrik Maronier (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1892). At the time of publication, Bluss√© was 91 years old. In an 1892 article in De Gids, professor Hendrick Peter Godfried Quack (1834-1917) stated that, based on Bluss√©'s description, Zwijndrechtse nieuwlichters could be characterized as a form of religious communism. Bluss√© died in April 1896 at the age of 95 in her hometown of Leiden. The biologist and professor Hugo de Vries was a grandson of hers.

He was a Phigalian by birth and a son of Artylas, who had been adopted by Tritaeus, an influential citizen of Megalopolis. He was one of those tyrants who were set up at that time in various parts of Greece by the Macedonian king Antigonus II Gonatas. During his tyranny the territory of Megalopolis was invaded by the Spartans under Acrotatus. Pausanias says this was \\"Acrotatus I, the eldest son of king Cleomenes\\", but most probably it was Acrotatus II. The army of Megalopolis had the better of the encounter and Acrotatus was killed, which allows to date the battle to c. 262 BC.Pausanias, Description of Greece VIII 27,11.

It primarily serves as a highway interchange between State Road 826 (SR 826, Palmetto Expressway) and SR 836 (Dolphin Expressway), but also has ramps to surface streets such as SR 969 (Milam Dairy Road) and Flagler Street. The reconstruction project was completed in phases from 2012 to 2015-2016, at a cost of about $560 million, with related construction beginning in 2009, replacing the old two-level diamond interchange. The interchange was considered well beyond safe capacity, serving over 400,000 vehicles per day. The reconstruction was the final phase in a 12-step program to improve the highly trafficked Palmetto Expressway, though in 2014 a new project to add express lanes to the Palmetto Expressway was proposed, to begin construction in 2016. Much work also remains for the Dolphin Expressway. Work took place with phased detours, closures, and openings. All roads involved were kept open throughout construction. Much of the new interchange opened in October 2015, including the two highest flyovers, with completion at that point scheduled for March 2016. By summer 2016, the interchange was objectively complete. The official announcement came in early October, very near budget ($563 million) but a couple years over time. The project included moving a drainage canal and construction of 45 individual bridges, with the interchange serving 430,000 vehicles daily. The main four levels of the interchange are the Palmetto at ground level under the Dolphin Expressway, the Dolphin-to-Palmetto left-hand flyovers, then the Palmetto-to-Dolphin left-hand flyovers on top. As of 2016, it's the largest stack interchange in Miami (surpassing the Midtown Interchange).

Set during the Ice Age, it tells the story of a trainee shaman, from a tribe of European early modern humans, who must learn the skills to survive and to aid his people.  Synopsis  The novel begins with Loon, a boy from a tribe of Ice Age humans who call themselves the Wolf Pack, being stripped naked and sent into a lonely valley where he is expected to try to survive alone for two weeks as a test of manhood. Despite a rainstorm on the first day, Loon succeeds in using the skills he has been taught by Thorn, the Wolf Pack's shaman. He manages to start a fire, kill animals for food, and make himself clothing. During his trial he encounters a group of Neanderthals (a species of human whom his band calls 'the Old Ones') who attack him, and he injures a leg while escaping them, an injury that will trouble him for the rest of his story. Despite many adventures, Loon completes his trial and returns to the Wolf Pack. At this point it is revealed that he is just twelve years old. The next section of the novel describes Loon's life among the Wolf Pack, a small band of hunter- gatherers who migrate according to the seasons, hunting caribou in the winter, fish and deer in the summer. Loon's parents are both dead, and he is being raised by Thorn to be a shaman, teaching him about the spirit world and the stories of his people in addition to more practical survival skills. Thorn is a wise but crotchety master who flicks Loon's ears when he makes mistakes. He also teaches Loon to paint cave art in a sacred cave. Another prominent member of the Wolf Pack is Heather, a wise woman skilled in medicine. Every summer, the Wolf Pack attends a festival called the 'eight eight' where the various local bands meet to dance and share stories, and where the shamans corroborate their astronomical observations. At one such festival, Loon meets Elga, a young woman who wants to leave her own tribe and join another. She and Loon fall in love and, much to Thorn's displeasure, they marry and have a child. Loon continues to learn the way of the shaman, rejecting Thorn's belief that shamans must not marry. At the next year's festival, however, Elga is abducted by men from a northern tribe. Loon, helped by a traveller called Pippiloette, follows them, but after a few days Loon too is captured by the men while Pippiloette escapes. The men, who belong to a band called the Jende, take them far to the north, to the foot of the great ice cap on the shores of the Great Salt Sea. Despite living in the frozen north, the Jende live well, thanks to their use of captive slaves to do much of their work. Loon and Elga are kept separate, and Loon is forced to work with the Jende as they hunt through the winter. Meanwhile, Pippiloette returns to the Wolf Pack to explain what has happened. Thorn decides to follow the Jende's trail and rescue Loon and Elga. He enlists the help of Click, a strong and friendly Old One (Neanderthal) who has befriended the Wolf Pack after Heather gave him medical aid. Click cannot speak like a human, communicating only in broken phrases, whistles and clicks, and his mind is intelligent but not human, yet he and Thorn learn to understand each other. Thorn and Click travel hundreds of miles to the north and rescue Loon and Elga in a surprise attack on the Jende. The four then travel all the way back to their own land, facing many dangers, and with Loon's bad leg causing extreme difficulties. The last part of the journey is across snow and is extremely difficult. Near to home, Click dies, and Thorn reluctantly decides that they must eat his body to survive. Finally, they return home, to the delight of their Pack. Life returns to normal for Loon and Elga, but Thorn is troubled by the ghost of Click, who haunts him, apparently in anger at the way his body was treated. The three bury Click's bones, and Loon feels that Click's spirit is absorbed into his bad leg, but Thorn continues to see the ghost and remains troubled. The Wolf Pack decides not to attend the next eight-eight festival to avoid the Jende, but they plan to attend the following year. Knowing that the Jende will demand recompense for the attack on them, Thorn proposes that Loon offer them a set of the snowshoes that he has been testing and improving, which are made from strong barks unavailable to the northmen. Loon spends months experimenting with and refining his snowshoe design, and at the festival, when the Jende demand the return of Elga, she defiantly refuses, and the northmen accept the offered snowshoes with grudging admiration. As the months pass, Thorn begins to sicken. Still haunted by the ghost of Click, he dies advising Loon to pass on the knowledge he has learned to future generations. Later, Loon visits the cave alone, and paints animals that he has observed: fighting rhinos and four horses. His lamp goes out and he becomes lost in the dark for four days, but is rescued by Elga and others who take him back out in what he describes as a spiritual rebirth. Back in the camp, he dreams of Thorn's ghost, who vows to haunt him. The novel ends with Loon training his son to be a shaman, and flicking his ears when he misremembers things.  Setting  Paintings of horses and of fighting rhinos, from the Chauvet Cave in France. In the novel, the character of Loon is the artist who creates these images. The text of the novel does not explicitly identify its geographical or temporal setting because it is told from the point of view of characters who lack our modern understanding of the world. However, Robinson has stated that the setting is 32,000 years ago in what is now southern France, and that the cave where Thorn and Loon paint is the Chauvet Cave, a recently rediscovered site of impressive cave art. In the novel's final chapter, Loon paints the fighting rhinoceroses and the four horse heads that can be seen on the walls of the real-life cave.

Plot The Boxcar Children tells the story of four orphaned children: Henry, Jessie (or Jess), Violet, and Benny, who have evidently been orphaned for some time. They come to a bakery to buy some bread, and ask to stay the night. When a baker and his wife learn that the children are orphans, baker and his wife plan to take in the three elder children, who are big enough to be useful in the bakery, but to send little Benny to a Children's Home. The children overhear the couple talking about this, and escape from the bakery. The bakers decide to chase them but then leave the children to go on their own. Finding an abandoned boxcar, the children start a new life of independence. Henry ends up working various odd jobs in a nearby town Silver City for a doctor, named Dr. Moore, in order to earn money for food and other materials they need. He also does gardening for the doctor's mother. The children's lives are pleasant and full of hard work until Violet becomes ill and they go to the doctor for assistance. Unbeknownst to the children, by that time the doctor knows very well who they are and where they are living; indeed, he has been keeping a discreet eye on them for weeks. Their grandfather, who lives nearby, has been advertising in the papers, offering a reward for news of them, but the doctor hasn't wanted to spoil the children's fun by informing on them. When Violet becomes ill, however, he feels it is time to do so. Their grandfather, a steel baron, named James Henry Alden, comes at once to see them. The doctor suggests that he gets to know them first before telling them who he is, so he is simply introduced to them as a friend of the doctor's. The children warm to his kindness and are surprised but delighted when they eventually learn that he is their much feared grandfather (but the children had been brought up to fear their grandfather, whom they had never met, because he did not approve of their parents' marriage). They go to live with him after all, and he has the boxcar transferred to his backyard for their enjoyment.

One of the fastest-moving stars in the galaxy, the star was first surveyed in 1982.  Discovery  US 708 was first discovered in 1982 by Peter Usher and colleagues of Pennsylvania State University as a faint blue object in the Milky Way halo. Sloan Digital Sky Survey measured the star again in 2005.  Research  In 2015, Stephan Geier of the European Southern Observatory led a team that reported in Science that the velocity of the star was , the highest ever recorded in the galaxy. The star's high velocity was originally suspected to be caused by the massive black hole at the center of the galaxy. But now it is found out that the star must have crossed the galactic disk about 14 million years ago and thus it did not come from the center of the galaxy; hence the speed now possessed by the star may not be attributed to the black hole. However, closer study suggested it had been one element of a pair of close binary stars. Its companion had already entered its white dwarf stage when US 708 entered its red giant phase. Their respective orbits changed as its companion took gas from the outer layers of US 708. Then its companion acquired enough mass to go supernova, which triggered US 708 being flung away at its high velocity, not by the black hole at the center of our galaxy. The team behind the new observations suggests that it was orbiting a white dwarf roughly the mass of the Sun with an orbital period of less than 10 minutes.  Structure  The star is a high speed rotating, dense helium star which is supposed to be formed by the interaction of a companion star nearby. These stars are composed of helium, which is the remnant of a massive star which had lost its envelope of hydrogen. Geier's team describe the star as the \\"fastest unbound star in the galaxy\\" and employed the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager attached to the 10 meter Keck II telescope in Hawaii. Its velocity exceeds the escape velocity of our galaxy.

Early history The ship was ordered from Naval Construction & Armament, Barrow, and laid down on 17 September 1891. She was launched on 17 December 1892 and commissioned on 25 April 1893. Niger was the training ship for and tender to . In 1902 she had a major refit at the Palmers Shipbuilding Company, where she was fitted with new and larger engines, and with Reed water tube boilers. On her completion she relieved as tender to Vernon. Sinking of HMS Niger On the morning of 11 November a U-boat attack occurred off Deal. Around noon there was an explosion and black smoke rose from HMS Niger. Niger was at anchor about off the pier at Deal when she was torpedoed and sunk before noon on 11 November 1914 by the German submarine . Niger was the first ship sunk by U-boat commander Walther Forstmann. Forstmann was one of the most successful commanders of the Imperial German Navy in the First World War. She was also the first Allied ship to be sunk by German submarines based at the newly captured Belgian naval bases. Many who were tracking the fighting from onshore saw the explosion and the smoke. Even though there were high winds and huge waves, boats went to the sinking ship and were able to take the crew off. Some of Nigers sailors were eating lunch when the torpedo hit and so were only lightly dressed. All officers, but only 77 men of Nigers crew survived the sinking, four people were injured. Lieutenant-Commander Arthur Thomas Muir, who commanded the ship remained on the bridge until the rest of the crew had left. He suffered serious injuries in the explosion. The injured were taken to the nearby Royal Naval Hospital. When HMS Niger was attacked there were about 100 other ships nearby. One of these had a Dutch flag and was moored very close to Niger and then suspiciously disappeared after the attack. The British Admiralty suspected it to be a German spy ship. The commander of the naval squadron, that HMS Niger was a member of, was Geoffrey Spicer-Simson who would later become famous for commanding a small flotilla which defeated a superior German force during the Battle for Lake Tanganyika. At the time of the sinking of Niger, Spicer-Simson was visiting his wife and some of her lady friends at a nearby hotel.

The sect was also known as the Christelijke Broedergemeente, \\"Apostolic Brethren Association\\", or the Zwavelstokkengeloof, \\"matchstick faith\\", and practiced what was later called \\"apostolic communism\\". The group held property in common and earned its keep by selling matchsticks and chocolate. Its appeal was broadly across the social classes, including day laborers, factory owners, and tradesmen. By the 1820s the group had established a community in Zwijndrecht, but could not outlive its founder by much; after the death of Muller the community split apart, with some members leaving for the United States and others forming their own congregations in the Netherlands. HistoryBeginnings= The sect was led by Stoffel Muller, a skipper from Puttershoek who came from a strict religious background who had had a religious experience that spawned a theology based on a \\"vague pantheism\\" which put a new spin on the idea of sin. Muller's partner was Maria Leer of Edam, a prophetess and domestic servant, 17 years his junior, whom he had met in Amsterdam and with whom he had formed a \\"spiritual marriage\\". The third of the three founders was the local schout (bailiff) from Waddinxveen, Dirk Valk, whose family was involved as well, as were a number of day laborers in the area. While Muller was considered the group's leader, he was not formally appointed as such. =Settlement= The group settled with Valk in Waddinxveen and formed a congregation, inspired by the Sermon on the Mount and modeled on the early Christian community. In 1818, the group moved to Polsbroekerdam, to the property of the farmer Dirk Schenkel. He offered them a place to stay, and in return they provided for themselves by making matches, which they sold door to door while propagating their faith. The match business provided nicknames for the group: nieuwlichters translates as \\"new-lighters\\", and zwavelstokkengeloof references those matches as well. Some historians argue that it was thanks to the group's hardworking nature that they received a measure of acceptance, despite their \\"communist features\\" and their despise for social convention. When the house they lived in Polsbroekerdam was sold, the group took to their ships and sailed around for a while, unable to find a homestead. In or around 1820, Muller, Valk, and Leer were sentenced to a year in jail in Dordrecht for vagrancy. Arie Goud and his wife, also members, were not sentenced; by 1822, when the three were released, the group had moved to Puttershoek and settled there; on 20 April 1823, the group legalized its community property relationship in Puttershoek. Valk and his wife, who had sold all their family possessions during the hard times of the late 1810s, left the group in 1822 to await Christ separately; Valk and his wife left shortly thereafter. In 1829, the remaining members bought a shipyard in Zwijndrecht and settled down for the last time, in the place that gave them their name. =Developments in the 1830s and dissolution= The 1830s saw the group prosper. They were joined by members who made important contributions to the settlement, including a wealthy baker from Krommenie and his wife, who started a bakery; a shoemaker from Middelburg and his family; and a former civil servant from the Dutch Indies. The most important new member, however, was Mets, a manufacturer of chocolate from Rotterdam, who came with his family and brought over his entire plant, workers and all, and the products were sold by the group's members. At this time there were two main sections to the settlement in Zwijndrecht. One, Welgelegen, consisted of a dance hall, which Muller had bought in Schellingwoude, taken apart, and moved to Zwijndrecht by ship. Meals were served in that hall; the members slept in a Keulenaar, a steam-powered ship that had been placed next to the dance hall. Men and women slept separately in two large rooms. Scripture was read during meals, and after dinner time was spent on religious study. The second area, Zomerzorg, was adjacent to the chocolate factory. Since the congregation did not accept civil government, they did not register the birth of their children (Maria Leer was arrested for not registering her daughter) and refused to do military service. The latter refusal became more urgent in the 1830s, starting with the Belgian Revolution, when men were called to arms to help suppress the uprising in what became Belgium. The congregation asked in vain to be exempt on religious grounds, and when the men were called up and refused to handle weapons, they were mistreated in the detention barracks and one man reportedly died. A professor from Leiden who was good friends with William II of the Netherlands, J. W. Tydeman, intervened on their behalf, assuring the king that he had nothing to fear from the group since their goals were only spiritual; as a result the members were given only non-combat duties while serving in the military. After the death of Muller in 1835, the group fell apart; harassed by local government which frequently put its leaders in jail, the group found it difficult to maintain its ideals and disbanded in 1846. Some thirty members left for the United States in 1863, attracted by the doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; they kept separate from the LDS, though they established a colony in Utah. Valk, who had moved to Woerdense Verlaat, a hamlet in the province of Utrecht described as the end of the world, subsequently moved to Mijdrecht where he again attracted a number of faithful from the old congregation. According to E. Cats Wor, for seven years a preacher in Mijdrecht, a group of some forty people, mostly artisans and laborers, from Puttershoek and Zwijndrecht lived communally in a ruined place out in the country. They did not share wives, but they did share everything else. They believed in God's unconditional love and did not accept damnation; they did not rest on Sunday since every day belonged to God; they used no tobacco. The members practiced charity and did not retaliate when attacked, nor did they accept military conscription. Two professors, Jodocus Heringa of Utrecht and De Hoop Scheffer, were unable to sway the group toward orthodoxy. By 1848, so many younger members of the group had left that the community was no longer viable and dissolved. Doctrine The sect's idea of the divinity was based on Paul's Epistle to the Romans, chapter 11 verse 36. They believed the meaning of this verse showed that sin derived from God; the sect's interpretation of it also excluded a belief in predestination. They swore off luxury, and held property communally; other members were attracted by the lifestyle based on Acts 2 adopted by the group. While Valk reputedly believed in the imminent return of Christ, the group as a whole was more attracted to the lifestyle suggested by Acts 2. While on their first visit to Amsterdam, Muller and Valk had met a group of Rappists, with whom they shared the idea that property should be held communally. Later scholars saw in the group's ideals a kind of communist ideology; such ideas were held by many other Protestant groups in the early nineteenth century. Like the Labadists, they accepted only \\"spiritual\\" marriages, without regard for the constraints of civil marriage. Requirements were that the marriage partners were 24 or older, that no one in the community objected, and that the wife would be obedient to the husband. Some in the community wished to have the wives in common as well; while Muller was alive there was no question of allowing this, but after his death the idea of sharing wives seemed to have caused a split in the community resulting in the trek to the United States, with the Zomerzorg members (who were better off financially) sticking to Muller's doctrine. Sources and legacy Much of the information on Muller and Leer's lives come from the latter's memoir. In 1860, Leer moved to Leiden to live in the Bethlehemshof, where she met the writer Louise Sophie Bluss√©, who wrote Leer's memoir and published it in 1892, under the pseudonym D.N. Anagrapheus, with a preface by Remonstrant preacher Jan Hendrik Maronier (1827-1920). An article on the group by the Dutch historian and lawyer Hendrick Peter Godfried Quack in De Gids drew international attention, as \\"a most interesting and instructive chapter in the history of social movements\\".

She is an activist who educates about disease and fights stigma against those who suffer from disease. In 2015 she was awarded the International Women of Courage Award by the US State Department. Biography Tchecola grew up in a small Guinean village near the Senegalese border. She was the first woman in her family to obtain an education. She earned her nursing credentials and was working as a nurse at Donka Hospital in Conakry, Guinea. In July, 2014 she contracted Ebola, while treating a severely ill patient. A shortage of healthcare workers and basic protective equipment created a situation in West Africa where the disease was spreading rapidly. Recognizing the symptoms, she checked herself into a treatment center to prevent the spread of the disease. She recognized from her own experience that denial, doubt, and misinformation can prohibit people from getting proper treatment and taking proper precautions. After recovering from the disease, Tchecola returned to her job as an emergency room nurse at Donka Hospital, but her troubles were not over. Tchecola's landlord evicted her, because of fear and misinformation about the disease. Others who survived have similar stories: friends stop visiting, employers won't let workers return, communities believe that Ebola is a death sentence and that victims will eventually die so they shun survivors, children and adolescents are rejected by family members and fear inhibits other placement for them. The situation with children is especially troubling. More than 4,000 children are registered as orphans in Guinea. Because survivors appear to have an immunity to the disease, they are being recruited by UNICEF to help with children. Survivors are able to touch and provide comfort to the traumatized children in a way that personnel in protective gear cannot. Tchecola is committed to raising awareness, educating about Ebola prevention, and fighting discrimination against survivors. She is a member of the Ebola Survivors Association of Guinea, which provides a support network for those who survived the disease.

The film features an ensemble cast, including Kate Mara, Anya Taylor-Joy, Toby Jones, Rose Leslie, Boyd Holbrook, Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Paul Giamatti. Filming began on May 26, 2015, in Northern Ireland. The film was released on September 2, 2016, by 20th Century Fox. Plot Lee Weathers is a \\"risk-management specialist\\" for genetic-engineering company SynSect. She arrives at a rural site hosting its L-9 project, an artificial being with nanotechnology-infused synthetic DNA named Morgan. The \\"hybrid biological organism with the capacity for autonomous decision making and sophisticated emotional responses\\" is smarter than humans and matures quickly, walking and talking within a month and physically a teenager despite being five years old. The cold and precise Weathers, who insists on calling Morgan \\"it\\", is at the site to assess the project while a psychologist evaluates Morgan, who has used a pen to stab Dr. Kathy Grieff in the eye. Over dinner with the team of eight scientists, Weathers and project leaders Dr. Lui Cheng and Dr. Simon Ziegler discuss an incident in Helsinki involving Cheng in which 21 SynSect researchers were killed in an hour by \\"crude prototypes\\". Lee learns that Morgan attacked Grieff when she was prohibited from leaving her room, a glass cell, after killing a deer impaled on a fallen tree while outside. The scientists have reared Morgan from birth following two failed attempts, and most consider her to be their child; Grieff defends Morgan to Weathers despite her injury, and Dr. Amy Menser wants to resume taking her on outings. Menser promises to take Morgan to a nearby lake that she describes as wonderful; the behavioral therapist understands that Morgan is, despite her intellect and physical appearance and abilities, emotionally childlike. Although Morgan considers Cheng to be her \\"mother\\", the scientist is pessimistic about the project; she admits to Weathers that she ended the outings as it is cruel to expose Morgan to a world she cannot be allowed to enter. Psychologist and artificial intelligence expert Dr. Alan Shapiro arrives to assess Morgan and quickly defies the scientists' requests to stay outside Morgan's room for the assessment. When Shapiro aggressively taunts Morgan as part of his evaluation, she becomes angry and spontaneously kills him. Weathers tranquilizes Morgan after a brief escape, and decides that she is too unpredictable and must be terminated. The scientists refuse to kill Morgan; before Weathers can do so, they shoot her with a tranquilizer dart and imprison her in the cell in which Morgan was held. The scientists plan to escape with Morgan, but after waking, Morgan, believing they have betrayed her, kills most of them, while Ziegler commits suicide. In the scientists' house, Cheng records an apology for the failure of the project. The scientists tried to make Morgan \\"more human\\" than the previous attempts so she could exceed her design as a combat weapon, but found that the result was harder to control. Morgan arrives and, after conversing with her \\"mother\\" in Chinese, manually suffocates her. Weathers escapes the cell and briefly fights Morgan, able to match her. Morgan flees with the terrified Menser, who Morgan says is the only scientist who was a real friend to her. Weathers and nutritionist Skip Vronsky follow the pair. Vronsky deduces that Morgan has forced Menser to take her to the lake, which entrances Morgan. She and Weathers fight again, seemingly matched in strength and speed. Morgan knocks down Weathers, who is impaled on the branch of a fallen tree. Morgan flees again and meets with Menser at the pier but Weathers, having survived the impaling, catches up and drowns her in the lake. She then shoots Menser and Vronsky before leaving the scene. Weathers's superior at SynSect and another executive discuss the incident. They decide that it proves that the company's earlier L-4 project is superior. Asked, \\"What about Lee Weathers?,\\" the superior says: \\"What about her? She's perfect,\\" revealing that Weathers is actually the L-4 prototype, lacking much of the emotional development Morgan had. Waiting in another room, Weathers makes the same gesture with her hands as Morgan did as she begins to contemplate her actions. Cast Production  Morgan, a sci-fi thriller scripted by Seth W. Owen, was placed on the 2014 Black List of Best Unproduced Screenplays. With 20th Century Fox attached as financier and distributor, Ridley Scott's Scott Free Productions was set to produce. On March 10, 2015, Kate Mara was announced as having been cast in the lead role, corporate risk- management consultant Lee Weathers; Dakota Johnson, Claire Holt, Lena Dunham and Carice van Houten were also considered, while Luke Scott, son of Ridley, was set to make his directing debut, with Ridley Scott producing, along with Michael Schaefer and Elishia Holmes. Anya Taylor-Joy was also added to the cast in the title role of Morgan, the genetically-engineered being. On April 29, 2015, Paul Giamatti and Toby Jones were cast as a psychologist and chief scientist in charge of the lab facility, respectively. Boyd Holbrook was also set to play a nutritionist at the facility, and Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michelle Yeoh were later cast in supporting roles. = Filming = Principal photography on the film began on May 26, 2015, in Northern Ireland. ReceptionBox office= In the United States, Morgan was released on September 2, 2016, and was originally projected to gross around $6 million from 2,020 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after grossing just $615,000 on its first day, weekend projections were lowered to $2 million. It went on to open to $2 million, finishing 18th at the box office. In its second weekend it grossed just $495,000, finishing 21st at the box office. It ultimately earned $8.8 million worldwide. =Critical response= Morgan has received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 38%, based on 151 reviews, with a weighted average score of 4.98/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Morgan neglects to develop its decent premise, opting instead to settle for a garden-variety sci-fi thriller with more action than ideas.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Keith Phipps of Uproxx praised the film's setup but criticized its execution, writing, \\"It floats a few interesting ideas it can't develop and it doesn't know how to ratchet up the tension or fold those ideas into thrills. And it's not like that can't be done with this premise, as Ex Machina already demonstrated.\\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one out of four stars, ranking the film #4 among his worst films of 2016 and saying: \\"The only thing worse than the first three-quarters of Morgan is the supposed payoff, which veers from the dumb to the really dumb to the so-dumb-you'll- hardly-believe it\\".

This project features the unlikely combination of images of animals with sliced up fruit and vegetables. In an interview, she stated that she \\"noticed the potential for a series stemming from an interesting juxtaposition between live animals and produce, rather than just different animal species. I found the combination of forms interesting and realized that it made a visually strong image that people would have strong opinions about. A lot of the project was a study in color and negative space, as well as creating a cohesive image through hybridizing, but I also just enjoyed creating something both amusing and potentially thought provoking.\\" When questioned as to whether or not the series was created as a statement on meat consumption, she noted that she \\"didn‚Äôt specifically create the series to be commentary on meat eating or vegetarianism. I have always enjoyed making pieces that were visually strong on their own, but also thought provoking and open to interpretation. I never create art to force my own view, but use it to inspire people to think about their own.

He and Fletcher's son, Phineas, had become fast friends. Against the wishes of his father, Phineas persuades John to take him to a theatre. The trip proves too much for the invalid, and John carries him home from the theatre in a fainting condition. Fletcher is furious with John, and drives him from the house. About this time there is a great discontent at the mill, among the workmen. Fletcher decides to close it down. After six weeks of starvation, the workmen and their families come in a crowd to the mill and demand that they be given the grain which is stored there. Rather than accede to their demands, Fletcher hurls the bags of grain into the river. This so infuriates the mob that they try to set fire to the mill and put an end to Fletcher. Unable to control the mob, John helps Fletcher, his son and Ursula, to escape. Finally he wins Fletcher's consent to compromise with the men. Realizing that he owes his property and life to John, Fletcher asks his forgiveness for his former harsh treatment. John becomes Fletcher's adopted son and wins Ursula for his bride.\\"  Cast  *Martin Faust as John Halifax *Frank H. Crane *William Russell *Violet Heming  Production  The production and an adaptation of Dinah Maria Mulock Craik's popular novel John Halifax, Gentleman. Originally published in 1856, it would be reprinted numerous times and established itself as a \\"classic\\" over the passing decades. At the time of the film's production Craik's works were very familiar to audiences. The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Sometimes the directional credit is given to Theodore Marston. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908‚Äì1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Path√©, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only known cast credits are for Martin Faust, Frank H. Crane, William Russell and Violet Heming. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list included G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Bowers lists this as the first known credit of William Russell, formerly of the Biograph Company. Russell would become one of the most important actors of the company until his final departure in 1913. It is not the earliest known appearance by Russell, as he is shown in a film still of A Thanksgiving Surprise. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on December 2, 1910. The film likely had a wide national release, advertising theaters are known in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Kansas, and Indiana. The film is cited by The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film as the earliest adaptation of John Halifax, Gentleman. The film was received conflicting reviews by both The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World said, \\"This well known story is rendered into a motion picture in a way that will please the most exacting. ... The picture proves that a good rendering of even an old story is attractive. The audience apparently delights in the character of John Halifax. He is quite as good on the curtain as he is in the book, and there he has always been a favorite. The different parts are played to perfection. The character of the daughter and the ill son are both faithfully reproduced and seem to live before the audience.\\" The Mirror reviewer The film is not as well acted as Thanhouser pictures usually are. The strict character of the old Quaker is insufficiently expressed and is apt to leave the audience to guess why John is ordered out, and the strike scene is far from impressive. The mob to a man wave their sticks incessantly, instead of portraying intense rage as should have been done.\\" Bowers noted that the Mirror was not a neutral party in respect to the works of the Independent producers.

The first stage returned to land at Cape Canaveral's Landing Zone 1 after separation of the first and second stage. Mission overview Launch of the CRS-13 mission In early 2015, NASA awarded a contract extension to SpaceX for three CRS additional missions (CRS-13 to CRS-15). , a NASA Inspector General report had this mission manifested for September 2017. The flight has been delayed from 13 September, 1 November, 4 December, 12 December, and 13 December 2017. SpaceX pushed off the launch to 15 December due to the detection of particulates in the second stage fuel system, taking the time to completely flush out the fuel and liquid oxygen tanks on the first and second stages as a precautionary measure.

In Eagle, Audrey. The Essential Audrey Eagle. Wellington: Te Papa Press, 2013, pp. 21‚Äì23.  Work  Eagle began in 1954 to paint plants in order to assist with learning their botanical names. By 1968 she started planning a book with examples of every genus of tree and shrub in New Zealand. In 1975, after more than twenty years of work, Eagle's Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand in Colour was published. The book contained illustrations of 228 species, reproduced in life-size, with meticulous notes on identification, distribution and the source of the illustrated material. In 1982, she published a second book, illustrating a further 405 species and varieties. Both books were revised in 1986 to bring the nomenclature up to date. However, as a result of botanical research, a further revision was necessary. In 2006 Te Papa Press published the two-volume edition incorporating all of Eagle's previous illustrations, together with a further 173 new paintings, under the title Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand. Honours and awards Eagle was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to botanical art. In 2007, the 2006 two-volume edition of Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand earned her the Montana Medal for Non-Fiction and the Booksellers Choice award.

The company performed his own plays, and he claimed that his tours with Kleptomania, Flying from Justice, Secrets of the Police, were all great financial successes.

People thought that the solar eclipse happened because of the death of the son of the Prophet. There is narration about it. When the prophet was informed of these words, he went pulpit and said: ‚ÄúOh people! Surely the sun and moon are signs of Allah that are moving by Verdict of Allah. Lunar eclipse or Solar eclipse does not occur by the birth or death of any person. So that when one of them or both is happened, pray Salat al-Ayat.‚Äù And the prophet pray Salat al-Ayat with people.

Because of his life, he has been neglecting his girlfriend, Katy (Ellen Chan) and would let out his frustrations on her. A acquainted police offiver Bad Breath (Billy Ching) informs Lui a rival named Chang-pau bets HK$40,000 against Lui in a race on Princess Margaret Road against one his racers Joe (Max Mok), who also owns an auto repair shop. Lui loans HK$20,000 from Bad Breath. On the night of their duel, Lui and Joe taunt each other before proceeding to race, where Lui was leading until near the end when Joe catches up and Lui rams Joe. The winner was undermined as a result and fight between Lui's and Chang-pau underlings breaks out until the police arrive and arrest Joe, Lui, and his younger sister, Ann (Rachel Lee) who fail to flee from the scene. At the police station, Lui's estranged father (Wu Ma), who is a seasoned officer, snacks and scolds Lui for his illegal activities and getting his sister involved. Before his father detains him, Lui rants about how his father is a hypocrite for being a corrupt policeman before the establishment of the ICAC and blames his father as the cause of him becoming a criminal. After being released from the police station, Lui's underling Bull (Karel Wong) reveals to him that Bad Breath attacked them and crashed into their shop for his debt while his henchmen also attacked Ann but was saved by Joe, who is trying to pursue her. Lui retaliates by blowing up Bad Breath's car and fights his henchmen beforethe police arrive. The next day Brother Bing tells Lui to settle with Bad Breath and that he will pay for the car blown up by Lui but Lui would have to give Joe to Bad Breath for beating up his henchmen while saving Ann. Lui is reluctant to do so since Joe saved his sister. Bull and his henchmen beat up and capture Joe and allows him to be beaten by Bad Breath and his gang before Ann and Katy arrive and bring him back home and Ann take care of his wounds after Katy leaves. Ann leaves after berating him for being afraid of his brother. Joe then chases after her and they later make love. The next morning, Katy arrives and warns Ann that her brother may find out of her relationship with Joe.

Lui then matches into Joe's apartment and attacks Joe before Joe's colleagues and the police led by Lui's father arrive. Lui leaves after Joe refuses to press charges on Lui and Ann is upset at his brother for his actions. However, when her father scold Lui, she also blames his father for often berating her brother and becoming what he is now. Katy also leaves Lui being tired of his cold treatment.

On the way, he gets challenged by a couple youngsters to a race where the youngsters crash their car before he brings Katy to talk with Brother Bing again that he wants to leave the triads for good. Lui and Katy finally reconcile but Lui insists to race with Joe as a way to end all conflicts. Lui also tells Bull and Fat Dog of his decision to quit and that they have the reward money if he wins the race. Lui and Joe then meet up and race, followed by Lui's underlings and Joe's colleagues in each of their respective cars.

The Star Tribune Company, 11 December 2010. Web. 27 February 2015. Background An elephant and her baby at Patara Patara Elephant Farm is a health-recovery and reproduction-management farm for elephants. Its focus is on educating the public on elephants and the threats they face. To do this, the farm pairs visitors up with an elephant for a day and assigns them the task of caring for that elephant.Rybak Caulfield, Deborah, \\"A Trunk Show in Thailand\\", Delta Sky Magazine. Delta/MSP Communications, June 2014. Web. 27 February 2015. As of December 2014, the farm is home to 55 elephants. It is located in the mountains near Hang Dong Valley, 45 minutes south of Chiang Mai, Thailand. It was founded in 2001 by a man named Theerapat \\"Pat\\" Trungprakan's and his wife Anocha \\"Dao\\" with the goal of preserving the elephant population in Thailand. Theerapat says there is much sacrifice involved, and says he and the other caretakers spend more time with the elephants than with their wives The elephants' caretakers, known as mahouts, are from a nearby Karen village and are paired-up with their own elephant to take care of. A mahout at Patara. =Mission statement and the four points of emphasis= Patara's conservation philosophy is \\"Extinction is Forever,\\" which is why their solution is elephant conservation through breeding. In order to preserve the Thai elephant population, the farm has four points of emphasis that they center their work around. These points are: rescue, recovery, reproduction, and reintroduction.\\"Transformational Learning,\\" 2014 Community Engagement Report (2014): 8. Center for Internships & Community Engagement. California State University, Fullerton, 2014. Web. 2 March 2015. Rescuing means taking elephants that have nowhere else to go. Theerapat says part of Patara's mission is to \\"adopt elephants people don't want anymore ‚Äì healthy ones with the potential to live 80 years and produce a baby.\\" One example is Noi/Nui, who was rescued from a circus.Adalid, Aileen, \\"Patara Elephant Farm in Chiang Mai,\\" Patara Elephant Farm. Patara Elephant Farm, 1 October 2014. Web. 27 February 2015. Patara also adopts elephants from the streets of Bangkok, who are used by their mahouts to get money from the tourism industry. Some of their elephants used to work in the illegal logging industry.Teo, Tracy, \\"Riding the gentle giant: A visit to Patara Elephant Farm,‚Äù The Tennessean. Gannett Company, 20 December 2014. Web. 27 Fed. 2015. Therefore, the rescued elephants recovery process is the farm's first priority.H., Vivian, ‚ÄúBaby Elephant Loves Cuddling with Arthur,‚Äù Patara Elephant Farm. Patara Elephant Farm, 27 September 2014. Web. 2 March 2015. For reproduction, Patara focuses on actual mating instead of artificial insemination. This is because Theerapat believes it is more successful. In terms of reintroduction, Patara releases its elephants into the wild whenever possible. However, Theerapat believes simply releasing them is not the answer since, in his words, \\"you can't just suddenly put domestic elephants into the wild. Their survival rates are too low.\\" Therefore, the farm's belief is that through education and one-on-one interactions with elephants, people will understand elephants and what is needed for their welfare.Perry, Martin, \\"The Big Dream,\\" Out There Magazine  International Homoculture. Out There Publishing ltd & Out There LLC, 2014. Web. 27 Fed. 2015. This is why Patara encourages visitors to come and learn about elephants by caring for them. In terms of reproductive success, so far they have breed 24 elephants in 10 years. Every year, around 2‚Äì3 baby elephants are born. Five baby elephants were born in 2013. The first baby who was born at the farm is a male elephant named Puchan. Program A trip to Patara consists of a hands-on-experience where each visitor is given an elephant to take care of for a half-day or a full day.McDonnell, Sharon, ‚ÄúElephants in the Land of Smiles,‚Äù Napa Valley Register. Lee Enterprises, 21 December 2014. Web. 27 February 2015. This program is called ‚ÄúElephant Owner for a Day,‚Äù and its goal is for visitors to better understand elephant health and behavior by caring for an elephant. These activities include feeding the elephant, checking its health, bathing it, learning how to communicate with it, and ride it. All visitors, including children and people with disabilities, are welcomed. Through these interactions, Patara hopes that visitors will develop a trusting relationship with their elephant.\\"About Us\\", Patara Elephant Farm. Patara Elephant Farm, 2014. Web. 27 February 2015. The program costs around $200 per person, and the groups are small, with a maximum of twelve visitors per day The program cost is needed since Patara does not receive any of its funding from the Thai government. =Arrival= Visitors heading to meet the elephants they will be paired-up with at Patara. When visitors first arrive at the farm, they are given shirts and pants traditionally worn by mahouts. Visitors are from all over the world, including the United States, Canada, Austria, France, Germany, Puerto Rico, and Singapore. Then, they are asked to sit down and Theerapat gives a talk on the history of domesticating elephants in Thailand, the state of elephants in Thailand today, and why the farm was founded. After the talk, visitors are led to an open area where the elephants are. Visitors are then called over by Theerapat to be paired-up with an elephant. Visitors are paired with elephants based on their personality in order to promote a good relationship between visitors and the elephants they are paired with. Visitors are also helped by the elephant's mahout who makes sure they properly care for and interact with their elephant. Furthermore, when baby elephants are at the farm, visitors are also allowed to interact with them while the babies mothers are nearby. =Education on elephant behavior= Visitors are also taught to read their elephant's behavior. They are told that elephants who are calm and happy wag their tails and wave their ears back and forth. When talking to an elephant, visitors are told that if the elephant responds, it is a good sign. To communicate with their elephant, visitors are taught the Thai words boun, which means \\"open your mouth,\\" and didi, which means \\"good.\\" Visitors learn these words when they are feeding their elephant right after they have been introduced. When first meeting their elephant, visitors are given a basket of food consisting of sugar cane, tamarind, and bananas to give to their elephant in order to make friends with them. Visitors are also taught that elephants express affection by putting their trunk around them. These are referred to as elephant \\"kisses.\\" A bull elephant at Patara. =Education on elephant health= Before checking the health of their elephant, visitors are given a demonstration on how to check an elephant's health. Checking their elephant's health includes checking for teeth health, intestinal health, and sweat gland health, and checking for sleeping problems. In order to check for intestinal and teeth health, visitors check their elephant's excrement. To check for intestinal problems, they are first told to count their elephant's number of droppings. If there are around six pieces per bathroom time, then the elephant is considered healthy because it has been eating enough. Elephants can eat around 300 pounds of food per day.Rybak Caulfield, Deborah, \\"A Trunk Show in Thailand,\\" Delta Sky Magazine. Delta/MSP Communications, June 2014. Web. 27 February 2015. Furthermore, visitors are asked to smell the elephant dung and make sure it doesn't smell bad. They are also asked to squeeze the dung to make sure it is not too watery. To check for teeth problems, visitors check to see if the dung is finely ground. If for example whole leaves are found in the dung, then the elephant's teeth are not working properly. Elephants have 6 sets of teeth in their lifetime, and lose their last set of teeth near the end of their life. If their food is not being properly chewed, this means they are old and nearing the end of their life.\\"Elephant Teeth,\\" EleAid. EleAid, 2015. Web. 1 March 2015. To checked sweat gland health, visitors touch near the base of their elephant's toenails to check for sweat. To check for sleeping problems, visitors check to see if their elephant has dirt on its sides. This is because elephants, who sleep for only around four hours a night, sleep on their sides while sleeping deeply.\\"Elephants  Behavior,\\" SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, 2015. Web. 28 February 2015. If they do not have dirt marks on their sides, then they slept standing up. Elephants who sleep standing up are generally sick. After the elephants' health has been checked, visitors are given a branch with leaves to sweep the dirt off their elephant's backs. To do this, visitors are told to gently pull on their elephant's ear to get them to sit down. The next stage in cleaning their elephant is when visitors and their elephants are led to a nearby waterfall bathing area.McDonnell, Sharon, \\"Elephants in the Land of Smiles,\\" Napa Valley Register. Lee Enterprises, 21 December 2014. Web. 27 February 2015. This is where the visitors begin to brush and bathe their elephant. To bathe their elephant, they toss water from the bathing area onto them with buckets. Visitors brush their elephant with hard-bristled brushes to get the dirt off of them. Bathing them is important, since when riding them dirt could get pushed into their skin and cause it to get infected. =Elephant ride= A mahout and his elephant at Patara. The day concludes with a barebacked elephant ride to nearby temples, waterfalls, or forests. To get up onto the elephants, visitors are given three options. First, to use their elephant's bent leg to climb up onto its back. Second, to sit or stand on their elephant's trunk, which lifts them onto its back. And lastly, to have their elephant sit down and climb onto its back. To ride their elephant, visitors are told to sit on their neck and to put their feet and knees behind their elephant's ears. To hang on, visitors put their hands on the top of their elephant's head. Importance Theerapat stresses that the reason Patara is important is to regrow the rapidly decreasing elephant population. The population is decreasing due to environmental threats and the elephant trade. In the 1800s, back when Thailand was Siam, it still contained around 100,000 elephants. Since then, the number has been declining. Over just the last 40 years, the population has decreased from around 6,000 to around 3,200. In terms of elephants in the wild, an official count has not been taken since 1991, and that count said there is only approximately 1,000‚Äì2,000 wild elephants.Hutchins, Lea, \\"Travel: Thailand‚Äôs great elephant debate,‚Äù The Washington Times. News World Media Development, LLC, 24 February 2015. Web. 27 February 2015. This is why Theerapat is hesitant for Patara be a farm that only releases elephants, instead of also breeding them. His reasoning is that, ‚Äútheir survival rates are too low. Plus there‚Äôs not enough forestland and food yet. And poachers kill them for ivory or steal their babies to put into a circus or zoo.\\" =Environmental issues and the elephant tourism industry= Elephants being used for logging. The major environmental issue that affects elephants is deforestation. Although Thailand has restored 10% of its forest and will restore 20% in the next 15 years, it is not enough for many elephants to live in. Another aspect of deforestation that affected elephants in the past is the teak trade. This is because elephants were used for labor in the destruction of these forests. Nowadays, using them for this kind of labor is not a major concern since teak logging was banned in Thailand in 1989. Even with this ban, some illegal logging activities still happen along the Thai- Burma border.\\"Elephant Facts,\\" Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary (BLES). Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary (BLES). Web. 28 Fed. 2015. Immediately after the 1989 ban, many laborer elephants were unemployed. This happened when the tourist industry in Thailand was becoming big, and therefore many of these elephants were bought to be used in the elephant tourism industry. =Street elephants= Since after the 1989 logging ban many mahouts were also left without jobs, many also contribute their elephants to the tourism industry by using them to beg in the cities. These \\"street elephants\\" are used to give tourists rides, and right now there are around 100 elephants in Bangkok being used to beg. This results in a minimum of 15 elephants being injured in traffic accidents per month. Since many of these elephants are separated from their mothers too young, their skin is not tough enough to protect them from the sun, their feet are not developed enough to work all day, and they do not have access to their mother's milk and are therefore malnourished. Furthermore, since they are exposed to gas from traffic for around 12 hours a day, they develop damage to their respiratory systems. The noise from this traffic can also damage their hearing.\\"Street Elephants,\\" Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary (BLES). Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary (BLES). Web. 28 February 2015. An elephant baby who is part of Thailand's elephant tourism industry. =Elephant trade= Elephants being ridden as part of the tourist industry in the Chiang Mai Province Much of the elephant trade is the result of tourism, and many other elephant farms get their elephants illegally by buying them from people who poach them from the wild.Campbell, Charlie, \\"Elephants Are Tortured and Trafficked to Entertain Tourists in Thailand,\\" Time. Time Inc., 8 July 2014. Web. 28 February 2015. Many of these elephants are captured in Myanmar, and are easily sold in Thailand on the Thai-Burma border. To capture them, they are herded into pit traps, where older elephant are often shot and younger elephants are captured and then sold. This is because tourists prefer to see younger elephants, which has made the current price for young elephants around $33,000.McGrath, Matt, \\"Cruel trade in Asian elephants threatens survival-report,\\" BBC News  Science & Environment. BBC, 6 July 2014. Web. 28 February 2015. As of 2015, it is estimated that every week, one baby elephant is smuggled into Thailand to become part of the elephant tourist industry. Once they are captured, they are beaten in order to be domesticated. This practice must be done before they can be ridden, and is called Phajeen, or \\"the crush\\". This practice is allowed to take place since elephants don't need to be registered by the Thai government until they are eight years old.McGrath, Matt, ‚ÄúCruel trade in Asian elephants threatens survival-report,‚Äù BBC News  Science & Environment. BBC, 6 July 2014. Web. 28 February 2015. It is also easy to say an elephant was born in animal and to fake their documentation about their birth and ownership. Even when they are registered, the laws that the Thai government has put in place to protect elephants are not always enforced. For example, although in 2012 the Thai government tried to stop the trade of elephants from Myanmar, between 2011‚Äì2013 it is estimated that up to 81% of elephants in the Thai tourism industry were illegally captured. At some elephant farms where these elephants are sold, elephants are controlled and made to do certain tricks by using metal bull-hooks and nails. These tricks include painting, dancing, and walking on two legs.

The RPM is not a single event but 6 events that are run consecutively. The RPM has been presented by the Marathon Canoe Club of South Australia since 1988. The other notable Paddling Marathon on the Murray is the Murray Marathon which is run further upstream in Victoria. The RPM 200 covers the entire distance on the Murray River from Martins Bend (a few km upstream from Berri) to Morgan (208 km). At first light on Saturday morning, paddlers leave Martins Bend and pass through lock 4 on their way to the finish at Moorook. Day 2, Sunday morning sees the paddlers again leave at first light from Moorook, passing through lock 3 and finishing at Waikerie. The Monday morning, the paddlers leave well before sunrise and head downstream, passing through lock 2 and finishing at Morgan. The RPM 200 is often quoted as one of the toughest Kayak marathon events in Australia by paddlers - with the 208 km in the middle of winter, where often paddlers start each day near zero degrees and even sub- zero temperatures are not uncommon on the Monday morning. It takes a truly dedicated Marathon Paddler to complete the RPM 200 The RPM 100 is the most popular event and attracts the highest number of competitive paddlers and covers a total of 93 km. The RPM 100 paddlers start mid-morning at around the 1/2 way mark for the RPM 200 paddlers each day. The RPM 200, 200Relay and the RPM 100 events maintain a fastest recorded time for the various classes, which adds another element to the competitive nature of the event. The Mini Marathon is a 10‚Äì12 km leg each day and serves as an introductory Marathon event. This event introduces first time Marathon paddlers and the more social paddlers to both the spectacular Murray River and to Marathon Paddling. The other options for the RPM are the RPM 200 Relay, SDS - Single day covering the RPM 100 course on the Sunday and the RPM 50 - Day 1 and 3 of the Mini and day 2 of the 100 and serves as a stepping stone from the Mini to the longer events. All events share a common finishing line each day, all starts are staged throughout each day with the aim of all paddlers regardless of their chosen event to finish within a 1-2 hour window.  History  The Riverland paddling Marathon has been run every year since 1988 and in the first year there was just the single 208km Event. The Legs for each day were chosen based on free campsites along the river at the end of each day. The next year the 100km event was added and over the years additional events were added to appeal to all paddlers.  Logistics  The RPM is unique in Paddling Marathon's in Australia where the majority of the Committee are committed marathon paddlers in their own right and paddle in either the 200 or 100 themselves. The event relies heavily on the numerous volunteers who make this event possible.  Craft and Classes  There is a wide range of craft and classes to choose from. Craft classes include the ICF K (Kayak) and C (Canoe) Classes, TK classes as well as several Recreational classes, including Sea Kayaks, Ski's and even SUP's (Stand Up Paddle Boards). The RPM also caters for 2 junior age classes - under 16 and under 18, the Open age class, and Veteran age classes - vet35+, vet45+, vet55+, vet65+ and vet70+.

The English company Brassert & Co began to build the metallurgical plant in Linz in 1938. After the air raids of the allied forces in July 1944, the entire facilities were severely damaged. By the end of the war, production had basically stopped. In July 1945, the \\"Alpine Montan AG Hermann G√∂ring\\" plant was renamed to \\"Vereinigte √ñsterreichische Eisen- und Stahlwerke\\" (V√ñEST) (United Iron and Steel Plants). For the plant‚Äôs reconstruction, some divisions were combined into the so-called ‚ÄúNew Building Division‚Äù, designed to reconstruct the metallurgical plant in Linz. Thus, the most important metallurgical facilities could all be started up again by the year 1949: the coking plant, blast furnaces, SM-steel making plants (plant with Siemens-Martin-furnace, named after inventors) and heavy plate mills (mills producing plates of over 3 mm thickness). Many of the products were scarce commodities after the war. For this reason, the metallurgical plant was able to recover pretty soon, investing largely into the expansion of its own facilities. Due to the shortage of steel scrap, necessary for the operation of SM blast furnaces, the yearly steel mill capacities of 220,000 tons soon proved to be insufficient. The solution was a new manufacturing process: the LD-process (Linz-Donawitz- process, also called oxygen steelmaking) manufactured in house and commissioned in 1952 in Linz, and 1953 in Donawitz. The huge advantages of this process were cost-saving on the one hand (investment costs were only 65% and operation costs only 55% compared to the SM blast furnace), and larger production capacities on the other. 1956‚Äì1973 Werksausbau began as a division of V√ñEST in 1956. The invention of the LD process and experiences gained from the complete reconstruction after the war led to the first external large-scale commission in the area of industrial plant construction in Rourkela, India, in 1958. It was a great success. Thereafter, many commissions from different metallurgical plants on almost all continents followed. The construction of industrial plants in the steel mill sector soon grew further, with the addition of hot and cold rolling mills as well as the construction of blast furnaces and metallurgical plants‚Äô additional facilities like granulation plants and dolomite plants. Due to the increasing amount of tasks, the New Construction Division had to be changed into \\"Industrial Construction and Plant Development\\" with a new focus on turnkey projects. 1964, V√ñEST expanded their portfolio once more, this time with the construction of chemical plants, which soon reached a share of more than two thirds of the total turnover. Another milestone was the introduction of the continuous casting technology for the production of slabs. The huge amount of commissions and the increasing expansion of their own facilities led V√ñEST to further increase their hot steel production from 2.3 to 3.1 million tons per year. During this time, the number of employees grew to approximately 4,000 people. An additional center of technology was built in Vienna and additional constructors from Austria as well as from other countries were flown in. In 1973, the two nationalized iron and steel industries V√ñEST and √ñsterreichisch- Alpine Montangesellschaft (Alpine) merged and became Voest-Alpine AG.The organization was restructured into the areas of ‚Äúmetallurgical plants‚Äù (seven divisions) and ‚Äúchemical plants‚Äù (two divisions). 1974‚Äì1994 When the oil crisis started in 1974, the metallurgical industry was severely affected in all parts of the world. The consequence was a significant decline in prices within the steel sector, which also affected the construction of plants. Still, the area of technology (industrial plant construction and ready-to-use industry) became increasingly important for the company. Thus, the metallurgical plant‚Äôs share of turnover was 80% in 1973 - however, in 1976, the share of the plant construction and ready-to-use industries already amounted to 45%. The company was faced with a lot of restructuring processes and new orientations, but also gained the largest projects ever. In the beginning of the 1980s, first steps were taken towards biotechnology, leading to the construction of a biomass utilization technology center in Linz. In order to adapt to market requirements, the construction of chemical plants also took further measures in the area of environmental protection. A very important step in this area was the acquisition of Korf Engineering GesmbH as a 100% subsidiary, since it included the rights to the COREX process. Because of the continuous high amount of commissions, the effects of the steel crisis were mitigated. However, in 1985 the crisis exploded and in the previous years, political pressure had already been put on the nationalized company with regard to job security. Therefore, the company, which had meanwhile become a diversified group, suffered a record loss in 1984, amounting to a total of 25 billion Schillings. In fall of 1986, the concept of Voest-Alpine NEU (Voest Alpine NEW) was introduced. This meant that the company now positioned itself as a market oriented technology company, which was based on the knowledge gained previously in the key area of steel. This concept should help the company to recover as quickly as possible. Established strong areas (quality and technology) and creative projects launched by employees were fostered in the construction of plants. Thus, COREX, horizontal continuous casting, and converter and electric furnace processes were further developed, and the electric arc furnace was introduced. Finally, in 1988, Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau (VAI) became a proper GesmbH in the framework of the newly established Maschinen-und Anlagenbauholding AG, which belongs to the parent company of √ñIAG. That same year, Voest-Alpine AG became Voest-Alpine Stahl AG, and VAI had sales of $636 million. 1995‚Äì2014 In 1995, VAI was unhinged from Voest-Alpine Stahl and became a 100% subsidiary of the new VA Technologie AG (short: VA Tech). VAI operated in 45 countries and had 2000 engineers, with revenue of $841 million. As of 1997, VAI had about 4000 employees, had 100 orders totalling $3 billion, and had completed 620 projects in 80 countries. Voest-Alpine Stahl owned 21.25 percent of the stock in VAI's parent VATech. In September 1999, VAI completed its acquisition of the Norwegian-owned Kvaerner A.S.A. metals equipment group, including operations in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, China, India and Great Britain. This ranked as the most beneficial of several acquisitions preceding the company's most difficult year; in 2001, the steel industry worldwide experienced a downturn due to lower prices, though continuous casting (for which VAI was the world's top company) continued its positive results, especially in China. VAI reduced its six business areas to four: Iron & Steelmaking (the largest); Rolling & Processing; Automation, and Metallurgical Services. VAI subsidiary Voest-Alpine Industries Inc. had its American headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1999, Voest-Alpine Industries, part of VA Tech North America, moved all its Pittsburgh operations to Southpointe in Washington County. At the time, the company had just taken over Kv√¶rner A.S.A.'s metals equipment group. Voest-Alpine Industries also operated in Eastlake, Ohio and Benton Harbor, Michigan. The metals automation division of Voest-Alpine Industries relocated from Eastlake to Southpointe in 2002. In 1995, VAI bought its first shares of Fuchs Systems Inc. (Fuchs Systemtechnik GmbH), a German-based manufacturer of electric arc furnaces and other equipment for manufacturing steel, with plants in Mexico and Salisbury, North Carolina. The Salisbury plant had 230 employees in 1997. As of 1999, Voest-Alpine Industries owned 49 percent of Fuchs. Although the company laid off 59 employees in Salisbury, Fuchs was \\"the market leader\\", and the parent companies intended to keep Fuchs in business. The layoffs resulted from an economic crisis in Asia, as well as lower demand for American steel resulting from the low import prices. However, the Asian market was returning by 1999, and Europe and South America were also possible new markets. In May 2001, however, Fuchs closed the Salisbury plant, its only American facility, because half the customers were bankrupt or close to it. AlloyWorks bought three of the buildings, and the fourth became a medical office. A church used one of the buildings from 2002 to 2008. In 2001, Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau bought the rest of Fuchs Systems, which became VAI Fuchs and added VAI Technometal. Also in 2001, VAI's continuous casting operation added a casting and rolling mill for ultra-wide medium thickness slabs for IPSCO Steel in Mobile, Alabama, with what were believed to be the world's largest one-piece cast mill housings at 350 tons. The automation business completed a quality control project along with Voest-Alpine Stahl. In 2003, VAI subsidiary Voest- Alpine Services & Technologies Corp. became majority owner of Steel Related Technology of Blytheville, Arkansas. After the Siemens purchase of VA Technologie AG completed in July 2005, VAI became Siemens VAI, a part of the Siemens Industrial Solutions and Services Group. Siemens VAI was later named Siemens VAI Metals Technologies GmbH & Co. and also referred to as VAI Group, which was created from VAI and Siemens electrical engineering and automation businesses. Siemens Group Industrial Solutions and Services also included Voest-Alpine Services and Technologies (VAST). Both Siemens units operated from the Pittsburgh area. VAST provided mill maintenance services to steel and aluminum manufacturers from eleven locations: Baltimore, Maryland; North East, Maryland; New London, Ohio; Milan, Ohio; Benton Harbor, Michigan; Bethel Park, Pennsylvania; Blytheville, Arkansas; Charleston, South Carolina; Decatur, Alabama; and Erie, Pennsylvania in the United States and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario in Canada. =Merger= Creation of Primetals Technologies was announced in 2014. Mitsubishi acquired 51% of Siemens VAI. Primetals Technologies became operational in January 2015.

In order to achieve this situation, there are three central assumptions within neoclassical economics that are indispensable for achieving an optimal allocation. These assumptions include that people are rational, both individuals and firms maximise utility, and everybody has full and relevant information, which they act upon independently. Graphically, static efficiency is obtained when the net benefit is maximised. This means that the marginal benefit (MB) is equal to the marginal cost (MC). Different forms of static efficiency There are two main types of static efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency is reached when goods and services are produced with an optimal combination of inputs, resulting in the maximum output at the lowest costs. A firm is said to be productively efficieducing at the lowest point on the average cost curve. This is where marginal cost meets average cost. Allocative efficiency takes into account the preferences of the consumers and the efficient allocation of resources. Graphically this point is reached when price is equal to marginal cost. At this point there is no deadweight loss, and the social surplus (consumer surplus + producer surplus) is maximized. It is possible that productive efficiency is reached while there is no allocative efficiency at that same point in time. Static efficiency vs. dynamic efficiency Static efficiency is efficiency in terms of the refinement of existing products, processes or capabilities. On the contrary, dynamic efficiency takes into account the development of new products, processes, and capabilities. Achieving static efficiency may not be consistent with achieving dynamic efficiency. Monopoly power can, for example, undermine static efficiency; but the resulting accumulation of wealth can promote improved dynamic efficiency if it is used to finance increased investment, thereby promote accelerated rates of growth.

The works are known for their extremely chromatic idiom.  History  This cycle of motets is said to have been given as a personal gift to Albrecht V. of Bavaria, Lassus' employer, after his arrival in Munich. By the time he had begun work in Germany, Lassus had already enjoyed great success in Italy as a composer for Costantino Castrioto, and was looking to make a new name for himself. The motets were first published in 1600, after Lassus' death in 1594, by his son Rudolph. There remains, however, a small amount of disagreement over the dates of the original manuscript. Boetticher suggests the date to be around 1550-52, during Lassus' time in Naples, while Alfred Einstein prefers a date between 1555 and 1560, by which time Lassus could have seen depictions of the sibyls in places like the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and in the Borgia Apartments of the Vatican.Bergquist, Peter, (Author). \\"The Poems of Orlando Di Lasso's Prophetiae Sibyllarum and Their Sources.\\" Journal of the American Musicological Society 32.3 (1979): 516-38. RILM Abstracts of Music Literature. Web. 28 Sept. 2015.  Analyses  Crook (1998) claims that the introduction, \\"Carmina Chromatico\\", has become, \\"probably the most analyzed piece of Renaissance music by any composer in any genre,\\"Crook, David (1998). \\"Tonal Compass in the Motets of Lasso\\", Hearing the Motet, p.287. Pesce, Dolores; ed. Oxford. . since Lowinsky's 1961 discussion of the prelude's \\"triadic atonality\\".Lowinsky, Edward (1961). Tonality and Atonality in Sixteenth-Century Music. Lasso, \\"uses all twelve tones; he builds triads on ten different degrees, six of which result in harmonies foreign to the mode. ... Rendering the Sibylline prophecies in chromatic style, the young genius probably implied that chromaticism was the music of the future.\\" This can be understood by studying the Prologue to the cycle. The texture remains triadic, typical of the polyphony of that time, but modulates so often that the listener quickly loses the original tonal center. Lowinsky's discussion has led to other quandaries on the topic of the tonal coherence of the prologue. William J. Mitchell, takes issue with Lowinsky's conclusion and suggests that \\"perhaps the erosion of any stable tonal center is less the fault of Lasso, who seems to have made a splendid effort, than of the analysis which is indeed atonal.\\" Berger, Karol, (Author). \\"Tonality and Atonality in the Prologue to Orlando Di Lasso's Prophetiae Sibyllarum: Some Methodological Problems in Analysis of Sixteenth-century Music.\\" The Musical Quarterly 66.4 (1980): 484-504. RILM Abstracts of Music Literature. Web. 28 Sept. 2015. These debates are ultimately built on the question of theorists' license to analyze the piece through our modern lens of tonality and atonality.  Poems  The Prophetiae Sibyllarum text is made up of one three- line prologue and twelve six-line motets. All of the poems are in dactylic hexameter. The prophesies, each told by a different prophetess, tell of the coming of Christ. Given the Renaissance's fascination with mysticism and antiquity it is no surprise that Lassus would choose these prophesies as his text.Harvey, J. (2010). A beginner's guide to prophecy: Orlande de lassus's \\"prophetiae sibyllarum\\". Choral Journal, 50(11), 8-17. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/753557145 The extremely chromatic setting of this text points toward Lassus' interactions with Cipriano de Rore and Nicola Vicentino, both known for their experiments with chromaticism, during his time at St. John Lateran. Lowinsky also speculates that \\"rendering the Sibylline prophecies in chromatic style, the young genius probably implied that chromaticism was the music of the future.\\"Lowinsky, Edward (1961).

He has been the CEO and president of The Hertz Corporation, and was the CEO and president of Caesars Entertainment until 2019. Prior to his July 2015 appointment as Caesars' CEO, he had spent his career working in various management positions for General Electric, Philips Lighting Company and Aeroquip-Vickers, as well as CEO and chairman of Tenneco and Hertz. Frissora entered his role as CEO of Tenneco in 2000. Prior to stepping down in 2006, he was attributed to raising Tenneco's revenue by 39 percent for a total of $4.4 billion. Frissora subsequently joined The Hertz Corporation as CEO in 2006. On January 1, 2007 he became company chairman. Frissora was named by Business Travel News as one of the most \\"Influential Business Travel Executives\\" of 2012. While holding his position at Hertz, Frissora was an active participant in international business groups including Business Roundtable, the World Economic Forum, McKinsey CEO Advisory Council, and the G100. Frissora was presented with the Oliver R. Grace Award for Distinguished Service in Advancing Cancer Research in 2012. He stepped down from Hertz in September 2014. Early life and education Frissora was born in August 1955 in Columbus, Ohio where he spent his childhood. He earned a B.A. from Ohio State University and later attended Babson College in Massachusetts. Frissora later enrolled in Thunderbird School of Management in Arizona where he studied executive development. CareerEarly management roles (1977‚Äì2000)= Frissora began his career in 1978 at General Electric. Throughout his time there, he gained experience in marketing, sales, and brand management. He remained with the company until 1987. In 1987 he moved on to Philips Lighting Company, where he served in multiple management roles. His positions included Director of Sales and Director of Marketing. He went on to Aeroquip-Vickers as Vice President from 1991-96. In 1996, Frissora repositioned to Tenneco where he would again serve in several management positions. His initial role was VP of North American Emissions Control Operations for Walker Manufacturing. Frissora later served as Senior VP and General Manager of Tenneco's worldwide original equipment business from 1998 until March 1999. He was appointed as Tenneco's CEO and its President of Automotive Operations shortly thereafter in April. He joined Tenneco's Board of Directors, of which he was elected chairman, in March of 2000. The Press of Atlantic City alleged that Tenneco Automotive had been \\"circling the drain\\" and struggling with significant debt. The news source also reported Frissora was selected as CEO for his ability to \\"lean things out ‚Äî for identifying process flaws by looking beyond the balance sheet to re-engineer what's actually happening on the ground at a company's plants.\\" =Growth at Tenneco (2001‚Äì2006)= As CEO and chairman, Frissora targeted growth markets and sought to diversify revenue streams. By 2004 he had developed revenue boosting strategies in a number of platforms, logistics, customers, markets and product lines at Tenneco. Tenneco improved the market share positions for a number of its products. However, in 2004, Tenneco earned a net income of $13 million, which represented a 52% drop from its 2003 figure. The company attributed this drop to restructuring changes and higher steel costs. The following year marked \\"the first time Tenneco put together two consecutive profitable years since the current configuration of the company was launched in 1999.\\" By February 2005, and since 1999, Tenneco's share price had tripled. Around that time the company earned two top Automotive Industry shareholder awards for delivering the highest one-year and three-year shareholder returns of any automotive supplier. By July 2006, Tenneco's revenue had risen 39 percent, or $4.4 billion, since 1999. The Press of Atlantic City attributed much of the success to Frissora noting his achievement as \\"honing in on strong sectors of the parts market ‚Äî investing heavily in lucrative emission-control products; ramping-up operations in China's burgeoning auto market; and aligning Tenneco with Japanese carmakers, who were capturing a sizable share of North American auto sales.\\" =Appointment to Hertz CEO (2006‚Äì2013)= In July 2006, Frissora accepted a position as CEO of The Hertz Corporation, a global American-headquartered car rental company, on the eve of the company's initial public offering (IPO). In January 2007, Frissora was subsequently appointed chairman. He oversaw the company through a number of major transitions. That summer Hertz offered discounts on gasoline and other fees in order to make car rentals more customer-friendly and affordable. Frissora oversaw the acquisition of Donlen Corporation, a fleet leasing company, in 2011. In November of that year Hertz introduced ExpressRent kiosks, in what was the first large-scale deployment of live video chat in car rental kiosks. Other strategic developments during Frissora's tenure included engineering Hertz's November 2012 acquisition of Dollar-Thrifty Automotive Group for $2.6 billion, after a two-year bidding war with Avis Budget Group. The deal significantly expanded Hertz's car rental brand portfolio and yielded combined annual sales of . As part of the deal, Hertz also sold its low-cost Advantage brand, and gave up 29 Dollar Thrifty airport locations. According to Reuters at the time, \\"the acquisition is expected to save the merged company at least $160 million annually and cement Hertz's No. 2 position in the global car rental rankings.\\" Hertz's shareholder value increased significantly during this period, and by May 2013 Hertz had realized a return of 230% on their shares since going public. Frissora credited both the Donlen and Dollar Thrifty acquisitions with enabling Hertz to broaden current market reach, and providing exposure to new markets, via leasing, fleet management consulting, and managing fleet acquisitions and dispositions more efficiently. =Expansion of Hertz Corporation (2013‚Äì2014)= In May 2013, Frissora announced Hertz would relocate to Estero, Florida from New Jersey, with the new building to combine staff from both Dollar Thrifty and Hertz. The relocation was to be completed in 2016. By November 2013, Hertz was the \\"largest publicly traded rental car operator in the United States.\\" Hertz stated revenue increases of 34 percent, and up to $10.8 billion, between 2006 and 2013. By that time worldwide car rental revenues went up 37% and up to $8.7 billion; U.S. off-airport locations doubled, revenues increased by 45%, and the total number of locations increased from 7,600 to 11,200. In 2014 Reuters wrote that Frissora was \\"credited for the shrewd acquisitions that helped Hertz to grow into a $12.7 billion company - more than two-and-a-half times its value when it listed in 2006, shortly after Frissora took the helm.\\" In the summer of 2014, activist investors at Hertz asserted they lacked confidence in management due to reported \\"accounting mistakes and internal control issues\\". Consequently, activist investors pushed for board and management replacements including Frissora. Citing personal reasons, he resigned as CEO, chairman, and director on September 8, 2014. Frissora officially left the roles in November that same year. Hertz reported Frissora's departure was \\"without cause\\". =Appointment to Caesar's CEO (2015)= In February 2015, Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced Frissora would be replacing Gary Loveman as their new CEO and president, effective July 1, 2015. Frissora immediately joined the board and Loveman temporarily remained Caesars' chairman to help with the transition. Although Caesars had been the world's largest casino company a decade earlier, the Wall Street Journal noted that by 2015 the company's revenues had suffered from a failure to expand sufficiently in burgeoning Asian markets, as well as incurring billions in debt amidst a 2008 buyout. Several weeks prior to Frissora's January appointment, the company's casino operating unit had voluntarily filed for reorganization through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Caesars Entertainment Corp. awarded its chief executive officer $29.4 million in compensation for 2017, the year the casino operator emerged from bankruptcy. Mark Frissora received a $2 million salary, $4.5 million cash bonus, $16.5 million in retention-restricted stock, a long-term cash award of $6 million and $400,000 for repriced options, the Las Vegas-based company said Tuesday in a regulatory filing. As CEO designee from February to July 2015, Frissora stated he had \\"visited most of [Caesars'] domestic properties, met with all of the company's senior leaders\\" and focused on \\"identifying new opportunities to drive growth and efficiency.\\" Thereafter, he joined the board of Caesars Entertainment Corporation and was appointed president and CEO of Caesars Enterprise Services (CES), as well as the CES Steering Committee. On April 16, 2019, Caesars announced that Affinity Gaming CEO Anthony Rodio would be transitioning into the role of Caesars CEO within 30 days, replacing Frissora, who announced his intention to step down in November 2018. =Push for new gaming platforms (2016-2017)= After officially assuming position as of CEO and President of Caesars Entertainment in September 2015, the press quoted Frissora at the Global Gaming Expo stating he had been \\"shocked\\" with the lack of innovation in the casino industry at large, noting a lack of marketing that targeted millennials. At the conference he announced new experiments by Caesars to appeal to younger gamblers. One experiment in particular would include a \\"casino within a casino\\" on the Las Vegas Strip with interchangeable walls to change the feel of the space as needed. Frissora added they would be pursuing \\"skill-based slots\\", recently legalized by the state of Nevada, and that the company was \\"experimenting with changing traditional slot machine playing by involving social game features such as leaderboards that track high-point players.\\" Under Frissora's leadership, in November 2015, Caesars announced it would cede management of its Horseshoe Casino Cleveland, Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati, and ThistleDown Racino resorts to Rock Gaming, with the transfer to be completed by June 2016. As of October 2016, Frissora continued focusing on bringing in new games that appeal to younger casino customers. According to The Economist, among other projects he \\"wants to open up their gaming platforms to allow young players to choose their games and compete against each other on the casino floor,\\" with \\"skill-based\\" shoot-em- ups and \\"video-game gambling machines\\" from companies such as GameCo. In November 2016, Caesars Entertainment announced that it had \\"surpassed its Green Key Global certification goal\\" by having 90 percent, or thirty total, of its properties in North America be rated \\"4 Key\\" or higher in terms of sustainability. Frissora credited the rating to the company's \\"CodeGreen team\\", whom initiated ways to reduce the resorts' environmental impact, and a \\"strong corporate commitment to sustainable practices.\\" Frissora rang the opening bell for Nasdaq in New York in October 2017.Las Vegas Sun - ‚ÄúCaesars executives to ring Nasdaq's opening bell‚Äù, Thomas Moore, October 23, 2017 The press noted in October 2017 that Caesars was successfully recovering from its bankruptcy.Barron's ‚ÄúCaesars Returns to Building Its Gaming Empire‚Äù, Andrew Bary, 21 October 2017 Frissora outlined plans to investors to further franchise its brands with other partners, renovate rooms, introduce new entertainment and food, and also finish development on a convention center in Las Vegas, among other projects.Richard N. Velotta, Las Vegas Review-Journal: ‚ÄúCaesars executives outline Las Vegas growth plans‚Äù, October 24, 2017. Non- executive board and council memberships Frissora has been involved with a number of boards and organizations beyond his direct employers. In June 2002 he joined of the board of NCR Corporation, holding a directorship at NCR until November 2009. He became a director of FMC Corporation in January 2004, a role he held until August 2006. In December 2009, he became a director at both Delphi Automotive PLC, and Delphi Holdings LLP, also joining Delphi's finance committee and their nominating and governance committee. Furthermore, in December 2009 he became a director of Walgreens Boots Alliance, holding the position until April 1, 2015. As a Walgreen Co. director, he was chairman of their finance committee as of 2014, as well as a member of their nominating and governance committee. He was chairman of Walgreens finance committee until he left the board in April 2015. He has been a member of the Business Roundtable since before 2005, and is on the World Economic Forum's Automotive Board of Governors. He is also a member of the G100. Recognition and awards Frissora was named No. 5 on Business Travel News' list of the 25 Most Influential Business Travel Executives of 2012. In addition, he was presented with the 2012 Oliver R. Grace Award for Distinguished Service in Advancing Cancer Research by the Cancer Research Institute. Personal life Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, Frissora is divorced, and has four children.

After its formation in 2012 as the \\"Muthanna bin Haritha Vanquisher of the Persians Battalion\\" (), it expanded to a sizable group. The group has been described by the As-Safir newspaper as \\"one of the most powerful armed factions in Daraa\\". The group has joined multiple operations rooms. The movement worked with a unit of Ahrar ash-Sham called the Harmayn Brigade and the al-Nusra Front in July 2013. The group worked with another unit of Ahrar ash-Sham named Aknaf Bayt al-Muqadis as well as three other Islamist groups on 20 October 2013. The movement joined an operation room with other hardline Islamist groups in Daraa on 3 March 2015 which included the al-Nusra Front, Ahrar ash-Sham and Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis. Although the group is considered close to al-Nusra, there were reports it declared its support for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in March 2015. It subsequently came into conflict with the Free Syrian Army-aligned Liwa al-Mutaz Billah group. However, on 25 March 2015, it supported the FSA in taking the town of Bosra. In January 2016, it came into conflict with the Southern Front and the Yarmouk Army after it was accused by them of \\"kidnappings, assassinations and intimidation\\" and harboring sympathies for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In March 2016, Muthanna and the Pro-ISIL Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade fought against fighters from al-Nusra Front and Ahrar ash-Sham over control of villages near the border with Jordan and the Golan Heights. On 29 March 2016, dozens of their members splintered-off to form an FSA-aligned group called al-Murabitin Brigade. In April 2016, there were reports that Muthanna Movement had merged with the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade,https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/719864098876440577 although the group denied these reports at the time, in May 2016 Muthanna, Jaysh al- Jihad and the Martyrs Brigade announced they had united together as the Khalid ibn al-Walid Army.

The fountain is located in Bendigo's \\"Charing Cross\\", the intersection of View Street and Pall Mall. Charing Cross effectively stands at the centre of the city and is one of Bendigo's busiest and most prominent intersections. The fountain stands opposite to the main entrance of Rosalind Park. Alexandra Fountain was funded from the proceeds of the Bendigo Juvenile Industrial Exhibition (1879), a ¬£500 gift from George Lansell and a further ¬£700 from the Sandhurst City Council (now the City of Greater Bendigo). The fountain was designed by William Charles Vahland (1828-1915), a local architect responsible for some of the cities most prominent buildings. The fountain was named in honour of Alexandra, Princess of Wales and the grand opening (5 July 1881) was attended by her sons Prince Albert and Prince George. Other than the Exhibition Fountain, built in 1880 and located in the Melbourne's Carlton Gardens, the Alexandra Fountain is the largest and most ornate municipal fountain in Victoria. The fountain stands high and sits in a diameter circular pool which itself is deep. It is made from of Harcourt granite, cast iron and painted stone. Decoratively the fountain includes lion head spouts, four allegorical female figures, spouted bronzed mer-horses and dolphins, medallions of seashells, dolphins and tridents also decorate the fountain. The pool is bordered by a decorative cast iron fence and lit with four cast iron lamps. Historically the fountain is a monument to the success of the Goldfields and the Bendigo region. Aesthetically the fountain is fairly typical of late Victorian monumental design but is unusual in that few fountains were built according to this theme. As of 2017 a AU$350,000 refurbishment project is underway. The restoration project will include repairs and repainting of the balustrade and masonry, including repainting and re-rendering the plaster work as well as plumbing and electrical work.

The original name of the band was Deers, but they changed it at the end of 2014 after a threat of legal action from the similarly named band The Dears. The group chose \\"Hinds\\", a word that means \\"female deers\\", as the new name of the band and officially implemented the name change on 7 January 2015. They have released three albums, one compilation LP and four singles. Their first studio album, Leave Me Alone, was released on 8 January 2016, and their second studio album, I Don't Run, was released on 6 April 2018. The band's third studio album, The Prettiest Curse was released on 5 June 2020. HistoryDuo= Hinds started in 2011 as a duo called Deers, consisting of Carlotta Cosials and Ana Garc√≠a Perrote. After a break of a year and a half, the duo reformed in 2013. In March 2014, still as a duo, they recorded the tracks \\"Bamboo\\" and \\"Trippy Gum\\" and released both songs in Bandcamp as \\"Demo\\". The single was praised by music magazines including NME and by Paul Lester of The Guardian who chose Deers as \\"new band of the week\\" in September 2014, and by major musicians, such as Patrick Carney, The Pastels, and Bobby Gillespie. =Four piece= After releasing \\"Demo\\" the duo became a four piece, with close friend and former guitar player and singer Ade Mart√≠n on bass and the Netherlands-born Amber Grimbergen on drums. In May 2014, Deers won the \\"Make Noise Malasa√±a\\" festival contest and were rewarded with recording their second single \\"Barn\\" in Converse Rubber Tracks Studio in Berlin.

During this time they received positive reviews in Pitchfork, Pigeons and Planes, Gorilla vs. Bear, The Irish Times, Paste, and DIY. On 3 November 2014, they released the single \\"Barn\\" with the tracks \\"Castigadas en el granero\\" (\\"Punished in the Barn\\") and \\"Between Cans\\". Once again it was released by Lucky Number and was well received by the press. =World tour= Hinds in London during their 2015 world tour In 2015, the band embarked on their first world tour, having already played Thailand and Australia in February and the United States in March, and played many major festivals, including Festival Internacional de Benic√†ssim, South by Southwest (where they played 16 concerts in just four days), Burgerama, Best Kept Secret and Dot to Dot Festival. =Leave Me Alone= On 13 April 2015, they began recording their debut album, with and Diego Garc√≠a (from The Parrots) as producer and engineer respectively.

It includes more diverse instrumentation than previous albums, as well as singing in Spanish. In an interview with The Forty-Five the band explained their decision to change their management for this album: \\"We were under a lot of pressure from our team, part of our management. They started blaming us for venues not selling out. Everyone was frustrated and it made us really sad.\\" During the pandemic, Hinds recorded a video performance of two songs, \\"New For You\\" and \\"Come Back and Love Me\\". The video was recorded separately at each band members' home and edited together for release through Rolling Stone's website.

Explaining why they chose that song, the band said, \\"As Spaniards, we don‚Äôt usually get shout-outs in songs, like New York or London, so the Clash writing a song about our civil war made us feel honored.\\" They released the song on 31 July 2020 and performed it on 21 August 2020 during a live stream 68th birthday tribute show to Joe Strummer called \\"A Song for Joe: Celebrating the Life of Joe Strummer\\".

Despite its name, there is only passenger service on the section on Greek territory, between Alexandroupoli and Ormenio, as the international services to Sofia (via Svilengrad) and IstanbulGreece severs international links, International Railway Journal, March, 2011 (\\"Friendship Express\\") have been suspended as of 2011. https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/rail-nip/nip-ccs-tsi- bulgaria-en.pdf Course The southern terminus of the Alexandroupoli‚ÄìSvilengrad railway is Alexandroupoli railway station. About 30 km east of Alexandroupoli the line starts following the river Evros upstream on its right bank. At Pythio, between Didymoteicho and Orestiada, the line to Istanbul branches off. It reaches , the current terminus of all passenger services, shortly before crossing the Bulgarian border and continuing to , where it joins the railway from Sofia to Istanbul. History The section between Alexandroupoli (formerly Dedeagatch) and Svilengrad was opened in 1874 by the Chemins de fer Orientaux (CO) when the entire Thrace was part of the Ottoman Empire. The part between Pythio and Svilengrad was part of the CO main line from Istanbul to western Europe. After World War I and the subsequent Greek-Turkish War from 1919 to 1922, and finally peace in the form of the Lausanne treaty, the Chemins de fer Orientaux (CO) ended up having a network straddling Turkey and Greece. This created operational difficulties, each country having now its own set of rules and regulations, currencies, and languages. In order to resolve this situation, the CO decided to split itself into two companies: one for the Greek part, one for the Turkish part of the railway.Le Journal des finances, Paris, 27 December 1929 (in French) After the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923 and the borders between Greece and Turkey were drawn, the line was in Greek territory with the exception of a long section from Nea Vyssa to Marasia via Karaaƒüa√ß that was in Turkey. In order to get from Alexandroupoli to Dikaia, Ormenio and Svilengrad in Bulgaria, trains of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (Chemin de fer Franco- Hellenique) and later of the Hellenic State Railways would travel through Turkish territory. Trains stopped at , which in Greek timetables was listed as (Adrianoupolis)/Edirne. The CO created the \\"Companie franco-hellenique des chemins de fer\\" (CFFH) as a subsidiary company. The CFFH was incorporated in July 1929 as a French company and its headquarters was located in Paris. The CO transferred to the CFFH the Greek part of its line from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kmModen measurement done on www.Openstreetmap.com indicate 10.2 km in Turkey serving Edirne Karaaga√ß station and for about 3 km between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria.Le Journal des chemins de fer, des mines et des TP, Paris, 29 March 1930 (in French) Overall, this line was 165 kmSee Alexandroupoli‚ÄìSvilengrad railway. The railway is 178.5 km long minus 10 km in Turkey and 3 km in Bulgaria long route from the Aegean Sea port city Alexandroupoli to Ormenio the last station in Greece before entering Bulgaria. Pythion station was the junction towards Turkey. Along with the infrastructure, the CO transferred also some motive power and rolling stock to the CFFH. The CFFH stock was transferred to CO shareholders on the basis of 1 CFFH stock for every 5 CO stock.Le Journal des d√©bats, 10 March 1931 (in French) These CFFH stock started trading on the market in July 1931. Regarding the Edirne Karaaga√ß railway enclave so to speak, the CO retained operating rights over the section Svilengrad to Pythion to be able to reach Edirne and even Svilengrad. On the other hand, the CFFH retained operating rights through the Edirne section of the line to access the Greek part of the line past Edirne, through to Svilengrad. When the Turkish part of the CO was sold to the Turkish railways, these operating rights were also sold, enabling TCDD to reach Edirne with its own motive power, albeit with a CFFH driver. Likewise, when Greek State Railways (SEK) took over from the CFFH, they kept the operating right through Edirne Karaaga√ß. Operational working was facilitated by a provision in the Lausanne treaty allowing for trains to cross the borders in and out of Karaaga√ß without border control not custom taxes.Trait√© de paix entre les puissances alli√©es et la Turquie, Lausanne, 1923. Article n¬∞107 These rights survived until 1971 when TCDD inaugurated its own line from Pehlivank√∂y to Edirne & Svilengrad fully on Turkish territory. Edirne railway realignement in 1971 At the same time, in 1971, SEK designed and constructed a direct connection between Nea Vyssa and Marasia within the Greek borders, thus avoiding Turkish territory and bypassing Karaaƒüa√ß and with a new intermediate station at Kastanies. The new passing loop section, which includes a new bridge over the river Ardas is still in use. The former CO station in Edirne Karaaƒüa√ß, west of the Maritsa, was not no longer served by either TCDD or by SEK and went into disuse. The tracks lifted and the building converted to other use. The CFFH was the only railway connecting Turkey to Europe and enjoyed the related traffic and revenue. Some prestigious trains like the Orient Express transited on CFFH network. Otherwise, the CFFH did not generate any major traffic, either freight or passengers along its line. During the Greek Civil War until 1949, the trains operated only by daylight and were supplemented with empty freight cars in front of the locomotive and armed with escort to protect them from mines. SEK took over operations of the line and rolling stock, effective 1 January 1955, and CFFH ceased. In 2020 it was announced that section of line between Pythio and Ormenio was to be upgraded, at a cost of ‚Ç¨1.4m as part of an ambitious integrated intergovernmental transport plan which will see this, and 39 other transport sector projects be built, with financing from the European Commission with a total of ‚Ç¨117 million.http://v4.deltatv.gr/index.php?option=com_k2&view;=item&id;=25313:Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≤Œ±Œ∏ŒºŒØŒ∂ŒµœÑŒ±Œπ- Œ∑-œÉŒπŒ¥Œ∑œÅŒøŒ¥œÅŒøŒºŒπŒ∫ŒÆ-Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒÆ-ŒøœÅŒºŒµŒΩŒØŒøœÖ-œÄœÖŒ∏ŒØŒøœÖ&Itemid;=213 The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport.

The word is a portmanteau word, coming from the prefix \\"pre\\" and the word \\"retirement\\". The state is being found primarily in first world economies, with aging populations. A \\"Pre-tireree\\" will continue to create economic wealth and/or contribute to the generation of knowledge by research, likely on a part-time or reduced hours basis. Some \\"Pre-tirerees\\" use the period to give back by providing unpaid social support. This form of unpaid work creates economic benefit, by allowing taxes to be focused on other wealth creating or protecting activities, but relies on the existence of sufficient financial resource.  Research  The emergence of a new blend of work and retirement was established in Consumer Intelligence research in December 2014. Here are key findings from the research published in a report by Zopa (2014):\\"Britons opt for Pre-tirement over Total Retirement\\" * ‚ÄòPre-tirement‚Äô begins in 50s and runs well into 70s, as Britons ease themselves into retirement * Britons cut working hours earlier in life, but continue in paid employment for longer: 17% of over-65s are still in paid employment and 30% of them are in unpaid employment * 89% of 50- to 54-year-olds say they do not know when they will retire, and 35% expect to retire later * Only 24% of those 55‚Äì64 said they would be financially secure if they had to retire immediately * Giles Andrews, Zopa CEO: 'Retirement is no longer about clearing your desk on your 65th birthday' The concept appears to be similar to semi-retirement, but the term indicates a half retirement form, without indicating the gradual shift towards a fully retired end state or the non-existence of retirement. One position that may be extrapolated from the research is that a growing number of individuals hope to be healthy enough to get Pre-tirement until they die.  Causes and effects While the research shows that a number of individuals chose to shift to this state, it also shows the existence of Enforced Pre- tirement, individuals a pension that will support their living costs. Further research will be needed to establish the different types of Pre-tirement states, and their root causes. The use of the term retirement to encompass Pre-tirement would hide this emerging state. Effects of different forms of work retirement balance have not yet been fully researched. Early findings show that an abrupt shift from Full Time Work to Full Time Retirement can cause depression and other negative health effects. Consideration of the positive benefits of Pre-tirement are likely to be accelerated as the impact of the aging population starts to take deeper effect.  Usage  First found in a Blog by The Martian Observer (2010) The Blog's use of the neologism matches the term described in the Zopa Report. First used in a book title by Kris Miller (2012),\\"Ready for Pretirement: 3 Secrets for Safe Money and a Fabulous Future\\" though her usage describes planning for retirement, rather than an emerging state of employment. The ACAS website referred the important shift in retirement norms observed in the Zopa Report: \\"many people are choosing to ease into retirement in a 'phased or gradual process'.\\"Gradual 'pre-tirement' is 'here to stay'\\" Use of the neologism in news publications peaked after the publication of the Zopa Report. \\"Guardian: What is pre- tirement? A way for the over-50s to stagger (towards) retirement\\" \\"Daily Express: Gearing up for Pre-tirement the new trend for over 50's\\" Usage has been heard on the Radio 4 Today Program March 2015 Esther Rantzen used the term when discussing The Silver Line.

He held the position of principal flute in the Mannheim and Munich court orchestras under directors Johann Stamitz and Christian Cannabich, and was acknowledged as one of the finest virtuosos of his time.  Biography  Wendling was born in Ribeauvill√© (Rappoltsweiler), Alsace. He was employed at the court of Deux-Ponts (Zweibr√ºcken) from 1745 and joined the Mannheim court orchestra in 1752 as principal flautist.Lipowsky, p. 387.Anspacher, p. 33. He married the soprano Dorothea Wendling n√©e Spurni in Mannheim on 9 January 1752. Wendling went on many successful concert tours throughout Europe,Lipowsky, p. 387. including several times to Paris where he performed at the Concert Spirituel.Mercure de France (Paris), 1751‚Äì1780. In 1778 he relocated to Munich with the court orchestra and continued to perform. He died in Munich.Wendling's death \\"aged 74\\" on 27 November 1797 is recorded in the register of the Catholic church of Our Lady (Frauenkirche) in Munich. Wendling was renowned for his virtuosity and for his expressive playing, and his influence as a performer can be found in the compositions of all the important composers of the Mannheim school, including Johann Stamitz, Ignaz Holzbauer, Christian Cannabich, Anton Fils, and Ignaz Fr√§nzl. He had significant personal and musical contact with Johann Christian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and influenced their conception of the capabilities of the flute.Clive, pp. 176‚Äì177.G√§rtner, pp. 269‚Äì272. In 1778 Mozart wrote the solo flute part of his Sinfonia concertante (K.Anh.9/297b, lost) for Wendling,Eisen and Keefe, p. 221. which is believed by some to be related to the Sinfonia Concertante for Four Winds (K.Anh.C14.01). In 1781 Wendling took part in the premiere of Mozart's opera Idomeneo in Munich, with his wife Dorothea performing the part of Ilia and his brother's wife Elisabeth the part of Elettra. Ilia's second aria contains a four-part obbligato for flute, oboe, bassoon and horn, composed by Mozart for Wendling and his colleagues.Eisen and Keefe, p. 221. Wendling was also active as a flute teacher, not only of noble amateurs but also of the next generation of professionals. His most notable pupils were Duke Christian IV of Deux-Ponts, Elector Carl Theodor of Mannheim, the Duke of Guines, Johann Baptist Becke, Johann Georg Metzger, Johann Nikolaus Heroux and Jakob Heinrich Appold.  As described by his contemporaries  The Mozart family heard Wendling play in a concert in Schwetzingen on 18 July 1763. Leopold Mozart wrote the next day: :\\"I had the pleasure to hear, besides good singers of both sexes, the admirable flauto traverso, Wendling.\\"Holmes, p. 24. The German pianist and poet Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart heard Wendling in Mannheim in 1773 and later wrote: :\\"Wendling, an excellent flautist who knows how to combine true principles with finished execution. His performance is clear and beautiful, and his tone equally full and incisive in the low and high registers. He is more proud of bringing out the beautiful and the pleasing than the difficult, rapid or rushed.\\"Schubart, pp. 143‚Äì144. Another contemporary, the Bavarian lexicographer Felix Joseph Lipowsky, wrote: :\\"Wendling was one of the foremost flute players of his time, and was universally treasured and renowned as one of the greatest virtuosos of this instrument. He made several tours, and found extraordinary acclaim in all the great cities, and courts of kings and princes. When he played the flute at the Concert Spirituel in 1780, he won great honour, universal glory, and the loudest applause.\\"Lipowsky, p. 387.  Works  Wendling's works were published in France, England, Holland and Germany, and they all feature the flute. His works are now being re-issued by major international music publishers, including Schott, Henle, Heinrichshofen, Eulenburg, and Hug. A quartet in G major published under Wendling's name (as op.10/6, Nagel, 1957) is a misattribution.This quartet is actually by Friedrich Hartmann Graf.

Administratively, Taylor Hill is in the Newsome Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, the latter of which includes all of Huddersfield and surrounding areas. History The former chapel in Taylor Hill road On 15 March 1812, Taylor Hill was the site of the first large-scale Luddite operation in the West Riding, when the cloth- finishing shop of Frank Vickerman was attacked. Vickerman had previously been involved in coordinating the military and civil response to the Luddite threat, and a warning letter had been thrown into his premises several days earlier. Despite a guard being set on the premises, the Luddites succeeded in destroying ten shearing frames, 30 shears, a quantity of wool and every window in the building. Industry The former Vickerman & Sons Ltd woollen mill, on Fairlea Road has been converted into several smaller industrial units, which include a carpet manufacturers, commercial & industrial photographers, printers and lithographers, wedding cake bakery, Wrought ironwork services, clothing manufacturers & wholesalers and an independent domestic energy assessment services. The former Victorian village chapel has been converted into a Hydraulic engineers.

A Padmshri awardee, Kanhai is described as an artist with the midas touch. Introduction Krishn Kanhai is a master in contemporary, portrait as well as traditional gold painting. He has, however, not confined himself to the traditional alone but has also introduced certain significant techniques of his own that makes the canvas aesthetically appealing and spiritually rich. He started painting on folk themes while still in his teens during 1976 and gradually came to evolve a style of his own, which bore his personal stamp. It did not take much time for him to get known, as the precursor of the Yamuna Ghat painting school. Has painted thousands of portraits on the now perishing theme of Radha-Krishna and their tales. Call him a fusion artist, if you like for making beautiful use of enchanting Radha- Krishna postures and turning them into contemporary modern art, eye catching and unforgettable at once. Stand before a Kanhai portrait of Krishna and, very often, you lose the sense of time as you keep on gazing at the Lord of Vrindavan, which seems to cast a spell over the on looker. He often uses pure gold and precious gems as raw material for his paintings. Following in the footsteps of his father and mentor Padmashri Kanhai Chitrakar who himself was a renowned Krishna and Radha artist, young Krishna was encouraged by his father to carve his own niche, which he did earlier than expected. It is seldom, if ever that a father and a son have been honoured with a national award like Padmashri. Career A life size portrait of Atal Bihari Vajpayee former Prime Minister of India, painted by Kanhai, hangs in the Central Hall of the Parliament at New Delhi, which was inaugurated in February 2019 by President of India, Ramnath Kovind in the presence of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and several others. Modest to the core, Kanhai is an artist of International fame known to the political elite of the world, with several Presidents and Prime Ministers among his clients whose portraits were done by him in 2000. The list includes names like Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former Deputy Prime Minister of India Lal Krishna Advani, Bill & Hillary Clinton, Barrack Obama and his family, besides the eminent industrialist Aditya Birla and his wife Rajshri Birla together with, one of her own kind politician, film actor and dream girl Hema Malini. For his outstanding and original contribution to the art of portraits, painting, the Government honoured him with Padmashri in 2004. He is also recipient of the National Kalidas Award 2009-10 from the Government of Madhya Pradesh as well as Yash Bharti Award from Uttar Pradesh Government (2015), and many more. In 2016, on request from the Uttar Pradesh Government, he painted Life-size portrait of 22 Chief Ministers of UP- past and present along with 19 past and present Speakers of the UP Assembly besides two life-size portraits of Mahatma Gandhi. The paintings of the father-son duo are so highly acclaimed in the art circles of India that in 2004, Two research scholars, one Sangeeta Gupta of Bhimrao Ambedkar University Agra and the other Mohd. Wasim of Jiwaji Rao University, Gwalior were awarded Ph.D's on Kanhai (Father) and Krishn (Son), respectively.

From a banking family, he followed his father Henry Huth's interest in book collecting, and helped found the Bibliographical Society of London. Life alt= Born in London on 14 January 1850, he was second son of Henry Huth and Augusta, third daughter of Frederick Westenholz of Waldenstein Castle in Austria. When not quite 12, Huth was taken away, with an elder brother, from school at Carshalton, to travel in the Middle East under the care of Henry Thomas Buckle, the historian. The tour, which began on 20 October 1861, was broken off by the death of Buckle at Damascus on 29 May 1862. Huth's education was continued at Rugby School in 1864, and later at the University of Berlin. In 1892, Huth took part in founding the Bibliographical Society, acting as its first treasurer and subsequently as president. During these years he lived at Bolney House, Ennismore Gardens, in Knightsbridge; and later moved to Fosbury Manor, near Hungerford. Huth died on 14 October 1910, from heart failure, while out shooting with a neighbour in Hampshire. He was buried at Fosbury, Wiltshire. Collector Nautical chart, c. 1600, from the Huth Collection With an ample fortune, Huth devoted himself to study and collecting. After the death of his father in 1878 a fine library passed into his possession, and he saw to completion in 1880 the catalogue which his father had begun to print. Book collecting formed one of his chief interests to the end of his life. Legacy By his will, Huth directed that on the sale of his collection the trustees of the British Museum should have the right of selecting 50 volumes from it; a catalogue of the books chosen was published in 1912.

Due to its popularity, the city organizes a number of activities. The festival begins on 27 April in Plaza de la Diputaci√≥n, where a stage is prepared for the traditional Basque dance groups. San PrudencioPatron saint= San Prudencio, the patron saint of √Ålava, was an anchorite and priest who became bishop of Tarazona. He was named the patron saint of √Ålava in the mid-17th century. Prudencio is believed to have been born in Armentia and died in El Burgo de Osma, Soria on 28 April; the year is unknown. =Life= Prudencio was born and raised in Armentia, a small village which is now within the municipality of Vitoria- Gasteiz. When he was 15, he became an anchorite and moved to Soria under the tutelage of Saturio. Prudencio remained there for at least seven years, when he removed to Calahorra. In Calahorra, he is believed to have performed miraculous cures and converted many people to Christianity. Prudencio was well-known, and was visited by many ill people. He moved to Tarazona as a priest, maintaining its church and becoming an archdeacon. After the death of Tarazona's bishop, Prudencio succeeded him. He went to Burgo de Osma to mediate a dispute between that diocese and its clergy, where he became ill and died. Since Prudencio died outside his diocese, his resting place was disputed. According to legend, he was placed on his horse for the horse to determine where he would be buried. He was reportedly interred six leagues from Logro√±o. =Canonization and veneration= Prudencio was reportedly canonized on 24 April 759 at the monastery of San Mill√°n de la Cogolla. On 18 November 1643, he was named the patron saint of the province of √Ålava. Basilica The Basilica of San Prudencio de Armentia is in the southern suburbs of Vitoria-Gasteiz. Built in the late 12th century and remodeled during the 18th, it was listed as a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural on 4 June 1931. The basilica was renovated between 1773 and 1776, replacing its 12th-century fa√ßade and walls. In 1979, its name was changed from San Andr√©s to San Prudencio. Festival √Ålava organizes several activities for the two-day festival, which begins on 27 April. The Retreta opens the festival on the night of 27 April in the Plaza de la Diputaci√≥n, where a tamborrada similar to the Tamborrada in San Sebasti√°n takes place with trumpets, drums and Basque dance groups. According to a local newspaper, the first tamborrada connected with the San Prudencio festival was held in 1975; the festival itself has been held since at least 1964. The following day, a fair is held with traders and craftsmen. A popular song is sung during the festival: Spanish: > Suena el tun, tun y con √©l la trompeta, Es la retreta de nuestro patr√≥n. > (Bis). Los alaveses, en este d√≠a, con alegr√≠a y con buena uni√≥n. Celebran > fiestas a San Prudencio, a San Prudencio su patr√≥n. Suena el tun, tun y con > el la trompeta, Es la retreta de nuestro patr√≥n.

Dog fashion is a distinctive trend of the style in which people dress their canine companions. This trend dates back to the Egyptian pre-dynastic period and has since expanded due to increased consumer capitalism.  History  Dog dressed up, Eskilstuna, SwedenThere is evidence from ancient Egypt that people were using decorative collars to adorn their dogs. One collar was discovered in the tomb of the ancient Egyptian nobleman Maiharpiri in 1440 BC. It depicts hunting scenes embossed into leather. The dog's name, Tantanouit, is visible on the collar. He was a favorite dog of the nobleman who wished to bring him to the afterlife. There are also silver, gold, silk and velvet decorative dog collars from the time of King Henry VIII which were used to represent how many battles the dog survived. During the Renaissance, dogs were seen as objects of possession and thus collars were fitted with padlocks where only the owner of the dog had the key. Nobility and the upper class have been decorating their canine companions for centuries and there is photographic evidence from 1900 of people dressing their dogs in human costumes. Today, it is common for people to dress up their dogs, particularly small dogs, and canine clothing has become a global phenomenon. In 2011, there was a dog fashion show in New York called Last Bark at Bryant Park. Dog fashion and style has been greatly influenced with the advent of the internet. New professions have arisen driven by consumer capitalism, such as the pet style expert.  Clothing  A Westiepoo wearing a coat Dog dressed as a Peapod, San Francisco, California Dog clothes are available in various price ranges, from inexpensive to high- end designer styles. Typically toy and small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas and Yorkshire Terriers, are dressed in dog clothes, although even large breeds like Golden Retrievers can wear clothes, too. It is more common to dress small dogs because they are easier to dress and they often suffer from cold temperatures. Dog clothes are made to be either functional or for show. Functional dog clothes are for protection from the elements and allergens. Dog clothes that are purely for show would be used as costumes for holidays and special occasions, such as Halloween or weddings. Dog coats are most commonly used for protection against the rain and cold and to provide extra warmth. Dog coats are also used as fashion accessories. Dog sweaters are both functional and fashion accessories. They provide extra warmth for dogs that are hairless or suffer from the cold and come in an array of patterns and styles, such as cable knitted sweaters or hooded sweatshirts with embellishments. Dog shirts can be used to help keep a dog clean and as fashion accessories. They can also be used to help protect a dog who is excessively scratching itself due to allergies or prevent hairless dogs from getting sunburned. They are available in a t-shirt style with short or long sleeves as well as a sleeveless tank top for use during warmer weather. Dog dresses are purely fashion accessories and are mainly worn on toy and small breed dogs.  Fashion shows  There is a clear distinction between pet shows and pet fashion shows. The pet fashion show's emphasis is on the clothes, not on the dog. In countries all over the world, pet fashion shows are becoming increasingly popular During these shows, well groomed pets strut down the runway wearing high fashion clothes. Some well known designers such as Alexander Wang have designed outfits for dogs.  Designer fashions  Dog coats, collars, cute sweaters, shirts, stylish dresses, and booties are some of the items people purchase to adorn their dogs with style. Some major international fashion retailers such as Ralph Lauren have launched their own canine clothing lines. Louis Vuitton has a line of leashes and collars for dogs with their trademark LV pattern. Swarovski also has a line of collars and leashes for dogs with crystals.  Statistics  The canine fashion industry has become a multibillion-dollar business set to top ¬£30 billion in 2015. In the US, expenditure on pet supplies including clothing has been steadily increasing for the last twenty years with 2014 estimated spending at $13.72 billion. In 2014, an estimated 26.7 million US households own a dog and an estimated 83.3 million dogs are kept as pets in the United States. The dog fashion industry is projected to continually grow.  Sociological perspective  Dog dressed in an airplane outfit Humans typically have deep attachments to their dogs because dogs are adept at fulfilling emotionally supportive roles in people's lives which results in high levels of attachment. Dog owners who are single, childless, newly married, empty nesters, divorced, or in a second marriage tend to anthropomorphize their pets more often. Dogs can be emotional substitutes for family members such as children and spouses and they contribute to the moral maintenance of people who live alone. Dogs have become increasingly important and treated as unique individuals. In a world where people are increasingly disconnected from their families they rely more on their pets, specifically dogs, to fill emotional voids. Pets have become a relatively easy and lovable replacement for children or a strong community. Humans have been dependent on animals as sources of companionship and artistic inspiration since the Paleolithic Period, and animals have continued to mold the shape of human culture and psychology ever since. = Consumer capitalism viewpoint = Dog dressed as a Texans cheerleaderIncreasing affluence means that more people can spend resources on items that are not necessary, like clothes and costumes. People express themselves through fashion. As Georg Simmel says, \\"Style is the manifestation of our inner feelings and through style we demonstrate our taste, values, and status. We project all of those qualities onto our dogs when we dress them.\\" The appearance of a dog reflects the status of the owner: dressing a dog is more about the owner than the animal. When an owner dresses up their dog they establish a unique bond with the dog that places them at an even more personal and intimate level.  Media  Dogs are often shown in movies dressed up in clothing and costumes. This reflects the contemporary trend of dog fashion. In films such as Oliver and Company, one of the characters is a female dog, Georgette, who indulges in luxury fashion and wears leopard print scarfs, big hats and jeweled collars. In the Disney film Beverly Hills Chihuahua, a family of chihuahuas portray small dogs wearing fashionable clothes including sunglasses, hats, shirts, dresses, jeweled collars, and bandanas. In one scene, a wedding takes place between two dogs where the female dog wears a bridal gown and the male dog groom wears a tuxedo.

It was released on 30 June 1986 by Som Livre, along with her television program in Globo. The LP was sales record with more than 2.6 million copies, becoming the best-selling album in Brazil and South America.  Background  At age 23, the model and presenter of Rio Grande do Sul Maria das Gra√ßas Meneghel was hired by Globo - who paid a fortune to get her out of the Manchete, where she presented the Clube das Crian√ßas (Children's Club) since 1983 - to present the Xou da Xuxa, of the morning program won the title of \\"Queen of the Baixinhos\\" and the leadership in the audience in the mornings of the Brazilian TV, with an average of 7 million spectators daily. His musical career had begun in 1984 with the album Clube da Crian√ßa.  Recording  With the success of the program, Globo Network, decided to continue investing in the musical career of Xuxa, who had begun a year earlier with the release of their first studio album Xuxa e Seus Amigos (1985). Guto Gra√ßa Melo was contracted to produce the disc. When Guto met Xuxa, he realized she could not make a single note. Not knowing what to do, Guto appealed to the president of Som Livre Jo√£o Ara√∫jo, who said \\"If seen. He invents an album to do with it.\\" As Xuxa did not know how to sing, she was constantly annoyed in the studio for not being a singer. Xuxa to help during the recording, Guto called a girl who did backing vocals for him, Nina, and produced like Xuxa character with the mannerisms that Guto would like her to do. After recording with Nina, Xuxa spent days and days listening to recordings on her headset trying to imitate the singer. Guto revealed that since there were no equipment to tune the voice at the time, Xuxa sang on several channels and he reduced to one of the best moments. Xuxa recorded each song \\"hundreds of times\\" until arriving at the ideal voice. During the process of selecting songs for the album, Guto revealed that no composer wanted to give music to Xuxa. Guto revealed that he wanted to \\"put composers who were not exactly childish.\\" \\"Quem Que Queo\\" was composed by Aretuza, then a press officer for the label. She created the song as a joke for her children to eat. The proposal of the Free Sound was that the album had letters for children with arrangements made by the national rock musicians, this explains the presence of Rita Lee compositions Roberto Frejat, Guto Goffi and the participation of Evandro Mesquita and Patricia Marx (at that time still an integral of the Trem da Alegria) in the album. Released First album in the record company Som Livre, the Xou da Xuxa, arrived at the stores in the first week of August 1986 in the formats of LP and tape cassette. The album was released on CD for the first time in 1996, with two bonus tracks \\"Parab√©ns da Xuxa\\" (Congratulations from Xuxa) and \\"Papai Noel Dos Baixinhos\\" (Santa Claus from Baixinhos), which were originally released on the Xuxa Karaoke LP. The CD was reissued in 1996 and 2006. The \\"Garoto Problema\\" (Trouble Boy) version present in Xou da Xuxa re-releases is different from the version in the original disc run. In this version, the intonation in the voice of Xuxa and the conversation between the presenter and Evandro Mesquita are different. In 2013, Som Livre in partnership with Xuxa Productions, launched the Xuxa Collection of Xuxa, a box with all 7 discs released at the time of the program, and with it a CD with unpublished songs, chosen by the fans of the presenter. Commercial performance The album sold about 100,000 copies in the first week, thus being certified as a gold record. It sold 250 thousand copies in the second week and thus the number of copies was increasing every week. When reaching the mark 2.5 million copies sold, Jo√£o Ara√∫jo, president of Som Livre, had to stop making records saying \\"Or we make a record to sell or a [premium] record.\\" Producer Guto replied: \\"Invent a diamond disk, make a platinum-like album, slip a little diamond and give it to your artist.\\" The bandage was a record for the time, overcoming the bandages of the \\"phenomenon\\" RPM and King Roberto Carlos. The album accumulated the mark of 2,689,000 copies sold. The song \\"Doce Mel (Bom Estar com Voc√™)\\" was positioned as the 4th most played song in Brazilian radio in the year 1986.¬´Jornal do Brasil. \\"Xuxa com seu LP continua em 1¬∫ lugar\\" (16/11/1986)¬ª Even after three decades of its release, the songs on the album are pretty much performed in the 2010s. Congrats to Xuxa is one of the most played songs at parties, according to Ecad's survey (Central Office of Collection and Distribution). which controls the collection and distribution of copyright. Promotion As the songs served as the theme of Xuxa's Xouga program, basically the entire album was performed and performed in the attraction. Outside of the morning, two tracks of the album won music videos in the Fant√°stico (Fantastic): \\"Doce Mel\\" and \\"Turma da Xuxa\\". There are rumors that Xuxa would have participated in the program Cassino do Chacrinha (Chacrinha's Casino) singing one of the songs on the album, but to this day, no record has yet come to prove it. On August 9, 1986, the same week of the album's release, Xuxa held a show at Playcenter S√£o Paulo to promote the album. From this presentation, there were other invitations to concerts, thus forming the Xou da Xuxa tour. The only show that has video records so far, is the Santa Clause Arrival in Maracan√£, Rio de Janeiro, held on November 29, 1986. Legacy Xuxa's first Xou da Xuxa series title, as well as his songs, his language with children was of great significance for Brazilian pop culture and for the country's music market. Still in the first months of contract with Rede Globo the Veja magazine published a long story in 1986 talking about the success of Xuxa and calling for the first time presenter of \\"Children's Queen\\". For the magazine the success of the presenter was due \\"especially because it was innovative, creative and had some peculiarities, such as the language in first person, that made the children feel an air of proximity, as if she were talking to each one of them.\\" For Guto Gra√ßa Mello who co-produced the album, \\"the success of the album and the presenter is a result of Xuxa's empathy with the children's audience and a void that was in a segment that consumes its products with an impressive voracity to this day.\\" The portal Buzzfeed quoted that Xuxa taught great lessons to children who accompanied her at that time in Brazil. A critic of Forum magazine, she highlighted the contribution of the album to the Brazilian music industry and its impact even after thirty years of launch. \\"Nearing her 30th birthday, Xuxa's first album, as a presenter of \\"Xou\\" at Rede Globo, reveals when her career as a singer (even without a dowry to be), emerged in the musical scene with the sound of the time, beating records of sales with Roberto Carlos and the RPM, revealing to be the star of the record Som livre. A real phenomenon.\\" He also attributed the success of the formats of vinyl and cassette in Brazil to the high repercussion of the album \\"Xou\\" of 1986 sold about 2 million and a half copies, with cross plan facilitating the purchase of the product in vinyl and cassette, at a time when phonographic piracy was not such a harmful reality.\\" He even put the track ‚ÄúDoce Mel‚Äù as one of \\"the most memorable songs from the album's repertoire.\\" defining the introduction of the song as \\"shocking\\" and reminiscent of songs like \\"The Final Countdown\\" by Swedish band Europe or \\"Jump\\" by American band Van Halen, \\"for the rocky outline of the track, surrounded by synthesizers with guitar solos performed by Robson Jorge. Xuxa became a Brazilian pop culture icon immediately after his second release of his recording career. The singer was called \\"A pop product that worked,\\" By the second the critic of the site, the presenter is a clear and pure example of Brazilian pop culture. \\"Among polemics and commotions the blonde has become a symbol of reference for Brazilians of all ages and in various segments.\\" After the release of the album and its high sales Xuxa would be recognized around the world as the \\"Children's Queen\\" for being the child singer with highest selling of world history. The site Terra compared the singer to American singer Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson saying that just as \\"Elvis Presley earned the nickname of rock king because it was the most successful artist of the style in the years that followed the emergence of the genre; Michael Jackson, for having influenced a whole generation of pop artists, creating a new reality for music videos and reaching unthinkable levels of sales of live albums and shows.\\" Likewise Xuxa \\"was dubbed the \\"Queen of the Little Ones.\\" In all the ways in which the blonde with easy smile and blue eyes got involved, the result was the same: as a model, she became a record holder of magazine covers in Brazil; on the big screen, created a new and unprecedented standard for children's programs; in music, is still among the Brazilian artists with the highest number of albums sold; in the movies, the result repeats itself.\\" The album was considered responsible for other children's presenters to launch as singers of the genre. The album cover also became quite popular in Brazilian culture, becoming extremely popular, On July 11, 2011 appeared on Tumblr the page \\"Xuxa is all around!\\", which compiles photos of fans imitating the iconic pose of Xuxa on the cover of the album, inviting the public of the site to send his photo redoing the pose. The site quickly reached national fame, turning news in several portals.

He left the IRS in 1980 to return to private practice. Kurtz was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 19, 1931. He received a bachelor's degree in accounting from Temple University in 1952 and his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1955. He then enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he served for two years. He married his wife, artist Elaine Etta Kahn, in 1952. During the Johnson administration, Kurtz was employed as a tax legislative counsel for the United States Department of Treasury from 1966 to 1968. He was a vocal opponent of policies which favored higher income taxpayers during his tenure at the Treasury Department. Kurtz also did preliminary work on the Tax Reform Act of 1969, which created an alternative minimum tax aimed at wealthier taxpayers who took extensive tax deductions. Kurtz returned to private practice after leaving the Treasury Department. He was a partner at Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen, a firm in Philadelphia, prior to his appointment as head of the IRS in 1977. Jerome Kurtz was appointed Commissioner of Internal Revenue by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Kurtz sought to reverse tax policies that were seen as excessively beneficial to wealthier tax payers. For example, he targeted so-called \\"silver butterfly\\" commodities transactions, in which investors in silver staggered their losses and profits to lower their taxes on the sales. Under Kurtz, the IRS launched a crackdown on the abuse on tax shelters by both corporations and individuals. Kurtz also moved to tax \\"fringe benefits,\\" such as the use of company cars by employees, but those plans were quashed by the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. Kurtz stepped down as Commissioner of the IRS in 1980. He returned to private practice at the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison firm in Washington D.C. He also lectured on tax law and taxation at both the University of Pennsylvania and Villanova University and served as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School. Jerome Kurtz died from complications of surgery in New York City on February 27, 2015, at the age of 83. He was survived by his two daughters, Maddie Kurtz and Nettie Kurtz Greenstein. His late wife, Elaine Kahn Kurtz, whom he had been married to for 47 years, died in 2003.

In 2018, the business achieved authorisation from the Financial Conduct Authority and launched their Innovative Finance ISA. As of January 2019, The House Crowd had funded 368 properties, raised over ¬£93 million and paid investors returns in excess of ¬£38 million. History 2011-2015 \\"Buy- To-Let\\" Property Crowdfunding The House Crowd was set up in the UK in December 2011 and began trading in March 2012 and was one of the first UK property crowdfunding companies. It was launched at a time when, as The Guardian explains, ‚Äòyoung professionals hoping to get a foot on the property ladder and people in their 40s or 50s hoping to fund their retirement through buy-to-let investments have had their plans thwarted by booming house prices.‚Äô By June 2014, The Guardian reported that The House Crowd was buying ‚Äòan average of one [property] a week.‚Äô An article two days later by the same publication concluded that ‚Äòthe phenomenon of crowdfunding is booming.‚Äô The following month, the Daily Express reported that ‚Äò[The House Crowd] has spent ¬£5 million buying and refurbishing 69 properties in the Manchester area.‚Äô 2015- Peer to Peer Lending, Property Development Lending and FCA Regulation In 2015, The House Crowd began to offer peer to peer lending products on their platform. In 2016, the business began to use their crowdfunding platform to fund new property developments. In April 2018, The House Crowd raised just over ¬£1.3 million on their platform in a single day. ¬£1.2m of the funds raised were channelled into the Egyptian Mill Development of 41 houses and 15 apartments in Lees, Greater Manchester. In January 2018, The House Crowd announced that it had 'received full authorisation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to operate as a peer-to-peer firm.' In March 2018, the business launched an Innovative Finance ISA, where money is invested in peer-to-peer loans and property development investments, with The House Crowd spreading capital over what the company calls 'a diverse portfolio of property loans as far as practicable.' Business model Through crowdfunding, The House Crowd gives like minded investors the opportunity to pool their collective capital to fund a variety of investment loans. The House Crowd have several different investment types: Secured Peer To Peer Lending This product offers investors the chance to directly lend money to property owners. It‚Äôs a short-term commitment, the minimum level of investment is ¬£1,000, and all funds are secured against the borrower‚Äôs land and property. Average returns of 9.2% p.a. Property Development Investment This product involves financing new build housing projects. As with peer to peer property lending, investments are secured against the developer‚Äôs land and property. With this form of funding, investors can expect up to 10% interest over a relatively short loan period. Auto-Invest Offers the opportunity to profit from peer to peer lending without managing an investment portfolio at all. Just deposit the funds. Investments are across secured property development loans and bridging loans. IF ISA Allows investors to invest up to ¬£20,000 a year and earn a rate of 7% P.A. tax-free. Investment is diversified across a range of loans (mitigating your risk) all secured against property. Risk and regulation The House Crowd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. As managing director Frazer Fearnhead explained to the BBC, ‚Äòpeople's investment is protected by the bricks and mortar value of the property and if you want your money back you either need to wait for the property to be sold or sell your share to another investor. We cannot guarantee you will be able to find a buyer but everyone who has wanted to sell so far has managed to do so within a few days.‚Äô Returns As Money Observer explains, an investor has two options ‚Äòa fixed income-type product promising to pay between 7.5 and 10 per cent per year, [or] an equity set-up whereby investors take three-quarters of net profits.‚Äô Dragon's Den CEO Frazer Fearnhead appeared on Episode 1 of Season 13 of Dragon's Den, asking for a ¬£1 000 000 for 5% equity in The House Crowd. He failed to secure any investors.https://www.estateagenttoday.co.uk/breaking-news/2015/7/tv-dragons- demolish-property-crowd-fund-guru Sarah Willingham stated that Fearnhead's pitch was \\"the most disrespectful pitch from an individual\\" and that she was \\"offended\\". In an interview for Virgin Start Ups Fearnhead stated that the business subsequently used their crowdfunding platform to secure the investment they needed.

It runs between Pacific Avenue and Washington Street, beginning at Arguello Boulevard to the south of the Presidio Golf Course and ending at Drumm Street, to the west of Pier 3, near Sydney G. Walton Square. History In the fall of 1863, Mohave chief Irataba created a storm when he walked down Jackson Street, dressed in what Arthur Woodward described as \\"the full civilized costume\\" typical of European Americans, which Irataba soon preferred to traditional Mohave clothing. The press documented his every movement and wrote extensively about his physical size and strong features. In February 1894, the two cable car lines on the street were extended. In the 1990s, the Jackson Street Boys criminal gang gained notoriety. The section of Jackson Street between Montgomery and Sandsome Avenues is of historical interest. It contains several 19th century buildings that were built after the 1851 city fire and survived the 1906 earthquake. The Lucas, Turner & Co. Bank, also known as the \\"Sherman's Bank\\" was opened by William Tecumseh Sherman on the corner of Jackson and Montgomery in 1854. Ghirardelli Chocolate operated a factory in Nos. 415-431 between 1853 and 1894. The Hotaling Whiskey Warehouse, at Nos. 451-455, was built in 1866. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the Army decided not to demolish the buildings on this block for fear of detonating the barrels of whiskey in the warehouse, which would cause an explosion. The Hotaling Building at 466 Jackson Street was built in 1866. Notable landmarks Whittier Mansion, 2090 Jackson Street Notable buildings along the road from east to west include the Eureka Theatre, International Hotel Manilatown Center, Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, the San Francisco Chinese Hospital, Han Palace Antique and Art Center, Jackson Market, the German Consulate, Jackson Court, the San Francisco Public Montessori, Calvary Presbyterian Church, Whittier Mansion and San Francisco University High School.

It was released on August 1, 1990 by Som Livre. It was the fifth album in the series Xou de Xuxa. The best-known songs from this album are \\"Pinel Por Voc√™\\", \\"Trem Fantasma\\" and mainly \\"Lua de Cristal\\". The album sold more than 1 million copies, receiving diamond certification by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD).  Production  In Xuxa 5, it is possible to notice a certain maturation of the production of the Xuxa albums. Without leaving aside what the public liked in the other four previous albums of the series Xou da Xuxa, the album brings influences of other rhythms like lambada that was the great fashion of the time. There were 20 songs recorded for the album, but only 13 were chosen for the tracklist. Among those discarded was the \\"Direito dos Baixinhos\\", which was sung in the Xuxa Xou's special XV. \\"Lua de Cristal\\", the biggest hit on the album and the second largest in Xuxa's career, was composed primarily as the theme song for the film. Xuxa liked it so much that she decided to include it in the album. \\"Pinel Por Voc√™\\", another highlight track, was the last composition of Cid Guerrero for Xuxa that became hit. The Children's Queen always worried about passing messages on her records, she wanted children to learn something by listening to her songs. In \\"Cobra, Chap√©u e Palito\\", the singer teaches the difference between accents. Already in \\"Leitura\\", as its title says, was composed to encourage children to read more books. In addition to \\"O Boto Rosa\\" that talks about nature. Xuxa 5 was produced in partnership with the double Michael Sullivan and Paulo Massadas, with artistic coordination Max Pierre and Aramis Barros. It was recorded in the studios of Som Livre.  Release and reception  Xuxa 5 was released on August 1, 1990 by Som Livre in CD, cassette and LP formats. The album reaching rapid popularity thanks to \\"Lua de Cristal\\" song recorded by Xuxa, and theme eponymous film released together. In 1991, the album was released in Argentina on tape, but without authorization, being a bootleg. \\"Lua de Cristal\\" reached #1 in the official parade of Brazil, and its Spanish language version reached 35 position in the Top Latin Pop Songs Chart of Billboard, staying for seven consecutive weeks. With only LP Xuxa 5 sales and their first album in Spanish, the host earned 2.7 million dollars in an interval of two years, according to the Brazilian magazine Veja. The album sold more than 1 million copies in Brazil, being certified platinum by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). Xuxa 5 was re-released in 1995 and 1996 on K7 and CD, in 2006 on CD re-released in celebration of Xuxa's 20 years on Globo Network. Has the same catalog number from the other versions, but different barcode and art. In 2013 was relaunched by Som Livre in partnership with Xuxa Produ√ß√µes. The disc is part of the collection box Xou da Xuxa. Promotion Almost all the songs on the album were performed on the program, but \\"Lua de Cristal\\", \\"Pinel Por Voc√™\\" and \\"Trem Fantasma\\" were the most worked. Only three songs from the album have garnered music videos in their release phase. \\"Pinel Por Voc√™\\" a video screened by Fant√°stico (Fantastic), \\"O Boto Rosa\\" a video shown in Xou da Xuxa and \\"Lua de Cristal\\", two videos: one in the Christmas special of 1990 and another in the program.

His books Fertility Farming, Fertility Pastures, and Herdsmanship are regarded as classics of practical organic husbandry.. Note from the publisher, F. Walters, to Newman Turner Fertility Farming revised edition. Early life Frank Newman Turner was born in Worsborough near Barnsley, the eldest of five children of Frank Bocking Turner and Mary (n√©e Clayton), Yorkshire tenant farmers. He studied at Leeds University, where he earned his colours in boxing and rugby, and graduated with a National Diploma in Agriculture (NDA) and then a National Diploma in Dairying (NDD) from the University of Glasgow. After managerial positions on farms in Yorkshire, East Anglia, and Wales, he moved to London to work as an advisor for cattle feed suppliers and later joined the Potato Marketing Board. While in London, he began his journalistic career, contributing regularly to Farmers Weekly, The Dairy Farmer, and other agricultural periodicals. He also became active in the Peace Movement after attending lectures by Canon Dick Sheppard who founded the Peace Pledge Union in 1934. Newman Turner later became chairman of the Golders Green branch of the PPU. It was here that he met Hugh J. Schonfield who invited him to become vice president of his newly formed Society for the Creation of a Holy Nation, later renamed Commonwealth of World Citizens. Newman Turner registered as a conscientious objector (CO) in 1940 and became the manager of Goosegreen Farm, near Bridgwater in Somerset, which was run by a group of pacifists and Quakers as a training centre for COs who were required to work on the land. Organic farming Inspired by the work of Sir Albert Howard, whose books An Agricultural Testament (1943) and Farming and Gardening for Health and Disease (1945) advocated composting, he restored the health of the rather run-down farm and its ailing livestock by the use of deep rooting herbal leys, fasting, and botanic remedies. After the war, he bought Goosegreen Farm and, in 1946, launched a quarterly magazine, The Farmer - a journal of organic farming and natural living 'published and edited from the farm'. He also established the Institute of Organic Husbandry which held a series of weekend courses on organic farming and gardening and attracted visitors from as far afield as North America, Australia, and India. Visitors to Goosegreen Farm included the author and organic farmer, Robert Henriques, Fyfe Robertson, of Picture Post, Lady Eve Balfour, founder of the Soil Association, Laurence Easterbrook, Juliette de Ba√Øracli Levy, Doris Grant, author of Your Daily Bread, and writers and artists such as Elspeth Huxley, Reginald Reynolds, and Ethel Mannin, as well as Richard de la Mare, the agricultural editor of the publisher Faber & Faber which later published Newman Turner's books. Henriques and Grant were also among the trustees of the Producer Consumer Whole Food Society which was founded and sponsored by The Farmer to put growers and consumers of organic produce in touch with each other.The Farmer, Winter 1946, p. 45 Newman Turner also served on the council of The Soil Association.Conford, P. (2001) The Origins of the Organic Movement. Edinburgh, Floris Books,p.90 Writing and publishing Before Sir Albert Howard died in 1947, he had urged Newman Turner to write about his experiences in restoring the farm and building a herd of prize-winning pedigree Jersey cattle. However, Newman Turner was keen to accumulate even more practical evidence and it was not until 1951 that Faber & Faber published Fertility Farming. This was followed by Herdsmanship (1953) and Fertility Pastures (1955). In 1950 he had published a booklet under The Farmer imprint, \\"Cure your own Cattle\\". After an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK beginning around Jan-Feb 1951,London Gazette, 13 February 1951, p. 802 he offered to take infected cattle into his herd to demonstrate that animals fed on organic pasture would have immunity to the disease or recover with natural treatment.Newman Turner, F. (1952). Foot and Mouth Disease - Its Prevention and Cure. A Challenge. London: Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society. The Ministry of Agriculture rejected this challenge. Newman Turner was in demand as a spokesman on natural farming and animal rearing, appearing regularly on regional radio stations and, for a time, on BBC television's The Smokey Club, a pet care programme presented by the zoologist George Cansdale. He is also known to have been one of many notable figures sketched or painted by the portraitist, Elva Blacker.Exhibition catalogue of artist Elva Blacker with details of a Newman Turner portrait Human health In 1953 Newman Turner and his family sold Goosegreen Farm and moved to the Ferne Estate, near Shaftesbury on the borders of Dorset and Wiltshire, to run the home farm on organic lines. Ferne had been the home of the Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, who had set up an animal sanctuary there. His hope had been to establish an animal hospital using natural methods of treatment but this did not work out, owing to objections to him publishing from the Ferne estate.The Farmer, Autumn 1956, p12 Having by now qualified as a medical herbalist in the human field and consulted at the Society of Herbalists' Culpeper shops, founded by Hilda Leyel (Mrs C. F. Lyel) in London, Oxford, and Harrogate, he decided to sell his pedigree Jersey herd and focus on publishing and human health. In 1958 the family moved to Letchworth Garden City where he established a practice in osteopathy, naturopathy and medical herbalism. After Frank's demise, his eldest son Roger took over the clinic and ran it until his own retirement in January 2016. The Farmer had featured a supplement on organic horticulture and, in 1957, Newman Turner launched The Gardener, Small Livestock and Pet Owner as a monthly magazine with eminent horticulturist W. E. Shewell-Cooper, as associate editor, and Lawrence D. Hills a regular contributor. Lawrence Hills, a well known alpinist and horticultural writer, founded the Henry Doubleday Research Association (now Garden Organic) in 1954 and invited Newman Turner to become its first president, a position he held until his death. He had also taken on publication of the magazine of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists which he relaunched as Fitness and Health from Herbs. In 1962 he was made a Fellow of the Institute for his work on behalf of herbal medicine. In the early 1950s Newman Turner set up a company in Bridgwater, Organic Herbal Products, to supply natural pet foods and herbal remedies and, in 1962, with his wife, Lorna, Inter-Medics Ltd. a company importing herbal medicines and health food products from Germany and Switzerland. Neither of these is still operating. He died of a heart attack while visiting herbal suppliers in Bingen, Germany on 28 June 1964. Bibliography * *Fertility Farming (1951). London, Faber & Faber Ltd.

P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999 was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in the summer of 1937 from Coastal Defence units and had four battalions, the 889, 890, 891 and 892. This unit lasted until the end of the war. History The 223rd Mixed Brigade was established in August 1937 in Cartagena with Coastal Defence (Defensa de Costas) battalions as a military reserve unit for the Andalusian Army (Ej√©rcito de Andaluc√≠a). The command of the unit was initially entrusted to the commander of the Regimiento de Infanteria Sevilla 34, an infantry unit of the Spanish Republican Army based in Cartagena, but this regiment was disbanded as a result of the reorganization of the Republican Armed ForcesCartagena - Regimientos de 1900 a 1996 and its troops were integrated into newly established mixed brigades, following which the command of the 223rd Mixed Brigade went to Militia Major Ram√≥n Garsaball L√≥pez who would be its leader until only a month before the surrender of the Republican Military. =First phase: Cartagena and the Eastern Front= Although in April 1938 the 223rd Mixed Brigade was placed under the 64th Division of the XIX Army Corps of the Eastern Army (Ej√©rcito de Levante), the unit was still garrisoned in Cartagena. In July the same year the brigade was found out by the Military Investigation Service (SIM) in Cartagena to have been infiltrated by fifth column elements, following which it was sent to the Eastern Front line where there were numerous desertions among the hidden fifth-columnists that had caused the punishment of the brigade.√Ångel Bahamonde Magro & Javier Cervera Gil, As√≠ termin√≥ la Guerra de Espa√±a, Marcial Pons, Ediciones de Historia, p. 427 In the front the brigade was placed under the 10th Division of the XXI Army Corps, also belonging to the Eastern Army. The 223rd Mixed Brigade first fought in the Defensive Belt of Valencia (Cintur√≥n Defensivo de Valencia), becoming later part of the Eastern Army reserve. Between 7 and 10 November the unit took part in the failed assault to dislodge the rebels from Nules and Castell√≥n. =Extremaduran Front and end of the brigade= The 223rd Mixed Brigade was then transferred to the Battle of Valsequillo, where on 7 January it attacked the Cerro Mulva and the Sierra de los Santos in protracted combats that lasted about week. In February it returned to its garrison in Cartagena where it took again the Coastal Defence duty. In March 1939, during Segismundo Casado's coup against Prime Minister Juan Negr√≠n the 223rd Mixed Brigade stood against the coup, following which its commander was deposed and Militia Major √Ångel Mu√±oz took the command. Shortly thereafter the Republican Armed Forces surrendered and the unit was disbanded.

It is approximately long and flows through Hanover Township and Nanticoke. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek has one named tributary, which is known as Espy Run. Nanticoke Creek impaired by pH and metals due to abandoned mine drainage. Abandoned mine drainage discharges in the creek's watershed include the Truesdale Mine Discharge and the Askam Borehole. The creek is located in the Northern Middle Anthracite Field and is in the Anthracite Valley Section of the ridge and valley physiographic province. The main rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Group, and the Llewellyn Formation. The surficial geology consists of coal dumps, surface mining land, alluvium, Wisconsinan Outwash, Wisconsinan Till, urban land, and bedrock. The watershed of Nanticoke Creek is mainly forested, but urban land and mining land are also present. The city of Nanticoke is partially in the watershed and many unincorporated communities are there as well. The creek is named after the Nanticoke tribe, but was historically known as Muddy Run before appearing on maps with its present name by 1776. Extensive mining, both underground and on the surface, has been done in the creek's watershed. Numerous passive and active treatment systems have been installed in the watershed in recent times. Nanticoke Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. However, it is relatively lacking in aquatic life. Course Nanticoke Creek looking downstream Nanticoke Creek begins in a valley on Penobscot Mountain in Hanover Township. It flows west for a short distance before turning north- northwest and passing through the Weller Gap. The creek then leaves behind the mountain and turns north for a few tenths of a mile before turning west- northwest, briefly passing through Nanticoke before reentering Hanover Township. It then turns north-northwest for nearly a mile, crossing Pennsylvania Route 29/US Route 11/South Cross Valley Expressway and passing by the community of Loomis Park. The creek then turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west and crossing the South Cross Valley Expressway again. After this, it turns northwest again for a few tenths of a mile before receiving Espy Run, its only named tributary, from the left. It then crosses the Sans Souci Parkway and turns northwest for a few tenth of a mile, crossing the South Cross Valley Expressway once more before reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Nanticoke Creek joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. =Tributaries= In addition to having several unnamed tributaries, Nanticoke Creek has one named tributary, which is known as Espy Run. Espy Run joins Nanticoke Creek upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . An unofficially named tributary known as Leuders Creek is also in the watershed. Hydrology Nanticoke Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired, meaning that it fails to attain water quality standards. The causes of impairment are metals and pH and the probable source is abandoned mine drainage. The creek is also impacted by abandoned mine lands in its watershed. However, a total maximum daily load is not planned. The upper reaches of the creek do not experience any major pollution. Nanticoke Creek loses water to mines and also receives abandoned mine drainage discharges from them. The Truesdale Mine Discharge, which is also known as the Dundee Outfall, discharges into the creek. In low-flow conditions, its flow ranges from 0 to 38 cubic feet per second. A smaller abandoned mine drainage discharge with a discharge of 0.01 to 0.06 cubic feet per second also discharges into the creek. It has a substantial concentration of dissolved aluminum, but low levels of dissolved oxygen. The discharge of Nanticoke Creek downstream of the Truesdale Mine Discharge ranges from 0.019 to 40 cubic feet per second, with a mean of 6.3 cubic feet per second. The discharge of the creek at its mouth was measured to be 3.8 cubic feet per second in June 1999 and 8.2 cubic feet per second in October 1999. Both values were significantly lower than those of the nearby Newport Creek. In June 1999, the pH of Nanticoke Creek downstream of the Truesdale Mine Discharge was 6.8 and in October 1999, it was 6.4. At the creek's mouth, the pH was 6.8 in October 1999. The net alkalinity concentration was 40.0 milligrams per liter at the mine discharge in June, 3.70 milligrams per liter at the discharge in October, and 18.0 milligrams per liter at the mouth in October. During the 1970s, the acidity concentration of the creek's waters ranged from 18 to 365 parts per million on the main stem. The alkalinity concentration ranged from 0 to 3 parts per million. The specific conductance of the creek below the mine discharge was 1380 micro- siemens per centimeter in June 1999 and 1430 micro-siemens per centimeter in October. The specific conductance at the creek's mouth was 1390 micro-siemens per centimeter in October. In June 1999, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in Nanticoke Creek downstream of the Truesdale Mine Discharge was measured to be 9.4 milligrams per liter. In October of the same year, the concentration of dissolved oxygen at the creek's mouth was 8.9 milligrams per liter. The chloride concentration of the creek at the Truesdale Mine Discharge was 19.0 milligrams per liter in June 1999 and 720 in October 1999. It was 22.0 milligrams per liter at the mouth in October 1999. The sulfate concentration of the creek at the Truesdale Mine Discharge was 690 milligrams per liter in June 1999 and 720 in October 1999. It was 690 milligrams per liter at the mouth in October 1999. The concentration of dissolved aluminum in the waters of Nanticoke Creek at the Truesdale Mine Discharge was 23.0 micrograms per liter in June 1999 and approximately 15.0 micrograms per liter in October 1999. The concentration at the creek's mouth in October 1999 was less than 15.0 micrograms per liter. The dissolved iron concentration in the creek at the Truesdale Mine Discharge was 37,000 micrograms per liter in June 1999 and approximately 43,000 micrograms per liter in October 1999. The concentration at the creek's mouth in October 1999 was 15,000 micrograms per liter. The dissolved manganese concentration at the mine discharge was 4900 micrograms per liter in June 1999 and approximately 5200 micrograms per liter in October 1999. The concentration at the creek's mouth in October 1999 was 4900 micrograms per liter. The combined load of the three metals was per day at the mine discharge in June, per day at the discharge in October, and per day at the mouth in October. There is some evidence of sewage contamination, including sewer odors and debris, in the lower reaches of Nanticoke Creek. The city of Nanticoke has a permit to discharge sewage into the creek. Four combined sewer overflows are present in the watershed. Orange sediment is deposited on the creek's streambed, indicating a high concentration of iron in the waters. Yellow boy is also present along the creek in some places and can be seen from South Cross Valley Expressway. The concentration of total dissolved solids in the creek is 622 milligrams per liter, higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency criterion for suitability for aquatic life. Geography, geology, and climate The elevation near the mouth of Nanticoke Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The watershed of Nanticoke Creek is mostly in the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. It is at the southwestern end of that coal basin. The creek is also at the southern end of the Anthracite Valley Section of the ridge and valley physiographic province. The Anthracite Valley Section is a crescent-shaped synclinal basin. The creek is located in the Wyoming Valley. The Lower Hanover Flats begin at its mouth. There are three headwater streams in the watershed, all of which are on a valley in a plateau above the Susquehanna River. Some of the upper mine pools in the South-East Mine Pool Complex underlie the creek's watershed. The main rock formations in and near the watershed of Nanticoke Creek include the Mauch Chunk Formation (which dates to Late Mississippian and Early Pennsylvanian times), the Pottsville Group (from Pennsylvanian times), and the Llewellyn Formation (also from Pennsylvanian times). The Lower Red Ash coal seam is present near the headwaters of the creek. Near its mouth, the surficial geology in the vicinity of Nanticoke Creek mainly consists of alluvium (which mainly consists of stratified silt, sand, and gravel, with some boulders), Wisconsinan Outwash (which contains stratified sand and gravel), and urban land (which is highly disrupted by cut and fill). Further upstream, the surficial geology mainly consists of coal dumps and surface mining land (both of which are rich in rick waste), as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The upper reaches of the creek mainly are around surficial geology consisting of surface mining land, bedrock, and Wisconsinan Till. Mountains such as Little Wilkes-Barre Mountain and Penobscot Mountain are partially in the watershed. The topography of the watershed features refuse piles, crop falls, and strip pits in numerous places due to past mining. Some parts of the creek are known to run dry at times. Some water from the watershed flows to the South Wilkes-Barre Boreholes, outside of the Nanticoke Creek watershed. A borehole known as the Askam Borehole discharges directly into Nanticoke Creek. It has a diameter of and was created in the early 1970s by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (then known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources). It was created to alleviate flooding from an underground mine pool. The discharge of the borehole is typically around 3500 gallons per minute, but can rise to twice that during heavy rain. In June 1999, the water temperature of Nanticoke Creek was downstream of the Truesdale Mine Discharge. In October of that year, the creek's water temperature was at the mine discharge and at its mouth. Watershed The watershed of Nanticoke Creek has an area of . The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Wilkes-Barre West. The watershed is in the central part of Luzerne County. Most of the watershed of Nanticoke Creek (67.3 percent) consists of forested land. Significantly less common are urban land and mining land, which make up 12.2 and 10.3 percent of the watershed's area. A total of 8.6 percent is grassland and 1.6 percent is wetlands. Much of the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, save for its upper reaches, have been heavily mined, both via strip mining and underground mining. Municipalities in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek include Loomis Park, Lower Askam, Hanover, Espy Gap, Truesdale Terrace, Witinski Villa, and Warrior Gap. The city of Wilkes-Barre is not far from the creek. A reservoir known as the Hanover Reservoir is located in the southwestern part of the watershed. There are also a number of silt ponds in the vicinity of the creek. The creek's mouth is half a mile to the east of Nanticoke Falls. History and etymology Nanticoke Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1182159. Nanticoke Creek, like the nearby Nanticoke city and Nanticoke Falls, is named for a group of Nanticoke People who for a time had a village in the Wyoming Valley before Europeans settled there. The creek was known as Muddy Run on some very early maps of the area. However, its current name was appearing on maps as early as 1776. The creek has also historically been referred to by many other names, including Lee's Creek, Miller's Creek, Robbins Creek, Bobbs Creek, Rummage Creek, and Warrior Run Creek. All of these names were described as erroneous in Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. A forge was constructed on Nanticoke Creek in 1778 by Mason F. Alden and John Alden. A log gristmill was also built in the area in the same year by a Mr. Chapman. The mill was heavily guarded in 1780. In 1793, there was a sawmill and gristmill on the creek. Mining has historically been done in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek. This has substantially altered the hydrology and topography of the watershed. The period during which the watershed was mined lasted more than 100 years. A flume made of concrete has been constructed in the watershed of the creek. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying State Route 2002 over Nanticoke Creek was built in 1955 and repaired in 1969. It is situated in Hanover Township and has a length of . A concrete culvert bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 29 over the creek was built in 1969. It is long and is also in Hanover Township. In the mid-1970s, studies indicated that active treatment would be the most suitable remedy for abandoned mine drainage in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, with hydrated lime being proposed as one possible treatment method. However, some small scale passive treatment has been attempted in the watershed. A 2008 paper estimated that the Nanticoke Creek Assessment and Restoration Project would cost $5,000,000. An active treatment project by the Earth Conservancy began in 2012, with the intent to repair damage caused by the Askam Borehole. The Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek during earth-moving activities involving filling in dangerous strip pits. The United States Army Corps of Engineers published a report on Nanticoke Creek in 2005. Biology The drainage basin of Nanticoke Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In the 1970s, the Operation Scarlift report for the creek noted that the creek was almost entirely devoid of aquatic life due to low water quality. However, the creek had potential for fish life. An artificial wetland known as the Espy Run Wetland is in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek. If all of the of mining land in the watershed were converted to forested land, the trees could sequester of carbon per year and of carbon could be stored by the time the trees become mature.

Byerly was a graduate of the University of Chicago, and before the outbreak of the Second World War worked as a journalist and schoolteacher. He was in Paris when Germany invaded France in 1940, but was permitted to leave to the United Kingdom as he was an American citizen. In April 1941, Byerly enlisted in the Canadian Army's Royal Canadian Corps of Signals.

While all individuals have longitudinal blue flecks on the dorsal surface of the body, as males become mature these flecks become more prominent, and their spots change from yellow to green and finally, once they reach full maturity, to blue. During spawning season, the color of blotches in males intensify, peaking at intensity during the midpoint of the season, which plays a role in courtship. This color change also suggests a change in their androgen levels.Kodric-Brown, A. (1998). Sexual dichromatism and temporary color changes in the reproduction of fishes.

Considering their long life at the young age of 4-5, both the females and males, grow rapidly, with the males showing slight change in color as they reach maturity. Before maturing, the early juveniles are thought to be residing in the crannies and deeper in the caves, which would protect them against predatory piscivorous fish species that exist nearby.Platell, M. E., Hesp, S. A., Cossington, S. M., Lek, E., Moore, S. E. & Potter, I. C. (2010). Influence of selected factors on the dietary compositions of three targeted and co-occurring temperate species of reef fishes: implications for food partitioning. Journal of Fish Biology 76, 1255‚Äì1276. As the juvenile individuals approach their mature size, they start moving around the reef. Typically, the male individuals are solitary, and come together with females during spawning season. = Sexual reproduction = The harlequin fish is gonochoristic, it has indeterminate fecundity. This species also exhibits batch spawning which corresponds with the individuals being widely dispersed and scarce.Hunter, J. R., Lo, N. C. H. & Leong, R. J. H. (1985). Batch fecundity in multiple spawning fishes.

It's unknown whether juveniles present bisexuality early in life, but if bisexuality is present, it's assumed that, some time before the individual reaches maturity, it disappears early in gonadal development. Unlike other gonochoristic members of Serranidae, O. dentex have small testes, which implies low sperm competition.Erisman, B. E., Craig, M. T. & Hastings, P. A. (2009).

The spawning season for O. dentex is through September to March, and it peaks during the period between November and January. Indeterminate fecundity over the long life span as well as its long-lasting spawning period play a key role in egg and larval survival. These factors guarantee that of the numerous eggs that were produced during the spawning season majority of them will be released at a time that's favorable for the egg and larval.McEvoy, L. A. & McEvoy, J. (1992). Multiple spawning in several commercial fish species and its consequences for fisheries management, cultivation and experimentation. Journal of Fish Biology 41, 125‚Äì136.  Ecology  Distribution and habitat = The harlequin fish is native to the temperate waters, and is found over the shallow rocky reefs and in caves located in the cool coast of South- Western Australian waters. It's believed that this reef-dwelling species has an important place in the ecology of its environment since it is a top predator, and is relatively common in the area. = Diet = The harlequin fish is a demersal piscivore, and feeds during daylight. Its mature individuals feed exclusively on fish, and their prey, which is selected for on the basis of their size rather than species, and include species of teleosts, like the Labridae and the Pempheridae. Because juveniles would be unable to ingest prey as large as fishes, its assumed that they feed on other species besides teleosts. It feeds intermittently and its dietary composition lacks seasonality. When this diurnally active species is looking for food, it usually will lie over hard structures and wait for a prey, and when the prey is within range it will dart forward to attack its prey. Its physical appearance as well as the anatomy of its protruding eyes help with its foraging success.Gerking, S. D. (1994). Feeding Ecology of Fish. London: Academic Press.Gibran, F. Z. (2007).

It was preserved as a memorial to Thomas Newcomen (d. 1729), inventor of the beam engine, who was born in Dartmouth. The engine is the world's oldest surviving steam engine.  The engine  The arch head and piston chain of the engine = Newcomen engines = Newcomen's first successful engine is considered to be the Dudley Castle engine of 1712. Newcomen engines were used for applications that required the raising of water, such as the draining of coal mines. These 'fire engines' became popular for mining and 104 were in use by 1733, eventually over two thousand of them were installed. = Re-use of old engines = Although a radical new invention at its time, the Newcomen design was later, ca. 1775, supplanted by improved engines to the designs of Smeaton or Watt. The original Newcomen engine was inefficient in its use of fuel and was often replaced by a more efficient engine to save on fuel costs. This led to an extensive trade in both upgrading older engines with newly invented features, and in trading older engines to less demanding sites as they were replaced. Older engines would often continue in colliery areas where coal was cheap. Engines of this period had a considerable cost in the manufacture of their cylinder, a difficult engineering problem for the day. Their timber beams, pumps and engine house were relatively cheap in comparison. When second-hand engines were traded to other sites, it is this cylinder that is most easily traced, with many working on several sites over their lifetime. The surviving engines of this period have mostly been moved from their original leading-edge sites to some quiet backwater, often pumping water into canals, where they languished with only intermittent use. This was often seasonal, pumping only being required during a dry summer, and so the heavy coal consumption of an early engine was acceptable. = Griff Colliery = The early history of this engine is unclear but it was built some time around the start of the 18th century. Newcomen constructed an engine for Griff Colliery Griff Colliery, near Nuneaton in 1714 \\"to draw water by the impellant force of fire\\". The first engine was to be capable of pumping 16,700 litres of water per hour from the mine, with a maximum depth of . This first engine was working by 1715. It had \\"a copper boiler, a brass steam barrel (cylinder) and piston, two pit barrels of pott metal (cast iron) and other pypes cisterns and appurtenances thereto belonging\\". The brass cylinder may have been in diameter and long. For this engine a patent premium of ¬£7 \\"payable on Saturday of each week\\" was due. Seeing how well the engine performed, the mine owners hoped to take over the maintenance of the engine, and its costs, with an option to build other engines under the terms of the patent. This was agreed, and the partners paid ¬£150 for the first six months with further payments of ¬£420 per year for each mine drained. A second engine was erected around 1719. The mine though was not as profitable as expected and the original partners surrendered their 29-year lease in 1720, after only 7 years. New owners had a third engine, the surviving Memorial Engine, erected in 1725. It is likely that this was a rebuilt version of the first engine, with the original brass cylinder replaced with a larger bore one of cast iron with a stroke of . The engine was capable of pumping at 12 strokes per minute, moving 68,200 litres of water every hour. The engine was not large, even for its time, and used a simple one-piece wooden beam, without additional struts or being made of multiple laminated timbers. It was also carried on a timber frame, rather than being house-built. Further investment followed in 1728 with a new boiler for one of the engines. The colliery was worked out though and produced little coal after 1728. The Savery patents were still in effect and operating two engines attracted premiums of ¬£300 per annum. The colliery closed over the next few years and the equipment was sold. In 1729 a spare brass cylinder was sold to Measham Colliery, probably that replaced when the Memorial Engine cylinder had been replaced with cast iron. The engines, one of which would become the Memorial Engine, were sold in 1731 to Henry Green of the Bedworth Coal Works, south of Griff, and one in 1734 to John Wise, bringing a close to mining at Griff. = Oakthorpe Colliery = Details of the engine's longest period of service, nearly a century, are uncertain. It seems to have been the later engine sold from Griff in 1734 to John Wise, who was the owner of Oakthorpe Colliery at Measham. Joseph Wilkes would later own the colliery, and its engines.  Rebuilding  A second rebuilding, or more, took place during this service. Following James Watt's production of the much-improved separate condenser for Newcomen engines there were a number of improvements that were often applied to existing engines. The most important of these was the 'pickle pot' condenser, a device with the advantages of the separate condenser yet avoiding, barely, the Watt patent. As Watt's patent for the separate condenser ran from 1769 to 1800, these patent-avoiding devices can often be dated to this period: after their invention by Watt, but before the Watt device could simply be copied directly. The Engine also shows evidence of a patched hole in the side of the cylinder, where the original Newcomen injection valve was removed. The pickle-pot condenser is an extension below the cylinder connected by a large diameter pipe. A jet condenser within this works in the same way as the separate Watt condenser. The Watt condenser is attached by a longer, narrow pipe to the cylinder. By claiming that the pickle pot was an 'extension' of the main cylinder, rather than a separate component, it avoided infringing the Watt patent. A requirement for this was also that the haystack boiler was moved away from its traditional Newcomen position, directly beneath the cylinder. This was an innovation described by John Curr in his The Coal Viewer & Engine Builder's Companion of 1797. Other developments applied to the Engine included plate chain to connect to the arch heads of the beam, rather than the earlier link chains. The Engine's valves were replaced with drop valves, operated by a rack and pinion driven from the arbor, worked by horns and tappets on the moving vertical plug rod. After pumping at the colliery until around 1821 the engine was in the ownership of a Jonathan Woodhouse. Probably due to replacement by a newer engine, as the colliery continued working, it was sold again. This time out of the coal industry, and to a canal = Coventry Canal = The Engine House at Hawkesbury Junction The Coventry Canal Company purchased the engine in 1821 and set it to work pumping water from a well to maintain levels in the canal. An engine house, still surviving, was built at the Hawkesbury Junction, Warwickshire in 1837. The engine has sometimes been known as the \\"Coventry Canal Engine\\", after this service. The engine stayed in intermittent service here until 1913, a second service of over ninety years.  Preservation  The engine was preserved in 1963 by the Newcomen Society, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the birth of Thomas Newcomen. It was moved to his birthplace in Dartmouth and re-erected in a new museum there, known as the Newcomen Engine House. This building, originally an electricity substation, also contains the Tourist Information Centre. The engine is now worked by modern hydraulics and may be seen moving in action.

The Cluster of Excellence started in 2007 as part of the Excellence Initiative of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. It is therefore funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). CliSAP conducts fundamental research on climate and climate change in the fields of natural, economic and social sciences.  Research  The scientists of CliSAP are carrying out research in three different areas: *A: Climate Dynamics and Variability *B: Climate Manifestations and Impacts *C: Climate Change and Social Dynamics Area A focuses on the scientific aspects of climatology: Variability and predictability, interactions between climate system components as well as the global and regional sea level rises are investigated. Furthermore, the climate system‚Äôs relation to the carbon cycle and the influence of external disturbances on the predictability of the climate system is examined. The target of area B is to learn more about the consequences of global warming in sensible regions. One aim is to analyze the impact of global warming on permafrost soils or to find out whether intensive land utilization has any effect on the climate. In area C the scientists concern themselves about social reactions and developments connected with anthropogenic climate change. For example, it is examined in which ways various agents deal with climate-related information. Also treated is whether climate change is among others responsible for poverty and violent conflicts. CliSAP‚Äôs key research areas are supplemented with so-called ‚ÄúIntegrated Activities‚Äù like the Integrated Climate Data Center, Integrated Modeling Activities, Global Climate Reconstruction, Understanding Science in Interaction and Visualization.  Organization and funding  CliSAP is represented by a chair, currently Professor Anita Engels, and two deputy chairs, currently Professor Eva-Maria Pfeiffer and Professor Detlef Stammer. They are chosen by the Scientific Steering Committee, which sets the cluster‚Äôs strategic agenda. CliSAP was established during the first funding period of the federal Excellence Initiative of the German federal government and the federal states, 2007-2012. In summer 2012 the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) decided to continue the funding for another five years until 2017 within the second phase of the Excellence Initiative.  Education  The English-speaking graduate school ‚ÄúSchool of Integrated Climate System Sciences\\" (SICSS)http://www.clisap.de/grad- school/sicss/about-sicss/ is part of CliSAP. SICSS offers the possibility to earn a Master of Science degree within two-years, as well as a doctoral program which takes three years in the field of integrated climate system sciences. It combines climate sciences such as meteorology, oceanography and biogeochemistry in one course and, furthermore, integrates social and economic sciences as well as safety and conflict research. Every year CliSAP nominates outstanding doctoral theses in climate and Earth system research for the Wladimir Peter K√∂ppen Award. The award includes prize money of ‚Ç¨5,000.  Infrastructure  The following platforms of CliSAP partners are uses jointly for research: the supercomputers of the DKRZ, the Integrated Climate Data Center (access to climatically relevant satellite and in situ data), large equipment like the Hamburger Wettermast, and the Environmental Wind Tunnel Laboratory. The \\"Control Station German Research Vessels‚Äù organizes the running of the research vessels Meteor, Maria S. Merian and Sonne.

For many years it was the leading organization of the fragmented French pacifist movement. The APD believed that peace could be maintained through an internationally agreed legal framework, with mediation to resolve disputes. It did not support individual conscientious objection, which it thought was ineffective. It would not align with the left-wing \\"peace at all costs\\" groups, or with the right-wing groups that thought the League of Nations was all that was needed. Background Several pacifist organizations were active in France in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The French Society for Arbitration Between Nations (Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise pour l‚Äôarbitrage entre les nations) was founded by Fr√©d√©ric Passy (1822‚Äì1912), who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901. The International League for Peace and Freedom (LIPL: Ligue internationale de la paix et de la libert√©) was founded in Geneva in 1867 and was chaired by Charles Lemonnier (1860‚Äì1930). The LIPL was based in Switzerland until 1919, but had a Paris committee headed by √âmile Arnaud (1864‚Äì1921), who became president of the League in 1891. The League published a monthly journal, Les √âtats-Unis d‚ÄôEurope (The United States of Europe). Foundation Louis Barnier, who founded the organization, met the English Quaker and leader of the Wisbech Local Peace Society Priscilla Hannah Peckover (1833‚Äì1931) while he was a student in England. From the Quakers he became converted to the concept of peace through arbitration. On his return he shared this new faith with his teenage friends in N√Æmes. They formed a focus group called \\"The Wave\\" (la Gerbe). The association was founded on 7 April 1887 by six students led by Th√©odore Eug√®ne C√©sar Ruyssen (1868‚Äì1967). At first it was named the Association of Young Friends of Peace (Association des jeunes amis de la paix). It was Protestant in nature, influenced by utopian socialism and by the cooperative school of N√Æmes, which reflected the ideas of Charles Gide (1847‚Äì1932), Emmanuel de Boyve and Auguste Marie Fabre (1833‚Äì1922). Fabre was particularly influential on the young peace activists. Early years At first the association reflected the reforming Huguenot origins of most of the members, but soon developed more legalistic, internationalist and positivist views. The group denounced military service, and Barnier left France rather than accept enlistment, but eventually the others moved to a less radical position. In 1895 the association took the name of Peace Through Law Association (APD: Association de la paix par le droit). The APD stated that its purpose was to \\"study and popularize the juridicial solutions for international conflicts and particularly to gain support for this position by the activity of young persons without distinction of sex. The early members of the student group such as Charles Brunet and Jacques Dumas were in favor of founding a political party that would work towards pacifist goals. During the 1890s the APD became the dominant French peace association, replacing the Society for Arbitration. Starting in 1902 the French pacifist societies began to meet at a National Peace Congress, which often had several hundred attendees. However, they were unable to unify the pacifist forces apart from setting up a small Permanent Delegation of French Pacifist Societies in 1902, led by Charles Richet (1850‚Äì1935), with Lucien Le Foyer as Secretary-General. The 1902 Peace Conference was held in Monaco. The British Peace Society did not send representatives, since they considered the location \\"one of the blackest and most deadly moral plague spots in the whole world.\\" The feminist writer and teacher Jeanne M√©lin was influenced by the socialist and pacifist Jean Jaur√®s. From 1900 to 1914 M√©lin fought for a moderate pacifism based on arbitration of disputes as a member of the ADP. M√©lin, who also belonged to the Societ√© d'education pacifique, led the APD in the Auvergne. The association published the journal La Paix par le droit (Peace through Law) for over fifty years, disseminating intellectual and pacifist analysis of the international situation. There were 8,000 subscribers to La Paix par le droit in 1914, on the eve of World War I (1914‚Äì18). The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace provided support to the APD as well as to the Comit√© de conciliation internationale. In 1911 Th√©odore Ruyssen, president of the APD, issued a report that concluded that, \\"Any lasting solution to the problem of disarmament must be subordinated to achieving durable security through the construction of a juridical international system capable of pushing aside or resolving disputes between nations.\\" The report formed the basis for discussion by a national congress of French peace organizations that met on 5 June 1911 to consider what conditions were needed for international disarmament. On 28 July 1914 Austria declared war on Serbia, the opening move in the war. The APD sent urgent telegrams to the European chancelleries reminding them that under the Hague Conventions they had agreed to use arbibration before going to war, and put up posters throughout Paris calling for peaceful solutions to the issues. During World War I the association avoided defeatism, and took a position of \\"patriotic pacifism.\\" Despite this, the journal was often subject to censorship. In June 1915 the APD published a \\"minimum program\\" for building an international order after the war. It called for self-determination, the completion of the juridical project undertaken at the Hague peace conferences, and the constitution of a \\"society of peaceful nations committed to compulsory arbitration. Interwar period Th√©odore Ruyssen, long the leader of the APD After World War I the APD was unable to forgive the Germans and Austrians, whom they felt bore full responsibility for the war and had used brutal methods of waging war. The German pacifist Dr. Alfred Hermann Fried wrote in 1920 that he regretted that the victory of democracy had not resulted in a democratic peace, and that the Treaty of Versailles was radically anti-pacifist. Two months later Jules L. Puech, editor of the APD journal, wrote that he could not suddenly come to love the people whom he had been fighting. Th√©odore Ruyssen expressed similar views in 1922. By the early 1920s the association led the French pacifist movement, which remained highly fragmented. There were 5,000 subscribers to La Paix par le droit in 1920, rising to 8000 in 1924, then declining to 5,300 by 1935. In the 1920s the APD launched a second journal, Les Peuples unis (The United Peoples), aimed at a more popular readership. Every year the APD published a booklet titled Jeunesse et la paix du monde (Youth and World Peace) that was distributed worldwide. 108,000 copies of French version of the booklet were printed in 1933, and almost 250,000 copies in Dutch, Polish, English, Welsh, Esperanto, Chinese and Malay. Members of the association spread the message through public lectures and organized pacifist summer schools. At the 23rd International Peace Conference in Berlin in 1924 a growing divergence was evident between the moderate and intransigent camps of pacifists. The APD wanted to work towards a system of international law through which peace could be \\"organized\\", and felt that abstract and inflexible ideological statements damaged the cause. In 1925 the APD debated the question of conscientious objection, which it rejected in a heated debate as an unacceptable individual approach based on faith. This issue was a divisive topic throughout the 1920s. The APD did not think the problem of peace could be solved through a purely individual point of view, but did call for immediate definition of the status of conscientious objectors. During the 1930s the APD saw Adolf Hitler seize power, the 1932-33 World Disarmament Conference end in failure, France standing aside as Italy invaded Ethiopia and a resurgent Germany reoccupying the Rhineland. All these events showed that the legal edifice to preserve peace had failed. The APD during this period wanted to avoid interference in domestic politics or the affairs of other countries. It favored sanctions against Italy, but was against involvement in the Spanish Civil War for fear that it would escalate into an international conflict. The Communist-dominated World Committee Against War and Fascism was formed by the leaders of the Congress of Amsterdam in 1932 and the Congress of the Salle Pleyel in 1933. The APD would not cooperate with this \\"radical\\" organization or with the International League of Peace Fighters (Ligue internationale des combattants de la paix). In 1934, with the weakness of the League of Nations becoming clear, the APD rejected the idea of merging with other members of the French Federation for the League of Nations. It maintained its central position between the left-wing \\"peace at any price\\" school and the right-wing school that felt the League of Nations was the final goal of pacifism. In 1938, despite the growing tensions that would lead to World War II (1939‚Äì45), the APD remained convinced of its ideals and optimistic about a more peaceful future. The APD finally disappeared in 1948.

Clement became a canon at Llanthony at a young age, and was educated there. Having held the office of sub-prior, he became prior around 1150, and died sometime after 1167, although the year is not known. Clement's theological writings were mainly derivative and contain little original thought. Mostly they are collections of commentary on the Gospels, and include a gospel harmony. All except one remain unpublished. The harmony was popular in the later Middle Ages and survives in over 40 manuscripts. Life Clement was a native of Gloucester and became a canon of Llanthony Priory as a young child. He was a relative of Miles of Gloucester, the Earl of Hereford; he was perhaps a brother, but in some manner certainly a kinsman.Evans \\"Llanthony, Clement of\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Clement was educated at Llanthony and his learning was praised by Gerald of Wales and Osbert de Clare. There were a number of theologians working and writing at Llanthony while Clement was being educated and while he was working and writing. He held the office of sub-prior before his election as prior around 1150. (A non-contemporary note that Clement was elected in 1150 appears to depend on a now-lost marginal note in a later work and is not considered reliable.) Clement was the fifth prior of Llanthony and third prior of Llanthony Secunda, a dependent house of Llanthony. The two houses had the same priors from 1136 to 1205, with the prior having authority over both houses. Clement first appears at prior in a document dated 22 April 1152 and his last appearance dates to between 1167 and 1177.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 172 His time as prior was not considered exemplary, but he did institute some changes to the customs and practices of the house. Clement's cause of death is given as a stroke, but the year of his death is unknown. Works Clement wrote a number of theological works, some of which still survive. Surviving works include commentaries on Acts of the Apostles and the Catholic Epistles, as well as works entitled De tribus in paenitentia consideranda and Unum ex quatuor. The work De sex alis cherubin is also ascribed to him, but some confusion exists about it. Some of the English manuscripts of the De sex ascribe it to Clement, but the work has also been associated with Alain de Lille. It is possible that Alain used Clement's work and this led to the confusion. Works that did not survive include a commentary on the Book of Revelation, a commentary on the Augustinian Rule, a work titled Summa de dialectica et theologia, and possibly a commentary on the Gospels. This work, which was seen by John Leland, may have been confused by Leland with Clement's Unum instead. Another possible work, though one unlikely to have been authored by Clement, is Meditationes de beata Virgine. Clement has also been credited with a gloss on the Psalms, which has been shown to actually be the work of Gilbert de la Porr√©e.Sharpe Handlist of the Latin Writers pp. 86‚Äì89 The Unum, occasionally known as Concordia Quattuor Evangelistarum, is a gospel harmony to which Clement attached a large commentary. Unum became a standard text on the Gospels in both medieval England and on the continent. It was the basis for canons compiled in the 13th century by the first William of Nottingham to serve as the Franciscan Minister Provincial of England and revised in the 14th century by the second. It was also translated into Middle English under the title Oon of Foure, and was known to have been used by the Lollards in the 14th century. Clement's works were still being copied and disseminated in the 15th century.Burton Monastic and Religious Orders p. 202 Most of Clement's works were derivative, and did not contain much that was original thought. Instead, they comment on other works. Clement's commentary on his gospel harmony appears to have mainly compiled older writers' writings and contains little of his own thoughts on the Gospels,Hunt \\"English Learning\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society p. 27 although it appears that he did compile the Unum directly from the four gospels and not from previous harmonies. Smith \\"Clement of Llanthony's Gospel Harmony\\" Church History and Religious Culture p. 178 Most of Clement's works that survive remain unpublished. The only exception is part of Unum, which was partly published as a doctoral thesis in 1984.Smith \\"Clement of Llanthony's Gospel Harmony\\" Church History and Religious Culture p. 176 Most of Clement's works survive in one or two copies. Two works, De sex and Unum, have multiple copies. De sex survives in 12 manuscripts and Unum survives in at least 42 manuscripts, although in varied forms.

Built in 1894, the building included retail, performance, and residential spaces, and is a type of building that was once common and is now rare in rural Maine. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Island Falls Opera House is a large, roughly L-shaped wood frame building, which occupies a prominent lot overlooking a major intersection in the center of Island Falls. One leg of the L runs north-south, and is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a front-gable roof. The front facade has a projecting single- story section with a flat roof, behind which the second floor facade has a central Palladian-style three-part window at the center, and narrow windows flanking and in the gable above. On the side walls of this section there are three bays, most with narrow sash windows, then a repeat of the Palladian- style windows, which are topped by cross-gables at the roof line, and then additional bays with narrow sash windows. The rear section of the building has a gable roof running east-west and is 3-1/2 stories in height. The interior of the southern leg originally had a general store and the theater entrance on the ground floor. The store section still retains original wooden counters and shelving, while the theater lobby has the original ticket booth. The theater occupies most of the upper levels of the building, and includes original seating and wall decorations. The lower sections of the rear portion have a living area that has retained original woodwork, including a stairway with an elaborate newell post, and a decorative arch leading into the parlor. The hall was built in 1894 by Columbus Lamb Pettengill and his son on land purchased from W. W. Sewall, a major local landowner, whose deeds of sale disallowed the sale of alcohol. The performance venue was a major local entertainment space, and was adapted for the showing of motion pictures in the 1920s. The property now stands vacant.

It is born from agile manufacturing and project management, which is mostly used in manufacturing production, automotive and software developing teams.The Profitability of Agile Construction (2006) By (Parviz) Perry Daneshgari & Michelle T. Wilson.Z It is the application of the Toyota Production System to the construction industry, with two parallel paths: Measuring (ASTM E2691) ASTM E2691 - 11 Standard Practice for Job Productivity Measurement (JPM) - Active Standard ASTM E2691  Developed by Subcommittee: E06.81 Book of Standards Volume: 04.12 and improving productivity, as well as segregating and Externalizing Work through prefabrication and supply chain management. Like the Toyota Production System, Agile Construction principles form is a system that relies on input from the source of the work information, both up front for planning the project, as well as throughout the life of a project for real-time feedback. The real-time input produces real-time measurements of productivity and allows for improved responsiveness to changes on the jobsite. Iterative and incremental Agile Construction methods help manage the design and build of efficient, low-risk processes and activities. This means that each time a process is repeated some changes are made to improve the process. Changes for the better are kept and for the worse are discarded.

Based in Alexandria, Virginia, with a facility in Amman, Jordan, ACOR promotes the study of the MENA region, with an emphasis on the archaeology of Jordan. The institution is a member of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR) and the Council of American Overseas Research Centers (CAORC).  History  ACOR's lineage spans back to the foundation of the American School of Oriental Research in 1900, supporting the study of the MENA region. As the region changed during the mid-20th century, the foundation of a permanent research center for Americans working or studying in the Arab World needed, and in 1968 ACOR itself was created as \\"The American Research Center in Amman.\\" It was first directed by Rudolph H. Dornemann, followed by Murray B. Nicol. It became \\"The American Center of Oriental Research\\" in 1970. One of ACOR's first projects was excavating a Byzantine church in Swafiyeh, Amman, by the director and annual professor Bastiaan Van Elderen in partnership with Jordan's Department of Antiquities, also serving as a training course for students attending the University of Jordan. From June 7‚Äì13, 1970, Van Elderen and various residents barricaded themselves in the ACOR residence during fighting between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian army. Murray Nicol was appointed new director in 1970 but was prevented from serving by the second phase of the war in Jordan, so Siegfried H. Horn replaced him at the urging of the U.S. Embassy in Amman, followed by Henry O. Thompson. In 1975 George Mendenhall was director, followed by James A. Sauer from 1976-1981. In 1976 the building was remodeled, adding hostel accommodation for eight people and a 1,800-book library. In 1980 ACOR began partnership with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and was awarded a contract to write a five-year plan for archaeological development. In 1982 David McCreery became director, and ACOR began to grant fellowships. ACOR moved to a purpose-built building in 1986, with partial funding from USAID's office of American Schools and Hospitals Abroad and a ribbon-cutting ceremony by H.R.H. Prince Mohammed Bin Talal. In 1988 Bert de Vries took over as director, succeeded by Pierre Bikai in 1991, Barbara A. Porter in 2006, and Pearce Paul Creasman in 2020. Several longterm staff included cook Mohammed Adawi, born around in the Palestinian village of Zakariyya, who served as such for the duration of ACOR's existence and Librarian Carmen (Humi) Ayoubi, who managed the library from 1988 to 2020. As a member of ASOR, it has a strict policy of non-involvement in politics and follows their code of archaeological ethics. Notable ACOR Excavations  ACOR has led or been affiliated with many archaeological and restoration projects in the area, most notably: 'Ain Ghazal, Amman Citadel's Temple of Hercules, Ayla in Aqaba, Bab edh-Dhra, Hesban, Humeima, Khirbet Iskander, Madaba Archaeological Park Project, Pella, Petra Church Project, Petra Temple of the Winged Lions Cultural Resource Management, and Umm el-Jimal.  ACOR Photo Archive  In 2016, ACOR began a four-year project to digitize and preserve photographs of Jordan and surrounding areas. Photographs from six different private collections are part of the project donated by George Bass, Linda Jacobs, Rami Khouri, Robert Schick, Jane Taylor, and Charles Wilson. This project is available online at https://acor.digitalrelab.com/. ACOR Fellowships ACOR presents fellowships to students from Jordan, The United States, and other countries.

She was best known for her Emmy Award-winning work as a writer on the variety/sketch comedy program The Carol Burnett Show and for co-creating the television sitcoms It's a Living, The Facts of Life, and Mama's Family along with her writing partner Dick Clair.Obituary, hollywoodreporter.com; accessed March 14, 2015. Early life McMahon was born in Kansas City, Missouri. She later moved to New York City where she studied acting under Stella Adler. As an actress, she appeared on such television shows as Dennis the Menace, The Twilight Zone, Love, American Style, The Bob Newhart Show, and Welcome Back, Kotter. Television writing career Relocating to West Hollywood, McMahon opened a playhouse and was teaching acting when she met Dick Clair in 1961. Using the name McMahon (her mother's maiden name), she and Clair formed a comedy act similar to that of Nichols and May, playing nightclubs and eventually appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Merv Griffin Show and other television programs. The duo moved into television writing in the early 1970s, working on episodes of sitcoms such as The Bob Newhart Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show before joining the writing staff of The Carol Burnett Show in 1973. They remained with the show for six seasons, winning three Emmy Awards and receiving an additional six Emmy nominations in the process. The duo then moved on to write for Soap, for which they earned another Emmy nomination in 1981. McMahon and Clair contributed the story for the final first-season episode of the NBC sitcom Diff'rent Strokes, which served as the springboard for their series The Facts of Life. The latter series ran for nine seasons on NBC, making it one of the longest-running sitcoms of the 1980s. McMahon and Clair then co-created It's a Living with Stu Silver; this series aired on ABC for two seasons and in first-run syndication for another four. In 1983, McMahon and Clair created Mama's Family, based on a recurring series of comedy sketches they wrote for The Carol Burnett Show called \\"The Family.\\" McMahon and Clair also wrote for, and were producers on, the 1987 ABC comedy special Carol, Carl, Whoopi and Robin, for which Robin Williams won the first of his two Emmy Awards. Later life Following Clair's death in 1988, McMahon produced the short-lived sitcom Julie, starring Julie Andrews, before retiring from television.

The plot concerns a hijacking at London's Heathrow International Airport and the complications that occur trying to resolve the situation. Plot summary While on approach at London Heathrow Airport, a Boeing 707 begins experiencing engine trouble consistent with an engine fire. After a fraught landing, the plane is hijacked. The contingency plans for a hijacking are mobilized at the Home Office. Hilary Latymer is the 'Ratcatcher' who will negotiate with the terrorists and attempt to outwit them. During negotiations, the hijackers, led by a man named Packer, demand a prisoner held by the UK, one Shafiq Nasoud. Nasoud is currently being held at HM Prison Dartmoor, charged with attempting to smuggle firearms through Heathrow. It is ordered that Nasoud be brought to London in case it becomes necessary to hand him over to the terrorists. While ferrying him from Devon in a small airplane, the plane experiences engine trouble and crash lands. Nasoud manages to escape his jailers. Latymer's negotiations with the hijackers do not go well. He surmises from discussion with Packer that Packer is high on heroin. He also deduces from information provided by the American Federal Bureau of Investigation that a female hijacker, Joanne Fender, has a death wish and does not intend for the hijacking to be resolved non-violently. An attempt to take the plane ends in bloodshed. For most of the evening and night, Nasoud is able to elude a massive manhunt. He kills one British soldier and steals his rifle, and later holds a family hostage. After many close scrapes and several shootouts with the military, who have strict orders to take him alive, Nasoud steals a jeep. He is identified shortly after evading a roadblock, and pursued to a small farm. There, a soldier disables his jeep by shooting the engine block, but he drives into a stone wall and is killed. With Nasoud dead, Latymer has no options left. On the brink of paying a large bribe to the hijackers, he decides to pass off an imposter as Nasoud, simply to get the hostages released. In the course of the exchange, the imposter is found out, but not before the passengers disembark the plane safely. Gunfire is exchanged between hijackers and police, and meanwhile on the plane, Joanne Fender sets off a bomb, killing Packer and the flight crew, bringing an end to the incident.

He was a member of the 1935 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition, which was a preliminary to the full expedition of 1936 that attempted the summit. However in 1935 Bryant did not acclimatise well to altitude above , and so was not included in the party for 1936. He was a very accomplished ice climber, and was well-liked on expeditions. These two factors led, indirectly, to his compatriot Edmund Hillary becoming a member of the successful 1953 British Mount Everest expedition.  Teaching and New Zealand climbing  Born in 1905, Dan Bryant graduated at the University of Auckland in 1927 and his first job was at New Plymouth Boys' High School, near the Mount Egmont. He was a keen mountaineer and took parties of school pupils on expeditions on the mountain. After four years he moved to South Island and for 16 years taught at four other schools, all close to much higher mountains. At the same time he developed his own climbing skills, particularly concerning ice climbing. With his climbing partner Rod Syme on Mount Tasman in 1933, he pioneered an ice arete route now known as Syme's Ridge. With another partner Lud Mahan he was the first to reach the summit via an ice ridge that is now regarded as one of the most difficult routes up the mountain.  Europe  In 1934 he went to Europe and while attending the London School of Economics he did a great deal of solo climbing in the Alps. This let him meet other climbers and with whom he joined for expeditions. He discovered that his techniques on ice stood good comparison with European climbers, partly because he was used to worse weather conditions. With an American climber he met, Paul Petzoldt, he climbed the Matterhorn in four hours, descended on the Italian side in another four for lunch, and then reversed the traverse to Switzerland all in one day. He reported no problems with altitude.  Everest reconnaissance  Eric Shipton led the 1935 British Mount Everest reconnaissance accompanied by Bill Tilman and a small team on an \\"alpine- style\\" expedition. The purpose was not to reach the summit (indeed the remit specifically excluded that) but was to reconnoitre the North Col route in post-monsoon conditions and to carry out wider mountain exploration. On the recommendation of Colin G. (Ferdie) Crawford who had been on the 1922 and 1933 British Mount Everest expeditions, Bryant was invited to take part, so making him the first New Zealander to go on a Himalayan mountaineering expedition. After resigning from Palmerston North Boys' High School, Bryant sailed from Auckland to Bombay via Sydney and then went by train to Darjeeling where he joined up with the rest of the party. = March-in = They set off on 24 May 1935 and on the march-in the party was affected by altitude sickness, even at a height of while still in Sikkim, with Bryant particularly badly hit to the extent of vomiting. Shipton and Bryant were so ill that the march was delayed and they then needed extra mules to carry them personally. By 12 June they reached the Nyonno Ri range near Sar. These mountains were to be explored for the first time but Bryant, who had not been able to keep down any food or drink for two days reluctantly took his team's advice to trek back down to Sar where he recovered after a few days. Many of the rest of the party were themselves not at all well. On 17 June he set off again by himself and next day reached where he met one of his party's groups who were amazed to find him so well. The entire party, after recuperating at Sar, headed for the Everest region on 26 June. They reached the river Phung Chu where the bridge was a yak-hide rope from which a wooden frame was suspended for carrying people and loads. They found the frame was on the far side of the river and there was no rope attached. Bryant volunteered to cross by crawling along under the rope but the friction burnt his leg so badly he dropped off just before he reached the far side. However he reached the shore and attached a new rope to the frame. From there Bryant had to ride a pony because his leg was too painful for walking ‚Äì he would have been much safer on foot. Despite all this, Bryant kept up his spirits and also cheered up the rest of his party. In the evenings Tilman, who was normally extremely taciturn, would be \\"almost in hysetrics\\" listening to Bryants anecdotes about Shipton. = East Rongbuk Glacier = After Rongbuk Monastery Bryant became concerned he was again being affected by the altitude but he stayed with his colleagues in ascending the East Rongbuk Glacier which was a double march on foot to Camp I. The whole team were unwell with Shipton being the fittest. On 7 July, when the others went further up the glacier, Bryant had to recuperate at camp I and two days later he descended to Base Camp near Rongbuk where he found he had lost weight in three days. He left Rongbuk on 13 July feeling \\"really first class\\" and reached the foot of the North Col on 15 July, though he returned to Camp II where he met the others the next day. They had reached the North Col but the snow and weather had stopped them getting substantially further towards the summit. He joined Tilman and Edmund Wigram in attempting to climb the Khartaphu but he had to stop at an intermediate camp while the others tried unsuccessfully to reach the summit. The expedition doctor, Charles Warren, suggested to Bryant that his problem might be kidney disease or a congenital heart problem and advised seeing a consultant when he got home. With the entire party together again, Bryant's tent became the rendezvous with all seven squeezing into a two-man tent while anecdotes were told and plans and experiences discussed. Bryant's good humour and Shipton's ploy of splitting the party into varying small teams for different expeditions both contributed to people later remembering this as one of the most enjoyable expeditions they had ever been on. = West Rongbuk Glacier = On 3 August the party split for various expeditions with Bryant and Shipton heading up the West Rongbuk Glacier to make first ascents of Lingtren and its outliers and Lingtrennup. Bryant was no longer ill and was able to enjoy the expedition fully. They reached an unnamed col between Lingtren and Pumori on 9 August 1935 but, despite waiting several hours, mist prevented any view of the Cwm. They again reached the col on 11 August and on this occasion the mist cleared after many hours and they were able to get the first photograph to clearly show the Western Cwm with the Khumbu Icefall descending. Bryant wrote \\"A westerly spur of Nuptse curled round to the north thus squeezing the glacier of the upper basin into a narrow lip over which it poured in a gigantic ice-fall, a wild tumble of contorted ice, to the Khumbu Glacier 2,000 feet below. The cwm itself must be an amazing place, completely ringed in as it is, except for that narrow entrance, by a mountain wall nowhere less than 25,000 feet high.\\" Shipton said of the route up the Icefall and Cwm \\"it did not look impossible, and I should very much like to have the opportunity one day of exploring it\\". As they were finally descending Lingtren along a narrow ridge of ice they broke through a cornice and Bryant fell over . Fortunately, Shipton was able to hold the rope and Bryant, who had retained his ice axe, managed to climb back. = Changtse and return via Kharta = The entire party met up on at Rongbuk on 14 August from where they all attempted the Changtse but had to give up at because of snow, although Bryant had had to turn back earlier. They then headed back east, not going directly to Kharta but climbing a considerable number of mountains over during which Bryant had no altitude problems and had \\"never felt fitter\\". Counting over the entire expedition, they had climbed 26 peaks over (24 of them climbed for the first time) and Bryant had climbed 10 (8 for the first time). Beyond Kharta, on the trek back to Sikkim they reach a rope bridge where, for a bet, Bryant swam across the torrent. This amazed the Sherpas who, although very adept at wading (even when carrying the Europeans on their backs), had never seen or heard of anyone swimming. Bryant set sail from Calcutta to New Zealand, via Singapore, on 1 October. He wrote afterwards \\"These had been four and a half glorious months amid the grandest mountains in the world attempting work which must appeal to all mountaineers, working with men whose mountaineering ability was beyond all praise, and whose companionship is something to be treasured throughout life.\\" Bryant and Tilman had not acclimatised to altitudes above about , though Tilman had not suffered so badly. For this reason neither was included on the full-scale 1936 summit expedition. However, Tilman soon showed that any failure was not necessarily consistent ‚Äì in 1936 he led an expedition that reached the summit of Nanda Devi at which at that time was the highest summit ever reached.  Return to New Zealand  Bryant resumed teaching in the South Island and in 1938 made the first ascent of Mount Cook by its east ridge. That year he took a Carnegie Educational Fellowship at London University, returning to New Zealand teaching for most of World War II. He got married in 1941 and in 1946 was appointed head teacher at an Auckland high school. Although further from the mountains, he continued climbing and taking pupils on expeditions. He wrote a book New Zealanders and Everest, published in 1953. In 1957 Bryant was killed in a road traffic accident. In 1951 Shipton was appointed as leader of another reconnaissance of the Everest approaches, this time from Nepal. Remembering Bryant's climbing skills and good humour, which he ascribed to his New Zealand heritage, and hearing of Ed Hillary's success on his first Himalayan expedition, he invited Hillary to join the party. It was Hillary's success there that led to his inclusion in the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition. Foreword by Edmund Hillary.

History  ScS was established in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear in 1894, as a family owned home furnishings store. By the 1980s, there were eight ScS stores in the North East of England. In 1993, a management buy out enabled the business to expand out of the region, and become a prominent upholstered furniture retailer throughout the United Kingdom, with a focus on gaining presence in large retail parks. As part of the company's growth strategy, in 1997, the business was listed on the Official List and, as ScS Upholstery plc, was admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange‚Äôs main market for listed securities. Over the following ten years, the number of ScS stores grew to 95, supported by nine distribution centres. = 2007‚Äì2008: Impact of Economic Downturn = The ScS brand was adversely affected by the economic downturn in 2007 and 2008. Constraints on consumer lending and reduced disposable incomes saw a decrease in demand for ‚Äòbig-ticket‚Äô items such as large home furnishings, manifesting in trading difficulties for ScS and pressure upon financial resources. This was compounded by the withdrawal of credit insurance that had covered suppliers against ScS‚Äô debt to them, and in 2008, ScS collapsed into administration. In order to generate a significant cash investment, both immediate and long term, ScS was sold to Sun Capital Partners in July 2008. Under new ownership, ScS increased their share of the upholstered furniture market from 5% in 2009 to 7.9% in 2013. = 2011: Expansion of interest free credit = In 2011, ScS expanded their four years interest free credit offering to include all of their products.

Following its success, the concessions were rolled out at a further thirty six House of Fraser stores, under their ‚ÄòFor Living‚Äô brand during 2014. The House of Fraser For Living website was launched in September 2014. In November 2018, this arrangement was discontinued, due to House of Fraser going into administration.

Her multi-media artwork expresses human rights issues, especially those that affect Native American people today. Goshorn used different media to convey her message, including woven paper baskets, silversmithing, painting, and photography. She is best known for her baskets with Cherokee designs woven with archival paper reproductions of documents, maps, treaties, photographs and other materials that convey both the challenges and triumphs that Native Americans have experienced in the past and are still experiencing today. Early life Goshorn was born on July 3, 1957 and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. She found most of her artistic inspiration in her teenage years when she worked for a summer at her tribe's Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual cooperative in Cherokee, North Carolina. There, she became familiar with leading Eastern Band Cherokee artists and art forms. This experience led to a job with the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, where she helped organize Native art exhibitions and photographed the harvesting and preparation raw materials for Cherokee basket-making, carving, and other cultural art forms. After Goshorn graduated from college, the Department of the Interior's Indian Arts and Crafts Board commissioned her to illustrate 20 Cherokee basket patterns in pen and ink. These drawings taught her the math and rhythm of basket weaving and convinced her that she could weave a basket but she did not try until 2008, when she wove her first basket from paper splints. =Education= Goshorn attended the Cleveland Institute of Art in Ohio because of their silversmithing department. She was the only Native American student and did not find support in exploring Native American customary arts. Goshorn left the Cleveland Institute of Art and went to the Atlanta College of Art where she finished her Bachelor of Fine Arts. She found inspiration upon discovering American Indian Art Magazine and artists such as Fritz Scholder and T.C. Cannon. After these discoveries, Goshorn moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1981 to start her career. CollectionsBaskets= Goshorn has woven over 200 baskets since 2009. She has been identified by the Museum of the Cherokee Indian as the 14th living Eastern Band Cherokee to master the difficult double-weave technique. A few examples of her double- weave baskets include Sealed Fate (her first double weave), Educational Genocide, Reclaiming Our Power and Precious Holding. A few examples of her single-weave baskets include No Honor, 10 Little Indians, Prayers for Our Children, and Why We Dance. Goshorn also modeled some of her baskets after those that would have had specific uses in the tribal community. Examples include her Phishing Basket, modeled after a Southeastern Woodlands fishing basket, Cherokee Burden Basket, modeled after a basket that would have been used to carry wood, corn or other heavy burdens and Separating the Chaff, modeled after a sifting or winnowing basket. In her later work, Shan Goshorn experimented with novel shapes, moving more in a direction of sculpture. Hearts of Our Women was woven in a way to mimic the flames of a fire, The Fire Within was woven in the shape of the Cherokee seven-sided star, and Swept Away was woven as a three-dimensional representation of the weaving pattern called \\"Water.\\" Before her focus on baskets, Goshorn's work consisted largely of drawings, paintings, photography and hand-tinted photography. With her work, Goshorn presented historical and current issues with the portrayal of Native American people. Molly McGlennen writes of Goshorn's baskets that they \\"reveal Indigenous versions of history, which necessarily uncover ‚Äì rather than enshroud -- the chasms of division between Native and non-Native peoples.\\" =Honest Injun= Honest Injun is one of Goshorn's series that addresses human rights issues specific to Native Americans. She chose a multitude of hand-tinted, black-and-white images of brands that use Indian images and names to sell their product. This collection was made in response to America's quincentennial celebration of Christopher Columbus' discovery of the Americas. =Reclaiming Cultural Ownership; Challenging Indian Stereotypes= This collection consisted of 36 black-and-white documentary style images of Native American people living every day life. This series worked to challenge the way that Indian people are portrayed by the media. =Kituwah Motherland= This double-exposed, hand-tinted black-and-white photograph helped to raise awareness of Duke Power's plan to build a power plant overlooking the Kituwa mound, one of the most sacred locations to the Cherokee people.  Art career  Goshorn belonged to the art collective, the Urban Indian Five, along with Gerald Cournoyer (Oglala Lakota), Brent Greenwood (Chickasaw-Ponca), Thomas Poolaw (Kiowa), and Holly Wilson (Delaware Nation-Cherokee). The intertribal group of artists were interested in exploring art's ability to help Native people overcome historical trauma. They exhibited works in Indian Health Services facilities. Since her first double-weave work, Goshorn was awarded multiple fellowships and her work has been displayed in collections such as the National Museum of the American Indian (Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC), Gilcrease Museum (OK), Museum of Contemporary Native Arts (NM), CN Gorman Museum (UC Davis, CA), Minneapolis Institute of Art (MN), Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art(IN) and the Museum of the Cherokee Indian (NC). Goshorn received a 2013 Eiteljorg Contemporary Art Fellowship, 2013 Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship, 2013 SWAIA Discovery Fellowship, the 2014 Native Arts and Cultures Foundation Fellowship and the 2015 United States Artists Fellowship.  Death  Shan Goshorn died on December 1, 2018, from cancer at the age of 61. She is survived by her husband Tom Pendergraft; her mother, Edna Goshorn; two sisters; her son, Loma Pendergraft; daughter, Neosha Pendergraft; and three stepdaughters, Natalee, Carolee, and Sommer. After her death, SWAIA issued the statement: \\"The Native art world has lost a giant.

It opened on April 4, 1973, and was destroyed in 2001 during the September 11 attacks. At the time of their completion, the Twin Towers‚Äîthe original 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower), at ; and 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower), at ‚Äîwere the tallest buildings in the world. Other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC, and 7 WTC. The complex contained of office space. The core complex was built between 1966 and 1975, at a cost of $400 million (equivalent to $2.27 billion in 2018). During its existence, the World Trade Center experienced several major incidents, including a fire on , 1975, a bombing on , 1993, and a bank robbery on , 1998. In 1998, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey decided to privatize it by leasing the buildings to a private company to manage. It awarded the lease to Silverstein Properties in . On the morning of September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the Twin Towers within minutes of each other; two hours later, both towers collapsed. The attacks killed 2,606 people in and within the vicinity of the towers, as well as all 157 on board the two aircraft. Falling debris from the towers, combined with fires that the debris initiated in several surrounding buildings, led to the partial or complete collapse of all the buildings in the complex, and caused catastrophic damage to ten other large structures in the surrounding area. The cleanup and recovery process at the World Trade Center site took eight months, during which the remains of the other buildings were demolished. A new World Trade Center complex is being built with six new skyscrapers and several other buildings, many of which are complete. A memorial and museum to those killed in the attacks, a new rapid transit hub, and an elevated park have been opened. One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere at and the lead building for the new complex, was completed in November 2014. During its existence, the World Trade Center was an icon of New York City. It had a major role in popular culture and according to one estimate was depicted in 472 films. Following the World Trade Center's destruction, mentions of the complex were altered or deleted, and several dozen \\"memorial films\\" were created. Before the World Trade Center Radio Row in 1936, with the Cortlandt Street station in the background =Site= The western portion of the World Trade Center site was originally under the Hudson River. The shoreline was in the vicinity of Greenwich Street, which is closer to the site's eastern border. It was on this shoreline, close to the intersection of Greenwich and the former Dey Street, that Dutch explorer Adriaen Block's ship, Tyger, burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding him and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. They built the first European settlement in Manhattan. The remains of the ship were buried under landfill when the shoreline was extended beginning in 1797 and were discovered during excavation work in 1916. The remains of a second eighteenth century ship were discovered in 2010 during excavation work at the site. The ship, believed to be a Hudson River sloop, was found just south of where the Twin Towers stood, about below the surface. Later, the area became New York City's Radio Row, which existed from 1921 to 1966. The neighborhood was a warehouse district in what is now Tribeca and the Financial District. Harry Schneck opened City Radio on Cortlandt Street in 1921, and eventually the area held several blocks of electronics stores, with Cortlandt Street as its central axis. The used radios, war surplus electronics (e.g., AN/ARC-5 radios), junk, and parts were often piled so high they would spill out onto the street, attracting collectors and scroungers. According to a business writer, it also was the origin of the electronic component distribution business. =Establishment of World Trade Center= The idea of establishing a World Trade Center in New York City was first proposed in 1943. The New York State Legislature passed a bill authorizing New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey to begin developing plans for the project, but the plans were put on hold in 1949. During the late 1940s and 1950s, economic growth in New York City was concentrated in Midtown Manhattan. To help stimulate urban renewal in Lower Manhattan, David Rockefeller suggested that the Port Authority build a World Trade Center there. Plans for the use of eminent domain to remove the shops in Radio Row bounded by Vesey, Church, Liberty, and West Streets began in 1961 when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was deciding to build the world's first world trade center. They had two choices: the east side of Lower Manhattan, near the South Street Seaport; or the west side, near the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&M;) station, Hudson Terminal. Initial plans, made public in 1961, identified a site along the East River for the World Trade Center. As a bi-state agency, the Port Authority required approval for new projects from the governors of both New York and New Jersey. New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner objected to New York getting a $335 million project. Toward the end of 1961, negotiations with outgoing New Jersey Governor Meyner reached a stalemate. At the time, ridership on New Jersey's H&M; Railroad had declined substantially from a high of 113 million riders in 1927 to 26 million in 1958 after new automobile tunnels and bridges had opened across the Hudson River. In a meeting between Port Authority director Austin J. Tobin and newly elected New Jersey Governor Richard J. Hughes, the Port Authority offered to take over the H & M Railroad. They also decided to move the World Trade Center project to the Hudson Terminal building site on the west side of Lower Manhattan, a more convenient location for New Jersey commuters arriving via PATH. With the new location and the Port Authority's acquisition of the H&M; Railroad, New Jersey agreed to support the World Trade Center project. As part of the deal, the Port Authority renamed the H&M; \\"Port Authority Trans-Hudson\\", or PATH for short. To compensate Radio Row business owners for their displacement, the Port Authority gave each business $3,000, without regard to how long the business had been there or how prosperous it was. The Port Authority began purchasing properties in the area for the World Trade Center by March 1965, and demolition of Radio Row began in March 1966. It was completely demolished by the end of the year. Approval was also needed from New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the New York City Council. Disagreements with the city centered on tax issues. On , 1966, an agreement was reached whereby the Port Authority would make annual payments to the City in lieu of taxes for the portion of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants. In subsequent years, the payments would rise as the real estate tax rate increased. Design, construction, and criticismDesign= left On , 1962, the Port Authority announced the selection of Minoru Yamasaki as lead architect and Emery Roth & Sons as associate architects. Yamasaki devised the plan to incorporate twin towers. His original plan called for the towers to be 80 stories tall, but to meet the Port Authority's requirement for of office space, the buildings would each have to be 110 stories tall. Yamasaki's design for the World Trade Center, unveiled to the public on , 1964, called for a square plan approximately in dimension on each side. The buildings were designed with narrow office windows wide, which reflected Yamasaki's fear of heights as well as his desire to make building occupants feel secure. His design included building facades clad in aluminum- alloy. The World Trade Center was one of the most-striking American implementations of the architectural ethic of Le Corbusier and was the seminal expression of Yamasaki's gothic modernist tendencies. He was also inspired by Arabic architecture, elements of which he incorporated in the building's design, having previously designed Saudi Arabia's Dhahran International Airport with the Saudi Binladin Group. A typical floor layout and elevator arrangement of the WTC towers A major limiting factor in building height is the issue of elevators; the taller the building, the more elevators are needed to service it, requiring more space-consuming elevator banks. Yamasaki and the engineers decided to use a new system with two \\"sky lobbies\\"‚Äîfloors where people could switch from a large-capacity express elevator to a local elevator that goes to each floor in a section. This system, inspired by the local- express train operation used in New York City's subway system, allowed the design to stack local elevators within the same elevator shaft. Located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower, the sky lobbies enabled the elevators to be used efficiently. This increased the amount of usable space on each floor from 62 to 75 percent by reducing the number of elevator shafts. Altogether, the World Trade Center had 95 express and local elevators. The structural engineering firm Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson worked to implement Yamasaki's design, developing the framed-tube structural system used in the twin towers. The Port Authority's Engineering Department served as foundation engineers, Joseph R. Loring & Associates as electrical engineers, and Jaros, Baum & Bolles (JB&B;) as mechanical engineers. Tishman Realty & Construction Company was the general contractor on the World Trade Center project. Guy F. Tozzoli, director of the World Trade Department at the Port Authority, and Rino M. Monti, the Port Authority's Chief Engineer, oversaw the project. As an interstate agency, the Port Authority was not subject to the local laws and regulations of the City of New York, including building codes. Nonetheless, the World Trade Center's structural engineers ended up following draft versions of New York City's new 1968 building codes. The exterior structure of the Twin Towers The framed-tube design, introduced in the 1960s by Bangladeshi-American structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan, was a new approach that allowed more open floor plans than the traditional design that distributed columns throughout the interior to support building loads. Each of the World Trade Center towers had 236 high-strength, load-bearing perimeter steel columns which acted as Vierendeel trusses. The perimeter columns were spaced closely together to form a strong, rigid wall structure, supporting virtually all lateral loads such as wind loads, and sharing the gravity load with the core columns. The perimeter structure containing 59 columns per side was constructed with extensive use of prefabricated modular pieces, each consisting of three columns, three stories tall, connected by spandrel plates. The spandrel plates were welded to the columns to create the modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. Adjacent modules were bolted together with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them to work together in resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so that the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor. Below 7th floor to the foundation, there were fewer, wider-spaced perimeter columns to accommodate doorways. The core of the towers housed the elevator and utility shafts, restrooms, three stairwells, and other support spaces. The core of each tower was a rectangular area and contained 47 steel columns running from the bedrock to the top of the tower. The large, column-free space between the perimeter and core was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses. The floors supported their own weight as well as live loads, providing lateral stability to the exterior walls and distributing wind loads among the exterior walls. The floors consisted of thick lightweight concrete slabs laid on a fluted steel deck. A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors. The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns and were on 6 foot 8 inch (2.03 m) centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side. The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with viscoelastic dampers that helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants. Hat trusses (or \\"outrigger trusses\\") located from the 107th floor to the top of the buildings were designed to support a tall communication antenna on top of each building. Only 1 WTC (north tower) actually had an antenna fitted; it was added in 1978. The truss system consisted of six trusses along the long axis of the core and four along the short axis. This truss system allowed some load redistribution between the perimeter and core columns and supported the transmission tower. The framed- tube design, using steel core and perimeter columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material, created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more in response to the wind compared to traditional structures, such as the Empire State Building that have thick, heavy masonry for fireproofing of steel structural elements. During the design process, wind tunnel tests were done to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces. Experiments also were done to evaluate how much sway occupants could comfortably tolerate; however, many subjects experienced dizziness and other ill effects. One of the chief engineers Leslie Robertson worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop viscoelastic dampers to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns along with some other structural modifications, reduced the building sway to an acceptable level. =Construction= World Trade Center under construction in May 1971 In March 1965, the Port Authority began acquiring property at the World Trade Center site. Demolition work began on , 1966, to clear thirteen square blocks of low rise buildings in Radio Row for its construction. Groundbreaking for the construction of the World Trade Center took place on , 1966. The site of the World Trade Center was located on landfill with the bedrock located below. To construct the World Trade Center, it was necessary to build a \\"bathtub\\" with a slurry wall around the West Street side of the site, to keep water from the Hudson River out. The slurry method selected by the Port Authority's chief engineer, John M. Kyle, Jr., involved digging a trench, and as excavation proceeded, filling the space with a \\"slurry\\" mixture composed of bentonite and water, which plugged holes and kept groundwater out. When the trench was dug out, a steel cage was inserted and concrete was poured in, forcing the \\"slurry\\" out. It took fourteen months for the slurry wall to be completed. It was necessary before excavation of material from the interior of the site could begin. The of excavated material were used (along with other fill and dredge material) to expand the Manhattan shoreline across West Street to form Battery Park City. In January 1967, the Port Authority awarded $74 million in contracts to various steel suppliers. Construction work began on the North Tower in , and construction on the South Tower was under way by . The original Hudson Tubes, which carried PATH trains into Hudson Terminal, remained in service during the construction process until 1971, when a new station opened. The topping out ceremony of 1 WTC (North Tower) took place on , 1970, while 2 WTC's ceremony (South Tower) occurred on , 1971. Extensive use of prefabricated components helped to speed up the construction process, and the first tenants moved into the North Tower in , while it was still under construction, while the South Tower began accepting tenants in . When the World Trade Center twin towers were completed, the total costs to the Port Authority had reached $900 million. The ribbon cutting ceremony took place on , 1973. In addition to the twin towers, the plan for the World Trade Center complex included four other low-rise buildings, which were built in the early 1970s. The 47-story 7 World Trade Center building was added in the 1980s, to the north of the main complex. Altogether, the main World Trade Center complex occupied a superblock. =Criticism= The WTC site building arrangement Plans to build the World Trade Center were controversial. Its site was the location of Radio Row, home to hundreds of commercial and industrial tenants, property owners, small businesses, and approximately 100 residents, many of whom fiercely resisted forced relocation. A group of affected small businesses sought an injunction challenging the Port Authority's power of eminent domain. The case made its way through the court system to the United States Supreme Court; it refused to hear the case. Private real estate developers and members of the Real Estate Board of New York, led by Empire State Building owner Lawrence A. Wien, expressed concerns about this much \\"subsidized\\" office space going on the open market, competing with the private sector, when there was already a glut of vacancies. The World Trade Center itself was not rented out completely until after 1979 and then only because the complex's subsidy by the Port Authority made rents charged for its office space cheaper than those for comparable space in other buildings. Others questioned whether the Port Authority should have taken on a project described by some as a \\"mistaken social priority\\". The World Trade Center's design aesthetics attracted criticism from the American Institute of Architects and other groups. Lewis Mumford, author of The City in History and other works on urban planning, criticized the project, describing it and other new skyscrapers as \\"just glass-and-metal filing cabinets\\". The Twin Towers were described as looking similar to \\"the boxes that the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building came in\\". Many disliked the twin towers' narrow office windows, which were only wide and framed by pillars that restricted views on each side to narrow slots. Activist and sociologist Jane Jacobs argued the waterfront should be kept open for New Yorkers to enjoy. Some critics regarded the trade center's \\"superblock\\", replacing a more traditional, dense neighborhood, as an inhospitable environment that disrupted the complicated traffic network typical of Manhattan. For example, in his book The Pentagon of Power, Lewis Mumford denounced the center as an \\"example of the purposeless giantism and technological exhibitionism that are now eviscerating the living tissue of every great city\\". Complex Aerial view of the World Trade Center in 1997. Buildings are partially blocked by shadows The World Trade Center complex housed more than 430 companies that were engaged in various commercial activities. On a typical weekday, an estimated 50,000 people worked in the complex and another 140,000 passed through as visitors. The complex hosted of office space, and was so large that it had its own zip code: 10048. The towers offered expansive views from the observation deck atop the South Tower and the Windows on the World restaurant on top of the North Tower. The Twin Towers became known worldwide, appearing in numerous movies and television shows as well as on postcards and other merchandise. It became a New York icon, in the same league as the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Statue of Liberty. The World Trade Center was compared to Rockefeller Center, which David Rockefeller's brother Nelson Rockefeller had developed in midtown Manhattan. =North and South Towers= Lobby of the North Tower, looking south along the east side of the building, August 19, 2000 One World Trade Center and Two World Trade Center, commonly referred to as the Twin Towers, were designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans, uninterrupted by columns or walls. They were the main buildings of the World Trade Center. Construction of the North Tower at One World Trade Center began in 1966 with the South Tower at Two World Trade Center. When completed in 1972, 1 World Trade Center became the tallest building in the world for two years, surpassing the Empire State Building after its 40-year reign. The North Tower stood tall and featured a telecommunications antenna or mast that was built on the roof in 1978. With this addition, the highest point of the North Tower reached . Chicago's Sears Tower, finished in , reached at the rooftop. South Tower lobby interior, overlooking the elevator core and red carpet from the balcony, October 1988 When completed in 1973, the South Tower became the second tallest building in the world at . Its rooftop observation deck was high and its indoor observation deck was high. Each tower stood over high, and occupied about of the total of the site's land. During a press conference in 1973, Yamasaki was asked, \\"Why two 110-story buildings? Why not one 220-story building?\\" His tongue-in-cheek response was: \\"I didn't want to lose the human scale.\\" Throughout their existence, the twin towers had more floors (at 110) than any other building. Their floor counts were not matched until the construction of the Sears Tower, and they were not surpassed until the construction of the Burj Khalifa, which opened in 2010. Each tower had a total mass of around 500,000 tons. =Austin J. Tobin Plaza= The five-acre Austin J. Tobin Plaza, looking west toward the Marriott Hotel which was in 3 World Trade Center The original World Trade Center had a massive, five-acre plaza which all other buildings, including the Twin Towers centered around. In 1982, the immense plaza between the twin towers was renamed after the man who authorized the construction of the original World Trade Center. Port Authority's late chairman, Austin J. Tobin. During the summer, the Port Authority installed a portable stage, typically backed up against the North Tower within Tobin Plaza for performers. The odd layout for performances was due to the installation of a sculpture in the center of the plaza, which only allowed for about 6,000 fans. For many years, the Plaza was often beset by brisk winds at ground level owing to the Venturi effect between the two towers. Some gusts were so strong that pedestrians' travel had to be aided by ropes. In 1999, the outdoor plaza reopened after undergoing $12 million in renovations. This involved replacing marble pavers with gray and pink granite stones, adding new benches, planters, new restaurants, food kiosks and outdoor dining areas. =Top of the World observation deck= Visitors on the viewing platform on the South Tower's roof, looking north toward Midtown Manhattan in 1984 Although most of the space in the World Trade Center complex was off-limits to the public, the South Tower featured a public observation deck on the 107th floor called Top of the World. After paying an entrance fee, visitors were required to pass through security checks added after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. They were then sent to the 107th-floor indoor observatory at a height of by a dedicated express elevator. The exterior columns were narrowed to allow 28 inches of window width between them. The Port Authority renovated the observatory in 1995, then leased it to Ogden Entertainment to operate. Attractions added to the observation deck included a theater showing a film of a helicopter tour around the city. The 107th-floor food court was designed with a subway car theme and featured Sbarro and Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs. Weather permitting, visitors could ride two short escalators up from the 107th-floor viewing area to an outdoor platform at a height of . On a clear day, visitors could see up to . An anti-suicide fence was placed on the roof itself, with the viewing platform set back and elevated above it, requiring only an ordinary railing. This left the view unobstructed, unlike the observation deck of the Empire State Building. =Windows on the World restaurant= Windows on the World restaurant interior, November 4, 1999 Windows on the World, the restaurant on the North Tower's 106th and 107th floors, opened in . It was developed by restaurateur Joe Baum at a cost of more than $17 million. As well as the main restaurant, two offshoots were located at the top of the North Tower: Hors d'Oeuvrerie (offered a Danish smorgasbord during the day and sushi in the evening) and Cellar in the Sky (a small wine bar). Windows on the World also had a wine school program run by Kevin Zraly, who published a book on the course. Windows on the World was closed following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. When it reopened in 1996, the Greatest Bar on Earth and Wild Blue replaced the original restaurant offshoots. In 2000, its last full year of operation, Windows on the World reported revenues of $37 million, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States. The Sky Dive Restaurant, on the 44th floor of the North Tower, was also operated by Windows on the World. In its last iteration, Windows on the World received mixed reviews. Ruth Reichl, a New York Times food critic, said in December 1996 that \\"nobody will ever go to Windows on the World just to eat, but even the fussiest food person can now be content dining at one of New York's favorite tourist destinations\\". She gave the restaurant two out of four stars, signifying a \\"very good\\" quality. In his 2009 book Appetite, William Grimes wrote that, \\"At Windows, New York was the main course\\". In 2014, Ryan Sutton of Eater.com compared the now-destroyed restaurant's cuisine to that of its replacement, One World Observatory. He said, \\"Windows helped usher in a new era of captive audience dining in that the restaurant was a destination in itself, rather than a lazy by-product of the vital institution it resided in.\\" =Other buildings= World Financial Center and Battery Park City, next to the World Trade Center, were built on reclaimed land. Five smaller buildings stood on the block. One was the 22-floor hotel, which opened at the southwest corner of the site in 1981 as the Vista Hotel; in 1995, it became the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC). Three low-rise buildings (4 WTC, 5 WTC, and 6 WTC), which were steel-framed office buildings, also stood around the plaza. 6 World Trade Center, at the northwest corner, housed the United States Customs Service. 5 World Trade Center was located at the northeast corner above the PATH station, and 4 World Trade Center, located at the southeast corner, housed the U.S. Commodities Exchange. In 1987, construction was completed on a 47-floor office building, 7 World Trade Center, located to the north of the superblock. Beneath the World Trade Center complex was an underground shopping mall. It had connections to various mass transit facilities, including the New York City Subway system and the Port Authority's PATH trains. One of the world's largest gold depositories was located underneath the World Trade Center, owned by a group of commercial banks. The 1993 bombing detonated close to the vault.Gold, Recovery of The Towers' buried treasure , NY Mag, , 2011 Seven weeks after the attacks, $230 million in precious metals was removed from basement vaults of 4 WTC. This included 3,800 100-Troy-ounce 24 carat gold bars and 30,000 1,000-ounce silver bars.Rediff.com. Reuters, , 2001: Buried WTC gold returns to futures trade . Retrieved , 2008. Major eventsFebruary 13, 1975, fire= On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire broke out on the 11th floor of the North Tower. It spread to the 9th and 14th floors after igniting telephone cable insulation in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors. Areas at the furthest extent of the fire were extinguished almost immediately; the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was concentrated on the 11th floor, fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to fire damage on the 9th through the 14th floors, the water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few of the floors below. At that time, the World Trade Center had no fire sprinkler systems. =February 26, 1993, bombing= Aftermath of the 1993 bombing The first terrorist attack on the World Trade Center occurred on February 26, 1993, at 12:17 p.m. A Ryder truck filled with of explosives, planted by Ramzi Yousef, detonated in the underground garage of the North Tower. The blast opened a 100-foot (30 m) hole through five sublevels with the greatest damage occurring on levels B1 and B2 and significant structural damage on level B3. Six people were killed, and 1,042 others were injured in the attacks, some from smoke inhalation. Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and four other individuals were later convicted for their involvement in the bombing, while Yousef and Eyad Ismoil were convicted for carrying out the bombing. According to a presiding judge, the conspirators' chief aim at the time of the attack was to destabilize the north tower and send it crashing into the south tower, toppling both landmarks. Following the bombing, floors that were blown out needed to be repaired to restore the structural support they provided to columns. The slurry wall was in peril following the bombing and loss of the floor slabs that provided lateral support against pressure from Hudson River water on the other side. The refrigeration plant on sublevel B5, which provided air conditioning to the entire World Trade Center complex, was heavily damaged. After the bombing, the Port Authority installed photoluminescent pathway markings in the stairwells. The fire alarm system for the entire complex needed to be replaced because critical wiring and signaling in the original system were destroyed. A memorial to the victims of the bombing, a reflecting pool, was installed with the names of those who were killed in the blast. It was destroyed following the attacks. The names of the victims of the 1993 bombing are included in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. =January 14, 1998, robbery= Austin J. Tobin Plaza, 1995alt= In January 1998, Mafia member Ralph Guarino gained maintenance access to the World Trade Center. He arranged a three-man crew for a heist that netted over $2 million from a Brinks delivery to the 11th floor of the North Tower. =Other events= On the morning of August 7, 1974, Philippe Petit performed a high-wire walk between the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center. For his unauthorized feat above the ground, he rigged a cable and used a custom-made , balancing pole. He performed for 45 minutes, making eight passes along the wire. Though Petit was charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, he was later freed in exchange for performing for children in Central Park. On February 20, 1981, an Aerol√≠neas Argentinas airliner was guided away by air traffic controllers after radar signals indicated it was on a collision course with the North Tower (1 WTC). The aircraft, which departed from Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and was scheduled to land at nearby JFK Airport, was flying at a much lower altitude than regulations recommended. The 1995 PCA world chess championship was played on the 107th floor of the South Tower. =Proposed lease= In 1998, the Port Authority approved plans to privatize the World Trade Center, and in 2001 sought to lease it to a private entity. Bids for the lease came from Vornado Realty Trust, a joint bid between Brookfield Properties Corporation and Boston Properties, and a joint bid by Silverstein Properties and The Westfield Group. Privatizing the World Trade Center would add it to the city's tax rolls and provide funds for other Port Authority projects. On , 2001, the Port Authority announced that Vornado Realty Trust had won the lease for the World Trade Center, paying $3.25 billion for the 99-year lease. Vornado outbid Silverstein by $600 million though Silverstein upped his offer to $3.22 billion. However, Vornado insisted on last minute changes to the deal, including a shorter 39-year lease, which the Port Authority considered nonnegotiable. Vornado later withdrew and Silverstein's bid for the lease to the World Trade Center was accepted on , 2001, and closed on , 2001. Destruction A fireball rises in the immediate aftermath of United Airlines Flight 175 hitting the South Tower during the September 11 attacks. On September 11, 2001, Islamist terrorists hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 and crashed it into the northern fa√ßade of the North Tower at 8:46:40 a.m.; the aircraft struck between the 93rd and 99th floors. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03:11 a.m., a second group crashed the similarly hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern fa√ßade of the South Tower, striking it between the 77th and 85th floors. The damage caused to the North Tower by Flight 11 destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people. Flight 175 had a much more off-centered impact compared to Flight 11, and a single stairwell was left intact; however, only a few people managed to descend successfully before the tower collapsed. Although the South Tower was struck lower than the North Tower, thus affecting more floors, a smaller number, fewer than 700, were killed instantly or trapped. At 9:59 a.m., the South Tower collapsed after burning for approximately 56 minutes. The fire caused steel structural elements, already weakened from the plane's impact, to fail. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28 a.m., after burning for approximately 102 minutes. At 5:20 p.m. on , 2001, 7 World Trade Center began to collapse with the crumbling of the east penthouse; it collapsed completely at 5:21 p.m. owing to uncontrolled fires causing structural failure. World Trade Center site after 9/11 attacks, seen from above with original building locations outlined in yellow The Marriott World Trade Center hotel was destroyed during the collapse of the two towers. The three remaining buildings in the WTC plaza were extensively damaged by debris and were later demolished. The cleanup and recovery process at the World Trade Center site took eight months. The Deutsche Bank Building across Liberty Street from the World Trade Center complex was later condemned because of the uninhabitable toxic conditions inside; it was deconstructed, with work completed in early 2011. The Borough of Manhattan Community College's Fiterman Hall at 30 West Broadway was also condemned owing to extensive damage, and it was demolished and completely rebuilt. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, media reports suggested that tens of thousands might have been killed in the attacks, as over 50,000 people could have been inside the World Trade Center. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated approximately 17,400 individuals were in the towers at the time of the attacks. Ultimately, 2,753 death certificates (excluding those for hijackers) were filed relating to the 9/11 attacks. 2,192 civilians died in and around the World Trade Center, including employees of Cantor Fitzgerald L.P. (an investment bank on the 101st‚Äì105th floors of One World Trade Center), Marsh & McLennan Companies (located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93‚Äì101, the location of Flight 11's impact), and Aon Corporation. In addition to the civilian deaths, 414 sworn personnel were also killed: 340 New York City Fire Department (FDNY) firefighters; 71 law enforcement officers, including 37 members of the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD) and 23 members of the New York City Police Department (NYPD); 2 FDNY paramedics; and 1 FDNY chaplain. Eight EMS personnel from private agencies also died in the attacks. Ten years after the attacks, the remains of only 1,629 victims had been identified. Of all the people who were still in the towers when they collapsed, only 20 were pulled out alive. New World Trade Center Over the following years, plans were created for the reconstruction of the World Trade Center. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), established in to oversee the rebuilding process, organized competitions to select a site plan and memorial design. Memory Foundations, designed by Daniel Libeskind, was selected as the master plan; however, substantial changes were made to the design. site of the Twin Towers. [ Comparison of the pre-9/11 site (background) and planned rebuild (blue overlay)] The first new building at the site was 7 WTC, which opened on . The memorial section of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum opened on September 11, 2011, and the museum opened on May 21, 2014. 1 WTC opened on , 2014; 4 WTC opened on , 2013; and 3 WTC opened on June 11, 2018. In November 2013, according to an agreement made with Silverstein Properties Inc., the new 2 WTC would not be built to its full height until sufficient space was leased to make the building financially viable. Above-ground construction of 5 WTC was also suspended due to a lack of tenants as well as disputes between the Port Authority and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. In mid-2015, Silverstein Properties revealed plans for a redesigned 2 WTC, to be designed by Bjarke Ingels and completed by 2020 with News Corp as anchor tenant. Four years later, with no anchor tenant for 2 WTC, Silverstein expressed his intent to resume work on the tower regardless of whether a tenant had signed. ImpactOn the surrounding community= The World Trade Center, as seen from a nearby street in 2000 The original World Trade Center created a superblock that cut through the area's street grid, isolating the complex from the rest of the community. The Port Authority had demolished several streets to make way for the towers within the World Trade Center. The project involved combining the twelve-block area bounded by Vesey, Church, Liberty, and West Streets on the north, east, south, and west, respectively. 7 World Trade Center, built on the superblock's north side in the late 1980s, was built over another block of Greenwich Street. The building acted as a physical barrier separating Tribeca to the north and the Financial District to the south. The underground mall at the World Trade Center also drew shoppers away from surrounding streets. The project was seen as being monolithic and overambitious, with the design having had no public input. By contrast, the rebuilding plans had significant public input. The public supported rebuilding a street grid through the World Trade Center site. One of the rebuilding proposals included building an enclosed shopping street along the path of Cortlandt Street, one of the streets demolished to make room for the original World Trade Center. However, the Port Authority ultimately decided to rebuild Cortlandt, Fulton, and Greenwich Streets, which had been destroyed during the original World Trade Center's construction. =As an icon of popular culture= The World Trade Center, as seen from Liberty Island in 1995 Before its destruction, the World Trade Center was a New York City icon, and the Twin Towers were the centerpiece that represented the entire complex. They were used in film and TV projects as \\"establishing shots\\", standing for New York City as a whole. In 1999, one writer noted: \\"Nearly every guidebook in New York City lists the Twin Towers among the city's top ten attractions.\\" There were several high-profile events that occurred at the World Trade Center. The most notable was held at the original WTC in 1974. French high wire acrobatic performer Philippe Petit walked between the two towers on a tightrope, as shown in the documentary film Man on Wire (2008) and depicted in the feature film The Walk (2015). Petit walked between the towers eight times on a steel cable. In 1975, Owen J. Quinn base-jumped from the roof of the North Tower and safely landed on the plaza between the buildings. Quinn claimed that he was trying to publicize the plight of the poor. In 1977, Brooklyn toymaker George Willig scaled the exterior of the South Tower. He later said, \\"It looked unscalable; I thought I'd like to try it.\\" Six years later, high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate Dan Goodwin successfully climbed the outside of the North Tower to call attention to the inability to rescue people potentially trapped in the upper floors of skyscrapers. The complex was featured in numerous works of popular culture; in 2006, it was estimated that the World Trade Center had appeared in some form in 472 films. Several iconic meanings were attributed to the World Trade Center. Film critic David Sterritt, who lived near the complex, said that the World Trade Center's appearance in the 1978 film Superman \\"summarized a certain kind of American grandeur [...] the grandeur, I would say, of sheer American powerfulness\\". Remarking on the towers' destruction in the 1996 film Independence Day, Sterritt said, \\"The Twin Towers have been destroyed in various disaster movies that were made before 9/11. That became something that you couldn't do even retroactively after 9/11.\\" Other motifs included romance, depicted in the 1988 film Working Girl, and corporate avarice, depicted in Wall Street (1987) and The Bonfire of the Vanities (1987). Comic books, animated cartoons, television shows, video games, and music videos also used the complex as a setting.  After the September 11 attacks  After the September 11 attacks, some movies and TV shows deleted scenes or episodes set within the World Trade Center. For example, The Simpsons episode \\"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\\", which first aired in 1997, was removed from syndication after the attacks because a scene showed the World Trade Center. Songs that mentioned the World Trade Center were no longer aired on radio, and the release dates of some films, such as the 2001‚Äì2002 films Sidewalks of New York, People I Know, and Spider-Man, were delayed so producers could remove scenes that included the World Trade Center. The 2001 film Kissing Jessica Stein, which was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival the day before the attacks, had to be modified before its general public release, so the filmmakers could delete the scenes that depicted the World Trade Center. Other episodes and films mentioned the attacks directly, or depicted the World Trade Center in alternate contexts. The production of some family-oriented films was also sped up due to a large demand for that genre following the attacks. Demand for horror and action films decreased, but within a short time demand returned to normal. By the first anniversary of the attacks, over sixty \\"memorial films\\" had been created. Filmmakers were criticized for removing scenes related to the World Trade Center. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post said \\"if we erase the towers from our art, we erase from our memories\\". Author Donald Langmead compared the phenomenon to the 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, where historic mentions of events are retroactively \\"rectified\\". Other filmmakers such as Michael Bay, who directed the 1998 film Armageddon, opposed retroactively removing references to the World Trade Center based on post-9/11 attitudes. Oliver Stone's film World Trade Center‚Äîthe first movie that specifically examined the effects of the attacks on the World Trade Center, as contrasted with the effects elsewhere‚Äîwas released in 2006. Several years after the attacks, works such as \\"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\\" were placed back in syndication. The National September 11 Museum has preserved many of the works that feature depictions of the original World Trade Center.

After graduating with honors from the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design in 2008 (Sculpture) he started volunteering locally and internationally and began connecting his passion for volunteerism with his studio art. Rothschild is an educator and an artist. Education Rothschild spent one year pursuing an MFA in Community Arts from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2013. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Sculpture from the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design in 2008. Early career Rothschild created his first public work in 2006 in collaboration with the children at Milwaukee‚Äôs La Causa Crisis Nursery. The large-scale painted-steel sculpture entitled Gertie Gets Her Ducks in a Row was designed to connect a story from the past to the difficult times of today. The work is now on permanent display along the Milwaukee Riverwalk. Rothschild‚Äôs work has been published in Creative Quarterly and his art has been displayed nationally. In August 2008 his steel sculpture entitled, ‚ÄúBig Wheel Flyer‚Äù was featured at the Craven Arts Council and Gallery‚Äôs 2008 Annual Sculpture Show in North Carolina and his sculpture entitled ‚ÄúM42149‚Äù was displayed and awarded honors at the Visual Arts Society of Texas‚Äô 41st Annual Visual Arts Exhibition. While galleries have honored his work across the country, Rothschild is most known for his public and community sculptures. Career Rothschild creates works of art both for and with, those that inspire him or need inspiration. Defined as ‚Äúunselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another,‚Äù Rothschild sees more value in ‚Äúlove‚Äù than material gain. Rothschild has made it his goal to teach young artists how to make good paint and love their canvas. After traveling to Uganda in 2009 to volunteer his skills in fine art and facilitate a series of art workshops with the children and youth of Amagezi Gemaanyi, a center for art empowerment in Kampala, Rothschild was inspired to become active in his local community and now volunteers as an art teacher working with at-risk youth in the Milwaukee and Baltimore area. Rothschild currently travels to Uganda annually to volunteer and teach with Gujja Ting African Art, an organization he co founded, and currently works out of his studio in Baltimore City. Rothschild is a co-founder and former administrator for GTAA, a non-profit organization in Nabulagala, Uganda. He was an AmeriCorps Member at Access Art, as well as an art instructor, volunteer coordinator, and facilitator in Baltimore, Maryland, 2013-2014. He previously served as Service Learning Program Assistant Coordinator, Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design from 2010 to 2013. While there he developed and coordinated community liaisons as needed for the implementation of course curriculum, promotion of Service Learning at MIAD, and researching Service Learning and Community Service opportunities. WorksGertie Gets Her Ducks in a Row= Gertie Gets Her Ducks in a Row is a public art work by artist Benno Rothschild. It is located on the Milwaukee Riverwalk in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The work depicts Gertie the Duck and her ducklings rowing in a regatta. Gertie stands at the bow of the boat with her wings raised and facing toward her ducklings. The ducklins populate the boat's hull and each hold an oar with a pink shaft and blue fin. The ducklings are each painted a bright solid color‚Äîorange, purple, red, green and yellow. Gertie's body and wings are blue and her back is red. All of the ducks have yellow bills and large eyes. The boat's hull is dark blue with squiggles of paint in varied colors and shapes applied. The sculpture is propped aloft by four steel legs. Location The work is installed near the Wisconsin Avenue bridge across the Milwaukee River, site of the historic event from which the sculpture draws inspiration. To make the work, Rothschild collaborated with children participating in programming offered by La Causa Crisis Nursery and Respite Center. Vandalism The work was repeatedly vandalized following its installation. After the ducklings were stolen from the work in March 2012, Rothschild told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \\"I am really frustrated with what has happened here....

He founded the institutes which later merged into the Meertens Instituut (a research institute operated by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences), of which he was the director until 1965. Education Meertens attended the Stedelijk Gymnasium Middelburg, and studied Dutch in Utrecht. He was promoted in 1943 with a dissertation on literary life in Zeeland in the 16th and 17th centuries, under the direction of Cornelis de Vooys. Career Meertens (right) & C.J.E. Dinaux After his studies, Meertens taught school for a few years. On 1 July 1930 he became secretary of the committee of dialects for the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); starting with only two assistants he built a system of documentation that employed two thousands correspondents throughout the country who reported on local dialects. In 1934 the KNAW started a committee for ethnology, and Meertens presided over that committee as well, laying the foundation for the institute which was to receive his name in 1979. He was actively involved with the Phonologische Werkgemeenschap, an organization of phonologists, and when the Centrale Commissie voor Onderzoek naar het Nederlandse Volkseigen was founded in 1948, a state-supported institution that oversaw the entire field of Dutch linguistics and onomastics, Meertens was appointed president of the bureaus for dialectology, onomastics, and ethnography, a function he held until his retirement in 1965. In 1950 he was one of the founders of the Algemene Vereniging voor Taalwetenschap (AVT), the General Organization for Linguistics. In 1966 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy for Arts and Sciences. Personality Piet Meertens' desk (2015) Meertens was a progressive Christian, and a member of the small Christian Democratic Union. In the 1920s, when in Utrecht, he was a member of the board of the Dutch Association of Vegetarians. He was sympathetic to the anti-militaristic strain in the Dutch Reformed Church, and visited prisoners as part of a missionary organization. Christian-Socialist friends of his were journalist Henk van Randwijk, preachers Willem Banning en Jan Buskes, and poet Fedde Schurer. From 1938 on he was active in the Comit√© van Waakzaamheid, an association of artists and intellectuals inspired by Menno ter Braak which opposed the rise of fascism and nazism. But Meertens was also attached to the ideology of the Greater Netherlands, and cared more for cultural than for national boundaries; it united the Dutch and the Flemish with the Germans, though Meertens associated with Nazis unwillingly. The pro-German president of his committees, professor Jan de Vries, who fled to Germany after the war was over, was a close collaborator and persuaded Meertens to engage in pro-German activities; in 1972 Meertens said he did not realize the full scope of those activities. His role during the war began to be investigated in 2005 by a committee led by Hermann von der Dunk, after sociologist Hans Derks had accused Meertens of collaboration with the Germans and the KNAW of sweeping the matter under the rug. The committee's report, published in 2006, concluded that Meertens was not guilty of collaboration, and that the institute could continue carrying his name.KNAW handhaaft naam Meertens Instituut, Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, 16 okt 2006 Meertens was actively involved with literature and published extensively. After the war he was the editor of De Vlam, where he became acquainted with Henriette Roland Holst. With the rest of the CDU he joined the PvdA (a social-democratic party) in 1946, and became an ecumenical Christian. P.J. Meertens is the model for A.P. Beerta in J. J. Voskuil's novel cycle Het Bureau; Voskuil worked with Meertens, and the titular Bureau (\\"office\\") is the Meertens institute. Bibliography * Jan Noordegraaf, 'Bloemen voor P.J. Meertens'.

The film stars Lauren Cohan and Rupert Evans. It is an international co-production between China and the United States. Filming began on March 10, 2015, in Victoria, British Columbia. STXfilms released The Boy in the United States on January 22. The film received grossed $64 million worldwide on a $10 million budget. A stand-alone sequel, Brahms: The Boy II, was released on February 21, 2020. Plot American Greta Evans travels to England after being hired as a nanny by the elderly Heelshires. Upon her arrival, the couple introduce Greta to her charge: a porcelain doll named Brahms that they treat like their son. The Heelshires coach Greta on taking care of Brahms and their house while they are on holiday; leaving her a list of strict rules to follow, including reading to Brahms in a loud, clear voice and playing loud music for him. Initially, Greta ignores the rules. She regularly calls her sister, who tells her that her abusive ex-boyfriend Cole has been trying to find out where she is. Malcolm, the local grocery deliveryman, stops by often, and Greta learns that the real Brahms was killed in a fire 20 years ago on his eighth birthday. Malcolm asks Greta out, and she accepts. While preparing for the date, her dress and jewelry vanish while she is in the shower; she is lured to the attic by strange noises and locked inside, and is mysteriously let out the next morning. She explains to Malcolm what happened, and they discuss the real Brahms, whom Malcolm says Mr. Heelshire described as \\"odd\\". Strange events occur: a child's sobs are heard in the hallways, phone calls are cut off, and the doll seems to move on its own. After receiving a phone call in which a child's voice urges her to follow the rules, Greta locks herself in her room. She then finds a peanut butter and jelly sandwich outside her door, her favorite, and the child's voice promises he will be good. Believing that Brahms' spirit lives within the doll, Greta begins to take the rules seriously. Remembering that the Heelshires said Brahms was shy, she realizes that the doll only moves when she isn't in the room with him; she demonstrates this to Malcolm, who becomes worried. He informs Greta that a girl Brahms was friends with was found in the forest with her skull crushed. Before the police could question Brahms, the Heelshires' house was burnt down with him in it. Malcolm warns her not to stay, but Greta, having previously suffered a miscarriage after being beaten by Cole, feels obligated to care for Brahms. Elsewhere, the Heelshires write a goodbye letter to Brahms before drowning themselves. One evening, Cole arrives, intending to force Greta back home. For Greta's safety, Malcolm stays nearby. Greta asks the doll for help. Cole wakes up and sees a message written in blood telling him to leave. Believing it was done by either Greta or Malcolm, he angrily smashes the doll to pieces. The house begins to shake and they hears noises behind the walls. The mirror explodes; from a hole behind it emerges the real, now-adult Brahms wearing a porcelain mask identical to the doll's face; after surviving the fire, Brahms has been living in the walls of the house and is abnormal. Brahms kills Cole, then turns on Malcolm and Greta. As they are pursued, Greta and Malcolm discover Brahms' room; a doll made from Greta's missing dress, hair, and jewelry sits in Brahms' bed, and Greta finds the goodbye letter from the Heelshires, revealing their plan of leaving Greta behind as a mate for Brahms. Brahms knocks out Malcolm, threatening to kill him if Greta leaves. Greta is able to escape the house but returns to save Malcolm. Arming herself with a screwdriver, she invokes the rules and forces Brahms to bed. He asks for a good night kiss; when he tries to kiss her, she stabs him with the screwdriver. Brahms tries to choke her but she pushes the screwdriver in deeper and he collapses. Greta rescues Malcolm and they escape the house. Later, Brahms, who has survived, is seen repairing the shattered doll.

She was the first Panamanian woman to publish her poetry. Biography Born in Panama City in 1836, her father was of French origin and her mother Panamanian. As a child, she was very interested in literature and wrote poems in a completely natural style without any trimmings. Her father Saturnino Denis was an editor at the time. She went to the local school in the Santa Ana district but received most of her cultural education at home, meeting poets whose works were published in La Floresta Istme√±a. She married while still young and spent a lengthy period in Nicaragua. By some accounts, she also spent quite some time in Guatemala. The monument to her on Ancon Hill When she returned home, the Panama Canal Zone was in the hands of the Americans. This caused her considerable sadness which is reflected in one of her most beautiful poems, Al Cerro Anc√≥n (1906). Ancon Hill became part of the land taken to build the Panama Canal and the hill became a national symbol after she wrote her poem about the American annexation. Today this hill still boasts a large national flag at its summit. Like her other works, Al Cerro Anc√≥n has a strong patriotic flavour which is also reflected in Zona del Canal (the Canal Zone) which was closed to Panamanians. Other works include Patria, Hojas Secas, Amor de madre (1879) and A la Muerte de Victoriano Lorenzo. Amelia Denis de Icaza died in Managua on 16 July 1911. Legacy There is a large bronze statue to her on Ancon Hill in PanamaMonument to Amelia Denis de Icaza, Minube.com, retrieved 11 March 2015 which appropriately sits at the bottom of the flagpole from which is flown an extremely large Panamanian flag.

Biography  Muzi Epifani was born in Benghazi, Libya. She studied literature and philosophy at the Heidelberg University and the University of Rome La Sapienza, where she obtained a degree in aesthetics under the supervision of Emilio Garroni. She was particularly influenced by the Hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer and the anthropological thought of Ernesto de Martino, whose missions she worked on in Lucania and Salento. During her studies at La Sapienza, she met Alex Duran (to whom she dedicated her novel Pazzi & creature), Gabriele Giannantoni, Enzo Siciliano, and Franco Voltaggio. Epifani was one of the first Italian writers to develop a distinctive style of female writings alongside Natalia Ginzburg, Luce d'Eramo, Dacia Maraini, Biancamaria Frabotta, Gabriella Sobrino, and Angiola Sacripante. She was a very attentive reader of English female writers such as Katherine Mansfield and, above all, Virginia Woolf. She collaborated with various newspapers, such as \\"l'Unit√†\\", \\"l'Avanti!\\", \\"Paese Sera\\". She was considered an environmental activist and \\"Il Globo\\" published her own innovative column on the protection of the Italian landscape and environment entitled \\"Article 9\\", in reference to the Constitution of the Republic of Italy (\\"The Republic promotes the development of culture and scientific and technological research, providing safeguard of the landscape and historical and artistic heritage on the Nation\\"). Epifani also worked as a journalist for RAI, Italy's national public broadcasting company, in the fields of theatre and literature. In her ‚ÄúIl Premio Viareggio? La mia vita‚Äù, Gabriella Sobrino described Muzi Epifani as always \\"surrounded by her children\\". They would work during the nights together \\"when we had finally managed to put to bed the children who would gather around us like puppies in their multi-coloured pyjamas\\". In 1976, her comedy \\"La fuga\\" (The escape) won the \\"Young Theatre\\" Prize. In this satirical play, Epifani intertwined a personal affair with a current political debate concerning the abortion law in Italy. The writer exposed the Italian hypocrisy of people who would permit abortion in the private sphere whilst at the same time criticising it in public. The play has been republished in 2015.

He was the second son of Jean (n√©e Wells) and James. His father worked as a labourer in the local steelworks.  Education  He attended Cromwell Road Junior School and Victoria Street Secondary Modern. Upon leaving school, at the age of fifteen, he spent two years at Middlesbrough Art College. He moved to London when awarded a scholarship to Byam Shaw School of Art and progressed from there to the Royal College of Art from where he graduated, in 1971, with an MA in Fine Art and Anthropology.  Career  The three years after graduation from RCA were spent sailing the seas with the College of the Sea ‚Äì providing art tutelage to merchant seamen and continuing with his own painting. By the time he completed that, he had family responsibilities so returned to Teesside, did a post-graduate course in education and got a job as an art teacher at Gillbrook School (now Gillbrook Academy). He remained in teaching until 1992. Although he spent seven years attending art colleges in London he continued to spend considerable time back home in South Bank, and the environment around there featured in most of the paintings and drawings that he exhibited in a retrospective show at Middlesbrough Art Gallery in 1972. Although this exhibition brought some acclaim,Margaret Hoggarth \\"One Man and his Magic\\" Evening Gazette (Middlesbrough)1 May 1972 there would be only one other exhibition of his work during his lifetime ‚Äì at the Chapel Beck Gallery in Guisborough in 1978. After that he became disillusioned with the art world and declined offers of further exhibitions. He still continued to paint but distributed his work among people that he knew, or exchanged it for goods and services. Due to his idiosyncratic approach to his work, he was not widely known when he died at the age of fifty-six from cancer of the throat. His fame has increased since his death, however, through two major exhibitions of his work. The first of these, at the Dorman Museum in Middlesbrough (October 2012 ‚Äì June 2013), prompted the editor of The Jackdaw to ask himself why he had not previously heard of David Mulholland and declared that his ‚Äúwork hit me immediately as authentic, born of intimate feeling for its subject\\".David Lee \\"How State Art Robs the People\\", The Jackdaw, No. 106 Nov/Dec 2012, p. 7 The second exhibition, at the Kirkleatham Museum (January ‚Äì June 2014), received a five-star review in the Morning Star newspaper.Mike Quille \\"Home is Where the Heart is\\", Morning Star (London) Tuesday 22 April Prior to these exhibitions, three paintings that expressed Mulholland‚Äôs reaction to the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 were exhibited at the Dorman Museum to mark the tenth anniversary of the event.David Whetstone \\"Artist‚Äôs 9/11 Pieces Set to Play Part in Anniversary\\", The Journal: Culture section (Newcastle-upon- Tyne)Tuesday 6 September 2011 References Further reading  Peter McCarthy (2012) ‚ÄúDavid Mulholland, Painter‚Äù The Mulholland Foundation, External sources The Art of David Mulholland website.

The monument was designed in 1975 when the master plan for the Auto Factory District (, Avtozavodsky rajon) of Tolyatti was created. The sculptures were erected in the years 1977‚Äì1979 in a strip of parkland between Revolution Street and Anniversary Street. they are endangered. Description The sculptures are stylized representations of three modes of transport extant at the turn of the 20th century: a paddle-wheel steamboat, a steam locomotive, and a hot air balloon. \\"Hot Air Balloon\\" is a fantastic representation that combines a balloon, gondola, and sails with figures of balloonists. The sculpture seems to be striving upwards, but held by anchor ropes and streamers; a light, delicate design mounted on a heavy prism-shaped foundation, somewhat reminiscent of the balloon in Jules Verne's novel Five Weeks in a Balloon. The dimensions are by by . Sculpture \\"The First Steamboat\\" \\"The First Steamboat\\" is composed of readily recognizable elements of a ship: hull, mast, yards, sails, anchor, flag, and so on. The steam-driven sidewheeler includes metal \\"smoke\\" discharging from the smokestack. On deck is a symbolic romantic couple of the era: a man in a top hat and a woman with a parasol. The sculpture is not a realistic representation of an actual steamboat, and contains many decorative, purely artistic elements. The dimensions are by by . Sculpture \\"The First Locomotive\\" \\"The First Locomotive\\" is generally similar in design and effect. The dimensions are by by . According to critics, the composition is beautifully designed, and well planned to foil defacement by hooligans. The sculptures are made of iron (forged, cast, and welded) on massive reinforced concrete pedestals and limestone slabs. The sculptor is People's Artist of the USSR Andrei Vasnetsov (grandson of Viktor Vasnetsov). The architect is Central Research and Design Institute of Residential and Public Buildings architect and USSR State Prize laureate E. Ioheles (brother of pianist Alexander Ioheles). Endangerment In 2011, due to failure of diligence on the part of the Tolyatti municipal government, the land on which the sculptures stand was found to have passed to private ownership. The owners planned to demolish them and build commercial structures on the site, and a lawsuit by the city to prevent this failed, the judge ruling that the city had failed to prove that the sculptures are a significant cultural heritage. In response, the mayor of Tolyatti, Anatoly Pushkov, said: In the autumn of 2014, a smaller copy of \\"The First Steamboat\\" was put on display at the Shchusev Museum of Architecture in Moscow On the other hand, some commentators held that the sculptures were made in the mode of Soviet times and no longer fit in with the modern spirit of the city. , debate about the fate of the sculptures continued, in connection with discussion about the sale of the land. The mayor's office, in the fall of 2014, included the sculptures in the Tolyatti's beautification program of iconic and socially significant places, so that rather than being destroyed they will be enhanced.

She is a professor of ophthalmology, neurology, and physiology & pharmacology at the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, where she directs the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience. She directed laboratories previously at the Barrow Neurological Institute and University College London. Her research bridges perceptual, cognitive, and oculomotor neuroscience. She is best known for her studies on illusions, eye movements and perception, neurological disorders, and attentional misdirection in stage magic. Early life and education Susana Martinez-Conde was born in 1969 in La Coru√ëa , Spain, to a merchant sailor father from Santander,Spain and a stay-at-home mother from Garcia,Spain. Her maternal grandfather survived the sinking of the Castillo de Olite in 1939, during the Spanish Civil War. She majored in experimental psychology at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid in 1992, and obtained her PhD in medicine and surgery from the neuroscience program at the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela in 1996. She received her postdoctoral training from the Nobel Laureate Prof. David Hubel at Harvard Medical School, Career She became an instructor in neurobiology at Harvard Medical School in 2001. She then became lecturer in ophthalmology and laboratory director at University College London. In 2004, she returned to the United States as an assistant professor, and later, associate professor, at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, where she directed the Laboratory of Visual Neuroscience. In 2014, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, as professor of ophthalmology, neurology, and physiology & pharmacology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, where she directs the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience. Scientific research Much of Susana's research focuses on how our brains create perceptual and cognitive illusions in everyday life. She has studied the Rotating Snakes illusion, Isia Leviant's Enigma illusion, Victor Vasarely's Nested Squares illusion, Troxler fading and other types of perceptual fading illusions, and various perceptual and attentional illusions in stage magic. Martinez-Conde created the Best Illusion of the Year Contest in 2005, and writes the Illusions column for Scientific American: Mind. Martinez-Conde studies the effects of attention on visual perception, and the neural bases of attention and visual awareness. Her research on visual awareness has concentrated on the neural bases of perceptual fading, visual masking, and attentional misdirection in stage magic. Martinez-Conde has pioneered the study of stage magic techniques from a neuroscience perspective. She has proposed that neuroscientists and magicians share many overlapping interests, and that both disciplines should collaborate with one another to mutual advantage. Martinez-Conde has researched the connection between art and visual science, as well as the mechanisms underlying the perception of art. She has studied the neural bases of kinetic illusions in Op art, and discovered novel visual illusions based on the artworks of Victor Vasarely. Martinez-Conde has researched the interactions between eye movements, vision and perception, both in the healthy brain and in neural disease. She investigates how small, involuntary eye movements called microsaccades affect perception and visual processing. She also studies how neurological disease affects eye movements in order to gain a better comprehension of the disorders and aid their differential and early diagnosis. Bibliography In addition to being a regular contributor to Scientific American, Martinez-Conde has co- authored two books: * It is also available in Spanish and Chinese translations. * Sleights of Mind has been called \\"a very cool read\\" by J.

They gradually increased in intensity until they almost completely destroyed Guatemala City and severely damaged the ruins in Antigua Guatemala that had survived the 1773 Guatemala earthquakes.  History  San Francisco church after the earthquakes. The seismic activity started on 17 November 1917 and ruined several settlements around Amatitl√°n. On 25 and 29 December of the same year, and on 3 and 24 January of the next, there were stronger earthquakes felt on the rest of the country, which destroyed a number of buildings and homes in both Guatemala City and Antigua Guatemala. Sometimes the movement was up and down, then sideways. At every new shock a handful of houses went down. In most of the houses, walls cracked in two and then roofs fell in; in churches, bell towers crashed down, burying adjacent buildings and their occupants. Among those buildings destroyed by the earthquakes were a lot of the infrastructure built by general Jos√© Mar√≠a Reyna Barrios and president Manuel Estrada Cabrera, whose legacy has been forgotten by Guatemalans. The Diario de Centro Am√©rica, a semi-official newspaper owned in part by President Estrada Cabrera, spent more than two months issuing two numbers a day reporting on the damage, but after a while, started criticizing the central government after the slow and inefficient recovery efforts. One of its articles said that some holy Jesus images from the city had been saved because they had been taken away from their churches after the first earthquake as they \\"did not want to stay anymore in a city where excessive luxury, impunity and terror were rampant\\". Likewise, the newspaper reported that the National Assembly was issuing \\"excellent\\" laws, but nobody was \\"going by the law\\". Finally, on its front page of May 1918, it said that there was \\"still debris all over the city\\". The Diario de Centro Am√©rica itself was print in the rubble, in spite of which it was able to issue its two daily numbers. Mummies that came out of their tombs when those were broken by the earthquakes in La Merced Church. The French magazine L'Illustration on its 12 January 1918 issue reported on a telegraph cable from 31 December 1917 that Guatemala city had been completely destroyed: two hundred thousand people were left homeless and there were about two thousand deaths. The city's monuments were lost. In 1920, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden arrived to Guatemala on a trip along Central America; his journey took him to Antigua Guatemala and Guatemala City where he saw that the recovery efforts were still not done and the city still lay in ruins. There was still dust whirling in thick clouds, penetrating everywhere ‚Äì clothes, mouth and nostrils, eyes and skin pores ‚Äì visitors got sick until they got used to the dust; the streets were not paved and only one in three houses was occupied, as the others were still in ruins. How the Guatemala City general cemetery appeared before the earthquakes. It was completely destroyed and never fully restored. Public buildings, schools, churches, the theater, and museums were all in the hopeless state of desolation in which they were left by the earthquake. Bits of roof hung down the outsides of the walls and the footway was littered with heaps of stucco ornaments and shattered cornices. A payment of some hundred dollars would ensure that a house that had been marked as insecure with a black cross was then deemed as done with its necessary repairs, allowing the owners to leave the houses empty and in ruins. It was at the Guatemala City General Cemetery that the devastation was most evident: all was demolished on the night of the earthquake and it was said that about eight thousand dead were shaken from their graves, threatening pestilence to the city and forcing the authorities to burn all of them in a gigantic bonfire. The empty tombs were still open in 1920 and no attempt had been made to restore the cemetery to its original condition. Finally, Prince Wilhelm, pointed out that the world had sent help in the form of money and goods, which arrived by shipload in Puerto Barrios, but neither helped the city because millions found their way to the President's treasury and his ministers sent provisions to Honduras and sold them there for a good profit. Aftermath The dead literally came out of their tombs at the Guatemala City General Cemetery. Inside of Guatemala City Cathedral after the earthquakes. The earthquakes marked the beginning of the end of the long presidency of lawyer Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who had been ruling in the country since 1898; firm opposition to his regime started after it became evident that the President was incapable of leading the recovery efforts. For instance, in an interview done in 1970, German literary critic G√ºnter W. Lorenz asked 1967 Literature Nobel Laureate Miguel √Ångel Asturias why he started writing; to his question, Asturias replied: \\"Yes, at 10:25 p.m of 25 December 1917, an earthquake destroyed my city. I remember seeing something like an immense cloud covering the moon. I was in a cellar, a hole in the ground or a cave, or something like that. Right there and then I wrote my first poem, a goodbye song to Guatemala. Later on I was really mad by the circumstances under which the rubble was removed and by the social injustice that became really apparent then.\\" This experience prompted Asturias to start writing when he was 18 years old; he wrote a tale called The political beggars ('), which eventually became his most famous novel: El Se√±or Presidente. Bishop of Facelli, Pi√±ol y Batres from the Aycinena family, began preaching against the government policies in the San Francisco Church in 1919, instructed by his cousin, Manuel Cobos Batres. For the first time, the Catholic Church opposed the President; additionally, Cobos Batres was able to inflame the nationality sentiment of conservative criollo leaders Jos√© Azmitia, T√°cito Molina, Eduardo Camacho, Julio Bianchi and Emilio Escamilla into forming a Central America Unionist party and oppose the strong regime of Estrada Cabrera. The Unionist party began its activities with the support of several sectors of the Guatemala City society, among them the Universidad Estrada Cabrera students and the labor associations, who under the leadership of Silverio Ortiz founded the Patriotic Labor Committee. After a long struggle, Estrada Cabrera was finally overthrown on 14 April 1920.

The dam is situated near the 3.3 km mark on the Pedro Abad-Adamuz highway (CO-412). Its Neo-Mud√©jar design is the result of a collaboration between architect Casto Fern√°ndez Shaw and engineers Carlos Mendoza and Antonio del √Åguila. The Madrid-based engineering consulting firm undertook construction of the dam between 1918 and 1922. Since its inception, the dam has proved valuable to the local population for its contribution to the development and economic expansion of the area. Design Built on the site of some old water mills, the dam creates a grade in the riverbed through the use of two abutments, one on each bank of the river, and five interior buttresses. The buttresses, which sustain the bridge and the six sluice gates, also hold up the metal structure bearing the machines that operate the gates. The abutment on the right bank forms an arched portal over the roadway and houses the access stairway to the control room, whose crowning octagonal turret once bore a dome. This dome, the horseshoe arch and alfiz, the simple and double windows, and the handrail supports all belong to the Neo-Mud√©jar style. The entire concrete structure is covered with a facing of blocks in imitation of stretcher and header bond masonry. The upper metal structure, a lattice box girder, initially held a wooden platform that has since been replaced by a grate. The motors that power the gears and chains used to raise the sluice gates are housed here in protective casings. A traveling bridge crane projects from the upstream side of the girder. From within its two-story wooden cabin, the operator is able to stack metal beams in slots parallel to the sluice gates in order to retain the water and allow the gates to be isolated. The crane is also used to lift motor and gear assembly casings. In addition to its carefully designed mechanisms, the dam has an important artistic value and is in a good state of preservation. El Carpio Hydroelectric Power Station El Carpio Power Station is situated on the lower side of a meander of the Guadalquivir, across from the dam. Also built in 1922, the plant uses three turbine generators to produce electricity. It belongs to Endesa, Spain's largest utility company. As a run-of-the-river power plant, which utilizes the natural flow of water, it has practically no water reserve; its generating capacity therefore depends on the condition of the river. Water is drawn from the upstream dam through a tunnel and deposited next to the power station in a small tank capable of holding . From there, it passes through the turbines and returns to the river. The kinetic energy from flowing water is used by the Francis turbines at a flow rate of per machine to generate mechanical energy. The generators then convert this energy into an alternating current, according to Faraday's Law of Induction, and create an electrical signal which must then coincide with the 50 Hz frequency used by the Spanish power grid. To reach this frequency, the turbines and in turn the generators must rotate at a speed of 214 rpm. Finally, the electric tension must be raised by the plant's transformers in order to reduce energy loss during travel along power lines. The power station was, like the dam, built with a view to aesthetics. The exterior features dressed stone blocks, while its rooftop turrets crowned by brick domes have a remarkably historicist and expressionist character. Other details stand out as well, like the elephant head supporting a balcony, which was produced by sculptor . Presented in Paris at the Decorative Arts Exposition of 1921, the building won a gold medal.

Ferguson was born in Salisbury, Maryland to a Methodist minister, Joseph E. A. Johns (b. 1868). The family moved to Philadelphia in the early 20th century, settling in Germantown, and she later married physician Emanuel Ralph Ferguson (1899-1985). Ferguson was a well known cosmetology expert and a successful Black business owner in mid-twentieth century Philadelphia. Ferguson was a member of the National Beauty Culturists' League (NBCL), organized in 1919 in Philadelphia. As Tiffany M. Gill argues in Beauty Shop Politics: African American Women's Activism in the Beauty Industry, the NBCL was an incubator for Black women's leadership during the Jim Crow era. Ferguson also belonged to Theta Nu Sigma, which Cordelia Green Johnson, a wealthy Chicago real estate owner and president of the NBCL, started in 1946. Members of the sorority held bachelor's degrees granted by the National Institute of Cosmetology. Ferguson served as Theta Nu Sigma's president for a number of years. In the 1940s Ferguson, along with her friend Naomi T. Fassett (1908-1983), opened a franchise of the Apex School of Beauty and Culture, one of the first beauty school for Black women in Philadelphia. In this sense, Ferguson could be said to follow in the footsteps of Madame C.J.Walker. The school, located at 525 S. Broad Street, operated for 35 years. Ferguson's papers are held by the Pennsylvania Historical Society.

The essential bowling action was still underarm but the introduction of a ball travelling through the air coupled with a bounce was a key point of evolution in the sport's history, especially as it was the catalyst for the invention of the straight bat, which replaced the old \\"hockey stick\\" design. It was the first of three keypoint evolutions in bowling: the others were the introduction of the roundarm style in the 1820s and overarm in the 1860s. John Nyren's evidence In John Nyren's Memoranda (1832), he wrote the following account of the All-England v Kent match played in 1744:Nyren, pp. 153‚Äì154. > It arose from a challenge given by Lord John Sackville on the part of the > County of Kent to play all England; and it proved to be a well contested > match as will appear from the manner in which the players kept the field. > The hitting however could neither have been of a high character nor indeed > safe, as may be gathered from the figure of the bat at that time; which was > similar to an old-fashioned dinner knife, curved at the back and sweeping in > the form of a volute at the front and end. With such a bat the system must > have been all for hitting; it would be barely possible to block and when the > practice of bowling length balls was introduced and which gave the bowler so > great an advantage in the game it became necessary to change the form of the > bat. It was therefore made strait in the pod (sic). Some years after this > the fashion of the bat having been changed to a strait form the system of > stopping and blocking was adopted. This is effectively all that can be found in early sources about the introduction of the \\"length ball\\" and the consequent development of the \\"strait\\" bat. The evolution occurred after 1744 and before 1770. Given the rise of Hambledon from the mid-1760s, it is believed to have happened c.1760 during the Seven Years' War in which there was apparently a lull in important matches, certainly in terms of known matches until it ended in 1763. Different styles of play Whereas roundarm and overarm were highly controversial and were introduced in the face of fierce opposition, there is nothing in the historical records which precisely dates the introduction of pitching and nothing which indicates that it was controversial. It has been suggested that the change effectively created a different code of cricket, just as there are now two different codes of rugby football, though in cricket the new completely superseded the old. The two eras are bridged by the career (c.1749 to c.1774) of John Frame, one of the game's first great bowlers, who played with pioneers like Thomas Waymark, Richard Newland and Robert Colchin at the beginning of his career and with pre-modernists like John Small and Lumpy Stevens at the end. As described in History of cricket to 1725, early cricketers played in their everyday clothes and had no protective equipment such as gloves or pads. A 1743 painting by Francis Hayman of a game in progress at the Artillery Ground depicts two batsmen and a bowler dressed alike in white shirt, breeches, white knee-length stockings and shoes with buckles. The wicket-keeper wears the same clothes with the addition of a waistcoat. An umpire and scorer wear three-quarter length coats and tricorn hats. Apart from the shirts and stockings, none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground, as in bowls, at varying speed towards a wicket consisting of two stumps mounted by a single crosspiece. The batsman addresses the delivery with a bat that resembles a modern hockey stick, this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground.The painting is Francis Hayman's Cricket at the Artillery Ground, 1743. It hangs at Lord's Cricket Ground. When the ball was bowled along the ground, the batsman used his curved bat to attack it and try to hit it away, usually with the intention of lofting it over the fielders. There was, as such, no defensive technique other than the most rudimentary and instinctive attempt to stop a ball that had deceived him. The pitched delivery made the curved bat obsolete and the straight bat lent itself to the deployment of a defensive stroke. As the aim of the batsman with a curved bat was to hit the ball over the fielders, low scores were normal. If he did not time his shot correctly, the chances were high that he would miss the ball and be bowled or stumped; or else if he hit it poorly, he would not clear the fielder and be caught out. In addition, the pitches of the time were little more than rough tracks which were to the bowler's advantage. One of the greatest players of the pioneering period was Richard Newland of Slindon and Sussex. In July 1745, he scored 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground.Ashley-Cooper (ASW), p. 36. It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings as it may have been his match total (there is a parallel here with Small in a 1768 match). If it was one innings, it is the highest individual score recorded during the pioneering period and, for its time, was a very high score which could equate in real terms to a modern triple-century. Influence of Hambledon Although the Hambledon Club is widely and erroneously called the \\"Cradle of Cricket\\", it can at least, wrote F. S. Ashley-Cooper, \\"claim to have been the centre in which the game was first brought to a certain degree of perfection and was developed in several respects to its lasting advantage\\".Ashley-Cooper (HCC), p. 17. In the first illustration of his book, Ashley-Cooper depicted a curved bat, labelling it: \\"The type of bat used in the earlier Hambledon matches\\". This indicates his belief that the straight bat was invented after Hambledon became a noted team.Ashley-Cooper (HCC), illustration facing p. 20. Ashley-Cooper believed that the club was founded in the early 1750s but it is possible that it was only a loose parish organisation at that time and that the club per se was not formally constituted until the 1760s. Certainly a team representing Hambledon played Dartford, one of the country's most accomplished teams, in 1756.Ashley- Cooper (HCC), pp.18‚Äì19. It seems, therefore, that the innovations of pitched delivery and straight bat were introduced just at the time when Hambledon came to the fore and so perhaps, as Ashley-Cooper suggested, Hambledon qualifies as the \\"cradle\\" of a new code of cricket. It has been suggested, certainly in speculation, that John Small invented the straight bat, though it is more accurate to suggest that he was the first to master its use. With the transition from the pioneering era of cricket, Hambledon saw in a new \\"pre- modern\\" phase defined by underarm pitching which lasted until the introduction of roundarm bowling in the years following the Napoleonic Wars. It is not known who first bowled a pitched delivery, or when, or where, but it is likely that the style was developed primarily at Hambledon, although the leading bowler of the 1760s and 1770s, Lumpy Stevens, played for Chertsey and Surrey.

She starts off as easily frightened and worried and a bit of a coward, but gains courage and self confidence throughout the series. She at first dated Taiga because she was scared he would beat her if she didn't, but as she gets to know him realizes how kind he truly is and falls in love with him. Her parents died when she was six so her uncle Sou looks after her. She initially had a crush on Sou, but later realizes that it was not a romantic love. Despite her shy personality, she does become more perceptive of how people feel and does everything to help others, especially her friends and family. She is cute, pretty, intelligent, and girly but a terrible cook. ; Taiga Onise : A boy with the face of a demon but the heart and purity of an angel who is in love with Kogure after she gave him her umbrella and bandages upon seeing him in the rain after a fight. He dyes his hair red which makes him seem like a delinquent but in reality did so because he admired the red ranger and wanted to look and be as heroic as him. His mother divorced his father when he was in third grade and to help support her he learned how to cook and take care of the house. He also has an older brother who is married. He enjoys making adorable lunches (sometimes with hearts), doing grand romantic gestures like confessing to Kogure with a bouquet of flowers, and being embarrassed by the mere thought of kissing Kogure. He is faithful to her and despite his appearances would never start a fight without a good reason. He is also an animal lover. ; Sou Kogure : Nao's uncle and guardian. After his sister and brother-in-law's death, he quit his job and dedicated himself to taking care of his niece Nao. He is quiet, mature, and wears glasses. He is also a good cook. He is very wise, often giving good advice and insight for Nao and is envious of Taiga as Nao is growing up and moving on without him, but at the same time supports their relationship and acts as a big brother to him. He runs a cafe called Felice. He is in his mid-twenties and used to be a smoker but quit after adopting Nao. ; Ayumu Misaki : A good-looking boy with a short temper and dirty mouth, often cussing like a sailor. He is recruited against his will by his classmate Taiga to join their first field trip group. He is fairly sensitive; Kayo calls him a tsundere (cold at first, but nicer after getting to know him) ; Kayo Yashiro : A beautiful but quiet loner girl who initially joins Nao and Taiga's group for their field trip preparation, later saying that she found it to be fun, and that she liked the food. She is a bit sadistic in prompting people to do things, but helps Nao with her relationship. She is a straight-A student. She tends to hang out with Ayumu Misaki after they pair Nao and Taiga together. ; Ayaha Futami : Taiga's classmate who befriends him after dismissing rumors about him. He is handsome, popular, and athletic. He enjoys receiving attention and hanging out with others but tends to find it tiring that he has to act rightful and cheerful around people but Nao points out his kindness at being able to handle and socialize with others, causing him to fall in love with her. He describes himself as someone who steals what he wants but realizes Nao and Taiga have a strong relationship and concedes defeat and remains friends with Taiga, but promises to steal Nao if the two break up.

The film is an adaptation of Washington Irving's 1819 short story \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" with some differences in the plot. The film focuses on the title character whose idle life is made difficult by his cantankerous wife. Winkle heads into the mountains and encounters spirits of Henry Hudson's men. Upon partaking of their alcohol, Winkle falls into a slumber for twenty years. He returns home and has difficulty proving his identity and must save his property from an unlawful accusation by his rival. After he proves his identity, he is reunited with his family. The title character was played by Frank H. Crane, but the production credits are largely unknown. The film was released on December 6, 1910, and met with positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from December 10, 1910. It states: \\"Rip Van Winkle, although a loving father to his little girl Meenie and a hail-fellow-well-met with all of his fellow townsmen, is being constantly scolded by his wife for leading an idle and profitless existence. Rip is also fond of the bottle and spends a greater part of his time and money at the village tavern. Catching him entering the house late one night after a day's carousing, his wife Gretchen becomes thoroughly angry with him and drives him from the house. In the face of a terrible storm with only his dog Schneider and his faithful rifle to protect him, Rip wanders toward the mountains. Here he comes across a band of gnomes who are supposed to be the spirits of Heinrich Hudson [sic] and his merry men who disappeared near the Catskill Mountains hundreds of years before, and had never been heard of since. The gnomes give Rip some magic schnapps to drink, and under its influence he goes to sleep for 20 years. When he awakes, he is an old man and in ragged clothes. His dog is dead, and his rifle has rusted away. He makes his way as best he can back to the village, and his own home. But there no one knows him. He finds his wife married to another man, his daughter grown to womanhood, and most of his old friends dead and gone. Rip, however, finally manages to prove his identity, and also to lay claim to his property, which has greatly increased in value during his sleep, in which he is just in time to save from being unlawfully confiscated by his old-time enemy. Happily reunited to his family, Rip looks forward to his declining years with a spirit born of peace and solace.\\"  Cast  *Frank H. Crane as Rip Van Winkle *Marie Eline  Production  Rip Van Winkle (left) after his twenty year sleep. The production and an adaptation of Washington Irving's story of Rip Van Winkle. The stage adaptation was well-known and the adaptation would be compared to Joseph Jefferson's portrayal on the stage. The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The adaptation differs from the original in some ways, including that Winkle's cantankerous wife has remarried instead of died. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Sometimes the directional credit is given to Theodore Marston. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908‚Äì1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Path√©, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. The same work also credits Alphonse Ethier with a role, but this is not cited by Bowers. The only known cast credits are for Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list included G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Release and reception  Joseph Jefferson was an iconic figure known for his role as Rip Van Winkle. The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on December 6, 1910. The film had a wide national release, advertising theaters for the Thanhouser film include those in Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Kansas, and Indiana. The film received positive reviews in trade publications. The Moving Picture World review said. \\"Probably the story of Rip Van Winkle as told by Washington Irving will always be a delight. Surely the Rip Van Winkle, as depicted by the late Joseph Jefferson, will linger long in the memory of those fortunate enough to have seen it. Unquestionably, however, the third in the list of delights is this film from Thanhouser which tells the story over again in much the same way that Jefferson told it. The Rip of Jefferson and the Rip of Irving are two different versions, though both do substantially the same things. ... It is a good piece of work from every standpoint. The actors have entered into the spirit of the story and have depicted it with close adherence to the facts as they are related in the original. The stage manager understood what was required to make the background appear natural, while the photographer handled the camera with full knowledge of the requirements.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer also agreed and commended the film by stating, \\"The Thanhouser Company has done very well with this old legend, paying particular attention to details. ... The acting is exceptionally good for a story representing that era of time, and the adaption is very clear to the spectator.\\" See also * List of American films of 1910 Notes References External links * Category:1910 films Category:1910 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films based on works by Washington Irving Category:Thanhouser Company films Category:Lost American films ","title":"Rip Van Winkle (1910 film)"},{"id":"45646264","text":"Dalcerides chirma is a moth in the family Dalceridae.

This album was the sixth album in the \\"Xou da Xuxa\\" collection, which totals seven. In this album are included songs like \\"O Xou da Xuxa Come√ßou\\", \\"Novo Planeta\\" and \\"Hoje √© Dia de Folia\\". The album sold more than 1 million copies, receiving platinum certification by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD).  Production  The studio album contains two re-recordings of international songs: \\"N√£o Basta\\", a version of \\"No Basta\\" by the Venezuelan singer and composer Franco De Vita and \\"Bom Dia\\", which was recorded years before by the country duo Chit√£ozinho and Xoror√≥. A great curiosity of the album, is that the song \\"Hoje √© Dia de Folia\\", had its first chorus cut due to lack of space in the LP (being of the duration of 3:15), the integral version of the song, was only launched in the third official Brazilian compilation of Xuxa, the P√©rolas (with the duration of 4:16). Contrary to popular belief, Xou da Xuxa Seis chosen photos for the cover and back cover of Xuxa Seis are from the rehearsal for the studio album Xuxa 5 (1990). These same photos were even published in the international magazine Paula in October 1990. So that the public did not confuse with its album in Spanish language Xuxa 2 that had been released shortly before and had the same cover, was inserted a Brazilian flag in the cover of Xuxa Seis. Xou da Xuxa Seis was produced by Max Pierre, Michael Sullivan and Paulo Massadas, with artistic coordination Marlene Mattos and Xuxa. Release and reception Xou da Xuxa Seis released on September 12, 1991 by Som Livre, in CD, cassette and LP formats. The album was certified platinum by the Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD), selling about 1.1 million copies, the second with less sales of Xuxa's Xou collection. In 1992, was launched in Uruguay in cassette version, but without authorization, being a bootleg. The album was reissued in 2013 by Som Livre in partnership with Xuxa Produ√ß√µes. The disc is part of the collection box Xou da Xuxa. Promotion In addition to singing the songs in the television program, Rede Globo's programming featured an album commercial in two versions: one of 15 and another of 30 seconds. In fact, this commercial was starring actress Deborah Secco. Posters announcing the release of the album were spread across several cities in Brazil.

Q magazine (London, UK). p. 103. Later that year, the band performed at Shoreditch's The 1-2-3-4 Festival while their track \\"I, Rockstar\\" was included in the festival's accompanying compilation of tracks by underground and \\"inspirational international\\" artists. In 2013, the group released a remix album titled Music for Homeowners - which featured mixes by Mogwai, Public Service Broadcasting, Saint Etienne and other special guests - whilst they toured the UK. During the making of this album, the band held a remix contest for the track \\"Cathedral City Comedown\\" which was won by Netherman, a songwriter from Ohio, USA. In May 2015, the band released their second studio album The Male Eunuch on CD, vinyl, download and as a downloadable PowerPoint file. A limited edition box set was also made available containing all four formats along with a signed art print and \\"unique Pre New memorabilia\\". The group promoted the album by playing a handful of shows around the UK (including a few supporting The Fall and Saint Etienne) and appearing on Marc Riley's show for BBC6 Music where they performed three tracks from the album. The Male Eunuch received widespread critical acclaim from the music press with The Guardian making it their 'Album of the Week'. Following the album's release, a video for the track \\"Janet vs John\\" (taken from the PowerPoint version of the album) was released via YouTube.  Musical style  Perhaps due to the presence of Stuart Boreman, Gordon King and Jamie Fry, the group's sound bares some similarities to Earl Brutus however, contributions from the group's more recent members (namely Stuart Wheldon Vinny Gibson and Laurence Bray) ensure that The Pre New have a sound that remains contemporary. The group's music references glam rock, acid house, EBM, synthpop, punk rock and nu-disco as well as visual artists including Jeff Koons (from whom the band gets its name) and Jeremy Deller.

It was finished in 1969 and premiered in 1971.  Composition  Synapha√Ø was initially commissioned by Hofstra University on New York's Long Island for the conductor Eleazar de Carvalho and the pianist Jocy de Oliveira. It was finished in 1969 and premiered at the 1971 Royan Festival, of which he was a regular composer, during the festival's Xenakis Day, in which ten of Xenakis's most important works were performed. The piece was performed by Georges Pludermacher at the piano and the Orchestre Philharmonique de l'ORTF with Michel Tabachnik. The piece was later published by √âditions Salabert in May 1981.  Structure  Synapha√Ø consists of only one movement and takes approximately 12‚Äì16 minutes to perform. It has largely been categorized as a piano concerto, because of the solo piano's prominent part and its cadenza. It is scored for a solo piano and a large orchestra of 86 musicians, consisting of: * 3 flutes * 3 oboes * 3 clarinets * 3 bassoons * 4 French horns * 4 trumpets * 4 trombones * 1 tuba As well as a large percussion section and a large string section. The orchestra is set vertically on stage towards the audience. The instruments are put into four groups: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. That way, the instruments are separated into almost even groups, as expressed in the score. The composition style rejects the idea of a dialogue between the solo piano and the orchestra, but rather promotes a conjunction between these two elements, hence the title of the piece. Xenakis considers the compositional style used in the piece as a continuation of his own Eonta (1963‚Äì64), which eventually culminated in Evryali (1973) and Erikhthon (1974). The piano part is of extreme difficulty and is written on ten staves, one for each of the pianist's fingers.  Reception  The piece was highly successful in the premi√®re and immediately encored. Jacques Lonchampt, from Le Monde, wrote that Synapha√Ø has \\"a torrential score, tossing in a kind of perpetual tremolo on top of which break through frenzied rhythmic sequences, but also a whole agitation, shuddering and truly musical\\". Musicologist Henry-Louis de La Grange said of the piece: \\"Set against a flamboyant orchestral tapestry, occasionally pierced by harsh cries from the brass, the highly elaborate piano part (the score uses one stave for each finger!) stands out in high relief, with a tremendous, rhythmic drive\\".  Recordings  * Geoffrey Douglas Madge recorded it in November 1975, with Elgar Howarth conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra. The recording was later released by Decca Records.

Biography Gloria Bonder completed her studies in the University of Buenos Aires and became psychologist in 1970. She earned her PhD in Gender and Education at the University of Cambridge. In 1979, during the last dictatorship which ruled her country and with precarious security she founded the Center for Women's Studies (CEM), an organisation that played a major role in the reorganisation of the feminist movement in Argentina.

Bonder recognises that \\"there are significant advances in women's rights\\" and the acceptance of equal rights between men and women has been \\"gaining consensus\\". Nevertheless, she points the \\"significant gaps between formal equality and real equality. The division of labor at home hasn't change; women assume almost all care without recognition for its gender-based violence and even though it has entered the public discourse it has not progressed far enough in terms of prevention and protection. Much remains to be done regarding the participation of women in science and technological innovation. Also the empowerment of women in their sexual and reproductive choices remains highly controversial. The most difficult thing, from my experience, are the institutional cultures and subjectivities that are threatened by changes that touch very deep, unconscious fibers that can generate fears and resistance \\". Bonder also questioned the attitude of the \\"private sector, at least in Latin American countries, which is not present or help visibly transform gender inequalities.\\"  Works  * Los estudios de la Mujer y la cr√≠tica epistemol√≥gica a los paradigmas de las ciencias humanas, Buenos Aires, CEM, 1982. * G√©nero y subjetividad: avatares de una relaci√≥n no evidente, Interdisciplinary Gender Studies Program (PIEG), University of Chile, 1998.

This first church was considerably smaller and lacked a tower. It was enlarged during the Middle Ages, with in total around between the 14th and 16th centuries. An original wooden ceiling was during this process also replaced with a vaulted ceiling, the tower and a church porch added and the gables adorned with crow-stepped gables. The church porch has since been converted into a side chapel, and the crow-stepped gables have disappeared. Gone are also a set of murals which adorned the vaults. The church was renovated at the end of the 19th century and again in 1916 by Swedish architect Theodor W√•hlin (1864-1948). Between 1649‚Äî1930 the church was subjected to the overlord-ship of the Piper family (members of the Swedish nobility) of Krageholm Castle, which meant that the family received some of its income from the church and was responsible for maintaining and decorating it.

It is one of six paintings looking down the Grand Canal towards the Salute church. This Grand Canal series is in turn part of a larger series of paintings of Venice which Monet undertook during 1908 on his only visit to the city. The artist is generally regarded by art historians as being at the peak of his powers at this period. The paintings were begun en plein air and completed in France. This painting is a classic view of the Grand Canal, an attempt to capture the ever-changing face of Venice, as seen from the Palazzo Barbaro, one of the places where he stayed during his trip. In 2015, it was sold for more than $35 million at an auction by Sotheby's. Sotheby's called this painting \\"one of the most celebrated Venice paintings\\". Previously it has been in the private collection of the New Orleans sugar magnate, Hunt Henderson, who was a noted art collector.[Sugar magnate Hunt Henderson formed the first collection in the South of the French Impressionists, with multiple examples by Monet, Renoir, Degas, and others. Henderson was an original trustee of the Delgado and generously lent his collection for the opening of the Museum.] History This painting was undertaken on Monet's trip to Venice in the autumn of 1908, when the artist responded to an invitation from the American woman Mary Young Hunter, to visit her at the Palazzo Barbaro, in Venice. Monet was 68 years old this year. Hunter was a friend of Monet's wife, Alice, who invited the couple to come to visit her in Venice, where she rented this palazzo. Initially Monet was not keen but he did decide to travel. Monet and his wife arrived in Italy on October 1. While there Monet completed a series of artwork on the Canale Grande painting the same motif at different times of the day. Monet had the habit of studying the same subject in a varying light, at different times of the day, which resulted during his active career in many distinct Monet series, like for example the Water Lilies series, Poplar series, Rouen Cathedral series, Haystacks series and Charing Cross Bridge series. Monet painted 37 works of Venice during his three-month stay in Italy, from October to December, including this painting and five more depicting the same theme, Canale Grande. One is hosted at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Painting This painting depicts the view from the Palazzo Barbaro. Monet‚Äôs series introduced a fresh approach to a theme that was painted by many notable artists before him. The series are a pictorial exploration of the light upon the ancient city. The painter captured the sensations according to how the appearance of the motif changed as the light shifted on the water and its surroundings. The painter used the mooring-poles to counterbalance the buildings on the other side of the canal. The Baroque architecture of the church of Santa Maria della Salute is prominent. Arguably, Monet was more preoccupied with capturing the light on the water than the well known panoramas and sights of Venice.

Life  Joseph Arthur Younger was a native of Washington, D.C., and was a graduate of the architecture school at George Washington University. In 1920, he married Ethel Entwisle; they has one son, Bruce. For several years after graduation, Younger was associated with Washington architectural firms, such as Waggaman & Ray, and in 1922 he went into practice for himself. He designed several important buildings, including the Kennedy‚ÄìWarren, and the Sixth Presbyterian Church, for which he received an award from the Washington Board of Trade. The Architects' Advisory Council had extended high commendation for this work, and for that of the Blackstone Hotel.

The title was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on July 21, 2015. The game allows players to play as an elephant called Tembo, who has different abilities to smash through structures and objects, and is on a journey to rescue the metropolis known as the \\"Shell City\\" from an invading evil army known as \\"Phantom\\". Gameplay A gameplay screenshot of the game showing Tembo, the playable character, smashing through objects Tembo the Badass Elephant is a 2D platform side-scrolling game in which players take control of an elephant named Tembo, as he progresses through Shell City to stop the invasion of a military force called the Phantom. The title features visuals similar to that of cartoons and comic books, and divided into three different zones with three basic levels and an enemy base, followed by a boss stage each. Each enemy base can only be unlocked by killing a set quota of enemies on previous levels. Once all three zones are completed, a fourth, last zone consisting of two levels and the final boss stage is unlocked. The major goal of every level is to reach the end of the level while destroying as much of the enemy force as possible, while innocent citizens held prisoners are scattered around the stage, waiting to be rescued as well, and a medal is awarded for rescuing all hostages in a stage. Tembo can perform different movements, like smashing objects with his tusks, jumping, dashing, punching and stomping with his body to destroy structures, enemies, and enemies' vehicles like tanks in order to progress. Tembo can also store water on his trunk to put out fires or shortcut electrical traps. Players are also tasked to solve puzzles throughout the game. Momentum and destruction are emphasized in the game. Tembo's health can be replenished by collecting special crates located throughout the stage, and, by collecting 300 peanuts, Tembo is awarded an extra life that comes in the form of a can of peanut butter. The game environments are interactive, allowing Tembo the chance to unleash more destruction. Additionally, Tembo is accompanied and assisted by a bird called Picolo throughout the game. Development The title was officially announced on March 11, 2015, by Game Freak, which had previously developed the main series Pok√©mon-video games, and Sega, a video game publisher. The collaboration between Game Freak and Sega was revealed one week prior to the game's announcement. According to director James Turner, Tembo was \\"Rambo in elephant form\\". Inspirations were also drawn from several action movies of the 1980s, Dumbo as well as other video game franchises like Metal Slug, Donkey Kong Country and Yoshi's Island. Inspirations were also drawn from HarmoKnight, one of Game Freak's earlier games. Developers also once thought to turn the game into an endless runner but the idea was later scrapped. The title was released on July 21, 2015, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Reception The initial reception of the game was positive, with critics surprised by the nature of the game and the game's protagonist Tembo. Comparisons were drawn between the game and the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Tembo the Badass Elephant received mixed reviews upon release. Aggregating review websites Metacritic gave the PlayStation 4 version 71/100 based on 20 reviews. Chris Carter from Destructoid gave the game an 8 out of 10, praising the game's open-ended level design for allowing players to use different approaches to complete their objectives. In addition, he praised the game's artstyle, which he compared to works from Cartoon Network. However, Tom Orry from VideoGamer.com was much more negative about the game, giving it a 6 out of 10. While applauding the game's gameplay, which he described as \\"a neat mix of Sonic the Hedgehog and the sidescrolling parts of Crash Bandicoot\\", he strongly criticized the point unlocking system, which tasks players to gain enough points before proceeding to the next level, as he considered such features \\"a forced grind\\". IGN awarded it a score of 7 out of 10, saying \\"Tembo stumbles at times, but its overall charm, and moments of rhythmic zen keep it fun throughout.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official website Category:2015 video games Category:Fictional elephants Category:Platform games Category:Sega video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Single-player video games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Game Freak games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Elephants in art ","title":"Tembo the Badass Elephant"},{"id":"45646749","text":"The Nelson Twins (or Nelson Twins, Nelson Bros) are an Australian-based stand- up comedy duo consisting of identical twins Chris and Justin Nelson.https://files.list.co.uk/images/festivals/2010/fringe/show_7004_20354.jpgJustin and Chris Nelson Early life The brothers grew up in New South Wales.

Projective Set (sometimes shortened to ProSet) is a real-time card game derived from the older game Set. The deck contains cards consisting of colored dots; some cards are laid out on the table and players attempt to find \\"Sets\\" among them. The word projective comes from the game's relation to Projective spaces over the finite field with two elements. Projective Set has been studied mathematically as well as played recreationally. It has been a popular game at Canada/USA Mathcamp.https://www.mathcamp.org/2014/academics/Week4Blurbs.pdf  Rules  A Projective Set card has six binary attributes, or bits, generally represented by colored dots. For each color of dot, each card either has that dot or does not. There is one card for each possible combination of dots except the combination of no dots at all, making 2^6 - 1 = 63 cards total. Three cards are said to form a \\"set\\" if the total number of dots of each color is either 0 or 2. Similarly, four or more cards form a \\"set\\" if the number of dots of each color is an even number. A card and itself could be said to form a two-card set, but as the cards in the deck are all distinct, this does not arise in actual gameplay. = Original Version = In the original version, as in Set, 12 cards are laid out on the table. The first player to find three cards which form a set and call out \\"set\\" takes the three cards. Three new cards are then dealt and the play continues until the deck is depleted. If at any time the players agree there is no set among the cards, three new cards can be dealt, bringing the total number of cards on the table to 15. Other than this, new cards are not dealt out unless the number of cards on the table goes below 12. The game ends when the deck is depleted and no more sets can be found among the cards on the table. The player who captured the most sets is the winner. = 7-card Version = A variation of the game, more popular than the original, allows sets of any size, rather than just sets of size three. 7 cards are put out on the table at a time, and when a set is found (with anywhere from 3-7 cards), all the cards from the set are taken and then replaced. Points are generally given at the end according to how many cards each player captured rather than how many sets. It turns out that among any 7 cards there is a set, under these rules, so there is no extra rule necessary for the case that no set can be found.  Mathematics  The cards of a Projective Set deck can be thought of as nonzero vectors in the finite vector space \\\\mathbb{F}_2^6. The collection of all such vectors is the finite projective space with order 2 and dimension 5. Three cards form a set if and only if the corresponding points are collinear in that space. More generally, in the variant, n cards form a set if and only if the corresponding vectors add to the zero vector. In Set, there can exist 20 cards out of the 81 without a set, but no more. In Projective Set, there can exist up to 32 out of the 63 cards with no (3-card) set.

Early life Mansfield was a descendant of many colonial families of Massachusetts, most notably John Alden, and was a distant cousin of Frank Gannett. She was born in 1847 on Kingston Street in Boston, Massachusetts, the first and only child of Sarah H. Gannett Mansfield and Joseph Mansfield, who had both been employed at the Boston Transcript. When Josie Mansfield was about three months old, her parents moved to a boarding house at 13 Lincoln St. They later moved to 15 Crescent Place, where they lived for six months. In 1849 or 1850, Joseph Mansfield joined the California gold rush. On August 12, 1850, the U.S. Census shows Josie Mansfield, 3, living in Boston Ward 8 with her uncle, Charles H. Mansfield, 26, her grandmother Caroline Mansfield, 50, and her aunt Caroline Mansfield, 19. The absence of Sarah Gannett Mansfield suggests that she may have been in California with her husband. On the morning of June 23, 1854, Joseph Mansfield was murdered on the streets of Stockton, California by a business rival. After her father's death, Mansfield moved with her mother Sarah to Mystic Street, near the Bunker Hill Monument. Charles Mansfield, Joseph's brother, also lived in Charlestown at the time of his brother's death, and reportedly took a great interest in his widowed sister-in-law. He invited Sarah and Josie to live with him. The 1855 Massachusetts Census lists Charles H. Mansfield, 32, living with Sarah H. Mansfield, 26, and Hellen J. Mansfield (Josie), 8. On October 27, 1856, Charles and Sarah married in Charlestown, Massachusetts. According to Barbara Goldsmith, \\"Josie would later say that her stepfather sexually molested her when she was twelve and continued to do so for three years, threatening to maim her if she ever spoke of it. Josie did not tell her mother, who by this time was drinking heavily.\\" On July 21, 1860, the United States Census shows Charles Mansfield, 40, fish dealer, living in Charlestown with Sarah Mansfield, 38, Josephine Mansfield, 14, and Lizzy Spillard, 27, an Irish-born house keeper. At the time, Charles owned $5,000 worth of real estate and $1,000 worth of personal estate. Josie Mansfield attended school in Charlestown, where she was very popular, especially with the boys. She had dark eyes, dark wavy hair, and ruddy cheeks. Her plump, well-developed figure was flattered by the shorter hemlines (that often revealed a glimpse of petticoat) and higher heels that were fashionable at the time. Goldsmith wrote that \\"By the time Josie was fifteen, her stepfather was selling her to other men.\\" Charles Mansfield frequently stayed home while his wife Sarah loved to dress up and go into town. Charles eventually discovered secret letters from Sarah's admirers and filed for divorce. First marriage Sarah Mansfield sailed to California after her divorce, and rented a house on Bryant Street in San Francisco with her daughter Josie. James D. Carter was the owner of the property adjoining Mansfield's. Carter had a transport business and had accumulated a fortune. He became infatuated with Josie Mansfield, and he proposed marriage. Her mother objected because of her daughter's age. Carter proposed that Josie Mansfield should go to the convent of Notre Dame at San Jose, about fifty miles from San Francisco, and finish her education. He offered to pay her expenses until she was of age, and then marry her. Mansfield was sent to the convent. Her mother married a professional gambler named Richard Warren. Mansfield left her boarding school and returned to her mother. In San Francisco, Mansfield met Frank Lawlor, an actor, who was then performing at the San Francisco Opera House. D. W. Perley, the wealthy English law partner of Judge David S. Terry, began calling at the Warren home, and became attracted to Mansfield. According to Goldsmith, Richard Warren \\"forced her to have intercourse with...Perley, after which he popped out from under the bed, pointed a loaded pistol at Perley's head, and demanded $500.\\" Perley went to the bank after his escape and stopped payment of the check. At Perley's instigation, the San Francisco newspapers published the details of the event, describing it as a conspiracy between the Lawlors and the Warrens. Lawlor claimed to have been in Virginia City, Nevada at the time of the Perley incident. When he returned to San Francisco, Mansfield told him all about it, and begged him for protection from her stepfather. According to Lawlor, Mansfield insisted that he marry her. Mansfield and Lawlor married on September 1, 1864, when Mansfield was 16. In January 1865, the couple left San Francisco. The Lawlors moved to Washington, DC, and Philadelphia before settling in New York. They separated, and after several months, they divorced in 1866. Mansfield tried to make it as an actor, but failed to find work. Relationship with Jim Fisk By 1867, Josie Mansfield had become so impoverished that she had only one presentable dress and despaired of ever paying the overdue rent on her tiny room on Lexington Avenue. She began spending time at the home of her friend Annie Wood on 34th Street. There, in November 1867, she met Jim Fisk, a wealthy financier who was known for handing out $100 bills to women who caught his eye. Mansfield rebuffed Fisk's advances and refused his money for three months, increasing his desire for her and her value. Then she allowed him to pay her overdue rent, after which he moved her into the American Club Hotel suite. Fisk eventually bought Mansfield an elegant home at 18 West 24th, furnished it, and supplied her with everything she desired. The four-story brownstone (after some $65,000 worth of improvements) had four servants, a wardrobe filled with dresses, and a jewelry case accented by real jewels. The home was a few doors down from Fisk's Grand Opera House and Erie Railroad headquarters at 359 W. 23rd, and Fisk had a covered passage built linking the back doors of the headquarters and Mansfield's brownstone. In January 1868, just three months after meeting him, Mansfield visited Fisk at his Erie Railroad offices. The visit provoked a rebuke from Fisk: \\"Strange you should make my office or the vicinity the scene for a 'personal.' You must be aware that harm came to me in such foolish vanity, and those that could do it care but little for the interest of the writer of this.\\" In addition to the dresses, Fisk gave Mansfield $50,000 in cash and about $250,000 in Tiffany emeralds. Mansfield had her hair done daily, and every two weeks she had a skin treatment of bismuth and arsenic to keep her skin white. In one year, Fisk spent $30,000 to equip Mansfield. Besides the emeralds, he gave her a diamond necklace, earrings, and tiara, pearls, corals, medallions, and 25 rings. In November 1868, nine months after they met, the Springfield (Massachusetts) Republican published an expos√© of Fisk's relationship with Mansfield. Relationship with Ned Stokes Wallach Division: Print Collection. Helen Josephine Mansfield, 1872 Edward \\"Ned\\" Stokes operated an oil refinery in Brooklyn at Hunter's Point. Fisk, who operated the Erie Railroad, was Stokes' \\"silent partner\\" and had a secret arrangement with Stokes to discount freight charges for the refinery. On New Year's Day, 1870, Mansfield hosted an open house. Fisk invited Stokes to join him at the party and there introduced him to Mansfield. Stokes became a frequent visitor to Mansfield's home. Mansfield likely tried to extort money from Fisk with the threat of ending their relationship and deserting him for Stokes. Fisk resisted giving her a settlement. On January 29, 1870, Josie sent Fisk a letter ending their relationship. Fisk went to Stokes to request that Stokes stop seeing Mansfield. Stokes favored letting Mansfield decide between them. Mansfield declined to decide, stating that she didn't see why they couldn't all be friends. Fisk replied that \\"You can't run two engines on one track in contrary directions at the same time.\\" Mansfield and Fisk made up and broke up again. Fisk began spending time with C√©line Montaland, a French soprano, and Fisk was aware that Mansfield was still seeing Stokes. Because she was unable to extort money from Fisk herself, Mansfield delivered their love letters to Stokes. Several lawsuits took place between the three parties, and Fisk was prosecuted for libel by Mansfield, because he had a former servant of hers make an affidavit that he overheard Mansfield and Stokes conspiring to get money from Fisk. In January 1871, Fisk arranged to have Stokes arrested for embezzling funds from the refinery. He also took over the refinery by force and obtained injunctions to prevent Stokes and his mother, who owned the site, from entering the premises. The charge was dismissed and Stokes was later awarded $10,000 compensation. Stokes was dissatisfied with the award and threatened to publish incriminating letters from Fisk unless he was paid substantially more. Fisk obtained another injunction to prevent the publication, claiming he was being blackmailed. On January 6, 1872, Stokes learned that Fisk was on his way to the Grand Central Hotel. He knew that Fisk always entered by the ladies entrance, so Stokes went in first and waited on the second floor landing. When he heard Fisk climbing the stairs, Stokes started down. Stokes fired two shots at Fisk from a Colt pistol, hitting him once in the abdomen and once in the left arm. Stokes tried to flee but was captured. Fisk died of the abdominal wound the next morning after giving a dying declaration identifying Stokes as the killer. Aftermath of murder Thirty-nine letters from Fisk to Mansfield were published in the New York Herald one week after Jim Fisk's death. They contained no insight into Fisk's business dealings, just evidence of his love for Mansfield and his jealousy of Stokes. Mansfield sued Fisk's widow for $200,000 that she claimed Fisk owed her, but she lost the suit. Mansfield went to Boston, where crowds followed her and hooted her in the streets. On the morning of July 22, 1872, Mansfield went to Saratoga, New York to testify in the Court of Impeachment concerning Fisk's relations with Judge George G. Barnard. She was refused accommodation at the Grand Union Hotel and at least one other first-class hotel in the city. When she took a seat in the courtroom, several local women walked out. In September 1872, Mansfield applied for a passport. Her passport application describes her as tall, with a high forehead, an aquiline nose, a small mouth, dark brown hair, a light complexion, and an oval face. Relationship with Ella Wesner In 1873, Mansfield left New York for Paris with Ella Wesner, a male impersonator in Vaudeville. The event evoked considerable scandal; it was discussed in most of the major metropolitan newspapers and journals in New York, Chicago, and other major American cities. Mansfield and Wesner went to Paris and presided over a salon at the Caf√© Am√©rican. Wesner returned to the United States alone in the spring of 1873. Mid life On September 4, 1873, Mansfield was being treated for life-threatening cancer in Paris. On November 27, 1874, Mansfield returned to New York on the Parthia from Liverpool, England. On May 19, 1888, The New York Times reported that Mansfield was dead and had been secretly buried in Beverly, New Jersey, but a reporter tracked her down at her residence near the Boulevard Pereire in Paris. Her auburn hair was reportedly wound in a graceful knot upon the top of her head. The 1891 U.S. $1,000 silver certificate, known as the Courtesan Note, depicts the image of a woman that was based on a photograph of Josie Mansfield. Second marriage In October 1891, Mansfield married Robert Livingstone Reade, an expatriate American lawyer, at St George's church, Hanover Square, London. Reade was a brother of Katherine Strachan, Lady Falkland. His mother and three members of the bride's family were present at the wedding. The couple spent their honeymoon at Brighton. They divorced on August 1, 1895. Josie was living at 53 Rue Empere, Paris, and Robert was living at the Hotel Brighton. Later life During her later life, several stories appeared in newspapers claiming that Mansfield was sick and poor and living with siblings, although she was an only child. One story claimed that Mansfield lived in Boston from 1896 to 1899, calling herself \\"Mrs. Josie Welton.\\" The same article claimed that Mansfield was paralyzed on her right side, and was going to live with her \\"sister\\" in Philadelphia. Another article claimed that from 1902 through 1909, Mansfield was living as \\"Mrs. Mary Lawler\\" with a \\"brother\\" in Watertown, South Dakota.

Bred by the leading jockey Frankie Dettori he had a flat racing career of limited importance, winning two minor races from nine starts as a three-year-old in 2011. He showed better form when switched to hurdles, winning the Sharp Novices' Hurdle in 2012. He proved even better when he began to compete in steeplechases, winning the November Novices' Chase and the Wayward Lad Novices' Chase in 2013. In the 2014/2015 National Hunt season he emerged as one of the best chasers in Britain, recording three consecutive Grade 1 wins in the Tingle Creek Chase, Clarence House Chase and Queen Mother Champion Chase. Background Dodging Bullets is a bay gelding with a white star and two white socks bred in the United Kingdom by Frankie Dettori. He was sired by Dubawi a top-class son of Dubai Millennium, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly-successful breeding stallion, siring major flat winners such as Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Lucky Nine and Poet's Voice. Dodging Bullets' dam Nova Cyngi, was an unraced daughter of the Prix Vermeille winner Northern Trick, whose other descendants include Main Sequence and Light Shift. In November 2009, the yearling Dodging Bullets was sent to the Tattersalls sales and was bought for 8,000 guineas by the Irish trainer Andrew Oliver. The horse entered the ownership of R A Pegum and was trained by Oliver at Caledon, County Tyrone. Racing career2011: three-year-old season= Dodging Bullets began his racing career in a maiden race over one mile at Cork Racecourse on 13 May when he finished seventh of the seventeen runners at odds of 50/1. He failed to win in his next six races, consisting of maiden races and minor handicaps in Ireland before winning a handicap race over eight and a half furlongs at Galway Races on 27 July. On his final appearance on the flat, he won a ten furlong handicap at Sligo Racecourse in August. At the end of the year, Dodging Bullets was sold and sent to England to be trained for a National Hunt career by Paul Nicholls. =2011/2012 National Hunt season: novice hurdles= On his first appearance over hurdles he was immediately entered against good-class opposition when he contested the Grade 2 Dovecote Novices' Hurdle at Kempton Park Racecourse on 25 February. Ridden by Ruby Walsh he started at odds of 9/2 and finished second of the six runners, one and a half lengths behind the odds-on favourite Grumeti. In the following month, Dodging Bullets was sent to the Cheltenham Festival for the first time and started a 20/1 outsider for the Triumph Hurdle in which he was ridden by Daryl Jacob. He finished fourth of the twenty runners behind Countrywide Flame, Hisaabaat and Grumeti. On his third and final appearance of the season, he finished sixth behind Grumeti in the Anniversary 4-Y-O Novices' Hurdle after being badly hampered at the fifth hurdle. =2012/2013 National Hunt season: novice hurdles= As he had failed to win in his three races in the spring of 2012, Dodging Bullets remained eligible to compete in novice hurdle races in the 2012/2013 National Hunt season. On his seasonal debut on 20 October, he recorded his first jump race win in a novice hurdle at Cheltenham, taking the lead approaching the last and going clear of his rivals to win by eight lengths at odds of 10/11. On 16 November the gelding was moved up in class for the Grade 2 Sharp Novices' Hurdle at the same course and started 5/4 favourite against seven opponents. Ridden by Ruby Walsh, he led from the start and survived a mistake at the last flight of hurdles to win by one and a half lengths from River Maigue. The gelding was stepped up again in class and matched against more experienced hurdlers when he contested the Grade 1 Christmas Hurdle at Kempton on 26 December. He stayed on in the closing stages to finish third behind Darlan and Raya Star, and ahead of Countrywide Flame, Cinders and Ashes (winner of the Supreme Novices' Hurdle) and Punjabi. Dodging Bullets went to the Cheltenham for the festival again in March 2013 and started at odds of 12/1 for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. After moving up to challenge the leaders three hurdles from the finish he weakened badly in the closing stages and finished ninth, fifty lengths behind the winner Champagne Fever. He was moved up in distance for the Mersey Novices' Hurdle over two and a half miles at Aintree Racecourse in April, but again ran poorly and came home last of the seven finishers behind Ubak. =2013/2014 National Hunt season: novice chases= In the 2013/2014 National Hunt season, Dodging Bullets competed in novice steeplechases. On his debut over the larger obstacles, he started 8/11 favourite for a minor event at Kempton on 20 October and won by four lengths after taking the lead at the tenth of the twelve fences. In the following month he was matched against Raya Star and the County Hurdle winner Ted Veale in the November Novices' Chase at Cheltenham. Ridden by Jacob, he took the lead after the penultimate fence and won by five lengths from Raya Star with Ted Veale another three and a quarter lengths back in third. On 27 December he started 7/4 second favourite behind the odds-on Grandouet (whose wins included the Champion Four Year Old Hurdle and the International Hurdle) in the Grade 2 Wayward Lad Novices' Chase over two miles at Kempton. Dodging Bullets tracked Grandouet before taking the lead four fences from the finish and drew away to win by ten lengths. Dodging Bullets took on more experienced chasers in the Grade 2 Game Spirit Chase at Newbury Racecourse in February and finished second, beaten a neck by the seven-year- old favourite Module. On his third appearance at the Cheltenham Festival, Dodging Bullets started the 6/1 fourth choice in the betting (behind Champagne Fever, Trifolium and Rock On Ruby) for the Grade 1 Arkle Challenge Trophy and finished fourth, beaten five lengths by the 33/1 outsider Western Warhorse. On his final appearance of the season, the gelding again ran poorly at Aintree, finishing last of five behind Uxizandre in the Manifesto Novices' Chase. =2014/2015 National Hunt season: steeplechases= On his first appearance of the 2014/2015 season Dodging Bullets finished third behind Uxizandre and Simply Ned in the Shloer Chase at Cheltenham on 16 November. On 6 December, the gelding was moved up in class for the Grade 1 Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown Park Racecourse. He started at odds of 9/1 in a ten-runner field which also included Balder (Maghull Novices' Chase), God's Own (Ryanair Novice Chase, Haldon Gold Cup), Oscar Whisky and Somersby (Clarence House Chase). Ridden by Sam Twiston-Davies he tracked the leaders before moving up to take second place at the ninth fence. He took the lead approaching the last fence and won by two and a half lengths from Somersby. Dodging Bullets' next race was the Grade 1 Clarence House Chase at Ascot Racecourse on 17 January in which he started 7/2 second favourite behind the nine-year-old Sprinter Sacre, who was returning after a long break caused by health problems. Ridden by Noel Fehily, he settled in third place as Somersby led before Sprinter Sacre moved up to lead at the second last. Dodging Bullets overtook Sprinter Sacre approaching the last and won by three lengths with the Irish challenger Twinlight (winner of the Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase) a further five lengths back in third. On 11 March 2015, Dodging Bullets contested the 56th running of the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He started the 9/2 third choice in the betting behind Sprinter Sacre (winner of the race in 2013) and the 2014 winner Sire de Grugy. The other contenders included Somersby, Simply Ned, the thirteen-year-old Irish veteran Sizing Europe, the Game Spirit Chase winner Mr Mole and the Desert Orchid Chase winner Special Tiara. Sam Twiston-Davies positioned the gelding in second as Special Tiara led from the start and opened up a clear advantage. Dodging Bullets moved up to challenge at the third last and took the lead at the final fence. On the run-in he got the better of Special Tiara and held off the challenge of Somersby to win by one and a quarter lengths. Special Tiara was a length and three quarters back in third, seven lengths clear of Sire de Grugy.

The champion of the tournament received an automatic bid to the 2015 NCAA Tournament. Format Unlike most Division I conference tournaments in basketball, the Big Sky tournament did not involve all of the conference's teams. With the addition of Idaho to the conference for the 2014‚Äì15 season, expanding the number of teams from 11 to 12, the tournament expanded from seven teams to eight. As in previous years, qualifying is based on overall conference record. The number of teams that failed to qualify stayed at four. All tournament games were played at the site of the regular-season champion. The women's tournament ran this year with a Wednesday-Friday-Saturday format because Montana hosted both tournaments, having won the women's regular-season title outright and earned men's hosting rights by winning a tiebreaker with regular-season co-champion Eastern Washington. With the move to an 8-seed schedule, the Big Sky also chose to go with the regular 8-seed tournament most other conferences use. The 2015 tournament was the last to be held at campus sites, and the last in which certain teams were excluded for poor performance. Starting with the 2015‚Äì16 season, the Big Sky men's and women's tournaments both expanded to include all conference members (barring NCAA sanctions or self-imposed postseason bans), and both tournaments will be held at a predetermined neutral site.

He was associated with a number of surgical innovations including excision of the knee joint, excision of the thyroid and excision of the larynx for malignant disease. He was President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on two occasions, an unusual honour, and was the first President of the Edinburgh Dental Hospital. He was a great advocate of women training in medicine and surgery and did much to advance that cause.  Early life  He was born in Edinburgh on 5 January 1832, the third of four sons of Rev Dr Charles Watson of Burntisland and Isabella Boog. His brothers were Rev Robert Boog Watson, Rev Charles Watson, and David Watson (a businessman). The family moved permanently to Edinburgh around 1840, living on Calton Hill: first at 19 Royal Terrace then in 1850 moving to 13 Carlton Terrace.Edinburgh Post Office Directories 1840 to 1850 He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and then studied medicine at Edinburgh University. During this time both Joseph Lister and John Beddoe were fellow students and friends. He graduated MD in 1853 with the thesis \\"On traumatic gangrene\\" and was elected Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He served as house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh under Professor James Spence. In July 1855 (whilst in the Crimea) he was elected FRCSEd.  Crimea  In December 1854 he travelled south to Chatham Dockyard to enlist as an assistant surgeon in the Royal Artillery, specifically hoping to gain experience in military surgery, a standard requirement for Professorship. The Crimean War had just begun and intended to serve his country there. He left Chatham on 15 January 1855 with eight other surgeons, travelling to Crimea via Marseilles and Valletta, their ship arriving at Constantinople on 26 January. His hospital was one of the three main hospitals serving the British troops: Scutari, just two miles from Constantinople and famed for its connection to Florence Nightingale. This he found nightmarish, and was pleased to be reposted to the hill hospital at Koolalee. This, however, had a far higher mortality rate, running at around 25%. On 11 April he reported his first bout of typhus, and moved to a hotel in Therapia to convalesce, returning to Koolalee in early May 1855. He determined to move to a field hospital, closer to the war itself in Crimea, and in June travelled to Balaklava, and from there to a field hospital called Castle Hospital where he began work on 25 June. Here seventy patients were treated, under an Irish doctor named Jephson. He enjoyed six weeks here before being posted to a forward field hospital attached to the Royal artillery near Karane. In August 1855 he had a severe attack of dysentery and on 13 August he was placed on a ship, Imperador, to carry him back to the hospital at Scutari. As a strange coincidence, here he was able to share a room with his brother Robert who had also caught dysentery whilst serving as chaplain with the Highland Brigade. Florence Nightingale wrote him a letter of apology as she was unable to her own illness at the time. He spent 4 weeks being treated but made little progress. He was placed on the ship the Earl of Shaftesbury to be returned home. He stayed a month in Valletta in Malta en route. Then took the steamship Transit back to Portsmouth in England. On 19 October he reached London. He thought he would be returned to the Crimea once well, but never returned.  Later life  Watson completed his military service at Woolwich and Aldershot, continuing in his role of Surgeon to the Royal Artillery. He recovered and returned to Edinburgh to teach surgery at the university, that department then being based at High School Yards. Although he had hoped to become Professor of Military Surgery that role was abandoned in 1856. He also lectured at the Extramural School of Medicine at Surgeons' Hall. In the Royal Infirmary he acted as assistant to the Professor of Surgery James Miller, whose daughter Elizabeth he married. On Miller's death Heron Watson took on his father-in-law's large and lucrative practice. In 1860, over and above his academic role, he took on the role of assistant surgeon at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. In 1863 he was promoted to full surgeon, a role he then held for 15 years. During this time, he was one of Arthur Conan Doyle's teachers along with Joseph Bell, who ultimately became the inspirations for Dr. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively. From 1865 to 1904 he was also a surgeon at Chalmers Hospital in Edinburgh (just west of the Royal Infirmary). In the admission period of autumn 1870 he was one of the first to permit women to attend his extra mural classes in surgery. He stood alone in this role for sixteen years until his pupil, Sophia Jex-Blake, opened a college specifically for women. In 1877 he stood for the chair of Clinical Surgery in Edinburgh University, but was beaten (alleged due to his opposition to specialisation) by Thomas Annandale. Nevertheless, he holds an important part in the history of surgery, making advances both in thyroid excision, excision of the knee joint, amputation and in abdominal operations. However, as with many contemporaries he was not a follower of his former student companion, Joseph Lister's use of antiseptic, and as a result, many simple procedures ended in failure. In 1879 he helped to found the Edinburgh Dental Hospital, also being one of its directors. Here, too, he encouraged female students to join, with Lillian Lindsay becoming the first woman to graduate in Dentistry in the UK (1895). He also had long-running disputes with other Edinburgh medical figures, such as Henry Littlejohn. He was elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1878 and again in 1905. On the latter occasion this was to enable him to be President during the College's quatercentenary celebrations, a sign of the esteem in which he was held by the Fellows. He was Honorary Surgeon in Scotland, both to Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. He was knighted by the latter in 1903. After a six-month illness, he died at his home at 16 Charlotte Square, on 21 December 1907 and was buried in Dean Cemetery on the west side of Edinburgh.British Medical Journal: Obituaries 4 January 1908 His collection of pathological specimens was passed to the Royal College of Surgeons and now forms part of their collection.  Family  In 1861 he married Elizabeth Gordon Miller, eldest daughter of his mentor, Prof James Miller (1812‚Äì1864). She died in Gotha, Germany, on 27 February 1900. They had two sons: Charles Heron Watson FRCS (1871‚Äì1959) and James Miller Watson (1879‚Äì1958). They also had two daughters, one of whom, Penelope Gordon Watson, married the surgeon James Haig Ferguson FRSE. His nephew was Charles Boog Watson FRSE.
