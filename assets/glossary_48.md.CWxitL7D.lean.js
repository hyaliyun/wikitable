Alongside Anne Dieu-le-Veut, she was one of very few 17th-century female pirates. There is no evidence from period sources that Delahaye was a real person. Stories of her exploits are attributed to Leon Treich, a French fiction writer of the 1940s. Biography Delahaye reportedly came from Saint-Domingue in modern Haiti, and was the daughter of a French father and a Haitian mother, and spoke French. Her mother is said to have died while giving birth to her brother, who suffered mild mental disability, and was left in her care after her father's death. According to legend and tradition, she became a pirate after the murder of her father. Jacquotte Delahaye is the subject of many legendary stories. To escape her pursuers, she faked her own death and took on a male alias, living as a man for many years. Upon her return, she became known as \\"Back From the Dead Red\\" because of her striking red hair. She led a gang of hundreds of pirates, and with their help took over a small Caribbean island in the year of 1656, which was called a \\"freebooter republic\\".Global Interactions in the Early Modern Age, 1400‚Äì1800.

Extensive studies and plans for the new system were completed in 2007 and presented to the Minneapolis City Council in January 2008; on April 2, 2010, the Council voted to approve the plans and seek funding. On December 21, 2010 the Federal Transit Administration granted $900,000 to further study the Nicollet and Central Avenue corridors. Streetcar vs Light rail Based on similar federal funded streetcar programs in the USA (mainly Portland, Oregon) streetcars are rarely separated from other traffic and are not given traffic-signal priority over other vehicles (like Light rail), except in a few situations to allow the rail cars‚Äîwhich cannot turn as sharply as most other motor vehicles‚Äîto make some turns. In Portland, using this \\"mixed traffic\\" operation has reduced the cost of constructing each segment and‚Äîby not closing traffic lanes permanently to other traffic, as is typically done with light rail‚Äîalso minimized disruption to traffic flow, and allows curbside parking to be retained, but also means slower operating speeds compared to light rail. Additional factors making the Portland Streetcar line less expensive to build per mile than light rail are that use of city streets largely eliminated the need to acquire private property for portions of the right-of-way, as has been necessary for the region's light rail lines, and that the vehicles' smaller size and therefore lighter weight has enabled the use of a \\"shallower track slab\\". The latter means that construction of the trackway necessitated excavating to a depth of only instead of the conventional (for light rail) depth of around , significantly reducing the extent to which previously existing underground utilities had to be relocated to accommodate the trackway. Vehicles Each Portland streetcar is long, whereas light rail cars are typically long (Portland's Lightrail are between . long) and streetcars are operated as single cars at all times, never coupled into trains. The shorter cars keeps station construction expense lower than would be the case for a light-rail station, but the smaller cars do not provide equal carrying capacity as that of a light-rail train. A single articulated Portland streetcar is only about one-third the length of a two-car Lightrail Trains. It can be assumed that the Minneapolis streetcars would follow similar design standards or acquire ex- Twin City Rapid Transit PCC streetcars from Newark City Subway. Examples of Portland streetcars: File:United Streetcar 10T3 prototype for Portland.jpgUnited Streetcar 10T3 prototype for Portland. United Streetcar dissolved in 2015. File:PortlandStreetcar5.jpg≈†koda 10 T in Portland How to Ride The streetcars would cost either as much as METRO light rail ($2.00 non-rush hour, $2.50 rush hour) or slightly less due to slower travel speeds ($2.05 all day-like Portland). Discounted fares for disabled riders and veterans would also apply. Ticket boxes would be the same ones used at METRO light rail and Northstar Commuter Rail stations, and would accept day, event 6 hour, metro, U, college, and student passes, as well as super savers. Click to go to the Metro Transit website and learn more about these fares. Metro Transit website Use of Nextrip signs would also be used at the stations, to allow riders to determine the time of the next arriving train or bus at the station. The streetcars would be operated by Metro Transit a division of the Metropolitan Council. Lines The current plans include five lines, which with the exception of the Midtown Greenway line follow former Twin City Rapid Transit streetcar routes that were removed in the early 1950s. It appears that the Nicollet Ave/Central Ave Line would be the first line to be built, due to its importance in helping revitalize both Northeast and South Minneapolis =Nicollet Avenue/Central Avenue Line= This line would run along Nicollet Avenue, Nicollet Mall and Central Avenue NE (Minnesota State Highway 65) from 46th Street South through Downtown Minneapolis (connecting to the METRO Blue and Green lines at Nicollet Mall Station) to the Columbia Heights Transit Center in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. The line would cross the Mississippi River via the Third Avenue Bridge. There is an at-grade railroad crossing at 36th Avenue NE that would have to be altered to ensure steady traffic flow for the streetcars. Other than the railroad crossing, there are no major construction or engineering issues along the corridor. The total length of the line would be . The cost of track for the line would be approximately $185 million. Ridership estimates for the line are around 14,500 to 17,500 weekday riders. Compared to the 30,500 riders per weekday on the 12.3 mile Blue Line from Target Field in Downtown Minneapolis to Mall of America. Travel time from the I-35W & 46th St. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Station to the Columbia Heights Transit Center would be approximately 35 minutes. The route follows the northern leg of TCRT's Bloomington‚ÄìColumbia Heights line and southern leg of TCRT's Nicollet‚ÄìNorthwest line. =Midtown Greenway/Lake Street Line= This line would run along Lake Street between St. Louis Park & Hiawatha Avenue, connecting the future proposed Green Line extension, METRO Blue Line and several major housing sites together. Although TCRT streetcars never ran along the rail corridor that is now the Midtown Greenway, the Minneapolis leg of the Selby-Lake line ran one block south on Lake Street. =Hennepin Avenue/University/4th Street Line= This line would run from downtown along Hennepin Avenue from the Uptown Transit Center through Downtown Minneapolis (connecting with the METRO Blue and Green lines at Warehouse District / Hennepin Avenue Station) to University Avenue, continuing east to Oak Street. The line would cross the Mississippi River on the Hennepin Avenue Bridge. The line would be long. The track would cost approximately $80 million. Ridership estimates for the line are approximately 9,500 to 12,000 weekday riders. The route follows the TCRT's Oak‚ÄìHarriet line. =Broadway/Washington Avenue Line= This line would run along West Broadway (Hennepin County Road 81) and Washington Avenue from the Robbinsdale Transit Center to Nicollet Mall in Downtown Minneapolis. The line would be long. The track would cost approximately $135 million. Estimated ridership for the line would be approximately 4,500 to 5,500 weekday riders. The route follows TCRT's 28th Ave‚ÄìRobbinsdale line. =Chicago Avenue Line= This line would run along Chicago Avenue from 38th Street South to Nicollet Mall in Downtown Minneapolis via 9th and 10th streets. The line would then run along Nicollet Mall to 5th Street. It would terminate at Nicollet Mall Station on the METRO Blue and Green lines. The line would be long. The cost of track for the line would be approximately $80 million. Ridership estimates for this line are approximately 11,000 to 13,000 riders on weekdays. The route follows the southern leg of TCRT's Chicago‚ÄìPenn line.

He died of wounds he received at the Battle of Waterloo. Early life De Lancey's ancestors were Huguenots who had emigrated from Caen, France to America following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. His grandmother Phila Franks De Lancey was an Ashkenazi Jew. Born in New York City, De Lancey was the only son of Stephen De Lancey (1748‚Äì1798), who was clerk of the city and county of Albany in 1765, lieutenant-colonel of the 1st New Jersey loyal volunteers in 1782, afterwards chief justice of the Bahamas, and in 1796 governor of Tobago; and who married Cornelia, daughter of the Rev. H. Barclay of Trinity Church, New York. He was the grandson of Major-General Oliver De Lancey Sr. (1708‚Äì1785) and a great- grandson of Etienne de Lancey, who became known as Stephen Delancey (1663‚Äì1741). He married in Edinburgh, on 4 April 1815, Magdalene (1793‚Äì1822), one of the three daughters of Sir James Hall of Dunglass, fourth baronet (1761‚Äì1832), and his wife Lady Helen Douglas (1762‚Äì1837), a daughter of Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk. De Lancey and Magdalene had no issue. De Lancey's father, Stephen, and many other members of the De Lancey family of New York, were supporters of King George III during the American Revolution. The United States and Great Britain signed the Treaty of Paris officially ending the war in 1783, and as a result the De Lancey property was confiscated and the family was forced to flee to England. A number of De Lanceys and their friends, including Stephen's family, moved to Beverley, Yorkshire, where William Howe De Lancey attended Beverley Grammar School. The family later resided in London. William attended Harrow School from 12 December 1789 until December 1791. In 1798, his father, who was serving as Governor of Tobago, died at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, while travelling to England to rejoin his family. Early military service De Lancey obtained a cornetcy in the 16th Light Dragoons on 7 July 1792, and was promoted Lieutenant on 26 February 1793. His name appears in the returns for a short time as adjutant at Sheffield. He purchased an independent company on 25 March 1794 and was transferred to the newly raised 80th Regiment of Foot, which he accompanied to the East Indies in 1795. On 20 October 1796 he was transferred to a troop in the 17th Light Dragoons, of which his uncle, General Oliver De Lancey, was then colonel, but appears to have remained some time after in the East Indies. In 1799 he was in command of a detached troop of the 17th Light Dragoons in Kent, and on 17 October in that year was appointed major in the 45th Regiment of Foot, the headquarters of which were then in the West Indies. He appears to have been detained on service in Europe until the return home of the regiment, soon after which, in 1802, he was transferred to the permanent staff of the quartermaster-general's department as deputy-assistant quartermaster-general. No departmental record of his services is extant. Peninsular War De Lancey was stationed for some time at York and in Ireland, and afterwards proceeded to Spain, and as assistant quartermaster-general, and later as deputy quartermaster-general, with various divisions of the Peninsular Army, rendered valuable service throughout the campaigns from 1809 to 1814. He was mentioned in despatches for his conduct at the passage of the Douro and capture of Oporto in 1809; cites: Gurwood, iii. 229. at the siege and capture of Ciudad Rodrigo in 1811; Cites: Gurwood, v. 476. and at the Battle of Vittoria in 1813, when he was deputy quartermaster-general with Sir Thomas Graham. Cites: Gurwood, vi. 542. After the peace he was created K.C.B. On 4 April 1815 he married Magdalene, second daughter of Sir James Hall, 4th Baronet of Dunglass, and sister of Captain Basil Hall. Waterloo Campaign On the return of Napoleon Bonaparte from Elba, De Lancey was appointed deputy quartermaster- general of the army in Belgium, replacing Sir Hudson Lowe, whom the Duke of Wellington disliked. He arrived in Brussels on 9 May. From the moment news reached Wellington that the French had crossed the border De Lancey was busy. Although invited, he and his wife, who had arrived a day or two before, were unable to go to the Duchess of Richmond's ball. On the 17th when the allied army retreated from Quatre Bras to Waterloo he allocated the positions that the troops were to occupy by ordering stakes placed in the ground where the regiments were to be for the next day's battle, which according to S. G. P. Ward writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography was \\"to the rear, apparently, of the ground originally chosen by the duke\\". On 18 June 1815, during the Battle of Waterloo, while he was talking to the Duke of Wellington, De Lancey was struck in the back by a ricocheting cannonball leaving his skin unbroken but causing fatal internal injuries. Believing him dead, Wellington wrote in his dispatch of the battle that his death was \\"a serious loss to His Majesty's service, and to me\\". The Duke of Wellington gave the following version of the occurrence to Samuel Rogers: De Lancey was taken to a peasant's cottage in the village of Waterloo, where, after a delay of 24 hours due to the misinformation that he was dead, he was tenderly nursed by his young wife. A week later, on 26 June, he succumbed to his injuries, which included eight broken ribs. cites: Rogers, who in a note states that he was killed by \\"the wind of the shot\\", his skin not being broken. Magdalene de Lancey left a manuscript account of his last days, which was published in 1906 under the title of A Week at Waterloo in June 1815. De Lancey was buried in the Saint Josse Ten Noode cemetery, on the Louvain road, a mile from Brussels, and when that cemetery was destroyed in 1889 his remains were reinterred in the crypt under the British Waterloo Campaign Monument in the cemetery of Evere, three miles north-east of Brussels. > \\"Fair lady's love, and splendid fame, De Lancey did enthral. His loyal heart > alike they claim, They sigh to see him fall.\\" Family Magdalene de Lancey married again in 1817 Captain Henry Harvey, Madras infantry, who retired in 1821. She died in 1822 giving birth to her third child.

The 12th convention was held at KolkataRamananda Chatterjee: The Modern Review (Calcutta), vol 57 ; The Modern Review Office, Calcutta (1935), page 141 in Dec 1934. Post Independence, in 1953 the coinage 'Prabasi' was dropped and 'Nikhil Bharat' (All India) was adopted in the context of the free nation. Objectives of the conference Delegates from all over the country meet to hold thematic discussions, meet Bengali authors, novelists, and poets, attend literary sessions, exchange thoughts with people of other languages, and enjoy cultural evenings. Current scope Under the patronization of great Bengali literary personalities like Atul Prasad Sen, Kazi Nazrul Islam and others, the Sammelan has reached maturity, having branches every major city and town of India. Its activity of serving Bengali literature and Bengali culture outside Bengal has spread over almost all the states of India. The central office of the organization is located at Kali Bari, Mandir Marg, New Delhi-110001. The organisation publishes a regular Bengali journal called 'Sammelani' and various other books related to Bengali literature and culture. It organizes cultural and literary programmes throughout the year. The annual convention is held every year in different parts of the country. The idea is to enrich Bengali literature and its culture by exchanging views and resources with other Indian authors.

Development of DQI was started by the Construction Industry Council (CIC) in 1999.Page 6, Spencer, N. and Winch, G. (2002). How Buildings add value for clients, London: Thomas Telford. It was initiated in response to the success of Key Performance Indicators devised for assessing construction process issues such as timely completion, financial control and safety on site by the construction industry's Movement for Innovation (M4I). The aim of the DQI systems was to ensure that the M4I's indicators of construction process were balanced by an assessment of the building as a product.Macmillan, S. (2004) Preface to Designing Better Buildings: quality and value in the built environment, London: Spon Press.

DQI Online ‚Äì How well is your building designed? 1 October 2003 In 2004 the DQI received recognition from the British Institute of Facilities Management for the role of involving users in the design process. The DQI tool was made available to users in the United States in 2006, and an online American version was launched on 20 October 2008. Unlike its forerunner the Housing Quality Indicator (HQI) system devised for the UK's Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) by the consultancy DEGW and published on open access in February 1999, Wheeler, P.

The criteria and the method of assessment, which though unacknowledged is a simple form of multi-attribute utility analysis, remained inaccessible to design teams and their clients unless they employed a facilitator licensed to use it. Guidance on using the HQI system can be found on the government website. The DQI version for hospitals is also on open access on the national archive.http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130124042007/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_082085.pdf Conceptual framework DQI applies a structured approach to assess design quality based on the model by the architect Vitruvius, the Roman author of the earliest surviving theoretical treatise on building in Western culture, who described design in terms of utilitas, firmitas and venustas, often translated as commodity, firmness and delight.Gann et al. (2003), Design Quality Indicator as a tool for thinking: Building Research and Information, London: Spon Press. DQI uses a modern-day interpretation of these terms as: *Functionality (utilitas) ‚Äì the arrangement, quality and interrelationship of spaces and how the building is designed to be useful to all. *Build Quality (firmitas) ‚Äì the engineering performance of the building, which includes structural stability and the integration, safety and robustness of the systems, finishes and fittings. *Impact (venustas) ‚Äì the building‚Äôs ability to create a sense of place and have a positive effect on the local community and environment. Methodology DQI is completed by a range of stakeholders in the briefing and design stages of a building project, or on a completed building. Stakeholders who participate include: *Architects *Building users (or potential users) *Building clients *Facilities managers (or future facilities managers) *Project managers *Quantity surveyors (Cost engineer) *Structural and building services engineers DQI is applied in a facilitated workshop that is led by a certified DQI facilitator. Models and related approaches There are three models of design quality indicator: *DQI which is applicable to all building types *DQI for schools which is applicable to school buildings. This model of DQI is being used on all current school projects in the UKConstruction Industry Council. DQI for Schools Launched 8 December 2005 and forms part of the Department for Children, Schools and Families 'Minimum Design Standard' for new school buildings.Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment.

The Blue Stockings Society was an informal women's social and educational movement in England in the mid-18th century. The society emphasised education and mutual co-operation. The Society was founded in the early 1750s by Elizabeth Montagu, Elizabeth Vesey and others, as a women's literary discussion group, a revolutionary step away from traditional, non- intellectual, women's activities. They invited various people (both women and men) to attend, including botanist, translator and publisher Benjamin Stillingfleet. One story tells that Stillingfleet was not rich enough to have the proper formal dress, which included black silk stockings and so he attended in everyday blue worsted stockings. The term came to refer to the informal quality of the gatherings and the emphasis on conversation over fashion. History The centre house, 16 Royal Crescent, Bath, was used as a residence and to host Blue Stockings Society events by Elizabeth Montagu The Blue Stockings Society of England emerged in about 1750, and waned in popularity at the end of the 18th century. It was a loose organization of privileged women with an interest in education to gather together to discuss literature while inviting educated men to participate. The Blue Stockings Society leaders and hostesses were Elizabeth Montagu and Elizabeth Vesey. The women involved in this group generally had more education and fewer children than most English women of the time. During this time period only men attended universities and women were expected to master skills such as needlework and knitting: It was considered \\"unbecoming\\" for them to know Greek or Latin, almost immodest for them to be authors, and certainly indiscreet to admit the fact. Mrs. Barbauld was merely the echo of popular sentiment when she protested that women did not want colleges. \\"The best way for a woman to acquire knowledge,\\" she wrote, \\"is from conversation with a father, or brother, or friend.\\" By the early 1800s, this sentiment had changed, and it was more common to question \\"why a woman of forty should be more ignorant than a boy of twelve,\\"Smith, Sydney, 1810, Female Education, The Works of the Rev. Sydney Smith, retrieved 28 August 2014. which coincided with the waning of the Blue Stockings' popularity. Satiric drawing by Thomas Rowlandson (1756‚Äì1827), \\"Breaking Up of the Blue Stocking Club\\" (1815) The group has been described by many historians and authors such as Jeanine DobbsJeanine Dobbs, \\"The Blue- Stockings: Getting it Together\\", Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, Vol. 1, No. 3. (Winter, 1976), pp. 81‚Äì93. as \\"having preserved and advanced feminism\\" due to the advocacy of women's education, social complaints of the status and lifestyle expected of the women in their society, seen in the writings of the Blue Stocking women themselves: The name \\"Blue Stocking Society\\" and its origins are highly disputed among historians.NY Times 1881 Article There are scattered early references to bluestockings including in the 15th-century Della Calza society in Venice, John Amos Comenius in 1638, and the 17th century Covenanters in Scotland. The society's name perhaps derived from the European fashion in the mid‚Äì18th century in which black stockings were worn in formal dress and blue stockings were daytime or more informal wear. Blue stockings were also very fashionable for women in Paris at the time, though many historians claim the term for the society began when Mrs. Vesey first said to Benjamin Stillingfleet, the aforementioned learned gentleman who had given up society and did not have clothes suitable for an evening party, to \\"Come in your blue stockings\\". Mr. Stillingfleet became a popular guest at the Blue Stocking Society gatherings. Purpose The Blue Stocking society had no membership formalities or fees but was conducted as small to large gatherings in which talk of politics was prohibited but literature and the arts were of main discussion. Learned women with interest in these educational discussions attended as well as invited male guests. Tea, biscuits and other light refreshments would be served to guests by the hostesses. The New York Times archives contain an article published on 17 April 1881 which describes the Blue Stockings Society as a women's movement away from the \\"vice\\" and \\"passion\\" of gambling which was the main form of entertainment at higher society parties. \\"Instead however, of following the fashion, Mrs. Montagu and a few friends Mrs. Boscawen and Mrs. Vesey, who like herself, were untainted by this wolfish passion, resolved to make a stand against the universal tyranny of a custom which absorbed the life and leisure of the rich to the exclusion of all intellectual enjoyment... and to found a society in which conversation should supersede cards.\\" (1881, The New York Times). Many of the Blue Stocking women supported each other in intellectual endeavors such as reading, artwork, and writing. Many also published literature. Author Elizabeth Carter (1717‚Äì1806) was a Blue Stocking Society advocate and member who published essays and poetry, and translated Epictetus. Contemporary author Anna Miegon compiled biographical sketches of these women in her Biographical Sketches of Principal Bluestocking Women.

The original hotel dated from 1829, but the current building opened in 1967. History Pre-dating Brighton's more famous Grand Hotel by over 30 years, the Bedford opened in October 1829, having been built for William Manfield. The late Georgian-style hotel was subsequently leased to its designer, Thomas Cooper, in 1835. This arrangement lasted only until the following year, after which Manfield ran it again until 1844 when he leased it to Joseph Ellis. In 1855 Ellis purchased the hotel outright. As a fashionable hotel in a fashionable resort town, the Bedford attracted many celebrity guests and even royalty. Amongst the guests was Charles Dickens, who wrote Dombey and Son while staying at the hotel. In 1866 the West Pier was built, by Eugenius Birch; it meets the seafront opposite Regency Square, very close to the hotel. The International Gun and Polo Club, founded by George Mashall in 1874, was based in the Bedford Hotel, though the grounds were located in Preston Village, Brighton, probably at Preston Park.Horace A. Laffaye, Polo in Britain: A History, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2012, p. 24 The original Bedford Hotel, Brighton was mentioned in the patter of the English music hall song \\"By the Sea\\", as recorded in 1910 by Mark Sheridan, who popularised the more famous \\"I Do Like To be Beside the Seaside\\". The song was composed by Billy Williams and Fred Godfrey. Mr. A. J. Morriss (often referred to as ‚ÄúAJ‚Äù), bought the hotel in 1947 and made numerous alterations and improvements to it. It is believed that his all stainless steel kitchen and utensils was the first to be installed in any hotel in England. He also had a proper sprung dance floor put in, so that they could extend the use of the dining-room. Whilst refurbishing the bedrooms other rooms were found hidden behind fireplaces which were being dismantled. Unfortunately, one evening, Morriss was attacked with a heavy hydrant key to his head by a young man, who unbeknownst to anyone, had recently been discharged from a psychiatric hospital, who was staying at the hotel with his mother. He made medical history at the time by having brain surgery whilst still conscious ‚Äì he eventually recovered, but his eyesight was greatly impaired. Morriss sold the hotel in 1961. By 1963 the hotel was owned by AVP Industries, and in that year there was controversy surrounding their desire to replace the building with a modern 14-storey tower block.My Brighton and Hove -- the Bedford Hotel Shortly after this, on 1 April 1964, the original building was destroyed by a fire -- with the death of two people. The hotel was rebuilt on the same site, re-opening on 16 September 1967. The 168-feet tall, 17-storey block was designed by R. Seifert and Partners as a 127-room hotel and also a section of private domestic flats, known as Bedford Towers. In April 1974, the hotel accommodated many of the competitors in that year‚Äôs Eurovision Song Contest, held in the city. Winners ABBA fortuitously stayed in the Napoleon Suite. As of 2007 the hotel has 131 guest rooms, a cocktail lounge and restaurant.Holiday Inn Brighton Architecture The original hotel had five storeys with two recessed Ionic porticoes facing south and west above the entrances. Its west wing (the first part to open) was recessed from the road and decorated with giant pilasters. The interior had a Grecian hall with Ionic columns and a glazed dome. The modern replacement building bears no resemblance to its predecessor. There is a tower with balconies on most floors in a staggered arrangement, atop a broad ground floor section; the ground floor has large windows and a covered terrace which serves as a porte-coch√®re.

It originally housed boys and girls in different departments with the boys on the southern edge, eventually running as two separate school establishments (one for boys and the other for girls) in 1945.

Maximum Ride Maximum \\"Max\\" Ride is the leader of the 'flock'. In the first book, she is 14 but turns 15 in Fang. She has sun-streaked brown hair and chocolate brown eyes. She is 5'8\\", a little over 90lbs with a wingspan of 13 feet. Her wings are tan with brown spots, and her primary feathers are streaked black and white. She strives to make the flock happy, and when they face challenges, she feels as if she has to protect them. They are all often viewed as her children, though Max sometimes forgets that she is not much older than the rest of them. She, like the other members in the flock, is 98% human and 2% avian (bird), giving her wings, lighter bones, stronger muscles, and faster healing time. In MAX Max talks with Fang in a hotel after talking to him about Nudge wanting to cut her wings off, she holds her fear and stays. Later the Flock meets Dylan who, according to Dr. Gunther- Hagen, is Max's \\"perfect another half\\". Max begins to feel an attraction for Dylan. In Angel, she and Dylan grow closer, confusing her feelings about Fang, who begins to grow closer with Maya, who is Max's clone. Max is one of the two members of the Flock who found her parents; Iggy is the other. Yet she is the only one to love her parents, Iggy leaving his after only a week or so because he thought they were using him. She was stunned when she learned that Jeb Batchelder (a \\"white coat\\" who helped them escape from the school and then raised them) is her father. Dr. Valencia Martinez is her biological mother. Max trusts Dr. Martinez completely, but remains wary of Jeb. She is also close to her half-sister, Dr. Martinez' daughter Ella. Max dislikes and feels pity for Ari (Jeb's son), with whom she is constantly fighting until he joins her \\"mini-flock\\" that was created in Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports for a short time after rescuing them from the School. A short while after Ari is rescued from the School, he expires (\\"white coat\\" word for died). After Ari's \\"death\\" the two mini-flocks created by Max and Fang come back together. It is then that Jeb is revealed as Max's father, making Ari her half-brother; however, she'd already considered him as her \\"brother-in-law\\" while trapped in the dungeon with man-eating monsters. Max has a Voice in her head, which gives her cryptic messages that she sometimes disregards. She initially feared that it was an enemy inside her, or someone from the School tracking the Flock. At one point Max believes the Voice to be Jeb Batchelder's; she is later disappointed when he assures her he is not the voice, but he can be. In Nevermore, it is revealed that Angel is Max's voice, and doesn't believe it. In Angel, Max lets Dylan replace Fang. She was angry that Fang replaced her with her clone, and she figured out the clone's name was Maya. Also, Fang created a new \\"flock\\" with all kinds of new talents. This deeply pains Max. There is also the doomsday group. They put a strange spell-like hypnosis on people so they act like zombies and believe in nothing but the \\"One Light\\". So, Max's flock and Fang's gang are forced to work together. Max and Fang fight almost nonstop, so this plan was not a success. In the end, Angel goes missing after a huge explosion, which pains Max a great deal. Nonetheless, Max and Fang end up kissing each other passionately at the end of Nevermore. Throughout a few of the books before this one, Max and Angel were somewhat at odds; after Angel goes missing and then is found in Nevermore, she and Max's relationship is stronger and better. Max also has the ability to fly extremely fast, her top speed at roughly 240‚Äì250 miles per hour (verified by the Director through a microchip in her arm), or over 350 miles per hour in a fast dive. Unlike any other member of the Flock except for Fang - this may be because in School's Out--Forever, Max donated her blood to Fang; afterwards, he says he is experiencing the same heat waves that Max suffered from before she gained her supersonic flight abilities. In MAX, it turns out she also has gills like Angel. Her bird DNA is from a hawk, as confirmed in the excerpt from Nevermore, found in the Deluxe paperback of ANGEL. Fang Fang is a 14-year-old avian-human hybrid (turns 15 in Fang), and second-in-command of the Flock. He is tall, with olive skin, dark eyes, and black hair. Fang has black feathers and a wingspan of 14 feet. He is generally quiet, rarely showing his emotions (the \\"strong and silent type\\") Fang has the ability to seemingly \\"disappear\\" by blending in with dark backgrounds (camouflage) or just in a regular area (invisibility) as long as he stays quiet and makes no sudden movements. His good-looking features and past relationship with Max helps her to fall in love with him. (This happens in Max) Fang has romantic feelings for Max, as shown when they a couple of times, which makes Max confused. Max keeps pushing Fang away but he never gives up on her. Finally, Max doesn't run away from Fang when they make-out in the desert, and they become an item. She kisses Fang before she goes underwater to save Dr. Martinez, expressing her love for him. He was taken by the School as a baby shortly after he was born. Fang eventually learns that his mother was a teenager when he was born and that she had been told he had died prior to being taken. In Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports, Fang was furious when Max rescued Ari from the School and invited him to join them. As a result, the Flock split, with Fang, Iggy and Gazzy traveling to the West Coast of the United States and Max, Nudge, Angel, Total, and Ari going to Europe. Later, at the end of the book, the Flock regrouped. Angel correctly predicts that Fang will be the first to die in Fang, but Max revives him by injecting his heart with adrenaline. He leaves in the second epilogue because he thinks he is endangering the Flock by distracting Max from her role as leader. He lets her know numerous times in a letter that he loves her more than anything, and leaves Max a promise ring. He says to her that if they are both still alive in 20 years and the world was still in one piece, he will meet her at the top of the cliff where they met the hawks in The Angel Experiment. In Angel Fang tries to defeat the Doomsday Group with the help of some Gen 77 kids and a clone of Max named Maya . When Maya first arrives, he thinks this is a bad idea, making it even harder to be apart from Max, but he soon starts to notice differences and recognizes Maya as a unique individual. He also mentions several times that he has felt attracted to her. \\"He had to force himself to keep his breathing regular\\" and \\"had to force himself not to kiss her\\", though it's never clear that he has these thoughts because he truly likes Maya, or she just reminds him of Max. Meanwhile, he is jealous of Dylan, who loves Max. He almost accepts him toward the end, saying that \\"he is trying to be a team player.\\" In Maximum Ride Forever, Fang leaves when the flock decided to split up. He travels to North America, trying to find a girl who posted something on his blog. Fang soon has to fight erasers and comes across Dylan. Dylan tries to save him, but blacks out. Fang than has to fight off a few erasers. They tear off his left wing before being killed. At the end, Dylan brings Fang back to life by killing himself. We also learn that Max and Fang slept with each other, leading to Max's pregnancy.  Iggy  Iggy is a 14-year-old avian-human hybrid (turns 15 in Fang). He is blind but has adjusted well. Like all the others [except for Max, Fang, and Angel] he has not developed gills, and thus cannot breathe underwater. In Angel: A Maximum Ride Novel, Iggy is described as six feet tall and skinny. He has really pale skin, strawberry-blonde hair, and light blue eyes. His wings span over fourteen feet and are the same color as his hair, sometimes being considered as white when Angel once compares him to an albatross. He is sarcastic by nature. Iggy is blind because the Whitecoats at the School experimented on his eyes. He can distinguish the Flock members by their voice and foot steps. He is described as being a good cook. He loves explosives and is a skilled bomb- maker, usually working with the Gasman to destroy a target. In The Angel Experiment, he and Gazzy build a bomb they call \\"Big Boy\\" to protect their home and get rid of the Erasers. He is described as being very smart. In School's Out Forever Iggy learns about his past; his real name is James Griffiths and he was kidnapped by the School when he was four months old. He finds his parents and decides to leave the Flock; However, he soon returns after he learns that his parents were only interested in making money off his story. In Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports, he leaves the Flock and joins Fang and Gazzy's \\"mini flock\\". When the Flock members reunite, they go to Dr. Martinez. In Angel, Iggy is brainwashed by the Doomsday Group. Max, Dylan, and Angel snap him out of it by forcing him under cold water. In Nevermore: The Final Maximum Ride Adventure, Iggy and Ella kiss. In \\"Maximum Ride: Forever \\" Iggy learns that Ella is dead. He travels with Gazzy to America and find survivors there, but then Dylan tracks them down and seemingly kills them both. It is later revealed that he is alive and help take down the Remedy.  Nudge  Nudge is an 11-year-old avian-human hybrid ( turns 12 in Fang ). She is fairly tall with curly brown hair, mocha colored skin, and dark-brown eyes. She is African American, as Max describes. Nudge is a \\"motormouth\\" which Max says repeatedly, the flock calls her the Nudge channel because when she's awake it's all Nudge all the time. Nudge's wings are a tawny brown, sometimes described as cream in coloration. She doesn't like rats. Her real name is Monique; Tiffany-Krystal is her alternate name (she likes it better than her real name), and her code is N88034gnh. Nudge can sense old emotions, attract metal to her hand, and hack into almost any computer system. Sensing old emotions has its disadvantages; she feels great distress when touching something which has seen great sadness, as she did at the Vietnam Memorial. Of all the Flock, Nudge is the one most determined to find her biological parents and exhibits a strong desire to be normal, up to the point where she even wishes to get rid of her wings (which never happens). She is feminine, loves fashion, and is concerned with her appearance. Nudge is the most agreeable character, usually allied with Max. In Max, she uncharacteristically stays behind at The Day and Night School while the rest of the Flock leaves. She soon finds she misses them and returns.  The Gasman (Gazzy)  The Gasman is a 8-year-old avian-human hybrid ( turns 9 in Fang ) who really likes to fart. He does not get trapped in Maximum Ride 4 but sadly Fang, Max, Angel, Total and Akila do. Gazzy is a kid. His wings resemble a barn owl's in color, and his wingspan is . He earned his name because he frequently passes gas. Gazzy is Angel's older brother; they are the only members of the Flock who are blood relatives and share the same blue eyes and blond hair (Gazzy has a cowlick). When Angel told him that their parents had sold them to the School for $10,000 each he was horrified, complaining for hours that they were \\"sick jerks\\". Gazzy has a fear of spiders. His code at the School was F28246Jeff and while the Flock attends school in Virginia, he is known as Zephyr. Gazzy is skilled in mimicry and ventriloquism. He can pass gas at will, giving off a mushroom cloud of green gas. He, along with Iggy, is skilled at making bombs and has a lot of knowledge about them, as Max states, \\"You could lock the Gasman in a padded cell with some dental floss and a bowl of Jell-O, and he'd find a way to make something explode.\\" For example, when he and Iggy had to escape from their original house in The Angel Experiment they created a bomb to distract and, hopefully, rid themselves of the Erasers for the time being. In Max he and Iggy turned the \\"dumb-bots\\" into \\"popcorn\\" at the Flock's safe house by shooting a lightning rod at a crowd of them. They dub this the \\"Gaz-Ig-Nart\\" technique, using it once more against a nuclear submarine when Dumb-bots attacked it. Gazzy also knows a lot of information about guns, which is briefly shown in Max when he and the rest of the flock are training at the Navy Base in Hawaii. In Angel, Gazzy is traumatized after nearly allowing Jeb to die after a plane crash. Afterwards, he and Angel join the Doomsday Group as spies for the Flock. At the end of the book, Gazzy has seven minutes to disarm an arsenal of bombs and poison gas in Paris and is mostly successful.  Angel  Angel is the youngest of the flock, a 6-year- old avian-human hybrid ( has a birthday, her seventh, with the rest of the Flock in Fang, but said that she turned seven in Max). She has curly blonde hair, blue eyes, and white wings that make her look angelic. According to Max, Angel \\"hit the genetic jackpot\\", developing a variety of powers throughout the series. She is telepathic and can influence most people to do her will. Angel can breathe underwater, talk to animals, send animals mental messages, and change her appearance at will, although this power is mentioned only once or twice throughout the series. Angel is also a prophet, she foresees Fang's \\"death\\" and the end of the world. Angel owns a small black Scottish Terrier named Total, whom she stole from the Institute for Higher Living, and a small stuffed bear dressed as an angel named Celeste. Although she is somewhat claustrophobic unlike the rest of the Flock, she also likes small cozy spaces. Max describes Angel's bed in their original house as \\"like a nest‚Äîfull of stuffed animals, books, most of her clothes\\". She wants to replace Max and is more likely to disobey her than the others. Angel disappeared after the explosion in Angel; Max and the others mistakenly assume she is dead. In Nevermore, she was being held captive by the School. She was eventually rescued by the rest of the flock. In Forever, she ends up leading the mutant army to destroy the Remedy. Angel also is Max's favorite. Angel is around 12 in the last book of the series.  Total  Total is a black Scottie, who joined the Flock after their visit to the Institute of Higher Living. They found him there on a little table and Angel wanted to keep him, so the flock adopted him. He has the ability to leap great heights of up to fifteen feet or more and he can talk in English and French, and he could probably talk in more languages if he learned them. Total seems to know more about recent history than the Flock does; he can identify Brad Pitt in Madame Tussauds, and opines that there were two shooters in the JFK assassination. He is refined, expressing disgust when Max refuses to stop and enjoy the sights of Paris. Total is devoted to Angel at first, gravitating towards Max as the series progresses. Angel never leaves Total behind; in the second book, the Flock returned to Anne's house for Total, although it was swarming with Erasers. In the fourth book, Total falls in love with a white Malamute named Akila, who nearly dies in a hurricane. When he discovers she survived he licks her face, which she enjoys. However, Akila is a normal dog; she cannot understand Total when he speaks to her in English or French. Max talks to Total about this; Total says he can talk to Akila in his \\"native language\\" (dog language). Total and Akila marry at the end of Fang. He reappears as a minor character in Angel, staying with Dr. Martinez and Ella while Akila visits her family after their honeymoon. His small black wings, developed in The Final Warning, have grown to their full size, and he can fly without difficulty.  Phoenix  Phoenix, nicknamed Fifi and Ninja Nix, is the child of Max and Fang born at the end of Maximum Ride Forever. She is also almost 5 years old. Like her parents, she is a human-avian hybrid with wings. She is seen to be agile and smart, although exactly what abilities she inherited from her parents are currently unknown. Phoenix has brown eyes like Max and raven black hair and wings like Fang. Max says that although her name is Phoenix, she plans on giving her the ability to choose her own name like she did. She is only briefly spoken of in the last book of the series as she begins her first flying lessons with her family.  Characters from the School  = Dr. Jeb Batchelder = He is the mentor and teacher of the Flock, after helping the Flock escape, he leaves, supposedly dead. When Angel is captured, the Flock sees him again, but as a whitecoat. Throughout the next few books, he is seen as one of the enemy whitecoats; at the end Saving the World and other Extreme Sports, it becomes clear that Jeb is working as a sort of double agent for the Flock, though Max and her gang still see him as untrustworthy. He is the father of Ari, who was turned into an Eraser when his father took the Flock from the School. Relations between the two become strained after this episode. However, Jeb still demonstrates that although he may not be the best of fathers, he still loves his son. Also at the end of the third book, it is revealed that Jeb is Max's father: this explains how after Max killed Ari in the first book, Jeb called out, \\"You killed your own brother!\\" He and Dr. Martinez, Max's mom, did not have a personal relationship - they made Max through IVF; he is not Ella's father. He and Max both had dirty blond hair (as well as Ari), but Jeb, unlike Max, has blue eyes. = Ari Batchelder = He wants to help Max in MAximum Ride 3 and she says yes which makes Fang mad and they split.In the 3rd book the flock finds out that Ari has an expiration date and that he is MAx's half brother. The School made him hunt the Flock. He is the most wolf-like of the Erasers‚Äîalways in a partially morphed state, he was once mistaken for Wolverine by a young boy at Disney World. Ari is illiterate; he, like Max, hears a Voice in his head too. As the son of Jeb Batchelder, he is Max's half-brother. When he was three years old his father disappeared with the Flock, leaving Ari in the care of the School's genetic scientists. They experimented with Ari, incorporating his original DNA with wolf DNA and transforming him into an Eraser; the change causes him burning pain. His features before the transformation were dirty blond hair and blue eyes. Despite his desire for Max's death, Ari admires her. He is willing to do anything to kill the entire group, especially Fang. During the fight in The Angel Experiment, Max kills Ari by breaking his neck. The School saves him by realigning his spine and grafts a pair of wings onto his back. Ari also appears in \\"Schools Out Forever\\" when he plans to kidnap Max in order to win her approval and attention. Ari's greatest desire is to have Jeb be proud of him; he is jealous of how his father dotes on Max. He expresses a desire to choke his father, and Jeb realizes he ought to pay more attention to him. He doesn't talk much, \\"as if he didn't think he had a right to an opinion.\\" Ari tries to support Max during her tests against Omega and later, when a mutant riot breaks out, uses his strength to \\"toss smaller mutants into the mosh pit of death\\". In the middle of the fight, he suddenly dies. Jeb and the Flock attend Ari's makeshift funeral, each tossing dirt onto the casket; most say a few words. Max, Nudge, Total and Angel break down and cry. In the fifth book the Flock's new enemy, Mr. Chu, creates an Ari lookalike robot in an attempt to frighten Max; it is destroyed in Iggy and Gazzy's explosion. In Nevermore, a clone of Ari that Jeb creates because he felt he could try to go back and correct his mistakes with Ari, brutally beats up Maya and she dies while in Fang's arms. Ari has dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. = Maya (formerly Max II) = At the beginning of the series, Max II is an evil clone of the original Max who attempts to destroy the Flock by killing her predecessor. In School's Out Forever, Max is kidnapped and replaced by Max II; however, she is exposed by announcing she was going to cook (despite the fact that Max doesn't like to cook or can't cook), by her ignorance of the Flock, and by Angel's mind-reading (Angel very conveniently forgot that she could read minds until both Maxes were in the same room). She had been spying on the Flock (aided by Ari) because they annoyed her. At the end of School's Out Forever, Max II fights what is supposed to be a death match with the original Max, who spares her because she regards her clone as another person. Max II seems convinced that the original Max is self-confident, but speaks with empathy when observing her. In Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports, the Flock finds her at the headquarters of Itex in Germany with other mutants preparing for termination. She warns the original Max about how fast Itex is killing the mutants and says that they have a day before they too are terminated. There are also clones of Nudge and Angel, but they are never mentioned again. She returns in Angel where she has changed her name to Maya, gained a tolerance for teenage antics and a romantic interest in Fang, taken a pixie cut, added a magenta streak to her hair, and joined Fang's new group. Fang, at first, has some problems with Maya due to her resemblance to Max; he has to force himself not to kiss her. Throughout the book, she tries to establish that despite being Max's clone, she has her own personality and feelings. Fang eventually appreciates this. In Nevermore, Maya falls while fighting Clone Ari; Fang catches her, but Ari suddenly elbows her in the rib cage, killing her in Fang's arms. As she dies, she tells Fang that she loves him. Fang simply responds with, \\"I know,\\" not reciprocating her love due to his true feelings of loving Max. = Anne Walker = Anne pretends to be (and maybe is) an FBI agent, whom the Flock meets shortly after an attack which forces Fang to be taken to a hospital for treatment. She offers the Flock (who are disguised as children of missionaries) protection in exchange for a chance to study them in \\"non-painful, noninvasive\\" ways. Anne brings them to her country ch√¢teau and treats them with parental kindness and generosity. Anne also enrolls the Flock in a school without their knowledge. When Iggy and Gazzy set off bombs in their new home she gives them hot chocolate and cookies, annoying Max. Living alone, she is unaccustomed to domesticity and struggles to cook and make her new guests comfortable. Her greatest success was the Flock's first Thanksgiving meal and she offers to adopt them‚Äîunsettling Max, who is jealous of Anne's position with the Flock. Soon after Thanksgiving Max is cornered by the school's manner and several whitecoats, which convinces her it is time to leave. The Flock escapes from the school, returning to the house to get Total. Erasers arrive at Anne's house; she does not resist their search. After retrieving Total, Max flies down to talk to Jeb, Ari, and Anne; Jeb reveals that Anne is his boss. Heartbroken, the Flock leaves quickly. In Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports, the Flock is captured and taken back to the School. According to Max, Anne acts \\"in an un-adoptive Mom way\\" and tries to convince the Flock that they had dreamed their adventure away from the School. When the Flock is caged in preparation for termination, she tells them \\"You know what's really sad? ... We gave you every chance\\"; this leads Max to angrily point out that they only gave them some chances‚Äîgiving them every chance would include letting them out of the cage. = Dr. Roland ter Borcht = Roland ter Borcht is a brilliant, controversial German geneticist who was notorious for sinister experiments he performed on humans. He is one of the leading scientists at Itex, although he appears to also play an important role at the School. Ter Borcht is first mentioned in School's Out Forever, when Max finds his name in some documents she stole from Itex and then finds out more about him through an online search engine. Later when the Flock breaks into an Itex plant for information, they see that Nudge's parents supposedly signed a document allowing ter Borcht to \\"treat\\" their baby. However, the signature on the document is in Jeb Batchelder's handwriting. Ter Borcht meets the Flock in person in Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports. He tries to examine the Flock when they are recaptured and brought back to the School in an attempt to see if they are worth sparing. Instead, the Flock becomes angry at the way he treats them; they are rude and refuse to cooperate. Later ter Borcht gasses them and moves them into a cage to be executed since he said that they have no reason why they should be spared. Angel (spying for the Flock) knocks him unconscious. Max, Nudge, Angel, Ari and Total encounter him again in Europe when he tries to force them to answer questions posed by Chinese scientists interested in buying the Flock as weapons. Ter Borcht is firmly against allowing the Flock to live. He is described as having an Arnold Schwarzeneggeresque accent and is fat, in stark contrast with the Flock (who are skeletal avian-human recombinants). = Dr. Marian Janssen (the Director) = The Director pulls the strings for the School and Itex and claims to be one of the few successful Itex species combinations. She plans the Re- Evolution and By-Half Plans. The Director claims to be a hybrid human‚ÄîGal√°pagos tortoise, 107 years old. She is the reason Max had a chip implanted in her arm. The chip recorded Max's flight speed and height, giving the Director information to relay to the Chinese scientists. Max, Nudge, Angel, Total and Ari meet the Director in the Itex headquarters in Europe when they are caught by the Flyboys and brought to her. When she first appears, Max is surprised that she is a female. The Director further shocks the mini-Flock by announcing that she is Max's mother. Because they look and act similarly this is assumed to be true, to Max's horror. However, the Director has no problem with submitting Max to horrible \\"tests\\". She also urges Max to work for the Chinese as a weapon, saying it is her only chance to survive. Jeb wonders why Max hates the Director since she can give Max power. He tells Max that she passed the test of being incorruptible by way of power and that the Director is not really her mother; she only supervised Max's development as an embryo. Shortly after learning this, Max is summoned to a gathering by the Director; she is instructed to submit to three tests and a battle to the death against Itex's best creation, a boy named Omega. Although Max wins the first test (a race), the Director disqualifies her because Max flew; it was \\"a race on the ground\\". She fails the other test, and the Director ignores her protests that the tests are a waste of time and have nothing to do with being able to survive. Shortly before the fight Angel causes a mutant riot with her mind, and the Director orders the Flyboys to break up the fighting. After the riot is over and the Flyboys destroyed, Max and Nudge capture the Director and fly away; they demand to know who Max's real mother is. After the Director answers their questions Max drops her, intending to let her die in the fall. Jeb (as the Voice) convinces them to catch her instead. = Omega = The Director considers Omega Itex's most-successful experiment. He looks human but is superhuman in his speed, strength, sight, intelligence, obedience and flawless immune system. His only known weakness is slow sight reactions and tracking (despite the Director's claim that he is perfect). Omega's only appearance is in Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports. He is introduced by the Director (at the story's end) to a group of scientists as the new \\"perfect human\\", who could survive if they blew up the world. She forces Max to compete with Omega in several challenges to demonstrate Omega's superior skills. At first, Max defeats him in battle, saying to him,\\"You should change your name to Theta. Or Epsilon.\\" Max wins the first challenge (a race), but he is declared the winner (the Director insists that Max cheated by flying). He defeats Max in contests of strength and intelligence. The Director instructs them to fight to the death; Angel incites a riot, which the Flyboys attempt to quell. During the riot, Omega finds Max and insists that they must still fight. Max points out that he can choose to not fight; he looks confused, saying \\"I don't know how to...not.\\" He nearly defeats her, but she uses her knowledge of his inferior sight tracking to overcome him. Max refuses to kill him, although she knows that Omega would kill her if he could. = Erasers = Erasers are human-lupine mutants, trained to return the Flock to Itex. Designed as guards and killers, they are trained to be ruthless in addition to their bloodthirsty nature. The Erasers appear as supermodel-like humans, but they assume a wolf-like appearance for killing. They are considered useful, but generally unsuccessful. Erasers have a short lifespan, usually living for only a few years, so the scientists designed them to reach maturity in about four years. Erasers have increased muscle density in both human and lupine form; they usually weigh over . The Eraser version 6.5 has wings. The graft does not work as well as the Flock's, so their flying is awkward and painful. Ari is changed into an Eraser in the first book, so the whitecoats could see what would happen if lupine DNA was not grafted in infancy. In the second book Ari receives wings, which makes him envy the Flock; his wings are clumsier and do not fold as neatly as theirs do. The Erasers were killed by the white coats at the beginning of the third book because they were unsuccessful; although replaced by the Flyboys, they reappear in Fang. Also, in Nevermore, Fang's gang is shown to be fighting them. = Gozen = Gozen is a malevolent cyborg who serves the √úber-Director by leading the Director's personal army. He has great strength but is clumsy and stupid. Gozen appears in The Final Warning to capture the Flock like the Erasers; he was merely programmed as an unsympathetic military commander who would execute orders without question and remain absolutely loyal to the √úber-Director. Gozen captures the Flock; during their transport, he breaks Angel's arm to frighten them. After he brings the Flock to the Director he watches the auction, during which a hurricane tears through the building. Gozen and the √úber-Director escape; when he begs Max for help she kicks his arm, forcing him to release his grip on the √úber-Director. = The √úber-Director = The √úber-Director heads an unnamed company, possibly Itexicon (as his name implies he is the replacement for the Director.) He is composed of organs in glass cases connected by metal limbs (making him half- machine and half-human) and uses a wheelchair. It is implied that the √úber- Director is one of the experiments Max saw when Ari gave her a tour of the school's experiments. Max calls him \\"the √úD\\" to annoy him. In The Final Warning, he captures the Flock and auctions them. During the auction, a hurricane tears through the building, and the √úber-Director is killed. He is the only person Max has ever killed; she justifies it with the claim that \\"(√úber-Director) was a machine, someone's consciousness hooked up to a biomechanical body\\", and rarely dwells on it. = Dumb-bots = The \\"Dumb- bots,\\" as the Flock refers to them, are humanoid robots (serving the √úber- Director) who became flawed during their development. They shoot laser beams from their eyes and are addicted to rewarding shocks from the √úber-Director. = Flyboys = Flyboys are the Erasers' robotic replacements; some have guns attached to their hands. Flyboys are strong, fast and nimble both in the air and on the ground. They do not adapt well to change and are slow-witted. Fang, Iggy, and Gazzy fight off the Flyboys in the third book at an abandoned airplane hangar after the Flock splits up. They are nearly shot, but Fang returns fire with a gun stolen from a Flyboy. They cause the Flyboys to fly into the Hollywood Sign; later they lure them into the water, shorting them out.  Allies  = Ella Martinez = Ella is the 12-year-old (possibly 13 by the final book) daughter of Dr. Martinez. Ella has a crush on Iggy, which makes Max uncomfortable because she \\"feels like a mom to Iggy\\". Max first meets Ella in The Angel Experiment, when she stopped Ella's bully from beating Ella up. While defending her, Max is shot by the guy. She asks Ella for help and spends two days recuperating at Ella's house. Ella appears twice in Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports: once when Max asks to see Dr. Martinez (Ella comes with her) and again at the end of the story. She appears once in The Final Warning when she attends a ribbon-cutting at the new school intended for the Flock. She has blond hair and hazel eyes. In MAX, Ella is hysterical when her mother is kidnapped; they are both in tears when they are reunited. In Angel, Ella is brainwashed by the Doomsday Group and programmed to \\"save the planet, kill the humans\\". Max and the Flock free her by soaking her in a desert hot spring, while Angel repairs her memory. When she discovers her mother and Jeb are missing, she wants to go with the Flock to find them; she expresses a wish to stay with them and Max sadly tells her she cannot because they will be flying. Ella leaves, writing in the sand \\"I was meant to have wings.\\" At the end of Nevermore, Ella kisses Iggy, which may have kindled a relationship between them. She is killed in the final book, Forever, by the flood. = Dr. Valencia Martinez = Dr. Martinez is a veterinarian, the mother of Ella and (as is later revealed to the readers) Max as well. In The Angel Experiment she meets Max, treating her bullet wound. Dr. Martinez bakes cookies and cares for her; she also reveals Max's chip. She removes Max's chip in Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports and is horrified when she learns Max has temporarily lost the use of her hand; however, she regains its use after her kidnapping by the white coats. Max's mother is at the first meeting with the Flock and the government, and she introduces the Flock to Dr. Brigid Dwyer in The Final Warning. The last time she is seen is at the ribbon-cutting for the new school intended for the Flock.Patterson, James. Maximum Ride: The Final Warning, p. 272 She has dirty blond hair and brown eyes. In MAX, Dr. Martinez is kidnapped by Mr. Chu and his M-Geeks. They torture her, trying to force her to denounce her environmentalism and fearing that their illegal dumping of radioactive material will be uncovered. Dr. Martinez refuses to denounce the CSM; she is starved, electrocuted, and nearly killed by Mr. Chu's second-in-command when she is rescued by Max and Angel. She is last seen convalescing in a United States Navy infirmary. Nudge asks Dr. Martinez to care for Max in Angel: A Maximum Ride Novel. She allows Jeb and Dr. Hans into her home and agrees with most of their ideas, except for \\"breeding\\" Max. Dr. Martinez agrees to visit Gen-77 and is in the plane which explodes. Max catches her, and she treats the Flock's injuries; Total sees her leaving the house with Jeb. She is killed by the flood in Forever. = Akila = Akila is a malamute with whom Total falls in love in The Final Warning. She is with the Flock when they are taken by Gozen to the √úber-Director's auction when the hurricane kills the √úber-Director. In MAX, Total muses about leaving the Flock to marry Akila. In the first epilogue of Fang, she and Total are married, with the Flock in attendance. She later dies in Forever. = Celeste = Celeste is Angel's teddy bear, an angel bear with a halo. Angel uses post-hypnotic suggestion to encourage a woman to buy it for her in The Angel Experiment. She nearly loses it in New York when they are surrounded by scientists disguised as police officers. Ari took Celeste, using it to lure Angel into a trap, but she uses her mind power to make him drop Celeste and gets her bear back. She carries Celeste tucked either under her shirt or in the waistband of her pants. Angel does her best to take good care of Celeste but, due to the nature of their missions, she usually ends up looking like a mess. By Fang, Angel no longer carries Celeste. = Harry = Harry is a bird-kid that Max meets in Maximum Ride Forever. He is described to be more bird than human, being completely covered by feathers (except his head), and able to fly perfectly and effortlessly. He can not talk, and when Max asks him, \\"Who are you?\\" he repeats, \\"Huryu\\"! When Max introduces herself as Maximum Ride, he introduces himself as Huryu, which Max changes to Harry. He becomes part of the flock and calls Max \\"Max Mum\\".  Other characters  = Mike = Mike is the boy with the laptop, featured three times all in very different places. He is a genius who is Schizophrenic, and went to MIT, but got kicked out for not taking his medicine. In the end, he gives up with the computer, and he becomes part of the doomsday group and the leave him to die in the desert. = Dylan = Dylan is an avian-human hybrid who is introduced to the Flock in Fang. He claims to have been raised in a lab in Canada, and to be eight months old. Dylan is tall and bulkier than Fang (which makes Max think he has regular access to food); he is tan, with longish blond sun-streaked hair, blue eyes and white with a tint of black and brown wings. Dylan was cloned from another Dylan, who \\"died in a car wreck\\" eight months before the present Dylan's introduction to the Flock. He has keen sight, and hints that he can \\"see things happening far away, can see people across oceans ‚Äì maybe even across time\\". Dylan can also heal minor wounds with his saliva. Max's Voice told her that Dylan was \\"designed for her\\", describing him as her \\"perfect another half\\"; for his part, he acts as if this were true. Dylan's wings resemble Max's, but she notes that while her wings have been designed for speed, his are designed for strength. Dylan claims that while he has only been alive for eight months, he is a fighting machine. He tries to convince Fang that he is endangering Max and the others, since Dylan was obviously designed to protect and love Max. After many failures to gain Max's attention, he attempts suicide at the end of Fang but fails. In Angel, Max and Dylan's relationship begins to warm. At first, Max feels uncomfortable, but as more affection is shared she feels as though it is \\"right\\" and \\"beautiful\\". When Fang's group and Max's Flock unite against the Doomsday Group, Fang begins to be jealous of Dylan. His jealousy pleases Dylan and he continues to try to make Fang jealous so that he can have Max to himself so while Fang is gone he builds a tree house and tells Max it's a gift. Max and Dylan are having a date in a tree house that Dylan built. Their candlelit dinner is interrupted by Nudge, Iggy and Gazzy spying on them. Their Voices have told them to record everything so they have a video camera which they filmed Max and Dylan's kiss with. Max is angry so she kicks the table causing the candle to fall over. This sets fire to the tree and the tree house. Once the Flock gets to safety she apologizes to Dylan saying that the treehouse was the most beautiful thing that she had ever seen. Dylan tells her that she's the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. In Maximum Ride Forever, Dylan pretends to work with his father as he attempts to kill off the flock. But unfortunately, he blacked out when trying to save Fang from an eraser attack. Fang dies. But at the end of the book, Dylan makes a scheme to bring Fang back to life. Max later finds a note that states Dylan knew she didn't love him, but he wanted her to be happy. When Dylan saves Fang he kills himself. Dylan's note to Max says that if he can't live with her he'll gladly die for her. = Dr. Hans Gunther-Hagen = A wealthy German philanthropist, Gunther-Hagen is introduced to Max in Fang during the Flock's visit to Africa; he later introduces Max to Dylan. He has written a book advocating genetic engineering for humans and wants Max to join him in his genetic studies. He hopes Max will agree willingly (accepting Max's initial demand of $1 million), but seems willing to use force if necessary. Gunther-Hagen accidentally causes Fang's death near the end of Fang; claiming he did not expect his genetic accelerator to kill Fang, he is the first to try to revive him. Mr. Chu works for Gunther-Hagen. He returns in Angel, offering to take Max and Dylan to Germany where they could have children and establish a post-apocalyptic dynasty. Later, he is presumed dead when the Flock cannot find him after a plane crash. Max considers Gunther-Hagen an enemy, despite the ambiguity of his actions. He is apparently in communication with Jeb Batchelder, and they try to convince Max to go with Dylan to Germany. She ridicules him, calling him various nicknames such as \\"Dr. Hans\\", \\"Dr. God\\", \\"Dr. H√§agen-Dazs\\", \\"Dr. G-H\\", and \\"disgusting supremacist\\". He is also revealed to be the Remedy in Maximum Ride Forever. = Mark = Mark is a member of the Doomsday Group, which attempts to blow up Paris. He is greedy, with a lust for power; in battle he is strong. Mark is defeated when Max and Maya unite to overcome him. Holden charged him, making him look like \\"Swiss cheese,\\" and depleting Mark's ammunition. He is presumed dead at the end of Angel when Max sees his body on the ground with wires protruding from it. He is also very mean but in Nevermore where he makes an appearance when the school burns down, he seemed oddly happy, even though his body is covered with burn marks and cuts. He then hysterically throws himself out a window and dies from an iron rod through his throat.  William Pruitt  Pruitt is the principal of the school Max and the Flock attends. He is hateful, and loathes children; this causes Max to question his career choice. He has a bald head, profuse nose hair and wet, plump dark-pink lips. He has a British accent and is not a white coat, but is associated with the School. While spying at recess, Iggy and Gazzy find files indicating that the school was an insane asylum for the incurably ill; they also discover a tunnel in the school basement. Based on this information, they theorize that Pruitt was a patient who killed everyone else in the asylum and founded the school. When they escape from the school and the Flock realizes his connection to the School, Pruitt threatens Max with a taser and tries to catch them with scientists posing as teachers. As they escape, he shouts that they are \\"accidents, stains, mistakes\\".  Lissa, Tess and Sam  Lissa is a 14-year-old student at the school temporarily attended by the Flock, and a minor love interest for Fang. Maximum calls her the \\"Red-Haired Wonder\\", and is immensely jealous of her. Tess is a tall girl, also 14, who appears in School's Out Forever. She is an unexplored love interest for Iggy. Sam is a 14-year-old boy, also a student at the school, who is a minor love interest for Max. She finds him attractive, describing his tortoiseshell eyes and his chestnut hair that \\"kind of fell across his forehead\\" as pleasant. Fang is jealous and mocks the budding relationship. = Dr. Brigid Dwyer = Dr. Dwyer is quite young (21 years old); she works in Antarctica and escorts the Flock there in a small research boat. She is petite, \\"pretty and blonde\\" (however, she has red hair in the fifth book). Max is jealous of her friendship with Fang, despite their seven-year age difference. Fang seems to ignore Max when he is around Brigid, who is unaware of this tension (and of Max's feelings for Fang). Max also resents the fact that Fang writes about Brigid in his blog, but not about her. Max compares her with Lissa (The Red-Haired Wonder) since she thinks that Fang has a \\"thing for red hair\\". She calls Brigid sarcastic mental names, such as \\"Dr. Amazing\\". At the end of MAX, Brigid interacts with Mr. Chu, which Max and her Voice find suspicious. = The Voice = The Voice is in Max's head and appeared halfway through the first book. It gives her advice and directs her in a cryptic way. The voice is also very skeptical of Max's choices. Max once said that the Voice \\"has been watching too much Oprah again,\\" and \\"has been reading Hallmark cards\\" due to its riddles and clues. Max originally thought the Voice originated in her arm chip, but it remained after Dr. Martinez removed the chip. There have been long periods without the Voice. It insists that Max can save the world by whatever means necessary; she says she cannot tell if the Voice is \\"male or female. Friend or Foe. Human or not\\". The Voice was once thought to be Jeb, but he explained to Max that while he \\"can do the Voice\\", he is not the Voice. Similarly, in the first book, Max can \\"see\\" the Institute for Higher Living. In School's Out Forever, it is revealed that Ari has a Voice. Angel also has a Voice in Fang; Max thinks Angel's voice is imaginary because she wants to emulate Max and take over the Flock. When Dylan joins the Flock Angel finally takes it over, later returning it to Max. In the 8th book, Nevermore, Angel reveals that she is actually the Voice, saying \\"Max! I am your Voice!\\". = Mr. Chu = Mr. Chu is an Asian man who tries to force the Flock to \\"sever all ties with the CSM or be killed\\". When his mask of false skin is removed at the end of Fang, he is lizard-like in appearance; his real name is Robert. He is also seen in the beginning of \\"Fang\\", when found to be experimenting with refugees in Chad, Africa. He kidnaps Dr. Valencia Martinez, in an attempt to stop the CSM permanently. Max brings down Mr. Chu's underwater base with Angel and the Krelp, and rescues her mother. =M-Geeks= M-Geeks are humanoid robots who serve Mr. Chu in MAX. They are stronger and faster than humans but have several weaknesses (their ankles, the tops of their heads‚Äîwhich split like an orange‚Äîand their spines). The first version has no weapons, but later versions have Uzi machine guns attached to their arms. The M-Geeks have little difficulty operating in difficult environments, such as 1 km below sea level. Some display emotions, like pride in their abilities. The M-Geeks appear originally human, but with cyborg bodies inside their flesh. Although they are mechanical Angel could order them away during an attack, indicating that some organic components remain in their bodies.  Generation-77  Mentioned by Fang in the epilogue of Fang and later clarified by Jeb and Dr. Hans in Angel, Gen-77 have powers either given to them by laboratories or developed naturally. The only kids from Generation 77 that we know are in Fang's Gang. =Star= Fang's second recruit in Angel, Star is also part of Generation-77 (along with the rest of Fang's group). Star is from an upper-class family; she is often depicted in her school uniform, and her ability is super-speed (she can run extremely fast). However, as a result, her body burns energy quickly and she must eat a lot to compensate. She eats even more than the rest of the flock. She and Ratchet often quarrel, with Kate (Star's friend when they both attended a Catholic school) mediating. Star received her powers when she was abducted from a school field trip and subjected to experiments. Another of her abilities is emitting a high-pitched sound, similar to a hummingbird's (demonstrated when she spun around in a circle), which un-hypnotizes members of the Doomsday group in seconds‚Äîwhich takes Angel hours with water. She also becomes useful when the gang needed Doomsday group information and is \\"transporting from one place to another.\\" In Nevermore, she is revealed to be a traitor on the Erasers' side. =Kate= Kate Tan Wei Ying is the third member of Fang's flock, who appears at a hotel where the rest of the gang is waiting. She has hair that Max would \\"kill for\\" and a nice figure; her powers include strength and quick reflexes. A pacifist and vegan, Kate breaks up fights between Ratchet and Star. She is an old friend of Star's; Ratchet flirts with her. Kate also becomes useful when the gang needed Doomsday group information and is juggling heavy things to show off. In Nevermore, she is revealed to be a traitor on the Erasers' side. =Holden= The final recruit for Fang's Flock, Holden was experimented on and has scars on his arms as a legacy. He can regrow limbs, heal quickly and breathe underwater. The other members (and Holden himself) call him \\"Starfish\\" because he has starfish DNA. He is 15 but looks more like a 10-year-old. =Ratchet= The first recruit for Fang's Flock. Has extraordinary senses. Can see a post-it note at 300 yards, can hear whispers at a distance of a mile, and is very macho. =Beth= Organizer of a Doomsday Group rally in Paris during Angel, Beth attempts to exert mind control on Fang and others through a television news channel but the attempt fails when Moon changes the channel. Beth is described as \\"the Queen of the Doomsday Group\\" when she asserts herself against Mark, ordering him not to kill Max.

It stars Owen Pearce, Chris Massoglia (appearing under the name \\"Chris J. Kelly\\"), Morgan Flynn, William Baldwin, Henry Winkler, and Lisa Guerrero, and is narrated by Jeff Daniels. The film follows a teenage boy, his young brother, and a new-to-town teenage girl as they try to find a marionette from a local television show which has been stolen and held for ransom. Meanwhile, the brothers' father struggles with alcoholism and their mother tries to hold her marriage together. Plot The film is based on a real event that occurred in 1968 in Billings, Montana, the hometown of screenwriter T. J. Lynch.Kemmick, Ed. \\"Who Snatched Froggy Doo?

June 24, 2006. A popular locally produced children's television show, Happy Herb & Froggy Doo, features magician Happy Herb (Henry Winkler) and his wisecracking marionette sidekick, Froggy Doo. Froggy Doo is stolen and held for ransom, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is called in to investigate. Elliott Plumm (Chris Massoglia) used to watch the show, but now feels he is too grown up to do so any longer. His five-year-old brother, Rocky, is a Froggy Doo fan, however. Their father, Mick Plumm (William Baldwin), is a recovering alcoholic and unemployed ex-boxer who believes Elliott's birth prevented him from going to the Olympic Games 12 years earlier. Mick's emotionally distant relationship with Elliott is causing Elliott to become emotionally troubled. Their mother, Roxie Plumm (Lisa Guerrero), is the only breadwinner in the family, and keeping her husband sober and attending to her job means she has little time for her children. Elliott shows little interest in the kidnapping. Shortly thereafter, however, Haley Dubois (Morgan Flynn) and her father arrive in their run-down mobile home and move in next door. Haley's father is the new deputy sheriff in town, and Haley is entranced by the mystery surrounding the kidnapping of Froggy Doo. Elliott quickly begins to fall in love with Haley, and soon he agrees to help Haley and Rocky find Froggy Doo in order to win Haley's heart. The three kids have to find the marionette before the two bumbling FBI agents, Hardigan (Peter Scolari) and Brinkman (Rick Overton) can do so. Elliott, Haley, and Rocky's list of suspects include the local bully, a store clerk, and Happy Herb's wife Viv (Brenda Strong). As the kids pursue the case, Elliott and Rocky's brotherly bond strengthens, and Elliott realizes he might not only win back the love of his father but provide his family with the substantial reward money and help his parents' marriage, too.

Lynch grew up in Billings, where the real-life Happy Herb and Froggy Doo show originated, and watched the show as a child. Lynch used the kidnapping of Froggy Doo as the basis for a screenplay, and interviewed Herb McAllister (the actor who played Happy Herb and provided Froggy Doo's voice) to gain background information for the script. Lynch and McAllister agreed to a contract which gave exclusive story rights to Lynch and permitted the use of the original Froggy Doo character design in the final film. Lynch contacted Caroline Zelder, a director/producer friend of his, and Zelder agreed to produce the film. Work on the script took roughly two-and-a- half to three years.\\"'Plumm Summer' Filming to Begin Next Month.\\" Associated Press. June 11, 2006. The budget was initially set at $3.5 million.

It was often reported to be written for children in the 1920s by Harry Dixon Loes, but he never claimed credit for the original version of the song, and the Moody Bible Institute where he worked said he did not write it. It was later adapted by Zilphia Horton, amongst many other activists, in connection with the civil rights movement.  History  The origin of the song is unclear, but the phrase \\"This little light of mine\\" appears published in poetry by 1925 by Edward G. Ivins, a writer in Montana.\\"Former S.L. Man Writes Poem for 'Truth N.Y.,\\" Deseret News (Salt Lake CIty, Utah) 28 March 1925, Sat. p. 30 (accessible on newspapers.com)E. G. Ivins, This Way Out, (1927) p. 56 By at least 1933 the song was well known across African American churches when it was mentioned in newspapers as being sung by a chorus at an African Methodist Episcopal conference in Helena, Montana and then various other churches around the United States later that year.\\"Program is Planned at A.M.S. Church in Honor of Dignitary,\\" The Independent-Record (Helena, Montana) 09 Apr 1933, Sun, p. 2 (accessible on newspapers.com)\\"Church Announcements: Second Baptist\\" The Richmond Item (Richmond, Indiana) 21 Oct 1933, Sat, p. 8 (accessible on newspapers.com)\\"Plea for Faith Voiced by Noted Negro Educator,\\" The Montgomery Advertiser (Montgomery, Alabama)08 Dec 1933, Fri, p. 14 (accessible on newspapers.com) In June 1934 John Lomax and Alan Lomax recorded the earliest known recording of the song when they recorded Jim Boyd of Jacksonville, Texas singing at the State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.http://kodaly.hnu.edu/song.cfm?id=673https://www.loc.gov/item/afc9999005.635/ In 1939 Lomax returned to Texas with Ruby Lomax during their Southern States Recording Trip and recorded the song again. This song and others were sung by a black woman, Doris McMurray who was imprisoned at Thomas Goree Unit in Texas and said that she learned the song from her grandmother in Waco.Southern Recording Trip 2- John & Ruby Lomax 1939- Sections 10-22, field notes http://www.bluegrassmessengers.com/southern-recording-trip-2--john--ruby- lomax-1939.aspx She sang the following lyrics, taught to her by her grandmother: This little light o‚Äô mine, I‚Äôm goin‚Äô let it shine Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine. Evrywhere I go, I‚Äôm goin‚Äô let it shine (repeat) Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine. In my neighbor‚Äôs home, I‚Äôm goin‚Äô let it shine (repeat) Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine. Many other verses have been added over the years, including impromptu lines appropriate to the occasion. The song is sung around the world, with the simple lyrics and tune resonating with all ages. Harry Dixon Loes, who studied at the Moody Bible Institute and the American Conservatory of Music, was a musical composer and teacher, who wrote or co-wrote several other gospel songs. He wrote a popular adaptation of the song \\"This Little Light of Mine\\" in the 1940's, but never copyrighted or claimed credit for writing the original, which remains of unknown origin. Often thought of as an African-American spiritual, it can be found in The United Methodist Hymnal, #585, adapted by William Farley Smith in 1987, and in the Unitarian Universalist Hymn Book, Singing the Living Tradition, #118, with harmonies by Horace Clarence Boyer. Themes Some claim the song takes its theme from some of Jesus's remarks to his followers. Matthew 5:14-16 of the King James Version gives: \\"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.\\" The parallel passage in Luke 11:33 of the King James Version gives: \\"No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.\\"\\"The New Sounds for Christ in Zimbabwe ‚Äì This Little Light Of Mine.\\" The Daily Kos, October 6, 2008. Accessed June 7, 2009. Given that the source is unknown and God and Jesus are not mentioned in the words, it is equally possible that the song reflects a global longing to be seen as a good person trying to make the world a better place. Versions The song was sung by Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Godmother of Rock 'N' Roll, as early as 1960. The song has also been secularised into \\"This Little Girl of Mine\\" as recorded by Ray Charles in 1956 and later The Everly Brothers. It has often been published with a set of hand movements to be used for the instruction of children. Under the influence of Zilphia Horton, Fannie Lou Hamer, and others, it eventually became a Civil Rights anthem in the 1950s and 1960s, especially the version by Bettie Mae Fikes. The Kingston Trio recorded it on College Concert in 1962, and The Seekers for their second UK album, Hide & Seekers (also known as The Four & Only Seekers) in 1964. Over time it also became a very popular children's song, recorded and performed by the likes of Raffi in the 1980s from his album Rise and Shine, releasing it as a single. It is sometimes included in Christian children's song books.For example, it is in The Kids Hymnal: 80 Songs and Hymns, Hendrickson Publishers, 2007 Odetta and the Boys Choir of Harlem performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman on September 17, 2001, on the first show after Letterman resumed broadcasting, after having been off the air for several nights following the events of 9/11. Reverend Osagyefo Sekou and other counter-protesters sang \\"This Little Light of Mine\\" defiantly before a crowd of white supremacists and alt-right supporters gathered for the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, VA in 2018. The song featured on Hoyt Axton's 1963 album Thunder 'N Lightnin' named \\"This Little Light\\". LZ7 took their version of the song also named \\"This Little Light\\" to number 26 in the UK Singles Chart. The song is also sung in several scenes of the 1994 film Corrina, Corrina starring Whoopi Goldberg and Ray Liotta. The song was mixed with You Can't Be A Beacon by The Masters V (Later: J.D. Sumner and the Stamps) in 1988. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry chose to end their wedding in May 2018 with a version of the iconic song.

The Twelfth Imam is a Christian fiction book written by Joel C. Rosenberg. It revolves around the story of a CIA operative who destroys Iran's nuclear capability.  Plot  The plot revolves around David Shirazi, a young CIA operative of Persian descent, who is assigned to stop Iran from developing nuclear power. =Background= The story starts in Iran in 1979 during the takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran. Charlie Harper, an American Foreign Service Officer who was outside the embassy during the takeover, and his wife Claire, seek the help of their neighbors, cardiologist Mohammad Shirazi and his wife Nasreen, a translator at the Canadian embassy to escape capture. Through the help of the Canadian embassy and the CIA, the two couples succeed in escaping and making their way to the United States. Dr. Shirazi and his wife later become the parents of David, the main character in the book. =Main plot= The story then jumps to 2001, with teenager David going on a camping trip with his father and brothers, his father's medical colleagues, and Charlie and his daughter Marseille, a teenager to whom David is attracted. At first, David and Marseille do not get along well, but soon become good friends. This friendship turns into a relationship when Marseille kisses David in an A-frame the two discovered a few days earlier. The next day, David and Marseille are in the A-frame again, talking about important subjects such as God, politics and parents. However, when David is not looking, Marseille falls asleep on a bed. David lies beside her and falls asleep as well. A few hours later, the two wake up next to each other. Marseille looks at David with a fiery passion and asks him about what her parents did in Iran in 1979, as she has never heard the story. Still lying down, David explains the ordeal of how the couple escaped illegally from the country. Marseille is fascinated. In the moment, David's watch goes off, signalling it is time for dinner. But Marseille does not want him to leave. She convinces him to stay. In the course of time, the two begin to make out with each other. They enjoy the experience and wake up the next day ready to leave the camping grounds. As the planes come in to pick the group up, the pilot steps out and explains that just a few days earlier, the September 11 attacks had occurred. When Marseille hears this she bursts into tears, as her mother, Claire, was a banker at the World Trade Center. A few weeks later, a memorial service is held for Claire. This is the last time David sees Marseille. He sends her letters that go unanswered. After a few months, David gives up. His grades plummet, he gets into fights often, and even gets sent to juvenile detention. Meanwhile, in Tehran, Iran, a Muslim named Hosseini is taking his children to a military camp. He gives them each a red plastic key and sends them out over a mine field. All the children step on mines and perish. Hosseini has done this so that his children could be martyrs. He is proud of his act when suddenly, he wakes up to realize it was all a dream. He at first thinks it never happened. Then he realizes it was all too real as it occurred 18 years ago. His wife is crying on the floor remembering the loss. Hosseini comforts her when she cries blasphemy to all Muslims. Hosseini steps back a moment, shocked. His wife had just made herself no longer a Muslim. Hosseini goes to his drawer and pulls and a double-action revolver. He shoots his wife, who dies instantly. Hosseini's servants come into the room to find a dead woman on the floor. The body is buried, and Hosseini goes back to sleep. Back with David, on his last day in juvenile detention, a man comes to speak to him. His name is Jack. He is from the CIA and offers David a job to \\"bring Osama bin Laden's head in a box\\". David wants revenge as he figures that Marseille's life was ruined by her mother's death. He wants to kill the man who did it so he accepts the offer. After David finishes his last semester at boarding school in Alabama, Jack comes to pick him up to give him his first assignment to hunt down bin Laden. He does not enjoy the work as much as he had expected. Nor does he like the next assignment, or the next, or the one after that. In the end, seven years of boring jobs come and go. =Aftermath= It is now the present year. David learns of a big assignment coming up. He is briefed for nearly eight hours in a conference room with Eva, a fellow CIA agent, who will be accompanying him. After the briefing is finished, Jack tells the two to \\"get lost\\" for the weekend. Eva leaves to go see her family and David goes to visit his parents. They talk, visit and catch up on each other's news and the weekend is soon over. Just as he is about to leave, his mother gives him a bag of mail addressed to him. One letter particularly stands out as it is from Marseille. It has now been nine years since 9/11 when he last saw her. He is about to open it but stops and puts it in the bag because he is worried that she may be mad at him in the letter. He goes through security and gets onto his flight to Dubai the next day. With some smooth talking, he gets the stewardess to give him the last seat in business class. About halfway through the flight, he goes back to the bag of letters. He finds the letter from Marseille. He is worried about opening it but goes ahead anyway. To his surprise, Marseille is actually coming to Syracuse in a month, and would like to talk with him over coffee. David is thrilled and realizes he still might have a chance. When David arrives in Dubai, Eva greets him and tells him they need to go to Tehran. He would like to call Marseille, but there is no time. They rush to the flight and are soon in Iran. The next day in Tehran, David and Eva meet with the CEO of a major Iranian telecoms company. The man is not very happy and is rather angry with them. He storms off while shouting profanity at his secretary. She is left in shambles but David comforts her and gives her his business card. Time passes and David takes part in a number of different missions. He saves the world from nuclear destruction and links up with Marseille once again, and this is where the book ends.

It was followed by EDO Technology Limited (\\"EDO\\") and David Anthony Jones v Campaign to Smash EDO and Others ([2005] EWHC 2490 (QB)). Two of the defendants, unincorporated associations \\"Smash EDO\\" and \\"Bombs Out of Brighton Campaign\\", were struck out in April 2005 because they were unrepresented.  Introduction  The campaign against EDO MBM began in 2004. The ongoing protests led EDO MBM Ltd, in April 2005, to seek a permanent high court injunction against 14 named protesters and two protest groups, Smash EDO and Bombs out Of Brighton, on grounds of harassment. The intended injunction, brought under Section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, applied to all protesters, not only those named in the court papers (who in any case denied the allegations). Breach of any condition of the civil injunction carried a criminal penalty of up to five years in prison.Cjo - Abstract - Injunctions Enjoining Non-Parties: Distinction Without Difference?  Preliminary issues trial  The High Court proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice, opened up an argument to the defendants of 'preventing war crimes', that allowed them to put forward evidence of EDO's complicity in war crimes, and refer to the International Criminal Court Act. The Brighton protester's war crimes legal argument was taken seriously by the court for the first time. It had previously been dismissed by lower criminal courts in Brighton as beyond their jurisdiction. Although a defence argument that protesters could have been justified in harassing employees of the company to stop a war crime being committed, was rejected by the high court in a preliminary issues trial of November 2005 on the grounds that such crimes could not be prevented over a long term, only in immediate actions to stop imminent and specific crimes, the court accepted that a further defense argument should be open. This was that if the protesters could show they were acting reasonably in the circumstances on the basis of an objective evidential test, then there was a defense that any harassment, if it had taken place, could be lawful. The defendants had collated a dossier of evidence that outlined alleged links between EDO Corp and war crimes which included statements given by witnesses and bombing victims from Palestine. It also included reports from journalists and human rights groups on war crimes in both Iraq and Palestine. A High Court judge praised the detailed document as 'admirable'. The document detailed incidents of war crimes related to air strikes on civilian areas and infrastructure in both Iraq and Palestine, and argued that the attack and invasion of Iraq in March 2003 was itself illegal as a war of aggression in contravention of the UN Charter.  Attorney General's intervention in the case  The barrister David Perry was instructed by the UK Govt Attorney-General Treasury Solicitors Office to defend the legality of the war on Iraq, and apparently bolster EDO's case for the injunction. Perry described the protests and non-violent direct actions (NVDA) in Brighton as 'a mask for anarchy' and suggested that the protesters belief that EDO MBM were complicit in war crimes was imaginary and even dangerous. The written submissions of the AG to the High Court supported EDO MBM's claim that the arms company did not supply Israel with military equipment, yet in a Freedom of Information response in 2006 the British Government admitted that it had simply taken the word of the company on this issue and assumed it to be true even though they had not verified it.UK Indymedia  Crown Colludes With EDO MBM Lies In High Court Despite this intervention by the Attorney-General, the High Court did not accept the Government's argument that taking into account the honest belief of protesters that war crimes had taken place was wrong. The High Court found that if there was an imminent war crime that the protesters believed on reasonable grounds, was about to take place, in which EDO were complicit, then preventative direct action could lawfully be taken against EDO MBM, without waiting for the authorities of the state to intervene. The ruling effectively allowed proportionate direct action against companies by protesters, if the threat of the crime was imminent and specific. 'It was not necessary to show that any crime was actually committed, merely that the course of conduct had been pursued to prevent the commission of crime. Further, it need not be proved that the person to whom the conduct was directed was the person who was about to commit the crime. The word 'prevent' in the provision did not, however, extend to any long term prevention of crime. ' (Independent barristers note on this point here...). On the news of this judgement EDO Corporation's share price dropped dramatically on Wall Street in the following days. The High Court also rejected EDO Corporation's novel claim that even though there may well have been war crimes carried out with its products, the company was protected from prosecution as a supplier to the military by the Royal Prerogative which disallows the domestic courts from making judgements of government foreign policy. In response to this the Judge went so far as to compare the director of the EDO MBM to Bruno Tesch (Chemist) of the Zyclon B case , who was executed for assisting the genocidal policies of the Nazi regime in Germany in the 1940s.  Settlement of the case  In February 2006 in an out of court settlement several defendants who had been represented by lawyers funded by Legal Aid agreed that they would sign undertakings not to not do certain things that they had never done or had any intention of doing, on condition of discontinuance, and that defendants costs of the case were paid by EDO and EDO also pay their own substantial costs, but most importantly of all, that the injunction against all other protesters other than those in court be lifted. This settlement effectively ended the blanket injunction against all protests at the EDO MBM factory in Brighton. It should be also noted that the legally represented defendants had no choice but to sign the undertaking because Legal Aid had become dependent on the offer of such a document by defendants to EDO, as a result of the nervousness of one QC employed by the defendants. The QC made the recommendation of such a settlement to the Legal Services Commission who themselves then made it a condition of continued funding. Legal funding would thus have been withdrawn from the defence case if the represented defendants had not signed the undertakings. The legal action continued against three remaining defendants who were not dependent of Legal Aid so were able to refuse the written undertakings, and the large lump sums they were offered by EDO to sign them. EDO had hoped that these litigants in person would follow the lead of the lawyers, so that the company would not suffer the exposure of an abuse of process hearing against them that had been a major factor in the out of court settlement for the other defendants. EDO's legal team dropped the whole case before the trial started, after a damning High Court judgement in March 2006, where a judge agreed with complaints from the defendants, that EDO had failed to prepare for what had been ordered by the court to be a speedy trial. An earlier judge had decided the interim injunction created serious infringements of protester's ECHR human rights to free speech and association. EDO Corporation agreed to pay the full costs to remaining defendants and included discontinuance against all defendants who had not even come forward to fight the action which thereby prevented EDO from seeking default costs against these invisible individuals.\\" Peace protesters win battle against arms firm\\", The Guardian, May 9, 2006  Legal costs for EDO  As a result of the collapse of the year-long court battle, EDO MBM suffered legal costs of between ¬£1-¬£1.5 million; more than an entire year's profit for the Brighton arms company. Their legal team, from the firm Lawson-Cruttenden & Co, were found by the judge to have abused the legal process by delaying the full trial, and thereby held onto a temporary injunction that was in place till the full trial would decide if a permanent one was necessary.\\"Anti-war pair's injunction lifted\\", BBC, March 23, 2006  See also  * R v Saibene and Others as to 2009 damage to the company  References   External links  * Legal documents related to the EDO Injunction Case (on Smash EDO site) * * Category:High Court of Justice cases Category:2005 in case law Category:2005 in British law Category:Opposition to the Iraq War ","title":"EDO MBM Technology Ltd v Campaign to Smash EDO"},{"id":"10703696","text":"Rose Reilly (born 2 January 1955), whose married name is Rose Peralta, is a Scottish former women's association football player, who represented both the Scottish women's football team and Italian women's football team. Club career At Stewarton: Rose Reilly, aged 9 years old, shows the other children what she can do with a football. Brought up in Stewarton in East Ayrshire, Scotland, Reilly began her footballing career at age seven with local boys' club Stewarton United and at one point attracted the interest of scouts from Glasgow side Celtic. She made her debut for the women's side Stewarton Thistle Ladies in 1965 against the Johnston Red & White Rockets. She also competed in Hughie Green's Women's Football Tournament reaching the regional final, she was also part of the Stewarton side which lifted the inaugural Scottish Cup in 1971 and reached the first WFA Cup final the same year. In 1972 she moved to Westthorn Utd where she won the treble of Scottish Cup, League Cup and the first League championship. Westthorn also reached the WFA Cup final losing 2‚Äì0 to Southampton. A desire to play football professionally saw Reilly move to French professional ladies' side Reims in 1974. The Scottish Women's FA had reacted to criticism from Reilly and two other players, Edna Neillis and Elsie Cook, by banning them sine die. After a six-month spell with Reims, Reilly was bought by A.C.F. Milan and played for the women's professional team for four years, winning two league titles in the process (of an eventual eight she was to win with a variety of Italian sides). Following on from her initial spell with Milan, Reilly continued to play in Italian football until the age of 40, including spells with the ladies' sides of Catania(Italian) Rose Reilly at Jolly Componibili Catania. and Lecce.

The MƒÅori name is , which means \\"yellow cloak\\". The yellow admiral is a member of the family Nymphalidae, the subfamily Nymphalinae as well as the tribe Nymphalini. Description It is a medium-sized butterfly, with a variable wingspan of 48 to 50 mm in Tasmania, and 48 to 55 mm in New Zealand.Some sites say 60mm The upperside of the forewings are dark brown to black toward the outer edges, with three small white patches and a wide, bright yellow bar, and dull red nearer the body. The rear wings are dull red with a black border, and a row of black circles with light blue centres near the edge. thumb The underwings are very different - the rear wing is various shades of brown with cryptic, irregular markings; the underside of the forewing has a blue eyespot on a black background that is highlighted by a yellow area above and below. Distribution and habitat Yellow admirals are relatively common throughout their range wherever their food plants occur. They prefer open country, wastelands and gardens where the stinging nettles, Urtica incisa and Urtica urens are present. It is found at up to 1000 m above sea level. It is a strong, fast flier, and is thought to survive wind-blown travel from Australia to New Zealand, across the Tasman Sea. Life cycle =Eggs= The eggs are light green, ribbed and barrel shaped. They are usually laid singly, sometimes in pairs, onto the nettle leaves that the larva will eat. =Larva= The caterpillars vary from black to grey, yellow-green or brown, with lighter coloured lines and spots running laterally along its back. They are covered in several rows of spiny protrusions. They have six true legs, and ten prolegs. They prefer to eat nettles and, depending upon availability, feed on Urtica incisa, Urtica urens, Parietaria debilis, Pipturus argenteus, Parietaria australis, Parietaria cardiostegia, Parietaria judaica, and Soleirolia soleirolii. They feed at night; during the day they hide in a curled leaf for protection. They grow to about 30 mm long before pupating. The pupa is about 20 mm long and is grey or brownish, with sharp bumps and has two white/silver spots on each side. =Adult= Being long lived they often end up with damaged wing tips. The flight period of the adult covers all the warmer months of the year and so varies with location, e.g. in Tasmania it is from November to May, while in Victoria it is from September to April. Individuals may live for several months. The adults feed on nectar from available flowers, and sometimes sap seepage from trees. Normally the last of the season's brood survive as larvae until the next season, but in some areas it survives as a dormant adult over winter.

Set on the side of a hill 6 km northwest of Sefrou, the village of Bhalil is notable for its unique cave houses located in the old part of the village, and for its eclectically coloured homes, linked together by a network of bridges. Some of the cave houses in Bhalil are routinely open to tourists to visit, but are rapidly disappearing as the village modernizes. A tour of these houses can be arranged with friendly local guides at a nominal fee. Bhalil is also known for its production of Djellaba buttons. Village women can often be found in alleyways, chatting while they diligently work through hundreds of strings and buttons in the creation of traditional Djellaba. The village is also known for its olive oil production, and traditional bread ovens.Ellington, Mark and McVeigh, Shaun. 'The Rough Guide To Morocco'. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1985.  A historic account of marriage ceremonies in Bhalil (as documented by Houcein Kaci)  A mixture of rural and urban practices can be found in traditional marriage ceremonies of Bhalil, with evidence of Berber customs that seem to have disappeared elsewhere, but which are still evident in Bhalil's culture (as of 1921).Kaci, Houcein. ¬´ C√©r√©monies du mariage √† Bhalil. ¬ª H√©sp√©ris. T.1. 1921. Houcein Kaci provides the Berber custom where after a few months of marriage, a bride will leave her husband and return to her ancestral family home for an entire year. Typically, people from Bhalil marry within the village because the two families will be well known to each other. Contrary to traditional customs, the young man approaches the young woman‚Äôs parents (and specifically the father) to ask for his daughter in marriage. In some situations, if the daughter is of a certain age, she is consulted and ultimately allowed to make the decision (however, her father can overrule her if he believes she is making an unwise decision). For the entire engagement, the female fianc√©e does not leave the house, and likewise for three days prior to the wedding day, the male fianc√© remains in an isolated cave with a few select male companions. Henna decorations occur on the second night before the wedding (for both the male and the female ‚Äì her feet and hands are fully covered, and his hands only are decorated). The male fianc√© parades through the city on a highly embellished horse to his future home, where his bride is waiting. Celebrations occur for seven days afterward to celebrate the wedding. The bride cannot leave her bed for seven days after the wedding day, throughout which she is not allowed to see anyone but close family; and the groom continues living in the caves. On the seventh day, a final celebration occurs to mark the end of the wedding and the beginning of their daily life as a married couple. After five months, the wife must leave her husband for a year and return to live in her ancestral home. The husband and wife must not see each other for the entire year; throughout this period, the wife is cloistered, but accompanied by an older woman sent by the bride‚Äôs husband. After the year, the husband gives his in-laws a variety of gifts (generally livestock and eggs) and the husband and wife return to their daily lives. The real name of Bahalil is Bahau El-Lail which is the Night's Glory or Night's √©clat. The traditional pottery techniques and design patterns of Bhalil An article written by J. Herber in 1946 Herber, J. ¬´ Notes sur les poteries √† Bhalil. ¬ª H√©sp√©ris, T.3. 1946. (who visited the area in 1928, with the intent of studying Moroccan pottery techniques and decoration in rural areas) explores the various techniques used by male and female potters from Bhalil. Herber's examination of two male potters found that both used traditional techniques that were specific to Bhalil and the surrounding area due to the type of earth and clay that could be found in the area near the village. The tools and cooking techniques were likewise area specific, and tools were often made by the potter himself, resulting in fairly straightforward and simple designs. Decorations on the pottery were made with either a very fine tip (in straight lines or diamonds) or pieces of reed/the thumb nail to make crescent shapes (these designs are seen to be reminiscent of Saharan sculptors). The pottery made in this area was designed to be functional, as it would be used on a daily basis. Much of the originality of Bhalil potters lie in the designing of their tools and the brazier (mejmar), which varied in design and decoration depending on the potter. Female potters in Bhalil have very different styles of crafting from those of the males. Herber was not able to observe the females in their practice, as he visited in April, and females only traveled in the autumn months to avoid the heat of the summer, but he made note of this custom. Female potters in Bhalil also used local earth, but it was slightly different from those of the males (it was found right in Bhalil itself). The techniques were very similar to other female potters from the Zerhoun region as the earth was modeled on a stand and cooked in the sun; however, the main differences lay in the design of the pottery. Much of the pottery was again made for common, everyday use but it was decorated either externally or internally with black lines and zigzags. Although the pottery done by females in Bhalil was still fairly rustic, it was more often finished more finely than that of the males. Overall, Herber found that the design and techniques used in Bhalil, and Morocco more generally, varied across different areas and tribes. However, there are heavy Berber influences that can be found in the decor of ceramics in North Africa, which are reflected in other artisan styles as well (tattoos, fabric and rug designs of the region).

CNA is a nonprofit research and analysis organization that operates the Center for Naval Analyses and the Institute for Public Research. The CNA Military Advisory Board was founded by Sherri Goodman, former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Environmental Security), who served as the Executive Director of the CNA MAB from its founding in 2007‚Äì2015. General In April 2007, the MAB issued its first report entitled \\"National Security and the Threat of Climate Change.\\" The report projects that climate change will pose a serious threat to America's national security, especially by creating instability in already volatile regions. In May 2009 the MAB issued a report that explores the impact of America's energy choices on our national security policies. This report, titled \\"Powering America‚Äôs Defense: Energy and the Risks to National Security,\\" considers the security risks inherent in our current energy posture; energy choices the nation can make to enhance our national security; the impact of climate change on our energy choices and our national security; and the role the Department of Defense can play in the nation's approach to energy security and climate change. The MAB also released reports in 2010, 2011, and 2014 The May 2014 report, \\"National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change\\" re-examines the impact of climate change on U.S. national security. The most recent MAB report, \\"National Security and Assured U.S. Electrical Power,\\" was released in November 2015. The 2015 report found that \\"the current U.S. electrical grid ‚Äì based on centralized power generation and interconnected and aging distribution architecture ‚Äì is susceptible to a wide variety of threats.\\" 2007 Report Principal Findings The CNA Military Advisory Board looked at the conditions climate changes are likely to produce, how those conditions may affect America's national security interests, and what actions the nation should take to address these consequences. Its principal findings included the following: * Projected climate change poses a serious threat to America's national security. * Climate change acts as a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world. * Climate change, national security, and energy dependence are a related set of global challenges. Recommendations Based on these findings, the Board made several recommendations, including the following: #The national security consequences of climate change should be fully integrated into national security and national defense strategies. The intelligence community should incorporate climate consequences into its National Intelligence Estimate. #The U.S. should commit to a stronger national and international role to help stabilize climate change at levels that will avoid significant disruption to global security and stability. #The U.S. should commit to global partnerships that help less developed nations build the capacity and resiliency to better manage climate impacts. #The Department of Defense should enhance its operational capability by accelerating the adoption of improved business processes and innovative technologies that result in improved U.S. combat power through energy efficiency. #The Department of Defense should conduct an assessment of the impact on U.S. military installations worldwide of rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and other projected climate change impacts over the next 30 to 40 years.

It is one of the \\"trilogies of mountains\\", each of which has a temple with similar layout. The creation of the temple is credited to the reign of Yasovarman I (889‚Äì910)Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, between 9th and 10th centuries; established after he moved his capital to Angkor and named it Yasodharapura. The two other sister temples, named after the contiguous hills, are the Phnom Bakheng and Phnom Krom. The site of the three hills was chosen by Yashovarman I along with the Eastern Baray (where only the base of the central shrine is surviving). In the 10th century, these shrines had high religious value during the Angkorian rule. The temples called as part of an \\"architectural triad\\" brought about an element of experimentation in architectural style in the Angkorian period. From the astronomical references planned for three temples, out of the four noted alignments three, namely, equinox and winter and Solar Solstices could be observed from inside the western entrance of Phnom Bok hill temple, which is also known for the triple sanctuary dedicated to the Trimurti. Geography Map Phnom Bok is the third natural hill site. Its elevation is . The hill is about northeast of Siem Reap. It is approached from the road to Banteay Srei. An eastbound road leads to Banteay Samr√© for another from whence the hill is approached through 635 wide steps leading to the top where the Phnom Bok temple is situated. From the top of this mountain, though the temple is seen mostly in ruins, the panoramic vistas seen all round are of the Tonl√© Sap Lake, the Phnom Kulen to the north and vast plains of rice fields to the south. Like Phnom Krom, Phnom Bok consists of sandstone which has a relatively high magnetic susceptibility. History Yasovarman I, son of Indravarman I (his capital was at Hariharalaya), shifted the capital to Yashodarapura (the first Angkor capital meaning \\"The City That Bears Glory\\"). The temples that he built, apart from Phnom Bok in 910 AD consisted of the Lolei (893 AD), Pra Vihear (893 AD), Phnom Bakheng, the Royal temple (900 AD) and Phnom Krom (910 AD). However, Yashovarman did not choose Phnom Bok as the capital city, near the city of Hariharalaya, as he considered it unsuitable due to its \\"awkward and too high\\" a location to mark as the centre of the city. He did not choose Phnom Krom hill either, as he considered it too close to the Tonle Sap Lake. Eventually, Phnom Bakhen of the triumvirate of hills was chosen as the capital city due its low height and large expanse of land available to establish a capital city. His objective was also to build a temple for housing a linga, which surpassed his father's Indresvara and named it as Yashodaresvara. He also named his capital as Yashodarapura, which became the first capital city of Angkor. He, however, installed the Trimurtis in the temples on the other two hills of Phnom Bok and Phnom Krom. Statues of the Hindu Trimurti were found at both Phnom Bok and Phnom Krom. Architecture Prasat Phnom Bok, rectangular in shape and attributed to the reign of Yasovarman I, is similar in design to the Phnom Krom prasat. However, while the Phnom Krom central tower is higher than the other two flanking towers, the Phnom Bok prasat has three identical sanctum towers in a row on a single terrace. The temple is an Angkor monument. It is dedicated to the Trimurti of the Hindu pantheon: the Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara or Shiva. It was built in Bakheng style (893‚Äì927) and designed with individual sanctums, which have door openings to the east and west. These are raised on a foundation with a plinth made of laterite stone. Frontons of Bakheng and Phnom Bok are said to \\"represent heads of the entire thirty-three deities of the Hindu pantheon. There is said to be a \\"fine example of the head of Shiva in the Chandrasekhara form with the moon prominent on his locks\\" at the temple. The summer solstice occurring over Phnom Bok hill temple, which had the images of Trimurtis defied in it, can be observed from the temple's western entrance. Angkor monuments built in Angkor period architecture in Bakheng style were made of sandstone and laterite but brickwork was also adopted. Laterite has been used for the walls, platforms and pavements. Greyish yellow sandstone was the main stonework used in the temples. Though the temple is in a good condition, there is over growth of two large frangipani (Plumeria) trees over the ruined temple towers. It is said that when the flowers bloom on these trees, the appearance of \\"some sort of extravagant haircut\\" is discerned.

Supermarket Woman was nominated for six Japanese Academy Awards in 1997, including Best Film, Director and Actress, but did not win in any categories. Plot A new supermarket 'Bargains Galore' opens, and threatens the longer-established 'Honest Goro' with its aggressive price cutting. The owner of 'Honest Goro' (Goro, played by Masahiko Tsugawa) inspects the new store, and bumps into an old classmate he hasn't seen for years (Hanako, played by Nobuko Miyamoto). She uses her 'housewife's know-how' to show him why his supermarket is performing so badly. He resolves to make his supermarket the best in Japan, and gives her a job as head cashier. She helps to improve customer service and introduces new sales techniques and a policy of selling only fresh food. However, in doing so she angers senior staff members who don't want to change their ways. However, the store gradually attracts more customers. Meanwhile, the manager of 'Honest Goro' is taking bribes from 'Bargains Galore', and eventually resigns to start work at the new supermarket, trying to take the rest of the staff with him. After an impassioned speech by Hanako, the majority decide to remain loyal to Goro, and redouble their efforts to provide customer satisfaction. In a last- ditch attempt to sabotage Goro, the old manager and the head butcher attempt to steal all the store's meat. Hanako discovers them, and is locked in the back of their freezer van when they drive off. Goro pursues them in a dekotora, and after a high-speed chase Hanako is saved. 'Honest Goro' opens on New Year's Day to a store full of customers, while 'Bargain's Galore' is practically empty.

Although many other houses along Lake Street and Wadhurst Road also have a Tidebrook address. The centre point of the hamlet is the St. John the Baptist Church in the bottom of the valley. Most of the houses within Tidebrook are either old farmhouses or cottages built for farm labourers with the exception of Tidebank Cottage, formerly the Fountain Pub and an old School house, formally Tidebrook School for girls which suffered a fire in the 1960s. Residents The majority of current Tidebrook residents either work in the nearby villages or commute to London although there are still working farms in Tidebrook. The community is still very much intact with events such as horse box carol singing at Christmas and Tidebrook Fete being highlights in the year. Industry From the 16th to the 18th century Tidebrook formed part of the strong local Iron industry, signs of which can still be seen in the area. Wildlife The area remains unspoiled by the nearby expanding towns and villages and there is much wildlife to be seen. In recent years the number of badgers in the area has multiplied.

Scattergood was one of the Philadelphian cricketers that played from the end of the 19th century through the early years of the next. Scattergood was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a prominent Quaker family. He began his sports career as a baseball catcher, but was converted to a wicket-keeper while a student at Haverford College. While at Haverford, Scattergood also played football and tennis and served as the treasurer and secretary of his class. In 1895, he graduated from Haverford with honors in mathematics before going on to more schooling at Harvard University. Following his time at Harvard, Scattergood began a long career as a businessman and philanthropist in the Philadelphia area. It was also at this time that he began playing for the Philadelphian cricket team. Cricket career Henry Scattergood posing at the wicket Having toured in England in 1896 with the visiting team from Haverford, Scattergood's first-class cricket debut came against Gloucestershire on the Philadelphian's 1897 tour of England. Gloucestershire won the match by an innings and 26 runs. In the first innings, Scattergood achieved his high score of 13 and batted for 5 not out in the second innings. He made one catch to dismiss Charlie Townsend. Scattergood played three more matches on this tour before returning to the United States to play visiting side from England. Scattergood also joined the Philadelphians on their tour of England in 1903. He played through the middle of the tour and ended his first-class career with a match against Worcestershire on July 13‚Äì15. Unfortunately, Scattergood was injured shortly after taking the field and replaced. This was the end of a very successful career. The English cricketer Gilbert Jessop declared that \\"the wicket-keeping of Scattergood was every bit as remarkable as was the bowling of Bart King.\\" John Lester wrote that the keeper's \\"services to cricket extended far beyond his play. Always a defender of the faith, and one of those who strove hardest to stem the decline, he is still an influence in keeping it alive.\\" Mountaineering Scattergood was a founding member of the American Alpine Club. He is credited with first ascents in the Canadian Rockies of Mount Vaux, Chancellor Peak, Wapta Mountain, the north summit of Mount Victoria, and Mount Mollison.American Alpine Club Publications - Joseph Henry Scattergood, 1877-1953 In the Selkirk Mountains he climbed Mount Sir Donald, Eagle Peak, and Avalanche Mountain.

The president of YCL is Ganeshman Pun and the general secretary of YCL is Dilip Kumar Prajapati.http://66.116.151.85/wp- content/Ycl.pdfoutlookindia.com The Young Communist League (YCL) was formed by the CPN‚ÄìMaoist at some point (there is no definite information on the year of its creation) during the ‚Äòpeople‚Äôs war‚Äô to support the revolution. Ganeshman Pun, chairman of the YCL, has stated that the League was reactivated in November 2006. According to him, the YCL \\"is a fusion of the Party‚Äôs military and political character, and it is composed of PLA members who have an interest in politics.\\" As the party‚Äôs youth wing, its role is to \\"organise youth, be involved in events, conduct political awareness, and take part in development work as volunteers.\\" Once the CPN-Maoist was proscribed, the YCL was also forced underground. After the April 2006 Jana Andolan (people‚Äôs movement) and the subsequent over-ground role of the insurgents, the CPN- Maoist revived the YCL. Contribution to revolution With the development of the Communist Party in Nepal, different youth organizations were established. These organizations remained on the forefront and played an important role in both mass movements and in the peasants movement. The Akhil Nepal Yuba Sangathan (All Nepal Youth Organization) was established in 1981 under the chairmanship of Comrade Prachanda and it played a positive role in the question of making revolutionary political line. In 1991, it was renamed the Young Communist League (YCL) and during the period of preparation of the People's War, it played an important role in completing the preparation of the People's War. During the People's War it helped the People's War. In the new political context developed after the People's War and the nineteen-day-long Mass Movement, the Young Communist League was established on 2 December 2006. It conducted campaigns to establish a federal republic, and struggle for patriotism and republic and mobilized youth during the election of Constitution Assembly. Leadership and Cadre At its first national convention in the capital Kathmandu in February 2007, which was inaugurated by the CPN-Maoist Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal a.k.a. Prachanda, the YCL formed a 45-member new Central Committee with Ganeshman Pun as its Chairman, Uma Bhujel as its Vice-chairman, Dileep Kumar Prajapati as General Secretary, R. P. Sharma as Secretary and Bhagwat Baduwal as Treasurer. Ganeshman Pun is a senior CPN-Maoist cadre and was the ‚ÄòCommissar‚Äô of the Parivarthan Memorial Ninth Brigade of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA). Uma Bhujel is a PLA ‚Äòsection commander‚Äô famous for leading a successful jailbreak in Gorkha on March 31, 2001, along with five of her associates. Dileep Kumar Prajapati and Bhagwat Baduwal are top ranking commanders in the PLA. Another Central Committee member, Chandra Bahadur Thapa a.k.a. Comrade Sagar, who is in charge of YCL‚Äôs Kathmandu region, is a former ‚Äòbattalion commander‚Äô of the Dinesh- Ramji Samiti Brigade. Senior YCL leader, Sabitri Gurung, is a ‚Äòdeputy battalion commander‚Äô of the PLA. Each of these above-mentioned leaders is a dedicated member of the CPN-Maoist and some allege that they have been appointed to the YCL in order to evade inclusion in the mechanisms for the management of arms and armies by the United Nations. Nanda Kishore Pun, the Maoist Central Committee member and PLA ‚Äòdeputy commander‚Äô, in an interview to Nepali Times conceded, \\"It is true that at present some commanders have been sent to the YCL. They are individuals who were previously active in the YCL and have experience.\\" YCL are unarmed young cadres without any formal military training. It is alleged that some YCL cadres receive some military style training but this has not been widely seen since 2008. Former PLA members who fought during the insurgency era are a minority within the YCL; most members have joined since the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2006. YCL members in many areas enjoy relative impunity from arrest, because of the strength of the UCPN-M and its influence over local officials. In addition to political activities the YCL also engages its cadres in activities such as cleaning localities, cleaning rivers and planting trees. On occasion, they have involved themselves in quasi-policing activities like traffic management, night patrolling, demolition of illegal houses, and the capture of alleged gangsters to help the government for a progressive effort. Imitation of the YCL After the CPN-Maoist formed its youth organization, other parties formed similar youth organizations. The Terai-based regional party, Madeshi Janaadhikar Forum, formed its Madhesi Youth Force. The UML (United Marxist Leninist) formed its ‚ÄòYouth Force‚Äô which was similar to the Young Communist League, Nepal. It was advocating for a ban on organizations like the YCL as a ‚Äòhurdle‚Äô for peace and stability. Ultimately, the CPN-Maoist claimed that mobilization of youth was very much necessary for the enrichment of national integrity and sovereignty in today‚Äôs context . After a defeat in the CA polls held recently which reduced it to a third party, CPN (UML) concluded that their defeat resulted from a lack of youth cadres like the YCL of the CPN- Maoist. Thus, realizing the necessity of such a youth wing, the UML decided to form ‚ÄòYouth Force‚Äô. The media reported that some of the Nepali Congress cadres formed a similar organization in Dolakha, but the Nepali Congress president denied that such a youth force had been formed and claimed that there is no plan of forming anything like the YCL or Youth Force in the future.

They were introduced in the course of the 1960s until 1975. Starting from 1995, all E.444s were upgraded as E.444R. The locomotives are nicknamed Tartaruga (tortoise). The original E.444 class carried a cabside cartoon of a speeding tortoise. History =E.444 standard= The E.444 locomotive was designed in the 1960s as the first Italian electric locomotive capable to reach (in that period first high-speed trains like the Japanese Shinkansen and the French TGV were appearing). Italian railways could boast fast trains like the ETR 200, but they were getting old and the Pendolino project was just in its early phases. The first 4 prototypes, built at Savigliano, made their debut in 1967-1968: their power output was respectable for the time, but they proved unable to hold the fast international services required for the new locomotive, and the bogies were limited to . They proved anyway that Italian industry could produce locomotive capable of more than A speed of was registered on November 8, 1967, in the maiden trip Rome-Milan. The series production saw the introduction of the more powerful T750 motors, which boosted the power to , while the bogies were upgraded for . The frontal part was improved and made more aerodynamic. A characteristic livery with two blue stripes on a pale grey background was adopted. The first 50 units proved successful, and the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) ordered 60 more to be built starting from 1972. 16 units were adapted for feeding at 1.5 kV DC. During 1974 two locomotives (units 056 and 057) were provided with a \\"shunt chopper\\" system (later the modifications applied were rolled back, making the two units identical to standard once again), while in 1975 the E.444.005 adopted a \\"full chopper\\" electronic system, which was later also adopted on the E.632/633 classes, and which granted a peak power. Curiously, the fact that the E.444s were often used on old lines and coupled to not advanced coaches, usually hampered their performances. For example, only with the adoption of second- generation coaches, like the Grand Comfort type, trains driven by E.444 could replace the old ETR 300 in the Milan-Rome fast service. =E.444R= The introduction of fast lines showed the age of the E.444. It was therefore commissioned a program to upgrade all units to a new standard. That stator groups and the braking system were adapted for high speed service, while later it was also decided to update the driving cabin, which had been always noisy at high speed. A new, profiled frontal was thus adopted, together with a pearl grey-red livery.Later changed to the standard white green of FS Trenitalia. The modified units (for a total of 97) were re-christened E.444R (\\"R\\" standing for riqualificazione, meaning \\"re-qualification\\", but also known as \\"Ribollita\\" among personnel, meaning something like \\"Reheated soup\\"). E.444R are in widespread service with FS-Trenitalia for fast Intercity and express services. As part of Trenitalia's plan to retire older types of locomotives (such as the Caimano, Tigro and Tartaruga), the E.444Rs are now undergoing final retirement due to lack of newer safery features. By June 2020, they are no longer used in revenue services, instead being used to tow rolling stock for scrap or work trains.

To subserve this reflex protective function, mechanoreceptive nerves in the periodontal ligament sense tooth movement and project to the mesencephalic nucleus. Likewise, afferent fibers from muscle spindles, the sensory organs of skeletal muscle, are stimulated by the stretch of hard contraction of jaw muscles. The temporomandibular joints and the Golgi tendon organs of the jaw muscles do not project to the mesencephalic nucleus. The mesencephalic nucleus is one of four trigeminal nerve nuclei, three sensory and one motor. The other two sensory nuclei are the chief sensory nucleus mediating conscious facial touch and the spinal trigeminal nucleus, mediating pain and temperature in the head, and is of importance in headache. The trigeminal motor nucleus innervates the muscles of mastication, mylohyoid, anterior belly of digastric, tensor veli palatini, and tensor tympani. Unlike many nuclei within the central nervous system (CNS), the mesencephalic nucleus contains no chemical synapses but are electrically coupled. Neurons of this nucleus are pseudounipolar that receive proprioceptive information from the mandible and send projections to the trigeminal motor nucleus to mediate monosynaptic jaw jerk reflexes. The mesencephalic nucleus is the only structure in the central nervous system to contain the cell bodies of first order sensory neurons. The mesencephalic nucleus can thus be considered functionally as a sensory ganglion embedded within the brainstem, making it neuroanatomically unique .  Development  The pseudounipolar neurons in the mesencephalic nucleus are embryologically derived from the neural crest. However, instead of joining the trigeminal ganglion, the neurons migrate into the brainstem. Clinical significance Clinically, because of its reflex function, the mesencephalic nucleus can be tested with the jaw jerk reflex. Because of its function in oral proprioception, lesions of the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus cause effects on feeding. The mesencephalic nucleus can be thought of simply as the \\"nucleus that keeps your teeth in\\" by preventing one from biting down hard enough to lose a tooth on foods containing eg. bone, cherry seeds, apricot stones etc. See also * Trigeminocerebellar fibers References External links * Washington University Category:Cranial nerve nuclei Category:Trigeminal nerve Category:Proprioception ","title":"Mesencephalic nucleus of trigeminal nerve"},{"id":"10704383","text":"Messiah is a compilation album by American industrial metal band Fear Factory released in 1999 by Roadrunner Records.

It was available for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum, and Game Boy. The Spectrum and Game Boy versions were developed by The Code Monkeys.The Game of Harmony for Game Boy - MobyGames Gameplay The player controls a round spacecraft, and must work to clear all globes from the screen within a time limit. The playing field wraps around at the edges, so a globe or the ship traveling off the left edge (for example) will re-appear on the right. Globes come in three different colors, and those of the same color will disappear when they collide, whereas differing-colored globes will produce small pods, of the third color. Pods can be collected for more energy, but if they are not picked up quickly, they will turn into globes. There are 50 levels of increasing difficulty. On some levels, elastic bands connect certain globes, or even attach the player's ship to one or more globes. Destroying a globe will remove any elastic band attached to it. In other areas, barriers block the movement of the player and the globes.allgame ((( The Game of Harmony > Overview ))) On difficulty settings above \\"easy\\", the globes are somewhat volatile. If they are not cleared within a certain time of their appearance, they will explode and damage the player's ship. If the ship loses enough energy, it is destroyed. There are two kinds of bonus levels, both containing only pods, not full-sized spheres. One bonus level has yellow and blue pods, both of which can be collected, but only blue pods earn points. Collecting a blue pod causes a yellow pod to turn blue. Another bonus level has blue and red pods. Collecting a blue pod earns points, while collecting a red pod ends the bonus level immediately. There are also hidden bonuses available during the game; for example, completing a level by not rotating right earns extra bonus points. The player's spaceship is operated by polar control, as in Spacewar! or Asteroids: moving the joystick left or right rotates the ship, and pressing the Fire button makes it thrust in whatever direction it is facing. The game's distinguishing feature is its realistic model of kinetics. Objects colliding with each other change their speed and direction in a realistic manner, and the elastic bands affect movement in a realistic fashion as well. The \\"E\\" in E-Motion stands for Einstein, and he appears in cover art and advertisements.

He commanded the 3rd Independent Highland Company from 1714 to 1716, fought at the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719, led the 6th Company in formation of the \\"Black Watch\\" in 1725, the 8th Company of Black Watch when it was regimented in 1739 and again commanded an Independent Highland Company in 1745-46. He was shot in error in 1746. Lineage George Munro of Culcairn was born on 18 September 1685,Mackenzie, Alexander (1898). p. 159. the second son of Sir Robert Munro, 5th Baronet of Foulis, chief of the Clan Munro, who was also known as the Blind Baron. George's elder brother was Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet of Foulis, the next successive chief of the clan.Mackenzie, Alexander (1898). p. 159. Jacobite rising of 1715 During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the Mackenzie Jacobite garrison at Inverness surrendered to Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat upon the very day when the Battle of Sheriffmuir was fought and another Jacobite force was defeated at the Battle of Preston (1715). Soon after this 31-year-old Colonel Sir Robert Munro of Foulis marched into the town of Inverness with 400 Munros and took over control as governor from Fraser. Government troops arrived in Inverness towards the end of February, and for some months the process of disarming the rebels went on led by a Munro detachment under George Munro of Culcairn.Mackenzie, Alexander. (1898). The History of the Munros of Fowlis. pp. 104 - 107. Jacobite rising of 1719 During the Jacobite rising of 1719, Captain George Munro of Culcairn led a detachment of Munros at the Battle of Glen Shiel where they helped to defeat the Jacobites. During the battle George who was wounded was shielded by his servant, however he told his men to carry on and not to shield him. The Jacobites continued to fire at George after he was down, until Sergeant Robert Munro, son of Hugh Munro of Tullochue, with a small party, dislodged Captain George Munro's assailants, after having previously swore upon his dirk that he would effect his rescue. The Jacobites were soon put into retreat and after the battle the Jacobite rising was over. Historian Peter Simpson states that the Munro company ably led by George Munro of Culcairn took a very positive part in the fighting and that their bold action helped in the defeat of the Jacobites under the Earl Marischall.Simpson. pp. 155. Simpson also states that the battle raged for three hours but the superior power of the Government grenadiers along with the aggressive forays of the Munros won the day for the Government.Simpson. pp. 103. Formation of the Black Watch and War in France In 1725 six Independent Highland Companies were formed. One of Munros, one of Frasers, one of Grants and three of Campbells. George Munro of Culcairn was made a Captain in Munro's company under his elder brother Colonel Sir Robert.Simpson. pp. 113. In 1739 ten Independent Highland Companies were embodied into a regiment of the line.Simpson. pp. 116 - 117. The regiment then was officially known as the 43rd Highlanders (later renumbered the 42nd and also known as the \\"Black Watch\\" ). The regiment's first action together came at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 against the French, however George Munro of Culcairn had retired from the regiment in 1744. Jacobite rising of 1745 During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Munros continued their support for the British Government. George Munro was appointed the command of the Munro Independent Highland Company.Simpson. pp. 127 ‚Äì 128 and 130. While his elder brother, Robert Munro, now the chief of the clan was appointed command of the English 37th Regiment of Foot and Robert's son, Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet held command in Loudon's Highlanders regiment. General Sir John Cope arrived at Inverness on 29 August 1745.Munro, R.W. (1977). Clan Munro Magazine No. 14. George Munro of Culcairn met him and agreed that the Munros \\"should instantly take arms and join the King's troops\\". Harry Munro joined Sir John Cope at the Water of Nairn and when the army marched for Aberdeen on 4 September Loudon's Highlanders regiment included his three companies, while George Munro of Culcairn's detachment acted as scouts. Sir John Cope remained in Aberdeen where a fourth company of Loudoun's regiment joined the others until 14 September from whence they sailed to Dunbar and their infamous defeat at the Battle of Prestonpans. Harry was among 70 officers taken prisoner and for a time was imprisoned in Glamis Castle but by mid January 1746 he was among 31 men released who arrived at Edinburgh, where he learnt the tragic news of his father Robert's and his uncle Duncan's deaths after the Battle of Falkirk Muir. Meanwhile, the main body of 200 Munros,MacLeod, Ruairidh. p. 314. having escorted Sir John Cope successfully to Aberdeen had returned to the north under George Munro of Culcairn and were not present at Prestonpans. However, George Munro and his Independent Company seem to have been involved in the events which led up to the Battle of Inverurie (1745) if not involved in the battle itself. One account does state that the Munros under George Munro of Culcairn were positioned in such a way that they were able to attack the advancing Jacobites from the front and flank leaving many dead on the field.Mackenzie, Alexander. (1989). pp. 108 - 109. Another account states that the Munros held position at the village of Oldmeldrum and were not involved in the battle at all. John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun and Sir John Cope had escaped by sea to London after the Battle of Prestonpans from whence Loudoun later returned north to Inverness to take command in the north but was forced with Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden and George Munro of Culcairn to withdraw through the Black Isle into Ross-shire being pressed by a much larger Jacobite force. According to historian Ruairidh MacLeod, at this time George Munro of Culcairn was the most experienced military man in the north. After the Battle of Falkirk (1746), Mackenzie Jacobites had burned Foulis Castle leaving it a semi ruin. In April of that year the Jacobite army was finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden by Government forces but although Loudon's regiment were present Harry Munro was listed as missing on leave and George Munro of Culcairn had already returned north. Assassination Lord Albermarle dated 23 October 1746 that reads Yesterday there was a meeting of the Camerons about five miles from this, Lochiel's brother was there & the person who tells me of it says, they have resolved to lay hold on the villain who murdered (George Munro of) Culcairn and give him up to the Justice when found, unless this be done they expect a visit from the whole race of Monros (Munros).\\"Return of Loudoun's Regiment and 2 Independent Companies, quartered in the Highlands\\". Ref: SP 54/34/4E, The National Archives, Kew, Richmond, Greater London. After the Jacobite rising had been suppressed a Munro Independent Company under Harry Munro of Foulis and the command of his uncle, George Munro of Culcairn continued to police the Highlands. George Munro and his Independent Company burned Achnacarry Castle,MacLeod, Ruairidh. p. 344. which was the seat of the Clan Cameron, watched by Donald Cameron, chief of the Clan Cameron. The Camerons had been the most staunch of Jacobites and were also responsible for the murder of George's elder brother Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet after the Battle of Falkirk. Around the same time that Achnacarry Castle was burned a Government officer from the Clan Grant, seized a young man by the name of Cameron, who had been sent by his father, Dugald Roy Cameron, to Fort William to surrender their arms.Mackenzie, Alexander. (1898). pp. 112 - 113. Grant shot the young Cameron on the spot. The young Cameron's father swore to be revenged on what had happened to his son and had heard that Grant rode a white horse and waited for him behind a rock on his return from Loch Arkaig. Captain George Munro of Culcairn had borrowed Grant's horse and as a result was shot and killed in mistake for him by Cameron. Some information on George Munro of Culcairn's murder is given by historian Ruairidh MacLeod.MacLeod, Ruairidh. pp. 348 - 349. MacLeod states that on 19 August, Lord Loudon (John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun) ordered Munro to sweep through Knoydart and into Lochaber. On 31 August, Munro's four companies met up with Captain Grant's detachment at Locharkaigside where Munro was killed. The Reverend John Cameron maintained that Munro was shot in mistake for Captain Grant of Knockando, in revenge by the father of a man killed on the orders of Grant. Lord Albermarle reported that the murderer of Culcairn was John Roy McFie who was frequently called John Roy Cameron and who lived at Auchinsoul on North Arkaigside.MacLeod, Ruairidh. p. 349 - 350. The MacGillonies (who were a branch or sept of Clan Cameron),MacGILLONIE, MacGUILLONIE, MacGILLERY, MacONIE, STRONACH clan-cameron.org. Retrieved December 19, 2017. later delivered up a suspect called Evan Bane as a scapegoat, Lord Loudoun reacted angrily ordering Cameron of Fassefern to find the right man within ten days. Another suspect was the Jacobite Grant of Moy whose lands had been burnt and plundered by George Munro of Culcairn. Grant of Moy had been walking along the road with a gun when Munro of Culcairn was shot, but a turn in the road concealed him from the soldiers when the shot was fired. He was immediately seized under suspicion by the soldiers and taken to Fort William, but later released. Grant of Moy later joined the 42nd Regiment of Foot as a volunteer soldier of fortune and afterwards got a cadet-ship in India, returning with a handsome fortune. Family George's son, John Munro, 2nd of Culcairn is also well remembered for the unusual hospitality he showed to a Jacobite Bishop in the 1760s.Fraser, C.I of Reeling. (1954). pp. 10 - 11. It is recorded how John Munro of Culcairn treated him to the best of Strong Ale, Claret of Vintage 49 and good Coffee made of his own Wheat. The Bishop also described Culcairn's improvements: his grounds produce the best of Wheat and he has erected a Flour-Miln for dressing it.

History  Puerto As√≠s was founded on May 3, 1912 by the Capuchins Missionaries, led by Father Estanislao de las Cortes and Brother Hidelfonso de Tulc√°n. The city bears the name of Saint Francis's birthplace--Assisi. In order to reaffirm the sovereignty of Colombia in the territories that were contested by Peru, the government located programs in the region that contributed to the town's growth. By April 1914, the village had a population of more than 200; however, excluding children, women, or indigenous people. The population continued to increase. The mission opened a boarding school for the education of the local indigenous population and the colonists' children. Later that same year, The Franciscan Sisters took charge of the school.

Life Adelbert, first mentioned in a 1033 deed, was born at Ballenstedt Castle in the Saxon Schwabengau, the son of Count Esico of Ballenstedt (d. about 1060) and his wife Matilda, probably a daughter of Duke Herman II of Swabia. About 1068 he married Adelaide of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde, a daughter of Margrave Otto I of Meissen and his wife, Adela of Louvain. Their two sons were: * Otto the Rich ( ‚Äì 1123), Count of Ballenstedt *Siegfried ( ‚Äì 1113), Count of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde, Count Palatine of the Rhine from 1095/97. Adalbert was the heir to extended possessions and rose to one of the leading Saxon nobles. In 1069 he was appointed count in Nordth√ºringgau, later also in the Saxon Eastern March. According to the chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld, Adalbert supported Margrave Dedi I in his 1069 conflict with King Henry IV. Dedi, a member of the House of Wettin, had married Adalbert's mother-in-law Adela of Louvain, widow since 1067, and claimed the Thuringian possessions of her deceased husband Margrave Otto of Meissen. Their revolt found little support; both had to surrender in short order and were pardoned in 1070, Adalbert however remained a fierce opponent of the king. From 1072 on he participated in the Saxon Rebellion led by Count Otto of Nordheim and Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt, for which he was arrested after King Henry's victory in the 1075 Battle of Langensalza. Even after his release about two years later, he backed the German anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden until he was finally killed, possibly in a feud, at Westdorf near Aschersleben by the Saxon noble Egeno II of Konradsburg. Adalbert's widow Adelaide married Count Palatine Hermann II of Lotharingia from the Ezzonid dynasty and ‚Äì in her third marriage ‚Äì Count Palatine Henry of Laach from the House of Luxembourg, father of her son Siegfried.

In 1910, the Birmingham Mail launched an appeal to erect a statue to Edward VII, in order to commemorate his reign. Over ¬£5,000 was quickly raised and an area was allocated within Birmingham Children's Hospital (then located on Ladywood Road near Five Ways) for its location. Albert Toft was commissioned to craft the statue but the project immediately ran into problems. The statue was to be over six feet tall, making it difficult to find a large enough piece of Carrara marble for its construction. This problem was overcome and the project was well underway through 1912.Public Sculpture of Birmingham: Including Sutton Coldfield, George Thomas Noszlopy, 1998, Liverpool University Press () The statue was unveiled in Victoria Square on St George's Day, 23 April 1913 by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. It stood next to a statue of Queen Victoria. However, soon afterwards these statues were criticised as being of \\"ill matched designs\\".The Builder: Art beneath the rule of commerce, May 1, 1914, vol. 106 The statue of Edward VII was eventually moved to Highgate Park (at ) when Victoria Square was remodelled in 1951. The statue was the subject of theft in the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with the theft of Saint George's lance and then the three bronze groups in 1985 and 1986, none of which have been recovered. Following successful lobbying by the Victorian Society, Birmingham City Council agreed to restore the statue and resite it back in the city centre. On 12 June 2007, the Society launched an appeal fund to contribute towards the programme of works which raised almost ¬£12,000, more than 10% of the final cost of restoration. Work by Cliveden Conservation in Bath began in 2009. A new sceptre and orb capital and the three bronzes (representing, respectively, Peace, Education and Progress, and St George slaying the dragon beneath a stylised crown) were re-made, and the monument reassembled on its original plinth, outside Baskerville House in Centenary Square.

Commonly in machine learning, a generalized model must be selected from a finite data set, with the consequent problem of overfitting - the model becoming too strongly tailored to the particularities of the training set and generalizing poorly to new data. The SRM principle addresses this problem by balancing the model's complexity against its success at fitting the training data. This principle was first set out in a 1974 paper by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis and uses the VC dimension. In practical terms, Structural Risk Minimization is implemented by minimizing E_{train} + \\\\beta H(W), where E_{train} is the train error, the function H(W) is called a regularization function, and \\\\beta is a constant. H(W) is chosen such that it takes large values on parameters W that belong to high-capacity subsets of the parameter space. Minimizing H(W) in effect limits the capacity of the accessible subsets of the parameter space, thereby controlling the trade-off between minimizing the training error and minimizing the expected gap between the training error and test error. The SRM problem can be formulated in terms of data. Given n data points consisting of data x and labels y, the objective J(\\\\theta) is often expressed in the following manner: J(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{1}{2n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(h_{\\\\theta}(x^i) - y^i)^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\\\theta_j^2 The first term is the mean squared error (MSE) term between the value of the learned model, h_{\\\\theta}, and the given labels y. This term is the training error, E_{train}, that was discussed earlier. The second term, places a prior over the weights, to favor sparsity and penalize larger weights. The trade-off coefficient, \\\\lambda, is a hyperparameter that places more or less importance on the regularization term. Larger \\\\lambda encourages sparser weights at the expense of a more optimal MSE, and smaller \\\\lambda relaxes regularization allowing the model to fit to data. Note that as \\\\lambda \\\\to \\\\infty the weights become zero, and as \\\\lambda \\\\to 0, the model typically suffers from overfitting.

His first major win was the 17th stage of the 2008 Vuelta a Espa√±a. He also won the third stage of the 2010 Giro d'Italia. He died in a crash during the third stage of the 2011 Giro d'Italia. Career In September 2004, Wouter Weylandt became a member of the team , participating in the Memorial Rik Van Steenbergen, Grote Prijs Jef Scherens and Circuit Franco-Belge, where he took twelfth place. He was part of the Belgian team in the under-23 category at the 2005 UCI Road World Championships. Weylandt turned professional for in 2005, but this first professional season was marred by mononucleosis detected at the beginning of the year. Towards the end of the season, he won the , and finished fifth at the Memorial Rik Van Steenbergen event and the National Award, demonstrating his excellent sprinting qualities. In 2006, his first full season, he finished fifth in the Three Days of West Flanders, then second in the Nokere Koerse, where he won the bunch sprint behind Bert Roesems. During this season, he failed to achieve any victories, apart from the small GP Vichte, but showed great consistency in the sprint, in particular, winning the points classification of the Tour of Poland and finishing fifth in the Championship of Flanders. In 2007, Weylandt won further victories. In March, he won a stage of the Three Days of West Flanders, which he finished second overall, 5 seconds behind Jimmy Casper. Two weeks later, he won the Tour of Groene Hart, then finished fourth in the Grand Prix de l'Escaut. On good form, he won three more stage wins during the rest of the season in the Tour of Belgium, the Ster Elektrotoer and the Eneco Tour. Finally, during the Tour of Poland, he took advantage of a good performance with his team in the team time trial of the 1st stage to take the leader's yellow jersey for a day. 2008 began just as well for Weylandt. He won the sprint in Nokere Koerse, and finished second in the Tour of the Groene Hart, defeated by Tomas Vaitkus. In April came one of the best performances of his career on the one-day races, finishing third in the classic Gent‚ÄìWevelgem behind √ìscar Freire and Aurelien Clerc after a fierce sprint. Late in the 2008 season, Weylandt took part in the Vuelta a Espa√±a, his first grand tour. He participated as lead-out rider for team leader Tom Boonen, but when he dropped out Weylandt seized his chance and won the 17th stage in Valladolid. Building on the momentum of this victory, he took his fourth win of the season on the Omloop van de Vlaamse Scheldeboorden two weeks later. Following the death of his friend Frederiek Nolf at the Tour of Qatar in February 2009, Weylandt won two more victories early in the season. He won the Memorial Jos√© Samyn race after a breakaway with Remi Cusin, and four days later, he won another stage of the Three Days of West Flanders. He finished eleventh in Paris‚ÄìRoubaix in April. In the absence of satisfactory results in late 2009 and early 2010, he was publicly criticized by the Quick Step manager Patrick Lefevere. In May, he won the sprint of the third stage of the Tour of Italy. Suffering from gastroenteritis requiring hospitalization, he left the race a few days later. Although his contract at was not renewed, he gained a contract with another UCI ProTeam squad, the newly formed . He was the second ranked sprinter on the squad, behind Daniele Bennati, and was placed in the team's squad for the 2011 Giro d'Italia as Bennati's lead-out rider. Bennati dropped out of the race line-up a few days before the start, meaning Weylandt entered the contest as the team's main sprinter. Death In stage 3 of the 2011 Giro d'Italia, Weylandt crashed while descending the , in the frazione Isola di Borgonovo, municipality of Mezzanego, suffering a fatal injury. With some 17 km of the stage remaining, riders were going downhill in the final part of the descent, Weylandt trailing the main peloton, going perhaps . According to Manuel Antonio Cardoso (a Team RadioShack rider who was trailing Weylandt), Weylandt looked back over his left shoulder at other riders before a slight left bend. Weylandt lost control and hit the leading edge of a low concrete guard rail on the left side of the road with his foot and pedal. He was thrown to the right side of the road, where he hit another obstacle. The medical chief of staff of the Giro, Dr. Tredici, was right behind the accident in a service car and reported that he ran to Weylandt less than 20 seconds after the crash but, he said on Sky News, \\"...he was already and clearly dead upon impact. I had never seen such a thing before, such a sudden death.\\" Tredici also reported about the very severe trauma Weylandt's contact with the wall had caused him: had Weylandt survived, injuries to his left foot and lower leg would likely have necessitated their amputation. The Giro d'Italia medical team and Garmin's team doctor performed resuscitation attempts for around 45 minutes, drying Weylandt's lungs, infusing liquids to counteract his large blood loss, and administering adrenaline and atropine to support and restart his heart beat and respiration. Meanwhile, an emergency team was rushing to the incident by helicopter. Upon their arrival, Weylandt was declared dead at the scene due to facial and basal skull fractures, as his injuries were too severe to allow resuscitation. It was determined that his heart had stopped immediately upon impact. Forensic exams the next day found extensive internal organ damage. This autopsy confirmed that the cyclist was \\"dead on the spot and did not suffer.\\" Weylandt was wearing a helmet, as all professional road cyclists have been obliged to do since May 2003. Weylandt was the fourth rider to die in the history of the Giro d'Italia. Weylandt was survived by his girlfriend, An- Sophie, who, at the time of the crash, was five months pregnant with the couple's first child. Their daughter, Aliz√©e, was born on September 1, 2011. = Tributes = In tribute to Weylandt, the following day's stage of the race was neutralized, with teams taking turns to ride in front, and all riders wearing black armbands. A Bersaglieri band performed \\"Il Silenzio\\" at the beginning of the stagehttps://www.velowire.com/article/446/en/giro-d- italia-2011--in-commemoration-of-wouter-weylandt--team-leopard-trek-leaves- the-race.html, while supporters held up condolence messages and replicas of Weylandt's race number, 108, as a token of respect along the route. Church bells tolled in mourning all along the stage. The Leopard Trek team was allowed to cross the finish line first, along with Weylandt's training partner Tyler Farrar, riding for Garmin-Cerv√©lo, who linked arms as they finished the race. Farrar withdrew completely from the race at the finish of the stage and the next day the whole Leopard Trek team also announced their withdrawal. Weylandt's race number 108 has been retired from use in the Giro. On 4 July 2011, Farrar formed a two-handed 'W' as he crossed the line to win the third stage of the Tour de France, again as a tribute to Weylandt. Before the start of the third stage of the 2012 Giro d'Italia, a short ceremony was held and a minute's silence was observed. On 9 May 2013, the second anniversary of Weylandt's accident, the winner of the 6th stage of the 2013 Giro d'Italia, Mark Cavendish, held aloft Weylandt's race number, 108, in remembrance while standing on the victor's podium.

It is based on The Importance of Being Earnest, Oscar Wilde's classic 1895 comedy of manners. Background The two-act musical is an expanded version of the hour-long musical Who's Earnest? televised on The United States Steel Hour in 1957.Suskin, Steven. \\"On the Record: Ernest In Love, Marco Polo, Puppets and Maury Yeston\\" , Playbill.com, August 10, 2003. The 1959-1960 Off-Broadway season included a dozen musicals and revues including Little Mary Sunshine, The Fantasticks (based on an obscure 1894 work by Edmond Rostand, of Cyrano fame), and Ernest in Love, a musicalization of Oscar Wilde's 1895 hit. The production was directed by Harold Stone and choreographed by Frank Derbas. It opened on May 4, 1960, at the Gramercy Arts Theatre, where it was warmly received by the critics but ran for only 103 performances. The cast included Louis Edmonds as Algernon, John Irving as Jack, Leila Martin as Gwendolen, Gerrianne Raphael as Cecily, Sara Seegar as Lady Bracknell, Lucy Landau as Miss Prism, George Hall as Dr. Chausable, Christina Gillespie as Effie, and Alan Shayne as Lane. It was then revived thereafter in stock and amateur productions, at least into the early 1960s. An original cast recording was released by Columbia Records. In 2003, a compact disc transfer was issued on the DRG label. The Japanese all-female musical theatre troupe Takarazuka Revue staged the musical in 2005 in two productions, one by Moon Troupe (featuring the debut of Jun Sena and Kanami Ayano) the other one by Flower Troupe (the last production for Sakiho Juri for the company), and the other one by Flower Troupe (lead by Rio Asumi and featuring the debut of Maria Kano). In 2010, an Off Broadway revival of Earnest in Love was presented by the Irish Repertory Theatre. Synopsis ;Act I In Victorian era London, tradesmen and valets debate the upper class's failure to pay their bills on time, with the tradesmen accusing, and the valets fervently defending, their employers (\\"Come Raise Your Cup\\"). Lane, a valet, returns home to find his master, Ernest Worthing, rehearsing the proper words to say to Miss Gwendolen Fairfax, to whom he intends to propose that afternoon (\\"How Do You Find the Words?\\"). Gwendolen, meanwhile, with the help of her maid Alice, is searching for \\"The Hat\\" that will impress Mr. Worthing enough to elicit a proposal. Ernest visits his friend Algernon Moncrieff, who accuses him of leading a double-life. While in the country, where he lives, Ernest goes by the name of Jack (which he believes to be his real name) and pretends that he has a wastrel brother named Ernest, who lives in London and requires his frequent attention. Jack must assume a serious attitude for the benefit of his young ward, Cecily, an 18-year-old heiress and granddaughter of Jack's late adoptive father. When in the city, he becomes the profligate Ernest. Algernon explains to Jack that he has an imaginary friend named Bunbury who lives in the country and is frequently in ill health: whenever Algernon wants to avoid an unwelcome social obligation, or just get away for the weekend, he \\"visits his sick friend\\". He calls this delightful practice \\"Bunburying\\" (\\"Mr. Bunbury\\"). Gwendolen and her mother Lady Bracknell come to call, and Jack proposes to Gwendolen (\\"Perfection\\"). She joyously accepts, but Jack is worried that Gwendolen seems to love him largely for his name, Ernest, which she thinks the most beautiful name in the world. In addition, Gwendolen's mother, the terrifying Lady Bracknell, does not approve of Ernest and is further horrified to learn that he was adopted as a baby after being discovered in a handbag at a railway station (\\"A Handbag is not a Proper Mother\\"). She advises him to find one or both parents before the season is out. Meanwhile, Jack's description of his pretty ward Cecily has so appealed to Algernon that he resolves to meet her, in spite of Jack's firm opposition. Assuming the identity of Ernest, Algernon visits Jack's house in the country. Cecily has for some time imagined herself in love with the mysterious Ernest, whom Jack has told her is \\"A Wicked Man\\". Her governess, Miss Prism, is easily distrated by the attentions of the clergyman Dr. Chasuble (\\"Metaphorically Speaking\\"). Jack, meanwhile, has decided to put his life as Ernest behind him. He is forced to abandon his intention to declare that his brother Ernest has died in Paris by the presence of Algernon in the role of \\"Ernest\\", who threatens to expose Jack's double life if the latter doesn't play along. ;Act II Lane, the valet, and Cecily's maid Effie, lament the way the upper classes make love so difficult (\\"You Can't Make Love\\"); as servants, they find it much easier together. Cecily is swept off her feet by Algernon, and she accepts his proposal (\\"Lost\\"). Cecily admits to her \\"Ernest\\" that she loves him at least in part for his name. Algernon and Jack, unbeknownst to each other, each ask the local rector, Rev Canon Chasuble, to be baptised as \\"Ernest\\". Gwendolen flees London and her mother to be with her love. When she and Cecily meet for the first time, she declares that she can always recognize a lady and knows immediately that she and Cecily will be great friends (\\"My Very First Impression\\"). Upon discussing their engagements, though, each indignantly insists that she is the one engaged to \\"Ernest\\". This results in verbal conflict until Jack and Algernon appear and their deceptions are exposed. Since neither is named Ernest, the girls renounce their engagements and walk away, their noses in the air. Jack deplores their situation, but Algernon calmly consumes his tea (\\"The Muffin Song\\"). The couples soon reconcile when the girls learn of Jack and Algernon's plans to be christened. They all swear \\"Eternal Devotion\\". Lady Bracknell arrives in pursuit of her daughter. She meets Cecily and finds her as a suitable wife for Algernon, especially when the amount in her trust fund is revealed. However, Lady Bracknell still refuses to countenance Jack's marriage to Gwendolen, while he, in retaliation, denies his consent to the marriage of his heiress ward Cecily to her penniless nephew Algernon (\\"The Muffin Song (reprise)\\"). The impasse is broken by the appearance of Cecily's governess, Miss Prism. As she and Lady Bracknell recognize each other with horror, it is revealed that, when working many years previously as a nursemaid for Lady Bracknell's late sister, Miss Prism had disappeared with the sister's child, a baby boy. Miss Prism reveals that, in a moment of distraction, she had placed the baby in a handbag and put the manuscript of a novel she had been writing in the perambulator. The handbag was left at Victoria station and, when she realised her mistake, Miss Prism had fled. When Jack produces the handbag in which he was found, it becomes clear that he is Lady Bracknell's nephew and Algernon's older brother. Dr. Chasuble remembers that Jack was named after his father, Ernest John. Jack, now truly Ernest, receives Gwendolen's forgiveness for the fact that he has been telling the truth all along. The happy couples embrace, including Miss Prism and her clerical admirer, the Reverend Canon Chasuble (\\"Ernest in Love\\").

No, it's not Wilde, but if you can keep from breaking out in a cheek-to-cheek grin when Jack Worthing ... launches into a neat little soft shoe in the first scene, you're just a sour old crock.\\" He noted that, while \\"the music is craftsmanlike but not quite memorable\\", the show \\"works flawlessly on its own modest terms.\\"Teachout, Terry.

Organized in 2003 by John 'Buck' Ormsby and Kent Morrill, founding members of The Wailers, LouieFest is an annual fundraising event for the Wailers Performing Arts Foundation which provides scholarships, instruments, music lessons and mentoring for youth music education. LouieFest is the namesake of \\"Louie Louie\\", the most recorded rock song in history as documented by music historian Peter C. Blecha. According to Blecha's records and research, ‚ÄúLouie Louie‚Äù celebrated its 50-year mark in April, 2007 with 1,600 known recordings. The legacy of this rock and roll song phenomenon is traced directly to The Wailers of Tacoma, Washington. Rockin‚Äô Robin Roberts (1940-1967), the unnamed vocalist of The Wailers, collaborated with founding member and lead guitarist, Richard Dangel (1942-2002) to write an arrangement of the Richard Berry Jamaican sea shanty from the B-side of a 45-single he found in a record store for ten cents. ‚ÄòRockin‚Äô Roberts interjected one single phrase that is said to have changed rock music forever: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs give it to ‚Äòem right now.‚Äù This immortal idiom helped launch ‚ÄúLouie Louie‚Äù to the top of rock and roll fame, and subsequently inspired countless garage bands the world over. The Wailers released ‚ÄúLouie Louie‚Äù in 1961 on their own label, Etiquette Records, history's first artist-owned label by a garage band. They achieved a huge regional hit with the single. The Kingsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, are credited with later recordings of ‚ÄúLouie Louie‚Äù resulting in chart-topping, national exposure. Etiquette Records also pioneered the career of another notable Northwest garage band, The Sonics, who expanded the white rhythm and blues sound. LouieFest celebrates the legacy of the much bemused three-chord sensation by closing every festival with the audience participating as an ensemble, playing ‚ÄúLouie Louie‚Äù in unison, rock and roll's eternally youthful anthem of the Baby Boomer generation.

In an essay called \\"London Grandeur\\"In Blending Genders, edited by Richard Ekins and Dave King, Routledge 1996 Phaedra Kelly says that de Lambray claimed she would be \\"the most famous transgenderist ever and die dramatically at the age of 30\\". Early life De Lambray was born in Herefordshire and attended a public school, before running away to London while still a teenager. There, she became a sex worker and worked as a female impersonator. Life in London De Lambray claimed she was addicted to the idea of becoming famous. She regularly hired a Rolls Royce with the funds she received from prostituting herself in Shepherd Market in London's West End. She would place a large \\"Vicky de Lambray ‚Äì Entertainer\\" sign in the back of the Rolls and drive for hours around central London or park outside Harrods. De Lambray once changed her name by deed poll to Louis de Rothschild, hoping she would be confused as a Rothschild family member. The Rothschild family paid her ten thousand pounds to change it back. De Lambray was often in the headlines because of court appearances, sex scandals and claims that she was a spy. In March 1983, a senior British civil servant, Sir James Dunnet, was questioned by Scotland Yard detectives over a brief sexual encounter he had had with de Lambray in the early years of his retirement. Official concern over this liaison stemmed from the claim of the prostitute that a Soviet spy had also been among her clients at that time, a circumstance which might, given Dunnet's former position at the Ministry of Defence, have constituted a security risk. In the event, Ministry of Defence officials satisfied themselves that Dunnet's actions had constituted no threat to national security.Obituary of Sir James Dunnett, The Times 6 January 1998 At her trial for the theft of Dunnet's credit cards, de Lambray invented a persona named Caroline Clark. Clark claimed to major newspapers that she was an acquaintance of de Lambray's would sell Fleet Street newspapers the inside story about an upcoming trial involving a former spy chief. This ruse was extremely profitable for de Lambray, who was splashed over the front pages of newspapers - as was Sir James Dunnet. The stories became more and more outrageous, with sex stories that would have been highly embarrassing for Dunnet. Gay News carried a short article in September 1983, saying de Lambray was a convicted High Society art thief and apparent MI5 tempter/temptress, and noting her brief sexual relationship with Captain Anatoli Zotov, former Soviet Naval attache.Gay News 29 September 1983 De Lambray's 900-page autobiographical manuscript - \\"naming names\\" - went missing in the same year.The Guardian 28 July 1983 In May 1986, detectives investigating a series of homosexual murders found de Lambray's name listed in a suspect's address book. In July 1992, The Evening Standard reported that de Lambray was a friend of Private Eye journalist Paul Halloran.The Evening Standard 28 March 1995 She was also a friend of British pop group manager and entrepreneur Kit Lambert. It remains unclear whether de Lambray was, as claimed by some, a transsexual: \\"sometimes called TS but nobody knows for sure, nor will they now.\\" Death Despite a colourful life, de Lambray is perhaps known for a dramatic and mysterious death. According to The Times, de Lambray died in her flat in Stockwell, south London in August 1986 following a suspected heroin overdose. Three hours before she was found, de Lambray telephoned the Press Association, telling a reporter, 'I have just been killed. I have been injected with a huge amount of heroin. I am desperate.'The Times 10 August 1986 De Lambray's initial call to police, asserting that a group of men had injected the heroin into her, may not have been taken seriously. However, when they arrived Vicky was dead. No puncture marks were found on autopsy and no cause of death could be established, though traces of drugs and alcohol were detected in her system. The Guardian 8 November 1986 She is buried at the family churchyard in Herefordshire.

The type gained the name \\"Elephant\\" from its relatively large size and lack of manoeuvrability. The G.102 differed from the G.100 only in having a more powerful engine. Design and development An unusually large aircraft by contemporary standards for a single-seater, the Elephant two-bay equal span staggered biplane was designed by A A Fletcher of the Martinsyde Company, a prototype powered by a 120 hp Austro-Daimler engine entering test in the autumn of 1915. The initial production version, the G.100, was powered by a 120h p six-cylinder Beardmore engine and was armed with a single 0.303 in drum-fed Lewis Gun mounted above the centre section. This was later augmented by a similar weapon bracket-mounted to the port fuselage side behind the cockpit). The G.100 was gradually succeeded by the G.102 with a 160 hp Beardmore engine. Maximum speed of the 160 hp aircraft was at sea level, falling to 100 mph (160 km/h) at 10,000 ft; it had a maximum ceiling of . Operational use The G.100 was built originally as a long-range, single- seat fighter and escort machine but on the basis of its size and weight was reclassified as a day bomber. Deliveries to the RFC commenced in mid-1916, a total of 270 being manufactured. The G.100 and G.102 Elephants were used in France and the Middle East, although only No. 27 Squadron, RFC was completely equipped with this type. While not particularly successful as a fighter owing to its poor agility by comparison other fighters of the times, the Elephant performed a useful service in long-range bombing, carrying up to a 260 lb (120 kg) bomb load. It successfully performed this role from the summer of 1916 through to late 1917. It was also used for long-range photo reconnaissance, where stability and endurance were required (the type was capable of a five- and-a-half-hour flight).

It takes its name from the settlement of Lapal. History The narrow brick-lined tunnel, built in 1798 by William Underhill, had no towpath. It had a very small bore ‚Äî at 7 feet 9 inches, barely wider than the boats which used it, with a headroom of only 6 feet. Boats originally took about three hours to complete the passage by legging or poling, so in 1841 a steam engine was built at the Halesowen end which drove a scoop wheel to load the tunnel with water. Stop gates could be opened at either end to assist boats along the tunnel in either direction. The tunnel suffered many collapses, and after a collapse in 1917 due to mining subsidence it was abandoned. It runs under Lapal, the M5 motorway near junction 3 and Woodgate Valley Country Park. The canal between Halesowen and Selly Oak is also disused and some sections have been filled in as the tunnel was considered uneconomic to repair. A short un-navigable length remains in the grounds the Leasowes, once a garden belonging to the poet William Shenstone (1714‚Äì1763), and now a public park and golf course. To the north of Halesowen, the canal is in good repair and is used by boats accessing Hawne Basin. The canal north of Halesowen includes the Gosty Hill Tunnel which at is much shorter than the Lapal was, but it was built at the same time as the Lapal and has similar dimensions.; Restoration The Lapal Canal Trust is concerned with restoring the lost canal to make it navigable up to the tunnel from both the Halesowen and Selly Oak ends, and originally had a longer term aim of restoring the tunnel. In May 2007 the trust received recommendations from professional consultants, Atkins, that the tunnel should not be restored, but instead be replaced by a new up-and-over alignment using locks.Feasibility Study for the Restoration of the Dudley No.2 Canal (The Lapal Canal) In February 2012 plans for the regeneration of the Selly Oak area were submitted to Birmingham City Council which included a navigable section of canal from a new junction with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal to the recently reconstructed Harborne Lane bridge.

He was also a chief of Senya Breku. Early life Ekow Arkaah was born on 14 July 1927 at Senya Breku in the Central Region of the Gold Coast (now Ghana). He attended Mfantsipim School between 1941 and 1946, then Achimota School. He proceeded to the United States of America, where he obtained his first degree at Tufts College, after which he attended Harvard University for an MBA between 1952 and 1954. Career Arkaah was an Assistant Sales Manager of Secony Oil Corporation of New York City. He later returned to his homeland. From 1954 to 1957, Arkaah worked as a Marketing Executive of Mobil Oil Ghana Limited. For the next 10 years up to 1968, Arkaah worked with the civil service, rising to become Principal Secretary between 1966 and 1968. He was head of the Ghana National Trading Corporation (GNTC), a huge national trading franchise at the time, the Ghana Airways airline and the Ghana National Procurement Agency. During 1965, he was the Chief Commercial Officer for foreign trade. He has also worked as a consultant in the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Yugoslavia and Ethiopia. Politics Arkaah became the leader of the National Convention Party (NCP) prior to the 1992 presidential elections. His party formed an alliance with the National Democratic Congress (NDC) of Jerry Rawlings, and Every Ghanaian Living Everywhere (EGLE). As part of the deal, Arkaah became the Vice-Presidential candidate on Rawlings' ticket. Rawlings and Arkaah had a difficult working relationship throughout their four-year term. The high point was an alleged punch-up between them at a cabinet meeting on 28 December 1995. Rawlings alluded that there had been some form of misunderstanding. Arkaah styled himself the \\"stubborn cat\\" after that incident. Arkaah became the leader of the Convention People's Party formed by the merger of the NCP and the People's Convention Party. The merger was announced on 29 January 1996. Arkaah, who continued as Vice-President of Ghana, stood as a candidate in the 1996 presidential elections and lost. He was replaced in the Rawlings government by Professor John Atta Mills, a law lecturer, as Rawlings' deputy. Death Arkaah was involved in a road traffic accident at Cantonments, Accra.

The film is a remake of a 1959 film, which was also based on the 1957 novel by Nevil Shute, but updates the setting of the story to the film's then- future of 2006, starting with placing the crew on the fictional , USS Charleston (SSN-704). Plot USS Charleston (SSN-704) is equipped with a caterpillar drive and is on station following a nuclear exchange, under the command of Dwight Towers. A devastating nuclear war that contaminated the northern hemisphere was preceded by a standoff between the United States and China after the latter blockaded and later invaded Taiwan. Both countries are destroyed, as is most of the world. The submarine crew finds refuge in Melbourne, Australia which the radioactive fallout has not yet reached (though radio communications with several radio operators farther north than Australia indicate that radiation has reached their countries and will be in Australia in a few months). Towers places his vessel under the command of the Royal Australian Navy and is summoned to attend a briefing, partly regarding an automated digital broadcast coming from Alaska in the Northern Hemisphere. The submarine is sent to investigate, with Towers (Armand Assante), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown), and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes (Grant Bowler) on board. En route, the submarine surfaces in San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins. A crew member who is from San Francisco abandons ship, planning on dying in his home city, and is left by his shipmates after it is argued that the length of time he has spent outside has already made him irreversibly sick with radiation poisoning. Upon reaching Alaska, Towers and his executive officer go ashore to find no survivors. Entering a house and seeing a dead family huddled on a bed, Towers thinks of his own family and what they must have endured. The source of the automated digital broadcast is traced to a television station whose broadcast, Towers and his executive officer discover, comes from a solar-powered laptop trying to broadcast a documentary via satellite. While in Alaska, Towers' executive officer accidentally rips his suit and hides the fact that he is becoming sicker and sicker. Upon the Charleston's return to Melbourne, he collapses and is diagnosed with terminal radiation sickness. Towers attends his old friend in his dying days and ultimately, at his request, euthanizes the man as his deteriorating condition causes him to experience extreme suffering. Towers returns to Melbourne, where a woman in whom he's become interested, Moira Davidson (Rachel Ward), Holmes's sister-in-law and Osborne's ex-wife, is waiting for him. As the people of Melbourne realize that the inevitable nuclear cloud will soon reach their location, their impending doom begins to unravel the social fabric; anarchy and chaos erupt. Some choose to live their final weeks recklessly in a deadly car race while others seek a more peaceful means to face the end of their lives. Holmes and his wife Mary (Jacqueline McKenzie) find solace in their love for each other as Towers and Moira become closer. When radiation sickness appears in Melbourne, people begin lining up for government-issued suicide pills. After Mary and their small daughter Jenny fall ill, Peter and his family share a final moment before taking their doses together, Peter sorrowfully injecting his child. Osborne races around the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit and finally crashes his car at Turn 10, resulting in a fiery death. With most of the Charleston's crew members developing advanced radiation sickness, they ask to take the submarine on one final voyage to San Francisco. Though they know they are unlikely to survive the trip, they wish to die together on the Charleston, the only real home they have left. Towers agrees, apparently abandoning Moira to be with his men. As Moira, about to take her own suicide pill, watches the Charleston sail away, she is joined by Towers after all.

Alterations from the book and original film adaptation are made, including an ending differing from both the novel and film in that the submarine commander chooses to die with his newfound love instead of scuttling the submarine beyond Australian territorial waters (as in the novel) or attempting to return with his crew to the United States (as in the earlier film). In this version, the Golden Gate Bridge has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins, indicating an adjacent nuclear detonation, as in the book but not the first film version. The film ends with the reunion of Towers and Moira while their implied suicides occurring offscreen, as did the original version of Moira in the first film.

Richard Scheib, the Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review critic, saw the film as benefiting from the lengthier timeline: \\"The mini-series certainly has the luxury to pad the story out and tell it with more length than the film did. As a result there is a greater degree of emotional resonance to the characters than the 1959 film had ... Mostly the mini-series works satisfyingly as a romantic drama, which it does reasonably depending on the extent to which one enjoys these things. Crucially though the mini-series does manage to work as science-fiction and Russell Mulcahy delivers some impressive images of the aftermath of the nuclear holocaust.

He and his family were recusants ‚Äî people who adhered to the Roman Catholic faith after the English Reformation. Nevertheless Lord Petre was appointed to a number of official positions in the county of Essex. Biography The Petre family seat at Ingatestone Hall, Essex Gheeraerts' portrait of John's son, William Petre, now thought to be mislabelled as John Petre John was the only surviving son of the statesman Sir William Petre by his second wife Anne Browne, daughter of Sir William Browne, Lord Mayor of London. He lived at Ingatestone Hall in Essex. A talented amateur musician, he kept a full set of musical instruments (lute, five viols, virginals and organ) and was a patron of the composer William Byrd, a fellow Roman Catholic who lived at nearby Stondon Massey. On several occasions, Byrd brought a group of musicians to Ingatestone to entertain at Christmas and dedicated a collection of his Graduale settings to Lord Petre. John Petre was not endowed with the ability of his father and a much less forceful character but being a diligent landowner, public figure and a competent musician along with his great possessions and his father's fame served him well. We know little more about him. Like his descendants, he was a Roman Catholic, but he must have kept his religious opinions in the background, or James would hardly have made him a peer. In 1570, he married Mary (died 2 August 1604), eldest daughter of Sir Edward ‚ÄòWalgrave‚Äô (or Waldegrave) of Borley. By the time of her marriage, Mary was fatherless and poor but gave her parents-in-law ‚Äòmuch joy in his choice‚Äô. She left four sons, of whom the eldest, William (1573-1637), 2nd Lord Petre, was father of William Petre (1602‚Äì1677). He probably erected the beautiful recumbent tomb of Sir William, and is himself commemorated by the magnificent one in the north chapel, now the vestry. When Sir William died in 1572, his widow continued to reside at Ingatestone Hall, and so John and his wife Mary Waldegrave, then resident at Writtle Park, looked for another property to suit their status. In 1574, John added West Thorndon Hall and a further to the family estate, which became the principal seat of the family. He was knighted, in 1576, by Queen Elizabeth I after his father's death. The domestic papers of Queen Elizabeth's time not infrequently notice Sir John. Despite his Catholic attitudes, he held a number of local offices in Essex, as JP, sheriff (1575-6), and deputy lieutenant (1590‚Äì98). He was also MP for Essex in the Parliaments of 1584‚Äì5 and 1586-7. In 1603 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Petre, of Writtle in the County of Essex. He publicly acknowledged that he was a Roman Catholic and his descendants have remained loyal to Catholicism ever since. In 1589 his father's friend, William Cecil, now Lord Burghley, wrote to the Deputy Lieutenants of Essex that he has appointed three gentlemen to be captains of the ‚Äò600 foot formerly entrusted to Sir J. Petre‚Äô. The year 1590 found these foot soldiers trained and in readiness, but the Deputy Lieutenants reported to Lord Burghley that the horses were not ready; they had provided sufficient powder, and assured him that the observances of Lent had in all things been confirmed. This was just after the Spanish Armada, and the county still lived in fear of invasion. The same year found John Petre joined with Sir Thomas Mildmay investigating the grievance of the mariners, gunners, fishermen, and other seafaring men within the county, who complained they were kept from their ordinary occupation by being constrained to attend at three hours‚Äô warning for Navy service. In 1600, Sir John installed his newly married son in Ingatestone Hall, to gain experience in the ‚Äògovernment‚Äô of a house, and the in-going inventory gives a vivid picture of it within a generation of the builder's death. On his accession to the English throne, King James I found himself short of money, and, his predecessors having disposed of all the Abbey and Church lands, he ingeniously started selling peerages. Eight years later James created baronetcies, and sold them instead of the peerages. By 1615, James was selling peerages at ¬£100,000 each, just over ¬£11 million today). John Petre's vast properties and position in the county would have justified James I elevating him to the peerage which he was in the accession honours on 21 July 1603 and thus created Baron Petre of Writtle. But we can be reasonably sure that John's ennoblement was for more honourable reasons, as J.P., High Sheriff, Deputy Lieutenant, Knight of the Shire and militia commander, he was a loyal servant of the Crown. He died at West Horndon, Essex on 11 October 1613, and was buried in St Edmund and St Mary's Church, Ingatestone, leaving three sons and one daughter. He augmented his father's benefactions to Exeter College, contributed ¬£951 to the Virginia Company, and became a Roman Catholic. Exeter College published in his honour a thin quarto entitled ‚ÄòThreni Exoniensium in obitum ‚Ä¶ D. Johannis Petrei, Baronis de Writtle‚Äô, Oxford, 1613. He was succeeded in the barony by his son William. Memorials A pair of paintings among the Petre Pictures dating from 1590, attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts, were once thought to be the portraits of John and Mary. The paintings were restored after the fire at Thorndon Hall in 1876 and brought to Ingatestone Hall, and bear painted inscriptions naming the subjects. Art historian Roy Strong contends that these are in fact portraits of John's son and daughter-in-law, William Petre and Katherine, daughter of the Earl of Worcester. The portraits are colourful and relaxed, showing fashionable changes in costume. Lord Petre wears a white ruff over a lace collar, embroidered doublet, the full breeches, bobbed hair, moustache and slight beard and, in the fashion of the time, the minute patch of hair below the bottom lip. His wife is equally in fashion; the cartwheel-topped skirt, the full upper sleeves and a variation of ruff open in front to show the neck, a delicate silver tiara and the splendid necklace of pearls, 1466 in all. The stone tomb of Lord Petre and Mary is situated in the Ingatestone Church.  Notes   References  *Edwards, A. C., John Petre: Essays on the life and background of John, 1st Lord Petre, 1549-1613.

Seung-Hui Cho, an undergraduate student at the university and a U.S. resident of South Korean origin, shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others with two semi-automatic pistols. Six others were injured jumping out of windows to escape Cho. As police stormed Norris Hall, Cho committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. It is the deadliest school shooting in the history of the United States, and was also the deadliest mass shooting by a lone gunman in U.S. history until it was surpassed nine years later by the Orlando nightclub shooting. The attacks received international media coverage and provoked widespread criticism of U.S. gun culture. It sparked intense debate about gun violence, gun laws, gaps in the U.S. system for treating mental health issues, the perpetrator's state of mind, the responsibility of college administrations, privacy laws, journalism ethics, and other issues. Television news organizations that aired portions of the killer's multimedia manifesto were criticized by victims' families, Virginia law enforcement officials, and the American Psychiatric Association. Cho had previously been diagnosed with selective mutism and severe depression. During much of his middle school and high school years, he received therapy and special education support. After graduating from high school, Cho enrolled at Virginia Tech. Because of federal privacy laws, Virginia Tech was unaware of Cho's previous diagnosis or the accommodations he had been granted at school. In 2005, Cho was accused of stalking two female students. After an investigation, a Virginia special justice declared Cho mentally ill and ordered him to attend treatment; however, because he was not institutionalized, he was still allowed to purchase guns. The shooting prompted the state of Virginia to close legal loopholes that had previously allowed individuals adjudicated as mentally unsound to purchase handguns without detection by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). It also led to passage of the only major federal gun control measure in the U.S. since 1994. The law strengthening the NICS was signed by President George W. Bush on January 5, 2008. The Virginia Tech Review Panel is a state- appointed body that was assigned to review the incident. The panel criticized Virginia Tech administrators for failing to take action that might have reduced the number of casualties. The panel's report also reviewed gun laws and pointed out gaps in mental health care as well as privacy laws that left Cho's deteriorating condition untreated when he was a student at Virginia Tech.  Attacks  Harper Hall (Cho's dorm), Norris Hall, West Ambler Johnston Hall, and the Blacksburg, Virginia, U.S. Post Office The shootings occurred in two separate incidents. The first incident was in West Ambler Johnston Hall, a residence hall where Seung-Hui Cho killed two students. The second incident was in Norris Hall, an academic building on the opposite side of the campus where the other 31 deaths, including that of Cho himself, and all the nonlethal injuries, occurred. Cho used two pistols during the attacks: a .22-caliber Walther P22 semi-automatic handgun and a 9 mm semi-automatic Glock 19 handgun. = West Ambler Johnston shootings = Cho was seen near the entrance to West Ambler Johnston Hall, a co-ed residence hall that houses 895 students, at about 6:47 a.m. EDT. Normally, the hall is accessible only to its residents via magnetic key cards before 10:00 a.m.; Cho's student mailbox was in the lobby of the building, so he had a pass card allowing access after 7:30 a.m., but it is unclear how he gained earlier entrance to the building. At around 7:15 a.m., Cho entered the room that freshman Emily J. Hilscher shared with another student, and shot Hilscher, a 19-year-old from Woodville, Virginia, who was fatally wounded. After hearing the gunshots, a resident assistant, Ryan C. Clark, attempted to aid Hilscher. Cho shot and killed Clark, a 22-year-old senior from Martinez, Georgia. Hilscher remained alive for three hours after being shot, but no one from the school, law enforcement, or hospital notified her family until after she had died. Cho left the scene and returned to his room in Harper Hall, a dormitory west of West Ambler Johnston Hall. While police and emergency medical services units were responding to the shootings in the dorm next door, Cho changed out of his bloodstained clothes, logged on to his computer to delete his e-mails, and then removed the hard drive. About an hour after the attack, Cho is believed to have been seen near the campus duck pond. Although authorities suspected Cho had thrown his hard drive and mobile phone into the water, a search by divers was unsuccessful. Almost two hours after the first killings, Cho appeared at a nearby post office and mailed a package of writings and video recordings in which Cho said \\"you made me do it\\", likened himself to Jesus Christ on the cross and ranted about \\"debauchery\\", \\"hedonism\\", \\"brats\\" and \\"snobs\\" to NBC News; these proved to be of little investigative value to authorities. The package was postmarked 9:01 a.m. = Norris Hall shootings = Elementary French class students take cover in Holden Hall room 212. About two hours after the initial shootings, Cho entered Norris Hall, which housed the Engineering Science and Mechanics program among others. In a backpack, he carried several chains, locks, a hammer, a knife, two handguns with nineteen 10- and 15-round magazines, and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition. With the locks and chains, he chained the three main entrance doors shut. He placed a note on one of the chained doors, claiming that attempting to open the door would cause a bomb to explode. Shortly before the shooting began, a faculty member found the note and took it to the third floor to notify the school's administration. At about the same time, Cho had begun to shoot students and faculty on the second floor. The bomb threat was never called in. The first call to 9-1-1 was received at 9:42 a.m. According to several students, Cho looked into several classrooms before the shooting began. Erin Sheehan, an eyewitness and survivor who had been in Room 207, told reporters that the shooter \\"peeked in twice\\" earlier in the lesson and that \\"it was strange that someone at this point in the semester would be lost, looking for a class\\". At about 9:40 a.m., Cho began shooting. His first attack after entering Norris occurred in an advanced hydrology engineering class taught by Professor G. V. Loganathan (from India) in Room 206. Cho first shot and killed the professor, then continued firing, killing nine of the thirteen students in the room and injuring two others in the classroom. He also shot at one male student, but missed him Next, Cho went across the hall and into Room 207, where instructor Jamie Bishop was teaching Introductory German. Cho shot at a student, then Bishop, and the rest of the students, killing Bishop and four students; six other students were wounded. Cho then moved on to Norris 211 and 204. In both of these classrooms, Cho was initially prevented from entering due to barricades erected by instructors and students. In Room 204, Professor Liviu Librescu, a Holocaust survivor from Romania, forcibly prevented Cho from entering the room. Librescu was able to hold the door closed with his body until most of his students escaped through the windows; he died after being shot through the door. One graduate student, named Minal Panchal, was one of the 23 registered students who died in his classroom. Two others who were lying in a corner were injured, but survived. In Room 211 of Intermediate French, Instructor Jocelyne Couture-Nowak and student Henry Lee were killed as they attempted to barricade the door. When Cho broke through the barricade and entered the room, a student named Matthew LaPorte, who was a trained Air Force ROTC Cadet, charged towards the gunman, but died after taking heavy fire in an attempt to save lives. (LaPorte was posthumously awarded the Airman's Medal for his actions in 2015, which was accepted by his family at his gravesite in Blacksburg.) According to the Virginia Tech Review Panel's report, eleven of the sixteen students died in Room 211 and the six students who survived, all who suffered gunshot wounds, including Kristina Anderson and Colin Goddard, who are both spokespeople and activists for less gun violence. One survivor, Clay Violand, stated that he played dead and escaped without injury. Hearing the commotion from below, Professor Kevin Granata took twenty students from a classroom on the third floor into his office where the door could be locked. He then went downstairs to investigate along with another professor named Wally Grant until they both were shot by Cho on the stairwell. Professor Wally was wounded and survived, but Granata died of his injuries. None of the students locked in Granata's office were hurt or killed. Cho reloaded and re- entered several of the classrooms. After Cho's first entry to Room 207, several students had barricaded the door and had begun tending to the wounded. When Cho returned minutes later, Katelyn Carney and spokesperson Derek O'Dell were injured while holding the door closed. Cho also returned to Room 206 (Professors Loganathan's room), Loganathan's room. According to a student eyewitness, the movements of a wounded named Waleed Shaalan, who was already wounded, distracted Cho from a nearby student after the shooter had returned to the room. Shaalan was shot a second time and died. Also in Room 206, another student named Partahi Lumbantoruan may have shielded fellow student Guillermo Colman from more serious injury after being shot. (It was then stated that Colman pulled Lumbantouran's body over himself.) Colman's various accounts make it unclear whether this act was intentional or the involuntary result of Lumbantoruan being shot a second time. In Room 205, students barricaded the door with a large table after graduate assistant Haiyan Cheng (), who was substituting for the professor, and a student saw Cho heading toward them. Cho shot through the door several times, but failed to force his way in. No one in the classroom was wounded or killed. Approximately eleven minutes after the second attack began, police started to enter the building nine and a half minutes later. They broke down chain locked door and went up to the third floor, but heard from a girl named Emily Haas, who was wounded and survived in Room 211 (Professor Nowak's French class), that the gunman was in her classroom. As police started to descended on the stairwell floor, Cho shot himself in the temple with the Glock 19 and died instantly just as police reached the second floor. When police arrived at Room 211, they saw Cho lying on ground right in the doorway, in which some students, who were either injured or playing dead, heard the officer's first words: \\"Gunman down!\\" During the investigation, State Police Superintendent William Flaherty told a state panel that police found 203 remaining rounds of ammunition in Norris Hall. \\"He was well prepared to continue on,\\" Flaherty testified. During the two attacks, Cho killed five faculty members and twenty-seven students (two students in West Ambler Johnston and 30 at Norris Hall (five professors and 25 students) ) before he committed suicide. The Virginia Tech Review Panel reported that Cho's gunshots wounded seventeen other people; six more were injured when they jumped from second-story windows to escape from Professor Librescu‚Äôs classroom. Sydney J. Vail, the director of the trauma center at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, said that Cho's choice of 9 mm hollow- point ammunition increased the severity of the injuries. 28 of the victims were shot in the head.Crews, Gordon A.: Handbook of Research on Mass Shootings and Multiple Victim Violence, p. 295. .  Perpetrator  The shooter was identified as 23-year-old Seung-Hui Cho, a senior at Virginia Tech. He was a South Korean citizen with U.S. permanent resident status who was majoring in English. The Virginia Tech Review Panel's August 2007 report (Massengill Report) devoted more than 20 pages to Cho's troubled history. At three years of age, Cho was described as shy, frail, and wary of physical contact. In eighth grade, Cho was diagnosed with severe depression as well as selective mutism, an anxiety disorder that inhibited him from speaking in certain situations and/or to specific people. While early media reports carried reports by South Korean relatives that Cho had autism, the Massengill Report stated that the relationship between selective mutism and autism was \\"unclear\\". Cho's family sought therapy for him, and he received help periodically throughout middle school and high school. Early reports indicated Cho was bullied for speech difficulties in middle school, but the Virginia Tech Review Panel was unable to confirm this, or other reports that he was ostracized and mercilessly bullied for class-, height-, and race-related reasons in high school, causing some anti-bullying advocates to feel that the Review Panel was engaging in an authority-absolving whitewash. Supposedly, high school officials had worked with his parents and mental health counselors to support Cho throughout his sophomore and junior years. Cho eventually chose to discontinue therapy. When he applied and was admitted to Virginia Tech, school officials did not report his speech and anxiety-related problems or special education status because of federal privacy laws that prohibit such disclosure unless a student requests special accommodation. The Massengill Report detailed numerous incidents of aberrant behavior beginning in Cho's junior year of college that illustrated his deteriorating mental condition. Several former professors of Cho reported that his writing as well as his classroom behavior was disturbing, and he was encouraged to seek counseling. He was also investigated by the university for stalking and harassing two female students. In 2005, Cho had been declared mentally ill by a Virginia special justice and ordered to seek outpatient treatment. The Virginia Tech Review Panel Report cited misinterpretations of federal privacy laws when it faulted university officials for failing to share information that would have shed light on the seriousness of Cho's problems. The report pointed to failures by Virginia Tech's counseling center, flaws in Virginia's mental health laws, and inadequate state mental health services, but concluded that \\"Cho himself was the biggest impediment to stabilizing his mental health\\" in college. The report also stated that the classification detail that Cho was to seek \\"outpatient\\" rather than \\"inpatient\\" treatment would generally have been legally interpreted at the time as not requiring that Cho be reported to Virginia's Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) and entered into the CCRE database of people prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Cho's underlying psychological diagnosis at the time of the shootings remains a matter of speculation. One professor tried to get him to seek counseling, but Cho chose not to. Early reports suggested that the killings resulted from a romantic dispute between Cho and Emily Hilscher, one of his first two victims. However, Hilscher's friends said she had no prior relationship with Cho and there is no evidence that he ever met or talked with her before the murders. In the ensuing investigation, police found a suicide note in Cho's dorm room that included comments about \\"rich kids\\", \\"debauchery\\", and \\"deceitful charlatans\\". On April 18, 2007, NBC News received a package from Cho time- stamped between the first and second shooting episodes. It contained an 1,800-word manifesto, photos, and 27 digitally-recorded videos in which Cho likened himself to Jesus Christ and expressed his hatred of the wealthy. He stated, among other things, \\"You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. ... You just loved to crucify me. You loved inducing cancer in my head, terror in my heart and ripping my soul all this time\\". Media organizations, including Newsweek, MSNBC, Reuters, and the Associated Press, raised questions about and speculated on the similarity between a stance in one of Cho's videos that showed him holding and raising a hammer, and a pose from promotional posters for the South Korean movie Oldboy. Investigators found no evidence that Cho had ever watched Oldboy, and the professor who made the initial connection to Oldboy has since discounted his theory that Cho was influenced by the movie. The Virginia Tech Review Panel concluded that because of Cho's inability to handle stress and the \\"frightening prospect\\" of being \\"turned out into the world of work, finances, responsibilities, and a family,\\" Cho chose to engage in a fantasy in which \\"he would be remembered as the savior of the oppressed, the downtrodden, the poor, and the rejected.\\" The panel went further, stating that, \\"His thought processes were so distorted that he began arguing to himself that his evil plan was actually doing good. His destructive fantasy was now becoming an obsession.\\"  Responses to the incidents  = Emergency services response = Police arrived within three minutes after receiving the emergency call but took about five minutes to enter the barricaded building. When they could not break the chains, an officer shot out a deadbolt lock leading into a laboratory; they then moved to a nearby stairwell. As police reached the second floor, they heard Cho fire his final shot; Cho's body was discovered in Room 211, which was Jocelyne Couture-Nowak's classroom. In the aftermath, high winds related to the April 2007 nor'easter prevented emergency medical services from using helicopters for evacuation of the injured. Victims injured in the shooting were treated at Montgomery Regional Hospital in Blacksburg, Carilion New River Valley Medical Center in Radford, Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital in Roanoke, Holston Valley Hospital in Kingsport, Tennessee, and Lewis-Gale Medical Center in Salem. = University response = Hokies released 32 balloons before their 2007 football opener as part of a ceremony in the victims' memory. The university first informed students via e-mail at 9:26 a.m. This was about two hours after the first shooting, which was thought at the time to be isolated and domestic in nature. After the full extent of the shooting became evident, Virginia Tech canceled classes for the rest of the week and held an assembly and candlelight vigil the day after the shooting on April 17. Norris Hall was closed for the remainder of the semester. The university offered counseling for students and faculty, and the American Red Cross dispatched several dozen crisis counselors to Blacksburg to help students. University officials also allowed students, if they chose, to abbreviate their semester coursework and still receive a grade. The day following the shooting, a memorial event was held at Cassell Coliseum. The event included a speech by then-President George W. Bush. The space reached capacity and overflow seating was accommodated at nearby Lane Stadium. Within a day after the shootings, Virginia Tech, whose supporters call themselves \\"Hokies\\", a nickname coined in a school cheer dating to 1896, formed the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund (HSMF) to help remember and honor the victims. The fund was used to cover expenses including, but not limited to: assistance to victims and their families, grief counseling, memorials, communications expenses, and comfort expenses. Early in June 2007, the Virginia Tech Foundation announced that $3.2 million was moved from the HSMF into 32 separately-named endowment funds, each created in honor of a victim killed in the shooting. This transfer brought each fund to the level of full endowment, allowing them to operate in perpetuity. The naming and determination of how each fund would be directed was being developed with the victims' families. By early June 2007, donations to the HSMF had reached approximately $7 million. In July 2007, Kenneth R. Feinberg, who served as Special Master of the federal September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001, was named to administer the fund's distributions. In October 2007, the families and surviving victims received payments from the fund ranging from $11,500 to $208,000 . Early in June 2007, the university announced that it would begin to reoccupy Norris Hall within a matter of weeks. The building is used for offices and laboratories for the Engineering Science and Mechanics and Civil and Environmental Engineering departments, its primary occupants before the shootings. Plans were to completely renovate the building and for it to no longer contain classrooms. The southwest wing of Norris Hall, where the shootings took place, was closed in 2008 and completely renovated in 2008 and 2009. The building now houses the Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention, the Biomechanics Cluster Research Center, and the Global Technology Center, as well as other programs. Ambler Johnston Hall was also closed and renovated. The east wing now houses the Honors Residential College, which opened in fall 2011; in fall 2012, the west wing reopened as the Residential College at West Ambler Johnston. After the release of the Massengill Report, some parents of those killed called for Virginia's governor to relieve the university president, Charles Steger, and campus police chief, Wendell Flinchum, of their positions. However, Governor Tim Kaine refused to do so, saying that the school officials had \\"suffered enough\\". The Virginia Tech community mourns the victims at a candlelight vigil. = Campus response = In the hours and days following the shooting, makeshift memorials to those killed or injured began appearing in several locations on the campus. Many people placed flowers and items of remembrance at the base of the Drillfield observation podium in front of Burruss Hall. Later, members of Hokies United, an alliance of student organizations on campus created to respond to tragedies placed 32 pieces of Hokie Stone, each labeled with the name of a victim, in a semicircle in front of the Drillfield viewing stand. What was originally termed an \\"intermediate memorial\\" was modeled after the makeshift memorial. Thirty-two upright blocks of Hokie Stone were engraved with the names of the victims and placed in a semicircle at the base of the reviewing stand. The original pieces of Hokie Stone placed by Hokies United were offered to the families of the victims. The engraved markers are embedded in a semicircle of crushed gravel with a brick walkway for viewing. There is ground lighting for nighttime illumination and two benches, one on either side of the memorial, in honor of the survivors. Permanent memorial on Virginia Tech's Drillfield Tech students of South Korean descent initially feared they would be targeted for retribution. While no official claims of harassment were made, anecdotal evidence suggests that some Korean students were affected. The shootings occurred as prospective students were deciding whether to accept offers of admission from colleges and universities. Despite this timing, Virginia Tech exceeded its recruiting goal of 5,000 students for the class of 2011. =Global Support and Outreach= In the days following the shooting, the campus community received several thousand of pieces of artifacts and messages of condolence, arriving from over 80 countries and every state within the United States. These included artwork, cards, poetry, original music. These items were later gathered and photographed by the University Library and are available online to share with the world: Condolence Archives of the University Libraries. = Government response = President George W. Bush and his wife Laura attended the convocation at Virginia Tech the day after the shootings. The Internal Revenue Service and Virginia Department of Taxation granted six-month extensions to individuals affected by the shootings. Virginia Governor Tim Kaine returned early from a trade mission to Tokyo, Japan, and declared a state of emergency in Virginia, enabling him to immediately deploy state personnel, equipment, and other resources in the aftermath of the shootings. President George W. Bush comforts Virginia Tech Student Government Association President James Tyger after giving his speech at the school's convocation. Laura Bush looks on. Governor Kaine later created an eight-member panel, including former United States Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, to review all aspects of the Virginia Tech shooting, from Cho's medical history to the school's delay in warning students of danger and locking down the campus after the bodies of Cho's first two victims were discovered. In August 2007, the panel concluded, among more than twenty major findings, that the Virginia Tech Police Department \\"did not take sufficient action to deal with what might happen if the initial lead proved erroneous\\". The panel made more than seventy preventive recommendations, directed to colleges, universities, mental health providers, law enforcement officials, emergency service providers, law makers and other public officials in Virginia and elsewhere. While the panel did find errors in judgment and procedure, the ultimate conclusion was that Cho himself was responsible for his own actions, and to imply that anyone else was accountable \\"would be wrong\\". The Review Panel validated public criticisms that Virginia Tech police erred in \\"prematurely concluding that their initial lead in the double homicide was a good one,\\" and in delaying a campus-wide notification for almost two hours. The report analyzed the feasibility of a campus lockdown and essentially agreed with police testimony that such an action was not feasible. The report concluded that the toll could have been reduced if the university had made an immediate decision to cancel classes and a stronger, clearer initial alert of the presence of a gunman. The incident caused Virginia Commonwealth elected officials to re-examine gaps between federal and state gun purchase laws. Within two weeks, Governor Kaine had issued an executive order designed to close those gaps (see Effects on gun politics below). Prompted by the incident, the federal government passed the first gun control law in more than a decade. The bill, , mandates improvements in state reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) in order to halt gun purchases by criminals, those declared mentally ill, and other people prohibited from possessing firearms, and authorizes up to $1.3 billion in federal grants for such improvements. Both the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Rifle Association supported the legislation. The measure passed the United States House of Representatives on a voice vote on June 13, 2007. The Senate passed the measure on December 19, 2007. President Bush signed the measure on January 5, 2008. On March 24, 2008, the U.S. Department of Education announced proposed changes in the regulations governing education records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Certain of the changes address issues raised by the Virginia Tech incident and are intended to clarify for schools the appropriate balance to strike between concerns of individual privacy and public safety. = South Korean response = When the citizenship of the shooter became known, South Koreans expressed shock and a sense of public shame, while the government of South Korea convened an emergency meeting to consider possible ramifications. A candlelight vigil was held outside the Embassy of the United States in Seoul. South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun expressed condolences, saying that he hoped that the U.S. would recover quickly from the incident. Although Cho came to the U.S. as a third-grader and was a permanent resident of the U.S., many South Koreans felt guilt and mourned because they considered him a South Korean by \\"blood\\". One South Korean commentator opined that South Korean fears of xenophobic reprisals from Americans against them were from a South Korean- centric perspective not applicable to U.S. culture. South Korea's ambassador to the U.S. and several Korean American religious leaders called on Korean Americans to participate in a 32-day fast, one day for each victim, for repentance. The foreign minister, Song Minsoon, announced that safety measures had been established for South Korean citizens living in the U.S., in an apparent reference to fears of possible reprisal attacks. A ministry official expressed hope that the shooting would not \\"stir up racial prejudice or confrontation\\". Some South Koreans criticized the fasting proposal, saying that it directed undue attention on Cho's ethnicity and not other reasons behind the shooting. News reports noted that South Koreans seemed relieved that American news coverage of Cho primarily focused the blame on his psychological problems rather than his race or ethnicity. The Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) pulled its \\"Sparkling Korea\\" television advertisements, saying it would be inappropriate to air the ads featuring images of South Korea's culture and natural beauty in between the news reports of the rampage. = Academic/industry response = Penn State fans pay tribute to the fallen Hokies at the Nittany Lions spring football game. Hundreds of other colleges and universities throughout North America responded to the incident with official condolences and by conducting their own vigils, memorial services, and by other gestures of support. Virginia Tech's traditional sports rival, the University of Virginia, held a candlelight vigil the night of April 17, at which UVA president John T. Casteen spoke. He urged the crowd of students, which overflowed the campus's McIntire Amphitheatre, to continue to move forward to change the world. Some schools also offered or provided cash donations, housing for officers, and additional counseling support for Virginia Tech. Both inside the U.S. and abroad, the incident caused many universities to re-examine their own campus safety and security procedures as well as their mental health support services. = Other responses = The International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA) convened a Special Review Task Force, which issued its report on April 18, 2008, titled, \\"The IACLEA Blueprint for Safer Campuses\\". The report was \\"a synthesis of the reports written following the tragedy at Virginia Tech and related recommendations for campus safety by the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators\\". It included IACLEA's Key Recommendations, a Summary of 10 Key Findings of Virginia Governor's Review Panel, a listing of Fatal Shootings on U.S. Campuses, and the IACLEA Position Statement on Concealed-Carry Initiatives. The Task Force made twenty specific recommendations, representing \\"the Association's priorities for the betterment of campus safety\\" and reinforcing \\"key goals and objectives in mitigating and responding to threats at institutions of higher learning.\\" The report states, \\"IACLEA does not support the carry and concealment of weapons on a college campus, with the exception of sworn police officers in the conduct of their professional duties\\". The subsequent Position Statement goes into greater detail. Additionally, the report includes an acknowledgement of the \\"professionalism and well coordinated response\\" of all the law enforcement agencies and first responders, and ends its conclusion with \\"Securing the safety of our campuses is an iterative process that requires an institutional and personal commitment from every member of our educational communities. Let these recommendations strengthen that resolve.\\" EQUITAS, a Canada-based \\"Strategic Rule of law Think Tank\\" governed by international law, published a report pertaining to the Virginia Tech shooting which includes a review of measures for counter-terrorism and campus security adopted between 1993 and April 16, 2007. The report criticizes Virginia Tech's institutional decision- making process and summarizes the lethal effects of failing to \\"implement and administer valid procedural and substantive safeguards aimed at securing the broad Va Tech and Blacksburg community against Level II type incidents involving acts of terrorism and mass casualties\\". The report does not comment on gun control or mental health issues. Some of Cho's family members expressed sympathy for the victims' families and described his history of mental and behavioral problems. Cho's maternal grandfather was quoted in the Daily Mirror referring to Cho as a person who deserved to die with the victims. On Friday, April 20, Cho's family issued a statement of grief and apology, written by his sister, Sun-Kyung Cho, a 2004 graduate of Princeton University who was employed as a contractor for a State Department office. In it, she stated: Many heads of state and international figures offered condolences and sympathy, including Pope Benedict XVI, the Presidents of Chile, France, Mexico, Peru, and South Korea, the President-elect of Mauritania, the Prime Ministers of Greece and Japan, and the King of Morocco. Statements of condolence were issued by officials and diplomats from Canada, Georgia, Hungary, Iran, Nicaragua, Russia, Suriname, Thailand, and Venezuela. A State Department spokesman said, \\"We haven't seen this kind of sympathy and support since Hurricane Katrina and 9/11.\\" South Korean UN Secretary-General Ban Ki‚Äëmoon condemned the killings. On May 3, 2007, Queen Elizabeth II addressed the Virginia legislature, extending her sympathy on behalf of the United Kingdom. She then met privately with some faculty and survivors, including three who were wounded. One of the survivors of the shooting, Katelyn Carney, who was shot in the hand, presented the Queen with a bracelet of thirty-two jewels in the Virginia Tech colors‚Äîmaroon and orange. The Queen subsequently visited Jamestown, Virginia, to mark the 400th anniversary of the first permanent English settlement in the United States, which was the primary purpose of her trip. Sporting teams and leagues at both the college and professional levels, as well as sports figures from football, baseball, basketball, hockey, soccer, and NASCAR racing, paid their respects and joined fundraising efforts to honor the victims, most notably the Washington Nationals, who wore Virginia Tech hats in a game, and D.C. United, who wore special Virginia Tech jerseys during a game; NASCAR put Virginia Tech decals on all its cars for three weeks. East Carolina University made a $100,000 donation, raised at the behest of its Athletics Director, Terry Holland. East Carolina was the opponent for Virginia Tech's opening home football game at Lane Stadium on September 1, 2007, with more than 60,000 in attendance. Prior to the kickoff, thirty-two orange balloons were released in memory of the victims. It came to light that Seung-Hui Cho used eBay to purchase two 10-round magazines for one of the guns used in the shootings. On July 30, 2007, the online auctioneer prohibited the sale of firearms magazines, firearms parts, and ammunition on its site. In May 2010, the American band Exodus released an album, titled, Exhibit B: The Human Condition, which included the track \\"Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer)\\". Band member Gary Holt stated, \\"The song was primarily inspired by the massacre at Virginia Tech, as well as Columbine and the many other instances of unhinged individuals who decided to take out their wrath on their classmates, going all the way back to Charles J. Whitman.\\" = Controversial responses = Two students at Pennsylvania State University dressed as Virginia Tech shooting victims for Halloween in 2007, posting their photos on Facebook, which generated outrage at both Penn State and Virginia Tech. Penn State sent a statement to Virginia Tech, stating, \\"We're appalled that these individuals would display this level of insensitivity and lack of common decency by dressing up in this manner. The fact that one of the individuals is actually from Virginia makes it even more difficult to understand.\\" An amateur computer video game that re-creates the shooting, V-Tech Rampage, also sparked outrage. The creator, Ryan Lambourn, a resident of Sydney, Australia, who grew up in the United States, posted a message on his website stating that he would remove the game in exchange for payment, but later posted that the statement was a joke. New York State Senator Andrew Lanza called for a boycott of the game, stating, \\"There are certain things in life you don't make light of and should not be turning into a game. It's not a game, it's a tremendous loss of life.\\" The Australian Minister of Communications, Senator Helen Coonan, said that she would launch an official investigation, stating, \\"The individual responsible for the game is using a terrible tragedy to draw attention to himself and his work. It is in very poor taste and the person concerned may want to consider getting some professional help.\\" Lambourn also created a video game based on the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which drew criticism and sparked outrage. = Continuing response = Bench in honor of the survivors of the shooting. It is slightly south of the main memorial. A Northern Virginia chapter of the B'nai B'rith Youth Organization, founded in November 2008 by Aaron Adler and Ethan Blonder, took on the name Liviu Librescu AZA, in honor of the Holocaust survivor who used his body to barricade Cho from entering his room. On September 4, 2009, the Marching Virginians, one of Virginia Tech's marching bands, took a side trip on their way to the season opening football game against the University of Alabama at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The 350-member band, 20 cheerleaders, and members of the Corps of Cadets color guard performed at Lakeside High School, alma mater of Ryan Clark, along with the Lakeside Marching Band and visiting Evans High's band. The event was organized by the Central Savannah River Area Virginia Tech alumni chapter to honor Clark's memory and as a fundraiser for a scholarship in his name. Following the 2007 shootings, Virginia Tech began employing an alert system on their website and text messages to warn students of danger. The alert system was first activated in 2008 when an exploded cartridge from a nail gun produced sounds similar to gunfire near a campus dormitory. It was again activated on August 4, 2011, when children attending a summer class reported a man carrying a handgun; police were unable to find anyone matching the children's description. Later in 2011, on December 8, the system was activated again after a police officer was shot and killed on campus. This turned out to be a random act by a part-time Radford University student. He had carjacked a Mercedes SUV earlier in the day in nearby Radford and had parked it in the general area of a Virginia Tech parking lot where the victim officer was conducting a routine traffic stop on a third party. The shooter turned the gun on himself a half-hour later.  Anniversary activities  Beginning with the first anniversary of the attack and continuing since, the Queens' Guard of The College of William & Mary, another public university in Virginia, has memorialized the victims with an honor guard at the head of the College's Sunken Garden. The honor guard is modeled after the honor guard posted at the Tomb of the Unknowns by soldiers of the U.S. Army's Old Guard. Several organizations have hosted annual blood drives on or near the anniversary date of the shooting as a tribute to the victims. The Virginia Tech Alumni Association National Capital Region Chapter (the \\"DC Hokies\\") has held a yearly blood drive in remembrance of the victims of the shooting, as well as sponsoring a local \\"3.2 for 32\\" run on or near the anniversary. The Shenandoah Chapter of the Virginia Tech Alumni Association also hosts an annual blood drive. Other blood drives are held by the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets and other chapters of the Virginia Tech Alumni Association, under the name \\"Virginia Tech for life\\". Virginia Tech holds a yearly Day of Remembrance for the attack, with events such as a candle lighting ceremony, a wreath laying, a moment of silence at 9:43 A.M., and a Cadet Guard at the Memorial for 32 minutes.  Criticism of university response  Sociology professor Kenneth Westhues criticized the Virginia Tech response to the shootings and the Massengill Report. Westhues identified the cause of the shootings as the mobbing Cho experienced in the Virginia Tech English department and suggested that the explanation for the Virginia Tech shootings should go beyond what he calls the \\"defective character\\" explanation: Westhues cited the experiences of another Virginia Tech student in the same department as being very similar to Cho's. He criticized Virginia Tech and the Massengill Report for failing to advance a fuller explanation of the causes of the shootings, which he suggested should be one of \\"character-situation interplay\\". Lucinda Roy is the former chair of Virginia Tech's English department. In her book, No Right to Remain Silent: What We've Learned from the Tragedy at Virginia Tech, she was also critical of the way the university treated Cho as a student. Roy worked with him one-on-one in a poetry tutorial and felt he didn't get the help that he needed.  Effects on gun politics  Walther P22, one of the two semi- automatic weapons Cho used in the shooting. The mass shooting reignited the gun politics debate in the United States, with proponents of gun control legislation arguing that guns are too accessible, citing that Cho, a mentally unsound individual, was able to purchase two handguns despite state laws that should have prevented such a purchase. Opponents of gun control argued that Virginia Tech's gun-free \\"safe zone\\" policy ensured that none of the other students or faculty would be armed and that as a result they were unable to stop Cho. = Virginia context = Law enforcement officials found a purchase receipt for one of the guns used in the assault among Cho's belongings. The shooter waited one month after buying a Walther P22 pistol before he bought a second pistol, a Glock 19. Cho used a 15-round magazine in the Glock and a 10-round magazine in the Walther. The serial numbers on the weapons were filed off, but the ATF National Laboratory was able to reveal them and performed a firearms trace. The sale of firearms by licensed dealers in Virginia is restricted to residents who successfully pass a background check; legal permanent resident aliens may purchase firearms. At the time of the shooting, Virginia law also limited purchases of handguns to one every 30 days. That limit was repealed on April 3, 2013. Federal lawBrady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requires a criminal background check for all firearm purchases from licensed firearms dealers, and Virginia checks other databases in addition to the federally mandated NICS. A 1968 federal law passed in response to the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. prohibits those \\"adjudicated as a mental defective\\" from buying guns. This exclusion applied to Cho after a Virginia court declared him to be a danger to himself in late 2005 and sent him for psychiatric treatment. Because of gaps between federal and Virginia state laws, the state did not report Cho's legal status to the NICS. Virginia Governor Timothy Kaine addressed this problem on April 30, 2007, by issuing an executive order intended to close those reporting gaps. In August 2007, the Massengill Report called for a permanent change in the Code of Virginia to clarify and strengthen the state's background check requirements. The federal government later passed a law to improve state reporting to the NICS nationwide. = Campus firearms ban = The shootings also renewed debate surrounding Virginia Tech's firearms ban. The university has a general ban on possession or storage of firearms on campus by employees, students, and volunteers, or any visitor or other third parties, even if they are concealed handgun permit holders. In April 2005, a student permitted by the state to carry concealed handguns was discovered in possession of a concealed firearm while in class. While no criminal charges were filed, a university spokesman said the University had \\"the right to adhere to and enforce that policy as a common-sense protection of students, staff and faculty as well as guests and visitors\\". In January 2006, prior to the shootings, legislator Todd Gilbert had introduced a related bill into the Virginia House of Delegates. The bill, HB 1572, was intended to forbid public universities in Virginia from preventing students from lawfully carrying a concealed handgun on campus. The university opposed the bill, which quickly died in subcommittee. Virginia Tech spokesman Larry Hincker praised the defeat of the bill, stating, \\"I'm sure the university community is appreciative of the General Assembly's actions because this will help parents, students, faculty and visitors feel safe on our campus.\\" = Impact on state and local law = In August 2007, the Massengill Report recommended that the state's General Assembly adopt legislation \\"establishing the right of every institution of higher education to regulate the possession of firearms on campus if it so desires\\" and went on to recommend campus gun bans, \\"unless mandated by law.\\" The report also recommended gun control measures unrelated to the circumstances of the shooting, such as requiring background checks for all private firearms sales, including those at gun shows. Governor Kaine made it a priority to enact a private sale background check law in the 2008 Virginia General Assembly, but the bill was defeated in the Senate Courts of Justice Committee. Opponents of gun control viewed this larger move as an unwarranted expansion and as a possible prelude waypoint akin to full gun registration for all gun sales. The incident and its aftermath energized student activist efforts seeking to overturn bans that prevent gun holders (both \\"open carry\\" and \\"concealed carry permit\\" holders) from carrying their weapons on college campuses. Thirty-eight states throughout the U.S. ban weapons at schools; sixteen of those specifically ban guns on college campuses. A new group, Students for Concealed Carry on Campus, formed after the shooting; , it claimed to have 16,000 members at 500 campuses nationwide. Several states considered legislation to allow gun permit holders to carry concealed firearms on university campuses. They cited cases of actual successful neutralization of active campus shooters by armed students to advance their cause. Another attempt by Delegate Gilbert to pass a law to allow concealed weapons on college campuses in Virginia was defeated in March 2008. This law was for the sake of students and faculty members only since the Attorney General ruled that it did not apply to non-students and non-faculty on campus who could carry concealed without restriction on campus. This law would have largely affected students 21 years or older since younger people are not allowed to purchase handguns. = Response = Woman with sign honoring her slain nephew - March for our Lives Washington, DC, 2018 The response to how gun laws affected the shooting was divided. According to a White House statement, \\"The president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms, but that all laws must be followed\\". The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said that it was too easy for an individual to get powerful weapons and called for increased gun control measures. National Rifle Association board member Ted Nugent, commenting on CNN, called for an end to gun-free zones and contrasted the Virginia Tech shooting with other incidents in which mass shootings have been ended by law-abiding gun owners. Texas Governor Rick Perry proposed that licensed gun owners be allowed to carry their weapons anywhere in Texas. Some government officials in other countries joined in the criticism of U.S. gun laws and policies. For example, then- Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that stringent legislation introduced after a 1996 mass shooting in Tasmania had prevented a problematic gun culture in Australia. Virginia Governor Tim Kaine condemned the gun politics debate following the shooting, saying, \\"To those who want to make this into some sort of crusade, I say take this elsewhere.\\" Advocates opposed to gun control argued that they were merely responding to the crusade by some to use this tragedy as a basis for an expansion of gun control for issues beyond the shootings as perceived to be presented by the Virginia Tech Review Panel. The Review Panel members were: * Col. Gerald Massengill, Panel Chair, a retired Virginia State Police Superintendent * Dr. Marcus L. Martin, Panel Vice Chair, Professor of Emergency Medicine, Assistant Dean of the School of Medicine, and Associate Vice President for Diversity and Equity at the University of Virginia * Gordon Davies, former Director of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia and President of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education * Dr. Roger L. Depue, an FBI veteran and the founder, past president, and CEO of The Academy Group, Inc., a forensic behavioral sciences services company * Carroll Ann Ellis, MS, Director of the Fairfax County Police Department's Victim Services Division, a faculty member at the National Victim Academy, and a member of the American Society of Victimology * Tom Ridge, former Governor of Pennsylvania, former Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the first U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security * Dr. Aradhana A. \\"Bela\\" Sood, Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics, Chair of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Medical Director of the Virginia Treatment Center for Children at VCU Medical Center * Diane Strickland, former judge of the 23rd Judicial Circuit Court in Roanoke County and co-chair of the Boyd-Graves Conference on issues surrounding involuntary mental commitment  Legal aftermath  On June 17, 2008, Judge Theodore J. Markow approved an $11 million settlement in a suit against the state of Virginia by twenty-four of the thirty-two victims' families. Of the other eight victims, two families chose not to file claims, while two remain unresolved. The settlement also covered eighteen people who were injured; their lifelong health care needs were included in the settlement. The Department of Education fined the University $55,000 on March 29, 2011, for waiting too long to notify students of the initial shootings. The fine was the highest amount that the Department of Education could levy for the two violations of the Clery Act resulting from the failure to notify students in a timely manner of the shootings in West Ambler Johnston. In announcing the fine against the University, the director of a department panel which reviewed the case was quoted as saying \\"While Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute, the department's fine authority is limited\\". As of March 30, 2011, the University had announced its intention to appeal the decision. On March 14, 2012, a jury found that Virginia Tech was guilty of negligence for delaying a campus warning. The parents of two students who were killed filed a wrongful death civil lawsuit that argued that lives could have been spared if school officials had moved more quickly to alert the campus after the first two victims were shot in a dorm. On March 30, 2012, a federal judge overturned the Department of Education's 2011 $55,000 fine, finding that Virginia Tech did not violate the Clery Act. Ernest Canellos, administrative law judge for the Department of Education, found that Virginia Tech's initial conclusion was reasonable that the initial shootings in West Ambler Johnston were a domestic incident and didn't represent an ongoing threat, even though that was later proven wrong. Canellos wrote, \\"This was not an unreasonable amount of time in which to issue a warning. If the later shootings at Norris Hall had not occurred, it is doubtful that the timing of the e-mail would have been perceived as too late.\\" On September 1, 2012, Education Secretary Arne Duncan reinstated half the fine‚Äì$27,500‚Äìreversing the decision by Canellos. In the statement released when the fine was reinstated, Duncan wrote, \\"Although the police department hypothesized that the crime was 'domestic in nature', the record is clear that the respondent had not located the suspect, had not found the weapon, and was confronted with the distinct possibility that the gunman was armed and still at large.\\" Virginia Tech spokesman Larry Hincker issued a statement, saying, \\"Once again, the higher education community has been put on notice that timeliness is situational and will be determined by department officials after the fact.\\" On October 31, 2013, the Virginia Supreme Court reversed the lower state court jury's 2012 ruling that the University had been negligent in warning students quickly enough about Cho's impending rampage. The trial judge in the lower court had instructed the jury that there was a \\"special relationship\\" between the school and slain students Erin Nicole Peterson and Julia Kathleen Pryde, since the two women were \\"business invitees\\" of the University. The two women's families had filed that particular lawsuit. In rejecting the decision, the state Supreme Court said that \\"even if there was a special relationship between the Commonwealth (meaning the state of Virginia, and its affiliated agencies, such as Virginia Tech) and students of Virginia Tech ... there was no duty for the Commonwealth to warn students about the potential for criminal acts by third parties.\\" The state has claimed that ultimate responsibility rested with Cho for not seeking assistance prior to the shooting. The two families had not joined in a previous settlement with the other families. Education Secretary Duncan agreed to an additional $5,000 fine on January 3, 2014; the Federal Office of Student Aid had sought an additional $27,500. An administrative law judge reduced the amount and Duncan agreed to the reduction. At the time, Virginia Tech announced that it was considering appeals on both fines. Ultimately, Virginia Tech paid a total of $32,500 in February 2014, saying it was closing \\"this chapter on the tragedy of April 16, 2007,\\" without admitting wrongdoing. The announcement that the fines had been paid was made on April 16, 2014, the seventh anniversary of the shooting. A statement by Larry Hincker said, \\"While we believe that the department's actions against Virginia Tech are inconsistent with their earlier guidance and policy, further litigation was not prudent in light of the various costs‚Äîemotional impact on the community, time lost, as well as financial.\\"  See also  * List of rampage killers (school massacres) * List of school-related attacks * List of school shootings in the United States * Gun violence in the United States * Mass shootings in the United States  Sources  * Massengill Report: (Additional archive.)

It is one of the strongest dialects of the language on the mainland. Dialects A school named after C√¥tis-Capel who wrote in the Haguais form of Cotentinais Due to the relative lack of standardisation of Norman, there are five main subdialects of Cotentinais: # Haguais - La Hague, in the north west of the Cotentin Peninsula # Val de Saire, in the north east # Coutan√ßais du nord, to the north of the Coutances-Saint-L√¥ line # Coutan√ßais du sud, to the north of the Joret line # Baupteis, from Bauptois, between Carentan and La Haye-du-Puits History At the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century a new movement arose in the Channel Islands, led by writers such as George M√©tivier (Guernsey, 1790‚Äì1881 ‚Äî dubbed the Guernsey Burns) and writers from Jersey. The independent governments, lack of censorship and diverse social and political milieu of the Islands enabled a growth in the publication of vernacular literature ‚Äî often satirical and political. Most literature was published in the large number of competing newspapers, which also circulated in the neighbouring Cotentin, sparking a literary renaissance on the Norman mainland. The Norman poet C√¥tis-Capel (1915-1986) was a native of the Cotentin and used the landscape as inspiration for his poetry. The Norman language writer Alfred Rossel, native of Cherbourg, composed many songs which form part of the heritage of the region. Rossel's song Sus la m√© (\\"on the sea\\") is often sung as a regional patriotic song. Subdialect characteristics Each sub-group has some characteristics which made it possible to define them: The dialect of La Hague is very guttural, in particular by the hard pronunciation of Norman aspirated H (\\"Hague\\" is typically pronounced [hrague] in the region). It pronounces the verbs of the first group with final in [ - has ]: (to sing) is read [chanhanta] / Éa…îÃÉt…ë/. It is the same for the conjugation with the last participle. Exception, in the two communes of Cap de La Hague (Auderville and Saint-Germain-des-Vaux) where one pronounces [chanhanto] / Éa…îÃÉto/. The dialect of the Val de Saire, pronounces in the same way finals of the verbs of the first group in [-o]: acataer (to buy) is read [acato]. With the past participle, even pronunciation, except with the female one: [acata:] with one [-a:] length. Example: Ole a 'ta√© acata√©e sauns c√¢otioun will say [√¥lata: acata: sahan k√¢ossiahon] = (it was bought without guarantee) The dialects of north and south Coutan√ßais pronounce the verbs of the first group and their participle past in [-√¢√©] or [-√¢√®]: (to catch) is thus said [hrap√¢√©]. Caught will result in happa√©e [hrappa√©e]. The difference between these two group resides more on the pronunciation of [q≈≠-] Norman. Here, for q≈≠yin (dog), one will say [ki'i], [tchi], or [] (with one [-hin] final hardly audible). for comparison, let us recall that in Cauchois, one says [ki'in]. The Baupteis, the dialect of Bauptois, are close to the languages of Coutan√ßais for the verbs to first group and it [q≈≠-]. On the other hand, it has the characteristic to pronounce it [√¢o] cotentinais in [√®], which does not facilitate comprehension of it. This provision did not appear besides in the dialectal literature and thus almost disappeared. Where everywhere in Normandy one says c√¢osaer (to discuss), marked [k√¢oza, k√¢ozo, k√¢oza√©, k√¢oza√®, or k√¢oz√©] according to preceding sub-groups' and as a Norman Southerner [k√¢oz√©], the language of Bauptois will say [k√®za√©] or [k√®z√¢√®] or rarely [k√®za]. Thus the c√¢ode i√¢o (hot water) will say it [k√®di√®]. B√¢opteis decides there besides [b√®t√©:]. Literature cotentinaise Each sub-group thus also has its Norman language authors who, even if they have used or contributed to the development of a coherent and unified orthography, have written texts specific to each sub-group, but readable by all. Thus, the rich vocabulary of Cotentinais was turned to literary purpose by several poets and writers at the 19th and 20th centuries, in particular: # La Hague dialect: Alphonse Allain, C√¥tis-Capel # Val de Saire dialect: Alfred No√´l # northern Coutan√ßais dialect : Louis Beuve, Fran√ßois √ânault, Marcel Dalarun # southern Coutan√ßais dialect : Louis Beuve # Bauptois dialect: Pierre Gu√©roult Alfred Rossel, precursor of the writing into Norman of Cotentin writes Norman \\"area of Cherbourg\\", i.e. between this city and Valognes, which can be connected to the sub-groups of La Hague, the Valley of Saire and Bauptois. Future This variety of Norman that is Cotentinais, is still spoken today, but in small number, and cultural activity is maintained by some folk associations (songs, dances, magazines) and especially by the Mag√®ne association which aims to safeguard and to promote Norman by publishing of discs and books.

El Crimen de Cuenca is the title of a book published at the same time by the author of the movie script, (Lola) Salvador Maldonado, in which she recounts the same facts. The film was entered into the 30th Berlin International Film Festival. The film was the highest-grossing Spanish film in Spain with a gross of 460 million pesetas, a record it held until surpassed by Los santos inocentes (1984). Historical facts On 21 August 1910, in the small town of Osa de la Vega, in the province of Cuenca, Jose Maria Grimaldos, known as ¬´El Cepa¬ª (the stump), is seen on the road to the nearby village of Tresjuncos and then disappears. His family fears foul play and reports it to the Guardia Civil (rural police). In the subsequent judicial investigation the family and others express their suspicions that two men, Gregorio Valero and Leon Sanchez had killed him for his money. This first case was closed in September 1911 with no convictions. In 1913 a new, young and overzealous judge named Isasa arrives.El crimen de Cuenca: cien a√±os de un asesinato sin muerto Influenced by the local boss, Judge Isasa decides to reopen the case. The two suspects are arrested by the Guardia Civil and under torture, confess to having killed the man and destroyed the body. The fiscal (district attorney) asks for the death penalty for both. Finally, on 25 May 1918 a popular jury convicted the two men of murder and they are sentenced to 18 years in prison. After serving eleven years, they are released under a general pardon on 20 February 1924. Two years later, in early 1926, it is discovered by chance that the reputed victim, Grimaldos, ¬´El Cepa¬ª, was alive and had been living in a nearby town. The ugly truth is thus revealed and the innocence of the convicted men becomes evident. With many legal difficulties, the case is reopened and eventually reached the Supreme Court, where the convictions were overturned. The film Based on these facts, writer Ram√≥n J. Sender, wrote the novel El lugar de un hombre (The Place of a Man) in 1939 and later, in 1979, Pilar Miro directed the movie based on the story while Maldonado published her book. The movie is an attack against torture and it is understood that the crime in the title is committed by the Guardia Civil in torturing the suspects. The torture scenes are depicted in great detail and crudity and the movie was initially banned in Spain and the director subjected to military courts martial. Only in August 1981 was the film allowed to be shown in Spain where it was a box office success.

Bernardi and colleagues first uncovered the compositional non-uniformity within vertebrate genomes using thermal melting and density gradient centrifugation. The DNA fragments extracted by the gradient centrifugation were later termed \\"isochores\\", which was subsequently defined as \\"very long (much greater than 200 KB) DNA segments\\" that \\"are fairly homogeneous in base composition and belong to a small number of major classes distinguished by differences in guanine-cytosine (GC) content\\". Subsequently, the isochores \\"grew\\" and were claimed to be \\">300 kb in size.\\" The theory proposed that isochore‚Äôs composition varied markedly between \\"warm- blooded\\" (homeotherm) vertebrates and \\"cold-blooded\\" (poikilotherm) vertebrates and later became known as the isochore theory.  The thermodynamic stability hypothesis  The isochore theory purported that the genome of \\"warm-blooded\\" vertebrates (mammals and birds) are mosaics of long isochoric regions of alternating GC-poor and GC-rich composition, as opposed to the genome of \\"cold-blooded\\" vertebrates (fishes and amphibians) that were supposed to lack GC-rich isochores. These findings were explained by the thermodynamic stability hypothesis, attributing genomic structure to body temperature. GC-rich isochores were purported to be a form of adaptation to environmental pressures, as an increase in genomic GC-content could protect DNA, RNA, and proteins from degradation by heat. Despite its attractive simplicity, the thermodynamic stability hypothesis has been repeatedly shown to be in error . Many authors showed the absence of a relationship between temperature and GC-content in vertebrates, while others showed the existence of GC-rich domains in \\"cold-blooded\\" vertebrates such as crocodiles, amphibians, and fish.  Principles of the isochore theory  The isochore theory was the first to identify the nonuniformity of nucleotide composition within vertebrate genomes and predict that the genome of \\"warm-blooded\\" vertebrates such as mammals and birds are mosaic of isochores (Bernardi et al. 1985). The human genome, for example, was described as a mosaic of alternating low and high GC content isochores belonging to five compositional families, L1, L2, H1, H2, and H3, whose corresponding ranges of GC contents were said to be <38%, 38%-42%, 42%-47%, 47%-52%, and >52%, respectively. The main predictions of the isochore theory are that: * GC content of the third codon position (GC3) of protein coding genes is correlated with the GC content of the isochores embedding the corresponding genes. * The genome organization of warm-blooded vertebrates is a mosaic of mostly GC-rich isochores. * Genome organization of cold-blooded vertebrates is characterized by low GC content levels and lower compositional heterogeneity than warm-blooded vertebrates. Homogeneous domains do not reach the high GC levels attained by the genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates.  The neutralist-selectionist controversy  Two opposite explanations that endeavored to explain the formations of isochores were vigorously debated as part of the neutralist-selectionist controversy. The first view was that isochores reflect variable mutation processes among genomic regions consistent with the neutral model. Alternatively, isochores were posited as a result of natural selection for certain compositional environment required by certain genes. Several hypotheses derive from the selectionist view, such as the thermodynamic stability hypothesis and the biased gene conversion hypothesis. Thus far, none of the theories provides a comprehensive explanation to the genome structure, and the topic is still under debate.  The rise and fall of the isochore theory  The isochore theory became one of the most useful theories in molecular evolution for many years. It was the first and most comprehensive attempt to explain the long- range compositional heterogeneity of vertebrate genomes within an evolutionary framework. Despite the interest in the early years in the isochore model, in recent years, the theory‚Äôs methodology, terminology, and predictions have been challenged. Because this theory was proposed in the 20th century before complete genomes were sequenced, it could not be fully tested for nearly 30 years. In the beginning of the 21st century, when the first genomes were made available it was clear that isochores do not exist in the human genome nor in other mammalian genomes. When failed to find isochores, many attacked the very existence of isochores. The most important predictor of isochores, GC3 was shown to have no predictable power to the GC content of nearby genomicregions, refuting findings from over 30 years of research, which were the basis for many isochore studies. Isochore-originators replied that the term was misinterpreted as isochores are not \\"homogeneous\\" but rather fairly homogeneous regions with a heterogeneous nature (especially) of GC-rich regions at the 5 kb scale, which only added to the already growing confusion. The reason for this ongoing frustration was the ambiguous definition of isochores as long and homogeneous, allowed some researchers to discover \\"isochores\\" and others to dismiss them, although both camps used the same data. The unfortunate side effect of this controversy was an \\"arms race\\" in which isochores are frequently redefined and relabeled following conflicting findings that failed to reveal \\"mosaic of isochores.\\" The unfortunate outcomes of this controversy and the following terminological-methodological mud were the loss of interest in isochores by the scientific community. When the most important core-concept in isochoric literature, the thermodynamic stability hypothesis, was rejected, the theory lost its appeal. Even today, there is no clear definition to isochores nor is there an algorithm that detects isochores. Isochores are detected manually by visual inspection of GC content curves , however because this approach lacks scientific merit and is difficult to replicate by independent groups, the findings remain disputed.  The compositional domain model  As the study of isochores was de facto abandoned by most scientists, an alternative theory was proposed to describe the compositional organization of genomes in accordance with the most recent genomic studies. The Compositional Domain Model depicts genomes as a medley of short and long homogeneous and nonhomogeneous domains. The theory defines \\"compositional domains\\" as genomic regions with distinct GC-contents as determined by a computational segmentation algorithm. The homogeneity of compositional domains is compared to that of the chromosome on which they reside using the F-test, which separated them into compositionally homogeneous domains and compositionally nonhomogeneous domains based on the outcome of test. Compositionally homogeneous domains that are sufficiently long (‚â• 300 kb) are termed isochores or isochoric domains. These terms are in accordance with the literature as they provide clear distinction between isochoric- and nonisochoric-domains. A comprehensive study of the human genome unraveled a genomic organization where two-thirds of the genome is a mixture of many short compositionally homogeneous domains and relatively few long ones. The remaining portion of the genome is composed of nonhomogeneous domains. In terms of coverage, only 1% of the total number of compositionally homogeneous domains could be considered \\"isochores\\" which covered less than 20% of the genome. Since its inception the theory received wide attention and was extensively used to explain findings emerging from over dozen new genome sequencing studies. yet many important questions remain open, such as which evolutionary forces shaped the structure of compositional domain and how do they differ between different species?

He gained much recognition through his powerful clients and opened his own haute couture house in Paris in 1858, which sold luxury fashion to upper-class women. Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture In 1868 the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture was created to set the specifications to determine what constituted a ‚Äòcouture house‚Äô.Di Boscio, Chere. \\"Timeline: The History of Haute Couture.\\" Eluxe Magazine. 31 Jan. 2015. Web. 5 Feb. 2016. The group decided that to be defined a piece of haute couture the clothing must have been; custom-made to fit the wearer, hand-sewn by multiple skilled artisans in the separate fields of embroidery, stitching, and beading, and only the most high quality of materials may be used. L‚ÄôAssociation de Protection des Industries Artistiques Saisonnieres Fifty-three years after the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture was created, in 1921 the French press created L‚ÄôAssociation de Protection des Industries Artistiques Saisonnieres, or PAIS to protect couture designs from being copied. To ensure the copyright of the designers, their creations were photographed on a model or mannequin from the front, back, and sides to catalog the design. The first Paris Fashion Week In 1945 the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture established another set of rules to regulate and determine Haute Couture houses. In order to meet the criteria, the house had to ensure they followed the updated rules with one of them being that in each season, a couture house must present a collection of at least 35 runs with both daytime and evening wear to the Paris press.Bazaar UK, Harper‚Äôs BAZAAR. \\"The History of Haute Couture.\\" Harper‚Äôs BAZAAR. N.p., 10 July 2014. Web. 1 Feb. 2016. Others included having at least 20 members on staff, and that every design must include fittings and be made-to-order for the clientele. The following biannual events of Haute Couture houses in accordance with the new guidelines set by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture have been seen as the first pair of fashion weeks in Paris. First fashion week under the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de la Couture The first recognized Paris Fashion Week was held in October 1973 and organized Haute Couture, Ready-to-Wear, and Men's Fashion into one grouped showing by the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de la Couture.\\"History of Fashion Week.\\" Fashion Week Online.

The amount aimed to reach to repair the palace was estimated at US$60 million which converts to 53,026,956 Euros. The fundraiser was started because the French government had stated they could not handle the cost of the renovations. It was overseen by the founder of New York Press Week, now known as New York Fashion Week, Eleanor Lambert, in accordance with, the at the time Versailles curator, G√©rald Van der Kemp. The restorations and renovations included Marie Antoinette‚Äôs dressing room, Louis XV‚Äôs children‚Äôs play room, and a staircase which began construction in 1722 but was never finished.Banks, Alec. \\"Paris Fashion Week History.\\" Highsnobiety.

Both American and Parisian designers attended the event including; Anne Klein, Bill Blass, Stephen Burrows, Oscar de la Renta, Hubert de Givenchy, and Yves Saint Laurent. The French designer‚Äôs each held their own showing set to various themes whose pieces included; a rocket ship, pumpkin coach and a rhinoceros pulling a gypsy caravan. The American designers, due to errors in measurement conversion, collectively held one showing under the common theme of Paris using both Caucasian and African-American models. The American designers‚Äô use of diversity in models marked the event as the first time African-American models had walked a French runway. The event gained much publicity because of the designers involved and is given the nickname \\"The Battle of Versailles\\" because of its location and the tension between the American and Parisian designers during the run of the show.  Controversies  = Size-zero ban = According to the French law, Fashion Week does not allow models of a body mass index size zero to attend. = Age limits = Paris Fashion Week prohibits models under 18 years of age.

Despite the title it was planned to connect other railways at Llanidloes and Pencader, near Carmarthen, and achieve the object in its name by connections with other lines, most of which were only planned. The M&MR; had continuous difficulty in raising capital and also in operating profitably, but thanks to a wealthy supporter it opened from Pencader to Lampeter in 1866. Realising that its originally intended route to Llanidloes would be unprofitable, it diverted the course at the north end to Aberystwyth, which it reached in 1867. Sunk by financial difficulties, it was eventually absorbed into the Great Western Railway in 1911. Passenger operation ceased in 1964 and milk trains ran to a creamery until final closure in 1973. Early schemes In the early years of the nineteenth century, Manchester and the surrounding districts had become dominant in many manufacturing industries, particularly textiles. As the volume of the trade increased, the import of raw materials, and the export and coastal transport of finished goods assumed an ever more important consideration in the industrial process. The port of Liverpool was conveniently located and became the chief west coast port, and as trade with the Americas developed, Liverpool grew in importance. The cost and time taken for transport to and from Liverpool was nevertheless significant, and the existing water-borne transport routes were expensive and slow. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was opened, immediately becoming a financial and commercial success. Although it was prime, Liverpool was not the only west coast port‚Äîit was rivalled by Bristol‚Äîbut the thoughts of some business people turned to alternatives, and in 1845 the Manchester and Milford Haven Railway was proposed. This would create a new deep water port on Milford HavenMilford Haven the body of water, not the railway station. in south-west Wales, and build a railway line connecting to Manchester. Milford Haven had the advantage of being located further west than Liverpool, with a corresponding shortening of the sea passage. The route was to start at Crewe, already connected to Manchester by the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, and run by way of Oswestry, Devil's Bridge, Lampeter and Haverfordwest. The line was to be broad gauge although the difficulties of the break of gauge at the northern end were not clearly elucidated. By planning to build a line to Milford Haven, the company would have been in conflict with the South Wales Railway, which had issued a prospectus the previous year (1844) for a line connecting the Great Western Railway and Fishguard, also with a view to the transatlantic trade although mainly focussed on communication with Ireland. The South Wales Railway was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Brunel began to have doubts about Fishguard, and he too adopted Neyland, a port on Milford Haven. The South Wales Railway was built, but the Manchester and Milford Haven Railway came to nothing. The scheme was to cost ¬£2.6 million. The scheme \\"failed to materialize and lay dormant for several years, during which time other companies had covered the intended route, except for the 51 miles through central Wales from Llanidloes to Pencader.\\" Map of the Manchester and Milford Railway, as first authorised by ParliamentThis was the time of the railway mania, when money was cheap and any number of railway schemes were put forward. The blank area on the map without main line railways, and the west- facing expanse of coast in Cardigan Bay proved alluring to railway promoters. Contemporary with the M&MR; scheme was a North and South Wales and Worcester Railway, which proposed construction from Carmarthen to Aberystwyth and Machynlleth; it too failed to progress, and these proposals were followed by a series of schemes for linking the industrial north-west with south-west Wales. The barrier of the Cambrian mountains proved an engineering challenge which in many cases was underestimated at the planning stage. The Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway was promoted to connect Cardigan to the South Wales Railway and thence the railway network. It was authorised by Parliament in 1854, although only for a line between Carmarthen and Newcastle Emlyn. Extension to Cardigan, and construction of a deep water port there, was to follow later. The Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway was presumed to be a useful ally in what might become a chain of railways, shortening the extent of new construction necessary between Manchester and the port. The Manchester and Milford Railway authorised By 1859 the idea of what was now to be the Manchester and Milford Railway was taking shape; it was to be built from Llanidloes \\"accessible from the north via either the Great Western Railway or the London and North Western Railway\\" to Pencader, where it would join the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway. The prospectus was enthusiastic: > Railways are now either made or in course of construction from Manchester to > Welshpool. Two lines converge at the latter town, one by way of Chester and > Oswestry in the Great Western interest, and the other by way of Shrewsbury > in the London & North Western interest... From Welshpool railways are either > opened or being constructed southward to Llanidloes. > The proposed Manchester & Milford Railway commences at Llanidloes and passes > by the Devil's Bridge, through the Lead Mining Country, and through > Cardiganshire, by Tregaron and Lampeter to a junction with the Carmarthen & > Cardigan Railway at Pencader, near Newcastle Emlyn. From this point the > Carmarthen & Cardigan Railway is in course of construction to Carmarthen, > there joining the South Wales Railway, which is complete to [Neyland]. > The proposed line is miles long, on the narrow gauge, uniting the north and > south railways between Manchester and Milford, by the shortest route. To > prevent a break of gauge near Carmarthen, it will be necessary to lay down > an extra rail on the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway, a portion of the South > Wales Railway, and the Milford [Haven branch] Railway. The first and last of > these companies consent, and it is not known or expected that the South > Wales Railway will object. The distance between Manchester and Milford would > then be about 207 miles.Statement of Facts in documents submitted to > Parliament by the promoters in 1860, quoted in Llanidloes was on the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, opened in 1859, and the access to the GWR and LNWR was by no means as clear cut as suggested. The running powers beyond the extremities of the line were not secured. Construction and land acquisition costs were understated and traffic earnings to be expected were overstated, but on 23 July 1860 the Manchester and Milford Railway was authorised by Parliament, with share capital of ¬£555,000. An apparently firm arrangement had already been made with Frederick Beeston to construct the line for ¬£447,000. Construction David Davies and Thomas Savin were prominent railway contractors in Wales at the time, and offered to take shares in the concern as payment for construction of the northern part of the line. The company appear to have invited Savin to meet Beeston to discuss the sharing of the contract work, but unsurprisingly Beeston declined. Raising subscriptions to fund the construction of the line proved exceedingly difficult, and throughout its life the line was under-capitalised. The main physical obstacle was the great mass of the Cambrian Mountains just south of Plynlimon, separating West Wales from the Severn Valley; it was to be tunnelled as part of the 50 mile section between Llanidloes and Pencader. The Mid-Wales Railway had been authorised in 1859 to build from Llanidloes to Newbridge-on-Wye, and the Manchester and Milford now realised that the other company's authorised alignment was largely over the same terrain as its own for two miles or so from Llanidloes south to a place called Penpontbren. The M&MR;'s reaction was to persuade Frederick Beeston to build that section at once, so as to pre-empt the intentions of the Mid-Wales, which had not done much in its first year. Beeston agreed to do this for ¬£30,000 and ¬£10,000 in paid-up shares; this was accepted by the M&MR;, but the company did not have that amount of cash available, and persuaded Beeston to take the payment in instalments, and in paid-up shares at a 33% discount. All this was contingent on the M&MR; acquiring the land, but the MWR was already negotiating with landowners, and the idea of stealing a march on the MWR was impossible. An uninspiring series of disingenuous proposals followed, eventually leading to legal action. At length the solution was arrived at: the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway had been authorised in 1859 to build east from Llanidloes, and was in the process of construction; indeed the M&MR; always planned to make an end-on junction with it. If the L&NR; were to build the two miles of disputed route (as far south as Penpontbren), and make that part of its line available solely to the M&MR; and the MWR, then the problem would be solved. A Parliamentary Bill for the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway was prepared for the 1862 session, and it was authorised in that year. The two companies were to pay it 5% per annum on capital, and there was to be a joint station at Llanidloes; the Manchester and Milford was to pay a third of the running costs of the station and interest on its capital cost. The L&NR; pressed ahead with construction, and the section to Penpontbren and the joint Llanidloes station were completed in February 1864, and the L&NR; transferred its own trains to the joint station, demoting its own terminus to a goods station. The Mid-Wales Railway too was building its line, and opened this part of it in September 1864, from which date it started using the \\"shared\\" route section and the joint station. Meanwhile the M&MR; set about building west from Penpontbren; it managed three miles as far as the village of Llangurig, which was completed in 1864, construction then being halted. The section was laid with double track; only one goods is train is known to have reached Llangurig. Soon after leaving the village, there was a 2.2 km long tunnel under Banc Merin (on which construction actually began) from Cae Gaer Roman fort to the Afon Merin valley; then another, and before reaching the coastal plain of West Wales it would have crossed a viaduct 280 ft high over the Afon Ystwyth at Pont Rhyd-y- Groes. Hopes of one day completing the line remained, and meetings were held in 1872 proposing that, but it was a lost cause. Relations with Frederick Beeston, the M&MR;'s contractor, were difficult, and it is obvious that the M&MR;, having little money in the capital account, had been unable to secure the land necessary for Beeston to make much progress. Notwithstanding the contract with Beeston (part of which was transferred by agreement to his son, Frederick Beeston junior in 1861), the company now negotiated with Savin over taking on much of the construction. Savin was prepared to finance the work himself, taking shares in payment as well as ¬£100,000 in cash at some later date. Beeston immediately sent a letter threatening a lawsuit if his pre- existing contract were interfered with, and for the time being matters stalled. The M&MR; route as authorised was to run more or less direct from Lampeter through Tregaron and Devil's Bridge to Pant Mawr and Llanidloes. The intermediate terrain was thinly populated and had limited industrial activity, the objective being to connect Manchester and the port in south-west Wales as directly as possible. The M&MR; now began to reconsider the wisdom of this, and decided to build to Aberystwyth from Devil's Bridge. Ignoring its great difficulty in raising capital, the M&MR; obtained an Act in July 1861 for this extension, with additional capital authorised of ¬£110,000, and in November 1861 the company proposed a further branch, known as the Rhayader branch, and in the Parliamentary session of 1863 a harbour branch and other connections at Aberystwyth were being proposed. Now the route was to run along the east side of the River Teifi valley from Pencader via Llanybydder, Lampeter, Tregaron, Pontrhydfendigaid, Ysbyty Ystwyth and Pontrhydygroes to Devil‚Äôs Bridge. There, a junction station would be constructed, with the main line proceeding to Llanidloes, and a branch line to . Boardroom politics The Company had never succeeded in generating share subscriptions to carry out its construction. There were two strong personalities on the Board, William Chambers and John Barrow, and it was their personal money and sureties that allowed any expenditure at all. At a shareholders' meeting in February 1863 all other directors were voted off, and friends and relatives of John Barrow were elected as Directors. However there had not been a quorum at the meeting, and the decision was therefore supposedly in vain. Now the question arose of reimbursement of cash put forward by the two principals in the interests of the company, and allegations of financial impropriety were laid. By August 1863 the whole business was settled, with William Chambers leaving the Board and John Barrow and his friends took over. The accounts for the period prior to this episode were clouded with controversy, but more pressing were two facts: that expenditure greatly exceeded income; and all the calls on the issued shares had been made. Moreover the next section of construction was to be the most challenging in engineering terms, involving two tunnels together , and an exceptionally large viaduct. The money to build this section was not available: at the end of 1863 only ¬£7,953 had been received in subscriptions from shareholders out of authorised capital of ¬£666,000. Moreover ¬£41,760 worth of shares had been issued to the contractors and landowners, and ¬£9,563 had been obtained in loans. Changing the route The financial situation encouraged an alteration to the intended route. By now the Company had completed the line to Llangurig and the Llanidloes and Newton Railway had connected to that. A more southerly alignment to get to Llangurig was proposed, forming a triangular junction with the authorised Aberystwyth branch where it intersected, at Ystrad Meurig. The new alignment involved of 1 in 30 and of 1 in 45; these gradients were on what was intended to be a trunk railway line. At the southern end the line was still to end abruptly at Pencader, where there was no mention of onward running powers over the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway. At this stage two other railways, the Mid Wales Railway and the Swansea and Aberystwyth Junction Railway, were planning lines in the area. After considerable jockeying for position, in October 1864 there was agreement to work jointly and present Parliamentary Bills that did not conflict. This meant that the M&MR; only required to build to Aberystwyth with a short stub to Yspytty Ystwyth, and could rely on the Mid Wales to build the connection to Llangurig (already reached by the M&MR;) as well as the Mid Wales' own eastward route. All three companies got their authorising Acts in 1865, (the M&MR; on 5 July), but the Swansea and Aberystwyth Junction almost immediately gave up for want of subscriptions. The M&MR; was able to reduce its intended capital by ¬£175,000 while the Mid Wales took on an additional ¬£380,000, way beyond any realistic possibility of raising the sum. This time the Act compelled the broad gauge Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway to lay a third rail to enable the passage of M&MR; , narrow gauge in this context, trains, and grant running powers to do so to Carmarthen from Pencader. The section of line from Llangurig to Penpontbren, about , was completed in 1863, including track and signals, but was never opened as a railway. It was finally dismantled about 1923. Opening the line The 1865 Act unlocked some loan capital but it must be presumed that John Barrow funded much of the construction with personal money; the line was completed and opened from Pencader to Lampeter, opening on 1 January 1866.Baughan says that Colonel Yolland of the Board of Trade inspected the line in December 1865 and refused sanction to open; that the line nonetheless opened on 1 January 1866; and that Yolland visited again on 24 January, noting the unauthorised opening; and merely referred to an undertaking to lengthen Pencader station platforms \\"within a fortnight\\". the C&CR;, itself lacking money, had not laid the necessary third rail for through running, and the M&MR; instructed its own contractor to lay the rail, as authorised in the 1865 Act. M&MR; trains were extended over the C&CR; to Carmarthen on 1 November 1866. Onwards to Strata Florida, the line was opened on 1 September 1866. Ystrad Meurig was retitled Strata Florida, after a local ruined abbey. The third rail to Carmarthen was ready at the end of August as well. The entire route of 41 miles was ready to be opened throughout, and this was done for passenger and goods trains on 12 August 1867. The construction and ancillary expenditure amounted to ¬£700,000, of which ¬£75,000 was on the Llangurig section, now abandoned. The train service consisted of three trains each way Monday to Friday. At first the service was operated by the contractors, using three Sharp, Stewart locomotives. Considering itself to be a trunk line, the M&MR; publicity quoted connections from Liverpool and Manchester to Milford. Before the 1867 opening this took two full days, and was a little shortened after that. At first the M&MR; trains could not run south of Pencader, of course. The M&MR; cultivated the Pembroke and Tenby Railway as an ally, and quoted journeys from Tenby northwards that involved travelling west to Pembroke and crossing to Neyland GWR station, as the P&TR; had not opened to Whitland yet. The train service on the M&MR; remained pitifully slow, and onward connections were not easily made so that the Manchester to Milford Journey in mixed trains attaching wagons at wayside stations, was not pleasant for passengers. System map of the Manchester and Milford Railway in 1872From the end of July 1872, passenger trains ceased running south of Pencader; this was probably due to extreme financial difficulties forcing a reduction in running costs. The Mid Wales Railway should have been extending westwards to Yspytty Ystwyth to connect with the authorised M&MR; section to that place; but as there was no sign of that happening, the M&MR; did not waste money on its own section of the route. Instead it decided to build a branch to Devil's Bridge; not yet a tourist attraction, it had mineral deposits in the vicinity. The M&MR; got Parliamentary authority for this in 1873. ¬£40,000 of capital was allowed to build the 7 mile line from Trawscoed. There proved to be no possibility of raising the money for this line and in 1880 powers for abandonment were obtained. Financial crisis At Aberystwyth the M&MR; was using the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway's station by agreement, and was due to pay a charge for the usage, laid down in the A&WCR; Act of 1863. Similarly it had undertaken to pay a charge for its use of the Llanidloes station built by the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway. The M&MR; had agreed to the arrangement when Llanidloes was to be on its main line, although that had long been abandoned. The Cambrian Railways, as successor to both the other railways, managed to get the Llanidloes joint line and station declared \\"open\\" to traffic (a necessary stage in charging for its use) on 1 August 1872. When the bills came in six months later the M&MR; failed to pay and the Cambrian sued, and won. By July 1875 the M&MR; owed ¬£1,700 and the Cambrian arranged to have powers to seize the M&MR; rolling stock. The M&MR; was obliged to pay immediately. These issues were only part of the financial problem that the line faced, having almost no conventional share capital other than that funded directly by John Barrow, and having taken out extremely large loans, on which unpaid interest was accruing at ¬£8,000 a year over and above ordinary profit and loss. In mid-1875 ¬£62,500 in arrears of interest were owing, and the company went into administration. The Manchester and Milford tried to claim against the Mid Wales Railway, which, it contended, should have built the connecting line from Llangurig to Strata Florida, which would have enabled the M&MR; to use the expensively acquired rights at Llanidloes, but the attempt was rejected in the House of Lords. There followed a long period of unedifying Board disagreements with the receiver, and improbably schemes that supposedly would resolve the company's financial ailments. The very thin trains service in this period was three mixed trains a day over the line, still with connections shown from Manchester and Liverpool but indicating a very exhausting and uncertain journey. In 1880 an initiative was taken to run the trains to time, which appears to have been successfully implemented. Income slightly improved in this time, and some work was done on relaying the track with recovered materials from the disused Llangurig spur line. In 1888 there was a surplus on operating account of ¬£5,750, but all of the \\"profit\\" was eaten up immediately by backlogs of rent and interest charges; the backlog continued to increase. However in 1889 the Regulation of Railways Act was passed, requiring the installation of block signalling interlocking of points and signals, and continuous brakes on passenger trains; all of this would cost money that the M&MR; did not have. Lease to the GWR It had long been obvious that there was no self-created escape from the M&MR;'s financial difficulty. In 1896 negotiations with the GWR took place, but the M&MR;'s anticipated price was way too high. The discussions were resumed in 1903 with a similar outcome. Much of the problem was the prior debt owed to the Cambrian Railways, which any purchaser would have to factor into their calculations. Conversely it was obvious that the rolled up debt was never going to be paid by the M&MR;, so that the Cambrian as creditor was also in a weak position. In October 1903 the Great Western Railway and the Cambrian Railways discussed what progress might be made in one of them taking over the M&MR.; At first the discussions were cordial, but the M&MR; played them off. In the 1904 session of Parliament a Bill was passed which had the effect of eliminating the M&MR; debt to the Cambrian, as a first step towards an agreed transfer, but the M&MR; then finalised a deal with the Great Western, to start on 1 July 1905. As well as resolving the historic debt issues, the GWR would pay 19% of gross receipts. The M&MR; had to get the sanction of the Court of Chancery, and this was withheld until the Cambrian had had a chance to comment; they were offering 25% of receipts. The matter was not quickly resolved, but the Cambrian was regarded locally as an inefficient monopoly, and it had not paid a dividend for some time. Its 25% was thought to be shaky compared with the solid 19% of the GWR. With the Cambrian accepting ¬£11,000 in settlement of past and future liabilities on the Llanidloes line, progress was at last possible and in May 1906 an amended Bill sanctioning the transfer (actually a 999 year lease) to the GWR was passed, to be effective from 1 July 1906. At this time the company's fleet consisted of eight engines, fourteen carriages and 117 goods vehicles. Operated by the GWR While the baseline traffic on the line was difficult to augment, the Great Western Railway fostered an increase in tourist traffic, especially from South Wales, on the line. In addition useful road motor connections were operated by the GWR to Aberayron and Newquay. A slip coach working was inaugurated: > \\"Slip\\" coaches are by no means a modern introduction, to railway workers but > until recently they were un-known in South Wales. The acquisition of the > Manchester and Milford Railway, and the opening of the Fishguard route to > Ireland, enabled the Great Western Railway to give an improved service to > Aberystwyth by means of a \\"slip\\" off the down morning boat express. The > \\"slip\\" which is detached at Carmarthen Junction, is the first seen in South > Wales, and the \\"slipping\\" is daily watched by a large number of local > railwayacs, who are much interested in the novelty. Lampeter, Aberayron and New Quay Light Railway Aberayron had long been considered to merit a railway branch line; the Vale of Rheidol Railway had intended to connect the town without success. In 1903 the idea for a light railway took shape, and in April 1911 the Lampeter, Aberayron and New Quay Light Railway was opened to traffic. It was worked from the outset by the Great Western Railway and the existing station facilities at Lampeter, which became the junction station, were considered to be adequate to handle the traffic. The geographical junction, named Aberayron Junction, was miles north of the station. Notwithstanding the reference to New Quay in the company's title, no extension to that place was built. Takeover by the GWR The GWR spent ¬£57,000 on bringing the M&MR; line up to a workable standard in the initial years of the lease. Discussions about a full takeover took place, as the M&MR; Company was now only a financial shell. Unpaid debenture interest and loans amounted to ¬£400,000 and the operating profit on the line did not leave enough surplus to pay current liabilities. The merger was inevitableIt is difficult to see what advantage the GWR derived from all this, other than preventing dominance at Aberystwyth by the Cambrian Railways and their ally the London and North Western Railway. and on 1 July 1911 the absorption of the Company by the Great Western took legal effect (by an Act of 2 June 1911). There were some trailing issued of financial clearing up for the residual M&MR; but the GWR took on responsibility for resolving the issues surrounding the uncompleted Llangurig extension. In the 1930s the passenger traffic on the line was further developed with five trains daily over the line, and additional services on summer Saturdays. During World War II the passenger service was reduced, but there was heavy munitions traffic running southbound. After 1948 At the beginning of 1948 the main line railways of Great Britain were taken into public ownership, under British Railways. The transfer brought relatively little change to the line, although some more modern engine power was brought in. A holiday camp opened at Penychain, near Pwllheli, in 1947; it was known as Butlin's Pwllheli, and it generated considerable seasonal passenger traffic. On summer Saturdays in the later 1950s and early 1960s through trains from Swansea or Carmarthen ran over the M&MR; to and from Pwllheli. For example the Summer 1960 public timetable for the Western Region of British Railways shows this train running on high summer Saturdays only at 10.10 am from Swansea to Pwllheli, calling at Carmarthen, Pencader, Lampeter and Aberystwyth; it reversed at Aberystwyth and again at Dovey Junction and arrived at Penychain (for the holiday camp) at 4.56 pm and Pwllheli at 5.5 pm. The southbound train ran from Penychain (10.18 am) to Carmarthen (3.55 pm) only, following the same route.British Railways Western Region, Passenger Services Timetable, 13 June to 11 September 1960 Closure The low baseline traffic levels on the line led to long-standing doubts about its future, and when the Beeching Report, The Reshaping of British Railways, was issued in 1963 it proposed that the line should close to traffic throughout. Attention was drawn to the social implications, in an area in need of commercial development, but the huge losses incurred by the line were dominant. During December 1963 the goods facilities at many stations were withdrawn, followed by more closures on 14 March 1964. On 14 December 1964 severe flooding of the River Ystwyth took place at Llanilar, severing the line there, and resulting in the immediate closure of the line north of Strata Florida. Formal closure of the passenger traffic on the whole line followed on 22 February 1965. Goods trains worked only as far as Pont Llanio where there was a creamery at Felin Fach, and Lampeter station became the railhead for general goods traffic. The Pont Llanio milk workings continued until the middle of 1970, and in October 1970 closure of that section took place. Green Grove on the Aberayron branch continued to generate milk traffic until the end of September 1973, when the entire system closed. The bay platform at Aberystwyth normally used by M&MR; passenger trains is now used by Vale of Rheidol Railway trains. Present A section from Aberystwyth to Tregaron now forms the Ystwyth Trail in Ceredigion. Locomotives Seven locomotives were acquired by the GWR in 1911, with the M&MR; by now operating only 10 locomotives: * 1 London & North Western Railway 0-6-0 built at Crewe in August 1880 as L&NWR; 2387\\\\.

There were steep gradients throughout the line, and generally the steepest were between 1 in 50 and 1 in 75. The line climbed from Pencader Junction to New Quay Road and then fell steeply for two miles. From there it continued undulating, generally rising northwards as far as Strata Florida where a one-mile climb at 1 in 46 took place. At the summit (at Corporation Siding) the line fell steeply at up to 1 in 41 for miles, and then more gently, with another, shorter steep descent at Llanrhystyd Road. Aberystwyth station was extensively modernised and remodelled in 1925. The work required the removal of the engine turntable, and a triangle was formed at the divergence of the former Cambrian and M&MR; lines for engine turning purposes; the third side of the triangle was not a running line, and it was never used as a through avoiding line for Aberystwyth station.

It is located east of Illapel, the province's administrative center, and north of Santiago, Chile. It is normally accessed from Los Vilos, which lies next to the Panamerican Highway, and connects the city to the rest of the country. Salamanca sits on the north bank of the Choapa River and within the Choapa valley. It was officially founded in 1844 by Joaqu√≠n de Ceballo, governor of Illapel. It is served by Las Brujas Airport.  History  Historical Review Matilde Salamanca The city of Salamanca was founded on November 29, 1844, by the Acting Governor of Illapel Joaquin Ceballos, By resolution of the Board of Hospitals Santiago, in the grounds of the Hacienda Choapa, at that time owned by the charity. The estate was owned by Matilde Salamanca, whose property by testamentary disposition became initially administered by the Church (1820) and then by decree of the Supreme Director Bernardo O'Higgins, Dated September 1, 1821, delivered to the public welfare. It was located on the north bank of the Choapa river, Next to an ancient Indian seat which formed part of the \\"Commit Choapa\\" And stood at the place now known as Chalinga. By 1897 Salamanca already had 2,000 inhabitants, while Chalinga 367 recorded documents that date, which is described as a small village whose plant comprises 48 blocks divided by straight streets \\"regular width.\\" Church already had, Telegraph Office and Civil Registration and Municipality seat constituted with jurisdiction over subdivisions in Peralillo Cerro Chico and Salamanca. Of the many farms that were part of the Choapa Making, some were parceled under the Homestead Act of 1928. however, in 1959 when the Agrarian Reform Corporation does not acquire the National Health Service (legal successor of the Public Welfare), the estates that formed the Hacienda Choapa, they still amounted to 253,000 has, Of which. Just over 8,000 acres were irrigated. In the late sixties as a result of the CORA program, a program of concentration of rural population Choapa Valley holds in villages that are located on both banks of the river of the same name, setting urban areas in 1982.  Early inhabitants  Its area has a long human occupation since the last glaciation. After finally succeeding 10,000 years ago these human groups have come parajes. Also, this town is known to be considered in previous years as a city witch, faithfully represented by autochthonous people like Jose Maria Olguin, of which several stories are told. = early occupation = Historical culture of the valley Between 8000 and 2500 BC, walking these bands of hunter-gatherer land, which are transferred from the coast in search of food. Gradually accessing these groups will develop an incipient agriculture (especially corn) associated with hunting guanacos. Between 300 BC and 200, burst into the valley agroalfareras populations originating in northwestern Argentina. Precisely these are from the first archaeological evidence of our past, as evidenced by the findings of St. Augustine, Grove, Chillep√≠n, Panguesillo and Salamanca. = Molle culture = These people, of uncertain origin, lived in valleys and gorges, relying on agriculture and livestock. They had simple knowledge of gold, silver, and copper metallurgy. They make simple pottery, knew the use of snuff or the like in the region and introduce a lip ornament made of stone: the tembet√°. Limited data on this culture for concluding that development in the area was marginal. = Diaguita culture = Theoretically it is believed that diaguitas came to Chile to the tenth century from Argentine northwest, across the mountains and valleys populating North Chico. The entities diaguitas tribes in the valley preferably devoted to hunting, agriculture and breeding, forming a pattern of semi-villager or villager settlement. The diaguitas developed a rich pottery finally decorated with geometric motifs, which evolved technically to the arrival of the Incas . Their political organization was characterized as constituted \\" dual lordships ,\\" i.e., the manors were divided into two installments, each governed by a chief lord . One half corresponded to the coast, the other part to the mountains or \\"top \\" of the valley where the valley diaguitas Choapa domains were located. Although the authors can not specify, or petroglyphs marked stones of the valley tend to be associated with diaguita . These stones and boulders covered with signs and drawings, are something of a precursor of writing, a way of perpetuating certain facts or data. Characteristics are petroglyphs Panguesillo, Chillep√≠n, Jorquera, Santa Rosa, Cerro Chico and Salamanca. = Inca rule = The ruler Tupac Inca Yupanqui (1471-1493) is credited with the conquest of the south extending their domains Tahuantisuyo in Diaguita territory. The expedition was prepared under the leadership of General Sinchiruca, with over ten thousand soldiers who fought for six years between Copiapo and Aconcagua. Some argue that the Inca domination lasted 50 to 75 years until the arrival of the Spaniards. The Inca invasion left across the region Choapa its civilizing footprint, managing to introduce a more rational exploitation on crops, taught the construction of roads and irrigation canals, as likewise the production of textiles, pottery and various household utensils. After the Inca invasion of Chile, of the Cordilleran area Petorca spent the Inca Trail in central Chile. The same was followed by Diego de Almagro (1536) and Pedro de Valdivia (1540) to enter the Aconcagua Valley and the Valley of the Mapocho River. Is interesting to note the existence of vestiges of \\"this Inca road\\" route built to transport military, trade and communications to maintain Incanato. This road was part of a network of twenty thousand kilometers paths between mountains and valleys. Since much remains are known in the valleys and Alicahue Petorca. In 1984 a section up to Cuncum√©n and Conchuca the dairy farm (dairy farms were places of rest and replenishment) was discovered. There are precedents for the existence of a coastal Inca Trail (still unknown), it must have passed through La Serena, Illapel and Ligua.  Demographics  According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Salamanca spans an area of and has 24,494 inhabitants (13,043 men and 11,451 women). Of these, 12,689 (51.8%) lived in urban areas and 11,805 (48.2%) in rural areas. The population grew by 5.9% (1,368 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.

He wrote in Guern√©siais, which is the indigenous language of the island. Among his poetical works are Rimes Guernesiaises published in 1831. M√©tivier blended together local place-names, bird and animal names, traditional sayings and orally transmitted fragments of medieval poetry to create themes. :Que l'lingo seit bouan ou mauvais / J'p√¢lron coum'nou p√¢lait autefais (whether the \\"lingo\\" be good or bad, I‚Äôm going to speak the way we spoke back then), wrote M√©tivier. He was born in Rue de la Fontaine, St Peter Port, Guernsey, in the night of 28‚Äì29 January 1790.La Gr√®ve de Lecq, Roger Jean Lebarbenchon, 1988 He used the pen-name Un C√¢telain, as his grandfather, a Huguenot by origin, had settled in Castel. As a young man, M√©tivier had studied in England and Scotland for a career in medicine, but had abandoned the idea of becoming a doctor to devote himself to linguistics and literature. His poems were published in Guernsey newspapers from 1813 until his death and since. George M√©tivier corresponded publicly in verse form with Robert Pipon Marett (\\"Laelius\\"), the J√®rriais poet. He translated the Gospel according to Matthew into Guern√©siais for publication by Prince Louis-Lucien Bonaparte, who visited him in 1862.La Gazette Officielle de Guernesey 13 September 1862 M√©tivier's close friend and prot√©g√© was Denys Corbet 1826-1909, born in Vale, Guernsey. Influence The first to produce a dictionary of the Norman language in the Channel Islands, M√©tivier's Dictionnaire Franco-Normand (1870), established the first standard orthography of Guern√©siais - later modified and modernised. At the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century a new movement arose in the Channel Islands, led by writers such as M√©tivier and writers from Jersey. The independent governments, lack of censorship and diverse social and political milieu of the Islands enabled a growth in the publication of vernacular literature ‚Äî often satirical and political. Most literature was published in the large number of competing newspapers, which also circulated in the neighbouring Cotentin peninsula, sparking a literary renaissance on the Norman mainland.

The estate was once the site of a Roman villa. Later it became a royal hunting ground, and then the property of Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley, who had an estate there from 1583 on. He was visited there by Queen Elizabeth I. King James VI and I and Anne of Denmark visited on 15 September 1603 with the French ambassador and a duke, who Arbella Stuart called the \\"Dutchkin.\\"Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1838), p. 26: Sara Jayne Steen, Letters of Lady Arbella Stuart (Oxford, 1994), p. 182. The 2nd Earl of Lichfield built the present house, designed by James Gibbs, in 1722. In 1933, the house was bought by an MP, Ronald Tree, whose wife Nancy Lancaster redecorated it in partnership with Sibyl Colefax. During the Second World War, they allowed their friend, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, to use the house as his country retreat, as it was hard to spot from the air. Later, Tree sold the house and estate to The 7th Earl of Wilton, who owned it briefly before selling in 1953 to Sir David Wills of the tobacco family, who set up the Ditchley Foundation, for the promotion of international relations. History Ditchley was a medieval village recorded between the 14th and 17th centuries. No trace of the deserted medieval village is now visible. Ditchley once provided lodging and access to the royal hunting ground of Wychwood Forest. In September 1603 James I dined with Sir Henry Lee at Ditchfield. The present house was erected in 1722 for The 2nd Earl of Lichfield and was designed by James Gibbs. Occupants of the Ditchley estate have included: * Sir Henry Lee, KG (March, 1533 ‚Äì 12 February 1611), of Ditchley He commissioned the Ditchley Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I, which shows her standing on a map of the British Isles, surveying her dominions; one foot rests near Ditchley in Oxfordshire, to commemorate her visit to Sir Henry Lee there. He was later noted for declining to receive his monarch a second time, because of the enormous expense. * Sir Henry Lee, 1st Bt., of Quarendon, later of Ditchley (died by 1632) ‚Äì heir and cousin of the previous * Sir Francis Henry Lee, 2nd Bt., of Quarendon (1616‚Äì1639) * Anne, Countess of Rochester, widow of Sir Francis Lee, born Anne Saint John * The 2nd Earl of Rochester was born there c. 1647 * Sir Henry Lee, 3rd Bt. (born ca. 1633; died 1659 * Sir Francis Henry Lee, 4th Baronet of Quarendon * Charlotte, Countess of Lichfield, illegitimate daughter of Charles II * The Viscounts Dillon =Tree family= In 1933, after the death of The 17th Viscount Dillon, an Anglo-Irish peer, Ditchley was bought by Anglo-American Ronald Tree and his wife, the celebrated decorator Nancy Lancaster. It was the decoration of Ditchley which earned Nancy the reputation of having \\"the finest taste of almost anyone in the world.\\" She worked on it with Sibyl Colefax (Mrs Bethell of Elden Ltd having died in 1932) and the French decorator St√©phane Boudin of the Paris firm Jansen. In November 1933, Ronald was elected MP for Harborough, Leicestershire. Tree and his wife Nancy were among those who saw the Nazi threat, and had invited Winston Churchill and his wife to dinner on numerous occasions from 1937. =Churchill= Churchill bust On the outbreak of war, the security forces were concerned by the visibility of both Churchill's country house, Chartwell ‚Äì its high site, and its position south of London, making it an easy returning-home target for German aircraft ‚Äì and the Prime Minister's official retreat of Chequers, which had an entrance road which was clearly visible from the sky when illuminated by moonlight. Churchill had use of the Paddock bunker in Neasden, but only used it on one occasion for a cabinet meeting before returning to his Cabinet War Room bunker in Whitehall. Ditchley, with its heavy foliage and lack of a visible access road, was an ideal site. Churchill asked Tree for \\"accommodation at Ditchley for certain weekends, when the moon is high\\" and he readily consented. Churchill first went to Ditchley in lieu of Chequers on 9 November 1940, accompanied by his wife Clementine and daughter Mary. During visits to Ditchley, Churchill negotiated part of the Lend-Lease agreement with President Roosevelt's special advisor Harry Hopkins, and had exiled Czechoslovakian President Edvard Bene≈° as a guest.Winston Churchill By late 1942, security at Chequers had been improved, including covering the road with turf. The last weekend Churchill attended Ditchley as his official residence was Tree's birthday on 26 September 1942, and his final visit was for lunch in 1943.History Lives at Ditchley and Bletchley ‚Äì The Churchill Centre In June 1994, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd unveiled a bronze bust of Churchill, which stands in a prominent position to highlight the role that Ditchley Park played during a critical phase of the Second World War. Recent decades Ditchley from the lake Shortly after the end of the war, Tree divorced Nancy and married Marietta Peabody Fitzgerald, an American woman he had met while working for the Ministry of Information. Marietta moved into Ditchley, but found English country life not to her liking. Noticing his wife's upset, and short of money, Tree sold Ditchley to Sir David Wills, descendant of the tobacco importing family, W. D. & H. O. Wills of Bristol; and moved with his family and butler Collins to New York. In 1958 Wills set up a trust called the Ditchley Foundation, which aims to promote international (especially Anglo- American) relations, and which still owns the house today. During filming of the 2009 feature film The Young Victoria, Ditchley was used to represent Buckingham Palace, in particular Victoria's sitting room. Ditchley is sometimes known as Ditchley Park or Ditchley House. It lies about 2 miles (3.2 km) northeast of Charlbury. Ditchley was used to film scenes from the first episode of the final series of Downton Abbey.http://www.ditchley.co.uk/news/post/162-downton-at-ditchley In 2002, it became the home of the Butler Valet School.http://www.butler- valetschool.co.uk/ Archaeology There are remains of a Roman villa on the Ditchley Park estate at Watts Wells, less than southeast of the house.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 576 It was a colonnaded house with outbuildings, threshing floors, and a granary with capacity for the produce of about of arable land.Emery, 1974, page 44 It was surrounded by a rectangular ditch by .Riley, 1943, page 87 The site is less than north of the course of Akeman Street Roman road, and is one of a number of Roman villas and Romano-British farmsteads that have been identified in the area,Emery, 1974, pages 41‚Äì45 apparently associated with the territory bounded by Grim's Ditch.Booth, 1999, pages 47‚Äì48 The villa site was identified by aerial archaeology in 1934 and excavated in 1935.Booth, 1999, page 41 It was found to have been first settled in about AD 70 with a set of timber-framed buildings, which were replaced in stone in the 2nd century. In about AD 200 a fire severely damaged the stone buildings and the site was abandoned. The site was reoccupied early in the 4th century, and occupation on a more modest scale than before continued until the end of that century. Some time before the villa was discovered and excavated, a hoard of 1,176 bronze Roman coins was found between Box Wood and Out Wood, about to northeast of the villa site.Sutherland, 1936, page 70 The coins range in date from about AD 270 onwards and seem to have been buried in a ceramic pot about AD 395, towards the end of the Roman occupation.Sutherland, 1936, page 71 The hoard was transferred to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford in 1935. Grim's Ditch, which passes through the present park and estate, is an ancient boundary believed to have been constructed during the Roman occupation of Britain in about the 1st century AD.Copeland, 1988, page 287 The toponym \\"Ditchley\\" is derived from a compound of two Old English words, meaning the woodland clearing (\\"-ley\\") on Grim's Ditch.

After retiring from boxing, he has gained popularity as an actor and comedian. As a boxer, he was known for his unpredictable style, sometimes marking completely unexpected victories, and often losing in extravagant fashion as well. He lost 14 of his 51 professional fights, a rather large number of losses for a world champion. He often appears as a foolish boke character on television, but this is an act he puts on for media purposes. As a boxing commentator, he offers precise, intelligent commentary based on his own experiences in the ring. He is also known to have a liking for bananas, and keeps numerous bananas lying around his home, should he suddenly develop a craving for one. His original ring name was Ishimatsu Suzuki, but was changed to Guts Ishimatsu, since he wanted himself to become a gutsy boxer. Earlier in his career, Guts had often given up in fights where he was losing. Boxing career Guts made his professional debut in 1966. He was known primarily as a rough, undisciplined fighter early in his career, but his technique improved greatly under the tutelage of American trainer Eddie Townsend. He challenged Panamanian Ismael Laguna in 1970 for the WBA/WBC Lightweight Title, but lost by TKO in the 13th round. He challenged Shinichi Kadota (who had knocked out Guts only five months earlier) in 1972, and won by decision to capture the OPBF Lightweight title. After the fight, he remarked that his goal was to fight the WBA/WBC champion Ken Buchanan. Buchanan would challenge Guts three years later, when Guts was the WBC Lightweight champion. In 1973, Guts challenged the legendary Roberto Dur√°n in Panama for the WBA Lightweight title. Guts fought hard, but was brutally knocked out in the 10th round. Guts' manager was infuriated by Guts' loser attitude, as Guts remarked that Dur√°n in his prime was \\"Too strong, I can't win\\", even before the fight had ended. On April 11, 1974, Guts fought WBC Champion Rodolfo Gato Gonz√°lez in Tokyo. Gonz√°lez had a record of 59-5-0 (50KOs) going into the fight, as opposed to Guts' rather pathetic record of 26-11-6 (14KOs). Few expected Guts to win, but Guts fought toe-to-toe with the champion, getting a knockout win in the 8th round. Guts credited his win with being able to prepare for three extra months (Gonz√°lez was bitten by a spider before the fight, moving the date back three months), which he used to pack on extra stamina for the fight. Guts was re-introduced to Gonz√°lez 32 years later on a Japanese television show, where he learned that he and Gonzalez bore an uncanny number of similarities, including being born in a poor household, and succeeding as an actor after retiring from boxing as former world champions. Guts made his first title defense in September, 1974, and beat Gonz√°lez again in November, 1974 for his second title defense. The next challenger was Scotsman Ken Buchanan, who was 56-2-0 (25KOs) and had not lost in the last three years. The fight was scheduled for February, 1975. Buchanan led the early and middle rounds by points, but Guts fought back in the later rounds, swinging his arms around almost blindly to slow Buchanan's pace. The fight ended lopsidedly, with Guts slugging Buchanan for the last three rounds. All three judges awarded Guts the win. Guts made his fourth defense in June, 1975, but he gradually realized that it was becoming harder and harder for him to maintain his weight in the Lightweight division. For his fifth defense in December, 1975, Guts had to lower his weight 19 kg from his natural weight, losing 10 kg in the month before the fight. Guts lost his title in May 1976 to Esteban De Jes√∫s by 15 round decision. The fight took place in Puerto Rico, and the country paid $200,000 (a rather large investment in the time period for a lightweight title match) to have Guts fight in Puerto Rico, showing Guts' widespread popularity at the time. Guts moved up to Junior Welterweight (current Super Lightweight/Light Welterweight) in 1977, challenging Saensak Muangsurin, but was knocked out in the 6th round. Despite having moved up a weight class, Guts still had to shed 15 kg off his natural weight to make the weight-in. Guts retired after losing again in a non-title match on June 20, 1978. His record was 31-14-6 (17KOs). Post retirement Guts had begun to appear on television shows even before his boxing career had ended. He appeared on a variety show for the first time in 1974, only the day after he had become the WBC lightweight world champion. Guts became indispensable to quiz shows and game shows, where he would make the meaningless answer \\"OK Boku-jo\\" (\\"OK Corral\\") regardless of what the trivia question was actually asking. However, in certain shows, he recorded rather high scores, surprising viewers with his intelligent side. \\"OK Boku-jo\\" became the word of the year in Japan (2004), and Ishimatsu released a single CD, as well as a book describing his experiences inside and outside the ring, which became a best-seller. \\"OK Boku-jo\\" and its other variations (such as \\"OK No-jo\\", which is meant to give a negative connotation) have become immensely popular (but still completely meaningless) in Japan. The Guts-Pose He is credited with coining the word \\"Guts-Pose\\", now commonly used in the Japanese language. The word comes from the peculiar pose he struck after winning fights, where he would pump his fist up and down in the air. He has explained that his right hand shows his own joy at winning the fight, and his left hand shows his gratitude to the crowd. Japanese pitchers are often seen striking this pose after finishing a game/inning, or striking out a batter. Acting Guts has appeared in several movies, both inside and outside Japan. Notables include Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun (1987) and Sir Ridley Scott's Black Rain (1989). He says the only reason he started acting was so that he could be on the screen with Ken Takakura, who was his childhood idol. He has also appeared in numerous TV dramas, and has occasionally attempted to write and direct movies of his own. Grave Guts has a large grave already built in the Satsuki Reien cemetery in Kanuma, Tochigi.

It was founded in November 1919 and completed in 1921. Etymology Seaplane hangars It was named after Captain James Ely Miller (1883‚Äì1918), commanding officer of the 95th Aero Squadron in the Air Service of the AEF, who died in combat on March 9, 1918 over Rheims in World War I. He was the first United States aviator killed in action while serving with an American military aviation unit. Before World War I Miller had been vice president of the Columbia Trust Company of New York and manager of its Fifth Avenue office who trained at his own expense to earn his pilot's license and Reserve Military Aviator rating with the Governors Island Training Corps in 1916. He was also an organizer, along with Major Raynal Bolling, of the 1st Reserve Aero Squadron, the first unit of what would eventually become the Air Force Reserve Command. Note: This includes See also: History When built in 1921, Miller Field was the only coastal defense air station in the eastern United States and was part of the network of fortifications around New York City. It was built on land formerly belonging to the Vanderbilt family. It had a grass runway (and was the last airport with a grass runway in New York City), ramps for seaplanes, and four hangars for planes. Miller Field was used for antiaircraft fire and training Coast Guard personnel. Miller Field closed as an airbase in 1969. The Field was the site of the Elm Tree Beacon Light, a lighthouse from the 19th century through 1924 when it was abandoned. The light had replaced a landmark elm tree. The Miller Army Air Field Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. =Accidents and incidents= On December 16, 1960, a United Airlines Douglas DC-8 and a Trans World Airlines Lockheed Super Constellation collided just west of the field with the Constellation crashing into the northwest corner of the airport while the DC-8 crashed into Park Slope, Brooklyn. 134 were killed. The disaster was the worst airline disaster to that point. Current use The field is in use as a local park, with baseball and soccer fields. It hosts the New York Philharmonic in the summer. The field is directly east of New Dorp High School. Miller Field is a part of the Staten Island Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area, which is managed by the National Park Service. MTA New York City Bus #4017 on the S76 route in New Dorp running along Miller Field.

(American Justice reports the box was found in April 1996. Series 126.) Melendez had been murdered by Alig and his roommate, Robert \\"Freeze\\" Riggs, his legs dismembered, and his upper body enclosed in a box they enjoined an unwitting taxi driver's help to transport and throw into the Hudson River, near Tunnel nightclub.

The zoo charges an entrance fee, which allows guests to walk around the zoo and view a selection of animals from around the world.. Animals The species on display include a common hippopotamus, lions, striped hyenas, California sea lions, zebras, scimitar horned oryx, a selection of bears, monkeys, Dromedary camels, Barbary sheep, black leopard, spotted hyena, golden jackal, Bactrian camel, and llama. Exhibits The zoo also includes a reptile house and a 'birds and small mammals' section, as well as a museum. The reptile house is home to several endemic Egyptian species, including the Egyptian cobra, the Nile crocodile and the critically endangered Egyptian tortoise. Several aviaries are home to hawks, eagles, falcons, African crested porcupines and Egyptian mongooses. Animal welfare By the early 2000s the zoo was in disrepair from neglect. Animal Aid Egypt, along with a group of volunteers, started helping improve the animals' living conditions. They talked zoo authorities into freeing the zoo's elephant from chains during the day, to roam freely, as well as building her some shade and reinforcing her night quarters. They worked with keepers to improve the chimp's diet and added enrichment to their outside enclosures, and are trying to get wooden floors installed in their night enclosures. In February 2015, two men entered Alexandria Zoo and beat up hamadryas baboons with sticks as dozens of zoo- goers watched and laughed. Most of the monkeys fled to the top of the enclosure for safety. Several others endured beating by the men as people in the crowd shouted, laughed and clapped. The two men spent a considerable amount of time in the monkey enclosure and no security at the zoo intervened. Eventually, the men left the scene un-apprehended and without suffering any consequences.\\"Thugs Beat Up Monkeys, Steal Their Bananas At Alexandria Zoo\\", Egyptian Streets, February 7, 2015.\\"Attackers beat up monkeys in Alexandria Zoo\\", Cairoscene, 08/02/2015.

Born in Wolverhampton, at his father's boarding house in Broad Street which later became his bike shop,The Guardian, August 15 2001, William Fotheringham Stallard became a member of the Wolverhampton Wheelers Cycling club and a keen competitor in cycle races, competing for Great Britain in international races during the 1930s, including three consecutive world championships (1933‚Äì1935).Wolverhampton Local History He was also a successful cycling coach and team captain. Racing career Percy Stallard joined Wolverhampton Wheelers and rode his first race on 8 May 1927, when he was 17.Stallard's papers, University of Warwick, Coventry (www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/archives) The competition was a 10-mile individual time trial on a course described as \\"the Cannock road\\". By the end of the season he progressed to riding 50-mile (80 km) events and the following year to a 12-hour endurance race He rode only time-trials until 1932, when his papers suggest he may have ridden in local grass-track meetings or perhaps on a hard velodrome. He could also have tried cyclo-cross because that year he also took part in a race between cyclists and runners, traditionally held on cross-country courses. Track races became more common from 1933. =Brooklands and the world championship= Lone racing against the clock was a British speciality and in 1932 Frank Southall came sixth in the Olympic Games cycling road race in Los Angeles when it was run that way. But then came an announcement that henceforth the Olympics would be run as a massed-start event, a form of racing which (see below) the British cycling authorities had banned since the 19th century and at which British riders therefore had no experience. The magazine Cycling wrote: > \\"The strongest possible protest ought to be made by the English delegates > both to the UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale) and the Olympic committees > against the recent decision by the UCI that the Olympic road-race for 1936 > is to be a massed-start affair. The Olympic Games were the last stronghold > of the genuine international trial of road-riding, free from tactics or > bunching.\\"Bunching\\" was the term for riders sitting in the slipstream of > others while riding in a bunch or pack of riders. British opinion held that > it distorted the race because riders fresh from never having taken the lead > could sprint by at the finish.Woodland, Les (2005) This Island Race, > Mousehold Press, UK Confronted by a decision it could not get reversed, the British governing body, the National Cyclists' Union (NCU), allowed the Charlotteville Cycling Club in Guildford, Surrey, to organise a series of races on the Brooklands car circuit. The largest, on 17 June 1933, was billed as the 100-Kilometre Massed- Start World Cycling Championship Trial and the NCU said it would choose its next team for the world championship based on the outcome. The organiser was Vic Jenner and the business manager Bill Mills, two international riders. Mills went on to start the weekly magazine The Bicycle as a rival to Cycling. A crowd put at 10,000 watched a \\"race like kick-and-rush football, tactics limited to random and eccentric attacking by the best, hanging on for the rest.\\" Stallard recalled: Stallard was chosen for the 1933 UCI Road World Championships team and finished 11th, the best of the British entry. The British favourite had been Frank Southall, but although his speed got him into the group of 38 leading riders, his inability to change pace on the shallow rises of the Autodrome de Linas-Montlh√©ry near Montlh√©ry, gave him difficulties. The writer and race organiser, Chas Messenger, wrote: Southall eventually abandoned and the other rider, Jack Salt, who had won at Brooklands, came 21st and last. Stallard and the team created interest in France. Stallard said: \\"The trip to France was a real education to me, and during my short stay I learnt more about bike racing than I had done during my six years as a time-triallist. I went equipped with a 20-inch 'contraption' that may well have been the latest design 20 years earlier, but certainly not later. My handlebars were really the things that fascinated most. They were a lovely pair of 19¬Ω-inch Highgates, and when referring to the antediluvian equipment of the English team, the French Press likened my bars to a pair of 'cow's horns.'\\"The Bicycle, UK, 6 February 1948, p8 Next year, in the 1934 UCI Road World Championships at Leipzig, Stallard was selected to ride with Charles Holland and Fred Ghilks. Their accompanying official from the National Cyclists' Union was from Herne Hill velodrome in south London and knew little of road-racing. The circuit was nearly six miles round, to be covered 12 times. The marshalling was by Brownshirts. The race averaged 26 mph with one lap at nearly 30. Holland rode 60 of the 70 miles with three broken spokes and came fourth. Stallard and Ghilks finished over two minutes later, Stallard seventh and Ghilks 26th. The race was won by Kees Pellenaars of the Netherlands, who went on to manage the Dutch team in the Tour de France. =First road race= Stallard had never ridden a massed event on the open road in Britain. The English cycle-racing authorities had, since the end of the 19th century, banned racing on the roads, fearing the police would ban all cycling as a result. The National Cyclists' Union, the governing body, demanded races be held only on tracks and, later, on circuits such as airfields that were closed to traffic. Although time trials (races between individuals competing against the clock) had started as a revolt against the NCU's ban ‚Äì the races were held at dawn on courses kept secret from the public with riders dressed from head to toe in black to complete the secrecy ‚Äì there were no races on open roads between riders starting together. In June 1936, though, the Isle of Man allowed a race over one lap of the motorcycling Snaefell mountain course. The island is a separate jurisdiction from the United Kingdom and did not fall under British police control. The island also saw the race as a potential tourist attraction. In time the race, expanded to three laps and known as the Manx International, became the main event within a week of cycling festivities that followed the motorcycling week. The 1936 race was spectacular for the crashes that it produced, because for the first time riders were required to negotiate everyday winding streets rather than the smooth bends of a motor-racing course. Stallard finished 17th and inspired by what he had ridden. There were more races on car circuits and airfields ‚Äì Stallard won the last race at Brooklands, in 1939 ‚Äì but to Stallard they were just a shadow of the real thing. Campaign for road racing When war came later that year, the roads emptied because of petrol rationing. Stallard insisted that if there were few or no other road-users, massed racing on the road was unlikely to bring objections. He wrote in December 1941 to A. P. Chamberlin of the NCU: Chamberlin was not impressed. Stallard protested that the airfields and car circuits which were the only place that the NCU would allow massed racing had been taken by the army and RAF. On Easter Monday 1942 he called a meeting at the foot of Long Mynd, a hill in Shropshire that was popular with cyclists, and announced his plan for a 59-mile race from Llangollen to Wolverhampton on 7 June. He obtained sponsorship from the Wolverhampton Express and Star newspaper, offered any profits to the newspaper's Forces Comfort Fund, and recruited 40 riders to take part. =Opposition and suspension= His plan brought strong opposition from the cycling establishment, particularly from the veteran administrator and writer George Herbert Stancer. His fear, and that of the NCU, was that asking the police for permission to hold a race ended the freedom of cyclists to hold races, or at any rate lone races against the clock, without interference. Under the headline A hopeless revolt, George Herbert Stancer wrote: > \\"They have plunged into their dangerous experiment without regard for the > consequences... I understand that the 'rebels' want to go on holding races > by police permit and under police protection; and when this is withdrawn > they are apparently content to put up the shutters and go out of business as > promoters.... If we voluntarily place road-racing under police control, we > sign its death warrant.... If we are to race on the road, for heaven's sake > let us do it as free citizens, and not by permission of the police.\\" Stancer's words influenced the NCU and it banned Stallard before the race had started. An agreement with the Road Time Trials Council meant that it too banned him. Stallard argued later that the race was not against the NCU's rules, which said: \\"Massed start races will be permitted only under the most exceptional circumstances, e.g. if the police and/or other authorities either close the roads or give in writing their official approval of the race being run.\\"Cited The Bicycle, UK, 3 June 1942, p6 The police, he said, had approved his race and would help on the day. The NCU, on the other hand, pointed out that Stallard's letters to chief constables had referred not to a massed-start race but to a \\"cycling event.\\"The Bicycle, UK, 20 May 1942, p6 Stallard went ahead with the event on 7 June 1942 and it finished, without incident, in front of a crowd at West Park. Cycling reported: > \\"More than a thousand people watched the finish of the massed-start race > organised by Percy Stalland, from Llangollen to Wolverhampton, on Sunday > afternoon. The Chief Constable of Wolverhampton, an inspector, a sergeant > and 15 uniformed policemen kept the crowd back. Police cars and police > motorcyclists patrolled portions of the course. A police motorcyclist led > the racing men through the streets to the finish. E. A. Price, of > Wolverhampton, won the sprint from his clubmate, C. J. Anslow\\" The report ‚Äì in which the frequent mention of the police reflected the magazine's concerns as expressed by Stancer ‚Äì went on to explain that the race had been banned by the NCU and by the time-trialling body, the Road Time Trials Council, but that there had been no incidents other than a lorry backing on to the course. Fifteen riders finished and all those involved in the race were suspended by the NCU.The Bicycle, UK, 17 June 1942, p25 Stallard was banned indefinitelyThe Bicycle, UK, 20 May 1942, p4 for refusing to account for himself to the NCU's management. The suspension, often referred to as \\"for life\\" was in fact sine die, meaning without defined end but allowing Stallard to appeal. The weekly magazine, The Bicycle, apologised to the NCU on 20 May 1942 for misreporting the penalty as a life suspension, although the consequence proved the same because Stallard did not appeal and the ban was never lifted. British League of Racing Cyclists With nowhere to go but insistent that massed racing was the future, Stallard was instrumental in creating a breakaway organisation, the British League of Racing Cyclists. It was formed in November that year, bringing together regional groups already forming in the Midlands and the North. Stallard won the 1944 BLRC championship,Percy Stallard Collection and served as events organiser for a time, before being expelled for criticising the standard of events. He was also a moving force behind organisation of the fledgling Tour of Britain. Stallard remained bitter about the NCU and even his own invention, the BLRC, for the rest of his life. His criticism of the BLRC and its standards of race organisation led to his being briefly suspended from the organisation he had helped to found. In 1959, the NCU and the BLRC agreed to merge, by which time both had become mentally and financially exhausted by their civil war. Stallard saw the merger as treason by \\"just three people [who] were allowed the freedom to destroy the BLRC\\" and until his death saw the new British Cycling Federation (BCF) as a reincarnation of the NCU. His assistant at his cycle shop, Ralph Jones, was the BLRC delegate at an international meeting in Spain which recognised the BCF as Britain's national body. Stallard sacked him the next day he came into work. Jones had finished sixth in Stallard's race from Llangollen to Wolverhampton.The Bicycle, UK, 10 June 1942, p23 =London- Holyhead= Percy Stallard believed not only that Britain could have racing and a race like the Tour de France but he was inspired by the distance of events such as Bordeaux‚ÄìParis and on Saturday 9 June 1951 organised a race from London to Holyhead. It started from Marble Arch at 5 am and finished 267 miles later in Holyhead.\\"The first London to Holyhead Cycle Race\\", race programme 1951 Thirty-five riders were listed at the start, all professionals or semi-professionals (known as independents ‚Äì the BLRC, contrary to the other cycling bodies in Britain, had promoted the idea of independent riders, who were intended to be trying their hand in professional racing while not yet committing themselves to leaving the amateur class). The BLRC official and historian Chas Messenger wrote: > Twenty-eight started out of the 35 listed at the crack of dawn from Marble > Arch, sent on their way by Lord Donegal, who was later to become president > of the League [BLRC]. In a sea of mist, they wafted up the Edgware Road and > on the other side of Dunstable came the first attack which split the field > in three...\\" At the finish at Holyhead: > \\"No quarter asked, no quarter given as they tore on to the Promenade... > [Les] Scales sprinted 'like the clappers' and took the race by two lengths > from [Geoff] Clark and [Fred] Nicholls at a length. Bravo Percy!\\" The race continued until the 1960s, organised by Stan Kite, until it fell foul of traffic on the main A5 road ‚Äì riders sometimes had to stop at traffic lightsSimpson, Tom (1966) Cycling is My Life, pub. Stanley Paul, UK ‚Äì and international limits on race distances. League of Veteran Racing Cyclists Stallard rode his last race when he was 56, in Doncaster. Racing as he grew older became difficult because the British Cycling Federation's rules classed all riders as veterans when they passed 40. Stallard argued that veterans' races should be organised in age-groups and he clashed again with cycling authorities by forming an organisation to make that possible. He drew up the rules from a hospital bed in 1985, when he was having a hip replaced, and the League of Veteran Racing Cyclists (LVRC) began in 1986. This time, the rest of cycling left him to it. Stallard fell out with the organisation he had founded, saying in his private papers that the LVRC was not \\"up to expectation\\" and adding: In June 1989 he wrote to the journalist Les Woodland: \\"I regret very much my endeavour on behalf of age-related [racing]. While there is a definite call for this type of riding, a big majority of the LVRC membership look upon the organisation as a means of providing them with a few extra races, nothing more, and have no allegiance to it whatever.\\" Refusal of honour In 1988, the BCF offered Stallard its gold medal for services to the sport. The magazine Cycling wrote: \\"Are we being over-optimistic in believing that the bitterness caused by the rift of the Forties and Fifties has now faded away?\\"Cycling, 24 March 1988 Cycling was indeed being overoptimistic: Stallard refused the medal. Cycling reported: > \\"His initial response was favourable, but now he has written to federation > secretary Len Unwin, declining the nomination and an invitation to the > annual dinner in December. He [Stallard] wrote: 'Whatever the award is > intended for, whether it is my activities of 48 years ago, or my present > struggle on behalf of age-related racing, the significance of the award is > nil as it does not open the locked doors of the BCF to me or to anyone else > with progressive ideas.'\\" Stallard believed that he had never been asked to manage a British team or take a national position in the sport because former NCU officials ran the BCF and resented what he had done. Just before his death on 11 August 2001, Stallard wrote: Later life Stallard continued cycling into his eighties. In 1965, he rode alone over the Theodul Pass between Zermatt in Switzerland and Italy. The Rough Stuff Fellowship, an organisation for enthusiasts of cross-country cycling, acknowledged that it was probably the first time a cyclist had done it. The pass is 10,976 feet high and Stallard made it in less than 15 hours, sometimes through deep snow. He also walked over Mount Whitney, at 14,496 feet, in the US, but came close to dying after running out of water while walking down into the Grand Canyon and back out again along mule tracks. He also crossed the Sierra Nevada in four days of 1973.Private papers He travelled 25,000 miles across America by Greyhound bus and organised more than 100 coach trips for fellow walking enthusiasts. His life ended riddled with regret. He wrote: He died leaving three children, Mick, Yvonne and Olwyn. He divorced in the 1960s. His brothern Dennis, lived in Perth, Western Australia.http://roadcyclinguk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=106592&page;=1 Personality The journalist William Fotheringham remembered: \\"He never lost his cantankerousness or gained any respect for authority. While walking up Scafell Pike one day, he and his group were told by a warden to turn back due to thick mist; the group returned, and later met Stallard at the bus, only to be told, 'I came to climb the bloody mountain, so I went to the top.'\\" Percy Stallard was a bright and energetic man with a vision for his sport. But he was not a man to tolerate argument or those with other views. Having achieved what he wanted, with the NCU's final acceptance of massed racing on the road, Stallard placed the continuity of the BLRC over the end of the civil war that the BLRC and the NCU had conducted. Critics said Stallard had lost sight of the intention of the BLRC, which had been to bring racing to the open road and that, once achieved, there was no further point in rival cycling administrations. Peter Bryan, editor of The Bicycle, associate of Sporting Cyclist and managing editor of Cycling, said: > \\"The BLRC was originally a gang of enthusiasts. Then along came what I'd > call the parliamentarians of pedal power, men who saw a runaway organisation > and decided they'd take it over.\\" Stallard was influenced by those who > agreed with him but in the end he and others became too much for the BLRC's > other administrators and the BLRC magazine, The Leaguer, reported in 1954: > \\"There is a malignant ulcer prevalent in the cycling world common to all > three racing bodies in this country. It is the taint of vanity and > culminates in the clash of personality.\\" Inheritance Stallard's actions cast British cycling into a civil war that lasted longer than World War II. They created a division in the sport that outlasted the foundation of the British Cycling Federation and they established an organisation, the BLRC, which is still fondly remembered by the few cyclists old enough to have competed with it. Stallard reintroduced massed racing to British roads for the first time since the 19th century. To the question of whether Britain would have moved to massed racing anyway, without the BLRC, Peter Bryan says not, saying that the established cycling authorities had become entrenched in their positions, their own rivalry overshadowed by their joint fears and interests. > \\"The NCU and the RTTC were never friends. The RTTC were particular bastards > and they had so many clever men in the top echelon, many more than the NCU. > They were steeped in the tradition of time-trialling and what it stood for > and they wouldn't budge a jot or tickle.\\" Stallard's success was that he alerted the UCI to a problem in British cycling which led the UCI to threaten Britain with exclusion from world cycling unless it sorted out the conflict between the NCU and the BLRC. Seeing the BLRC as closer to the UCI's interests, it suggested it would recognise the BLRC and not the NCU as the representative body. It was because of that that the NCU relented and agreed to license the massed races it had hitherto opposed. The League of Veteran Racing Cyclists (LVRC) holds a competition named in Stallard's memory.

The buff-tailed sicklebill (Eutoxeres condamini) is a species of hermit hummingbird from the lower Andes and adjacent west Amazonian lowlands from southern Colombia and northern Ecuador to Peru and Bolivia.Hinkelmann (1999) Description With a total length of 5‚Äì6 in (13‚Äì15 cm) and weighing 0.28-0.44 oz (8-12.5 g), it is a relatively large hummingbird. Males and females are virtually identical, differing only in size (especially wing measurements), with the females being some 20% smaller. Its upperparts are iridescent dull greenish, while the underparts are whitish, densely streaked with dusky. The neck-side has a relatively faint blue patch. The tips of the rectrices (tail feathers) are white, and there is a naked stripe on top of the head (but this is usually concealed). The most conspicuous features, however, are those the common name refers to: the bill is strongly decurved, and the outer three rectrices on each side are deep buff, best visible from below. Immature birds have light-tipped remiges (pinions), hardly any blue on the neck, and lack the naked crown stripe. Hatchlings have black skin and grey down. There are two subspecies which are not very distinct and almost form a continuous cline, with an extensive intergradation zone in northern Peru: * Eutoxeres condamini condamini (Bourcier, 1851) - northern buff-tailed sicklebill :Colombia and Ecuador. Bill longer, lower belly much streaked * Eutoxeres condamini gracilis Berlepsch & Stolzmann, 1902 - southern buff-tailed sicklebill :Central Peru to Bolivia. Bill shorter, lower belly less streaked The buff outer remiges are the most reliable trait for separating the buff-tailed sicklebill from the only other member of the genus Eutoxeres, the white-tipped sicklebill (E. aquila), which has a more northerly distribution. The Eutoxeres species are somewhat sympatric however, for example in the foothills of Putumayo around Mocoa, Colombia.Hinkelmann (1999), Salaman et al. (2002) Ecology It is restricted to the undergrowth of humid forested and wooded habitats, recorded from 590‚Äì10,800 ft (180-3,300 m) ASL. It will tolerate more habitat disturbance than its congener, regularly occurring in plantations, bamboo stands and open habitat where populations are healthy, though it still prefers natural vegetation. Nothing precise is known about its movements, though it is presumed that the birds are non-migratory. The peculiar bill is an adaption to the shape of certain flowers, namely of the genera Centropogon and Heliconia. It feeds mainly by trap-lining. In addition to nectar, it will also catch small arthropods.Hinkelmann (1999), Greeney & Gelis (2007) The two white eggs are laid in a nest which is attached to the underside of a leaf, a few yards/meters above ground. In the southern Cordillera Oriental of Colombia, nest construction was observed in July or August, and in the lowlands of Ecuador's Napo Province in January. Birds with enlarged gonads were found in Peru from September to November. Only the female incubates; the incubation period is 16‚Äì18 days and the young fledge 22‚Äì24 days after hatching. They start to breed when they are 1‚Äì2 years old.Hinkelmann (1999), Salaman et al. (2002), Greeney & Gelis (2007) Generally fairly common though inconspicuous and easily overlooked, it is considered a species of Least Concern by the IUCN. This species is most easily seen in the mixed habitat of old and young forest and small-scale logging at the Napo River in eastern Ecuador.Hinkelmann (1999), BLI (2009) Footnotes References * * Hinkelmannn, Christoph (1999): 3.

A leading figure of pre-World War II Flemish nationalism, he co-founded the extreme-right group Verdinaso. Van Severen delivering a speech Early years Van Severen was born in the Flemish town of Wakken as Georges Edmond Eduard Van Severen. His family was Flemish but, in keeping with a number of leading Flemings, spoke the French language and as such were given the derogatory nickname Fransquillon by Dutch speakers. Van Severen's father was a prominent lawyer who also served as mayor of Wakken. Van Severen was educated by Jesuits in the Sint-Barbaracollege, who taught in French, before studying law at the University of Ghent. Following the outbreak of the First World War Van Severen was called up to the Belgian Army. Initially a sergeant, he was promoted to second lieutenant in January 1917. While in the army Van Severen became part of the Front Beweging, a secret Flemish nationalist group active within the Belgian Army, and also wrote an open letter to King Albert calling for greater autonomy for Flanders.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1991, p. 401 The latter, which was the work of Van Severen and other intellectual soldiers such as Corporal Adiel de Beuckelaere, included calls for internal self-government and a separate Flemish Army.F.L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, London: Methuen & Co, 1974, p. 207 When this was discovered Van Severen was interrogated by Military Police about his Flemish nationalist activities and after informing them that he was supported the terms of the letter he was sentenced to eight days of house arrest.De Bruyne, A., Joris Van Severen, Droom & Daad, Oranje Uitgaven, 1961 His ultimate punishment was to be demoted back into the ranks in June 1918. Political development Already involved in the Flemish Movement, Van Severen began to develop his own wider ideology and world view. Towards the end of the war he became a convinced Russophile and reacted positively towards the Russian Revolution. He combined this with a strong Germanophobia, dismissing Germany as \\"a gang of bandits with no soul\\". Alongside this he had a strong faith in the Roman Catholic Church, and in particular admired the Catholic authors L√©on Bloy and Albrecht Rodenbach, who was also an important figure of inspiration for the Flemish Movement.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, pp. 401-402 His ideas began to take shape in the journal Ons Vaterland, which Van Severen and other like-minded soldiers produced from the front.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 402 Demobilised after the war, Van Severen returned to his studies at Ghent University, where he was chosen as president of the General Flemish Student Union. In 1921 he became editor of the journal Ter Waarheid and in this role his ideological outlook developed further as he shifted to the right. Although he had always been a nationalist Van Severen had held some respect for international socialism but by the early 1920s had abandoned this position in favour of a harder-edged nationalist Jacobinism. Frontpartij The only major political outlet for Flemish nationalism after the First World War was the Frontpartij and Van Severen duly joined this group. A candidate for the Roeselare-Tielt seat in the 1921 general election he was successful in gaining election to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives that year. As a member of the Chamber he supported a policy of \\"flemicization\\", encouraging the appointment of Flemings to leading roles in the judiciary, government, armed forces and other public institutions. As a parliamentarian he gained a reputation as a fiery and committed polemicist, although equally he was wont to lose interest and simply read passages from Charles P√©guy in the Chamber instead of making speeches. His shift to the right continued apace as his most admired political philosophers became Maurice Barr√®s and Charles Maurras. Van Severen lost his seat in the 1929 general election and, by then publicly expressing admiration for Benito Mussolini and Italian fascism, he established his own journal, Jong Dietschland. In this he argued for the establishment of an independent 'Greater Netherlands' in which Dutch people, Flemings, Frisians and Luxembourgers would unite in a new \\"Dietsch\\" state. Although his plan proved popular amongst the students at Ghent, with whom he still held strong influence, the bulk of the Frontpartij membership, who were mainly war veterans, did not embrace the plan and the party's official newspaper De Schelde decried fascism.Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, p. 208 Verdinaso With his plans having been rejected by the Frontpartij in October 1931 he broke away from that group to establish his own party, Verdinaso. Containing only 169 members on its foundation, the party was committed to a form of corporatism that Van Severen called national-solidarism as well as to integral nationalism. At its foundation it actually supported Flemish separatism but before long the group, which was far right, supported the Dietsch option.Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, p. 208-9 Van Severen advocated the use of force to take over the existing Belgium and then to establish the Greater Belgium state that he supported. He also advocated anti-parliamentarism, something that had been strengthened by his defeat in 1929, during which he felt moderates in the Frontpartij had deliberately sabotaged his re-election. His vision would eventually expand to that of the Dietsche Rijk which, rather than splitting Flanders off from Belgium in order to form the new state, advocated the effective union of the Benelux countries into a single entity.Hans Rogger & Eugen Weber, The European Right: A Historical Profile, University of California Press, 1965, pp. 151-152 The change was brought about in part by Van Severen \\"discovering\\" in 1934 that the Walloons, like the Flemings, were descended from the Franks.Christopher Ailsby, SS: Hell on the Eastern Front: The Waffen-SS War in Russia 1941-45, Zenith Imprint,, 1998, p. 88 In order to get his ideas off the ground Van Severen attempted to come to agreements with other far right movements, notably Rex and the Flemish National Union, but he was not successful in these endeavours. His own movement adopted many of the trappings of other European fascist movements, such as the political uniform, Roman salute, F√ºhrerprinzip and storm troopers (initially called Dinaso Militie before a 1934 name change to Dinaso Militanten Order), although Van Severen was unenthusiastic about the development of fascism, preferring to look back to the more conservative far right ideology of Action Fran√ßaise. He was particular unimpressed by Nazism, with Bertrand de Jouvenel quoting Van Severen as saying \\"I detest the Hitlerians\\". Death Following the outbreak of the Second World War Van Severen issued an order proscribing the production of any pro-Nazi literature by members of Verdinaso. Nevertheless, on 9 May 1940, immediately prior to Fall Gelb, Van Severen was one of a number of far right and far left activists arrested. The arrested men were put under the care of the French Army and stationed near Abbeville. On 20 May, when the advancing German Army cut off the area, a group of French soldiers carried out a massacre and killed a number of members of Verdinaso, Rex and the Belgian Communist Party, among them Van Severen. Twenty one suspects of varying political stripe were selected and executed without trial. With Van Severen dead, Verdinaso fell apart, with some activists falling into collaboration with the German occupation forces and others following his non-Nazi example by joining the resistance.Rogger & Weber, The European Right, p. 152  References  Category:1894 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Belgian military personnel of World War I Category:Flemish politicians Category:Belgian fascists Category:Belgian anti-communists Category:Executed politicians Category:Ghent University alumni Category:Belgian Roman Catholics Category:People from West Flanders Category:Executed Belgian people Category:People executed by France by firearm ","title":"Joris Van Severen"},{"id":"10706390","text":"Bel√©n is a town and municipality in the Nari√±o Department, Colombia.

It has a life cycle of approximately 70 days, and the sibling larvae show a synchronized development. The larvae can reach one inch in length, and the adult fly is about 0.8 inch (20 mm). The larvae groups are usually originated from the same female posture and spin a communal cocoon where the metamorphosis will occur. The fly is scientifically notable for the physiology of its polytene chromosomes and developmentally regulated amplified puffs, first observed by Crodowaldo Pavan. Its ecology is poorly understood, but it is assumed to be a fungus gnat. Until recently, scientists had no success in the laboratory breeding of this fly. Polytene chromosome Entomologist Christian Rudolph Wilhelm Wiedemann first described and classified this species in his work Diptera Exotica (1821). He had analyzed Brazilian specimens probably sent to him by colleagues or enthusiasts. European entomologists had difficulty visiting Brazil to collect samples for political reasons at the time. In 1950, during an expedition to collect wild Drosophilidae in the shore, in S√£o Paulo state on the southeast Brazilian coast Crodowaldo Pavan rediscovered the species and named it Rhynchosciara angelae. In 1951 the first publication on this ‚Äúnew‚Äù dipteran describes its morphological aspects and some habits. The synonymy was demonstrated in 1969 by Martha Breuer, and R. angelae was corrected to R. americana. Since the early observations the giant polytene chromosomes and its puffs were noticed in several larval tissues. Similar chromosomal structures were described in Chironomus by Balbiani, and became known as \\"Balbiani Rings\\", but the incorporation of radioactive thymidine experiments in the chromosomes of Rhynchosciara americana led to the discovery of two types of puff: a transcription-related puff, where the chromatin expands and the transcription events takes place; and an amplification-related one, where the chromatin expands and RNA transcription and DNA replication occur. In fact it was the first biological model where disproportionate DNA replication was detected. Nowadays the amplification phenomena is well-documented in several organisms, as Drosophila melanogaster, but is not totally understood. In Drosophila control elements as enhancers and replication origins were described and related to amplification phenomena, however in the Sciaridaes the puzzle is still far from solved.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The church contains the oldest wooden pulpit in England and a late 12th-century Norman font. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Chadkirk, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield, and the diocese of Chester. History The first stone building was probably erected in the early 14th century. In 1783 the walls were partly rebuilt and galleries were constructed on the south and east walls. At this time the church could seat 700 people. In 1815 a new entrance and porch were built and the south wall was repaired. In 1827-29 the chancel and the north wall were reconstructed to designs by the antiquarian Thomas Rickman.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840 3rd ed. (Yale University Press) 1995, s.v. \\"Thomas Rickman\\". In 1885 the east gallery was removed. In the first decade of the 20th century the south and west galleries were demolished. In 1960, a death watch beetle was found in the roof and the roof was replaced. The screen was moved from the front of the nave to its present position at the rear creating a new chapel at the west end. A new Mander organ was installed in 1977. The tower dates from the 15th century, it was built on 12th-century foundations, and the rest of the church dates from its rebuilding in the early 19th century. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in stone. Its plan consists of a west tower, a four-bay nave, a one-bay chancel and a south porch. At the east end is a pointed-arch window. The tower is in three stages and has a west door and window, two-light bell openings above which are clock faces, and a castellated parapet with finials. =Interior= Two important items of furniture in the church are the 14th-century pulpit and the Norman font. The pulpit is unique in England. Richards states it is the oldest wooden pulpit in England, and possibly in the world. It dates from the time of Edward II. It is octagonal in shape, with two of the sides forming the entrance. Five of the other six panels are carved with tracery. It is carved out of one block of wood. The font dates from the 11th century; it is not certain whether it was constructed before or after the Norman conquest. It is round and plain apart from the bowl which is carved with an incised design of figures and animals. The basin, which is lined with lead. The parish registers begin in 1629. External features In the churchyard are the remains of an Anglo-Saxon cross and a pair of stone shafts of stocks dating probably from the 19th century.

Ashurov owned several caf√©s and tea houses and paid for free meals in schools and for senior citizens. Many believed members of the Kulyabi clan had killed Ashurov, prompting demonstrations throughout the Khujand region; at least 20,000 in Khujand and hundreds in Istaravshan, Kanibadam, Isfara, and Shakhristan, demanding the arrest of those who killed Ashurov, up-to-date information as the case progressed, and the firing of Kulyabi officials in the regional government. Protestors later asked for the press to report on the demonstrations on television, control of humanitarian aid, and the designation of Khujand as a free economic zone. The protests went on for ten days with people in Khujand camping out at night. People held signs saying \\"Down with Emomali Rakhmonov!\\" and \\"Uninvited guests go away!\\" Police arrested Ikrom Ashurov, Akhmajon's brother, on charges of \\"banditry\\" and extortion after he participated in the protests. Local and national government officials negotiated in the city government building surrounded by police officers, members of the Interior Ministry, and the Presidential Guard. Conditions Prisoners initially demanded medical care and trials for those awaiting sentencing. They complained about unfair sentencing and wanted improved living conditions. At the time of the riot there were between 800 and 1,000 prisoners in the prison; twice the maximum number of prisoners allowed. In June 1996 the International Committee of the Red Cross began distributing food in an emergency program after starvation, malnutrition, and a lack of medical care led to the deaths of many prisoners. The ICRC and the government both said the prison's conditions were no worse than any other prison in Tajikistan. The Chairman of the Leninabad Regional Executive said that for stealing two bags of flour someone is sentenced to eight years imprisonment, whereas drug traffickers are sentenced to two years imprisonment. One prisoner, a seventeen-year-old who later died during the riot, had stolen a book from Isfara city library. The court sentenced him to seven years in prison.

Historical review After the earthquake of 1923, Cumbal is a population in two times: the old and the new, that of the brief one hung from the hill and the one that extends promisingly in the Plain of stones. According to different historical versions, Cumbal was founded in 1529 by the Cacique CUMBE \\"phoneme that refers to the fact that the name of Cumbal is of Mayan origin, since its name comes from the name of the indigenous priest CHILLAN CAMBAL from the Yucatan Peninsula\\" . Another version indicates that the old town of the Llano de Piedras, also originally called ‚ÄúPAVOS‚Äù, had its name changed to CUMBA in 1547. After 1923, the illustrious Mr. Antonio Mar√≠a Pueyo de Val named it CUMBAL DE LAS MERCEDES. \\"Cumba\\" is the Quichua word that means loophole, that is, it swallows light or a small opening on the roof of the peasant houses mainly intended to dislodge the smoke from the interior. Appropriate name for the town located at the foot of the volcano. Around 1713, as a curious pictorial document testifies, the old town of Cumbal consisted only of nine straw houses built around a chapel of the same characteristics; Another version affirms that \\"... the Mercedarians, in the mid-16th century, better said by the years 1561 to 1566, evangelized the Pasture Indians and taking advantage of them for civilian life founded the towns that since then were called Guachucal, Muellamu√©s, Cumbal , Colimba, Yascual ‚Äù. According to UHLE, Max in his study on the Carchi and Imbabura civilizations, National Typographical Workshops Quito, 1933 in relation to Cumbal says: The first town was located under the quarry in several Resguardos that now belong to the Cuaical Section. In 1907, Fray Ram√≥n Espa√±a de Segovia, parish priest of Cumbal, transferred the town of La Cantera to the Hill of the Old Town, in the place called ‚ÄúGuamucos‚Äù and Bishop Antonio Maria Pueyo de Val blessed and solemnly placed it, eight days after the disaster of 1923 the first stones of the Church and the Municipal House.

He was a member of the Russian provisional government as a minister of food supplies for some months in the summer of 1917.  Life  Peshekhonov was a self- educated social activist. Enrolled early in a Tver seminary for priests, he was expelled for political activity at age 17 (in 1884), and seems to have had no further formal training. He was strongly influenced by the narodnik philosopher N.K. Mikhailovsky. After military service 1888 to 1891, he worked first as a village teacher and later as a statistician for the Tver and Orla zemstvo councils, then the Kaluga province zemstvo administration where he became head of the statistical service (1896-1898). During this period he published noted studies on rural life that earned him entry into employment as a journalist in St. Petersburg (1899). He was also during this period several times arrested for his political activities, imprisoned or banished from his place of residence. Around the turn of the century, in addition to his journalism, Peshekhonov became increasingly active in the left-liberal political world - i.e., he was co-founder in 1903 of a \\"Union for Liberation\\" (Soiuz osvobozhdeniia). He was also briefly a member of the Socialist- Revolutionary Party but objected to its use of terror. In 1906, he co-founded, with N.F. Annensky, V.A. Miakotin and others, the Popular Socialist Party (NSP). After the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" events of January 1905, he was locked up in the Peter and Paul Fortress, then banished until October of that year, and again arrested for several months in 1906. During the following years, Peshekhonov published several books on agrarian, economic and political issues. In February 1917 Peshekhonov assumed leading roles as an NS delegate in the Petrograd Soviet of Worker's and Soldier's Deputies, with strong engagement on agrarian issues. He favoured co-operation of the Soviet with the (Kadet) Provisional Government, and in May 1917 joined the coalition government then formed as minister of food supplies. In October, he was deputy chairman of the pre-parliament council, and after the Bolshevik seizure of power joined the left-center opposition. In 1921 he played a leading role in organising famine relief for Russia. In the fall of 1922, Peshekhonov was included in the list of intellectuals to be exiled abroad by a Central Committee decree (although he does not seem to have travelled on the famous \\"Philosophers' ships\\" that took the bulk of them to Germany). Exiled against his will, more left-wing than most of his co-expellees, Peshekhonov unhappily pursued his economic and political studies in Berlin and Prague, but repeatedly applied for permission to return to the Soviet Union. This was never granted, but eventually he was given a post as a consultant to the Soviet Trade Mission in Riga, where he died in 1933. His remains were permitted to return and buried in Leningrad.

This species is native to the United States, where it remains only in Tennessee and Virginia. It was originally distributed in the Ohio River, Cumberland River and Tennessee River systems, but it has been extirpated from most of its previous range. Parmalee and Bogan reported that there were still populations in the Clinch River in Tennessee.Parmalee, P. W. and Bogan, A. E. (1998) The Freshwater Mussels of Tennessee. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press. Other populations that are known to survive are located in the Powell and Elk Rivers. Shell description These mussels have thin, fairly weak, elongated shells. The shells may reach up to in height The outer coloring of the shell varies from yellow to brown, while the interior of the shell is pale bluish white, with a purple beak cavity. Ecology This species spends its adult life buried under the sand or mud in the bottom of medium-sized, flowing rivers. The females capture sperm released into the water by males. They store the sperm until they need them to fertilize their eggs. After fertilization, the females release the larvae into the river where the larvae attach to fish. Once the larva mature into juveniles with shells, they leave their host fish and drop to the sediment where they bury themselves. This process, therefore, requires an environment with ample fish to act as hosts. They prefer relatively shallow (usually less than 2 ft deep) water with a moderate current. Conservation The main threats to the continued existence of this species are habitat changes due to damming of rivers, silting of rivers due to erosion caused by construction, farming and logging, and poisoning due to agricultural and industrial pollution. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has created a recovery plan for this species.

It was served by both the Great Western Railway (GWR) and London and South Western Railway (LSWR). There were actually two stations adjacent to each other, the northern station serving the line to Plymouth, which was built by the Launceston and South Devon Railway (later GWR), and the southern station being on the North Cornwall Railway (for the LSWR) which was operated by the London and South Western Railway. The two stations unusually shared a \\"back to back\\" signal box from 1916, despite being operated by different railway companies. A connection between the two railways was provided in 1943. The GWR station closed to passengers in 1952, all trains then using the LSWR station. The Launceston Steam Railway now operates nearby. History The station was opened on 1 June 1865 by the Launceston and South Devon Railway, a broad gauge line that connected with the South Devon and Tavistock Railway to offer a service to Plymouth Millbay railway station where connections could be made onto trains to London Paddington station. This line eventually became a part of the GWR. It was proposed in 1865 to extend the line to meet the Bude Canal, but the scheme failed to raise its capital. On 21 July 1886 a standard gauge line was opened from Halwill Junction, built by the North Cornwall Railway, which gave a direct route over the LSWR to London Waterloo station. The two companies kept separate stations for many years but on 22 September 1943 a connection was established between the two lines to give flexibility should the railway lines around Plymouth be damaged by World War II bombing. Other connections were installed at Lydford railway station and at St Budeaux. Trains continued to use their own company's platforms but on 18 June 1951, about three years after nationalisation and the formation of British Railways, the former GWR station became \\"Launceston North\\" and the former LSWR station became \\"Launceston South\\". These names did not stay in use for long as from 30 June 1952 the passenger trains from Plymouth were routed into the LSWR platforms. The two companies had, however, used a single signal box from December 1916 when the GWR's box was closed and the LSWR's widened to take two sets of equipment, one facing each line. The former LSWR's locomotive facilities were closed in the 1940s and locomotives then made use of the adjacent GWR facilities. Trains were withdrawn from the former GWR line on 31 December 1962; however, from 8 September 1964 until 28 February 1966 the line was reopened as far as Lifton railway station for goods traffic. Trains were withdrawn from the former LSWR line on 3 October 1966. Description The LSWR route passed over the GWR line east of the station and the 1943 connection was situated between this lattice girder bridge and the station. The northernmost platform one was that used, until 1952, by the GWR trains to and from Plymouth. As well as the track alongside the platform, there were two sidings and the southern one was alongside a loading platform. South of this was the platform for LSWR trains towards London, and then that for LSWR trains towards Padstow. It was on this latter platform that the LSWR's offices were situated. There were goods sheds for both lines, that for the GWR north of their platform; that for the LSWR south of theirs. Engine sheds for both lines were situated at the east end of the station between the two lines. Launceston Steam Railway Today, the site of both original stations is covered by an industrial estate. The stone steps that used to lead up to the metal overbridge are still extant but little else. A station for the Launceston Steam Railway has been built in a cutting slightly to the west of the old station site, using the canopy formerly at Tavistock North railway station. The railway started operation in 1983.

They were introduced in the course of the 1990s for hauling light trains, especially for commuter service. They were acquired by FS Trenitalia to replace the old E.424 and E.646, dating from the 1940s and 1950s. The class was originally designed by ABB Trazione, later ADTranz (now part of the Bombardier group), and produced in the Italian plant of Vado Ligure. Cost per unit is 2.6 million Euro. With 717 locomotives currently in service (as of December 2015) the E.464 is the largest class in use by Trenitalia, and also the most numerous Italian locomotive class ever in service. History The E.464 derives from a project launched by the Italian Ferrovie dello Stato in the 1980s for a \\"modular\\" class of locomotives which would be easily adapted to commuter, inter-regional and cargo services. Initially, types with 4-axle (Bo-Bo, E.453/E.454) and 6-axle (Bo-Bo-Bo, E.665/E.666) were devised, the latter for cargo services. However, the E.666 class was cancelled due to availability of the new E.652 Tigre class, capable of hauling massive cargo trains. Moreover, the new inverter technology was developed in those years, and the E.454 became suddenly obsolete. In 1994 FS requested ABB to design a new class which, to save money, was to be based on already built prototypes and using parts from the new E.412 from the same producer. The first batch of 50 E.464 was issued to the Lazio regional government in 1999-2000, and proved immediately successful. Further orders for 90, 100 and 48 units followed in 2001-2005, plus another 100 in 2006-2007, another 100 in 2009, another 50 in 2011, and, finally, another order of 29 locomotives on November 2013: a total of 717 locomotives, and an investment of over one billion Euro. After years of regional use, the 29th of August 2019 the first two units from a group of 70 were used to haul a long-distance Intercity train between Messina and Siracusa, in Sicily. Sicily is the first italian region to get E464 for long- distances train, because in this region this locomotives have to replace the older ones of E656‚Äôs class, but in the future E464 will be used to haul Intercity Night trains all around the country, because of their ability to reduce operating costs, thanks to the permanent use of 2 units together, creating a reversible train. 10 units are also used by Ferrovie Emilia Romagna and 1 by Trasporto Ferroviario Toscano for a total of 728 locomotives delivered in Italy. Technology The E.464 were the first Italian locomotives provided with an automatic Scharfenberg coupling system, capable of forming trains rapidly. The hull is steel with aluminium ceiling, in the white-green standard livery of FS Trenitalia. The locomotive uses simplified on-board electronics, with two GTO thyristor choppers which provide a variable voltage to the two inverters, that are used to feed the 4 three-phase asynchronous motors. The motors employ a double-star type connection; if a traction inverter is inoperative (i.e. due to a failure) the motors use a delta-type connection and are fed by only one inverter. During braking the motors can be used as generators in order to recover electric energy (regenerative braking). However, since Italian railway power substations are not able to receive energy (they are not reversible), this method only works if there are other trains nearby absorbing current and the line voltage is lower than 4000 V. Otherwise the power is dissipated through a braking rheostat. The vehicle braking logic checks if these conditions are met and then decides to send the current to the line or to the rheostat. Two static inverters (often referred to as BUR) output a voltage of 450 V, 60 Hz AC that feeds the auxiliary systems which include the compressors, 24 V battery charger, rheostat ventilation fans, motors fans etc. Usually BUR n.1 feeds only the motor cooling devices with a voltage down to 352 V at 58 Hz, while BUR n.2 feeds the rest; in case of failure of one BUR, one of the three motor fans is deactivated automatically and the system is fed at 450 V 60 Hz by the remaining one. Braking systems include, other than the regenerative/rheostat braking, disc-type brakes activated by compressed air to completely immobilize the locomotive when stationary. If this condition lasts for a prolonged time air may run out thereby releasing the brakes, in which case the spring brake is activated. The coupling system allows, in case of emergency, coupling of up to 4 locomotives for hauling heavy trains, for a total of 14,000 kW (more than one TGV). The E.464 can be coupled with other modern types like the E.402. The locomotive is provided with a secondary driving cabin with reduced instrumentation in the rear area, for short range manoeuvres in stations (maximum speed allowed: 30 km/h). Other users E.464 in Trenord livery at Milan's central station. Bombardier has produced 60 units especially adapted for use with the new Vivalto two-floor coaches. Apart from FS-Trenitalia (whose engines are often owned by regional authorities), E.464 is used in Lombardy by the regional railway company Trenord, and in Emilia-Romagna by the Ferrovie Emilia Romagna. , there are 727 class E.464 locos. 717 are operated by Trenitalia; 716 in the series 464.001-464.717 (464.029 was withdrawn after accident damage sustained in September 2009), and 464.880, which was formerly operated by TFT. 10 locos (464.890-893 and 464.901-906) are operated by TPER (ex-FER).

A military academy graduate, he came to prominence in Szeged in 1919 for his violent counterrevolutionary work and rose through the ranks to become one of the leading figures in the Gendarmerie.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 20 A member of several far right groups he finally left the gendarmes in 1938 (as a major-general) to join the Hungarian National Socialist Party, and passed through a number of incarnations of this fluid movement. He was elected as a deputy in 1939 and sat as a member of a Nazi coalition group. Close to Nazi Germany, he was appointed editor of the German-funded newspaper Magyars√°g. He soon became a close ally of Fid√©l P√°lffy and the two united with the followers of General Ruszkay and Ferenc Sz√°lasi to form a wider coalition of pro-Nazi conservatives and military men. After the Nazi invasion and occupation of Hungary in March 1944, Baky was elevated to state secretary in the Ministry of the Interior, under Andor Jaross. Along with his fellow state secretary, L√°szl√≥ Endre, Baky eagerly accepted responsibility for deporting the country's Jews to the extermination camps. Soon after his ascension, he wrote in a letter to Jaross, \\"The Royal Hungarian Government will soon have the country purged of Jews. I order the purge to be carried out by regions.

(24 February 1930 ‚Äì 20 December 2006) was a prominent American public health entomologist and Professor of Tropical Public Health in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH). Spielman was a world-renowned expert in the vector-borne illnesses malaria, Lyme disease, babesiosis and in the ways in which they are transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks. He was a major figure in the modern history of public health entomology. Biography =Youth, education and military service= Spielman earned a B.S. from Colorado College and an Sc. D. in the malaria lab at Johns Hopkins University in 1952, serving thereafter as a public health entomologist in the U.S. Navy (he left the service as a lieutenant commander). =Career= Spielman became a member of the faculty at HSPH in 1959, where he divided his time between the lab and the field. After George Healy, a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control, helped diagnose a second case of human babesiosis on Nantucket in 1973, Spielman traveled to the island for a series of visits to investigate the outbreaks of the disease which usually affects animals, destroying (like its relative malaria) their red blood cells. Although a handful of human cases had been reported worldwide, babesiosis was not previously known as an established human disease. On Nantucket, he trapped voles and mice and picked ticks from the animals' hides. He then shifted to laboratory work, successfully infecting hamsters with the babesia protozoan through the bites of infected deer ticks (Ixodes dammini, a species he named). By this approach, he was able to identify the tick responsible for what he called ‚ÄúNantucket fever\\" (it was not Dermacentor variabilis, the dog tick, as alleged by other investigators) and to point to the white-footed mouse as the pathogen's reservoir. (Later, deer ticks were shown to be the vector of Lyme disease.) In later years, he was granted an official title of Professor of Tropical Public Health under which he organized numerous symposia and consulted with governments, NGOs and corporations about the control of vector-borne diseases. He headed HSPH‚Äôs research laboratory of Public Health Entomology and directed a training program in Emerging Infectious Diseases for doctoral students and post- doctoral researchers. At Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, he directed the Malaria Epidemiology Program within the Center for International Development. =Personal life= A mosquito expert with a productive career as a tick researcher, Spielman said this was not such a paradox: \\"I am not a mosquito specialist. I am not a tick specialist. I am a transmission specialist\\". Spielman was beloved as mentor to two generations of students and postdoctoral fellows whom he encouraged in his special brand of combined lab and fieldwork, the latter including a boyish excitement for intrepid adventures such as spelunking and climbing cliffs. Spielman had three children (David, Deborah, and Sue) by his wife Judy; he had seven grandchildren (Madeline, Jacob, and Maya Beeders, Sara, Julia, Samantha, and Alex Spielman) at his death.  Accomplishments and legacy  *Spielman was author of more than 360 publications on the arthropod-borne diseases malaria, dengue, babesiosis, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, eastern equine encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis, and filariasis. First description of the life cycles and ecology of the agents of human babesiosis and Lyme disease Elucidation of the role of saliva and its production in vectors such as ticks and mosquitoes in transmitting diseases The first uses of growth regulators to interfere with normal mosquito development to aid mosquito control The exploration of the possibility that roosting birds play a key part in perpetuating the viruses that cause eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile encephalitis. Led the Phase II testing of the SmithKline Beecham Lyme disease vaccine among residents of Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and Block Island. =Ixodes dammini= Ixodes dammini, is responsible not only for the emergence of babesiosis in the U.S., but for a whole new group of tick-borne diseases, the best known of which is Lyme disease. In 1979, Spielman officially proclaimed the Nantucket version of the deer tick a separate species, naming it Ixodes dammini after Gustave Dammin, a prominent pathologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, because he had helped him with the research and was a property owner on Nantucket (Dammin's wife came from one of Nantucket's most prominent families). Spielman built his case for I. dammini being a separate species from Ixodes scapularis on the observations that the two ticks had very distinct ranges (I. dammini in the Northeast, I. scapularis in the South) and that I. dammini was morphologically different, especially at the nymphal stage. He also marshaled DNA evidence to make his case. Spielman fought a protracted, but probably ultimately losing, battle for I. dammini's identity as a separate species. Siding with researchers in Georgia, the editors of the Journal of Medical Entomology officially ruled that, taxonomically, I. dammini is identical to I. scapularis and that the two species should be \\"synonymized\\" under Ixodes scapularis. Spielman disagreed, he asserted that maintaining I. dammini's separate identity is key to understanding the ecology and epidemiology of tick-borne diseases.

In 1234, he was admitted to sit as a baron of the exchequer, and in 1236 again witnessed the confirmation of the charter. He was justice of the forest for nineteen counties in 1237, and from 1242 to 1246 sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire, the counties in which his estates lay. Montfichet was one of the baronial representatives on the committee to consider the king's demand for a subsidy in 1244, and probably therefore had a share in drafting the remarkable scheme of reform of that year. Family He married first Alice (fl. 1217), and then. Jousa or Joyce. He died in 1267 without issue, and his estates passed to the children of his three sisters. Montfichet is of chief note for his share in the struggle for the charter. He was the last survivor of the twenty-five ; his age probably prevented his taking any part in the later barons' war, which he outlived.

He was replaced in 1941 and subsequently is alleged to have organized an uprising against his replacement.

Shakabpa was member of the committee that also included Tsarong, Khenchen Lobsang Tashi, Gyetakba, as well as representatives from Reting and Sera Monasteries. Tsarong declared to the Assembly there was no evidence that Reting was strangled, there was no wound or anything.Melvyn C. Goldstein, A history of modern Tibet, 1913-1951: the demise of the Lamaist state, p. 511-512 The episode exposed a number of the political dimensions of the religious hierarchy in Lhasa.

History Purchased in 1968, the Foy property was originally an addition to Bonnechere Provincial Park, which is also located on Round Lake. As day use at Bonnechere Park became heavy in the early 1980s, the idea of creating another park on Round Lake was introduced. In 1985, it was put into regulation as Foy Provincial Park and designated as \\"recreation\\"-class. The stated goal of the park was to \\"maintain quality summer-oriented day use facilities.\\" Citing declining attendance, the Ministry of Natural Resources closed the day use facilities at Foy in 1994, along with seven other Ontario provincial parks. For many years the Round Lake Ontario Ranger Program operated out of Foy park. The Ontario Ranger Program was suddenly cancelled completely by the Liberal Government in 2012. Ecology The 1986 management plan called for two nature reserve zones, one on the west side of the park's point to protect a \\"wave cut terrace that is the evidence of a glacial lake's existence.\\" On the east side of the point, exposed clay made up the other reserve zone.

It refers to ethnocentric views held by consumers in one country, the in-group, towards products from another country, the out-group (Shimp & Sharma, 1987). Consumers may believe that it is not appropriate, and possibly even immoral, to buy products from other countries. Consumer ethnocentrism is derived from the more general psychological concept of ethnocentrism. Basically, ethnocentric individuals tend to view their group as superior to others. As such, they view other groups from the perspective of their own, and reject those that are different and accept those that are similar (Netemeyer et al., 1991; Shimp & Sharma, 1987). This, in turn, derives from earlier sociological theories of in-groups and out-groups (Shimp & Sharma, 1987). Ethnocentrism, it is consistently found, is normal for an in-group to an out-group (Jones, 1997; Ryan & Bogart, 1997). Purchasing foreign products may be viewed as improper because it costs domestic jobs and hurts the economy. The purchase of foreign products may even be seen as simply unpatriotic (Klein, 2002; Netemeyer et al., 1991; Sharma, Shimp, & Shin, 1995; Shimp & Sharma, 1987). Attributes Consumer ethnocentrism gives individuals an understanding of what purchases are acceptable to the in-group, as well as feelings of identity and belonging. For consumers who are not ethnocentric, or polycentric consumers, products are evaluated on their merits exclusive of their country of origin, or possibly even viewed more positively because they are foreign (Shimp & Sharma, 1987; Vida & Dmitrovic, 2001). Brodowsky (1998) studied consumer ethnocentrism among car buyers in the U.S. and found a strong positive relationship between high ethnocentrism and country-based bias in the evaluation of automobiles. Consumers with low ethnocentrism appeared to evaluate automobiles based more on the merits of the actual automobile rather than its country of origin. Brodowsky suggests that understanding consumer ethnocentrism is critical in understanding country of origin effects. Several antecedents of consumer ethnocentrism have been identified by various studies. Consumers who tend to be less ethnocentric are those who are young, those who are male, those who are better educated, and those with higher income levels (Balabanis et al., 2001; Good & Huddleston, 1995; Sharma et al., 1995). Balabanis et al. found that the determinants of consumer ethnocentrism may vary from country to country and culture to culture. In Turkey, patriotism was found to be the most important motive for consumer ethnocentrism (Acikdilli et al., 2017). This, it was theorized, was due to Turkey's collectivist culture, with patriotism being an important expression of loyalty to the group. In the more individualistic Czech Republic, feelings of nationalism based on a sense of superiority and dominance appeared to provide the most important contribution to consumer ethnocentrism. The CETSCALE Shimp and Sharma (1987) developed consumer ethnocentrism into a measurable construct through the use of the consumer ethnocentric tendencies scale (CETSCALE). The initial development of the CETSCALE began with 225 different questions, which were narrowed down to 100 before being sent to a survey group for the first purification study. Through repeated purification studies, the number of questions was finally reduced to 17. Repeated studies by Shimp and Sharma validated the CETSCALE in the U.S. While the 17-item CETSCALE is the original version developed by Shimp and Sharma (1987), shortened versions have been used. One, with 10 items, was developed alongside the full version. This is probably the most frequently used version of the CETSCALE, as a result of its relatively few number of questions (Balabanis et al., 2001; Klein, 2002; Klein et al., 1998; Neese & Hult, 2002; Netemeyer et al., 1991; Vida & Dmitrovic, 2001). Other versions have been used with success, including a version used by Klein (2002) with just four items that was found to have a .96 correlation with the 10-item version. The first major test of the validity of the CETSCALE in countries other than the U.S. was carried out in 1991 (Netemeyer et al., 1991; Wang, 1996). Netemeyer et al. surveyed students in the U.S., France, Japan, and West Germany and compared the results. Both the 17-item version and the 10-item version were tested. It was found that both versions of the CETSCALE were reliable across the different cultures where it was tested. The results also helped validate the CETSCALE as a measure of consumer ethnocentricity. Since that time, the CETSCALE has been used in many studies in many different countries and cultures.

She won wide respect as one of the leading businesswomen of her time.  Early life and education  Knox was one of three girls born to David and Amanda Markward of Mansfield, Ohio. In the late 1870s, Rose and her family moved to Gloversville, New York, where she lived until 1896. Rose met her husband, Charles Briggs Knox, in 1881: they married on February 15, 1883. Together Rose and Charles had three children: one girl who died in childhood, and two sons, one of whom died in early adulthood. In 1896 the family moved to Johnstown to set up a gelatin business after Charles Knox watched Rose making homemade gelatin in her kitchen. The Charles B. Knox Gelatin Company was located in a large four story factory building. Mr. and Mrs. Charles Knox were very close: Charles shared all his business affairs with his wife, making them partners in the business. Rose wrote recipe booklets promoting Knox's gelatin product, over a million of which were distributed each year.Who's who in commerce and industry, 2nd ed., 1938 Progressive for his time, Mr. Knox also allocated his wife a weekly allowance which she could do with as she pleased. This taught Rose how to handle and budget money, which came in handy when she was running the gelatin business herself.  Career  Knox became a businesswoman when her husband died in 1908, taking over his Knox Gelatin Factory. She made notable changes in the business. The first day she was there she permanently closed the back door of the factory, stating that all men and women were equal and that was the way she was going to be treating them: there was no need to have two separate doors. She also requested one of her husband‚Äôs top executives to resign after he was overheard saying he would not work for a woman. Throughout the years to come, Mrs. Knox made many other changes. One of the most famous things she did was to create a five-day work week for her workers, and she also gave them two weeks of paid vacation, something that was unheard of before. Mrs. Knox survived the Depression without having to release any of her workers. She was a Presbyterian in religion and a Republican in politics.American women: the official who's who, 1935 She died aged 93, in 1950.

Written two years after Winston Churchill's Sinews of Peace address, Atomsk is the first espionage novel of the Cold War, inaugurating a genre exemplified by writers such as Ian Fleming and John Le Carr√©. Linebarger's third published novel, it has long been out of print. Paper copies regularly command figures in the hundreds of U.S. dollars in the second-hand market, even though it is also available as an inexpensive e-book. As well as drawing on Linebarger's own expertise in the field of psychological warfare, it is a study of the personality of a U.S. operative (Major Michael Dugan) who has little in common with James Bond except his extreme resourcefulness under cover and in danger. A man of many identities who sees himself to some extent as a blank sheet, he goes from calling himself \\"Comrade Nobody\\" to saying \\"I'm anybody\\".

Formerly associated with George Mason University and the Center for Media and Public Affairs, STATS is currently associated with Jon Entine's Science Literacy Project and Sense About Science USA. History STATS was founded in 1994 by S. Robert Lichter, a professor of communications at George Mason University. In 2001, Lichter and his staff published It Ain't Necessarily So, a book about the media's coverage of a range of topics from crime statistics to the 2001 anthrax attacks. The Philadelphia Inquirer called it \\"a solid critique of the way data-based reports and studies are presented in the media\\", while Salon.com felt that the book employed \\"the very same tactics that it finds so objectionable when used by journalists and publishers\\". In 2007 STATS sponsored a survey of climate scientists, which was conducted by Harris International. The survey found that most climate scientists believe that human-induced global warming is occurring, although there is disagreement about its consequences, and few trust the popular media coverage of climate change. A 2009 article in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel argued that STATS's coverage of the chemical Bisphenol A verged on advocacy for the chemical industry. On the STATS website, Lichter posted a response disputing the Journal-Sentinel article, calling its reporting and logic \\"flawed\\". In 2010, Donors Trust awarded STATS $86,000 for its \\"research efforts\\". STATS was dissolved in 2014, and its web site adopted by Sense About Science USA. Overview According to the organization's 2006 website its goal is to help correct \\"scientific misinformation in the media resulting from bad science, politics, or a simple lack of information or knowledge; and to act as a resource for journalists and policy makers on major scientific issues and controversies\\". As Lichter related to the Baltimore Sun in 1998, \\"journalists are deluged with numbers representing findings in fields they're not familiar with\\". Its sister organization is the Center for Media and Public Affairs, also affiliated with George Mason. =Personnel= Before the organization was dissolved in 2016, Lichter served as the organization's president. Other personnel included director of research Rebecca Goldin, a professor of mathematical sciences at George Mason and the Ruth Michler Fellow at Cornell University, and STATS.org editor Trevor Butterworth, who is also listed as a senior fellow, and writes for the Huffington Post. , other senior fellows included Maia Szalavitz, a contributor to Reason magazine, and Stephen Rose. The first director of STATS was David Murray, who previously worked for the Heritage Foundation and was later chief scientist for the United States Office of National Drug Control Policy. STATS is now a project of Sense About Science USA =Fundraising= The organization does not publicize their donors nor disclose their donors on Internal Revenue Service filings, but a review of IRS documents did show a $100,000 donation from the Sarah Scaife Foundation in 2007, a number that nearly equaled the listed assets of the Statistical Assessment Service. Activities STATS produced an annual list called the \\"Dubious Data Awards\\", highlighting egregious factual inaccuracies in news reporting. In 2006, it challenged a study by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, used by The New York Times and Forbes, which claimed that almost half of the alcohol industry's revenue came from underage drinkers. According to STATS, American teenagers who drink alcohol would each have to consume more than 1,000 drinks per year for this to be true. STATS has also disagreed with recommendations from Time that parents should discontinue use of soft vinyl toys, teethers, and similar products containing phthalates. STATS made this case based on the fact that phthalates in children's toys have been cleared for use by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission; however, the European Union's Institute for Health and Consumer Protection has taken the opposite position, restricting the use of phthalate plasticizers in children's toys since 1998 and banning their manufacture in the E.U. in 2015 due to persistent health concerns. The annual list has received coverage from The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, among other news organizations. In 2004, STATS was quoted in newspaper articles about the use of statistics in political rhetoric. During the presidential election of 2004, the organization challenged claims by both George W. Bush and John Kerry at the request of the Associated Press. STATS sponsored educational workshops, seminars, and webinars, such as the 2013 webinar, \\"Understanding Risk: A Primer for Journalists\\" at the National Press Foundation.: Goldin lectures at universities and colleges across the country about the use and misuse of statistics, and was a Nifty Fifty Speaker for the U.S. Science and Engineering Festival in both 2012 and 2014.: References External links *STATS official website *Statistical Assessment Service on SourceWatch Category:Non- profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.

Life  Ganda was born in Niamey, the capital of Niger, in 1935 and was of Djerma ethnicity. He completed his primary studies in Niamey and at the age of 16 joined the French Far East Expeditionary Corps as a soldier from 1951 to 1955. After spending two years in Asia during the First Indochina War he returned to Niger, where he was unable to find work. He emigrated to C√¥te d'Ivoire and became a longshoreman in the port of Abidjan. There he met French anthropologist and filmmaker Jean Rouch. Rouch was interested in the Nigerien community in C√¥te d'Ivoire and hired Ganda as a statistician for his research on immigration. It was Rouch who introduced Ganda to the cinema. Ganda had a small role in Rouch's 1957 film Zazouman de Treichville, and the lead role in Moi, un Noir (I, a Negro) in 1958. A few years later he returned to Niamey, where he became involved in the Franco-Nigerien Cultural Center. In the Center's Culture and Cinema club he met technicians who offered training in directing, camera, and sound, and he became an assistant technician. The club produced several films, and in 1968 organized a screenplay contest, for which Ganda wrote the script of his first film, Cabascabo, based on his experiences in Indochina. He continued making films throughout the 1970s, many of which received international acclaim and were vehicles of social commentary in what was then a single party state. His most famous, Le Wazzou Polygame (1970) won the first FESPACO Film Festival Best Film Award. In addition to his dramatic films, Ganda completed several documentaries and was working on one at the time of his death of a heart attack on January 1, 1981. = Posthumous honors = Among his posthumous honors, a major cultural center, performance, and library complex in Niamey, Le Centre Culturel Oumarou GANDA (C.C.O.G) was named for him in 1981, shortly after his death.Biblioth√®que du Centre Culturel Oumarou Ganda .

The film was written by William Nicholson and directed by Norman Stone. It starred Dirk Bogarde, Lee Remick and Helena Bonham Carter. It was episode 1 of the fourth series of Screen Two. Filming locations included The Exchange, Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff, South Glamorgan, Wales, United Kingdom. The film was the main feature on the front cover of the Radio Times when it was first shown. Plot A sinister cult uses a new television station to create a new European order. Dirk Bogarde plays a has-been UK TV personality hired to front the organisation but grows uneasy about its aims. At the end of the film, he attempts to warn the television audience about the dangers they face during the station's first transmission. But he fails to realise that recorded footage is being played during his \\"live\\" broadcast. He only realises when he is escorted from the studio by a stony-faced security guard and sees on the television monitors the (innocuous) beginning of his broadcast followed by a swift cut to his interviewer who thanks him for his contribution and then announces the showing of their first film, Back to the Future. Music Bill Connor wrote the original music for the film. The film features the sound track Watch the Skies by Ken Howard.

TeleRadyo (previously known as DZMM TeleRadyo) is a Philippine pay television channel that broadcasts ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station DZMM 630. The channel is owned by the ABS-CBN Corporation under the ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs brand, and is available on cable providers throughout the Philippines. TeleRadyo is also included as an exclusive (free-to-view) digital subchannel on digital terrestrial television via the ABS-CBN TVplus service. TeleRadyo is also simulcast via The Filipino Channel (TFC) and it can be heard and viewed online via DZMM's YouTube channel and iWant TFC. Prior to the closure of DZMM 630 at 8:00 PM on May 5, 2020 (local time), the channel was named DZMM TeleRadyo. At 8:20 PM, the station went off the air due to a cease and desist order of the National Telecommunications Commission together with ABS-CBN, S+A, and MOR Philippines. After DZMM 630 kHz was shut down on May 5, 2020, the channel was renamed simply as TeleRadyo. Although it also went off-air a few minutes after, the channel went back on-air and online on May 8, 2020, resuming the programming of the former DZMM. Description DZMM TeleRadyo features a simulcast of DZMM's radio programs as well as live video feed of the radio booth itself. As a result, viewers can hear DZMM 630, and see the people currently in the studio speaking on air, or in the case of special live occasions, live video footage simulcasted on the radio station can be also seen with a clearer audio provided from the feed. Radio shows that have music aired on this station will be supplemented with pictures of artists (during Yesterday and Remember When) or random pictures instead of the studio scenes on selected programs. Moonlight Serenade is also a music program, however it only shows random pictures instead of artist pictures while the song is playing. Content during commercial breaks are separate from advertisements in the radio feed which currently shows promotions for TeleRadyo and other ABS-CBN channels and becomes full-screen on datascreen, or disappears on full-screen graphical format during non-produced advertisements. The channel, however, simulcasts the Three O' Clock prayer and the station ID, as well as station's sign-on and sign-off messages depending on the broadcast content. In some cases when the radio feed will air programming only dedicated to theirs like the UAAP men's basketball Finals coverage from 2013 to 2014 and during the PiliPinas Debates 2016 (presidential debates in Cagayan de Oro (GMA) and Cebu (TV5), and the vice-presidential debate, aired on CNN Philippines), regular-scheduled programming will continue for TeleRadyo viewers until the coverage for radio ends. The timing with TeleRadyo and the radio feed can depend on the factors. The TeleRadyo can be delayed at seven seconds in Metro Manila if the radio feed is heard using the 630 frequency via AM radio, while it would be more advanced by 3 seconds or more when the radio feed is heard via online streaming. Since June 19, 2017, DZMM set-up an additional studio set for its radio programs such as Sakto, Good Vibes, Todo-Todo Walang Preno and On The Spot as part of the station's plans to convert into a full-fledged news channel in the future. As of March 18, 2020, DZMM 630 and TeleRadyo begin to share channel space with its sister English-language news network ABS-CBN News Channel as part of larger ABS-CBN News coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic every Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays; with ANC's relay of DZMM programs on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. This arrangement ended on April 20. Programming As mentioned above, TeleRadyo primarily simulcasts programs from its radio counterpart, AM-630 kHz, excluding its advertising (including sponsorship for introducing a report or timecheck) and sometimes, its station ID and the Three O'Clock prayer which depends on the broadcast content. Also, the channel and its radio counterpart briefly sign-off the air every Sundays from 10:30 pm to every Mondays at 4:00 am (with an exception where both needed for the overnight news coverage for special events or most dire situations) It simulcasts the sign-on and sign-off audio notices from the radio station, but showing a loop of the TeleRadyo's logo animation for its viewers. The TeleRadyo test card is then placed in full screen when no programming content is present during the sign-off window hours. However, TeleRadyo also broadcasts its own breakaway schedule. This happens when the programme broadcast on AM-630 kHz is prerecorded. Programming produced by TeleRadyo are MMK Klasiks (a program featuring MMK episodes from the past, mostly from 1996 until early 2000 episodes; replacing the pre-recorded radio only MMK sa DZMM, but later moved to its new timeslot, first pre-empting the first 30 minutes of Dr. Love: Always and Forever, and currently pre-empting the last 30 minutes of Usapang de Campanilla, which effectively pre-empt the latter in its entirety) and the television-only segment of MMDA (and Go Manila) Metro Traffic Live. Headline Pilipinas previously aired exclusively on TeleRadyo, but following programming changes, it began simulcasting on the AM counterpart on June 16, 2017, moving the radio-only MMK sa DZMM to a later timeslot. ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs late night programming (branded as Pinoy True Stories, but not mentioned on air) are also broadcast to this channel at 10:00 pm (formerly at 9:30 pm). This NCA late night block airs first on this channel and its radio counterpart, before airing it on the mother network ABS-CBN after Bandila at around midnight. Previously from 2011 to 2012, NCA programming also aired on the channel (but not under Pinoy True Stories) including S.O.C.O. at 9:15pm replacing 45 minutes of Usapang de Campanilla. ABS-CBN weekend programs (Rated K, Matanglawin, Ipaglaban Mo!, S.O.C.O., and Kuha Mo!) are aired at the 2:00 pm slot, replacing MMK sa DZMM and Wow Trending (which airs on the radio station). Replays of ABS-CBN's late-night and weekend programming are aired from 1:00 am to 2:30 am Tuesday to Saturday, pre-empting Moonlight Serenade for one and a half hour, relegating the latter music program to the AM counterpart for the first one and a half hour before TeleRadyo joins for the rest of the program. In addition, an early edition of ABS-CBN's late night newscast Bandila was aired at 10:00 pm on DZMM 630 AM and DZMM TeleRadyo, while Bandila's main edition continues to air on ABS-CBN weeknights, right after Tonight with Boy Abunda. The program was discontinued on May 10, 2019. MMK Klasiks and ABS-CBN's weekend programs are exclusive programs to DZMM TeleRadyo and are not being broadcast on DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 itself. Just as with ABS-CBN News Channel, in case of developing stories, sudden breaking news or even important or scheduled live coverage, DZMM TeleRadyo pre-empts its regularly scheduled programming to give way for the developing news stories and/or coverage as it happens. Regular scheduled programs resume once the coverage of an important event has ended. =COVID-19 pandemic and ABS-CBN shutdown= Due to skeletal workforce imposed by the network due to the COVID-19 pandemic, DZMM TeleRadyo and Radyo Patrol 630 began to simulcast ANC newscasts and programs on some days and vice versa on other days for the coverage from March 19, 2020. However, the simulcast for the radio counterpart would break-away with a simulcast of MOR 101.9 on 10:00 PM until 4:30 AM. On April 1, given the decision to vacate the studios for the self-quarantine of many of the staff and the disinfection measures after being exposed to two PUIs, the channel provisionally broadcast ANC programming round the clock (with a 10pm breakaway for radio as it had been the case). Regular broadcasts resumed a day later on April 2. On May 5, 2020, DZMM TeleRadyo rebranded simply as TeleRadyo after the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a cease-and-desist order against its radio counterpart and other ABS- CBN free TV and radio stations nationwide. The last program to air on May 5 was S.R.O., which was supposed to air until 11:00 pm (PST) but ended broadcasts at 8:20 pm instead. Most DZMM TeleRadyo programming resumed on May 8 at 5:00 am (PST) where the old DZMM TeleRadyo logo appeared as a secondary logo (and as a bumper logo) beginning midday, with the TeleRadyo logo being primary. On May 10, 2020, its refurbished logo and bumper began to be used full-time replacing the old logos and bumper. On May 15, 2020, ANC stopped its simulcast with TeleRadyo and it was replaced by the replay episodes of Todo Todo Walang Preno (from 11:00 pm to 12:00 mn), Good Vibes (from 12:00 mn to 1:00 am), Failon Ngayon (from 1:00 am to 3:00 am), and Lingkod Kapamilya (from 3:00 am to 5:30 am). On May 16 to 17, 2020, TV Patrol Weekend (from 10:00 pm to 11:00 pm), Usapang Kalye (from 11:00 pm to 12:00 mn), Lima at Logan: Tandem (from 12:00 mn to 1:00 am), Konsyumer Atbp. (from 1:00 am to 2:30 am), Omaga Diaz Report (from 2:30 am to 3:30 am), Good Job (from 3:30 am to 5:00 am) and Kape at Salita (from 5:00 am to 6:00 am), started replaying episodes on TeleRadyo as well. On May 27, 2020, the channel's primary bumper was updated.

The show was executive produced by veteran Looney Tunes director/animator Chuck Jones, sponsored by the Kellogg's cereal company and created as a commercial rival to the successful public television series Sesame Street. Curiosity Shop was broadcast from September 11, 1971 to September 2, 1973. The program featured three inquisitive children (two boys and a girl) who each week visited a shop populated with various puppets and gadgets, discovering interesting things about science, nature and history. Each hour-long show covered a specific theme: clothing, music, dance, weather, the five senses, space, time, rules, flight, dolls,Curiosity Shop: Princess Of Pure Delight etc. All episodes of the series are presumed lost.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066644/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv Talent The executive producer was animator Chuck Jones, who contributed two new animated characters to the show: * Professor S. I. Trivia, a bespectacled \\"bookworm,\\" who lived in a dictionary and was always on hand to supply a definition to a word the children didn't know. * Monsieur Cou Cou was a French-accented bird, whose catchphrase was, \\"That's right!\\" He always tried to catch Prof. Trivia with a nosedive before the worm invariably dodged the bird just in time, repeatedly causing him to ram into the dictionary and get his beak stuck in it. Noted screenwriter Irving Phillips provided some scripts and animation art for the show,Los Angeles Times http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/01/local/me-45133 including an animation of his long-running syndicated comic strip The Strange World of Mr. Mum. Animations of Mell Lazarus's comic strip Miss Peach, Johnny Hart's comic strip The Wizard Of Id, Virgil Partch's cartoon Big George and Hank Ketcham's Dennis the Menace were also presented on the show. Abraham \\"Abe\\" Levitow, late of Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Local 839, animated most of these short segments. Ray Bradbury is also credited as a writer for the show.Curiosity Shop at the Internet Movie Database PBS premiered Sesame Street in November 1969. The show proved to be successful and gained high ratings. The show‚Äôs success gained attention from Michael Eisner, ABC‚Äôs Vice President. He asked Jones to create a series to rival its success, to which he agreed. Kellogg‚Äôs signed on to be the show‚Äôs sponsor. Jones and Eisner tapped puppeteer Bob Baker (cofounder of the Bob Baker Children‚Äôs Marionette Theater) to create the show‚Äôs puppets and its setting, but Baker was reluctant at first and agreed. Henry Mancini, an recent Academy Award-winning composer, composed the theme music of the program for its animated title sequence, which was animated by Jones and set to a bossa-nova theme.Curiosity Shop Introduction Dean Elliott wrote other music for the show.Curiosity Shop at the Internet Movie Database Cast John Levin and Kerry McLane played Gerard and Ralph, the two boys. Alternating in the girl's role were Pamelyn Ferdin as Pam and Jerelyn Fields as Cindy. Barbara Minkus made a regular appearance as Gittle, a witch who magically appeared whenever someone said a phrase that included \\"which.\\"Barbara Minkus as seen on TV's \\" Curiosity Shop\\" Darwin was a chimpanzee who made his home in a treehouse on the show.

Mouse, who often emerged from the wall to scream for quiet as well. * Nostalgia, a chronically forgetful but sweet-tempered elephant. * Hermione Giraffe * Aarthur the Aardvark * Ole Factory the Bloodhound * Halcyon the Hyena * Miss Fowler, a flower in a pot. Inanimate characters * A talking computer with tape-reel eyes who satisfied the children's curiosity about any subject and presented educational movies, tapes, cartoons, vocabulary series, etc., on his screen-mouth. * Hudson, a gravelly-voiced rock who told stories of prehistory.

It was founded in 1951 and was based in Coburg until its closure in 2009. It is also the name of the publishing house that develops the magazine (Nation Europa Verlag). History Founded by former SS commander Arthur Ehrhardt and Herbert Boehme, it took its title from a phrase sometimes used by Oswald Mosley to describe his Europe a Nation vision. Adopting a European-wide vision, writers such as Gaston-Armand Amaudruz and Maurice Bard√®che were closely associated with the publication.

He brought some of Ati≈õa's relics with him.Dowman, Keith. (1988). The Power-Places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide, pp. 91-95. Routledge & Kegan Paul, London. .McCue, Gary. Trekking in Tibet: A Traveler's Guide. The Mountaineers Books, 1999 It was the first major monastery of the Sarma revival. Je Tsongkhapa (1357‚Äì1419) reformed the Kadam, which then became known as the Gelug lineage and Reting became an important Gelug monastery, the seat of the Reting Rinpoche.Dowman, Keith. (1988). The Power-Places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide, p. 94. Routledge & Kegan Paul, London. . The Reting Rinpoches were responsible for the successful search and discovery of the 14th Dalai Lama. The Reting Rinpoches were among the candidates for Regent during the minority of a Dalai Lama. Thus, the Reting Rinpoche was Regent between 1845 and 1855 and, again, from 1933-1947. The latter Regent, the Fifth Reting Rinpoche, was involved in the search for the present Dalai Lama and became his Senior Tutor, later abdicated his position and was found guilty of colluding with the Chinese and died in a Tibetan prison in 1947. In fact his Shugdenpa accusers who were in power are generally held responsible for his murder were colluding with the Chinese Ambon. They also destroyed the Gelug Reting Monastery and killed many in Lhasa.Mayhew, Bradley and Kohn, Michael (2005). Tibet, 6th Edition, (2005), p. 142, Lonely Planet Publications. .\\"Biography of Reting Rinpoche.\\" The political confusion which followed aided the rapid collapse of Tibet after the Chinese invaded. The Sixth Reting Rinpoche died in 1997. The Chinese announced in January 2001 that a new incarnation had been chosen as the Seventh Reting Rinpoche, just two days after the Karmapa began his flight to India. This incarnation has not been recognised by the Dalai Lama who believes he is a pawn in the attempt by the Chinese to control the Buddhist religion in Tibet. Reting was devastated by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, and has only been partially restored. Footnotes References *Goldstein, Melvyn C.

Most of these originally settled in the Cape Colony, but were absorbed into the Afrikaner and Afrikaans-speaking population, because they had religious similarities to the Dutch colonists. Early arrivals Huguenots building their homesteads Even before the large-scale arrival of the Huguenots at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th century, a small number of individual Huguenot refugees settled there. They included Francois Villion, later known as Viljoen, and the du Toit brothers. In fact, the first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was Maria de la Quellerie, the wife of governor Jan van Riebeeck, who started the settlement at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 on behalf of the Dutch East India Company; however, she and her husband left for Batavia after ten years. After a commissioner was sent out from the Cape Colony in 1685 to attract more settlers, a more dedicated group of immigrants began to arrive. A larger number of French refugees began to arrive in the Cape after leaving their country as a result of the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which revoked the Edict of Nantes (1598) that had granted religious toleration to Protestants. Mass migration On 31 December 1687 a group of Huguenots set sail from France as the first of the large scale emigration of Huguenots to the Cape of Good Hope, which took place during 1688 and 1689. In total some 180 Huguenots from France, and 18 Walloons from present-day Belgium, eventually settled at the Cape of Good Hope. A notable example of this is the emigration of Huguenots from La Motte d'Aigues in Provence, France. After this large scale emigration, individual Huguenot immigrant families arrived at the Cape of Good Hope as late as the first quarter of the 18th century, and the state- subsidised emigration of Huguenots was stopped in 1706. This small body of immigrants had a marked influence on the character of the Dutch settlers. They were purposely spread out and given farms amongst the Dutch farmers. Owing to the policy instituted in 1701 of the Dutch East India Company which dictated that schools should teach exclusively in Dutch, that all official correspondence had to be done in Dutch, and strict laws of assembly, the Huguenots ceased by the middle of the 18th century to maintain a distinct identity, and the knowledge of French diminished and eventually disappeared as a home language.History of the French Protestant Refugees, from the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes to our own days. M. Charles Weiss (Translated from the French by Henry William Herbert), 1854. New York: Stringer & Townsend. This assimilation into the colonial population was also due to the fact that many Huguenot descendants married individuals from the Dutch population. Franschhoek Franschhoek Valley Many of these settlers were allocated farms in an area later called Franschhoek, Dutch for \\"French corner\\", in the present-day Western Cape province of South Africa. The valley was originally known as Olifantshoek (\\"Elephant's Corner\\"), so named because of the vast herds of elephants that roamed the area. The name of the area soon changed to le Coin Fran√ßais (\\"the French Corner\\"), and later to Franschhoek, with many of the settlers naming their new farms after the areas in France from which they came. La Motte, La Cotte, Cabriere, Provence, Chamonix, Dieu Donne and La Dauphine were among some of the first established farms-‚Äîmost of which still retain their original farm houses today. Museum and monuments The Huguenot Museum in Franschhoek. The Huguenot Monument of Franschhoek. A large monument to commemorate the arrival of the Huguenots in South Africa was inaugurated on 17 April 1948 at Franschhoek. A museum dedicated to the Huguenot history in South Africa is located adjacent to the monument.

The Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod) Background John Campanius was born in Stockholm and attended Uppsala University, where he studied theology and graduated in 1633. He was ordained into the Lutheran ministry during 1633. He served as the chaplain to the Swedish delegation in Russia in 1634. He then moved to Norrt√§lje, where he served as a schoolmaster beginning in 1636. He also served as chaplain and preceptor of the Stockholm Orphan's Home, a position he continued in through 1642.Early Clergy of Pennsylvania and Delaware(S. F. Hotchkin, Philadelphia, PA: P. W. Ziegler & Co., Publishers, 1890) New Sweden Campanius left Stockholm on August 16, 1642 and arrived at New Sweden on February 15, 1643. He came to accompany the first Swedish settlers to Fort Christina, near present-day Wilmington, Delaware, and served as a missionary to the nearby Lenape Indians. Campanius served as a replacement for the first Swedish Lutheran Minister, Reorus Torkillus who had recently died. For several years the New Sweden colony had no specific location for organized worship. Campanius had to visit the settlers at their cabins, which ranged all the way up to Fort Nya Gothenburg on Tinicum Island. John Campanius dedicated the new church at Tinicum on September 4, 1646. One of the few items which remain from his time of service is a gilded silver chalice used in celebrating the Eucharist.Dictionary of American Religious Biography. (Henry Warner Bowden. Westport, CT: Greenwood, Press, 1977) Campanius also began to make notable headway in evangelizing the Lenape. He gained a good grasp of their language, and learned how to preach to them with good effect. He also transliterated their words, numbers, and common phrases for the use of later missionaries. For example, he accommodated the Lord's Prayer to the American circumstances by substituting for \\"daily bread\\" \\"a plentiful supply of venison and corn.\\" After gaining experience in this way, he eventually was able to translate Luther's Small Catechism into the Lenape language. This effort, which was not printed until 1696 (Stockholm),Bente, Friedrich, 1858-1930. American Lutheranism Volume 1: Early History of American Lutheranism: Lutheran Swedes in Delaware. Concordia: 1919, p.11. is one of the first attempts by a European native to create a written document in one of the indigenous American languages. It was published in the Delaware and Swedish languages, together with a vocabulary. Campanius also studied the traditions of the natives, and recorded them in his journal. While this did help to preserve some anthropological information on them, it also helped perpetrate the idea that the Native Americans were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel.New Sweden on the Delaware 1638-1655 (C. A. Weslager. Wilmington, Delaware:The Middle Atlantic Press. 1988) By 1647, he wrote to his Archbishop in Stockholm that he had gotten weary of his work in New Sweden, and requested that he be allowed to return home. In 1648, three other ministers were sent to New Sweden to continue his work and Campanius was allowed to return to Sweden. There he served as minister of churches at H√§rnevi and Fr√∂sthult in Uppsala County in east central Sweden until his death in 1683. In these positions, he also worked on completing his translation of Luther's catechism. Both John Campanius and his wife Margareta were buried at the Fr√∂sthult Church in Enk√∂ping Municipality.This Day In Religion. (Ernie Gross.

He is considered by some to be the first weatherman in America because he kept a daily record of the weather at New Sweden. The records included at least 1644 and 1645 and were published in Sweden in 1702.

It forms part of the Sri Lanka Special Forces, alongside the Commando Regiment (CR), Army Special Forces Regiment (SF), and Air Force Special Forces (SLAFSF). Role Special Boat Squadron troops during training The SBS was modeled after the Special Boat Service of the Royal Navy. In its role as a naval special forces unit it takes up a wide variety of operations such as amphibious raids, maritime counter-terrorism, reconnaissance and target indication, combat swimmer missions and small boat operations. As a Special Forces unit, its role is not limited to water-borne operations.

Independence day parade History Due to frequent resistance and various asymmetric tactics near the naval troop deployed areas in the country, the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) recognized the imminent need to raise a specially trained counter terrorist team and realized the value of special operations in the early stages of confronting separatist terrorism that devastated the country for over three decades. Although not formerly commissioned, the urge for action of a few young and unique officers and men who were more than willing to put themselves in harm's way at the enemy's doorstep, was evident in the early confrontation with the LTTE. Among them, Lieutenant Commander Shanthi Bahar had been a pioneer to lead a small team of specially trained sailors seeking LTTE hideouts in the jungles and thickets of Trincomalee. His untimely death in action delayed the foundation of a naval special force by many years. The LTTE grew from a guerrilla group to a quasi-conventional force, and the Sea Tigers to a considerable strength. The LTTE and its war fighting mechanism solely depended on the Sea Tiger force for survival, first on the logistic train from the high seas, kept open in spite of a determined offensive of the Navy. Secondly, the Sea Tigers were an irritable distraction that taxed the Navy's resources to keep sea lines of communication with the Northern Peninsula. Thirdly, the Sea Tigers mastered asymmetric warfare with suicide boats, divers, mines and littoral attacks in coastal waters and lagoons The Special Boat Squadron (SBS) was formerly inaugurated on 18 January 1993 at SLNS Elara in Karainagar, the major naval base in the Jaffna Peninsula in the early nineties. The first batch of two aspiring officers and 76 sailors, mostly recruits and a few Leading rates, joined on voluntary commitment to form the future elite commando of the Navy. Nevertheless, the toll of training attrition was high, as only the strong remained and the weak faded away throughout the rigorous training process. Finally, both officers and 25 of the ratings survived to form the nucleus of the Special Boat Squadron under the charismatic leadership of Lieutenant Commander RC Wijegunaratne. Two subalterns, Lieutenant Channa Jayasinghe and Sub Lieutenant SW Gallage, were willing and dedicated officers who would dare the impossible to strike the enemy, as they had proven again and again in small group raids they did during their stints. Moreover SBS developed training on special boat tactics to fight in brown waters and coastal shallows. Soon the squadron grew up into a versatile force capable of covert and overt operations on land and sea. Capacity building and rigorous training made the force capable of clandestine waterborne entry and even air mobile to operate deep in enemy controlled land. The versatility includes pre-assault special missions in amphibious landing and small boat tactics to battle with the enemy in close-quarters surface combat. The first litmus test for SBS to examine their readiness came even before completion of training to establish an amphibious lodgement to reinforce the besieged Poonaryn camp. The entire amphibious landing had been a joint affair, though SBS alongside boat crews of in-shore patrol craft and dinghies had played a pivotal role in the assault wave under enemy fire. Starting as a small element by securing significant victories, the Special Boat Squadron fought with heavily armed, highly manoeuvrable Arrow Craft, to seal the fate of the LTTE until the end of separatist war against the LTTE.

It is a hard-bodied tick found in the eastern and northern Midwest of the United States as well as in southeastern Canada. It is a vector for several diseases of animals, including humans (Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, Powassan virus disease, etc.) and is known as the deer tick owing to its habit of parasitizing the white-tailed deer. It is also known to parasitize mice, lizards, migratory birds, etc. especially while the tick is in the larval or nymphal stage. Deer tick Description The image shown here‚Äîand in fact, most images of Ixodes scapularis that are commonly available‚Äîshow an adult that is unengorged, that is, an adult that has not had a blood meal. This is natural, since ticks are generally removed immediately upon discovery to minimize the chance of disease. However, the abdomen that holds blood is much larger when engorged; therefore, an engorged specimen of I. scapularis (see photo below) could easily be mistaken for an entirely different tick. When the deer tick has consumed a blood meal, its abdomen is a light grayish-blue color. The tick itself is naturally black when unfed. In identifying an engorged tick, concentrating on the legs and upper part of the body is helpful. Behavior I. scapularis has a 2-year lifecycle, during which time it passes through three stages: larva, nymph, and adult. The tick must take a blood meal at each stage before maturing to the next. Deer tick females latch onto a host and drink its blood for 4-5 days. Deer are the preferred host of the deer tick, but it is also known to feed on small rodents. After she is engorged, the tick drops off and overwinters in the leaf litter of the forest floor. The following spring, the female lays several hundred to a few thousand eggs in clusters. Transtadial (between tick stages) passage of Borrelia burgdorferi is common. Vertical passage (from mother to egg) of Borrelia is uncommon. Like other ticks, I. scapularis is hardy. It can be active after a hard frost, as daytime temperatures can warm it enough to keep it actively searching for a host. In the spring, it can be one of the first invertebrates to become active. Deer ticks can be quite numerous and seemingly gregarious. Deer tick lifecycle As disease vector Deer tick 3D rendering of a male and female deer tick Ixodes scapularis is the main vector of Lyme disease in North America. The CDC reported over 30,000 new cases of the disease in 2016 alone, the majority of which were contracted in the summer months, which is when ticks are most likely to bite humans. It can also transmit other Borrelia species, including Borrelia miyamotoi. Ticks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other parasites, such as Theileria microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. Among early Lyme disease patients, depending on their location, 2%‚Äì12% will also have HGA and 2%‚Äì40% will have babesiosis. Engorged deer tick Co-infections complicate Lyme symptoms, especially diagnosis and treatment. It is possible for a tick to carry and transmit one of the co-infections and not Borrelia, making diagnosis difficult and often elusive. The Centers for Disease Control's emerging infectious diseases department did a study in rural New Jersey of 100 ticks, and found 55% of the ticks were infected with at least one of the pathogens. Deer, the preferred mammalian hosts, cannot transmit Borrelia spirochaetes to ticks. Ticks acquire Lyme disease microbes by feeding on infected mice and other small rodents. One of the keys of the success of I. scapularis as a Borrelia vector relies on its ability to limit the proliferation of the spirochaete. This is due to the activity of domesticated amidase effector (dae) genes. Dae genes are a family of horizontally acquired genes related to type VI secretion amidase effector (tae) genes in certain bacteria which encode toxins honed to mediate interbacterial antagonism. Once transferred to eukaryotes tae genes confer novel antibacterial capabilities; this provides a selective advantage to the tick and to other eukaryotes also: tae genes have been transferred from bacteria to eukaryotes at least in six independent events. In particular, I. scapularis have inherited the dae 2 family from a common ancestor between ticks and mites. The product of dae2 expression has been shown to degrade bacterial peptidoglycan of different species and particularly from B. burgdorferi, but does not limit initial acquisition of the bacterium by the tick. Dae2 contributes to the innate ability of I. scapularis to control B. burgdorferi levels after its acquisition. This has potential ramifications for Lyme disease transmission, as spirochaete load in the tick can influence transmission efficiency. A recent study has identified the alpha-gal sugar in the tick, and they have suggested that it may also be involved in the onset of red meat allergy (Alpha-Gal Syndrome or Mammalian Meat Allergy).  Predators  Guineafowl, chickens, and fire ants are known predators of ticks. None has been proven to be effective in population controls on a large scale, but anecdotal evidence supports localized control.

As the tribe now looked to him to reclaim his title, he suggested his grandson assume the role. When the younger Mandela became chief in 2007, he was only 32 years old and most of his duties were said to involve tribal ceremonies, settling disputes among clan members, and representing the tribe on political issues. Career and education Mandela has been a member of parliament for the African National Congress since the 2009 election. Prior to both his succession to the chieftaincy and his election to parliament, he attended Waterford Kamhlaba, a United World College in Swaziland (now Eswatini), until 1995.  Personal life  His first wife is Tando Mabuna-Mandela. They married in June 2004 in a civil ceremony.‚ÄòNot my son,‚Äô says Mandla Mandela IOL She successfully filed for divorce in 2018, and the annulment of his other marriages. She claimed he is infertile. His second wife is Ana√Øs Grimaud, a French citizen born in 1990 in R√©union, who changed her name to Nkosikazi Nobubele. They married in March 2010 in a traditional ceremony. She gave birth in September 2011 to Qheya II Zanethemba Mandela, who was presented to his great grandfather Nelson Mandela at a naming ceremony in Qunu. In August 2012 he denied paternity, claiming it was the result of an affair with his brother.Ex gives shock support to Mandela paternity denial TimesMandla Mandela 'infertile', court told IOL His third wife is Mbali Makhathini (or, as she is otherwise styled, Nkosikazi Nodiyala Mandela), whom he married on 24 December 2011 at Mvezo. On 6 February 2016, he married his fourth wife, Raabia Clarke in an Islamic ceremony in Cape Town. Mandela converted to Islam about two months prior to the wedding, a requisite to marry into the Islamic community.  Controversy  Members of the Mandela family approached the Mthatha High Court in July 2013 to force Mandela to return the remains of three of Nelson Mandela's children to Qunu. Mandela had moved them to Mvezo, without consulting the Mandela family in 2011. The family also laid a criminal case of tampering with a grave. A South African High Court judge, Judge Lusindiso Phakade, ruled in favour of the complainants. He ordered Mandela to exhume and rebury the bodies at Qunu.

Biography He was born in Bishop Auckland in County Durham, England. He attended the local grammar school and, between 1918 and 1922, spent four years working for the borough surveyor. He then moved to Margate to work on the town's development plan, before working in Canterbury and London where he worked for the planning consultants Thomas Adams and Francis Longstreth Thompson. His next post was as regional planning assistant to the South West Lancashire Regional Advisory Group, but after credit for his lengthy report was given, as was traditional, to the honorary surveyor, he angrily resigned, and was unable to find work for two years. K. M. Stansfield, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Sharp used this enforced leisure to write Town and Countryside (1932), which established him as a formidable polemicist. He challenged the popular garden city movement, which sought to unite town and country, by insisting on their separate individual qualities. He finished the book in the family home in County Durham, an area which, with its contrasts between deprived coal mining areas and the fine architecture of the city of Durham, was a lifelong inspiration to him. As a consultant, he advised on the protection of the city from development that would compromise its environmental quality. Sharp loved the urban architecture of Renaissance and medieval towns. He thought the man- made landscape of England the most beautiful in the world and the English village as the perfection of the village idea. His thoughts in this area were expressed in English Panorama (1936), written after an unplanned move into the University of Durham's architectural department in Newcastle. Here also he edited the Shell Guide to Northumberland and Durham (1937) and produced his celebrated Town Planning (1940), a Pelican Book that sold 250,000 copies. Between 1941 and 1943 he worked in London, as a senior officer in the Ministry of Works and Planning, and made a major contribution to the Scott report which laid the foundations for post-war countryside protection. Sharp later wrote The Anatomy of the Village (1946), which became a classic on the subject of village design. His notions of townscape, then a novel concept, were perfected in his analyses of historic towns and cities ‚Äì notably Durham, Exeter, Oxford, Salisbury and Chichester ‚Äì for which he wrote development plans just before and then after the end of the war. After a brief return to Durham to set up the first undergraduate town planning course in the country, he returned to establish his own planning consultancy in Oxford, and was personally disappointed when Durham University failed to appoint him as its first chair of town planning. He became president of the Town Planning Institute in 1945‚Äì6, and of the Institute of Landscape Architects in 1949‚Äì51. He was appointed CBE in 1951. However, as a consultant based in Oxford, Sharp's inability to compromise made work hard to find. He spent much of his time on poems and novels, for the most part unpublished. His last planning book was Town and Townscape (1968). He married Rachel Dorothy Morrison in 1963; they had no children. She survived him following his death in Oxford in 1978, aged 76.

The executive producers were Juan Vera and Juan Pablo Galli, and it was produced by Adri√°n Suar. It stars Ricardo Dar√≠n, H√©ctor Alterio, Norma Aleandro, Eduardo Blanco and Natalia Verbeke.El hijo de la novia at the Internet Movie Database. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and won the Silver Condor for Best Film. Plot Rafael Belvedere's (Ricardo Dar√≠n) mother Norma (Norma Aleandro) suffers from Alzheimer's disease and he has not seen her in a year. Rafael sees his father Nino (H√©ctor Alterio) frequently but his friends rarely. He's fielding offers to sell the restaurant he runs in Buenos Aires, but changes his mind because it was started by his mother and father and has been in the family for years. His childhood friend Juan Carlos (Eduardo Blanco), who he has not seen for twenty years, drops by the restaurant and renews their old friendship, demonstrating the fact that he has become an actor. One day, Rafael suffers a heart attack and, as he recovers in the intensive care unit, he is forced to reevaluate his life and determine his priorities. He now wants to sell the restaurant and move to southern Mexico and raise horses. At the same time his father wants to remarry his wife because they were never married in the Catholic Church and she always wanted a church wedding. Rafael is opposed to the renewal of vows because his ailing mother will not be able to be much of a participant, due to her Alzheimer's. As part of his new life, he tells his much-younger girlfriend Nati that he wants some space and some freedom. At first she is hurt and tells him that he is no Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, or even Dick Watson (Rafael is puzzled about the identity of Dick Watson, and it becomes a running joke. The end credits make clear that it refers to a character in a porno film). Although Rafael tries to get her to understand his perspective, she breaks off their relationship. Rafael tries to deal with his struggles with this relationships and the fact that the Church cannot re-marry them due to canonical law, and he ends up selling the restaurant and having Juan Carlos act the role of a priest at his parents' second wedding. The film ends after the wedding, with Rafael opening a new restaurant‚Äîthe down-on-its-luck location across the street from the old Belvedere‚Äîand apologizing to Nati; she joyously forgives him. Juan Carlos takes a strong interest in Rafael's ex-wife and is shown pulling up a chair, inserting himself between her and her boyfriend, and chatting animatedly.

One, I suppose, is that there are different levels of reconciliation, in troubled families and beleaguered businesses as well as in nations beset by permanent crisis. A more important one, perhaps, is that there's a difference between dropping out and running away.\\"Stark, Jeff.

The Chinese reads \\"Japanese people not allowed to enter, disobey at your own risk.\\" Anti-Japanese sentiment in China is an issue with modern roots (post-1868). Modern anti- Japanese sentiment in China is often rooted in nationalist or historical conflict, particularly in Japan's history textbook controversies. Japan seized concessions in areas of China towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. Dissatisfaction with the settlement and the Twenty-One Demands by the Imperial Japanese government led to a severe boycott of Japanese products in China in 1915. Bitterness in China persists over the Second Sino-Japanese War and Japan's post-war actions. This sentiment may also be at least to some extent influenced by issues related to Chinese people in Japan. According to a 2017 BBC World Service Poll, mainland Chinese people hold the largest anti-Japanese sentiment in the world, with 75% of Chinese people viewing Japan's influence negatively, and 22% expressing a positive view. Anti-Japanese sentiment in China was at its highest in 2014 since the poll was first conducted in 2006 and was up 16 percent over the previous year. However, anti-Japanese sentiment significantly decreased by 2018; a poll done in 2018 by Genron NPO showed that 42.2% of Chinese people looked positively to Japan, up from 31.5% in 2017. Effects of World War II Most reasons for anti-Japanese sentiment in China can be directly traced to the Second Sino-Japanese War, which was one theatre of World War II. As a consequence of the war, China suffered 7 million to 16 million civilian deaths and 3 million military casualties.The real 'China threat' . Chalmers Johnson.The Looting of Asia. Chalmers Johnson. In addition, the war caused an estimated US$383.3 billion in damage and created 95 million refugees. Manchuria came under Japanese control in 1931 as a state named Manchukuo. Many major cities thereafter, including Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beijing were occupied in 1937 by the Japanese. Notable incidents included the Nanking Massacre. In Manchuria, Unit 731, a medical unit of the Japanese army, researched biological warfare using Chinese civilians as test subjects, who were referred to as human 'logs' in the medical journals. Women from many Asian countries, including China, were made to serve as prostitutes in military brothels (and were often referred to as \\"comfort women\\") under Japanese occupation. Postwar issues There is deep resentment over the veneration of Japanese war veterans in the Yasukuni Shrine, where a number of war criminals are enshrined, treated as kami or important spirits, and the fact that the shrine openly states that the purpose of Japanese military involvement in Asia was to bring prosperity and liberation to Asians. This is further exacerbated by attempts to whitewash Japan's role in the war in certain school history textbooks, such as by softening some statements and removing others. That some popular media such as comics, books, movies, or documentaries depicting Japanese wartime involvement in atrocities are withdrawn due to nationalist or popular sentiment further contributes to this image. As examples, critics point to the withdrawal of Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking from planned publication and the censorship of scenes of the Nanking Massacre from the Japanese theatrical release of The Last Emperor. China refused war reparations from Japan in the 1972 Joint Communiqu√©. Japan gave official development assistance (ODA), amounting to 3 trillion yen (US$30 billion). According to estimates, Japan accounts for more than 60 percent of China's ODA received. About 25 percent of the funding for all of China's infrastructure projects between 1994 and 1998 ‚Äî including roads, railways, telecom systems and harbours ‚Äî came from Japan. Japanese aid to China was rarely formally publicized to the Chinese people by the Chinese government, until Japan announced that aid was to be phased out. It was finally publicly acknowledged by Chinese premier Wen Jiabao during his April 2007 trip to Japan.Letter from China: Wen reveals himself as a new kind of Chinese leader, By Howard W. French, International Herald Tribune, April 19, 2007 There is a perception among some Chinese that the United States, Japan, and Taiwan are attempting to contain China. Japan's more recent debate to revise Article 9, the \\"No War\\" clause, is viewed with suspicion of possible re-militarization. Anti-Japanese sentiment in China is also highlighted by the branding of several prominent Taiwanese politicians (especially those who advocate for Taiwanese independence) as \\"Japanese running dogs\\" and hanjian (traitors) by the state-run media. Contemporary issues A sign in a Guangzhou restaurant reads \\"Japanese and dogs are forbidden here.\\" The phrase alludes to a sign in the Shanghai International Settlement which allegedly said \\"Chinese and dogs are forbidden here.\\" However the sign in Huangpu Park actually listed 10 regulations in English, the first being: \\"The Gardens are reserved for the Foreign Community\\", and the fourth being \\"Dogs and bicycles are not admitted\\".Robert A. Bickers and Jeffrey N. Wasserstrom. \\"Shanghai's 'Dogs and Chinese Not Admitted' Sign: Legend, History and Contemporary Symbol.\\" China Quarterly, no. 142 (1995): 444-66 Issues from the Second World War continue to generate ill-feeling in China. One issue is Japanese disposal of chemical weapons left in China by Japanese troops at the end of the war. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which came into effect in April 1997, and the Memorandum on the Destruction of Japanese Discarded Chemical Weapons in China, signed on 30 July 1999, required Japan to dispose of an estimated 700,000 abandoned chemical weapons (Japanese estimate). Japan was unable to complete the work on time and requested a five-year extension. Chinese plaintiffs suing the Japanese government over accidents caused by the unearthing of poison gas have had difficulty gaining satisfaction from Japanese courts. Forty-three people who were injured in a 2003 accident and five relatives of one who died have been unsuccessful in their claim for 1.43 billion yen (US$11.8 million; ‚Ç¨9.1 million), as well as for medical costs and loss of income due to health problems. Such issues continue to cause ill-will. On March 13, 2007, the Tokyo High Court upheld a lower court ruling and rejected compensation claims from four Chinese people who were injured and one whose relative died from being exposed to chemical weapons abandoned by Imperial Japan in China at the end of the war. Presiding Judge Hiromitsu Okita said the Japanese government was not liable for death or injury from the weapons, saying it could not have conducted a proper search for weapons in another country. The plaintiffs had sought a combined 80 million yen from the Japanese government. The court said the state was not obligated to conduct a search or to pay damages \\"because it cannot be said that the defendants could have prevented the outcome\\" of the death and injuries in the case, according to Japan Times. There were at least 700,000 pieces of chemical weapons Japan buried in China with site information destroyed by Japanese military according to Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Such lawsuits have been filed before,Chinese victims of Japanese chemical weapon sue Japan's government - International Herald Tribune but Japanese courts have rejected most claims filed by individual WWII war crime victims.ZNet Japan  Japan's Top Court Poised to Kill Lawsuits by Chinese War Victims In March 2007, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sparked a row over \\"comfort women.\\" A group of about 120 lawmakers from Abe's governing party want the prime minister to revise the official apology. The lawmakers claim there is no evidence to suggest the Japanese military was directly involved in coercing the women. They said they would present the government with a petition next week demanding a rewrite of the apology, which they consider a stain on Japan's national honor. Abe told reporters in his Tokyo office that he shared the belief that there was no direct proof of the military's involvement. \\"The fact is, there is no evidence to prove there was coercion,\\" he said according to LA Times. Abe said the government would cooperate with a study to be conducted by a group of Liberal Democratic party MPs who are sceptical of claims that thousands of Asian women were forced to work in Japanese military brothels before and during the Second World War according to Guardian. After the condemnation around the world, Abe made a qualified apology, saying \\"I express my sympathy for the hardships they suffered and offer my apology for the situation they found themselves in.\\" Abe told the legislature when pressed on what he would say to the aging survivors of the \\"comfort women\\" system: \\"As the prime minister, I am apologizing here\\" according to LA Times. Continued visits by Japanese politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine, and the recent approval of a textbook that downplays the Nanking Massacre and the role of sex slaves in the Imperial Japanese Army have further aroused Chinese sentiment. Japan's campaign to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council has met with stiff opposition among Chinese people. The Diaoyu Islands / Senkaku Islands, currently controlled and claimed by Japan, but claimed by both PRC and ROC, continue to be a sticking point and a symbolic focus of anti-Japanese sentiment in China. The buildup of anti- Japanese sentiment, aided by websites, had been noted by Western media in early 2005. In spring 2005, anti-Japanese demonstrations were organized by anti-Japanese elements in several cities across China. The Internet, including instant messaging services, was used in organizing groups of demonstrators to take part in protests. Many were calling for a boycott of Japanese products. The result was an apology by the Japanese PM. Concern at anti-Japanese sentiment is believed to be behind the decision of Chinese censors to ban the film Memoirs of a Geisha on February 1, 2006. The fact that Chinese actresses played Japanese geisha, often wrongly perceived as prostitutes in China, had caused considerable controversy among some elements of the Chinese population. There have been several reports that stores, restaurants, public institutions and hospitals in China refuse to serve Japanese customers because Japan has not apologized for the invasion of China.\\"Êµ∑Âçó‰∏ÄÂåªÈô¢ÊåÇÁâåÁß∞‚ÄúÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫Êãí‰∏çËÆ§ÁΩ™Á¶ÅÊ≠¢ÂÖ•ÂÜÖ\\" ‚Äù (ÂçóÊñπÈÉΩÂ∏ÇÊä•, July 15, 2005)\\"Ê∑±„Çª„É≥„ÅÆ„Éê„Éº„Åß „ÄåÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÂÖ•Â∫ó„ÅäÊñ≠„Çä„Äç\\" (‰∫∫Ê∞ëÁ∂≤Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÁâà, May 23, 2002) =Anti-Japanese sentiment at sporting events= Asian Cup 2004 During the Asian Cup 2004, an association football championship held in China, Chinese fans booed the Japanese team during the playing of the Japanese national anthem at matches against several countries, including China. Except for the match against Bahrain, Japanese supporters were instructed by the local police not to use \\"banners, flags, musical instruments, or wear team uniforms\\" and were asked to refrain from cheering. The flight to Beijing, the venue of the final match against China, was delayed for two hours due to Chinese protesters at Beijing International Airport. After defending champion Japan defeated China in the final by 3-1, a Chinese protest broke out, and the Japanese ambassador's car was severely damaged. 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup At the last game of Group A of 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup held in Hangzhou, tens of thousands of Chinese spectators in attendance cheered for the German team and booed the Japanese team vehemently. Japan was defeated by Germany and knocked out of the tournament prematurely. The Japanese players later held up a banner to thank China (\\"Arigato Ë¨ùË¨ù (Xie Xie) China\\") at the end of the game while the audience applauded in response. The incident caused minor controversy in China over the Chinese nationalism and anti-Japanese sentiment displayed at the game. The game was originally planned to be held on September 18 when Mukden Incident occurred. Because of the sensitive nature of the date in China, it was held one day earlier. East Asian Cup 2008 During the East Asian Cup 2008, Chinese fans booed the Japanese team during the playing of the Japanese national anthem again, at the first match for the Japanese team with the North Korean national team in Chongqing on February 17. The attitude of Chinese fans had not improved despite police warnings before the game. After the match between the Japanese team and the Chinese national team on February 20, a small group of Chinese fans burnt the Japanese national flag and booed the Japanese team with the derogatory term, xi«éo R√¨bƒõn (Â∞èÊó•Êú¨, \\"puny Japanese\\"). =Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute= Chinese anti-Japan protest in Hong Kong in 2012 In 2012, the Japanese government decided to purchase the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands from a Japanese family. Riots broke out in most Chinese major cities, and Japanese-owned business were smashed. In Shenzhen, the rioting crowd tried to take over a government building, demanding the Chinese government to declare war with Japan. There were multiple reports where people who were using Japanese products were attacked in the public. There was a report that a man in Hainan Province was stabbed to death for saying that Japan may win if a war between China and Japan broke out. =Anti-Japanese film industry= Anti-Japanese sentiment can be seen in anti-Japanese war films produced and displayed in mainland China. More than 200 anti-Japanese films are made in China each year. In one situation involving a more moderate anti-Japanese war film, the government of China temporarily banned 2000's Devils on the Doorstep, partly because it depicted a Japanese soldier being friendly with Chinese villagers. Politics Some believe that anti-Japanese sentiment in China is partially the result of political manipulation by the Communist Party of China. Denials of Nanking massacre by some public officials in Japan Some in Japan have consistently denied the Nanking Massacre which has upset portions of the Chinese population. In May 1994, Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano called the Nanking Massacre a \\"fabrication\\". On June 19, 2007, a group of around 100 Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers again denounced the Nanking Massacre as a fabrication, arguing that there was no evidence to prove the allegations of mass killings by Japanese soldiers. They accused Beijing of using the alleged incident as a \\"political advertisement\\". On February 20, 2012, Takashi Kawamura, mayor of Nagoya, told a visiting delegation from Nanjing that the massacre \\"probably never happened\\". Two days later he defended his remarks, saying, \\"Even since I was a national Diet representative, I have said [repeatedly] there was no [Nanjing] massacre that resulted in murders of several hundred thousands of people.\\"Hongo, Jun, \\"Nagoya mayor won't budge on Nanjing remark\\", Japan Times, 23 February 2012, p. 2. On April 1, 2013, Kawamura said his position remained unchanged when the issue came up during an election debate. On February 24, 2012, Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara said that he also believes that the Nanking massacre never happened. He reportedly claims it would have been impossible to kill so many people in such a short period of time. He believes the actual death toll was 10,000. On February 3, 2014, Naoki Hyakuta, a member of the board of governors of Japan's public broadcasting company, NHK, was quoted as saying the massacre never occurred. He said that there were isolated incidents of brutality but no widespread atrocity, and criticized the Tokyo Trial's figure of 200,000.

Publications = What the Music Said: Black Popular Music and Black Public Culture (1998) = In this work Neal interprets the vast array of issues and overlapping instances that create black music and culture. This book argues that there are two separate worlds in which this type of blackness exists. The first is black music as it exists alone. Here it confines itself to black people and the \\"formal and informal institutions of the Black Public Sphere.\\" It sings in juke joints and travels around the Chitlin' Circuit separate from the (white) outside world. The other side of black culture Neal speaks of is the one that outsteps the Black Public Sphere and stretches into the mainstream. In the book he labels this as a \\"tumultuous marriage between black cultural production and mass consumerism-one in which black agency is largely subsumed by market interests.\\" From this standpoint, Neal fleshes out the issues and ramifications of such a problematic \\"marriage.\\" = Soul Babies: Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic (2002) = Using the term post-soul to \\"describe the political, social, and cultural experiences of the African-American community since the end of the civil rights movement and Black Power movement\\",Neal, Mark Anthony. Soul Babies: Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic. New York: Routledge, 2002, p. 3. Neal's Soul Babies explores the extent to which post- modernity can be applied to the African-American experience. Characterizing the black traditions of the civil rights era as modern, Neal argues that postmodern or post-soul expressions of blackness both borrow from black modern traditions and render these traditions dated and obsolete in the process of articulating their own identity. By illustrating both attributes that play into the new forms of blackness, Neal is capable of painting blackness to be more than one thing or another. Neal is able to play on familiar tropes that embody post soul blackness. Much of this articulation is based on what Neal calls \\"a sense of familiarity,\\" or the exploitation of familiar tropes of blackness in post-soul expressions that are meant to heighten the sense of fracture and difference of the contemporary narratives built around them.Neal, Soul Babies, p. 15. OutKast's song \\"Rosa Parks\\" exemplifies the aesthetic as the duo \\"bastardized\\" black history and culture, to create an alternative meaning.Neal, Soul Babies, p. 22. Neal also describes the contrast between the post-soul aesthetic and conventional black culture. Using Tupac Shakur and R. Kelly as examples of post-soul figures, Neal highlights the crass materialism as well as the complex black identities these artists represent as starkly different from older, more conventional black motifs. Furthermore, Neal explains the often confrontational nature by which post-soul figures are received by the more established and antiquated black community like the NAACP. Also central to the predominance of the post-soul aesthetic is its commodification of black culture into Rap albums and films. = Songs in the Keys of Black Life: A Rhythm and Blues Nation (2003) = This book Neal's analysis of R&B; as it functions in all facets of black life. In it he argues that Rhythm and Blues is more than a haphazard collection of love songs. Here he exhibits the genre as a type of catalogue for black life that expresses all of the joys, sacrifices, struggles, and contradictions involved in the history of black people. He discusses everything from Marvin Gaye, to Macy Gray to Black Entertainment Television; the later of which he charges with the promotion of hyper-sexualized, skewed views of black music. \\"Neal creates a dense, sensuous space for a critical cultured black perspective, what Soul Babies called the post-soul aesthetic in black America. He illustrates his thesis through the use of black vernacular forms to produce a voice that is both streetwise and scholarly ...Neal may be the first writer capable of developing groundbreaking ideas in the academy and getting a new sticker on his ghetto pass in one stroke.\\"‚ÄîThe Washington Post = New Black Man: Rethinking Black Masculinity (2005) = Neal identifies as a Feminist. His 2005 memoir New Black Man includes a letter to his feminist mentor, Masani Alexis DeVeaux. In the book he uses the term \\"NewBlackMan\\" to describe men who define their black manhood in gender-progressive terms. His thesis focuses on how the Strong Black Male narrative might be the most problematic issue facing the contemporary black man while the work itself chronicles his journey to becoming a black feminist male. Looking for Leroy: (Il)Legible Black Masculinities (2013) Here Neal analyzes the many ways in which black masculinity is constructed, reconstructed, read and misread in contemporary American culture. His thesis argues that black boy and men are bound by their legibility; their ability to be clearly stereotyped and placed into preset categories. This type of profiling divvies up black masculinity into something non-threatening enough for White America to accept and be at peace with. The illegible areas thus become unsettling. That which does not fit into say the thug or criminal category is incomprehensible and thus don't belong to black masculinity. Through looking at black male figures such as Jay Z, Luther Vandross and R. Kelly, Neal explores how varied representations of the black man are able to break the public antagonism against black male bodies.

He called himself Te Mihaia Hou, the New Messiah, and claimed to be Te Kooti Arikirangi'sTe Ara: Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki successor Hepetipa (Hephzibah) who would reclaim T≈´hoe land that had been lost to PƒÅkehƒÅ ownership. Rua's beliefs split the Ringat≈´ Church,Te Ara: MƒÅori prophetic movements ‚Äì ngƒÅ poropiti which Te Kooti had founded in around 1866/1868. In 1907 Rua formed a non-violent religious community at Maungap≈çhatu, the sacred mountain of NgƒÅi T≈´hoe, in the Urewera. By 1900, Maungap≈çhatu was one of the few areas that had not been investigated by the Native Land Court. The community, also known as New Jerusalem, included a farming co-operative and a savings bank. Many PƒÅkehƒÅ believed the community was subversive and saw Rua as a disruptive influence. In 1916 police mounted an armed expedition, arriving at Maungap≈çhatu on 2 April to arrest Rua for sedition. He was found not guilty on this charge but imprisoned for resisting arrest. Rua was released in April 1918 and returned to Maungap≈çhatu, the community was however in decline and by the early 1930s, most people had left to find work elsewhere. Rua moved on to Matahi in the eastern Bay of Plenty and lived there until his death in 1937. In September 2017, the government committed to pardon him as part of a treaty settlement. Early life Rua was born in 1869 at Maungap≈çhatu in the Urewera Country New Zealand. He was the posthumous son of Kenana Tumoana, who was killed at Makaretu in November 1868 while fighting for Te Kooti, and of Ngahiwi Te Rihi. Rua was a member of the Tamakaimoana hap≈´ of the T≈´hoe tribe and, although not a chief in his own right, was of high birth and could trace his descent from Potiki and Toroa of the Mataatua canoe. In 1887 Rua left Maungap≈çhatu to learn farming. He worked on sheep stations in the Gisborne and Bay of Plenty districts and was a member of a shearing gang on the East Coast. During this period he studied the Bible. In 1905 he returned to Maungap≈çhatu where he set himself up as a prophet of the New Testament type. Here he formed his new self-sufficient community at Maungap≈çhatu which he called the \\"New Jerusalem\\" with its eventual population of between 800 and 1000 followers.  The prophet at Maungap≈çhatu  Rua standing on the rock in the centre Te Kooti Arikirangi, the founder of the Ringatu religion, had predicted before he died that he would have successor. Rua's statement that he was the successor to Te Kooti was first announced through an experience that he underwent on Maungap≈çhatu, the sacred mountain of T≈´hoe. The oral narratives tell how Rua and his first wife, Pinepine Te Rika, were directed to climb the mountain by a supernatural apparition, later revealed to be the archangel Gabriel. There they were shown a hidden diamond, the guardian-stone of the land, whose bright light was shielded by Te Kooti's shawl. Rua, in his turn, covered it again to protect it. In some versions of the narrative Rua met both Whaitiri, the ancestress of T≈´hoe, and Christ on the mountain. Rua would soon claim to be the MƒÅori brother of Christ. The first of three periods of settlement at Maungap≈çhatu, Rua arrived at this isolated outpost as the winter set in. Those who were there can still remember the harshness of that first year: the potato crop failed and there were no pigs to be had. Tatu, one of the Riwaiti, had to go back to Te Whaiti to collect 6 sows to start their own breeding colony. At least 50 people died that winter, most of them children, from the inadequacy of the houses, an outbreak of typhoid which came from the valley camps, and a measles epidemic which devastated the community. Sometimes there was nothing to eat but huhu, and the coarse toi leaves, normally used only for clothing. But from this inauspicious beginning, the community struggled on to a first summer of great plenty. Two groups had come together to build 'te pa tapu o te atua', the sacred pƒÅ of the Lord, the T≈´hoe, about half the entire tribe, and the Whakatohea, who through confiscation were almost landless. To signify the union between these two Mataatua tribes, Rua constructed the house of the Lord, Hiruharama Hou, built with two gables. One side was for T≈´hoe and the other for Whakatohea.Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu (Judith Binney with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979. pages 45‚Äì56). Maungapohatu, city of the mist Rua claimed to be the new Christ, the son of Jehovah, and said that no one who joined him would die. He called himself Te Mihaia Hou, the New Messiah. Rua owed his power to the great skill with which he applied the scriptures to the day today events in the lives of those who believed in him. His prophetic sayings (nga kupu whakari) gave meaning to a harsh existence, and offered hope to the future. He attempted to create a new system of land ownership and land usage. He organised a strong communal basis in all the settlements he founded but also emphasised the concept of family ownership of property. He cast aside all traditional MƒÅori tapu practices and replaced them with new forms specifically associated with the faith in himself as the Promised Messiah. His followers vested their lands in Rua and he had these surveyed and sold back to them. The settlement was administered by the prophet's own parliament. He also formed a MƒÅori mining company to exploit the mineral resources of the Urewera. At the prophet's command, 5 miles of forest were cleared and a prosperous farming community grew up under his leadership. Rua acted as his people's banker and took tithes of all they earned. In return, he gave them a prosperity they had never before known. Hƒ´ona, the circular meeting house built in Maungapohatu Rua built a curious two-storied circular temple of worship at Maungap≈çhatu, called the Hƒ´ona (Zion) that also became his parliament from where the community affairs were administered. This circular meeting house, built in 1908, was decorated with a design of blue clubs and yellow diamonds, and stood within the inner sanctum of the pa. This was Rua's \\"Council Chamber and Court House\\" ‚Äì also known as \\"Rua's Temple\\". Rua thought it was modelled on the Jerusalem Temple (even though his chamber was not to be a place of worship), but the actual model was the present day Dome of the Rock on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a Muslim holy site and one of the most sacred of Islamic shrines. Its unique cylinder shape would make it one of a kind He grew his hair long and affected a bushy beard in the patriarchal tradition fashioned on the Jewish Nazirite. As his reading of the Bible appeared to prescribe seven wives, Rua kept to this number and immediately replaced any who died or ran away. In all he had 12 wives and over 70 children. From the King-ite tradition he inherited the idea that MƒÅori possessed a separate nationality, and this, together with the success of his community, aroused the jealousy of local chiefs and incurred the Government's enmity. Through his personal vision his messianic religion promised the return of MƒÅori lands and mana to MƒÅori, and the end of their subjection to pƒÅkehƒÅ rule. He wanted to remove the T≈´hoe people totally from European influence and induced many to sell all their stock and farming interests. Power By 1908 Rua's struggle for power had brought the T≈´hoe to the brink of civil war and the Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward intervened to curb the prophet's influence. The Government had organised a meeting in March 1908 at Ruatoki of all the T≈´hoe tribes in an attempt to sort out the political differences between the two main T≈´hoe factions, that of Rua Kenana and Numai Kereru, chief of the Ngatirongo and the main opponent among the T≈´hoe of Rua's Christian-Judaic religious movement. Rua and four of his wives Because conflict was expected, the New Zealand Prime Minister had decided to informally visit both parties before the conference. At a dramatic encounter with Sir Joseph Ward on the Whakatane beach front on 23 March 1908, Rua and Joseph Ward exchanged words. Rua, flanked by some of his wives and supporters while seated on a chair that had been borrowed from the pub, acknowledged Joseph Ward approaching. Ward addressed both parties publicly, asking for their assistance in reconciling the differences in the forthcoming meeting at Ruatoki. To Rua's followers Ward said that he could not accept all that Rua had asked for. In particular, his request for his supporters to be placed on the European electoral role (presumably because they were outnumbered in the Eastern Maori electorate) was unacceptable, for MƒÅori have \\"special representation of their own\\". To Rua's request to have a special MƒÅori government, he said, \\"I told Rua... that in New Zealand King Edward is king, and is represented here by his government or king. There can‚Äôt be two suns shining in the sky at the same time\\". Rua replied to Ward, \\"Yes, there is only one sun in the heavens, but it shines on one side ‚Äì the PƒÅkehƒÅ side ‚Äì and it darkens on the other\\".Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu (Judith Binney with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979. pages 45‚Äì56). Rua had become a political embarrassment, and there arose the need by the Government to make an example of this man widely seen as an agitator, hoping a crackdown would discourage other MƒÅori activists. The mainstream Anglican church encouraged the Government to suppress Rua Kenana. In 1907, the church passed a motion that supported \\"the recent action of the Government in the direction of the suppression of tohungism (traditional MƒÅori healing), and trusts that it may be possible for the Church to make more aggressive action among the tribes which are specifically affected by this evil.\\" Authorities saw Rua Kenana as a disruptive influence and targeted him with the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907, which banned traditional MƒÅori healers from using herbs and other healing methods which were part of their traditional medicine. The Tohunga Suppression Act was designed to neutralise powerful traditional MƒÅori leaders and tailor-made as a political weapon specifically against Rua Kenana and his movement of dissenting MƒÅori.A Return to the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907 ‚Äì [2001] VUWLRev 17; (2001) 32 VUWLR 437 As a result of a number of charges of obtaining alcohol in 1910, Rua was fined for sly grogging and, in 1915, served a short gaol sentence for a similar offence. On his release he resumed his sly grogging. Rua insisted that his people boycott military service, arguing it was immoral to fight for a PƒÅkehƒÅ King and Country given the injustice meted out on MƒÅori under the British crown. Rua said, \\"I have 1400 men here and I am not going to let any of them enlist or go to war. You have no king now. The King of England he is no good. He is beat. The Germans will win. Any money I have I will give to the Germans. The English are no good. They have two laws. One for the MƒÅori and one for the PƒÅkehƒÅ. When the Germans win I am going to be king here. I will be king of the MƒÅori and of the PƒÅkehƒÅ.\\"Sheehan, Mark (1989), MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ: Race Relations 1912‚Äì1980. MacMillan, New Zealand. This was taken by the establishment as sedition and finally gave the Government and Rua's detractors the incentive to intervene against Kenana and the Maungap≈çhatu community. Arrest Rua Kenana meets with New Zealand Prime Minister Joseph Ward on Whakatane Beach, 23 March 1908. During the First World War the New Zealand Government had concerns that Rua opposed T≈´hoe men enlisting for war, these concerns resulted in rumours that he openly supported Germany. The Government arrested Rua after a 1915 hahunga, a bone cleansing ceremony, where he allegedly supplied liquor without a licence. He was summoned to appear before a magistrate on 19 January 1916, Rua said he would appear at the February court session as he was busy harvesting cocksfoot grass but his non-appearance was deemed to be contempt of court and preparations began for an armed police expedition to arrest him. On 2 April 1916 a 70-strong, and heavily armed, police party arrived at Maungap≈çhatu to arrest him for sedition. Because Rua's village was so remote, the police had to take a lot of equipment and camped on the way. They moved like a small army with wagons and pack-horses, and included New Zealand Herald photographer Arthur Breckon. So as not to alert the Maungap≈çhatu village of their intention to spring an attack they did not wear their police uniforms till just before the raid. They were convinced that when they reached Maungap≈çhatu there would be an ambush. There was no violent resistance from Rua personally, but his supporters fought a brisk half-hour gun battle with the police in which two MƒÅori, including Rua's son Toko, were killed and two wounded. Four constables were also wounded. Rua was arrested and transported to Rotorua, his hair and beard removed. From Rotorua, with six other MƒÅori prisoners including Whatu, Rua was transferred to Auckland and sent directly to Mount Eden Prison. Rua was held, at first, on a nine months sentence imposed for the 1915 charges and now increased by his default of fines. After a trial on sedition which lasted 47 days, New Zealand's longest until 1977, he was found not guilty; but sentenced to one year's imprisonment for resisting the police.Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu (Judith Binney with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979), page 119-124) When he returned to the Urewera, the settlement at Maungap≈çhatu was broken, divided, and the lands overgrown and much of the community having relocated. The Presbyterian Mission under Rev. John Laughton had moved into Maungap≈çhatu and was teaching Presbyterian Christianity and PƒÅkehƒÅ value systems. This shocked Rua, as he had banned pƒÅkehƒÅ schools from the original community. The costs of defence at the various trials had ruined the community financially as it had to sell stock and land to meet the debt. The community was even ordered to pay the costs of the entire police operations and raid at Maungap≈çhatu . Even though the supreme court had found Rua's arrest illegal and a legal petition had been drafted to Parliament on 1 May 1917 on behalf of the Maungap≈çhatu people calling for a full public inquiry into the events of 2 April 1916, and the behaviour of the police there and later intimidating witnesses, no compensation was ever offered to Maungap≈çhatu.Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu (Judith Binney with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979, pages 131-132 Eventually Rua moved downstream to Matahi, a community he had founded on the Waimana River in the eastern Bay of Plenty in 1910, where he lived until his death on 20 February 1937. He was survived by five wives, nine sons, and 13 daughters. Belief in his divinity did not long survive him, however, as he failed to fulfill his promise to rise from the dead. Little now remains of Maungap≈çhatu, and his church (Te Wairua Tapu) boasts few followers. The Urewera Country is peaceful, a contrast to what it was in the days of the Prophet Rua. Pardon The governor-general, Dame Patsy Reddy gives royal assent to the Rua Kƒìnana Pardon Act 2019 at Maungap≈çhatu on 21 December 2019, while T≈´heitia Paki, the MƒÅori king, watches on In September 2017, the government committed to pardon him as part of a treaty settlement. The bill giving effect to the pardon was introduced to Parliament on 22 August 2019, received its third reading on 18 December 2019, and was given royal assent three days later by the governor-general, Dame Patsy Reddy, at Maungap≈çhatu.

In administrative matters, the Chief of Defence has the authority to form or disband any unit below brigade level and to make any necessary reorganization to the command structure of the Defence Forces, unless such changes have wide impacts on the Finnish society, on the finances of the state or on the personnel of the Defence Forces.Laki puolustusvoimista.

Louisiana, 391 U.S. 68 (1968), is a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. This decision deals primarily with the civil rights of illegitimate children, specifically in regards to their ability to sue on a deceased parent's behalf. It held that the right of recovery may not be denied merely because a person is the illegitimate child of the deceased because such a law would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Background Louise Levy was the mother of five children, all of them born out of wedlock. She cared for the children herself, maintaining with them a relationship much like any other \\"typical\\" household. After alleged malpractice by Levy's doctor at the Charity Hospital of Louisiana at New Orleans, Louise Levy died. The appellant, on behalf of Levy's children, sought damages for Levy's wrongful death as well as damages for an unsettled case that Levy had not lived to see settled. The Louisiana District Court dismissed the suit. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, citing Louisiana statute defining a \\"child\\" for the purposes of damage recovery as a legitimate child. As the children were born outside of marriage, the courts deemed that they had no standing to sue on Levy's behalf. The Court of Appeals also defended its affirmation, claiming that the law was sound because it furthered the government interest of maintaining morals and general welfare by discouraging bearing children out of wedlock. The Supreme Court of Louisiana denied certiorari, and the case was finally appealed to the US Supreme Court on constitutional grounds. Specifically, the appellant claimed that the Louisiana law violated the Fourteenth Amendment and so was invalid. Decision The 6-3 decision in favor of Levy's children was delivered on Monday, May 20, 1968. Justice Douglas wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice Warren and Associate Justices Brennan, White, Fortas, and Marshall. The Court stated that the children involved in the case were clearly \\"persons\\" under the Fourteenth Amendment, which entitled them to its full protection. The Court noted that while states enjoy substantial powers to make classifications, states are not permitted to classify in a way that constitutes \\"invidious discrimination against a particular class.\\" The objective nature of the \\"invidious discrimination\\" test was not clearly outlined, but the Court stated that the classifications states made had to be at least rational. The Court continued to note the deference historically given to the legislature regarding its ability to draft law. However, when basic civil rights are involved, the Court said that it freely struck down \\"invidious discrimination,\\" even laws with \\"history and tradition on [their] side.\\" One precedent cited was the decision the Court made in Brown v. Board of Education, a landmark case in American civil rights. In the case at hand, the Court attacked the inappropriateness of the Louisiana statute and considered that the children's legitimacy had no bearing on their relationship to their mother. The statute was declared unconstitutional, and the decision of the lower courts was reversed. Justice Harlan authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Black and Stewart.

A single instance of a web series program can be called an episode or \\"webisode\\", however the latter term is not often used. In general, web series can be watched on a range of platforms and devices, including desktop, laptop, tablets and smartphones. They can also be watched on television. In 2013, streaming video website Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, House of Cards, Arrested Development, and Hemlock Grove, earned nominations that year. As of 2016, there are a number of awards that have been established to award excellence in web series production, including the Streamys, Webbys, IAWTV, and Indie Series Awards; there are also several web series festivals, most notably in Los Angeles and Vancouver. Most major award ceremonies have also created web series and digital media award categories, including the Emmy Awards and the Canadian Screen Awards. History The Spot, or thespot.com, was the first episodic online story, and the first website to integrate photos, videos and what later became known as blogs into the story line. Created by Scott Zakarin in 1995, The Spot was likened to \\"Melrose Place-on- the-Web\\" and featured a rotating cast of attractive actors playing trendy and hip twenty somethings who rented rooms in a fabled southern California beach house called ‚ÄúThe Spot‚Äù, in Santa Monica, California. The site earned the title of Infoseek's ‚ÄúCool Site of the Year,‚Äù an award which later became the Webby. In that same year, Bullseye Art was one of the first web publishers to create animated webisodes. The first few webisodic content to come out of Bullseye Art included Porkchops, Internet the Animated Series and Rat Chicken. In 1998 Bullseye Art had a hit with Miss Muffy and the Muf Mob, which led to a development deal with MTV. Bullseye Art also created Space Dog which gained popularity on Atom Films. The original Bullseye Art content can be seen currently on the Magic Butter web network. 1998 was also the first year of the Stella Shorts, perhaps the first comedic live action web series, first seen on Heavy.com and Comedynet.com. In the early 2000s, the Japanese anime industry began broadcasting original net animation (ONA), a type of original video animation (OVA) series, on the Internet. Early examples of ONA series include Infinite Ryvius: Illusion (2000), Ajimu (2001), and Mahou Yuugi (2001). In 2003 Microsoft launched MSN Video, which featured the original web series Weird TV 2000 (from the creators of the syndicated television series, Weird TV). Weird TV 2000 featured dozens of shorts, comedy sketches and mini- documentaries produced exclusively for MSN Video. From 2003 to 2006, several independent web series began to achieve popularity, most notably Red vs. Blue (created by Rooster Teeth). The series was distributed independently using online portals YouTube and Revver, as well as the Rooster Teeth website, and acquired over 100 million views during its run. Sam Has 7 Friends, which ran in the summer and fall of 2006, was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award, and was temporarily removed from the Internet when it was acquired by Michael Eisner. In 2008, Bravo launched its first weekly web series called The Malan Show. It was about a New York City fashion designer named Malan Breton who was trying to become a successful independent designer.The Malan Show Bravo TV Index In 2009, the first web series festival was established, called the Los Angeles Web Series Festival. Production and distribution The rise in the popularity of the Internet and improvements the accessibility and affordability of high speed broadband and streaming video technology meant that producing and distributing a web series became a feasible alternative to \\"traditional\\" series production, which was formerly mostly done for broadcast and cable TV. In comparison with traditional TV series production, web series are less expensive to produce. This has allowed a wider range of creators to develop web series. As well, since web series are made available online, instead of being aired at a single preset time to specific regions, they enable producers to reach a potentially global audience who can access the shows 24 hours a day and seven days a week, at the time of their choosing. Moreover, in the 2010s, the rising affordability of tablets and smartphones and the rising ownership rates of these devices in industrialized nations means that web series are available to a wider range of potential viewers, including commuters, travellers and other people who are on the go. The emerging potential for success in web video has caught the eye of some of the top entertainment executives in America, including former Disney executive and current head of the Tornante Company, Michael Eisner. Eisner's Vuguru subdivision of Tornante partnered with Canadian media conglomerate Rogers Media on October 26, 2009, securing plans to produce over 30 new web shows a year. Rogers Media will help fund and distribute Vuguru's upcoming productions, solidifying a connection between traditional media and new media such as web series. Web series can be distributed directly from the producers' websites, through streaming services or via online video sharing websites . Web 2.0 A number of web series incorporate interactive Web 2.0 features on their producer's websites, the show website, or other online fora. These Web 2.0 features enable viewers and fans to post comments online about episodes and link or \\"tag\\" favorite shows, episodes or video clips. These activities help to build viewer and fan engagement. Some producers use social media and social networking websites for the promotion of their web series and seek new viewers. As well, some producers monitor social media and networking comments as a way to obtain fan feedback on their shows. Awards The Webby Awards, established in 1995, and the Indie Series Awards, established in 2009, recognize top web series in the comedy, drama, and reality TV categories. In 2009, the International Academy of Web Television was founded with the mission to organize and support the community of web television creators, actors, producers and executives. It administered the selection of winners for the Streamy Awards, (which awards web television and web series content,) in 2009 and 2010. Due to poor reception and execution from the 2010 Streamy Awards, the IAWTV decided to halt its production of the award ceremony. The IAWTV followed this decision by forming their own award presentation, the IAWTV Awards.

This metric is often called a bundle metric, or fibre metric. Definition If M is a topological manifold and : E ‚Üí M a vector bundle on M, then a metric on E is a bundle map k : E √óM E ‚Üí M √ó R from the fiber product of E with itself to the trivial bundle with fiber R such that the restriction of k to each fibre over M is a nondegenerate bilinear map of vector spaces.. Roughly speaking, k gives a kind of dot product (not necessarily symmetric or positive definite) on the vector space above each point of M, and these products vary smoothly over M. Properties Every vector bundle with paracompact base space can be equipped with a bundle metric. For a vector bundle of rank n, this follows from the bundle charts \\\\phi:\\\\pi^{-1}(U)\\\\to U\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^n: the bundle metric can be taken as the pullback of the inner product of a metric on \\\\mathbb{R}^n; for example, the orthonormal charts of Euclidean space. The structure group of such a metric is the orthogonal group O(n). Example: Riemann metric If M is a Riemannian manifold, and E is its tangent bundle TM, then the Riemannian metric gives a bundle metric, and vice versa. Example: on vertical bundles If the bundle :P ‚Üí M is a principal fiber bundle with group G, and G is a compact Lie group, then there exists an Ad(G)-invariant inner product k on the fibers, taken from the inner product on the corresponding compact Lie algebra. More precisely, there is a metric tensor k defined on the vertical bundle E = VP such that k is invariant under left-multiplication: :k(L_{g*}X, L_{g*}Y)=k(X,Y) for vertical vectors X, Y and Lg is left-multiplication by g along the fiber, and Lg* is the pushforward. That is, E is the vector bundle that consists of the vertical subspace of the tangent of the principal bundle. More generally, whenever one has a compact group with Haar measure Œº, and an arbitrary inner product h(X,Y) defined at the tangent space of some point in G, one can define an invariant metric simply by averaging over the entire group, i.e. by defining :k(X,Y)=\\\\int_G h(L_{g*} X, L_{g*} Y) d\\\\mu_g as the average. The above notion can be extended to the associated bundle P\\\\times_G V where V is a vector space transforming covariantly under some representation of G. In relation to Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theory If the base space M is also a metric space, with metric g, and the principal bundle is endowed with a connection form œâ, then *g+kœâ is a metric defined on the entire tangent bundle E = TP.David Bleecker, \\"Gauge Theory and Variational Principles\\" (1982) D. Reidel Publishing (See chapter 9) More precisely, one writes *g(X,Y) = g(*X, *Y) where * is the pushforward of the projection , and g is the metric tensor on the base space M. The expression kœâ should be understood as (kœâ)(X,Y) = k(œâ(X),œâ(Y)), with k the metric tensor on each fiber. Here, X and Y are elements of the tangent space TP. Observe that the lift *g vanishes on the vertical subspace TV (since * vanishes on vertical vectors), while kœâ vanishes on the horizontal subspace TH (since the horizontal subspace is defined as that part of the tangent space TP on which the connection œâ vanishes). Since the total tangent space of the bundle is a direct sum of the vertical and horizontal subspaces (that is, TP = TV ‚äï TH), this metric is well-defined on the entire bundle. This bundle metric underpins the generalized form of Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theory due to several interesting properties that it possesses. The scalar curvature derived from this metric is constant on each fiber, this follows from the Ad(G) invariance of the fiber metric k. The scalar curvature on the bundle can be decomposed into three distinct pieces: :RE = RM(g) + L(g, œâ) + RG(k) where RE is the scalar curvature on the bundle as a whole (obtained from the metric *g+kœâ above), and RM(g) is the scalar curvature on the base manifold M (the Lagrangian density of the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action), and L(g, œâ) is the Lagrangian density for the Yang‚ÄìMills action, and RG(k) is the scalar curvature on each fibre (obtained from the fiber metric k, and constant, due to the Ad(G)-invariance of the metric k). The arguments denote that RM(g) only depends on the metric g on the base manifold, but not œâ or k, and likewise, that RG(k) only depends on k, and not on g or œâ, and so-on.

It is commonly measured as a percentage of the number of encounters in which a patient with a condition received new or increased therapeutic treatment out of the total number of visits to a health care professional by the patient. A high percentage indicates that the health care provider is slow to treat a medical condition. A low percentage indicates that a provider is extremely quick in prescribing new treatment at the onset of any medical condition. Calculation There are two common methods used in calculating therapeutic inertia. For the following examples, consider that a patient has five visits with a health provider. In four of those visits, a condition is not controlled (such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol). In two of those visits, the provider made a change to the patient's treatment for the condition. In Dr. Okonofua's original paper, this patient's therapeutic inertia is calculated as \\\\frac{h}{v} - \\\\frac{c}{v} where h is the number of visits with an uncontrolled condition, c is the number of visits in which a change was made, and v is the total number of visits. Therefore, the patient's therapeutic inertia is \\\\frac{4}{5} - \\\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 = 40\\\\%. An alternative, which avoids consideration of visits where the condition was already controlled and the provider should not be expected to make a treatment change, is 1 - \\\\frac{c}{h}. Using the above example, there are 2 changes and 4 visits with an uncontrolled condition. The therapeutic inertia is 1 - \\\\frac{2}{4} = 0.5 = 50\\\\%. Reception Therapeutic inertia was devised as a metric for measuring treatment of hypertension. It has now become a standard metric for analysing treatment of many common comorbidities such as diabetesDiabetes care: therapeutic inertia in doctors and patients and hyperlipidemia.Getting Patients to Their Lipid Targets: A Practical Approach to Implementing Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Both feedback reporting processes and intervention studies aimed at reducing therapeutic inertia have been shown to increase control of hypertension,Is blood pressure control to less than 140/less than 90 mmHg in 50% of all hypertensive patients as good as we can do in the USA: or is this as good as it gets? diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

This is different from traditional safety strategies which rely on control of conditions and causes of an accident based either on the epidemiological analysis or as a result of investigation of individual past accidents. The concept of system safety is useful in demonstrating adequacy of technologies when difficulties are faced with probabilistic risk analysis. The underlying principle is one of synergy: a whole is more than sum of its parts. Systems-based approach to safety requires the application of scientific, technical and managerial skills to hazard identification, hazard analysis, and elimination, control, or management of hazards throughout the life-cycle of a system, program, project or an activity or a product. \\"Hazop\\" is one of several techniques available for identification of hazards. System approach A system is defined as a set or group of interacting, interrelated or interdependent elements or parts, that are organized and integrated to form a collective unity or a unified whole, to achieve a common objective. This definition lays emphasis on the interactions between the parts of a system and the external environment to perform a specific task or function in the context of an operational environment. This focus on interactions is to take a view on the expected or unexpected demands (inputs) that will be placed on the system and see whether necessary and sufficient resources are available to process the demands. These might take form of stresses. These stresses can be either expected, as part of normal operations, or unexpected, as part of unforeseen acts or conditions that produce beyond-normal (i.e., abnormal) stresses. This definition of a system, therefore, includes not only the product or the process but also the influences that the surrounding environment (including human interactions) may have on the product‚Äôs or process‚Äôs safety performance. Conversely, system safety also takes into account the effects of the system on its surrounding environment. Thus, a correct definition and management of interfaces becomes very important. Broader definitions of a system are the hardware, software, human systems integration, procedures and training. Therefore, system safety as part of the systems engineering process should systematically address all of these domains and areas in engineering and operations in a concerted fashion to prevent, eliminate and control hazards. A ‚Äúsystem\\", therefore, has implicit as well as explicit definition of boundaries to which the systematic process of hazard identification, hazard analysis and control is applied. The system can range in complexity from a manned spacecraft to an autonomous machine tool. The system safety concept helps the system designer(s) to model, analyse, gain awareness about, understand and eliminate the hazards, and apply controls to achieve an acceptable level of safety. Ineffective decision making in safety matters is regarded as the first step in the sequence of hazardous flow of events in the \\"Swiss cheese\\" model of accident causation. Communications regarding system risk have an important role to play in correcting risk perceptions by creating, analysing and understanding information model to show what factors create and control the hazardous process. For almost any system, product, or service, the most effective means of limiting product liability and accident risks is to implement an organized system safety function, beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing through to its development, fabrication, testing, production, use and ultimate disposal. The aim of the system safety concept is to gain assurance that a system and associated functionality behaves safely and is safe to operate. This assurance is necessary. Technological advances in the past have produced positive as well as negative effects. =Root cause analysis= A root cause analysis identifies the set of multiple causes that together might create a potential accident. Root cause techniques have been successfully borrowed from other disciplines and adapted to meet the needs of the system safety concept, most notably the tree structure from fault tree analysis, which was originally an engineering technique. The root cause analysis techniques can be categorised into two groups: a) tree techniques, and b) check list methods. There are several root causal analysis techniques, e.g. Management Oversight and Risk Tree (MORT) analysis.Entry for MORT on the FAA Human Factors Workbench Others are Event and Causal Factor Analysis (ECFA), Multilinear Events Sequencing, Sequentially Timed Events Plotting Procedure, and Savannah River Plant Root Cause Analysis System. Use in other fields =Safety engineering= Safety engineering describes some methods used in nuclear and other industries. Traditional safety engineering techniques are focused on the consequences of human error and do not investigate the causes or reasons for the occurrence of human error. System safety concept can be applied to this traditional field to help identify the set of conditions for safe operation of the system. Modern and more complex systems in military and NASA with computer application and controls require functional hazard analyses and a set of detailed specifications at all levels that address safety attributes to be inherent in the design. The process following a system safety program plan, preliminary hazard analyses, functional hazard assessments and system safety assessments are to produce evidence based documentation that will drive safety systems that are certifiable and that will hold up in litigation. The primary focus of any system safety plan, hazard analysis and safety assessment is to implement a comprehensive process to systematically predict or identify the operational behavior of any safety-critical failure condition or fault condition or human error that could lead to a hazard and potential mishap. This is used to influence requirements to drive control strategies and safety attributes in the form of safety design features or safety devices to prevent, eliminate and control (mitigation) safety risk. In the distant past hazards were the focus for very simple systems, but as technology and complexity advanced in the 1970s and 1980s more modern and effective methods and techniques were invented using holistic approaches. Modern system safety is comprehensive and is risk based, requirements based, functional based and criteria based with goal structured objectives to yield engineering evidence to verify safety functionality is deterministic and acceptable risk in the intended operating environment. Software intensive systems that command, control and monitor safety-critical functions require extensive software safety analyses to influence detail design requirements, especially in more autonomous or robotic systems with little or no operator intervention. Systems of systems, such as a modern military aircraft or fighting ship with multiple parts and systems with multiple integration, sensor fusion, networking and interoperable systems will require much partnering and coordination with multiple suppliers and vendors responsible for ensuring safety is a vital attribute planned in the overall system. =Weapon system safety= Weapon System Safety is an important application of the system safety field, due to the potentially destructive effects of a system failure or malfunction. A healthy skeptical attitude towards the system, when it is at the requirements definition and drawing- board stage, by conducting functional hazard analyses, would help in learning about the factors that create hazards and mitigations that control the hazards. A rigorous process is usually formally implemented as part of systems engineering to influence the design and improve the situation before the errors and faults weaken the system defences and cause accidents. Typically, weapons systems pertaining to ships, land vehicles, guided missiles and aircraft differ in hazards and effects; some are inherent, such as explosives, and some are created due to the specific operating environments (as in, for example, aircraft sustaining flight). In the military aircraft industry safety-critical functions are identified and the overall design architecture of hardware, software and human systems integration are thoroughly analyzed and explicit safety requirements are derived and specified during proven hazard analysis process to establish safeguards to ensure essential functions are not lost or function correctly in a predictable manner. Conducting comprehensive hazard analyses and determining credible faults, failure conditions, contributing influences and causal factors, that can contribute to or cause hazards, are an essentially part of the systems engineering process. Explicit safety requirements must be derived, developed, implemented, and verified with objective safety evidence and ample safety documentation showing due diligence. Highly complex software intensive systems with many complex interactions affecting safety-critical functions requires extensive planning, special know-how, use of analytical tools, accurate models, modern methods and proven techniques. Prevention of mishaps is the objective.

Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Ghazi's father Muhammad Abdullah Ghazi played a major role in recruiting and training Mujahideen, who were Muslims that were struggling in their religion. In 1998, Ghazi and his father met Osama bin Laden. Ghazi, when referring to these events, stated: \\"The meeting inspired me to work for the establishment of Islam.\\" Furthermore, he also recalled that at the end of the meeting, he picked up a glass from which Laden was drinking water and drank it. An amused bin Laden asked Ghazi, \\"why he did that?\\" To which Ghazi replied : \\"I drank from your glass so that Allah would make me a (great) warrior like you.\\" It's said that it's during this visit to bin Laden and Mullah Omar in Kandahar that Ghazi became radicalized and eschewed his former modernist outlook.Zahid Hussain, The Scorpion's Tail: The Relentless Rise of Islamic Militants in Pakistan-And How It Threatens America, Simon and Schuster (2010), p. 112 Assassination of father A week after Ghazi and his father returned from Kandahar, on Saturday 17 October 1998, Ghazi's father who had a routine every day whereby he would walk to his seminary (the Al Faridia University in Sector E-7 Of Islamabad) for giving lectures, At noon when he returned Abdul Aziz, his elder son, approached him and spoke to him. When Maulana approached his house, a man standing in front of the door walked towards him and pulled out a gun and opened fire until the magazine was empty, badly injuring Maulana. Afterwards, he fired at Abdul Aziz, who barely escaped death. The assassin escaped with the help of an accomplice waiting outside in a car. Maulana Abdullah died of his injuries on the way to the hospital. Abdul Rashid Ghazi lodged the FIR and the police investigated the case. After a relentless effort, a man was arrested and afterwards, during ID Parade, several eyewitnesses identified the assassin. However, he was released the next day without reason. Abdul Rashid Ghazi protested against the release and warned the police of legal action if the suspect was not arrested soon. With Ghazi increasing pressure on police, he was asked to withdraw the case or face the fate of his father. According to his friend, this was turning point in Ghazi's life, and he became disillusioned with the system. Post-2001 Abdul Rashid Ghazi first came on the scene in 2001, when the religious parties of the country announced an organization for the defense of Afghanistan against the American invasion. Abdul Rashid Ghazi pledged support for the Taliban against the Americans, criticizing Musharraf for his submissive attitude towards them and openly challenging his authority.Michelle Shephard (9 July 2007), \\"Mosque crisis highlights Pakistan's turmoil\\", The Star.

Death and legacy After negotiations allegedly failed, the military decided to take action. This began as Pakistan Army Special Forces (SF), Pakistan Army Rangers, and Special Service Group (SSG) stormed the mosque. Ghazi himself remained in seminary with a few students. He called for a safe way in which he would not be humiliated like his brother, but government denied his requests. The Pakistan Ministry of Interior reported that he was killed on 10 July 2007 during Operation Silence. A few days after his death, his famous saying \\"We can be martyred but we will not surrender\\" was featured as Quote of the Day on Time's website.

It also contains a narrow sector of central Moscow, extending north-east from Lubyanka Square within the boundaries of Myasnitskaya Square and Bolshaya Lubyanka Street. However, the famous KGB-FSB Lubyanka building technically belongs to Meshchansky District.

Peter and Paul, built to a draft by Tsar Peter the Great Krasnoye Selo (, lit. beautiful village), that gave it name to the district and Krasnoselskaya Street, existed since Middle Ages east of present-day Kazansky Rail Terminal. It was separated from Moscow by a swamp around extinct Olkhovets Creek; construction of dams on the creek created a large pond that occupied present-day site of Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal and smaller ponds downstream. In the 17th century, Russian military set up a fortified armoury west of the pond, on site of Leningradsky Rail Terminal, exceeding twenty hectares; it blew up during the 1812 fire of Moscow and was abandoned. Accounts of a royal palace placed north of the pond are, likely, not true,Sytin, p. 297 however, young tsar Peter I, who was raised in nearby Preobrazhenskoye, used to ride boats on the pond. 1852 map of Moscow's first rail terminal, present-day Leningradsky Rail Terminal, with roundhouse and yards, and the pond on Olkhovets Creek In 1851, the state completed the first mainline railroad from St. Petersburg to Moscow, and set up the extant terminal building, designed by Konstantin Thon, west of the pond. This remote site was chosen due to high costs of land in the city and fear of accidental fire. More railroads followed with Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal (1862, rebuilt in the 1900s by Fyodor Schechtel and expanded by Lev Kekushev), Kazansky Rail Terminal (1864, rebuilt in the 1910s by Alexey Shchusev and expanded after World War II), and the line leading to Kursky Rail Terminal (1870s) with its own station on an overpass. The pond was filled only in the 1900s, in line with Schectel's project. New terminals were inevitably encircled with rail yards, workshops, warehouses and connecting lines, thus over a half of Krasnoselsky District is now occupied by railroad facilities. In 1935, the first line of Moscow Metro reached Komsomolskaya Square; its service yard was placed east of Yaroslavsky Terminal. At the same time Commissariat of Railroads took over the lands between the terminals and Garden Ring and set up an ambitious office construction program, starting with Ivan Fomin's constructivist \\"Tank Engine Building\\", which still houses the headquarters of Russian Railways. In 1947‚Äì1952, Railways acquired two skyscrapers‚Äîa mixed residential and office tower in Red Gates Square and Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya Hotel in Komsomoskaya Square. In the 1980s, the blocks north-west from these two towers were torn down and rebuilt with Leonid Brezhnev-era high-rise offices. Former Domnikovskaya Street in this office compound, widened to 8‚Äì10 lanes, is now named after Andrei Sakharov. Economy United Aircraft Corporation has its head office in the district.Home page.

As a General, he initially fought for the Royalist Army during the Independence Wars of Colombia, ultimately joining the revolutionary forces of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var towards the end, but once independence was attained he opposed Bol√≠var's Centralist government.  Personal life  Born out of wedlock to Ana Mar√≠a Crespo on August 8, 1795 in the town of G√ºeng√ºe, municipality of Corinto, in the then Province of Popay√°n of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in present-day Colombia,* Garc√≠a, G√ºeng√ºe, and Corinto are often quoted alternatively in various works as the city of birth, in practice however, the stratification of the place of birth points out to be the municipality of Corinto while the other places have no geopolitical status. Additionally, the Department of Cauca had not been established, and the Province of Popay√°n was the second-level political division of the Viceroyalty of the New Granada at the time. he was baptised Jos√© Mar√≠a Ram√≥n Iragorri Crespo just two days later on August 10 in the chapel of the Garc√≠a hacienda. Society, during the times of the colony, was puritanical and the religious authorities did not allow a single mother to raise a child on her own, thus when he was two years old he was given up for adoption and put in the care of a Criollo family in the home of Juan Luis Obando del Castillo y Fr√≠as and Antonia del Campo y L√≥pez who raised him as their own and gave him their last name. His parentage has been of debate among historians, most argue that he was the illegitimate son of Joseph Iragorri, but others argue and have tried to prove that his father was Pedro Vicente Mart√≠nez y Cabal, and others have claimed that he was the biological son of his adoptive father Juan Luis Obando as well. Despite his humble beginnings, Obando received a formal education in the Real Seminario de Popay√°n thanks to his adoptive family who were well-off merchants from Pasto loyal to the Spanish Empire and who consequently had to escape to Pasto after the Battle of Palac√© (1811) during the Wars of Independence. Obando married Dolores Espinosa de los Monteros Mesa in 1824 and together had five children: Jos√© Mar√≠a, Cornelia, Jos√© Dolores, Sim√≥n and Micaela, it would have been six since Mrs. Espinosa was pregnant with another child, but both died during childbirth in 1833 leaving him a widower with five small children at his charge. In 1837 he remarries to Timotea Carvajal Marulanda and of this union has three more children: Soledad, Capitolino and Gratiniano.  The Army and his rise to power  During the Wars of Independence the South was still very loyal to Spain, and specially Pasto were Obando joined the Royalists forces under General Sebasti√°n de la Calzada in 1819 in the rank of Captain fighting for the Spanish against the Revolutionary Forces who aimed to gain independence for New Granada from Spain. Nevertheless, on February 7, 1822, he resigns the Spanish cause and joins the Revolutionary Army and embarks in a successful military career. In 1826 he was appointed Civil and Military leader of Pasto by General Francisco de Paula Santander and was promoted to Colonel by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. In 1827 he resigned his post due to his discomfort with the political establishment which he labelled as undemocratic. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var dismissed the Convention of Oca√±a declared himself Dictator of the New Granada on August 27, 1828, and drafted a new constitution . The new constitution was centralist in nature, and Obando fiercely opposed this and in response launched a joint campaign with Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez, revolting in Timb√≠o against Governor Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera, a centralist and Bol√≠var supporter. Their forces then attacked Popay√°n on November 12, 1828 seizing the city and ensued to meet and defeated a nearby garrison in the Battle of La Ladera, securing the area and threatening the control of the government in the southwest region of the country forcing Bol√≠var to sign an armistice with them in order to secure peace. This armistice was favourable for Obando and L√≥pez, on October 8, 1829 Bol√≠var ascended Obando to the rank of General and designated him Commandant-General of the Department of Cauca. Bol√≠var's actions had angered more than just Obando, the level of opposition was such that he resigned in 1830 after surviving an assassination attempt by his political enemies in the north. The political vacuum and struggle for power left by his resignation led to a coup d'√©tat against the acting President Domingo Caycedo on September 5, 1830 by Venezuelan General Rafael Urdaneta. This new encroachment to the constitution spurred Obando to take action against the government once again, this time in defence of the government left by Bol√≠var. Obando convened the Assembly of Cauca in Buga on November 10, 1830 to speak out against the dictatorship and organize the armies to fight it. The makeshift military alliance commanded by Obando and Lop√©z strike on February 10, 1831 at the Battle of El Papayal in Palmira delivering a devastating blow to the dictatorship forces. From Palmira, Obando's forced moved to Cali, then to Neiva fighting the opposition. This conflict did not escalate further thanks to a compromise reached by Vicepresident Caycedo and Gen. Urdaneta, the Apulo Compromised secured a peaceful change of power with the compromised that key members of both sides would receive promotions. The Exaltados, as the faction which Obando belonged, were unhappy with the compromise as they wanted to purge the government and army from the Bolivarians, some of them even wanted to overthrow Caycedo once again and replace him with Obando, but his good friend Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez prevented them from doing so knowing that Obando, who fought the two previous unconstitutional grabs of power would be against it.  Vice presidency 1831‚Äì1832  Following the vacuum of power left by the resignation of Bol√≠var, the dissolution of the Gran Colombia, the struggle of power between Urdaneta and Caycedo, and the larger contention between federalists and Centralists, a National Constituent Assembly was convened on November 15, 1831 to draft a new constitution for the nation. Vice President Caycedo, who had been the Acting President after the resignation of Bol√≠var, proceeded to submit his resignation to the assembly on the same day it first convened; the assembly postponed the matter until it was decided whether or not to establish a provisional government. Finally the constituent assembly voted to implement a provisional government while a new constitution was drafted, for this purpose they elected Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando as Vice President, office which given the absence of a President made him the Acting President as well, and Obando was sworn in on November 23, 1831. As provisional acting president, Obando sanctioned on February 29, 1832 the Constitution of 1832 which among other things, changed the name of the country to Republic of the New Granada and implemented many of the Federalist ideals Obando championed. The Constituent Assembly also elected Santander as President while formal elections were carried out. Obando had once again been a candidate for Vice President this time around, but the objections of those who feared having a popular caudillo in power proved too much and the assembly voted to elect a civilian instead; on March 10, 1832 Jos√© Ignacio de M√°rquez was sworn in as the new Vice President succeeding Obando not only as Vice President but as acting President as well given that Santander was exiled in New York at the time of the election.  Return to Nari√±o  While the Constituent Assembly was drafting the constitution a conflict was developing in the south, the Congress of Ecuador had issued a Decree annexing the province of Cauca to their territory and sent in President Juan Jos√© Flores to enforce it. In response to Ecuador‚Äôs actions the Neogranadine assembly issued a decree of territorial integrity and dispatched General L√≥pez to keep Ecuador at bay. L√≥pez managed to secure the provinces of Choco and Popay√°n, but the provinces of Cauca and Buenaventura remained under the military control of Ecuador. Obando, who had stayed behind in Bogot√° as head of the provisional government was sent immediately by Vice President M√°rquez upon taking power to defend the territory, and once all the diplomatic options were exhausted, M√°rquez sent in reinforcements and support to aid Obando who was the commander of the 1st Army Division to take the Cauca by force. From Popay√°n Obando marched to Pasto with 1,500 soldiers and was able to take the Pasto with no struggle or conflict as the invading army had left in anticipation.  Election of 1837  The presidential election of 1837 stands in contrast to the pattern followed in 19th Century Latin America as the favoured candidate by the President and his administration was defeated. Santander had picked Obando for his strong military background over the popular civilians candidates like Jos√© Ignacio de M√°rquez, his Vice President, and Vicente Azuero. Many objected to Obando's candidacy because of his alleged role in the assassination of General Antonio Jose de Sucre, but Santander saw past that for he believed that the country was not yet ready for civilian rule and that Obando's military record cleared his name. In the election, which at the time were held indirectly, Obando received 536 votes falling short of the 616 received by M√°rquez but still enough votes that prevented M√°rquez to receive the required majority which forced the task of electing a President to Congress, unfortunately for Obando allegiances fell once the responsibility fell to the congress, some like General Mosquera who had initially lent his support to Obando flattered and voted for M√°rquez instead, it was the case that Congress was still made up of a lot of members who had been loyal to Bol√≠var and formed a bloc with the moderate liberals to elect M√°rquez to Presidency leaving Obando in defeat, also unusual in a circumstance like this was the peaceful transition of power, Obando admitted defeat and M√°rquez became President of New Granada that same year.  War of the Supremes  In 1839 Obando was thrust into a war of religious and political ramification that threatened to tear the country apart. The conflict began when Congress passed a law to suppress small convents and monasteries and re-appropriate the land in Pasto, the law was not intended to punish the Church as the places in question were indeed small and sparingly occupied by mostly Ecuadorian clergy, but the deeply Roman Catholic province went up in arms at the involvement of the government in their religious affairs, even after the Bishop of Popay√°n had approved of the measure. Obando who had returned to private life in his hacienda of Las Piedras near Pasto was divided on the issue as he was not pro-clergy but was torn on supporting his people. In Bogot√° the opposition party, made up of those who supported Santander, wanted President M√°rquez to appoint Obando to quell the uprisings, but he chose to appoint Generals Mosquera and Pedro Alc√°ntara Herr√°n instead. Obando tried to remain out of the conflict and moved to Bogot√° to prove his non-complicity. The tied turned for Obando when he was implicated in the assassination of Sucre after Herr√°n captured Jos√© Erazo, a guerrilla soldier that fought in Obando¬¥s division. According to Erazo, Obando had ordered him to carry out the assassination, and with his testimony a judge in Pasto issued an arrest warrant for Obando. The implications were largely believed to be political since Obando was the most likely candidate for the following presidential elections, and his enemies wanted him out of the race. Obando willing to clear his name traveled to Popay√°n to clear his name but it was clear that by then the conflict had become political and when he arrived to Popay√°n he led a short revolt against the government that quickly ended in an agreement with General Herr√°n and Obando continued on his way to Pasto. Once in his political and military stronghold, Obando entered in open rebellion declaring himself \\"Supreme Director of the War in Pasto, General in Chief of the Restoring Army, and Protector of the Religion of Christ Crucified\\", and calling for a revert to Federalism a popular and regionalist cause that was quickly picked up by supporters of Santander nationwide. Soon 12 out of the 20 provinces of New Granada were controlled by the Supremos, so called because they took up titles similar to Obando's calling themselves supreme directors of their region, 4 more provinces were partly occupied, and the government had trouble defending the remaining 4. From Santa Marta to Casanare to Pasto the Federalists were in control, but though large in numbers and support, they fought in separately so the army of the Supreme Director of Santa Marta fought his battles alone and not with the help of the Supreme Director of Antioquia. President M√°rquez desperate to take control went to recruit the help of Ecuadorian President Juan Jos√© Flores, an old enemy of Obando, to help him quell the rebellion in Pasto. The united forces of Generals Herr√°n, Mosquera and Flores defeated Obando at the Battle at Huilquipamba, delivering a devastating blow but providing the winners only a Pyrrhic victory, but with Obando defeated the rebel troops would not be able to unify under a single leader anymore.  Exile and return  With Obando defeated, the War of the Supremes quickly ended in favour of the government, Obando decided to go into exile and fled to Peru where he was welcomed by President Juan Cris√≥stomo Torrico, but when the latter was ousted by Juan Francisco de Vidal, the new administration gave in to the extradition request that New Granada put in through its Ambassador in Ecuador Rufino Cuervo y Barreto and its Ambassador in Peru Juan Antonio Pardo. Obando then escaped to Chile under the protection of President Manuel Bulnes Prieto. He remained in exile until January 1, 1849 when then President Mosquera gave amnesty to all those who committed political crimes. Obando returned to New Granada on March 13 of that same year and asked Mosquera to open a trial for him to be judged for his alleged involvement in the death of Sucre. Mosquera refused and the matter was passed to Congress where a proposed decree was introduced that allowed individuals to give up their immunity to stand trial. This resolution passed in the Chamber of Representatives but it was voted down in the Senate, where allies of Obando also voted to prevent this to happen fearing that he would be found guilty. In 1849 his good friend Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez was elected president of the New Granada ending the decade of Conservative rule. The new president appointed him Governor of the Province of Cartagena de Indias where Obando remained for little over a year returning to Bogot√° after being elected a Member of the Chamber of Representatives by the Province of Bogot√°, where he was able to revive his popularity and support and quickly rose to prominence becoming President of the Chamber in 1850.  Presidency 1853‚Äì1854  At the time of the presidential election of 1853 the then nascent Liberal Party was divided in three factions, the Radicals (the new social liberals), the \\"Golgothas\\" (the young progressive liberals), and the \\"Draconians\\" (the strict old liberal elite). The Radicals presented the candidature of Tom√°s de Herrera, a Panamanian General, the Golgothas choose Jos√© de Obald√≠a, and the Draconians presented that of Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando; the also emerging Conservative Party did not present a candidate for the election choosing rather to abstain from the election and not vote. Obando won the elections by 1,548 votes, and Congress appointed Herrera 1st Designate and Obald√≠a as Vice President. Obando was inaugurated on April 1, 1853 in the Cathedral of Bogot√° before the Congress Assembled becoming the 6th elected President of the Republic of the New Granada. The first order of business for President Obando was to sanction the Constitution of 1853 which had been introduced in 1851. Congress passed the new Constitution on May 16, and was sanctioned on May 21. The new constitution was unprecedented in Latin America and far too liberal for the nation at the time, in it federalism prevailed, slavery was abolished, suffrage was extended to all married men aged 21 and older, and the direct popular vote was implemented to elect governors, magistrates, congressmen and the president and vice president. Most shocking of all was the separation of church and state and the freedom of religion that it established, going as far as taking the juristic power held by the Church and subjecting its members to civil law. Obando a fervent Catholic whose political support stemmed from a region that had erupted in civil war just a few years back from closing a few convents was not happy to sign the new document. The Draconians, who had postulated Obando for president also wanted him to veto the constitution as they disagreed with its radical liberal nature which had been a product of the Golgothas. Nevertheless, Obando ratified it and it became the new constitution. = Coup = Bogot√° became the heated stage of conflicts between the artisan class and the merchant class. In 1853 a group of artisans had petitioned the government to increase import taxes to protect the national economy, they argued that many of these imports were goods that could be manufactured in the country. A bill was drawn up and passed the Chamber of Representatives, but the measure died in the Senate. An angry crowd gathered outside congress and a violent altercation erupted between artisans, merchants and politicians. The crowd was dispersed but the animosity between these groups only grew in the following months, different public events seemed to be a stage for confrontations between these groups which had come to be known as the ruanas (ponchos) who were the artisans, and the casacas (Frock coats) who were the well off merchant class. President Obando persuaded by those close to him sided with the ruanas, a move that destroyed his support in the capital among the elite and created animosity within his own party. Soon the talk of revolution was in the air, it seemed everyone in Bogot√° had different plans for revolution: reports that the Conservatives were going to revolt, that the Golothas were going to mount a coup, that the ruanas were going to overrun the city, and that the casacas were mounting an internal coup, all seemed to come from one place and another and even though preventive measures were taking the rumours only grew louder. President Obando, who had been informed of all the details of the rumoured plans dismissed them as baseless gossip; different leaders, among them Vice President Obald√≠a, informed President Obando that his General Commander of the Army of Cundinamarca, Jos√© Mar√≠a Melo would be the most likely culprit of the rebellion and that he needed to discharge him from the Army at once to prevent any future attack to government. Obando however, believed that doing so would disturb the public order, and that there was no proof of Melo's involvement in any of this. Obando's disbelief and inaction catalysed the events which occurred in the morning of April 17, 1854. General Melo arrived at his door and informed President Obando that he would mount a coup and invited him to suspend government and establish a provisional dictatorship to resolve the problems of the country. Obando baffled by the well announced and warned event that was taking place could not believe what was happening, he who after all had fought the dictatorships of Bol√≠var and Urdaneta, and who had fought against the regimes of M√°rquez, Herr√°n and Mosquera was now faced with the decision to become a dictator or a deposed president. President Obando declined him, and said he refused to take any power than that which was legitimately given to him by the people, and willingly and quietly accepted his fate to go down rather than to betray his convictions, thus a successful bloodless coup d'√©tat had been launched by Melo. Obando was taken prisoner along with most members of his cabinet and many congressmen, some were able to escape and took refuge in the Legation of the United States.  Post Presidency  In 1860 Obando was commissioned to suppress a revolution in Cauca, and died in defending the Federal system against the Centralists. He was killed with six spears in the back, four in his chest and a contusion in the head. When he was dead his upper lip was cut off by Sebast√≠an Tobar with a knife in order to remove his signature moustache. He was buried on May 1, 1861 in the Cemetery of Funza. He was survived by his second wife Timotea and his eight children. On August 19, 1869 his remains were exhumed and reburied in the family estate of El Empedradero in Popay√°n, and afterwards they were moved to the ossuary of the church of San Agust√≠n, where they remained until they were moved once again through the lobbying of Antonio Jos√© Lemos Guzm√°n to the Pantheon of the Forefathers (Pante√≥n de los Pr√≥ceres).

Brixius, Die Mitglieder des Kardinalkollegiums von 1130-1181, p. 95. Some later accounts, cited by Salvador Miranda, indicate that he died in 1153. was a German cardinal and papal legate of the 12th century. Biography Theodwin was Abbot of Gorze from 1126 to ca. 1133About the date of his promotion to the cardinalate see Wilhelm Bernhardi: Konrad III., Bd. 1, Leipzig 1883, p. 6 note 9, according to which his successor as abbot of Gorze is attested in 1133. and later was elevated to Cardinal as the Bishop of Santa Rufina, a position he held until his death. Theodwin participated in the papal elections of 1144 and 1145. He subscribed solemn papal privileges between June 7, 1135 and June 15, 1150. In 1147, as legate in Syria, he participated in the conference celebrated in Ptolema√Øs between Emperor Conrad III of Germany, King Louis VII of France, and King Baldwin of Jerusalem. Diplomacy with Germany Theodwin was the only German cardinal of his era. For that reason, he was especially influential in the Roman curia and was a close friend of Conrad III of Germany, whose election he supported in 1138.Bachmann, J. \\"Die p√§pstliche Legaten in Deutschland und Skandinavien (1125-1159).\\" Historische Studien 115 (Berlin, 1913). He was often the papal legate, or acting as such, in Germany. Prior to the Second Crusade, the church sent him to Germany in 1145 in an attempt to resolve some of the domestic political tensions there with the hope that a resolution would allow Germany to participate in the crusade.The Second Crusade: extending the frontiers of Christendom by Jonathan P. Phillips Later, during the Crusade, he served as the papal representative and travelled with Conrad. Relations with Sicily In the aftermath of the failed Crusade, when Conrad's reputation was at low ebb, Roger II of Sicily persuaded Theodwin to write to Conrad and convince him that Roger was an ally of the Crusaders. This was all part of an effort to break the alliance between the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire, against which Roger desired to make war.Rowe, John Gordon. \\"The Papacy and the Greeks (1122-1153) (Part II).\\" Church History, Vol. 28, No. 3. (Sep., 1959), pp 310-327. According to Abbot Suger, Godfrey, the Archbishop of Langres who was travelling with Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine, may have been an influence on Theodwin's writing. Theodwin's own apparent anti-Byzantinism, typical of the curia of the day, played no small part in affairs.Norwich, 144. The whole discourse, however, was conducted without the support of Pope Eugene III, whose politics were more moderate (and anti-Sicilian). Eugene even informed Wibald of Corvey that the opinion of Theodwin, and that of Bernard of Clairvaux, was not in line with papal thinking and was to be ignored.Rowe, 320. Death Some time after June 15, 1150On that date he subscribed a bull of Eugene III for the last time, see Johannes Baptista Gobatus, Bullarii ordinis S. Hieronymi congregationis B. Petri de Pisis, II, Padova 1775, p. 406-407. Brixius, p. 47, and Zenker, p. 26, being unaware of this document, say that he signed for the last time on April 14, 1150. Theodwin has been sent again as papal legate to the Holy Land, where he died,Zenker, p. 28 most probably on March 7, 1151.Cf. note 1, above However, some records suggest he participated in the 1153 papal election at which Pope Anastasius IV was elected.Florida International University - Theodwin; cf. above, note 1.

It was produced by and directed by S.U. Sunny for Wadia Movietone. It starred Dilip Kumar, Nargis, Jeevan, Rehman and Nur Jehan. The film's music was composed by Naushad. Mukesh gave playback for Dilip in this film and one of the \\"Mukesh hits\\" was \\"Gaye Ja Geet Milan Ke\\". Mohammed Rafi's voice was used just once, for the popular song \\"Ye Zindagi Ke Mele\\", set in a fairground and picturised on a wandering mendicant at the start of the film. The lyrics of the songs were written by Shakeel Badayuni with story and dialogue by Azam Bazidpuri. The musical film, set in a village milieu, was a tragic love story involving Manju and Mohan. Manju is married off to a seventy-year-old man, who declares that he didn't realise he was being married to someone so young. After the husband's death, the lovers meet and Manju dies accidentally. Mohan is convicted for her murder, and after spending twenty years in jail, he too falls off the cliff and dies when he follows Manju's spirit. Plot Manju (Nargis) lives in the village with her father, a school teacher, and step- mother. Mohan (Dilip Kumar) and Manju are friends since childhood. The friendship develops into love and they are both excited about their wedding. Mohan decides to go into town to buy jewelry for the marriage. On the way he is robbed and beaten unconscious, landing him in the hospital. Mehkoo (Jeevan), is a no-good man, retired from the army, who lusts after one of the young village girls. He is influential with Manju's stepmother and, with her by his side, calls the village panchayat. Here, he denounces Mohan as a cad who has run away with a girl, telling them that he won't return for the marriage. Since the wedding day has been fixed, the panchayat agrees with Mehkoo that Manju should get married on the day decided. It finds a supposedly suitable groom for Manju, but he turns out to be a seventy-year-old, sickly man. When he enters the wedding chamber, he agrees that Manju is too young to be his bride. Remorseful, he asks for forgiveness, but pleads with her to care of his children. Manju takes on the role of the old man's wife. The man dies, with Manju now left a young widow in charge of the children. One night in stormy weather, she goes out to meet Mohan, and dies when she falls off a cliff. Mehkoo and other villagers arrive to convict Mohan of murdering Manju. Mohan says nothing in his defense and is sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. On release from jail, Mohan goes to the same place where Manju had died. He sees her spirit, who beckons him to follow her. As he does, he falls off the cliff edge and dies. Cast * Dilip Kumar...

Manju * Jeevan... ex-army officer Mehkoo * Rehman * Amar * Roop Kamal * Alauddin * Abbas * Nurjehan * Chandabai * Khalil * Baby Zubeida Production The film, produced and directed by S. U. Sunny, was a Wadia Movietone presentation, with J. B. H. Wadia's wife Hila Wadia also listed in the credits as producer (\\"A Hila Wadia production\\"). Hila suggested that Jamshed Wadia make a film with music director Naushad, who was at the top of his musical career, having composed music for films like Rattan (1944), Anmol Ghadi (1946) and Shahjehan (1946). Following the success of Mela, Sunny set up his own production company, Sunny Art Productions, where he made films like Babul (1950), Udan Khatola (1955), and Kohinoor (1960). Dilip Kumar was reportedly unwilling to act in Mela until he reached the studios and heard the opening lines of the song \\"Mera dil todnewaale\\", sung by Mukesh and Shamshad Begum. Kumar felt the story line was weak, in his words \\"absence of meat\\", and asked the screenwriters to accommodate changes in the script, which they did. As Kumar reports in his autobiography, Dilip Kumar: The Substance and the Shadow, \\"We had some healthy brainstorming sessions, which helped us to add depth and intensity to the story besides [as well as] logic\\". He felt the changes were good, both for him and the cast overall. Review The film came in for harsh criticism from the editor of Filmindia, Baburao Patel. In the December 1948 issue of the cine-magazine, he compared the \\"formula\\" used for the story as a \\"rehash of Rattan\\" (1944). His review elaborated a Parsi (Wadia) and Muslim (Bazidpuri) \\"conspiracy\\" to \\"run down the Hindus\\" by making a \\"stupid and reactionary\\" film like Mela. Calling the film a \\"slander on Hindus\\" and anti- social, he claimed it to be a film encouraging suicide, a criminal offense (section 309 of the Indian Penal Code).Section 309, after years of controversial suits, was overturned in favor of suicide's mental-health causes with the 2017 passing of the Mental Healthcare Act. The army was slandered because the film made Mekhoo, an ex-army man, \\"the most objectionable character in the picture\\".NB: Mekhoo gives scanty details as to his having left the village, what jobs he had before the army, and the circumstances of his leaving; from that standpoint the army comes in for no slander. See the scene starting at 35m., where Mekhoo claims, in response to the question from Mohan's father, \\"Were you thrown out [of the army]?\\" that \\"No, I wasn't thrown out; people are let go after the war ended,\\" a clear attempt to fool the \\"backward\\" villagers. He found \\"unbelievable\\" features in the story, especially the quick arrangement for Manju's wedding without looking for Mohan, and that a seventy-year-old widower remarrying wouldn't know the age of the woman he's going to marry. Patel commended the film for its \\"pleasant photography\\". Patel praised lead-female Nargis, but in her role of mother found her \\"unconvincing\\" and \\"synthetic\\". Dilip Kumar as the hero \\"does his job well\\". For Jeevan, who played Mehkoo: \\"Jeevan plays Mehkoo and succeeds in creating disgust and revulsion, the two main aspects of his role\\". Later, Patel lays on more anti-Parsi rhetoric when comparing Mehkoo's sexual assault of a girl, Basanti, to \\"those of some of the toddy-tight [drunk] Parsis on vacation\\". Release and reception The film was released on 8 October 1948 at Excelsior cinema, Bombay. The music of the film was a main part in the commercial success at the box office, with it being reportedly referred to as Naushad's \\"Golden jubilee (fifty weeks) Mela\\". According to Meghnad Desai, a weak story was camouflaged by the \\"stunning melodies\\" in Mela and other films. The reported box office gross for the film according to IBOS was ‚Çπ. 50 lakhs in 1948. The adjusted gross as of 2015 is roughly estimated at ‚Çπ. 340.44 crores. Remake Chiranjeevulu (1956), a Telugu language film, was a remake of Mela. In the Telugu version, the hero is turned blind, and the old man who marries Manju is changed to a young bachelor, Dr. Krishna. The film was made under the Vinoda Productions banner, produced by D. L. Narayana (Dronamvajhala Lakshmi Narayana) and directed by Vedantam Raghavaiah. The dialogue writer and lyricist was Malladi Ramakrishna Sastry. The film starred N. T. Rama Rao, Jamuna, Gummadi Venkateswara Rao, Peketi Sivaram, C.S.R. Anjaneyulu. For actress Jamuna, it was cited as her \\"career-best performance\\"; Peketi Sivaram played the negative role of Mehkoo, originally played by Jeevan. The film \\"was a box office grosser\\". Soundtrack Composer Naushad had Shamshad Begum singing some memorable songs, in the process getting the \\"best out of Shamshad\\" for this film. \\"Dharti Ko Aakash Pukaare\\" and \\"Taqdeer Bani Banke Bigdi\\" by Shamshad are both notable songs, reportedly showing her growth as a \\"serious singer\\". The song \\"Dharti Ko Aakash Pukaare\\" was originally put in as a title song, but it became extremely popular, forcing the producers to have the full song added in the film. Another popular song was the bidai (farewell) number, \\"Gaaye Jaa Geet Milan Ke\\" (Sing Songs Of Meeting), sung by Mukesh, at the time of Manju's departure from home after marriage. It was used in the film to show Manju's feelings, her \\"secret sorrows\\" that \\"cannot be voiced but are palpable\\" through the medium of the song. The song is sung by Mohan (Dilip Kumar) as he's racing home in his bullock cart to meet Manju (Nargis), whereas Manju is leaving for her husband's home. Mohammed Rafi's popularity as a singer rose with the single song sung by him in Mela, \\"Ye zindgi ke mele\\".Vinod Kumar, Md. Rafi ke 51 Geeton Ki sargam: Song Sargam or Swarlipi Book (Notion Press, 2017). , 9781947697270 Mela had music directed by Naushad with lyrics by Shakeel Badayuni.

The purpose of putting a price on a ton of emitted is to aid policymakers or other legislators in evaluating whether a policy designed to curb climate change is justified. The social cost of carbon is a calculation to focus on taking corrective measures on climate change which can be deemed a form of market failure. An intuitive way of looking at this is as follows: if the price of carbon is $50 per tonne in 2030, and we currently have a technology that can reduce emissions by 1 million metric tonnes in 2030, then any investment amount below $50 million minus interests would make economic sense, while any amount over that would lead us to consider investing the money somewhere else, and paying to reduce emissions in 2030.  Calculating  Calculating the SCC requires estimating the residence time of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, along with estimating the impacts of climate change. The impact of the extra tonne of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere must then be converted to equivalent impacts on climate and human health, as measured by the amount of damage done and the cost to fix it. In economics, comparing impacts over time requires a discount rate. This rate determines the weight placed on impacts occurring at different times. Best estimates of the SCC come from Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) which predict the effects of climate change under various scenarios and allow for calculation of monetized damages. One of the most widely used IAMs is the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE). The DICE model, developed by William Nordhaus, makes provisions for the calculation of a social cost of carbon. The DICE model defines the SCC to be \\"equal to the economic impact of a unit of emissions in terms of t-period consumption as a num√©raire\\". The wide range of estimates is explained mostly by underlying uncertainties in the science of climate change (e.g., the climate sensitivity, which is a measure of the amount of global warming expected for a doubling in the atmospheric concentration of ), different choices of discount rate, different valuations of economic and non-economic impacts, treatment of equity, and how potential catastrophic impacts are estimated. = Discount rate = What discount rate to use is \\"consequential and contentious\\" because it defines the relative value of present costs and future damages, an inherently ethical and political judgment. A 2015 survey of 200 general economists found that most preferred a rate between 1% and 3%. Some, like Nordhaus, advocate for a discount rate that is pegged to current market interest rates, as we should treat efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions just like we treat any other economic activity. Others, like Stern, propose a much smaller discount rate because \\"normal\\" discount rates are skewed when applied over the time scales over which climate change acts. A 2015 survey of 1,100 economists who had published on climate change found that those who estimated discount rates preferred that they decline over time and that explicit ethical considerations be factored in.  Relationship to carbon tax  According to economic theory, if SCC estimates were complete and markets perfect, a carbon tax should be set equal to the SCC. Emission permits would also have a value equal to the SCC. In reality, however, markets are not perfect, SCC estimates are not complete, and externalities in the market are difficult to calculate accurately, resulting in an inaccurate carbon tax (Yohe et al.., 2007:823). The 2018 IPCC report suggested that a tax of hundreds or even thousands of dollars per ton would be needed to drive carbon emissions to zero.  Estimates  Recent large studies estimate the social cost of carbon as high as $417 tCO2 or as low as $54 tCO2. Both those studies subsume wide ranges; the latter is a meta-study whose source estimates range from -$13.36 to $2,386.91. Note that the costs derive not from the element carbon, but the molecule carbon dioxide. Each tonne of carbon dioxide consists of about 0.27 tonnes of carbon and 0.73 tonnes of oxygen.  Use in investment decisions  Organizations that take an integrated management approach are using the social cost of carbon to help evaluate investment decisions and guide long term planning in order to consider the full extent of how their operations impact society and the environment. By placing a value on carbon emissions, decision makers can use this value to expand upon traditional financial decision making tools and create new metrics for measuring the short and long term outcomes of their actions. This means taking the triple bottom line a step further and promotes an integrated bottom line (IBL) approach. Prioritizing an IBL approach begins with changing the way we think about traditional financial measurements as these do not take into consideration the full extent of the short and long term impacts of a decision or action. Instead, return on investment can be expanded to return on integration, internal rate of return can evolve into integrated rate of return and instead of focusing on net present value, companies can plan for integrated future value.  By country  The SCC is estimated to be high in India, China, Saudi Arabia and the United States. = United States = The SCC is claimed to be used in policymaking.  Criticism  The SCC has been criticized as being extremely uncertain, having to change over time and according to the level of emissions, and is claimed to be useless to policymakers as the Paris Agreement has a goal of 2¬∞C temperature rise. Calculating the SCC brings about a degree of uncertainty particularly due to unknown future economic growth and development as well as pending climate system response. Furthermore, the figures produced from the SCC cause calculations to be produced on a range with the most commonly utilized number being the central case value (an average over the entire data set at a given discount rate). The SCC is no longer used for policy appraisal in the UK or the EU.  History  The concept of a social cost of carbon was first mooted by the Reagan administration of the United States in 1981. Federal Agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation began to develop other forms of social cost calculations from Carbon during the George H.W Bush Administration. Furthermore, economic social cost from Carbon was judicially mandated in cost-benefit analysis for new policy in 2008 under the U.S. Court of Appeals. The year following in 2009 there was a call for a uniform calculation of social cost from carbon to be utilized by the government.

Roman writers regarded it as the original capital of Italy, before Lavinium assumed that role after the death of King Latinus. In historical times, Laurentum was united with Lavinium, and the name Lauro- Lavinium is sometimes used to refer to both.  History  According to Livy, in the 8th century BC at the time when Romulus and Titus Tatius jointly ruled Rome, the ambassadors of the Laurentes came to Rome but were beaten by Tatius' relatives. The Laurentes complained; however, Tatius accorded more weight to the influence of his relatives than to the injury done the Laurentes. When Tatius afterwards visited Lavinium to celebrate an anniversary sacrifice, he was slain in a tumult. Romulus declined to go to war and instead renewed the treaty between Rome and Lavinium.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:14 Under the Empire, Laurentum was the site of an imperial villa. Pliny the Younger may also have had a villa in the area.Pliny, Epistulae 1.9.  Etymology  The name \\"Laurentum\\" is either descended from many groves of Laurus nobilis (laurel trees), or, according to Virgil, a single \\"sacred\\" laurel tree. Laurentius (feminine Laurentia), meaning \\"someone from Laurentum\\" or \\"The one who wears a laurel wreath\\", was a common Roman given name. It survives in many regional forms, such as the Italian and Spanish name Lorenzo, the French name Laurent, the Romanian name Lauren»õiu, the Portuguese name Louren√ßo, the English name Lawrence, the Dutch name Laurens, the Polish name Wawrzyniec, and the Nordic and German Lars, Lauri and Laurits/Lauritz/Lavrans. According to Virgil's The Aeneid the city Laurentum and its people the Laurentines gained its name because the Laurel tree was Latinus' favourite.Virgil, The Aeneid, Published by Penguin Classics (1990) References Category:Roman sites in Lazio Category:Former populated places in Italy ","title":"Laurentum"},{"id":"10708684","text":"Marius Grinius is a Canadian foreign service officer and former soldier.

The Car-Nation roadster was an cyclecar costing $495. The vehicle had a four-cylinder Herreshoff \\"25\\" engine and a three-speed transmission. Car-Nation also manufactured a larger four-seat Tourer model with a base price of $520. They also advertised a fore-and-aft tandem; it's not known if more than a few prototypes were produced. Two roadsters and five touring cars are known to survive. In 1912, former Pope-Toledo manager Forrest Keeton moved his Keeton Towncar Works into a factory in Wyandotte, Michigan, a city south of Detroit on the shore of the Detroit River, and formed the Keeton Motor Company. He began construction of his first ‚ÄúFrench-like‚Äù car, the big Renault-influenced, air-cooled Keeton. It sold well enough to allow Keeton in 1913 to launch a second line of continental-influenced, low priced cars under a new name: Car-Nation. All that activity apparently attracted the attention of oil magnate Charles Schaeffer, and shortly after the introduction of the new car, the short-lived Car-Nation Motorette Co. and the existing Keeton Motor Co. unified under his ownership, reincorporating as the American Voiturette Company in Detroit. Slow acceptance of the Car-Nation's nonstandard gauge and reported problems with the Herreshoff engines in the Car-Nation sent the company into receivership in 1914. At a public auction in February 1915, Forest Keeton appears to have bought the assets of the company, including 60 Keetons and 350 Car-Nations, along with machine tools and countless thousands of parts.

He is specially fond of a girl whose name, incidentally, is Neena (played by baby Sarika), too. Unfortunately, the girl takes ill and dies. Jogi then returns to his village, Chandanpur, where he finds that the daughter of one of his villager friends, Baiju, has been abducted. He rushes someplace where she is about to be raped by the estate's cunning chief accountant, and he kills him to protect the girl. The villagers make up a phony story to save him, but he opts to tell the truth in the court and is jailed. There, he starts tending to the garden and composes philosophical poems. The doctor at the jail, Dr. Biren (Sanjeev Kumar) takes a special liking to him. Coincidentally, Neena, Jogi Thakur's daughter is set to be married with the doctor. Jogi Thakur finds this out by chance as he is tending to the garden outside doctor's room and overhears their conversations. He also learns that his daughter hates criminals. And so he shields his face from her on the few occasions that they meet. Unfortunately, he takes ill just as he is granted pardon by the government for his good behaviour. The doctor, has come to think of him as a father figure. He tells Jogi Thakur that the day he will be out of jail will be the eve of his marriage. Jogi Thakur is taken by the desire to see his daughter being wedded, and hurries to see her. However, he does not want anyone to recognize him. Finally he joins the beggars who have gathered for a treat for the marriage, where his daughter and son-in-law are serving food. He manages to give his blessings to her and hurries out. However, as he collapses on the road, he is recognized and people gather around him. The news reaches his daughter who rushes to the spot to meet with her father at his last moment. Adorned with such wonderful songs such as \\"Rail Gaadi\\" sung by Ashok Kumar himself, \\"Ek Tha Bachpan\\" by Lata Mangeshkar (sung by Jogi Thakur's daughter) and finally the memorable \\"Jeevan Se Lambe Hai Bandhu Yeh Jeevan Ke Raste\\" by Manna Dey (sung by the bullock- cart driver who carries Jogi Thakur near his village in the night), the movie is an emotional journey through a man's life who stands by his principles only to be finally overcome by love for his daughter.

Looking at the date of his last subscrpition of the papal bull and the fact that he is listed as participant in a papal election in December 1154, but not in that of 1159 (S.

Data density is increased by using a palette of 4 or 8 colors for the triangles, although HCCB also permits the use of black and white when necessary. It has been licensed by the ISAN International Agency for use in its International Standard Audiovisual Number standard, and serves as the basis for the Microsoft Tag mobile tagging application. The technology was created by Gavin Jancke, an engineering director at Microsoft Research. Quoted by BBC News in 2007, he said that HCCB was not intended to replace conventional barcodes. \\"'It's more of a 'partner' barcode', he said. 'The UPC barcodes will always be there. Ours is more of a niche barcode where you want to put a lot of information in a small space.'\\"  Technology  HCCB uses a grid of colored triangles to encode data. Depending on the target use, the grid size (total number of symbols), symbol density (the printed size of the triangles), and symbol count (number of colors used) can be varied. HCCB can use an eight-, four-, or two-color (black-and-white) palette. Microsoft claims that laboratory tests using standard off-the-shelf printers and scanners have yielded readable eight-color HCCBs equivalent to approximately 3,500 characters per square inch. Microsoft Tag Microsoft Tag logo indicating compatibility Microsoft Tag is a discontinued but still available implementation of High Capacity Color Barcode (HCCB) using 4 colors in a 5 x 10 grid. Additionally, the code works in monochrome.Hacking Microsoft Tag‚Äôs HCCB: works in monochrome too! Long Zheng. istartedsomething blog. 9 January 2009. Retrieved 2010-28-10 The print size can be varied to allow reasonable reading by a mobile camera phone; for example, a Tag on a real estate sign might be printed large enough to be read from a car driving by, whereas a Tag in a magazine could be smaller because the reader would likely be nearer. A Microsoft Tag is essentially a machine readable web link, analogous to a URL shortening link: when read, the Tag application sends the HCCB data to a Microsoft server, which then returns the publisher's intended URL. The Tag reader then directs the user's mobile browser to the appropriate website. Because of this redirection, Microsoft is also able to track users and provide Tag analytics to publishers. When the platform was released creation of tags for both commercial and noncommercial use was free, as were the associated analytics. In 2013, the process for creating new accounts was transferred to Scanbuy, which said that \\"A free plan will also be offered from ScanLife with the same basic features\\", although additional features may be available at extra cost. = Consumer = Users can download the free Microsoft Tag reader application to their Internet-capable mobile device with camera, launch the reader and read a tag using their phone‚Äôs camera. Depending on the scenario, this triggers the intended content to be displayed. Some GPS-equipped phones can, at the user's option, send coordinate data along with the HCCB data, allowing location-specific information to be returned (e.g. for a restaurant advertisement, a navigational map to the nearest location could be shown). = Application = The Microsoft Tag application gives people the ability to use a mobile phone's on-board camera to take a picture of a tag, and be directed to information in any form, such as text, vCard, URL, Online Photos, Online Video or contact details for the publisher. Two-dimensional tags can be used to transform traditional marketing media (for example, print advertising, billboards, packaging and merchandising in stores or on LCDs) into gateways for accessing information online. Tags can be applied as gateways from any type of media to an internet site or online media. The Microsoft Tag reader application is a free download for an Internet-capable mobile device with a camera. The Microsoft Tag reader is compatible with Internet-capable mobile devices, including many based on the Windows Phone 7, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry, Java, Android, Symbian S60, iPhone and Java ME platforms.A detailed list of all supported phones is available at http://www.microsoft.com/tag or the mobile phone site http://gettag.mobi . =Discontinuation= On August 19, 2013 Microsoft sent out an email notice that the Microsoft Tag service will be terminated in two years on August 19, 2015.

The term describes types of enclosures that may confine one or many animals. Construction and terminology vary depending on the region of the world, purpose, animal species to be confined, local materials used and tradition. Pen or penning as a verb refers to the act of confining animals in an enclosure. Australia and New Zealand In Australia and New Zealand a pen is a small enclosure for livestock (especially sheep or cattle), which is part of a larger construction, e.g. calf pen, forcing pen (or yard) in sheep or cattle yards, or a sweating pen or catching pen in a shearing shed. In Australia, a paddock may encompass a large, fenced grazing area of many acres, not to be confused with the American English use of paddock as interchangeable with corral or pen, describing smaller, confined areas. Britain In British English, a sheep pen is also called a folding, sheepfold or sheepcote. Modern shepherds more commonly use terms such as closing or confinement pen for small sheep pens. Most structures today referred to as sheepfolds are ancient dry stone semicircles. United States In the United States, the term pen usually describes outdoor small enclosures for holding animals. These may be for encasing livestock or pets that cannot be kept indoors. Pens may be named by their purpose, such as a holding pen, used for short-term confinement. A pen for cattle may also be called a corral, a term borrowed from the Spanish language. Groups of pens that are part of a larger complex may be called a stockyard, where a series of pens holds a large number of animals, or a feedlot, which is type of stockyard used to confine animals that are being fattened. A large pen for horses is called a paddock (Eastern USA) or a corral (Western USA). In some places an exhibition arena may be called a show pen. A small pen for horses (no more than 15‚Äì20 feet on any side) is only known as a pen if it lacks any roof or shelter, otherwise it is called a stall and is part of a stable. A large fenced grazing area of many acres is called a pasture, or, in some cases, rangeland. Other regions Primitive pens in South Africa are called kraal. Keddah is the term used in India for the enclosure constructed to entrap elephants, in Ceylon the word employed in the same meaning is corral. Exercise pen Folding portable wire exercise pen For pets, specialized folding fencing referred to as an exercise pen, x-pen, or ex pen, is used to surround an area, usually outdoors but not always, in which the animals can freely move around. They are commonly used for dogs, such as to give puppies or adult dogs more space than dog crates, but can also be used for rabbits and other animals. Exercise pens are usually made of sturdy wire, but can also be plastic or wood. Horses, during training, are often exercised in a round pen, sometimes referred to as an exercise pen. Pen mating Pen mating means that, ideally, a cohort of females is brought into the male's pen and he services them all while they are in the pen. This is the least labor-intensive mating system because the females are just left to mate at will. This mating is also the least efficient in terms of male power and efficiency as they do not need to do much in terms of exercising their power.thumb See also  *Pinfold and pound (village) are synonyms of animal pound *Bo√¥ *Kraal  References  * \\"Macquarie Dictionary, The\\", 2nd edition, 1991 External links Category:Agricultural buildings Category:Animal equipment Category:Livestock Category:Buildings and structures used to confine animals * Category:Livestock herding equipment an:Corral ","title":"Pen (enclosure)"},{"id":"10708962","text":"Bruce Bueno de Mesquita (; born November 24, 1946) is a political scientist, professor at New York University, and senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.

Fighting for independence  Group of Yoruk Ali Efe during Battle of Aydƒ±n On 15 May 1919, Greek forces captured ƒ∞zmir and immediately set out to occupy a larger territory in Turkey's Aegean Region. Y√∂ruk Ali organized meetings with the cooperation of other Efes in the region such as \\"\\" and grouped most zeybeks of Aydƒ±n region under his command. On 16 June 1919 he made a surprise attack on a Greek garrison based in Malga√ß train station. The garrison was completely destroyed and great amount of ammunition and supplies were captured. This was the first victory for the Turkish side in Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). Following a decision made in common by all Efes of Aydƒ±n, Y√∂r√ºk Ali and the zeybeks under his command attacked Aydƒ±n to recapture the town. On 30 June, his militias entered the city and held it for four days. But the reinforced Greek Army re- occupied the city on 4 June. Yoruk Ali continued the guerilla warfare against the Greek Army until his forces were enrolled within the ranks of the re- organized Turkish Army. In November 1920,Yoruk Ali Efe was assigned by the Turkish National Assembly to form a battalion under his command and was given the colonel's rank. His group voluntarily joined the Turkish Army under the appellation, \\"Aydƒ±n National Regiment\\" (\\"Milli Aydƒ±n Alayƒ±\\"). He served as a colonel in Turkish Army throughout the Turkish War of Independence.  After the war  He resigned from his office soon after the declaration of the Turkish Republic and lived in ƒ∞zmir for 6 years. In 1928 he moved to Yenipazar, where he lived until his death. His name became \\"Ali Efe Y√∂r√ºk\\" after the Surname Law, which was passed in 1934. He had lost his legs in a tragic accident in ƒ∞zmir when he had fallen under a tram. He died in Bursa, where he went for medical treatment, and was buried in Yenipazar in compliance with his will.  Legacy  Yoruk Ali Efe Museum in Yenipazar near Aydƒ±n. He was one of the last Zeybeks and remain as a notable Efe. His contributions to Turkish War of Independence and to the establishment of the Turkish Republic were also remarkable. He is also remembered with his generous personality and his fight for justice under all circumstances. After his death, his house in Yenipazar was converted to Yoruk Ali Efe Museum in 2001. His grave is in the garden of that museum.  Quotes  * \\"Some people believe that Turkish War of Independence was achieved by me and with some others. This is wrong. What can be the importance of one man or five men in such a great campaign? Any patriot who loved his motherland in those days had thought in the same way as ourselves, heard what we heard and then fought with us. It is a mistake to take the Lion's share in national resistance. How can one hand give a noise?\\"  Efe of all efes  Grave of Yoruk Ali Efe He is a hero in modern Turkish history and was given the name \\"Efelerin Efesi\\" (Efe of all Efes), whereas an Efe is already the leader of a group of zeybeks. There is a folk song (t√ºrk√º) written to his honour and carries his name. The lyrics of Y√∂r√ºk Ali's t√ºrk√º are as follows (with English translation):  ≈ûu Dalama'dan ge√ßtin mi, Soƒüuk da sular i√ßtin mi Efelerin i√ßinde Y√∂r√ºk de Ali'yi se√ßtin mi?

All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Retrieved 2019-04-11. As a rookie with the Minneapolis Millerettes Callaghan hit a .287 average in 111 games, for second in the league. She also finished third in total bases, hits, runs and stolen bases (112), while tying for third in home runs. By then, her older sister, Margaret, was the team's third basewoman. The Millerettes could not compete attendance-wise with the Minneapolis Millers, so the team moved in 1945, becoming the Fort Wayne Daisies. That year Callaghan had her best season, batting .299 to lead the AAGPBL. (The league average was .198 that year.) She tied for the league lead in homers (3), led in total bases (156), was second in steals (92), first in hits (122), second in runs (77) and first in doubles (17). Callaghan was often called the \\"Ted Williams of women's baseball\\". The league was not yet giving out Player of the Year or All-Star honors, but it is clear she was a candidate for both. Ft. Wayne finished second and advanced to the championship, but fell four games to one despite a .400 mark from the younger Callaghan. Callaghan slipped drastically in 1946, hitting just .213, even though league averages rose about 10 points. She still tied for third in steals with 114. After missing the 1947 season due to illness, she returned for part of 1948 after getting married and having her first child. However, that year she hit just .191 as a bench player. She finished her career with Kenosha in 1949 as Helen Candaele, bouncing back to a .251 mark, tied for seventh in the league. She was ninth in total bases (113), eighth in steals (65), sixth in doubles and tied for eighth in triples. In a five-season career, Callaghan was a .256 hitter (449-for-1756) with seven home runs and 117 runs batted in in 495 games, including 419 stolen bases, 299 runs, 44 doubles, 20 triples and 271 walks while striking out 220 times. Her on-base percentage was .355, while her slugging percentage was .315. Family Helen had five sons. Casey Candaele, played nine years with the Montreal Expos, Houston Astros and Cleveland Indians. Another son, Kelly Candaele, is a politician, filmmaker, teacher, and writer. He produced a PBS documentary special on the AAGPBL. After filmmaker Penny Marshall saw it, she was inspired to create the 1992 film A League of Their Own. Another son, Kerry Candaele, has directed the 2013 documentary \\"Following the Ninth\\", about the global influence of Beethoven's final symphony, and co-authored the book \\"Journeys With Beethoven\\". Another son, Rick Candaele, was the football coach at UC- Santa Barbara and Claremont McKenna College. Death and legacy Callaghan died of breast cancer in Santa Barbara, California on December 8, 1992, aged 69. In June 1998, all sixty-four Canadian women who played in the league were inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

S. Eliot (1888‚Äì1965), first published in September 1915 in Others: A Magazine of the New Verse. It was published again in March 1916 in Others: An Anthology of the New Verse, in February 1917 (without the epigraph) in The New Poetry: An Anthology, and finally in his 1917 collection of poems, Prufrock and Other Observations. The poem's title is widely seen to be derived from the novel of the same name by Henry James.Eliot, it can be noted, was not the only 20th- century poet to borrow James's title. William Carlos Williams also wrote a poem titled \\"Portrait of a Lady,\\" while Ezra Pound wrote a poem he called \\"Portrait d'une Femme.\\" The poem's epigraph is a famous quotation from Christopher Marlowe's play The Jew of Malta: \\"Thou hast committed - / Fornication: but that was in another country, / And besides, the wench is dead.\\" The poem is one of the two main Boston poems written by Eliot, the other being \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\". It shows upper class society of the time as something rather empty and forlorn. The main focus of the poem, however, is the speaker, who in his own depiction of this upper class lady as soulless and empty, reveals himself as the one who is truly callous and unfeeling. The poem tells the story of a failed friendship in three episodes, occurring over a period of ten months. In Part I, the speaker visits the Lady's apartment in December after going with her to a concert, reports her talk of friendship, and suggests that he prefers a more vigorous approach to life. In Part II, the Lady complains about her age, envies her visitor's youth, and says that April sunsets and memories of Paris reconcile her with life, \\"after all\\"; again, her visitor turns from her to the world of newspapers, sports and comics, though confessing that he also has moments of exquisite regret. In Part III the speaker takes his farewell from the Lady before going abroad; she wonders why they have not become friends, asks him to write to her and describes her melancholy, solitary fate; in the close the speaker thinks of the Lady possibly dying and questions his behavior towards her. Like many of Eliot's early poems, \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" shows heavy influence from Jules Laforgue.Dale, Peter, Poems of Jules Laforgue. Anvil Press, 1986. For example, in 'Another Complaint of my Lord Pierrot', Laforgue has the lines: While Eliot has the lines: References External links * Category:1915 poems Category:Poetry by T. S.

History Puerto Tejada was officially made a town on September 17, 1897 in Monte Oscuro (Dark Mountain), named after General Manuel Tejada Sanchez. During the 18th and 19th centuries there had been uprisings of both black slaves and free blacks in the general area, and maroons had established settlements in Monte Oscuro, which provided great cover because of its dense tropical vegetation. After the abolition of slavery in 1852 the former slaves and the maroons' descendants established themselves as organized communities forming family farms that produced coffee, corn, plantain, cassava and cacao. They were joined by settlers and colonists from Antioquia, Valle and the rest of Cauca. There was a thriving agricultural economy at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Its first inhabitants settled at the banks of the Palo and Paila rivers.

The novel received the BSFA Award. Plot introduction Teresa Simons is drawn to a quiet English seaside town in the aftermath of an apparently motiveless massacre by a gunman. Her husband, Andy Simons, who was an FBI agent like Teresa, had died in a similar outburst of violence in a small Texas town, on the exact same day. Similarities between the two incidents of spree violence (a term often used in the novel), apparently taking place at random, are shocking and inexplicable. Teresa finds she can come to terms with the senseless nature of the murders only by immersing herself in the world of virtual reality‚Äîto be precise, the American-built technology that allows her to enter into the frightening world of the Extremes simulations.  Plot summary  The Publishers Weekly review provided a concise plot summary: \\"On the same day, at the same time, that a man with a gun committed mass murder in Kingston City, Texas, another armed man did the same in the seaside resort town of Bulverton, England. FBI agent Teresa Simons, 43, lost her husband in Kingston City. Now she's visiting Bulverton to determine if the slayings were more than coincidence. Teresa's training included the virtual reality scenarios of ExEx (Extreme Experience), which reconstructs violent events and requires participants to get shot over and over until they learn the right way to fight back. The FBI uses ExEx for training; companies market it for entertainment. Teresa uses ExEx facilities in Bulverton to seek parallels between the two murder sprees. But the GunHo Corporation has a major ExEx investment in the Bulverton incident, and wants to thwart Teresa. Could ExEx's feedback loops have altered time and reality, affecting or even creating the paired killings? Teresa's discoveries horrify her, but propel her into action. She endures a barrage of carnage to find her way back to her love.\\" Booklist offered another summary: \\"FBI special agents Teresa Simon and her husband, Andy, have been trained in ExEx‚ÄîExtreme Experience‚Äîa kind of virtual reality enabling intelligence officers to relive scenes of carnage, murder, and brutality as they learn to save themselves. Andy is investigating the possibility of connecting killers with victims thought to be random, in the hope of becoming able to predict violent outbursts, when, ironically, he is killed by a crazed gunman on a shooting spree. Teresa takes a restorative trip to England, her birthplace, sojourning in Bulverton, a sleepy former resort town. There, she winds up investigating a mass murderer's shootings of her hotel's owners, the barmaid's husband, and many others on the very day of Andy's death. Thanks to a bourbon-induced haze, the line between reality and ExEx blurs for panicky Teresa, and suddenly she is \\"experiencing\\" the violence in Bulverton. Or was she dreaming? hallucinating? If not, who is controlling her ExEx experience?\\"  Critical reception  Publishers Weekly described the novel as a \\"forensic thriller with a strong science fictional element\\": \\"Priest (The Prestige) keeps one eye on his suspenseful plot, another on the SF angles that underpin it and a third, camera-eye on the real implications of worldwide instant communication, virtual reality and media-driven violence. If his lingo can get a bit thick (\\"It's the same thing, in algorithmic terms, as your basic what-the-hell symbolic adumbration\\"), his plot will keep most readers raptly amazed.\\" Booklist wrote, \\"This enthralling fantasy seems tailor-made for film, filled as it is with images blurring time and space.\\" Rich Horton, at SF Site, said, \\"The scenes in ExEx are well done, believable and scary, and comment on our fascination with violence ‚Äì and to some extent on our complicity with it ‚Äì subtly, without lecturing. The writing is excellent... Priest seems fascinated with reality and how our consciousness creates our reality, and as such could hardly be expected to resist the temptation presented by a subject such as extremely realistic VR simulations. His speculations here jump off the extrapolation track a bit, in my opinion, but they are fascinating, and the ending of this novel takes on a certain logic of its own. It's moving and interesting, and well constructed... I was left feeling a bit like I'd read two books: one about what a cover blurb calls \\"the pornography of violence\\" and how people react and adapt to it; and another about consensus reality, and how VR might expand or alter that reality. Both subjects are interesting, and I still found this an absorbing novel, one of the best of 1998.\\"  Awards & nominations The Extremes won the BSFA Award in 1998 for Best SF Novel, and was nominated for the 1999 Arthur C. Clarke Award. In the 2000 Locus Poll Award it ranked No. 23 Best SF Novel.

She received death threats that were consequently investigated by the police, and faced a lot of criticism, in parliament and especially on chat and blogging sites. This regardless of the fact that during her term, the Finnish immigration policy continued to tighten outside the EU directives. The critique Minister Thors faced subsequently led to a decision not to continue this ministerial position in Prime Minister Katainen's government, and immigration policy was returned under the Interior Minister's wings and EU policy was given to the new position of the Minister of European Affairs and Foreign Trade. From 20 August 2013 to 19 August 2016 she was at the position of OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities.

The origin of the name Serhel is Syriac, meaning \\"the elevated wall.\\" The town is known for its pine forest, which also has some oak trees, in addition to a number of springs, including the Spring of Seraal. At an elevation of approximately 2,600 feet, the village has views of the lower Kadisha valley to the east and from higher up in its pine forest a view of the Sahel down to the city of Tripoli and the Mediterranean Sea. Serhel is home to a number of caves, including the cave of Bint Al-Malak (\\"the kings daughter\\"), Al-Zwayyet cave, and Ain Al-Mghara cave. Religious sites in the village include the ancient Church of the Angel Michael, dating to 1893; the Grotto of Our Lady of Salvation; the Church of Saint Georges; the Church of Mar Sarkis and Bakhos; and the Church of Mar Challita. During the presidency of Suleiman Frangieh in the 1970s, a highway was built passing through the center of Serhel and linking Beirut and Shikka on the coast to Ehden and the Kadisha Gorge higher up on Mount Lebanon. The construction of this highway made the village of Serhel more accessible, and made possible the construction of a large hotel and spa, Le Tournant, on the outskirts of town.

It was founded by Anna T. Jeanes with help from Booker T. Washington in 1907.  About  The Jeanes Foundation supplied the structure and the method to hire teachers for African Americans in rural communities. Teachers in the program were called supervising industrial teachers, Jeanes supervisors, Jeanes agents, or Jeanes teachers. These teachers had a broad latitude to decide what areas to focus on in their individual communities. It was also understood that community needs were different and teachers' methods would vary. Supervising teachers also worked to raise money for schools, school equipment and to extend the teaching year. Supervising teachers were chosen by county superintendents.  History  The foundation was the idea of Anna T. Jeanes, an American philanthropist and Quaker who wanted to establish a fund to improve the educational opportunities of rural African-Americans. Jeanes had been in contact with Booker T. Washington and Hollis B. Frissell, principal of the Hampton Institute, who had discussed with her the importance of funding education for African-Americans. Jeanes was interested in providing assistance for people in rural areas, saying, \\"I should like to help the little country schools.\\" Jeanes asked Washington to help her set up a foundation for this purpose. Washington helped create a board of trustees for the program and Jeanes endowed the organization with $1,000,000 to create the Jeanes Foundation, also known as the Negro Rural School Fund or sometimes just Jeanes Fund which was incorporated on November 20, 1907. After Jeanes died, her will specified that William Howard Taft, Andrew Carnegie, Washington and Frissell be named to the Board of Trustees for the foundation. At the time, the Jeanes Foundation was the only educational foundation to have black members of the board. The president of the fund was James Hardy Dillard. The board first met on February 29, 1908. Soon, the board began to receive requests for funding from county superintendents of black schools. Jackson T. Davis, the superintendent of Henrico County Public Schools near Richmond, Virginia, requested funds for an \\"industrial supervisor\\" who would teach both vocational and academic skills at rural schools. In 1908, Davis, named Virginia Estelle Randolph as the first \\"Jeanes Supervising Industrial Teacher.\\" Randolph created the first program for the Jeanes teachers to improve education in their communities. As the overseer of 23 elementary schools in Henrico County, Randolph developed the first in-service training program for black teachers and worked on improving the curriculum of the schools. With the freedom to design her own agenda, she shaped industrial work and community self-help programs to meet specific needs of schools. She chronicled her progress by becoming the author of the Henrico Plan, which became a reference book for southern schools receiving assistance from the Jeanes Foundation, which became known as the Negro Rural School Fund. Randolph was paid $40.00 a month for her work. The Southern Education Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation, was created in 1937 from the Negro Rural School Fund, the John F. Slater Fund, the Peabody Education Fund, and the Virginia Randolph Fund. In the 1960s, the Jeanes teachers and their students were integrated into public schools. The program continued until 1968.

Texas, 379 U.S. 476 (1965), is a major decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. It stated in clear terms that, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment rules regarding search and seizure applied to state governments.. While this principle had been outlined in other cases, such as Mapp v. Ohio, this case added another level of constitutional consideration for the issuance of search warrants when articles of expression, protected by the First Amendment, are among the items to be taken. In effect, when a state issues a warrant that includes the order to seize books, it must accord the \\"most scrupulous exactitude\\" to the language of the Fourth Amendment. Background The petitioner, John William Stanford, Jr., operated a mail-order book business, \\"All Points of View\\", out of his private residence in San Antonio, Texas. On December 27, 1963, Texas law enforcement officers--several Bexar County deputies and two assistant attorneys generals--appeared at Stanford's home with a warrant to search the premises. This warrant had been issued by a local magistrate for the purpose of seizing any books, lists, receipts, pictures, or other such effects related to the Communist Party of Texas, an organization that had been declared unlawful by a piece of Texas legislation known as the \\"Suppression Act\\", also known as the Texas Communist Control Law. Among other provisions, the Suppression Act made it illegal to possess writings, recordings or photographs relating to the Communist Party of Texas, each instance of such possession potentially bringing a prison sentence of 20 years. Stanford was not home at the time officers arrived, but his wife allowed police into the home after being read the warrant. Officers evidently tried to locate Stanford without success before beginning their search. This search lasted around five hours. When the search was completed, officers had, in total, seized approximately 2,000 of Stanford's books, pamphlets, and papers, which were then packed into 14 cartons and sent to an investigator's office in the county courthouse. In the entire collection of seized material, investigators did not find any articles related to the Communist Party of Texas. Many of the seized books had been, in fact, intended for sale in Stanford's home business and included \\"such diverse writers as Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, Theodore Draper, Fidel Castro, Earl Browder, Pope John XXIII, and Mr. Justice Hugo Black.\\"Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. at 479. Also among the seized items was an array of Stanford's private documents, insurance policies, personal correspondence, and even his marriage certificate. Due to this fact, and the fact that the investigation had yielded no evidence of criminal activity, Stanford filed a motion with the magistrate who had issued the warrant, requesting that the warrant be annulled and his property be returned. After a hearing, Stanford's motion was denied without further comment from the court. By statute, the decision of the local court was final on this matter, leaving only the supreme court as an avenue of appeal. The court granted certiorari and heard arguments on November 12, 1964.Stanford v. Texas, Oyez (last visited Feb 7, 2017). John Stanford helped organize the San Antonio Committee to Free Angela Davis in the early 1970s and still lives in San Antonio. He was also active for many years in the peace movement and with black communist John Inman of San Antonio. Stanford established relationships with SNCC, the Black Panthers, and other groups active in the San Antonio area. Opinion of the Court On January 18, 1965, Justice Potter Stewart delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court. Demonstrating the strength of the agreement among the justices, the court stated that it would not even consider the majority of Stanford's arguments against the warrant, stating it needed just one of his objections to determine that the search had been unconstitutional. Namely, the court found the warrant issued was a general warrant, something that the Fourth Amendment had been created specifically to prevent. Such a warrant required only the reasonable belief of wrongdoing, and granted law enforcement officials considerable leeway in what they were allowed to seize as evidence of a crime. The court quoted Revolutionary War-era figure James Otis; regarding writs of assistance, Otis remarks, \\"[they are] the worst instrument of arbitrary power ... that ever was found in an English law book... [placing] the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.\\" Much of the court's opinion pertains to the history of warrants, and the constitutional interest in preventing warrants that are too broad in scope. Justice Stewart felt it would be a ‚Äúneedless exercise in pedantry to review again the detailed history of the use of general warrants as instruments of oppression from the time of the Tudors, through the Star Chamber, the Long Parliament, the Restoration, and beyond.‚ÄùStanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. at 482 fn.6 citing Siebert, Freedom of the Press in England, 1476-1776, pp. 83, 85-86, 97. Nevertheless, the Court's discussion of this history comprises more than half of the unquoted text of the opinion. Justice Steward focuses closely on the English Court of King‚Äôs Bench case Entick v Carrington (1765), which rejected a search warrant against a bookseller for seditious libel.Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. at 483 fn.10 citing Lasson, Development of the Fourth Amendment, p. 43. Calling Lord Camden‚Äôs opinion the ‚Äúwellspring‚Äù of the Fourth Amendment,Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. at 484 fn.13 citing Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886). Justice Steward draws the King‚Äôs overreach there in close parallel with Texas‚Äôs search of John Stanford here.Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. at 483 fn.11 citing Erskine May, Constitutional History of England 246 (Am. ed. 1864). Near the end of the Court's opinion, it summarizes its purpose in discussing history at such length: > In short, what this history indispensably teaches is that the constitutional > requirement that warrants must particularly describe the 'things to be > seized' is to be accorded the most scrupulous exactitude when the 'things' > are books, and the basis for their seizure is the ideas which they contain. The magistrate's order was vacated, and the case was remanded to lower court for its final disposition, consistent with the ruling above.

Overview  Map of the Eswatini Railways network As in the rest of Southern Africa, the rail system of Eswatini is built to the narrow Cape gauge of . ESR provides only service for transportation of goods, not passengers. ESR's rail system is used to connect the land-locked country to the sea. The east-west link, called the Goba line, leads from Matsapha (near Manzini) through Sidvokodvo, Phuzumoya and Mpaka to Goba in Mozambique. From Goba a Mozambique Ports and Railways line connects to the ports of Matola and Maputo. Swazi Rail also has two connections to South Africa: a northern link from Mpaka to Komatipoort in Mpumalanga on the Pretoria‚ÄìMaputo railway, and a southern link from Phuzumoya to Golela in KwaZulu-Natal, from where the Transnet network connects to the ports of Richards Bay and Durban. History In 1902 the British administration of Eswatini agreed with the Portuguese administration of Mozambique to construct a railway line from Louren√ßo Marques (now Maputo) to Eswatini. The Mozambican section as far as Goba was opened in 1905, but the line was not continued across the border. In 1927 the Zululand Railway in South Africa reached Golela on the southern border of Eswatini. The development of the Ngwenya Mine in the 1960s gave a new impulse to railway construction in Eswatini. Between 1961 and 1964, the east-west line was constructed from Goba to Matsapha and onwards to Ngwenya. Mining at Ngwenya ceased by 1980, and the railway beyond Matsapha was abandoned. The Mozambican War of Independence and the subsequent Mozambican Civil War caused disruption to Swazi trade through the Mozambican ports, and in 1977 the South African Railways agreed to the construction of a link from the railhead at Golela to the existing line at Phuzumoya. This line, opened in 1978, gave Eswatini rail access to Durban and Richards Bay. In 1986 the northern link from Komatipoort to Mpaka was opened, providing a shorter route for traffic from Phalaborwa and the Lowveld to Richards Bay.  Managed infrastructure  The company manages three main railway lines, the Goba railway, the Komatipoort railway and the Richards Bay railway. =Goba railway line= It is the main railway trunk in Eswatini. It serves as a link between the city of Matsapha and the city of Mlawula, allowing connection with the port of Maputo, already in the territory of Mozambique. =Komatipoort railway line= It serves as a connection between the cities of Komatipoort, in South Africa, and Mpaka, in Eswatini. =Richards Bay railway line= It serves as a connection between the cities of Richards Bay, in South Africa, and Siphofaneni/Phuzumoya, in Eswatini. Interconnection projects =Swazilink= In January 2012, the Swazilink project was announced, which would connect Sidvokodvo to Lothair in Mpumalanga in South Africa. This would divert freight traffic from the Richards Bay line and the Goba line. In June 2014, SR estimated that the link would cost R17 billion and could enter service in 2017.

C. Burnand based on Jean Fran√ßois Bayard's Le mari √† la campagne (The Husband in the Country), first produced in 1844 and produced in London in 1849 by Morris Barnett, adapted as The Serious Family. The story concerns the efforts of two aesthetic impostors to gain control of a family fortune by converting a man's wife and mother-in-law to follow aestheticism. He is so unhappy that he seeks the company of a widow in town. His friend, an American colonel, intervenes to persuade the wife to return to conventional behavior and obey her husband to restore domestic harmony, and the colonel marries the widow himself. The Colonel was first produced on 2 February 1881, and its initial run at the Prince of Wales's Theatre lasted for 550 performances, an extraordinary run in those days.Information about long runs in London Simultaneously, a second company was touring the British provinces with the play. On 4 October 1881, The Colonel received a command performance before Queen Victoria (the first play to do so in twenty years (since the death of Prince Albert in 1861).Denney, Colleen. At the Temple of Art: The Grosvenor Gallery, 1877-1890 (2000) Fairleigh Dickinson Univ. Press, p. 109 The play transferred to the Imperial Theatre in 1883 and then to the new Prince of Wales Theatre in 1884, built by the producer of The Colonel, Edgar Bruce, from the profits from the comedy's extraordinary success.Information on the history of the Prince of Wales Theatre In July 1887, there was a revival at the Comedy Theatre. Background Punch shortly after the premi√®re of Patience and The Colonel. The play, like the Bayard play on which it is based, follows a Tartuffe-type plot: a wealthy family is infiltrated by a religious impostor who threatens to gain control over the family fortune until an old friend comes to the rescue ‚Äî in this version, an American colonel, the title character of the play. A young husband generally uses the pretence of going to the country to escape his oppressive domestic circumstances. The old friend restores the husband's supremacy in his home by pointing out to the misguided wife the dangers inherent in suppressing innocent and fashionable pleasures in the name of an exaggerated devotion. Burnand's most important modification to this plot consisted in substituting \\"aesthetic\\" impostors for the religious hypocrites of the earlier versions ‚Äî a fake \\"professor of aesthetics\\" is pitted against the practical American colonel. Squire Bancroft, manager of the Haymarket Theatre had asked Burnand to create a new version of Bayard's story. Bancroft, however, decided not to stage the play, giving Burnand more license to freely adapt it. The \\"aesthetic craze,\\" was an obvious target for Burnand, who had been a regular contributor to Punch since 1863 and had become its editor in 1880 (a position he held until 1906). Beginning in the late 1870s, George du Maurier had published a long series of cartoons in the magazine satirizing the aesthetes.Introduction to The Colonel.

According to Burnand's memoir, Frederic Clay leaked the information to him that Gilbert and Sullivan were working on an \\"√¶sthetic subject\\", and so Burnand raced to produce the play before the operatic duo's Patience opened.Burnand, vol. 2, p. 165 Burnand was \\"one of the most prolific dramatic authors and burlesque writers ever known, nearly 200 works standing to his credit.\\"Who‚Äôs Who in the Theatre, 2nd ed., London: Pitman, 1914, p. 84 Roles and original cast Another Punch cartoon *Colonel Wootwell W.

It is a specification for an interactive on-demand multimedia satellite communication system formulated in 1999 by the DVB consortium. Chronology The 5th revision of the DVB-RCS standard was completed in 2008. A major update included the very first broadband mobile standardization. This extended version, formally referred to as \\"ETSI EN 301 790 v 1.5.1\\" is also known as \\"DVB-RCS+M\\". The \\"+M\\" version added several new features, such as the ability to use \\"DVB-S2\\" bursts in the uplink channel back to the satellite. It incorporated signal fade mitigation techniques and other solutions to combat short term signal loss. In contrast to other satellite communications systems, DVB-RCS was created in an open environment where any DVB member can participate. DVB membership is open to all companies willing to subscribe. The work group called \\"DVB TM-RCS\\" is currently pursuing other technical solutions for the approved commercial system. In 2009 technical work started for a new version of DVB-RCS called \\"DVB-RCS NG\\" (Next Generation). In this more powerful version of the standard \\"RCS2\\" there will be support for Higher Layers for Satellite (HLS) communication. = Evolution = In older systems, interactive video broadcasting was possible as a result of using physical cables for connectivity. However, in remote areas cable connections may be unavailable, two-way communication was then impossible via traditional means. One possible solution was to use a satellite linked connection for the return (uplink) channel in addition to the standard downlink channel. This option is more expensive to implement than with cabled connections in built-up areas, but may be more cost effective for remote areas where the costs of laying cable to users would not be recovered for a long time. Additional costs involved in RCS systems include the costs of a two-way satellite antenna and renting data bandwidth from a satellite communications provider. What is Rich Communication Services (RCS) = Advantages = DVB-RCS is a mature open source satellite communication standard with highly efficient bandwidth management. This make it a cost-efficient alternative solution for many users. It also provides an established foundation for further satellite communications research. = Hardware implementation = To implement this kind of communication, a user will require a device called a SIT, (Satellite Interactive Terminal, \\"astromodem\\" or satellite modem). A suitable satellite-dish is also required. Some systems are supplied as a pre-built combination. The user receives multimedia stream transmissions via the downlink-signals from the satellite. The user sends requests for service signals via the \\"SIT\\" and the uplink channel to the satellite. Upon receipt of the command from the user the satellite sends the user request data to the service provider. This takes about 0.5 seconds to connect each way with the satellite. (1 second total for satellite up and downlinks, and another second to the service provider and back, a total of 2 seconds Round-trip delay time). This technology can also be used for internet access via satellite. The downward route is from the service provider to the satellite, (via a standard uplink station), then via the downlink of the satellite to the users \\"SIT\\". Signal encoding uses phase-shift keying (QPSK or GMSK). The corresponding upward route is via the uplink- channel provided by the \\"SIT\\", data requests are transferred via the satellite to the service provider. The signal is then processed by a burst demodulator, (using the MF-TDMA protocol via the data scheduler). The data requested is then routed over the wired internet. The protocol used for the satellite-SIT portion of the journey is Multiple Frequency Time Division Multiple Access (MF-TDMA). Using this protocol, the user receives data in packets (bursts) that may not be a continuous stream, but when stored and rearranged will generate a virtual 2-dimensional data array. A scheduler is used to maintain these bursts and eliminate duplicates. This protocol is implemented in such a way that different users will receive varying amounts of packet bursts, this helps to regulate the data stream from the satellite-link according to user demands. = Standards = The standard that implements DVB-RCS is ETSI EN 301.790.

Nadler (born May 8, 1954) is Wallerstein Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies and Former Director of the Jewish Studies Program at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey. Biography Nadler was born in Montreal and was educated at McGill and Harvard University, where he received his doctorate in 1988. He was initially ordained as an Orthodox rabbi by Rabbi Aryeh Leib Baron (1911‚Äì2011) of Yeshiva Merkaz ha-Talmud in Montreal, and received a second ordination from the late rabbinical scholar, Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Tennenbaum, Chief Justice, or Dayan of the Orthodox Rabbinical Court of Justice (which authorizes the \\"KVH\\" Kosher Supervision) in Boston. He studied Talmud and Rabbinical Codes for two years in the Rabbinical Program at Jews' College in London, England, under the tutelage of Rabbi Dr. Nachum Rabinovitch, and also studied privately for five years with Montreal's Chief Rabbi Pinchas Hirschsprung. Nadler was the Rabbi of The Charles River Park Synagogues in Boston, at the time an ostensibly Orthodox congregation, with a mixed seating section, and was a member of the Boston Vaad HaRabonim, serving as a Dayan, or judge, on its Rabbinical Court from 1980‚Äì1982. During the period 1984‚Äì1992, Nadler became Rabbi of Congregation Shaar Hashomayim in Montreal, Quebec, Canada's oldest, most prestigious and largest Traditional Jewish congregation. Nadler was the first Orthodox-ordained rabbi at this formerly Conservative congregation, which left the Conservative Movement during his tenure. During that time he was adjunct professor of Jewish Studies at McGill University. After resigning from the Shaar Hashomayim, he served as Director of Research of the YIVO Institute in New York City (1992‚Äì1999), which holds the world's largest Yiddish and Holocaust Archives and Library. While at YIVO he served as Rabbi of the Fort Tryon Jewish Center in New York City, an independent Traditional synagogue, and was a visiting professor of Jewish Studies at New York University (1992‚Äì1995) and Cornell University (1995‚Äì1998). Also while at YIVO, Nadler led international Jewish efforts to repatriate libraries, archives and Torah scrolls in Lithuania that had been plundered and confiscated by the Nazis, and later held by Soviet authorities. His direct negotiations with then-President of Lithuania, Algirdas Brazauskas, led to the release in 1993, to the New York City offices of YIVO for reproduction and cataloguing, of almost 100 crates of archives that had belonged to YIVO in pre-war Vilna (today, Vilnius, Lithuania), after extensive international coverage of the story. While on a Sabbatical from Drew University during the 2011‚Äì2012 academic year, Nadler was appointed distinguished Visiting Professor at the College of Charleston, in South Carolina, a post which he left after the Fall semester to take a visiting professorship at McGill in January, 2012. While in Montreal, he was called upon to replace, on an interim basis, Rabbi Ronnie Cahana, of Congregation Beth El, one of the city's leading Conservative synagogues, after Cahana suffered a debilitating stroke. What began as a short term engagement, continued until 2014, and Nadler shuttled between his teaching at Drew to officiating as Beth El's rabbi for the next two years. He engendered surprise, given his Orthodox education and rabbinical credentials, and some controversy, when he insisted on moving Beth El to the religious left, as a condition for remaining with the congregation. Among the reforms he instituted were the triennial (rather than the traditional, annual) liturgical cycle of Torah reading, counting women towards the 'minyan' or necessary quorum of ten for public services, and replacing the Orthodox prayer books with those of the Conservative denomination of Judaism. In an irony widely commented upon by observers of Canadian Jewry, this formerly Orthodox rabbi effectively transformed Beth El into the most progressive Conservative synagogue in the country.http://drew.allannadler.academia.edu Rabbi Nadler retired from Drew University in 1997, and was named Wallerstein Professor of Jewish Studies Emeritus. He resides in Paradox, New York State. Criticism of Chabad-Lubavitch movement Nadler has been a public critic of the Chabad- Lubavitch movement, and of the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson. His criticisms of Schneerson in The New York Times, and his subsequent negative assessment of Lubavitch Messianism in a series of articles for The New Republic, were denounced by many Orthodox Canadian and American Rabbis. This was one of many factors that ultimately led Nadler to leave the Orthodox Rabbinate. His evolving theological and historical perspectives, evident in his writings, were however the major reason for his having turned away from Orthodox Judaism, as he articulated in a personal piece in the Baltimore Jewish News. At the same time, Nadler has been an outspoken defendant of, and has published numerous articles championing, some of the world's most distinguished Orthodox rabbis, who were either on the liberal part of the Orthodox religious spectrum, or who had departed Orthodoxy to create new movements of Traditional, or \\"Halakhic\\" Judaism. These included Rabbi Dr. Norman Lamm, President of Yeshiva University, Rabbi David Weiss- Halivni, senior Talmudist at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and Professor of Talmud at Columbia University, and Rabbi Dr. Louis Jacobs, who founded the Masorti (Traditional) Movement in the United Kingdom. Nadler was a disciple of Rabbi Weiss-Halivni in New York, before he immigrated to Israel. Criticism of Hasidism Nadler has been a frequent critic of Haredi rabbis and institutions, including the Dean of one of America's most prominent Yeshivas (Rabbinical schools), Lakewood, New Jersey's Beth Medrash Govoha, Rabbi Aryeh Malkiel Kotler, whom he accused, in The Forward, of approving a racist, anti-Gentile book, \\"Sefer Romemut Yisrael,\\" written by one of the Yeshiva's students. At the same time, Nadler has published scholarly studies of some of the major sects of Hasidism, such as Satmar, Munkatch and Slonim, in addition to a widely noted analysis of the culinary habits of the Hasidim on the Shabbat and Jewish holidays (\\"Holy Kugel\\") that has been widely mistaken for an anti-Hasidic satire. In 2007, however, Nadler published two articles that strongly defended the Orthodox Jewish community: one in response to Noah Feldman's negative expose of Modern Orthodoxy in the New York Times magazine, and the other‚Äîpublished in the Montreal English daily newspaper, The Gazette, in defense of that city's large Hasidic community that had been frequently criticized for uncivil behavior towards their French neighbors. As author Nadler's book, The Faith of the Mithnagdim: Rabbinic Responses to Hasidic Rapture, the definitive scholarly study of the Jewish antagonists of Hasidic Judaism, commonly known as Misnagdim, that emerged from his more narrow Ph.D. thesis, \\"A Religion of Limits: The Religious Thought of Rabbi Pinchas of Polotsk\\" from Harvard University written under the supervision of late Rabbi Dr. Isadore Twersky, is an investigation of the theology of the rabbis who opposed the Hasidic movement in late 18th‚Äìearly 19th century Eastern Europe. Nadler is a regular book critic for The Forward, an American national Jewish newspaper, to which he has contributed more than one hundred articles, essays and book reviews. He was a prolific feature-article writer for Jewish Ideas Daily (now called Mosaic), penning more than fifty articles and reviews, and currently publishes regularly in the Jewish Review of Books. Nadler is widely considered a leading, and provocative public intellectual in contemporary Jewish thought.

Douglas This was to be the hallmark of all her fiction, gently humorous domestic dramas with little if any reference to political events or social change.British Women Novelists, 1910s-1960s Merren Strang, a character in Pink Sugar who writes novels similar to those of O. Douglas, describes her impulse to write \\"something very simple that would make pleasant reading ‚Äî you see, there's nothing of Art for Art's sake about me\\". Merren later quotes one of her reviews: \\"'This is a book about good, gentle, scrupulous people who live on the bright side of life'\\", banteringly describing herself as circumscribed as a novelist by only having met decent people, and thus being unable to create convincing \\"ape and tiger sort of people\\" like the \\"strong novelists\\" of the day.Pink Sugar by O. Douglas, Hodder and Stoughton, 1924, Chapter X. In her obituary, The Scotsman noted: \\"It has been objected that the people of her books are too \\"pleasant,\\" but, at a time when fiction was passing through an ultra-realistic phase, this pleasantness was a relief to many readers.\\"Biography of Helen Masterton (Anna's mother) Bibliography *Olivia in India (1912) *The Setons (1917) *Penny Plain (1920) *Ann and Her Mother (1922) *Pink Sugar (1924) *The Proper Place (1926) *Eliza for Common (1928) *The Day of Small Things (1930) *Priorsford (1932) *Taken by the Hand (1935) *Jane's Parlour (1937) *People Like Ourselves (1938) [Omnibus of Penny Plain, Pink Sugar and Priorsford] *The House That Is Our Own (1940) *Unforgettable, Unforgotten (1945) [under the name Anna Buchan] *Farewell to Priorsford (1950) References Further reading * Wendy Forrester, Anna Buchan and O.

It parodies the Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill. It is set in Finnmark, Norway and portrays the protagonist Jompa Tormann's hunt for Tampa and Papa Buljo. The film depends heavily on satirizing stereotypes about Norway's Sami population. According to the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, Quentin Tarantino watched the film's trailer and was quite happy about it, looking forward to seeing the film itself. A sequel, Kill Buljo 2, was released on December 20, 2013. Plot Jompa Tormann is reluctantly on his way into marriage. The bride's family is gathered at the traditional engagement coffee at Kautokeino community centre when the Deadly Sapmi Assassination Squad, consisting of Tampa Buljo, Crazy Beibifeit, Dr. Kjell Driver and Bud Light assault the premises, draw guns, and fire on anything that moves. Nobody is supposed to leave the centre alive, but Jompa miraculously survives and falls into a deep coma. The Sami- and woman-hating police inspector Sid Wisl√∏ff is assigned to the case together with his assistant Unni Formen. Wisl√∏ff is confident that Jompa Tormann killed all his guests, finishing the act by shooting his own head four times to look innocent. A few weeks later, Jompa awakens, and begins to seek revenge. He has a Katana forged for him by the legendary swords-smith, Fugioshi Shinaga and sets out. He tracks down the members of The Deadly Sapmi Assassination Squad and settles his business with them one by one.

Her surname, Yalan, was an acronym based on her father's name, Yehuda Leib Nissan. Biography Miriam Wilensky (later Yalan-Shteklis) was born in the town of Potoki, near Kremenchuk in the Russian Empire (modern Ukraine). She was the daughter of Hoda (Hadassah) and Yehuda Leib Nissan Vilensky, a Zionist leader descended from a long line of rabbis, and learned Hebrew as a child. After the failed Russian Revolution of 1905, the family moved from place to place: Berlin, Minsk, Petrograd and finally Kharkov. In 1912, when she was 12, her brother Mulya (Shmuel) was sent to Ottoman Palestine to study at the Herzliya Hebrew High School. Yalan-Shteklis attended high school in Minsk and Petrograd, and studied psychology and social sciences at the University of Kharkov. She also pursued Judaic studies at the Hochschule f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin. In 1920, she immigrated to Mandate Palestine and settled in the Rehavia neighborhood in Jerusalem. In 1928, she went to Paris to study library science. From 1929, she joined the staff of the Jewish National University Library at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She headed the Slavic department for 30 years. In 1929, she married Moshe Shtekelis, a professor of archaeology. She died in Haifa on May 9, 1984, at the age of 83. Literary career Yalan-Shteklis published her first poem in Hebrew in 1922. In 1933, she turned to writing poems and stories for children, and published her work in the children's weekly Davar Leyeladim. The pain of losing her mother at the age of 16 permeates many of her poems. She had no children of her own, but displayed an unusual gift for writing for the young and became Israel's leading children's poet. She used to say that \\"poems emanate from the suffering soul and like children, they are born in suffering.\\" She challenged one of the central conventions of modern children's literature ‚Äî the \\"happy ending\\". She portrayed happy children at play, but also their anger and pain, often pointing an accusing finger at adults. An example is her famous poem Levadi (All alone), written in 1957. In addition to poetry, Yalan-Shtelis translated children's literature into Hebrew from Russian, English, German and Dutch, as well as works by Samuel Marshak, Erich Kastner, Leo Tolstoy, P. L. Travers, and others. Literary themes and style Yalan-Shteklis' work is permeated with positive educational values but avoids the trap of didactic preaching. Incorporating nationalist Zionist ideology, but also the traditions of Russian and European literature, her work is nevertheless original and Israeli. The poetry, fiction, and translations of Yalan-Stekelis were collected in three volumes published between 1957 and 1963, with illustrations by Zila Binder: Shir ha-Gedi (Song of the kid); Yesh Li Sod (I have a secret); and Ba-Halomi (In my dream). The works were organized by age level, with a separate volume for each level. In 1986, this collection was reprinted in a single-volume special edition. The first volume contains songs and stories for preschoolers and non-readers. It includes play- songs (an innovation in Hebrew children's poetry), rhymes for finger-play, lullabies, nature poems, poems aimed at the inculcation of good habits, and poems just for amusement and expressing emotions. The second volume, for children with reading skills, offers longer stories that probe the relationships between children and parents, and between children and their peer group. The third volume, for older children, contains Zionist poems about the Land of Israel, bereavement and losing parents in the Holocaust. Alongside poems filled with hope for peace and redemption are lyrical-confessional poems about the fears and emotions of a child trying to come to terms with his/her identity and living in society. Awards *In 1956, Yalan-Shteklis was awarded the Israel Prize for Children's Literature. It was the first time this category was included. In their decision, the judges wrote: \\"‚Ä¶Whatever she wrote, she wrote for children, and whatever she wrote bore no hint of deliberate infantilization but rather of true childhood, genuine and realistic, that embraces joy and innocence but also sorrow and tears, life‚Äôs wisdom and life‚Äôs evils, disappointment and consolation. She flavored her poems for children with all the key ingredients that mark good children‚Äôs poetry. Her work possesses a wonderful sense of the world of children. Language that draws upon sources both ancient and modern, admirable poetic skills and perfect musicality are a rare phenomenon in any nation and language, and not every literature is so blessed\\" (Editorial, Davar li- Yeladim). *In 1968, she was made an Honorary citizen of Jerusalem and granted the Yakir Yerushalaim award. Musical collaboration Many of her poems were set to music and have become Israeli children's classics. In 1975 Israeli singers Shmulik Kraus and Josie Katz put out an album of songs based on her poems.Interview with Shmulik Kraus Published work * Hurry, Hurry Dwarfs!, 1939 [Atzu Ratzu Gamadim] * Danny, 1943 [Danny] * Rain, 1944 [Geshem] * Tol- Tol and His Sand, 1944 [Tol-Tol Ba'al Ha-Hol] * The Journey to the Maybe Island, 1944 [Ha-Masah La Ee Ulai] * The Girl Millik and Aunt Phillik, 1945 [Ma'ase Ba-Yaldah Millik U Ba-Doda Phillik] * Once There Was a Girl, 1946 [Ma'aseh Be-Yaldah] * How Songs Come to the Heart, 1947 [Eich Ba'im Shirim Le- Lev Ha-Adam] * The Story of a Curtain, Paris, 1952 [Ma'aseh Be-Parochet] * Bimmi, 1953 [Bimmi] * Birthday, Dvir, 1962 [Yom Huledet] * Wheels, Hadar 1957 [Galgalim] * Kid's Song, Dvir, 1958‚Äì63 [Shir Ha-Gdi] * I Have a Secret, Dvir, 1958‚Äì63 [Yesh Li Sod] * In My Dream, Dvir, 1958‚Äì63 [Be-Halomi] * Lie?, Ekked, 1966 [Sheker?] * Two Legends, Dvir, 1972 [Shtei Agadot] * Brave Danny and Other Poems, 1975 [Danny Gibor Ve-Shirim Aherim] * A Paper Bridge, 1978 [Gesher Shel Niyar] * Life and Words, Kiryat Sefer, 1978 [Hayim Ve-Milim] * The Soap Cried Loudly, [Hasabon Bakha Me'od] =Translated= * Selected Poems French: Jerusalem, Departament de la Jeunesse du Keren Hayesod, 1946 Russian: Tel Aviv, Am Oved, 1966 * A Paper Bridge Spanish: Jerusalem, Miriam Yalan- Shteklis & Esther Solay-Levy, 1978 * The Journey to the Maybe Island Arabic: Jerusalem, Al-Sharq, 1972 See also *List of Israel Prize recipients *Women in Israel *Israeli literature References Category:1900 births Category:1984 deaths Category:People from Kremenchuk Category:Ukrainian Jews Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the Ottoman Empire Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine Category:Israeli Jews Category:Hebrew-language poets Category:Israeli children's writers Category:Israel Prize in children's literature recipients Category:Israel Prize women recipients Category:Israeli women poets Category:Women children's writers Category:20th-century Israeli women writers Category:20th-century Israeli writers Category:20th-century Israeli poets ","title":"Miriam Yalan-Shteklis"},{"id":"10710014","text":"Adrian John Nichol (born December 1963) is a retired Royal Air Force navigator who was shot down and captured during the Gulf War. Early life Adrian John Nichol was born in North Shields, and attended the St Cuthbert's Grammar School on Gretna Road in Newcastle upon Tyne. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in February 1981 as an electronics technician; having signed up in 1980 and needing sufficient O levels. In the intervening period between school and the RAF, he worked in a large DIY store, although his employers were not aware of his military plans until they sought to promote him to management and he decided to tell them. RAF career Nichol was commissioned as a navigator in December 1986. He served with XV Squadron based at RAF Laarbruch. During Operation Desert Storm in the Gulf War, the squadron was deployed to Muharraq Airfield in Bahrain. Nichol's first mission, on 17 January 1991, entailed flying as number two to Squadron Leader Paul \\"Pablo\\" Mason on an ultra-low- level sortie against Ar Ruma airfield. During the flight, his Panavia Tornado ZD791 was critically damaged by a shoulder-launched SAM SA-14, and Nichol and his pilot, John Peters, were captured by Iraqi forces. After capture Nichol was shown, bruised, on Iraqi television. He was tortured in the Abu Ghraib prison. Nichol was released by the Iraqis at the end of the Gulf War. Nichol remained in the RAF until March 1996.BBC News ‚Äì 1991: Tornado down After repatriation by the Red Cross, Nichol co-authored a book, Tornado Down, with John Peters, about this experience.

The electronic systems on board a spacecraft include attitude determination and control, communications, command and telemetry, and computer systems. Sensors refers to the electronic components on board a spacecraft. For engineers one of the most important considerations that must be made in the design process is the environment in which the spacecraft systems and components must operate and endure. The challenges of designing systems and components for the space environment include more than the fact that space is a vacuum. Altitude determination and control =Overview= One of the most vital roles electronics and sensors play in a mission and performance of a spacecraft is to determine and control its altitude, or how it is orientated in space. The orientation of a spacecraft varies depending on the mission. The spacecraft may need to be stationary and always pointed at Earth, which is the case for a weather or communication satellite. However, there may also be the need to fix the spacecraft about an axis and then have it spin. The attitude determination and control system, ACS, ensures the spacecraft is behaving correctly. Below are several ways in which ACS can obtain the necessary measurements to determine this. =Magnetometer= This device measures the strength of the Earth's magnetic field in one direction. For measurements on all three axes, the device would consist of three orthogonal magnetometers. Given the spacecraft's position, the magnetic field measurements can be compared to a known magnetic field which is given by the International Geomagnetic Reference Field model. Measurements made by magnetometers are affected by noise consisting of alignment error, scale factor errors, and spacecraft electrical activity. For near-Earth orbits, the error in the modelled field direction may vary from 0.5 degrees near the Equator to 3 degrees near the magnetic poles, where erratic auroral currents play a large role.Pisacane, Vincent L. Fundamentals of Space Systems. New York, Oxford University Press, 2005 The limitation of such a device is that in orbits far from Earth, the magnetic field is too weak and is actually dominated by the interplanetary field which is complicated and unpredictable. =Sun sensors= This device works on the light entering a thin slit on top of a rectangular chamber that casts an image of a thin line on the bottom of the chamber, which is lined with a network of light-sensitive cells. These cells measure the distance of the image from a centerline and using the height of the chamber can determine the angle of refraction. The cells operate based on the photoelectric effect. Incoming photons excite electrons and therefore causing a voltage across the cell, which is, in turn, converted into a digital signal. By placing two sensors perpendicular to each other the complete direction of the sun with respect to the sensor axes can be measured. Digital solar aspect detectors Also known as DSADs, these devices are purely digital Sun sensors. They determine the angles of the Sun by determining which of the light-sensitive cells in the sensor is the most strongly illuminated. By knowing the intensity of light striking neighbouring pixels, the direction of the centroid of the sun can be calculated to within a few arcseconds. =Earth horizon sensor= Static Static Earth horizon sensors contain a number of sensors and sense infrared radiation from the Earth‚Äôs surface with a field of view slightly larger than the Earth. The accuracy of determining the geocenter is 0.1 degrees in near-Earth orbit to 0.01 degrees at GEO. Their use is generally restricted to spacecraft with a circular orbit. Scanning Scanning Earth horizon sensors use a spinning mirror or prism and focus a narrow beam of light onto a sensing element usually called a bolometer. The spinning causes the device to sweep out the area of a cone and electronics inside the sensor detect when the infrared signal from Earth is first received and then lost. The time between is used to determine Earth‚Äôs width. From this, the roll angle can be determined. A factor that plays into the accuracy of such sensors is the fact the Earth is not perfectly circular. Another is that the sensor does not detect land or ocean, but infrared in the atmosphere which can reach certain intensities due to the season and latitude. =GPS= This sensor is simple in that using one signal many characteristics can be determined. A signal carries satellite identification, position, the duration of the propagated signal and clock information.Abid, Mohamed M. Spacecraft Sensors. West Sussex, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., 2005, p301 Using a constellation of 36 GPS satellites, of which only four are needed, navigation, positioning, precise time, orbit, and attitude can be determined. One advantage of GPS is all orbits from Low Earth orbit to Geosynchronous orbit can use GPS for ACS. Command and telemetry =Overview= Another system which is vital to a spacecraft is the command and telemetry system, so much in fact, that it is the first system to be redundant. The communication from the ground to the spacecraft is the responsibility of the command system. The telemetry system handles communications from the spacecraft to the ground. Signals from ground stations are sent to command the spacecraft what to do, while telemetry reports back on the status of those commands including spacecraft vitals and mission specific data. =Command systems= The purpose of a command system is to give the spacecraft a set of instructions to perform. Commands for a spacecraft are executed based on priority. Some commands require immediate execution; other may specify particular delay times that must elapse prior to their execution, an absolute time at which the command must be executed, or an event or combination of events that must occur before the command is executed. Spacecraft perform a range of functions based on the command they receive. These include: power to be applied to or removed from a spacecraft subsystem or experiment, alter operating modes of the subsystem, and control various functions of the spacecraft guidance and ACS. Commands also control booms, antennas, solar cell arrays, and protective covers. A command system may also be used to upload entire programs into the RAM of programmable, micro- processor based, onboard subsystems. The radio-frequency signal that is transmitted from the ground is received by the command receiver and is amplified and demodulated. Amplification is necessary because the signal is very weak after traveling the long distance. Next in the command system is the command decoder. This device examines the subcarrier signal and detects the command message that it is carrying. The output for the decoder is normally non-return-to-zero data. The command decoder also provides clock information to the command logic and this tells the command logic when a bit is valid on the serial data line. The command bit stream that is sent to the command processor has a unique feature for spacecraft. Among the different types of bits sent, the first are spacecraft address bits. These carry a specific identification code for a particular spacecraft and prevent the intended command from being performed by another spacecraft. This is necessary because there are many satellites using the same frequency and modulation type. The microprocessor receives inputs from the command decoder, operates on these inputs in accordance with a program that is stored in ROM or RAM, and then outputs the results to the interface circuitry. Because there is such a wide variety of command types and messages, most command systems are implemented using programmable micro-processors. The type of interface circuitry needed is based on the command sent by the processor. These commands include relay, pulse, level, and data commands. Relay commands activate the coils of electromagnetic relays in the central power switching unit. Pulse commands are short pulses of voltage or current that is sent by the command logic to the appropriate subsystem. A level command is exactly like a logic pulse command except that a logic level is delivered instead of a logic pulse. Data commands transfer data words to the destination subsystem. =Telemetry systems= Commands to a spacecraft would be useless if ground control did not know what the spacecraft was doing. Telemetry includes information such as: * Status data concerning spacecraft resources, health, attitude and mode of operation * Scientific data gathered by onboard sensors (telescopes, spectrometers, magnetometers, accelerometers, electrometers, thermometers, etc.) * Specific spacecraft orbit and timing data that may be used for guidance and navigation by ground, sea, or air vehicles * Images captured by onboard cameras (visible or infrared) * Locations of other objects, either on the Earth or in space, that are being tracked by the spacecraft * Telemetry data that has been relayed from the ground or from another spacecraft in a satellite constellation The telemetry system is responsible for acquisition from the sensors, conditioners, selectors, and converters, for processing, including compression, format, and storage, and finally for transmission, which includes encoding, modulating, transmitting and the antenna. There are several unique features of telemetry system design for spacecraft. One of these is the approach to the fact that for any given satellite in LEO, because it is traveling so quickly, it may only be in contact with a particular station for ten to twenty minutes. This would require hundreds of ground stations to stay in constant communication, which is not at all practical. One solution to this is onboard data storage. Data storage can accumulate data slowly throughout the orbit and dump it quickly when over a ground station. In deep space missions, the recorder is often used the opposite way, to capture high-rate data and play it back slowly over data-rate-limited links. Another solution is data relay satellites. NASA has satellites in GEO called TDRS, Tracking and Data Relay Satellites, which relay commands and telemetry from LEO satellites. Prior to TDRS, astronauts could communicate with the Earth for only about 15% of the orbit, using 14 NASA ground stations around the world. With TDRS, coverage of low-altitude satellites is global, from a single ground station at White Sands, New Mexico. Another unique feature of telemetry systems is autonomy. Spacecraft require the ability to monitor their internal functions and act on information without ground control interaction. The need for autonomy originates from problems such as insufficient ground coverage, communication geometry, being too near the Earth-Sun line (where solar noise interferes with radio frequencies), or simply for security purposes. Autonomy is important so that the telemetry system already has the capability to monitor the spacecraft functions and the command systems have the ability to give the necessary commands to reconfigure based on the needs of the action to be taken. There are three steps to this process: 1\\\\. The telemetry system must be able to recognize when one of the functions it's monitoring deviates beyond the normal ranges. 2\\\\. The command system must know how to interpret abnormal functions, so that it can generate a proper command response. 3\\\\. The command and telemetry systems must be capable of communicating with each other. Sensors Sensors can be classified into two categories: health sensors and payload sensors. Health sensors monitor the spacecraft or payload functionality and can include temperature sensors, strain gauges, gyros and accelerometers. Payload sensors may include radar imaging systems and IR cameras. While payload sensors represent some of the reason the mission exists, it is the health sensors that measure and control systems to ensure optimum operation.

A design rationale is an explicit documentation of the reasons behind decisions made when designing a system or artifact. As initially developed by W.R. Kunz and Horst Rittel, design rationale seeks to provide argumentation-based structure to the political, collaborative process of addressing wicked problems.

The first system providing IBIS support was Hans Dehlinger's STIEC.Dehlinger, H. (1978), Project STIEC: Systems Analysis of the Generation and Dissemination of Scientific and Technological Information in the European Community\\" Report No. 26: Report on a Batch - Version of STIEC, Heidelberg/Stuttgart Rittel developed a small system in 1983 (also not published) and the better known gIBIS (graphical IBIS) was developed in 1987.Conklin, J.; YakemBegemanovic, M. (1988). \\"gIBIS: A hypertext tool for exploratory policy discussion\\". ACM Transactions on Office Information Systems 6 (4): 303-331. Not all successful DR approaches involve structured argumentation. For example, Carroll and Rosson's Scenario-Claims Analysis approachCarroll, JM; Rosson, M (1992). \\"Getting around the task-artifact cycle: how to make claims and design by scenario\\". ACM Trans. Inf. Syst. 10 (2): 181-212 captures rationale in scenarios that describe how the system is used and how well the system features support the user goals. Carroll and Rosson's approach to design rationale is intended to help designers of computer software and hardware identify underlying design tradeoffs and make inferences about the impact of potential design interventions.Carroll, J. M., & Rosson, M. B. (2003). Design rationale as theory. HCI models, theories, and frameworks: toward a multidisciplinary science, 431-461.  Key concepts in design rationale  There are a number of ways to characterize DR approaches. Some key distinguishing features are how it is captured, how it is represented, and how it can be used. = Rationale capture = Rationale capture is the process of acquiring rationale information to a rationale management ; Capture methods * A method called \\"Reconstruction\\" captures rationales in a raw form such as video, and then reconstruct them into a more structured form.Burge, J.; Brown, D.C. (1998), Design Rationale: Types and Tools, Technical Report, Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept., retrieved on 27 April 2007 The advantage of Reconstruction method is that rationales can be carefully captured and capturing process won't disrupt the designer. But this method might result in high cost and biases of the person producing the rationales * The \\"Record-and-replay\\" method simply captures rationales as they unfold. Rationales are synchronously captured in a video conference or asynchronously captured via bulletin board or email-based discussion. If the system has informal and semi-formal representation, the method will be helpful. * The \\"Methodological byproduct\\" method captures rationales during the process of design following a schema. But it's hard to design such a schema. The advantage of this method is its low cost. * With a rich knowledge base (KB) created in advance, the \\"Apprentice\\" method captures rationales by asking questions when confusing or disagreeing with the designer's action. This method benefits not only the user but the system. * In \\"Automatic Generation\\" method, design rationales are automatically generated from an execution history at low cost. It has the ability in maintaining consistent and up-to-date rationales. But the cost of compiling the execution history is high due to the complexity and difficulty of some machine-learning problems. * The \\"Historian\\"Chen, A.; McGinnis, B.; Ullman, D.; Dietterich, T. (1990), \\"Design History Knowledge Representation and Its Basic Computer Implementation\\", The 2nd International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology, Chicago, IL, pp. 175-185 method let a person or computer program watches all designer's actions but does not make suggestions. Rationales are captured during the design process. = Rationale representation = The choice of design rationale representation is very important to make sure that the rationales we capture is what we desire and we can use efficiently. According to the degree of formality, the approaches that are used to represent design rationale can be divided into three main categories: informal, semiformal, or formal. In the informal representation, rationales can be recorded and captured by just using our traditionally accepted methods and media, such as word processors, audio and video records or even hand writings. However, these descriptions make it hard for automatic interpretation or other computer-based supports. In the formal representation, the rationale must be collected under a strict format so that the rationale can be interpreted and understood by computers. However, due to the strict format of rationale defined by formal representations, the contents can hardly be understood by human being and the process of capturing design rationale will require more efforts to finish, and therefore becomes more intrusive. Semiformal representations try to combine the advantages of informal and formal representations. On one hand, the information captured should be able to be processed by computers so that more computer based support can be provided. On the other hand, the procedure and method used to capture information of design rationale should not be very intrusive. In the system with a semiformal representation, the information expected is suggested and the users can capture rationale by following the instructions to either fill out the attributes according to some templates or just type into natural language descriptions. = Argumentation-based models = ; The Toulmin model : One commonly accepted way for semiformal design rationale representation is structuring design rationale as argumentation. The earliest argumentation- based model used by many design rationale systems is the Toulmin model. The Toulmin model defines the rules of design rationale argumentation with six steps:Reynolds, Chris (2000), What is the Toulmin Model? Paper at concentric.net. :# Claim is made; :# Supporting data are provided; :# Warrant provides evidence to the existing relations; :# Warrant can be supported by a backing; :# Model qualifiers (some, many, most, etc.) are provided; :# Possible rebuttals are also considered. :One advantage of Toulmin model is that it uses words and concepts which can be easily understood by most people. ; Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) : Another important approach to argumentation of design rationale is Rittel and Kunz's IBIS (Issue-Based Information System), which is actually not a software system but an argumentative notation. It has been implemented in software form by gIBIS (graphical IBIS), itIBIS (test-based IBIS), Compendium, and other software.Conklin, J.; Yakemovic, K. (1991). \\"A Process-Oriented Approach to Design Rationale\\". Human-Computer Interaction 6 (3 & 4): 357‚Äì391. IBIS uses some rationale elements (denoted as nodes) such as issues, positions, arguments, resolutions and several relationships such as more general than, logical successor to, temporal successor to, replaces and similar to, to link the issue discussions. ; Procedural Hierarchy of Issues (PHI) : PHI (Procedural Hierarchy of Issues)McCall, R.J. (1991). \\"PHI: A Conceptual Foundation for Design Hypermedia\\". Design Studies 12 (1): 30‚Äì41. extended IBIS to noncontroversial issues and redefined the relationships. PHI adds the subissue relationship which means one issue's resolution depends on the resolution of another issue. ; Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC) : QOC (Questions, Options, and Criteria)Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Bellotti, VME.; Moran, T. (1996), \\"Questions, Options, and Criteria: Elements of Design Space Analysis\\", in Moran, T.; Carroll, J., Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, pp. 53-106 is used for design space analysis. Similar to IBIS, QOC identifies the key design problems as questions and possible answers to questions as options. In addition, QOC uses criteria to explicitly describe the methods to evaluate the options, such as the requirements to be satisfied or the properties desired. The options are linked with criteria positively or negatively and these links are defined as assessments. ; Decision Representation Language (DRL) : DRL (Decision Representation Language)Lee, J. (1991), \\"Extending the Potts and Bruns model for recording design rationale\\", Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '13), IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, pp. 114-125 extends the Potts and Bruns model of DR and defines the primary elements as decision problems, alternatives, goals, claims and groups. Lee (1991) has argued that DRL is more expressive than other languages. DRL focuses more on the representation of decision making and its rationale instead of on design rationale. ; RATSpeak : Based on DRL, RATSpeak is developed and used as the representation language in SEURAT (Software Engineering Using RATionale).Burge, J. (2005), Software Engineering Using design RATionale, Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept RATSpeak takes into account requirements (functional and non-functional) as part of the arguments for alternatives to the decision problems. SEURAT also includes an Argument Ontology which is a hierarchy of argument types and includes the types of claims used in the system. ; WinWin Spiral Model : The WinWin Spiral Model, which is used in the WinWin approach,Barry Boehm; Kitapci, H. (2006), \\"The WinWin Approach: Using a Requirement Negotiation Tool for Rationale Capture and Use\\", in Dutoit, A.H.; McCall, R.; Mistr√≠k, I. et al., Rationale Management in Software Engineering, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 173-190 adds the WinWin negotiation activities, including identifying key stakeholders of the systems, and identifying the win conditions of each stakeholder and negotiation, into the front of each cycle of the spiral software development modelBarry Boehm (1998). \\"A spiral model of software development and enhancement\\". Computer 21 (5): 61‚Äì72 in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory (winwin) agreement for all stakeholders of the project. : In the WinWin Spiral Model, the goals of each stakeholder are defined as Win conditions. Once there is a conflict between win conditions, it is captured as an Issue. Then the stakeholders invent Options and explore trade-offs to resolve the issue. When the issue is solved, an Agreement which satisfies the win conditions of stakeholders and captures the agreed option is achieved. Design rationale behind the decisions is captured during the process of the WinWin model and will be used by stakeholders and the designers to improve their later decision making. The WinWin Spiral model reduces the overheads of the capture of design rationale by providing stakeholders a well-defined process to negotiate. InBose, P. (1995). \\"A Model for Decision Maintenance in the WinWin Collaboration Framework\\". Knowledge Based Software Engineering (KBSE '95). an ontology of decision rationale is defined and their model utilizes the ontology to address the problem of supporting decision maintenance in the WinWin collaboration framework. ; Design Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM) : DRIM (Design Recommendation and Intent Model) is used in SHARED-DRIM. The main structure of DRIM is a proposal which consists of the intents of each designer, the recommendations that satisfy the intents and the justifications of the recommendations. Negotiations are also needed when conflicts exist between the intents of different designers. The recommendation accepted becomes a design decision, and the rationale of the unaccepted but proposed recommendations are also recorded during this process, which can be useful during the iterative design and/or system maintenance.  Applications  Design rationale has the potential to be used in many different ways. One set of uses, defined by Burge and Brown (1998), are: * Design verification ‚Äî The design rationale can be used to verify if the design decisions and the product itself are the reflection of what the designers and the users actually wanted. * Design evaluation ‚Äî The design rationale is used to evaluate the various design alternatives discussed during the design process. * Design maintenance ‚Äî The design rationale helps to determine the changes that are necessary to modify the design. * Design reuse ‚Äî The design rationale is used to determine how the existing design could be reused for a new requirement with or without any changes in it. If there is a need to modify the design, then the DR also suggests what needs to be modified in the design. * Design teaching ‚Äî The design rationale could be used as a resource to teach people who are unfamiliar with the design and the system. * Design communication ‚Äî The design rationale facilitates better communication among people who are involved in the design process and thus helps to come up with a better design. * Design assistance ‚Äî The design rationale could be used to verify the design decisions made during the design process. * Design documentation ‚Äî The design rationale is used to document the entire design process which involves the meeting room deliberations, alternatives discussed, reasons behind the design decisions and the product overview. DR is used by research communities in software engineering, mechanical design, artificial intelligence, civil engineering, and human-computer interaction research. In software engineering, it could be used to support the designers ideas during requirement analysis, capturing and documenting design meetings and predicting possible issues due to new design approach.Dutoit, A.; McCall, B.; Mistrik et al., eds. (2006), Rationale Management in Software Engineering, Springer pp.1-48. In software architecture and outsourcing solution design, it can justify the outcome of architectural decisions and serve as a design guide.O. Zimmermann, C. Miksovic, J. K√ºster, Reference Architecture, Metamodel and Modeling Principles for Architectural Knowledge Management in Information Technology Services. Journal of Systems and Software, Elsevier. Vol. 85, Issue 9, Sept. 2012 In civil engineering, it helps to coordinate the variety of work that the designers do at the same time in different areas of a construction project. It also help the designers to understand and respect each other's ideas and resolve any possible issues.Whelton, Michael; Ballard, Glenn; Tommelein, Iris (2007) Application Of Design Rationale Systems To Project Definition ‚Äì Establishing A Research Project. Retrieved on 27 April 2007 The DR can also be used by the project managers to maintain their project plan and the project status up to date. Also, the project team members who missed a design meeting can refer back the DR to learn what was discussed on a particular topic. The unresolved issues captured in DR could be used to organize further meetings on those topics. Design rationale helps the designers to avoid the same mistakes made in the previous design. This can also be helpful to avoid duplication of work. In some cases DR could save time and money when a software system is upgraded from its previous versions. There are several books and articles that provide excellent surveys of rationale approaches applied to HCI,Moran, T.; Carroll, J., eds.

As the bishops had jurisdiction over the missions to Scandinavia, it also gives a report of the Norse paganism of the period. The existence of the work was forgotten in the later medieval period, until it was re-discovered in the late 16th century in the library of Sor√∏ Abbey, Denmark. Contents The treatise consist of the following parts: *an introduction, addressed to bishop Liemar *Book 1: History of the bishopric of Bremen and (after 845) Hamburg-Bremen (788‚Äì940) *Book 2: History of the archbishopric Hamburg-Bremen (940‚Äì1045) *Book 3: Biography of archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg (r. 1043‚Äì1072) *Book 4: Descriptio insularum aquilonis: Geographical description of Northern Europe *M. Adami epilogus ad Liemarum episcopum: A dedication to bishop Liemar in hexameters The text is one of the most important sources of Northern German and Scandinavian history and geography in the Viking Age and the beginning High Middle Ages. It covers the relations between Saxons, Wends (West Slavs) and Danes (Vikings). The third book is focused on the biography of archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg. Adam based his works in part on Einhard, Cassiodorus, and other earlier historians, consulting the library of the church of Bremen. The text as presented to bishop Liemar was completed in 1075/1076. After the death of Bishop Leuderich (838‚Äì45), the see was given to Ansgar, it lost its independence, and from that time on was permanently united with the Archdiocese of Hamburg. The Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen was designated the \\"Mission of the North\\" and had jurisdiction over all missions in Scandinavia, and the entire scope of Viking expansion in the north (Russia, Iceland, Greenland), throughout the Viking Age, until the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen had a falling-out with the pope, and separate archbishopric for the North was established in Lund in 1105. Adam is also an important source of Viking Age Norse paganism, including the practice of human sacrifice: \\"There is a festival at Uppsala every nine years [...] The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred to the people that the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings.\\" The description of the temple at Uppsala is one of the most famous excerpts of the Gesta: :\\"In this temple, entirely decked out in gold, the people worship the statues of three gods in such wise that the mightiest of them, Thor, occupies a throne in the middle of the chamber; Wotan and Frikko have places on either side. (‚Ä¶) Thor, they say, presides over the air, which governs the thunder and lightning, the winds and rains, fair weather [and] crops. The other, Wotan ‚Äì that is, Fury [Wodan, id est furor] ‚Äì carries on war and imparts to man strength against his enemies. The third is Frikko, who bestows peace and pleasure on mortals. His likeness, too, they fashion with an immense phallus.\\" The fourth book describes the geography of Scandinavia and the Baltic region. It mentions numerous episcopal seats and churches, including Meldorf, Schenefeld, Verden (), Pahlen, Ratzeburg, Mecklenburg, Oldenburg in Holstein and Jumne. Beyond this, it gives a description of the coast of Scandinavia and of the \\"northern isles\\" including Iceland, Greenland and notably (in chapter 39) Vinland (North America),Adam mentions Vinland (Winland) in Chapter 39 of Book IV of his Gesta: From pp. 275‚Äì276: \\"XXXVIIII. Praeterea unam adhuc insulam recitavit a multis in eo repertam oceano, quae dicitur Winland, eo quid ibi vites sponte nascantur, vinum optimum ferentes. Nam et fruges ibi non seminatas habundare, non fabulosa opinione, sed certa comperimus relatione Danorum. Post quam insulam, ait, terra non invenitur habitabilis in illo oceano, sed omnia, quae ultra sunt, glacie intolerabili ac caligine immensa plena sunt. Cujus rei Martianus ita meminit: Ultra Thilen, inquiens, navigatione unius diei mare concretum est. Temptavit hoc nuper experientissimus Nordmannorum princeps Haraldus. Qui latitudinem septentrionalis oceani perscrutatus navibus tandem caligantibus ante ora deficientis mundi finibus, inmane baratrum abyssi retroactis vestigiis vix salvus evasit.\\" (39. In addition, he [i.e., Sweyn Estridsson, king of Denmark (reigned 1047‚Äì1076)] named one more island in this ocean, discovered by many, which is called \\"Vinland\\", because vines grow wild there, making the best wine. For [that] crops [that are] not sown, abound there, we learn not from fanciful opinion but from the true account of the Danes. Beyond which island, it is said, habitable land is not found in that ocean, but all [places] that are beyond, are filled with intolerable ice and boundless fog. About this subject Martianus [i.e., Martianus Capella (fl. ca. 410‚Äì420) in his De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii (On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury), Book VI, ¬ß 666] recalled: At one day's sailing beyond Thule, he says, the sea is frozen. Harald [i.e., Harald Hardrada (ca. 1015‚Äì1066), King of Norway], the most enterprising leader of the Normans, recently attempted [to go] to this place. [It was he] who ‚Äì the extent of the northern ocean having been investigated by [his] ships ‚Äì finally by withdrawing from the fogs before the edge at the world's end, barely escaped safely the vast abyss of Hell by reversing [his] tracks.) being the oldest extant written record of the Norse discovery of North America. Adam of Bremen had been at the court of Danish king Sven Estridson and was informed about the Viking discoveries in the North Atlantic there. Author Adam is believed to have come from Meissen (Latin Misnia) in Saxony. He was probably born before 1050 and died on 12 October of an unknown year (possibly 1081, at the latest 1085). From his chronicles it is apparent that he was familiar with a number of authors. The honorary name of Magister Adam shows that he had passed through all the stages of a higher education. It is probable that he was taught at the Magdeburger Domschule. In 1066 or 1067 he was invited by archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg to join the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen.Remy, Arthur F.J. \\"Adam of Bremen.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Sept. 2012 Adam was accepted among the capitulars of Bremen, and by 1069 he appeared as director of the cathedral's school. Soon thereafter he began to write the history of Hamburg-Bremen and of the northern lands in his Gesta. His position and the missionary activity of the church of Hamburg-Bremen allowed him to gather information on the history and the geography of Northern Germany. A stay at the court of Svend Estridson gave him the opportunity to find information about the history and geography of Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries. Manuscript tradition According to Schmeidler (1917), Adam created three versions of the text, in the convention of Schmeidler (1917) labelled *(A) representing his preliminary text, *(a) the work as given to bishop Liemar, and *(X) which he kept for his own use and supplemented with various additions (scholia). None of the three archetypes has been preserved. The most relevant surviving manuscripts are classified into three groups, labelled A, B and C. The best manuscript is of group A, labelled A1 (National Library Vienna, cod. 521), dated to the first half of the 13th century. Parts of book 2, book 4 and some scholia are also preserved in a ms. dated ca. 1100 (Leiden University Library, Codex Vossianus Latinus, VLQ 123). Manuscripts in the B and C groups are derived from version X. They contain independent additions of scholia. The best ms. in group B was the so- called Codex z, written 1161/2, which was however lost in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. Some copies of this ms. are extant. The best ms. in group C, labelled C1, is at the Copenhagen Royal Library, Old Royal Collection, No. 2296 quarto (dated c. 1230). Editions The editio princeps was printed in 1595 after the now-lost ms. C2 by Erpold Lindenberg. It was reprinted as ' in 1609 and 1630. The fourth book was edited by Johannes Messinus in Stockholm in 1615, and by Stephanus Johannes Stephanius in Leiden in 1629. A revised edition by Joachim Johannes Mader appeared in Helmstedt in 1670, reprinted 1706 by J. A. Fabricius in Hamburg. The first critical edition, based on ms. A1, is due to Johann Martin Lappenberg, published 1846. It was included in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica series, appearing in a revised edition by Georg Waitz in 1876, and edited by Migne in 1884 (PL 146).

It was home of Andrew Wylie, first president of Indiana University, until his death in 1851. In 1859, following the death of Andrew's widow Margaret, Theophilus Adam Wylie, professor at Indiana University and half- cousin to Andrew, purchased the house from their heirs and his family resided there until his widow's death in 1913. Today Wylie House is operated as an historic house museum by Indiana University Libraries to interpret the lives of these families.\\"Wylie House Museum\\", accessed 15 Feb. 2014. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs.  1835 - 1859: Andrew Wylie family period  In transitioning from the \\"State Seminary\\" to Indiana College in 1828 the state legislature sought to hire a college president. They offered the position to Andrew Wylie, then president of Washington College (now Washington & Jefferson College) in western Pennsylvania, who accepted. In 1829 Wylie arrived in Bloomington, Indiana with his wife, Margaret Ritchie, and their children. Wylie became the first president and third faculty member of the newly renamed Indiana College. (In 1838 the name changed again to Indiana University. It was also sometimes referred to as Indiana State University in the mid-nineteenth century.) For the first several years the family resided in rental properties. In 1835 Andrew Wylie built a house on a tract of land near the college that he had purchased in 1829 and 1830. Andrew, Margaret and ten of their twelve children lived in the house, in various numbers from 1835 to 1859. The house itself is a two-story brick structure, with a Flemish bond facade. Atypical for buildings of the 1830s, the house is a blend of Georgian and Federal styles. This style may have seemed old fashioned compared to the contemporary Greek Revival style that was becoming fashionable at the time of construction. One explanation of this architectural choice relates to the area from which the Wylies arrived. Southwestern Pennsylvania was culturally influenced by northern Virginia, an area that continued to be dominated by Georgian architecture. Further, Wylie designed his house based on Manchester house, a home in Washington County, Pennsylvania, which in turn recreates the builder's original house in Newport, Rhode Island. The widow's walk present in Wylie's house is evidence of this connection. The house was the center of a farmstead, and as such was surrounded by numerous outbuildings. According to a memory map made by a Wylie descendant in 1954, these included a smoke house, double-pen barn, an elaborate log chicken house, a carriage house and a two- story utility building. The outbuildings reflect the various activities undertaken in and around this house - butchering, smoking and salting meats, gathering wood for winter months, preserving foods, laundering clothes and so on. It is notable that hired servants were difficult to find and often unreliable in frontier towns such as Bloomington in the 1830s and 1840s. As a result, most of this work was undertaken by the Wylie household themselves.  1859 - 1913: Theophilus Adam Wylie family period  In 1837 President Wylie invited Theophilus Adam Wylie, his half-cousin, to teach mathematics, natural philosophy, and chemistry at Indiana College. In 1838 Theophilus married Rebecca Dennis of Germantown, PA and brought his bride to Bloomington. They lived in a series of rental houses until 1859, when following the death of Andrew's widow, Theophilus purchased the house and 5 of the from their heirs. Theophilus Wylie's household was often quite large, with six of his eight children growing up in the house (two died in early childhood prior to 1859), and several extended family members living with or taking extended visits to the home over the rest of the century. During this period, the character of Bloomington had begun to change from a frontier settlement to a burgeoning college town. In addition to family, the Wylies took in two boarders at a time, either students or young professors from the college. Likewise servants, absent from the house during the Andrew Wylie period, formed a part of the household during the Theophilus Adam Wylie period. Among them was Lizzie Breckinridge, an African American woman and daughter of a former slave, who came to work and live with the family in 1856 at the age of thirteen. Breckinridge stayed in this position until at her death in 1910. The house was the site of several scientific and technological advancements. Theophilus began to experiment with photography soon after the daguerreotype process was invented in 1839, many of the photographs he took at the house survive today. He often used a telescope for celestial observations from the roof of the house. And in 1876 Theophilus installed the first telephone in state of Indiana, built from plans sent to him from a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, that ran between the house and a college laboratory. Theophilus was an active faculty member at Indiana University until 1886. In that year he became an emeritus professor in which capacity he served until his death in 1895. Rebecca Wylie continued to live in the house until her death in 1913.  Wylie House Museum  Dr. Amos Hershey, a professor of political science at Indiana University, bought the house from the Wylie heirs in 1915. While he and his wife Lillian lived there, they undertook the first significant changes to the building. In addition to modernizing the kitchen and bathrooms and adding a furnace, they enclosed the second story porch, removed the ground floor pantries and screened in the front porch on the first floor. They also added pediment awnings over the front door and a small slanting roof over the east door to the kitchen. In 1947 Herman B Wells, then president of Indiana University, helped the university acquire the house from Dr. Hershey's widow, who continued to live there until 1951. Between 1951 and 1959 the house was home to Indiana University Press. Then in the period between 1960 and 1965, major restorations of the house were conducted aimed at bringing it back to its original configuration. In attempting to remove all features added to the house since its construction, the restoration removed at least one feature now believed to be original to the house, a small back porch. Today, known as Wylie House Museum, the building is a historic house museum that presents the house as it would have looked prior to 1860. With an inventory from 1859 as a guide it is furnished with a combination of Wylie family heirlooms and period pieces.

Early life Hugh de Stafford was born around 1342, the second and youngest son of Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford and Margaret de Audley. His elder brother, Ralph, was intended to inherit the title and had been married to Maud Grosmont, daughter of Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and Isabel de Beaumont in 1344, with the expectation that he would expand the Stafford estates by inheriting the Lancastrian duchy. However, Ralph died early in 1347 and Hugh became heir.Ralph Stafford, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Around 1358, Hugh became the 3rd Lord Audley. Hugh joined his father in the French campaigns in 1359, being part of the retinue of Edward, Prince of Wales, spending time in Gascony and northern Spain. Political career He spent many years in military service, before returning to England and being summoned to Parliament in 1371 as Lord Stafford and later as Earl Stafford. On 31 August 1372, he inherited the title of 2nd Earl of Stafford. He was a member of a number of royal commissions, such as ones on Scottish affairs and on coastal defence. He was on the committee of nobles who conferred regularly with the Commons, being deemed suitable by that House to be part of the new 'continual council' of state. He did not always make the best decisions though and was admonished by his peers for censuring John Philipot, the London MP and merchant who had mobilised a fleet to defend merchant shipping. Marriage and children On or before 1 March 1350, Hugh de Stafford married Philippa de Beauchamp daughter of Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick and Katherine Mortimer.

Ralph was killed by King Richard II's half-brother, John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter in a feud during an expedition against the Scots in July 1385, over a retainer's death by one of Ralph's archers. #Thomas de Stafford, 3rd Earl of Stafford (c. 1368 ‚Äì 4 July 1392). Inherited at age of 18. Married Anne of Gloucester, daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester and Eleanor de Bohun. No issue, the marriage was reportedly never consummated. #William Stafford, 4th Earl of Stafford (21 September 1375 ‚Äì 6 April 1395). Inherited from his brother at the age of 14. He was a ward of the Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester. He died at 19, no issue. #Katherine de Stafford (c. 1376 ‚Äì 8 April 1419). Married Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk. #Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford (2 March 1377 ‚Äì 22 July 1403). Inherited the earldom from his brother at the age of 17.

Later life and death Hugh's wife Phillippa died on 6 April 1386, and it was probably this combined with the death of his son that pushed him to undertake a series of pilgrimages. He went first to Walsingham and then sailed for Jerusalem. He only got to Rhodes, where he died in the hospital the knights of St John in October of that year. His bones were returned to Stone Priory, Staffs, for burial next to his wife. Ancestry  References  External links *Stafford' s Inquisition post mortem, 1386.

Two of the subs were lost to stranding and one went missing, now presumed sunk by a mine. In 1918, the German occupation of Tallinn and the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty forced the flotilla to move to Helsinki, under the protection of the Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic. The German intervention in the Finnish Civil War and the landing of the 10,000-strong German Baltic Sea Division in Hanko forced the crew to scuttle the eight remaining submarines and the three support ships, Cicero, Emilie and Obsidian, outside Helsinki harbour. A similar fate awaited the flotilla's Russian counterpart. The Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet had left four Russian Holland type submarines without support in Hanko. The arrival of German troops under R√ºdiger von der Goltz on 3 April, forced the Russians to hastily scuttle the submarines‚Äîincluding and ‚Äîin Hanko harbour.

Aftermath The crews of the scuttled submarines were evacuated by Soviet ships to Petrograd and by rail to Murmansk, to join with the Allied intervention forces in North Russia, only weeks before hostilities cut railway lines to Murmansk. Among the officers were future Admirals and commanders of the British Submarine Service, Sir Noel Laurence and Sir Max Horton and Vice Admiral Leslie Ashmore. Admiral Aksel Berg also served as Liaison Officer from the Imperial Russian Navy, before going on to become the Deputy Minister of Defence for the Soviet Union (1953‚Äì57). In 1935, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) concluded between Britain and Germany, allowed Germany to increase the size of its navy to one-third the size of the Royal Navy, which would have had the effect of allowing the Kriegsmarine to dominate the Baltic. Some Finns raised some parts of the scuttled British submarines before World War II but recognized that they were beyond feasible repair and returned them back into the sea. It is believed that the remains were raised in 1953 by the German company Beckedorf Gebryder and used as scrap metal.

The first prototype, an all-metal biplane powered by a BMW 132 radial engine, flew in 1936, while a second prototype was powered by a Junkers Jumo 210 liquid-cooled engine. The two prototypes were evaluated against the similar Focke-Wulf Fw 62. The BMW-powered version was considered worthy of further study, and a batch of six was sent for further evaluation with the Legion Condor during the Spanish Civil War. The Arado Ar 95 was the basis for the prototype Ar 195 carrier-based torpedo bomber, which was proposed for operation from the German aircraft carrier . Operational history Arado Ar 95 The Ar 95 was not ordered by the German armed forces, and so was offered for export in two versions, the Ar 95W floatplane and Ar 95L landplane, with a fixed, spatted undercarriage. Six Ar 95Ls were ordered by the Chilean Air Force, being delivered prior to the start of World War II. Turkey placed an order for Ar 95Ws, but these were taken over by Germany at the outbreak of war. The requisitioned Ar 95s were designated by the Luftwaffe as the Ar 95A, and were used for training and for coastal reconnaissance operations in the Baltic Sea, operating off the coast of Latvia and Estonia in 1941, and in the Gulf of Finland.

His family had continued ties to France through the Irish Brigade. MacCarthy followed a maternal uncle into serving with royal French forces, Charles with units under √©migr√© direction. He also served in the Dutch and British armies. MacCarthy was appointed in 1812 by the British as military governor of former French territories Senegal and Gor√©e, after Napoleon was defeated in Russia and retreated with high losses. When the Napoleonic Wars ended, the United Kingdom returned these colonies to France in the Treaty of Paris in 1814, and MacCarthy was appointed governor of Sierra Leone. He was killed by Ashanti forces in the battle of Nsamankow, with his skull used as a trophy of war. Early and personal life Charles Gu√©rault was born in 1764 in Cork in Ireland, the son of French √©migr√© Jean Gabriel Gu√©rault, formerly Procureur de Roi (Crown prosecutor), and his Irish wife Yvette Parra (MacCarthy) (also recorded as Charlotte Michelle McCarthy). As a young man, Charles changed his name at an early age to MacCarthy, his mother's maiden name, on the advice of his uncle Thaddeus MacCarthy , then a colonel in the Life Guards of Louis XV. (In one history book, his name is recorded as \\"Charles McCarthy-Lyragh.\\") It was better for Charles not to be identified with his √©migr√© father during the French Revolution and its aftermath. The uncle later served as a captain in the 9th Regiment of Foot. In 1812, MacCarthy at the age of 48 married Antoinette Carpot, a French woman, the year he was appointed as governor of two former French territories in Africa. They had one son, Charles. After the senior MacCarthy's death, his namesake son Charles was adopted by his uncle , the Comte de Merv√©. The younger Charles MacCarthy succeeded to that title as a naturalised French citizen on his uncle's death. Military career At the age of 21, in 1785, MacCarthy joined the Irish Brigade of the French army, as a sub-lieutenant in the R√©giment de Berwick; by 1791 he had attained the rank of Captain, and was serving with the √©migr√© royalist army under Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond√© in Germany. He later served with the army of the Dutch Republic as a volunteer, in Damas' Regiment, from 1793 to 1794. He was wounded in the leg during an action outside Louvain on 15 July 1794. MacCarthy subsequently saw service in the Duc de Castries's Regiment of the √©migr√© army, and when the Irish Brigade was reorganised in British pay in late 1794, he was appointed an ensign in the Regiment of Le Comte de Conway (the 6th Regiment of the Brigade). He served in the West Indies with the Regiment of Le Comte de Walsh-Serrant (the 2nd Regiment) from 1796 to 1798. Returning from Honduras on the transport in June 1798 with the grenadier company of that regiment, MacCarthy was wounded whilst in a day-long action fighting off a French privateer. The Irish Brigade was disbanded as a whole in late 1798. He received his first British commission on 17 October 1799, when he was appointed to command a company of the 11th West India Regiment, and transferred to a captaincy in the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot on 15 March 1800. He was appointed a Major in the New Brunswick Fencible Infantry (later the 104th Foot) on 14 April 1804 and remained with them until 1811, when at the age of about 57, he received a Lieutenant-Colonelcy in the Royal African Corps. West African governor In 1812 MacCarthy was appointed the Governor of Senegal and Gor√©e, which the British had acquired following Napoleon's defeat in Russia. When these territories were returned to France by the Treaty of Paris, MacCarthy was appointed in 1814 as the Governor of Sierra Leone. This was the colony established by the British in West Africa in the late eighteenth century for the resettlement of Black Loyalists from North America and London after the Revolutionary War. They also deported maroons from Jamaica to here, and resettled slaves liberated from illegal slave ships after Britain and the United States prohibited the Atlantic slave trade. As governor, MacCarthy took a strong interest in the welfare of the colony, actively encouraging the building of housing and schools for the settlers. He was a correspondent of William Wilberforce, and founded many settlements for liberated slaves. In addition, he arranged for the support and education of native children whose parents had been captured by slavers, in schools run by the Church Missionary Society. As a result of this involvement, he campaigned for the complete suppression of the slave trade. Whilst the slave trade was abolished in the United Kingdom and its territories, and the United States had banned the Atlantic slave trade for its citizens from 1808, Portugal and Spain still supported the slave trade in West African waters, and in their Central and South American colonies, using ships nominally flagged in countries which had not yet abolished it. In 1818 MacCarthy signed a treaty with Mang√© Demba, according to which the √éles de Los (off the coast of Guinea) were ceded to the British in exchange for an annual rent. MacCarthy was knighted on 21 November 1820, and on 19 July 1821 was promoted to the rank of Colonel with the temporary rank of Brigadier-General in West Africa. After the African Company of Merchants was abolished in 1821, for its failure to suppress the slave trade efficiently, Great Britain took on the Gold Coast as a crown colony. It was placed under the government of Sierra Leone, and MacCarthy became the governor of both. MacCarthy Island in the Gambia was named in his honour whilst governor. Death during the Battle of Nsamankow In late 1823, following the disagreements between the Fanti and the Ashanti, MacCarthy declared war on the king of the Ashanti. After organising the defences of Cape Coast, he set out with an expedition of some 80 men of the Royal African Colonial Corps, 170 men of the Cape Coast Militia, and 240 Fanti tribesmen under their local chiefs. He was accompanied by a captain and an ensign of the 2nd West India Regiment, as aides-de-camp, a surgeon of the same regiment, and J. T. Williams, his colonial secretary. In addition, he drew on three other groups of infantry that were in the region: one of 600 regulars of the RACC and 3,000 native levies, one of 100 regulars and militia and 2,000 levies (under Major Alexander Gordon Laing), and a third of 300 regulars and militia and 6,000 levies. The plan was for the four groups to converge and engage the enemy with overwhelming force. On the night of the 20th, still without having joined forces with the other three groups, his force camped by a tributary of the Pra River. The next day, at around 2pm, they encountered a large enemy force of around 10,000 men; in the belief that the Ashanti army contained several disaffected groups whose chiefs were willing to defect, MacCarthy instructed the band to play the British National Anthem loudly. The Ashanti responded by approaching closer, beating war drums, and his beliefs were swiftly dispelled. Fighting started shortly thereafter; the two sides were separated by a stream, which the Ashanti made no major attempt to ford, both sides held their lines and kept up a continual musket fire. However, the British forces were lightly supplied; the bearers bringing the supplies up in the rear, which included most of the gunpowder and ammunition, mostly fled after hearing the firing in the distance and encountering deserters straggling back. Only one additional barrel of powder and one of shot were brought up, and ammunition ran out around 4pm; the Ashanti made a determined attempt to cross the river, and quickly broke into the camp. Almost all the British force were killed immediately; only around 20 managed to escape. MacCarthy, along with the ensign and his secretary, attempted to fall back; he was wounded by gunfire, however, and killed by a second shot shortly thereafter. Ensign Wetherell was killed whilst trying to defend MacCarthy's body and Williams taken prisoner. On his return, he related that he had survived only by being recognised by an Ashanti chief for whom he had done a small favour, and was spared. Williams was held prisoner for several months, locked in a hut which he shared with the severed heads of MacCarthy and Wetherell, kept as trophies of war. McCarthy's gold-rimmed skull was later used as a drinking-cup by the Ashanti rulers. MacCarthy was succeeded as governor by military officer Charles Turner.

Offprints from scientific, technical, and medical (STM) journals are used by researchers in some fields to generate awareness among audiences who don't subscribe to the journal e.g. physicians, consumers, investors etc. They are usually ordered directly from the publisher of the journal. However, some third-party service providers also exist, serving as an intermediary that provides a single source of offprints from multiple publishers. Book publishing In book publishing, if a reprint has been revised from an earlier version, it is usually referred to as a new edition rather than a reprint. Collectible card games In collectible card games, a reprint is a card published in an earlier card set which is published again in a new card set. Often, the art on the card may be changed, or the text updated to reflect new errata. Comic books Publishers will reprint classic comic books from years or even decades ago, often restoring the art with newer techniques. The reprints may be standalone comic books, compilation trade paperbacks, or back-ups in other comic books. Comic books which sell out may be given a second (or more) printing in order to bring more copies to the distributor.
