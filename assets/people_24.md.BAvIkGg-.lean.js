It was the last of the Eighth Doctor Adventures range and features the Eighth Doctor, Fitz Kreiner, and Trix MacMillan. Plot The Eighth Doctor, accompanied by Fitz Kreiner and Trix MacMillan, overthrows the tyrant Mondova on an alien world, prevents a time-travelling alien from interfering in Ancient Roman history, and stops a Dalek (never named as such, but heavily implied) invasion of Mars. Against this backdrop, Fitz and Trix have begun a relationship and decide to leave the TARDIS. The Doctor returns to Earth in 2005, materialising at the grave of Sam Jones. When the Doctor claims not to remember his former companion, Fitz becomes angry and leaves with Trix. As the pair attempt to readjust to normal life, it is revealed that Trix has been secretly passing information gained on their travels to another former companion, Anji Kapoor, who has used the information to manipulate the stock market and thus built up a considerable fortune. The Doctor discovers that another Time Lord, Marnal, had also survived the destruction of Gallifrey, and has been living for the past hundred years as a human science-fiction writer (whose books are actually the history of the Time Lords and their homeworld). Marnal, who also claims to be the original owner of the Doctor's TARDIS, blames the Doctor for the cataclysm, and takes him and the TARDIS captive while the insectoid alien Vore invade the Earth. The Vore attack leaves millions dead or missing, including Fitz, who apparently dies trying to save Trix. After a cold fusion explosion guts the interior of the TARDIS, the Doctor discovers that K-9 Mark II has been aboard ever since Gallifrey's destruction, hidden behind a false wall, with orders from Lady President Romana of Gallifrey to kill him. However, K-9 pauses once it scans the Doctor's mind and discovers the reason why the Doctor has lost his memory. It transpires that, just prior to destroying Gallifrey, the Doctor (with the help of his former companion Compassion) had downloaded the entire contents of the Gallifreyan Matrix — the massive computer network containing the mental traces of every Time Lord living and dead, more than 140,000 Time Lords – into his brain, with his own memories suppressed to make room for the data. Gallifrey had not actually been erased from history, but an event horizon in relative time prevented anyone from Gallifrey's past from travelling beyond Gallifrey's destruction, and vice versa. Both the planet and the Time Lords could be restored, along with the Doctor's memory, if a sufficiently sophisticated computer could be found to reconstruct them. Before that could be done, however, the problem of the Vore must be dealt with. Marnal is wounded while fighting the Vore, and being on his last regeneration, he dies. The Doctor tells him that he is his hero, and Marnal dies in peace, confident that the Time Lords will be reborn. The Doctor reveals that the Vore have not actually killed their victims, but sprayed them with a chemical that makes them invisible to humans; Fitz is still alive and the Doctor brings him back for Trix, claiming he brought the dead back to life on his first day on the job. The Doctor, Fitz, Trix and his allies travel to Africa with a Royal Navy Battle Group to confront the threat of the Vore. The novel and the Eighth Doctor Adventures end uncertainly, as the Doctor leaps into the very heart of the Vore hive. Continuity *This is the last novel of its series (which began with The Eight Doctors). Fear Itself (by Nick Wallace), a novel published subsequently featuring the Eighth Doctor but set before The Gallifrey Chronicles, came out as part of the Past Doctor Adventures line. *The use of the seal of Rassilon on the cover mirrors its use on the cover of the first Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, The Eight Doctors. *References are made in this novel to the Timewyrm (from the Virgin New Adventures), former companion Samantha Jones, and various events that have occurred during the course of the Eighth Doctor Adventures. *Marnal was mentioned in The Infinity Doctors and The Taking of Planet 5. *One of Marnal's written works is titled \\"The Giants\\", the opening passage of \\"The Giants\\" in The Gallifrey Chronicles is identical to the prologue of Death Comes to Time. The plot of another book resembles that of The Infinity Doctors, also written by Parkin. Other unused Doctor Who story titles referenced in the book include The Witch Lords (a working title for State of Decay) and The Red Fort (a proposed First Doctor historical story commissioned from Terry Nation). *Possible threats to Gallifrey mentioned by Marnal include the Klade (Father Time), the Tractites (Genocide), Tannis (Death Comes to Time), Centro (The Infinity Doctors) and the Ongoing. *Marnal gives a list of some of the Eighth Doctor's companions, including some not mentioned before: Delilah, Frank, Deborah, Jemima-Katy, Nina, and Beatrice (possibly Trix). *Larna speaks of a prophecy that, before its fall, Gallifrey will be attacked by several enemies. These include Omega (The Three Doctors), the Sontarans (The Invasion of Time), Tannis (Death Comes to Time), Varnax (from an unproduced film project), Catavolcus (the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip story The Neutron Knights, DWM #60), and the Timewyrm (Timewyrm: Revelation). *The TARDIS interior from the 1996 telemovie is destroyed by a cold fusion device, leaving the way clear for the redesigned interior seen from \\"Rose\\" onwards. *When Marnal is looking through the various timestreams for the Eighth Doctor, he observes that the Doctor has \\"three ninth incarnations\\" (page 62: 'As for his future. . . he has three ninth incarnations. I’ve never seen anything like it.’).The three ninth incarnations references the character played by Rowan Atkinson in the 1999 parody Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, the \\"Shalka Doctor\\" voiced by Richard E. Grant in the animated story Scream of the Shalka, and the official Ninth Doctor played by Christopher Eccleston. *At one point in the novel, Marnal mentions that he was visited by his son in the 1970s. *At the novel's end, the Doctor, Trix MacMillan and Fitz Kreiner are set to confront the Vore invasion force. The ultimate fates of Fitz and Trix, and whether they leave the TARDIS or not, have yet to be revealed.

Its territory, called Pheniatis (ἡ Φενεατική or ἡ ΦενεᾶτιςAlciphr. 3.48 or η Φενική),So in Polybius was bounded on the north by that of the Achaean towns of Aegeira and Pellene, east by the Stymphalia, west by the Cleitoria, and south by the Caphyatis and Orchomenia. This territory is shut in on every side by lofty mountains, offshoots of Mount Cyllene and the Aroanian chain; and it is about 7 miles (12 km) in length and the same in breadth. Two streams descend from the northern mountains, and unite their waters about the middle of the valley; the united river bore in ancient times the name of Olbius and Aroanius. There is no opening through the mountains on the south; but the waters of the united river are carried off by subterranean channels (katavóthra) in the limestone rocks, and, after flowing underground, reappear as the sources of the river Ladon. In order to convey the waters of this river in a single channel to the katavóthra, the inhabitants at an early period constructed a canal, 50 stadia in length, and 30 feet (9 m) in breadth.Catull. 68.109. This great work, which was attributed to Heracles, had become useless in the time of Pausanias, and the river had resumed its ancient and irregular course; but traces of the canal of Heracles are still visible, and one bank of it was a conspicuous object in the valley when it was visited by William Martin Leake in 1806. The canal of Heracles, however, could not protect the valley from the danger to which it was exposed, in consequence of the katavóthra becoming obstructed, and the river finding no outlet for its waters. The Pheneatae related that their city was once destroyed by such an inundation, and in proof of it they pointed out upon the mountains the marks of the height to which the water was said to have ascended. Pausanias evidently refers to the yellow border which is still visible upon the mountains and around the plain: but in consequence of the great height of this line upon the rocks, it is difficult to believe it to be the mark of the ancient depth of water in the plain, and it is more probably caused by evaporation; the lower parts of the rock being constantly moistened, while the upper are in a state of comparative dryness, thus producing a difference of colour in process of time. It is, however, certain that the Pheneatic plain has been exposed more than once to such inundations. Pliny the Elder says that the calamity had occurred five times; and Eratosthenes related a memorable instance of such an inundation through the obstruction of the katavóthra, when, after they were again opened, the water rushing into the Ladon and the Alpheius overflowed the banks of those rivers at Olympia. The account of Eratosthenes has been confirmed by a similar occurrence in modern times. In 1821 the katavóthra became obstructed, and the water continued to rise in the plain till it had destroyed of cultivated country. Such was its condition till 1832, when the subterraneous channels again opened, the Ladon and Alpheius overflowed, and the plain of Olympia was inundated. Other ancient writers allude to the katavóthra and subterraneous course of the river of Pheneus.Theophr. Hist. Plant. 3.1; The katavóthra and so-called canal of Heracles at Pheneus Pheneus is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad, and was more celebrated in mythical than in historical times. Virgil represents it as the residence of Evander; and its celebrity in mythical times is indicated by its connection with Heracles. Pausanias found the city in a state of complete decay. The acropolis contained a ruined temple of Athena Tritonia, with a brazen statue of Poseidon Hippius. On the descent from the acropolis was the stadium; and on a neighbouring hill, the sepulchre of Iphicles, the brother of Heracles. There was also a temple of Hermes, who was the principal deity of the city., et seq. The lower slope of the mountain, upon which the remains of Pheneus stand, is occupied by a village now called Archaia Feneos. There is, however, some difficulty in the description of Pausanias compared with the existing site. Pausanias says that the acropolis was precipitous on every side, and that only a small part of it was artificially fortified; but the summit of the insulated hill, upon which the remains of Pheneus are found, is too small apparently for the acropolis of such an important city, and moreover it has a regular slope, though a very rugged surface. Hence Leake supposes that the whole of this hill formed the acropolis of Pheneus, and that the lower town was in a part of the subjacent plain; but the entire hill is not of that precipitous kind which the description of Pausanias would lead one to suppose, and it is not impossible that the acropolis may have been on some other height in the neighbourhood, and that the hill on which the ancient remains are found may have been part of the lower city. There were several roads from Pheneus to the surrounding towns. Of these the northern road to Achaea ran through the Pheneatic plain. Upon this road, at the distance of 15 stadia from the city, was a temple of Apollo Pythius, which was in ruins in the time of Pausanias. A little above the temple the road divided, the one to the left leading across Mount Crathis to Aegeira, and the other to the right running to Pellene: the boundaries of Aegeira and Pheneus were marked by a temple of Artemis Pyronia, and those of Pellene and Pheneus by that which is called Porinas (ὁ καλούμενος Πωρ́ινας), supposed by Leake to be a river, but by Ernst Curtius a rock.-9. Pausanias describes the two roads which led westward from Pheneus around a mountain - that to the right or northwest leading to Nonacris and the supposed river Styx, and that to the left to Cleitor. Nonacris was in the territory of Pheneus. The road to Cleitor ran at first along the canal of Heracles, and then crossed the mountain, which formed the natural boundary between the Pheneatis and Cleitoria, close to the village of Lycuria. On the other side of the mountain the road passed by the sources of the river Ladon., 8.20.1. This mountain, from which the Ladon springs, was called Penteleta (Πεντελεία).Hesych. and Phot. s.v. The fortress, named Penteleium (Πεντέλειον), which Plutarch says was near Pheneus, must have been situated upon this mountain.Plutarch, Arat. 39, Cleom. 17. The southern road from Pheneus led to Orchomenus, and was the way by which Pausanias came to the former city. The road passed from the Orchomenian plain to that of Pheneus through a narrow ravine (φάραγξ); in the middle of which was a fountain of water, and at the further extremity the village of Caryae. The mountains on either side were named Oryxis (Ὄρυξις), and Sciathis (Σκίαθις), and at the foot of either was a subterraneous channel, which carried off the water from the plain., 8.14.1. The eastern road from Pheneus led to Stymphalus, across Mount Geronteium, which formed the boundary between the territories of the two cities. To the left of Mt. Geronteium near the road was a mountain called Tricrena (Τρίκρηνα), or the three fountains; and near the latter was another mountain called Sepia (Σηπία), where Aepytus is said to have perished from the bite of a snake.-2. Its site is located near the modern Archaia Feneos, formerly Kalyvia, in the municipal unit of Feneos.

Winzer\\", p. 463, Gallaudet University Press, 1993, Harper's Songs are ancient Egyptian texts that originated in tomb inscriptions of the Middle Kingdom (but found on papyrus texts until the Papyrus Harris 500 of the New Kingdom), which in the main praise life after death and were often used in funerary contexts. These songs display varying degrees of hope in an afterlife that range from the skeptical through to the more traditional expressions of confidence.Lichtheim, 1976, p. 115 These texts are accompanied by drawings of blind harpists and are therefore thought to have been sung.\\"Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs\\", James P. Allen, p343, Cambridge University Press, 2000, Thematically they have been compared with The Immortality of Writers in their expression of rational skepticism.Lichtheim, 1976, p. 175-178  Background  The distinction between songs, hymns and poetry in ancient Egyptian texts is not always clear. The convention is to treat as songs those poetic texts which are depicted with musical instruments. If the songs are seen to have a clear connection with temple cults and festivals then they are commonly described as hymns.Lichtheim, 1975, p. 193 Poetic texts which are shown with scenes of labor are compared with songs sung by Egyptian laborers in the modern era and are also therefore classified as songs. Other songs relate to the cult of the dead and are nearly always depicted with harps from which the title \\"Harper's Songs\\" is derived. Since the songs are reflections on death, rather than being part of the rituals associated with burial, freer expression of thoughts is encountered in these texts. Songs sought to reassure the owner of the tomb about his fate after death by way of praise. The greater freedom, in the case Harper's Song from the Tomb of King Intef, even went so far as to doubt the reality of an afterlife, lamenting death and advising that life should be enjoyed whilst it could. Miriam Lichtheim viewed this as introducing a more skeptical strand of thought which would be reflected in works such as the Dispute between a Man and His Ba and other Harper's Songs.  Middle Kingdom  The short song from the funerary stela of Iki is depicted with the deceased sitting at an offering table with his wife and the rotund harpist Neferhotep sitting in front of them: > O tomb, you were built for festivity, > You were founded for happiness! > The singer Neferhotep, born of Henu.Lichtheim, 1975, p. 194 The stela of Nebankh from Abydos contains a Harper's Song with the deceased shown seated at the offering table with the harpist squatting in front of him: > The singer Tjeniaa says: > How firm you are in your seat of eternity, > Your monument of everlastingness! > It is filled with offerings of food, > It contains every good thing. > Your ka is with you, > It does not leave you, > O Royal Seal-Bearer, Great Steward, Nebankha! > Yours is the sweet breath of the northwind! > So says his singer who keeps his name alive, > The honorable singer Tjeniaa, whom he loved, > Who sings to his ka every day. > A song from the tomb of Paatenemheb, which dates from the reign of Akhenaten, is described in its introductory line as having been copied from the tomb of a King Intef, (a name used by several kings from 11th and 17th dynasties) It is also preserved in the Ramesside New Kingdom Harris 500 papyrus. These works are accepted by scholars as being a copy of a genuine Middle Kingdom text.Lichtheim, 1975, pp. 194-195 The song suggests a person should enjoy the good things in life, avoid contemplation of death and expresses doubt about the reality of an afterlife. > Make holiday, don't weary of it!! > Look, there is no one allowed to take their things with them, > and there is no one who goes away comes back again. > Comparison have been made between the sentiments expressed in the above text with a description by Herodotus from a much later period of how a banquet for the rich in Egypt would culminate with a wooden effigy of the deceased being passed around with the saying \\"Look upon this!\\" and \\"drink and rejoice, for thou shalt be as this.\\"\\"Egyptian Literature\\", Ed. Epiphanius Wilson, Trans. Ludwig Stern, p. 347, Colonial Press, 1901 Harpers Songs from the New Kingdom period respond to the rational skepticism displayed in this song by way of outright rejection of impiety or by moderating the skepticism.Lichtheim, 1975, p. 195  New Kingdom  In the case of the priest Neferhotep the three Harper's songs found in his tomb display a full range of viewpoints. In one the sceptical position is blended with the more conventional expressions of hope, the second rejects skepticism, whilst the third is a ritualistic affirmation in life after death. > I have heard those songs that are in the ancient tombs, > And what they tell > Extolling life on earth and belittling the region of the dead. > Wherefore do they thus, concerning the land of eternity, > The just and the fair, > Which has no terrors? > > Wrangling is its abhorrence; no man there girds himself against his fellow. > It is a land against which none can rebel. > All our kinsfolk rest within it, since the earliest day of time; > The offspring of millions are come hither, every one. > For none may tarry in the land of Egypt, > None there is who has not passed yonder. > > The span of earthly things is as a dream; > But a fair welcome is given him who has reached the West.\\"Temples, Tombs > and Hieroglyphs\\", Barbara Mertz, translation by Alan H.

It is a remake of the 1920 film The Amazing Quest of Mr. Ernest Bliss, based on The Curious Quest, a novel by E. Phillips Oppenheim. The film was issued in the United States in 1937 under the title The Amazing Adventure (and subsequently Romance and Riches), but edited down to 62 minutes from the reputed original UK running time of 80 minutes. All currently circulating copies are of the US edit, but the British Film Institute has several archive prints of 77 minutes in length. The film is often believed to be in the public domain and appears on many budget VHS and DVD releases, but as director Alfred Zeisler did not die until 1985, UK copyright subsists until the end of 2055. As a non-US film still under copyright in its country of origin on 1 January 1996, it is protected in the US for 95 years after publication, so to the end of 2031. Plot In London, rich, idle socialite Ernest Bliss (Cary Grant) feels out of sorts for no discernible reason. He sees a doctor, Sir James Aldroyd, who bluntly informs him that he is suffering from too much money, that if he would be cured if he lived for a year on a few pounds per week. Bliss is so insulted that he makes a bet for £50,000 with Sir James that he can survive for a year, supporting himself solely on whatever he earns and not touching his inherited millions. He takes the Underground to Stepney Green and rents an attic room. He falls behind on the rent, but landlady Mrs. Heath is sympathetic to his plight. Finally, despite having no experience, he persuades Mr. Masters to give him a job selling Alpha stoves. After three weeks, he has not made a single sale, and Frances Clayton (Mary Brian), Masters' secretary, tells Bliss that the company, in which Masters has invested his life savings, is in danger of closing down. Then Bliss comes up with an idea to promote the product. He takes £500 of his own money - but not for his own benefit, so the bet is still on - and offers free meals cooked on the stoves to the general public. A wholesale buyer places a trial order for 100 stoves, with the prospect of purchasing 40,000 a year if things work out. Masters is delighted and offers Bliss a partnership, but Bliss instead resigns. After he finds another job, Bliss takes Frances to dinner. As they dance, she informs him that she too is leaving Masters; he offered her a partnership too, but of the matrimonial kind. Late one night, Dr. Alroyd engages a car and a chauffeur for a medical emergency. That chauffeur turns out to be Bliss. After Bliss drives the doctor back to Harley Street, Bliss informs him that almost seven months have elapsed on their bet. Dorrington, another customer, asks him to come to 11 Regents Park Gate, flat 6, which happens to be Bliss's place. Bliss's valet Clowes, with too much time on his hands, lost heavily betting on the dogs and let the flat to Dorrington. Dorrington has noticed the \\"resemblance\\" between the chauffeur and the absent owner. Dorrington has practiced forging Bliss's signature and wants the chauffeur to cash a cheque for £30,000 in return for a third share. Bliss gets the cashier to give him blank pieces of paper in an envelope and returns to his flat. He reveals who he is to Dorrington and his henchman, but they do not believe him. In the ensuing fight, Dorrington slips away with the worthless envelope while Bliss struggles with the henchman. Finally a drunk Clowes emerges and hits the henchman with a bottle. Afterward, Bliss forgives his servant. Frances gets a job with Mr. Montague; he makes it clear that he wants more than a secretary, but she needs the work. When she tells Bliss that Montague wants her to do some work outside the office at night, Bliss disables Montague's car and has her hire him to take them to Montague's rendezvous. After confirming that Montague's intentions are not honourable, he takes Frances away. When his boss sacks him, he is unconcerned, but then the manager discharges mechanic Bill Bronson for standing up for him, so Bliss buys the company and orders that the manager be fired and replaced by Bill. He persuades Frances to accept his marriage proposal. Then her mother arrives with terrible news; Frances's sister will die unless she is taken to a winter resort in Switzerland. In desperation, Frances decides to marry Masters for the money she needs. She moves without informing Bliss. He finally tracks her down and, after learning why she broke up with him, fixes everything and marries her himself.

Coincidences are highly improbable, and the whole thing, despite excellent direction and acting, moves at a pace that demands a large measure of cutting before being offered to the general public... Cary Grant looks and acts the part with deft characterization. He secures laughs easily and apparently without effort. Mary Brian plays the role of the typist with a metallic harshness which would be more in keeping with the gold-digger. One expects more feminine softness and sympathy from such a role. Most of the other actors and actresses are adequate, and production details are very good\\". In his book British Popular Films 1929-1939: The Cinema of Reassurance, Stephen Shafer notes that the plot was intended to appeal to working-class filmgoers, as it gave over the message that their lives were more fulfilling than those of millionaires.

He was the second son of Władysław, Duke of Opole-Racibórz, by his wife Euphemia, daughter of Władysław Odonic, Duke of Greater Poland. Life Little is known about the first years of Casimir's life. By 1264, he was knighted by King Ottokar II of Bohemia and with this began his politic activities with his father. After the death of his father in 1282, Casimir inherited the Duchy of Opole with his brother Bolko I as co-rulers. The common rule between them lasted until 1284, when they decided to make a formal division of their domains: Casimir took the towns of Bytom (the main city and now capital of his Duchy), Koźle, Toszek, Gliwice and Siewierz. There are few reports of Casimir's independent rule. Certainly at the end of the 1280s he and his brothers Mieszko I and Przemysław supported the Bishop of Wrocław, Thomas II Zaremba in his conflict with Henry IV Probus, the powerful Duke of Wrocław -their other brother Bolko I unexpectedly supported Henry IV. The cause of the bad relations between Władysław Opolski's sons and the Duke of Wrocław possibly started when Henry IV repudiated his wife Constance (sister of the Opole-Racibórz brothers) and sent her back home. The reasons for this repudiation are disputed among historians, but it probably was because of the Constance's suspected infertility. The difficult relations with Henry IV Probus brought a much greater enemy into the Silesian affairs. On 10 January 1289 Casimir was the first Silesian Duke to pay homage to the Bohemian King Wenceslaus II in Prague. The direct arguments which caused Casimir to make this radical step are unclear. In any event, the Dukes of Cieszyn and Racibórz soon followed the example of Casimir and also paid homage to the Kingdom of Bohemia (some historians believed that this could be the cause of the bloody Battle of Siewierz on 26 February of that year). In subsequent years, Casimir remained a faithful ally of King Wenceslaus II in his Polish politics, although the close cooperation with the Bohemian Kingdom didn't directly benefit him (except for his presence during the King's trips to Sieradz in 1292 or at the coronation of Wenceslaus II in Prague in 1297). In 1303, Casimir decided to give his sons separate districts, which further helped to reduce the already small Duchy of Bytom: Bolesław received Toszek and Władysław obtained Koźle. The extinction of the Přemyslid dynasty after the death of King Wenceslaus III in 1306 caused the Duke of Bytom to stop his homage to the Bohemian crown. From that moment, Casimir had a significant change in his foreign politics, became more closely associated with the new Duke of Kraków, Władysław I the Elbow-high. The marriage of Casimir's daughter Maria to the Hungarian King Charles Robert in 1306 surely increased the prestige of both Casimir and his Duchy. In internal politics, Casimir was a strong guardian of the Catholic Church, especially the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Miechów of the Canons of the Holy Sepulchre, which received many privileges from him. He also gave the order to build castles of considerable size in Bytom and surrounding towns, thanks to the revenues obtained from the silver mines in Bytom. Casimir died on 10 March 1312. It's unknown where he was buried but it is possible that the burial could have occurred in the monastery of Czarnowąsy in Opole, which was generously supported by the Duke. Marriage and issue Between 1275–1278, Casimir married Helena (d. by 1323), whose origins are unknown. Given by her name and the choice of her children's names, historians believed that she had a Russian or Lithuanian origin;J. Horwat, Piastowie górnośląscy, Bytom 2007, pp. 37–41 according to genealogist Kazimierz Jasiński, she may have been a daughter of Lev I of Galicia by his wife Constance, daughter of King Béla IV of Hungary,K. Jasiński, Rodowód Piastów śląskich, vol. III, ed. II, Kraków 2007, pp. 517-518. although other theories placed her as daughter of Lev I's brother Shvarn, Grand Duke of Lithuania.J. Horwat, Helena, [in:] A. Barciak (ed.), Książęta i księżne Górnego Śląska, Katowice 1995, pp. 47–48. If Helena was indeed Lev I's daughter, she was probably named after Constance's sister Blessed Jolenta Helena of Poland, wife of Bolesław the Pious, one of the Greater Poland Dukes. They had six children: # Bolesław (b. 1276/78 – d. 17 January 1329). # Władysław (b. 1277/83 – d. by 8 September 1352). # Siemowit (b. 1292 – d. aft. 1 July 1342). # Maria (b. ca. 1295 – d. Temesvár, 15 December 1317), married in 1306 to King Charles I Robert of Hungary. # George (b. 1300 – d. by 1327). # Mieszko (b. ca. 1305 – d. bef. 9 August 1344). The considerable age difference between Casimir's three older and three younger children created the theory that he maybe had more than one wife. However, there is no evidence that supports this and the majority of historians accept that Helena was his only wife and mother of all his known children.

Upper tier: dedication to the Dis Manibus and Christian motto in Greek letters (, \\"fish of the living\\", a predecessor of the Ichthys symbol); middle tier: depiction of fish and an anchor; lower tier: Latin inscription of the identity of the deceased . Christianity in the ante-Nicene period was the time in Christian history up to the First Council of Nicaea. This article covers the period following the Apostolic Age of the first century, c.100 AD, to Nicaea in 325 AD. The second and third centuries saw a sharp divorce of Christianity from its early roots. There was an explicit rejection of then-modern Judaism and Jewish culture by the end of the second century, with a growing body of adversus Judaeos literature. Fourth- and fifth-century Christianity experienced pressure from the government of the Roman Empire and developed strong episcopal and unifying structure. The ante-Nicene period was without such authority and was more diverse. Many variations in this era defy neat categorizations, as various forms of Christianity interacted in a complex fashion.Siker (2000). pp. 232–234. One variation was proto-orthodoxy which became the international Great Church and in this period was defended by the Apostolic Fathers. This was the tradition of Pauline Christianity, which placed importance on the death of Jesus as saving humanity, and described Jesus as God come to Earth. Another major school of thought was Gnostic Christianity, which placed importance on the wisdom of Jesus saving humanity, and described Jesus as a human who became divine through knowledge.The Diversity of Early Christianity While the Jewish Christian church was centered in Jerusalem in the first century, Gentile Christianity became decentralized in the second century.Langan, The Catholic Tradition (1998), pp.55, 115 Various local and provincial ancient church councils were held during this period, with the decisions meeting varying degrees of acceptance by different Christian groups. Major figures of the second century who were later declared by the developing proto-orthodoxy to be heretics were Marcion, Valentinius, and Montanus. Although the use of the term Christian is attested in the Acts of the Apostles (80–90 AD), the earliest recorded use of the term Christianity (Greek: ) is by Ignatius of Antioch about 107 AD,Walter Bauer, Greek-English LexiconIgnatius of Antioch Letter to the Magnesians 10, Letter to the Romans (Roberts- Donaldson tr., Lightfoot tr., Greek text) who is also associated with modification of the sabbath, promotion of the bishop, and critique of the Judaizers.  Beliefs Eschatology= The predominant eschatological view in the Ante-Nicene period was Premillennialism, the belief of a visible reign of Christ in glory on earth with the risen saints for a thousand years, before the general resurrection and judgment. Justin Martyr and Irenaeus were the most outspoken proponents of premillennialism. Justin Martyr saw himself as continuing in the “Jewish” belief of a temporary messianic kingdom prior to the eternal state.Johannes Quasten, Patrology, Vol. 1 (Westminster, Maryland: Christian Classics, Inc.), 219. (Quasten was a Professor of Ancient Church History and Christian Archaeology at the Catholic University of America) Furthermore according to the Encyclopedia of the Early Church “Justin (Dial. 80) affirms the millenarian idea as that of Christians of complete orthodoxy but he does not hide that fact that many rejected it.” M. Simonetti, “Millenarism,” 560.Justin never achieved consistency in his eschatology. He seemed to believe in some sense that the Kingdom of God is currently present. This belief is an aspect of postmillennialism, amillennialism and progressive dispensationalism. In Justin's First Apology he laments the Romans' misunderstanding of the Christians' endtime expectations. The Romans had assumed that when Christians looked for a kingdom, they were looking for a human one. Justin corrects this misunderstanding by saying “For if we looked for a human kingdom, we should also deny our Christ, that we might not be slain and we should strive to escape detection, that we might obtain what we expect.” (1 Apol. 11.1-2; cf. also Apol. 52; Dial. 45.4; 113.3-5; 139.5) See Charles Hill’s arguments in Regnum Caelorum: Patterns of Millennial Thought in Early Christianity. Additionally however, Philip Schaff, an amillennialist, notes that “In his two apologies, Justin teaches the usual view of the general resurrection and judgment, and makes no mention of the millennium, but does not exclude it.” Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, Vol. 2 (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, n.d.) 383. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001. Irenaeus devoted Book V of his Against Heresies to a defense of the physical resurrection and eternal judgement.Against Heresies 5.32. Other early premillennialists included Pseudo-Barnabas,”Among the Apostolic Fathers Barnabas is the first and the only one who expressly teaches a pre-millennial reign of Christ on earth. He considers the Mosaic history of the creation a type of six ages of labor for the world, each lasting a thousand years, and of a millennium of rest, since with God ‘one day is as a thousand years.’ Millennial Sabbath on earth will be followed by an eight and eternal day in a new world, of which the Lord’s Day (called by Barnabas ‘the eighth day’) is the type\\" (access The Epistle of Barnabas here). Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, Vol. 2 (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, n.d.) 382. Papias, Methodius, Lactantius,Insruct. adv. Gentium Deos, 43, 44. CommodianusAccording to the Encyclopedia of the Early Church “Commodian (mid third c.) takes up the theme of the 7000 years, the last of which is the millennium (Instr. II 35, 8 ff.).” M. Simonetti, “Millenarism,” 560. Theophilus, Tertullian,Against Marcion, book 3 chp 25 Melito,Simonetti writes in the Encyclopedia of the Early Church “We know that Melito was also a millenarian\\" regarding Jerome's reference to him as a chiliast. M. Simonetti, “Millenarism,” 560. Hippolytus of Rome and Victorinus of Pettau.Note this is Victorinus of Pettau not Marcus Piav(v)onius Victorinus the Gaelic EmperorIn his Commentary on Revelation and from the fragment De Fabrica Mundi (Part of a commentary on Genesis). Jerome identifies him as a premillennialist. By the third century there was growing opposition to premillennialism. Origen was the first to challenge the doctrine openly.“Origen (Princ. II, 2-3)) rejects the literal interpretation of Rev 20-21, gives an allegorical interpretation of it and so takes away the scriptural foundation of Millenarism. In the East: Dionysius of Alexandria had to argue hard against Egyptian communities with millenarian convictions (in Euseb. HE VII, 24-25). M. Simonetti, “Millenarism” in Encyclopedia of the Early Church, Translated by Adrian Walford, Volume 1 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), 560. It is doubtless that Origen respected apostolic tradition in interpretation. It was Origen himself who said \\"Non debemus credere nisi quemadmodum per successionem Ecclesiae Dei tradiderunt nobis\\" (In Matt., ser. 46, Migne, XIII, 1667). However as it is noted in The Catholic Encyclopedia \\"Origen has recourse too easily to allegorism to explain purely apparent antilogies or antinomies. He considers that certain narratives or ordinances of the Bible would be unworthy of God if they had to be taken according to the letter, or if they were to be taken solely according to the letter. He justifies the allegorism by the fact that otherwise certain accounts or certain precepts now abrogated would be useless and profitless for the reader: a fact which appears to him contrary to the providence of the Divine inspirer and the dignity of Holy Writ.\\" Dionysius of Alexandria stood against premillennialism when the chiliastic work, The Refutation of the Allegorizers by Nepos, a bishop in Egypt, became popular in Alexandria, as noted in Eusebius’s, Ecclesiastical History. Eusebius said of the premillennialian, Papias, that he was \\"a man of small mental capacity\\" because he had taken the Apocalypse literally.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica. 3.39.13 Practices Christian communities came to adopt some Jewish practices while rejecting others. Only Marcion proposed rejection of all Jewish practice, but he was excommunicated in Rome c. 144 and declared heretical by the growing proto-Orthodoxy. =Sabbath= According to Bauckham, the post-apostolic church contained diverse practices as regards the Sabbath. It seems clear that most of the Early Church did not consider observation of the Sabbath to be required or of eminent importance to Christians and in fact worshiped on Sunday. =Infant baptism= Infant baptism was widely practised at least by the third century,Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article Infant Baptism but it is disputed whether it was in the first centuries of Christianity. Some believe that the Church in the apostolic period practised infant baptism, arguing that the mention of the baptism of households in the Acts of the Apostles would have included children within the household.Richard Wagner, Christianity for Dummies (John Wiley & Sons 2011 ) Others believe that infants were excluded from the baptism of households, citing verses of the Bible that describe the baptized households as believing, which infants are incapable of doing. In the second century, Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons, may have referred to it.\\"He (Jesus) came to save all through means of Himself—all, I say, who through Him are born again to God and children, infants, and boys, and youths, and old men\\" (Adversus Haereses, ii, 22, 4)Paul King Jewett, Infant Baptism and the Covenant of Grace, (Eerdmans 1978), p. 127. Additionally, Justin Martyr wrote about baptism in First Apology (written in the mid-second century), describing it as a choice and contrasting it with the lack of choice one has in one's physical birth.\\"Since at our birth we were born without our own knowledge or choice, by our parents coming together, and were brought up in bad habits and wicked training; in order that we may not remain the children of necessity and of ignorance, but may become the children of choice and knowledge, and may obtain in the water the remission of sins formerly committed, there is pronounced over him who chooses to be born again, and has repented of his sins, the name of God the Father and Lord of the universe; he who leads to the laver the person that is to be washed calling him by this name alone.\\" However, Justin Martyr also seems to imply elsewhere that believers were \\"disciples from childhood\\", indicating, perhaps, their baptism. The so-called Apostolic Tradition says to \\"Baptize first the children, and if they can speak for themselves let them do so. Otherwise, let their parents or other relatives speak for them.\\" If it was written by Hippolytus of Rome, Apostolic Tradition could be dated about 215, but recent scholars believe it to be material from separate sources ranging from the middle second to the fourth century, being gathered and compiled on about 375–400. The third century evidence is clearer, with both Origen (calling infant baptism \\"according to the usage of the Church\\")Homilies on Leviticus 8.3.11; Commentary on Romans 5.9; and Homily on Luke 14.5 and Cyprian advocating the practice. Tertullian acknowledges the practice (and that sponsors would speak on behalf of the children), but, holding an unusual view of marriage, argues against it, on the grounds that baptism should be postponed until after marriage.\\"The delay of baptism is preferable; principally, however, in the case of little children. For why is it necessary ... that the sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger? ... For no less cause must the unwedded also be deferred—in whom the ground of temptation is prepared, alike in such as never were wedded by means of their maturity, and in the widowed by means of their freedom—until they either marry, or else be more fully strengthened for continence\\" (On Baptism 18). Interpretation of the baptismal practices of the early church is important to groups such as Baptists, Anabaptists, and the Churches of Christ who believe that infant baptism was a development that occurred during the late second to early third centuries. The early Christian writings mentioned above, which date from the second and third century indicate that Christians as early as the second century did maintain such a practice.\\"The Didache, representing practice perhaps as early as the beginning of the second century, probably in Syria, also assumes immersion to be normal, but it allows that if sufficient water for immersion is not at hand, water may be poured three times over the head. The latter must have been a frequent arrangement, for it corresponds with most early artistic depictions of baptism, in Roman catacombs and on sarcophagi of the third century and later. The earliest identifiable Christian meeting house known to us, at Dura Europos on the Euphrates, contained a baptismal basin too shallow for immersion. Obviously local practice varied, and practicality will often have trumped whatever desire leaders may have felt to make action mime metaphor\\" (Margaret Mary Mitchell, Frances Margaret Young, K. Scott Bowie, Cambridge History of Christianity, Vol. 1, Origins to Constantine (Cambridge University Press 2006 ), pp. 160–61). =Date of Easter= Eastern and Western Mediterranean Christians had a history of differences and disagreements dating back to the second century. Among the most significant early disagreements is the Quartodecimanism controversy. Until the late second century there was a difference in dating the celebration of the Christian Passover/Easter between Western churches and those of Asia Minor. The churches in Asia Minor celebrated it on the 14th of the Jewish month of Nisan, the day before Jewish Passover, regardless of what day of the week it fell on, as the Crucifixion had occurred on the day before Passover according to the Gospel of John. The Latins called them Quartodecimans, literally meaning 14'ers. At the time, the West celebrated Easter on the Sunday following the Jewish 14th of Nisan. Victor, the bishop of Rome, attempted to declare the Nisan 14 practice heretical and excommunicate all who followed it. On this occasion Irenaeus and Polycrates of Ephesus wrote to Victor. Irenaeus reminded Victor of his predecessor more tolerant attitude and Polycrates emphatically defended the Asian practice. Victor's \\"excommunication\\" of the Asians was apparently rescinded, and the two sides reconciled as a result of the intervention of Irenaeus and other bishops, including Tertullian. Both Tertullian and Irenaeus were pupils of Polycarp, who was a student of the Apostle John and, according to Polycarp's own written words, was also a \\"hearer\\" of the other Apostles. Polycarp was a bishop in Smyrna. Eusebius later claimed that synods and conferences of bishops were convened, which ruled \\"without a dissenting voice\\" in support of Easter on Sunday. A uniform method of computing the date of Easter was not formally addressed until 325 at the First Council of Nicaea. Today, the date still varies between West and East, but this is because the West later adopted the Gregorian calendar over the Julian calendar. =Monasticism= Institutional Christian monasticism seems to have begun in the deserts in third century Egypt as a kind of living martyrdom. Anthony the Great (251-356) was the first to specifically leave the world and live in the desert as a monk. Anthony lived as a hermit in the desert and gradually gained followers who lived as hermits nearby but not in actual community with him. One such, Paul the Hermit (also known as Paul of Thebes, c.226/7-c.341) lived in absolute solitude not very far from Anthony and was looked upon even by Anthony as a perfect monk. Paul had gone into the desert before Anthony, but to escape persecution rather than for the purpose of pursuing God. This type of monasticism is called eremitical or \\"hermit-like.\\" Pachomius of Thebes (c. 292–348) is traditionally considered the founder of cenobitic monasticism, in which monks live in communities isolated from the world but not from each other. As monasticism spread in the East from the hermits living in the deserts of Egypt to Palestine, Syria, and on up into Asia Minor and beyond, the sayings (apophthegmata) and acts (praxeis) of the Desert Fathers came to be recorded and circulated, first among their fellow monastics and then among the laity as well. =Early iconography= Christ Jesus,\\"The figure (…) is an allegory of Christ as the shepherd\\" André Grabar, \\"Christian iconography, a study of its origins\\", the Good Shepherd, third century. Christian art emerged only relatively late. According to art historian André Grabar, the first known Christian images emerge from about AD 200,Andre Grabar, p.7 though there is some literary evidence that small domestic images were used earlier. Although many Hellenised Jews seem, as at the Dura-Europos synagogue, to have had images of religious figures, the traditional Mosaic prohibition of \\"graven images\\" no doubt retained some effect. This early rejection of images, although never proclaimed by theologians, and the necessity to hide Christian practice in order to avoid persecution, leaves few archaeological records regarding Early Christianity and its evolution.Grabar, p.7 The oldest Christian paintings are from the Roman Catacombs, dated to about 200, and the oldest Christian sculptures are from sarcophagi, dating to the beginning of the third century.( Diversity and proto-orthodoxy The development of doctrine, the position of orthodoxy, and the relationship between the various opinions is a matter of continuing academic debate. Since the Nicene Creed came to define the Church, the early debates have long been regarded as a unified orthodox position against a minority of heretics. Walter Bauer, drawing upon distinctions between Jewish Christians, Pauline Christians, and other groups such as Gnostics and Marcionites, argued that early Christianity was fragmented, with various competing interpretations, only one of them eventually coming to dominate. While Bauer's original thesis has been criticised, Elaine Pagels and Bart Ehrman have further explicated the existence of variant Christianities in the first centuries. They see early Christianity as fragmented into contemporaneous competing orthodoxies. Eamon Duffy notes that Christianity throughout the Roman Empire was \\"in a state of violent creative ferment\\" during the second century. Orthodoxy, or proto- orthodoxy, existed alongside forms of Christianity that they would soon consider deviant \\"heresy\\". Duffy considers the orthodox and unorthodox were sometimes difficult to distinguish during this period, and simply says that early Christianity in Rome had a wide variety of competing Christian sects.Duffy (2002), pg. 12. Some orthodox scholars argue against the increasing focus on heterodoxy. A movement away from presuming the correctness or dominance of the orthodoxy is seen as neutral, but criticize historical analysis that assumes heterodox sects are superior to the orthodox movement.Esler (2004). pp. 893–94. =Growth of Christianity= Rodney Stark estimates that the number of Christians grew by approximately 40% a decade during the first and second centuries. This phenomenal growth rate forced Christian communities to evolve in order to adapt to their changes in the nature of their communities as well as their relationship with their political and socioeconomic environment. As the number of Christians grew, the Christian communities became larger, more numerous and farther apart geographically. The passage of time also moved some Christians farther from the original teachings of the apostles giving rise to teachings that were considered heterodox and sowing controversy and divisiveness within churches and between churches. Classical writers mistook early congregations for burial or fraternal societies which had similar characteristics like divine worship, common meals, regular meetings, initiation, rules for conduct, and their own burial grounds.Wilken, Robert L. (1984). The Christians as the Romans saw them. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 44 . =Variations in theology= The Ante- Nicene period saw the rise of a great number of Christian sects, cults and movements with strong unifying characteristics lacking in the apostolic period. They had different interpretations of Scripture, particularly different Christology—questions about the divinity of Jesus and salvation from the consequences of sin—and the nature of the Trinity. Many variations in this time defy neat categorizations, as various forms of Christianity interacted in a complex fashion to form the dynamic character of Christianity in this era. The Post-Apostolic period was extremely diverse both in terms of beliefs and practices. In addition to the broad spectrum of general branches of Christianity, there was constant change and diversity that variably resulted in both internecine conflicts and syncretic adoption.Siker (2000). Pp 233–35. These various interpretations were called heresies by the leaders of the proto-orthodox church, but many were very popular and had large followings. Part of the unifying trend in proto-orthodoxy was an increasingly harsh anti- Judaism and rejection of Judaizers. Some of the major movements were: *Gnosticism – second to fourth centuries – reliance on revealed knowledge from an unknowable God, a distinct divinity from the Demiurge who created and oversees the material world. The Gnostics claimed to have received secret teachings (gnosis) from Jesus via other apostles which were not publicly known, or in the case of Valentinius from Paul the Apostle. Gnosticism is predicated on the existence of such hidden knowledge, but brief references to private teachings of Jesus have also survived in the canonic scripture () as did warning by the Christ that there would be false prophets or false teachers. Irenaeus' opponents also claimed that the wellsprings of divine inspiration were not dried up, which is the doctrine of continuing revelation. *Marcionism – second century – the God of Jesus was a different God from the God of the Old Testament. *Montanism – second century – a pentecostal movement initiated by Montanus and his female disciples, featuring prophetic continuing revelations from the Holy Spirit. *Adoptionism – second century – Jesus was not born the Son of God, but was adopted at his baptism, resurrection or ascension. *Docetism – second to third century – Jesus was pure spirit and his physical form an illusion. *Sabellianism – third century – the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three modes of the one God and not the three separate persons of the Trinity. *Arianism – third to fourth century – Jesus, while not merely mortal, was not eternally divine and was of some lesser status than God the Father. In the middle of the second century, the Christian communities of Rome, for example, were divided between followers of Marcion, Montanism, and the gnostic teachings of Valentinus. Many groups were dualistic, maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, usually seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good. Proto-orthodox Christianity, on the other hand, held that both the material and spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good, and that this was represented in the unified divine and human natures of Christ.R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, Medieval Worlds (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58 Trinitarianism held that God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit were all strictly one being with three hypostases. =Proto-orthodoxy= Ignatius of Antioch, one of the Apostolic Fathers and the third Bishop of Antioch, was considered a student of John the Apostle. En route to his martyrdom in Rome (c. 108), Ignatius wrote a series of preserved letters which are examples of late-1st to early-second-century Christian theology. Christianity differed from other Roman religions in that it set out its beliefs in a clearly defined way,Herring, An Introduction to the History of Christianity (2006), p. 28 though the process of orthodoxy (right belief) was not underway until the period of the first seven ecumenical councils. Irenaeus was the first to argue that his \\"proto-orthodox\\" position was the same faith that Jesus gave to the twelve apostles and that the identity of the apostles, their successors, and the teachings of the same were all well-known public knowledge. This was therefore an early argument supported by apostolic succession. Irenaeus first established the doctrine of four gospels and no more, the synoptic gospels and Gospel of John. Early attacks upon alleged heresies formed the matter of Tertullian's Prescription Against Heretics (in 44 chapters, written from Rome), and of Irenaeus' Against Heresies (circa 180, in five volumes), written in Lyons after his return from a visit to Rome. The letters of Ignatius of Antioch and Polycarp of Smyrna to various churches warned against false teachers, and the Epistle of Barnabas, accepted by many Christians as part of scripture in the second century, warned about mixing Judaism with Christianity, as did other writers, leading to decisions reached at the First Council of Nicaea, which was convoked by Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325 in response to further disruptive polemical controversy within the Christian community, in that case Arian disputes over the nature of the Trinity. By the end of the third century proto-orthodoxy became dominant. It viewed Christian teachings as either orthodox or heterodox. Orthodox teachings were those that claimed to have the authentic lineage of Holy Tradition. All other teachings were viewed as deviant streams of thought and were possibly heretical. Developing Church hierarchy Irenaeus wrote On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis. In the post-Apostolic church, bishops emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations, and a hierarchy clergy gradually took on the form of episkopos (overseers, bishops), presbyters (elders), and then deacons (servants). A hierarchy within Pauline Christianity seems to have developed by the late 1st century and early second century.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. (see Pastoral Epistles, c. 90–140) Robert Williams posits that the \\"origin and earliest development of episcopacy and monepiscopacy and the ecclesiastical concept of (apostolic) succession were associated with crisis situations in the early church.\\" While Clement and New Testament writers use the terms overseer and elder interchangeably, an episcopal structure becomes more visible in the second century. Roger Haight posits the development of ecclesiology in the form of \\"Early Catholicism\\" as one response to the problem of church unity. Thus, the solution to division arising from heterodox teaching was the development of \\"tighter and more standardized structures of ministry. One of these structures is the tri-partite form of church leadership consisting of episkopoi (overseers); presbyteroi (elders),presbyter. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary – Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved 6 October 2012. as was the case with Jewish communities; and diakonoi (ministerial servants). Presbyters were ordained and assisted the bishop; as Christianity spread, especially in rural areas, the presbyters exercised more responsibilities and took distinctive shape as priests. Deacons also performed certain duties, such as tending to the poor and sick. Much of the official organizing of the ecclesiastical structure was done by the bishops of the church. This tradition of clarification can be seen as established by the Apostolic Fathers, who were bishops themselves. The Catholic Encyclopedia argues that although evidence is scarce in the second century, the primacy of the Church of Rome is asserted by Irenaeus of Lyons' document Against Heresies (AD 189).Catholic Encyclopedia: The Pope In response to second century Gnostic teaching, Irenaeus created the first known document considered to be describing apostolic succession,Langan, The Catholic Tradition (1998), p.107 including the immediate successors of Peter and Paul: Linus, Anacleutus, Clement, Evaristus, Alexander, and Sixtus.Eamon Duffy, Saints and Sinners, ch.1 The Catholic Church considers these men to be the first popes, through whom later popes would claim authority. In apostolic succession, a bishop becomes the spiritual successor of the previous bishop in a line tracing back to the apostles themselves. Over the course of the second century, this organizational structure became universal and continues to be used in the Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches as well as in some Protestant denominations. Important Church centers Jerusalem was an important church center up to 135.See, for example, Council of Jerusalem and Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem. It had the prestige of being the city of Jesus's death and reported resurrection,Catholic Encyclopedia: Jerusalem (AD 71-1099) and was the center of the Apostolic Age, but it experienced decline during the years of the Jewish–Roman wars (66-135). The First Council of Nicaea recognized and confirmed the tradition by which Jerusalem continued to be given \\"special honour\\", but did not assign to it even metropolitan authority within its own province, still less the extraprovincial jurisdiction exercised by Rome and the other sees mentioned above.\\"Since there prevails a custom and ancient tradition to the effect that the bishop of Aelia is to be honoured, let him be granted everything consequent upon this honour, saving the dignity proper to the metropolitan\\" (Canon 7). Constantinople came into prominence only after the early Christian period, being founded officially in 330, five years after the First Council of Nicaea, though the much smaller original city of Byzantium was an early center of Christianity largely due to its proximity to Anatolia. The community and seat of the patriarchate according to Orthodox tradition was founded by St Peter and then given to St. Ignatius, in what is now Turkey.  Rome and the Papacy  A scene showing Christ Pantocrator from a Roman mosaic in the church of Santa Pudenziana in Rome, c. 410 AD Irenaeus of Lyons believed in the second century that Peter and Paul had been the founders of the Church in Rome and had appointed Linus as succeeding bishop.Irenaeus Against Heresies 3.3.2: the \\"...Church founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing out] the faith preached to men, which comes down to our time by means of the successions of the bishops. ...The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate.\\" The four Eastern patriarchs affirmed Saint Peter's ministry and death in Rome and the apostolic succession of Roman bishops. However, they perceived this as a mark of honor rather than an overarching authority over belief and practices, as they still considered themselves to be the final authorities in their own regions, see for example Metropolitan bishops and Pentarchy, yet still under the overall guidance of the bishop of Rome. Other patriarchs did turn to Rome for support in settling disputes, but they also wrote to other influential patriarchs for support in the same fashion. Outside of a few notable exceptions, the body of literature left from this period, and even as late as the 5th and 6th centuries, is said by Bernhard Schimmelpfennig to illustrate the generally limited scope of the Roman bishops' authority but acknowledged the authority nonetheless.Schimmelpfennig (1992), pp. 49–50. William Kling states that by the end of second century that Rome was a significant, if not unique, early center of Christianity, but held no convincing claim to primacy. The Petrine proof text first occurs historically in a dispute between Cyprian of Carthage and Pope Stephen. A bishop from Caesarea named Firmilian sided with Cyprian in his dispute, seething against Stephen's \\"insulting arrogance\\" and claims of authority based on the See of Peter. Cyprian's argument won out the day, with Pope Stephen's claims meeting rejection.Kling (2004), pp. 64, 66. Cyprian's claim was that bishops held the keys to the forgiveness of sins, with all bishops being the successors of Saint Peter. Jerome later took up the argument for the primacy of the Roman bishop in the 5th century, a position adopted by Pope Leo I.Barrett, et al (1999), pg 116. By the end of the early Christian period, the church within the Roman Empire had hundreds of bishops, some of them (Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, \\"other provinces\\") holding some form of jurisdiction over others.Canon VI of the First Council of Nicea, which closes the period under consideration in this article, reads: \\"Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis prevail, that the Bishop of Alexandria have jurisdiction in all these, since the like is customary for the Bishop of Rome also. Likewise in Antioch and the other provinces, let the Churches retain their privileges. And this is to be universally understood, that if any one be made bishop without the consent of the Metropolitan, the great Synod has declared that such a man ought not to be a bishop ...\\" As can be seen, the title of \\"Patriarch\\", later applied to some of these bishops, was not used by the Council: \\"Nobody can maintain that the bishops of Antioch and Alexandria were called patriarchs then, or that the jurisdiction they had then was co- extensive with what they had afterward, when they were so called\\" (ffoulkes, Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, quoted in Volume XIV of Philip Schaff's The Seven Ecumenical Councils). Development of the Christian Canon P46, an early 3rd-century collection of Pauline epistles. The books of the canon of the New Testament, which includes the Canonical Gospels, Acts, letters of the Apostles, and Revelation were written before 120 AD, but not defined as \\"canon\\" by the orthodox mainstream until the 4th century. The writings attributed to the apostles circulated amongst the earliest Christian communities. The Pauline epistles were circulating in collected forms by the end of the 1st century AD. Justin Martyr, in the early second century, mentions the \\"memoirs of the apostles\\", which Christians called \\"gospels\\" and which were regarded as on par with the Old Testament.Ferguson, pp.302–303; cf. Justin Martyr, First Apology 67.3 A four gospel canon (the Tetramorph) was asserted by Ireanaeus, who refers to it directly.Ferguson, p.301; cf. Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses 3.11.8 Debates about scripture were underway in the mid-second century, concurrent with a drastic increase of new scriptures, both Jewish and Christian. Debates regarding practice and belief gradually became reliant on the use of scripture other than what Melito referred to as the Old Testament, as the New Testament canon developed. Similarly, in the third century a shift away from direct revelation as a source of authority occurred, most notably against the Montanists. \\"Scripture\\" still had a broad meaning and usually referred to the Septuagint among Greek speakers or the Targums among Aramaic speakers or the Vetus Latina translations in Carthage. Beyond the Torah (the Law) and some of the earliest prophetic works (the Prophets), there was not agreement on the canon, but this was not debated much at first. Some theorize that the split of early Christianity and Judaism in the mid-second century eventually led to the determination of a Jewish canon by the emerging rabbinic movement,White (2004). pp. 446–47. though, even as of today, there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Jewish canon was set. For example, some scholars argue that the Jewish canon was fixed earlier, by the Hasmonean dynasty (140–137 BC).Philip R. Davies, in The Canon Debate, p. 50: \\"With many other scholars, I conclude that the fixing of a canonical list was almost certainly the achievement of the Hasmonean dynasty.\\" There is a lack of direct evidence on when Christians began accepting their own scriptures alongside the Septuagint. Well into the second century Christians held onto a strong preference for oral tradition as clearly demonstrated by writers of the time, such as Papias. The oldest list of books for the New Testament canon is the Muratorian fragment dating to c. 170. It shows that by 200 there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to what is now the 27-book New Testament, which included the four gospels.H. J. De Jonge, \\"The New Testament Canon\\", in The Biblical Canons. eds. de Jonge & J. M. Auwers (Leuven University Press, 2003) p. 315 By the early 200's, Origen of Alexandria may have been using the same 27 books as in the modern New Testament, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of Hebrews, James, II Peter, II John and III John, and Revelation,Noll, pp.36-37 referred to as the Antilegomena (following Eusebius). Early orthodox writings – Church Fathers Since the end of the 4th century, the title \\"Fathers of the Church\\" has been used to refer to a more or less clearly defined group of ecclesiastical writers who are appealed to as authorities on doctrinal matters. They are the early and influential theologians and writers in the early Christian Church, who had strong influence on the development of proto- orthodoxy. They produced two sorts of works: theological and \\"apologetic\\", the latter being works aimed at defending the faith by using reason to refute arguments against the veracity of Christianity.Norman, The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History (2007), pp. 27-28 =Apologists= In the face of criticism from Greek philosophers and facing persecution, apologists wrote to justify and defend Christian doctrine. Justin Martyr's works represent the earliest surviving Christian \\"apologies\\" of notable size. =Apostolic Fathers= The earliest Church Fathers (within two generations of the Twelve apostles of Christ) are usually called the Apostolic Fathers, for reportedly knowing and having studied under the apostles personally. Important Apostolic Fathers of the second century include Pope Clement I (died 99), Ignatius of Antioch (c. 35 – c. 110), and Polycarp of Smyrna (c. 69 – c. 155). In addition, the Shepherd of Hermas is usually placed among the writings of the Apostolic Fathers although its author is unknown.For a review of the most recent editions of the Apostolic Fathers and an overview of the current state of scholarship, see Timothy B. Sailors, Ignatius of Antioch (also known as Theophorus) was the third Bishop or Patriarch of Antioch and a student of the Apostle John. En route to his martyrdom in Rome, Ignatius wrote a series of letters which have been preserved as an example of the theology of the earliest Christians. Important topics addressed in these letters include ecclesiology, the sacraments, the role of bishops, and Biblical Sabbath.EPISTLE OF IGNATIUS TO THE MAGNESIANS, chapter IX He is the second after Clement to mention Paul's epistles. Polycarp of Smyrna was a bishop of Smyrna (now İzmir in Turkey). It is recorded that he had been a disciple of John. The options for this John are John the son of Zebedee traditionally viewed as the author of the fourth Gospel, or John the Presbyter.Lake 1912 Traditional advocates follow Eusebius in insisting that the apostolic connection of Papius was with John the Evangelist, and that this John, the author of the Gospel of John, was the same as the Apostle John. Polycarp, c 156, tried and failed to persuade Anicetus, Bishop of Rome, to have the West celebrate Easter on 14 Nisan, as in the East. He rejected the pope's suggestion that the East use the Western date. In 155, the Smyrnans demanded Polycarp's execution, and he died a martyr. Legend states that the flames built to kill him refused to burn him, and that when he was stabbed to death; so much blood issued from his body that it quenched the flames around him. The Shepherd of Hermas was popular in the early church, considered a valuable book by many Christians, and considered canonical scripture by some of the early Church fathers.McDonald & Sanders, The Canon Debate, Appendix D-1 It was written at Rome, in Greek. The Shepherd had great authority in the second and third centuries.\\"The Pastor of Hermas was one of the most popular books, if not the most popular book, in the Christian Church during the second, third and fourth centuries. It occupied a position analogous in some respects to Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress in modern times.\\" (F. Crombie, translator of Schaff, op. cit.). It was cited as Scripture by Irenaeus and Tertullian and was bound with the New Testament in the Codex Sinaiticus, and it was listed between the Acts of the Apostles and the Acts of Paul in the stichometrical list of the Codex Claromontanus. Other early Christians, however, considered the work to be apocryphal. =Greek Fathers= Those who wrote in Greek are called the Greek (Church) Fathers. Famous Greek Fathers of second century (other than the Apostolic Fathers) include: Irenaeus of Lyons and Clement of Alexandria. Irenaeus of Lyons (c.130–c.202 AD) was bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul, which is now Lyons, France. His writings were formative in the early development of Christian theology, and he is recognized as a saint by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. He was a notable early apologetic. He was also a disciple of Polycarp, who was said to be a disciple of John the Evangelist. His best-known book, Against Heresies (c. 180) enumerated heresies and attacked them. Irenaeus wrote that the only way for Christians to retain unity was to humbly accept one doctrinal authority—episcopal councils. Irenaeus was the first to propose that all four gospels be accepted as canonical. Clement of Alexandria (c.150–c.215) was a Christian theologian and the head of the noted Catechetical School of Alexandria and was well-versed in pagan literature. Clement is best remembered as the teacher of Origen. He used the term \\"gnostic\\" for Christians who had attained the deeper teaching of the Logos.\\"Clement of Alexandria.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 He combined Greek philosophical traditions with Christian doctrine and developed a Christian Platonism. He presented the goal of Christian life as deification, identified both as Platonism's assimilation into God and the biblical imitation of God. According to tradition, Origen (184 – 253) was an EgyptianGeorge Sarton (1936). \\"The Unity and Diversity of the Mediterranean World\\", Osiris 2, p. 406-463 [430]. who taught in Alexandria, reviving the Catechetical School where Clement had taught. Using his knowledge of Hebrew, he produced a corrected Septuagint, and wrote commentaries on all the books of the Bible. In Peri Archon (First Principles), he articulated the first philosophical exposition of Christian doctrine. He interpreted scripture allegorically, showing Stoic, Neo-Pythagorean, and Platonic influences. Like Plotinus, he wrote that the soul passes through successive stages before incarnation as a human and after death, eventually reaching God. He imagined even demons being reunited with God. For Origen, God was not Yahweh but the First Principle, and Christ, the Logos, was subordinate to him. His views of a hierarchical structure in the Trinity, the temporality of matter, \\"the fabulous preexistence of souls,\\" and \\"the monstrous restoration which follows from it\\" were declared anathema in the 6th century.The Anathemas Against Origen, by the Fifth Ecumenical Council (Schaff, Philip, \\"The Seven Ecumenical Councils\\", Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Series 2, Vol. 14. Edinburgh: T&T; Clark)The Anathematisms of the Emperor Justinian Against Origen (Schaff, op. cit.) The patriarch of Alexandria at first supported Origen but later expelled him for being ordained without the patriarch's permission. He relocated to Caesarea Maritima and died thereAbout Caesarea after being tortured during a persecution. Hippolytus of Rome (c. 170–235 AD) was one of the most prolific writers of early Christianity. Hippolytus was born during the second half of the second century, probably in Rome. Photius describes him in his Bibliotheca (cod. 121) as a disciple of Irenaeus, who was said to be a disciple of Polycarp, and from the context of this passage it is supposed that he suggested that Hippolytus so styled himself. However, this assertion is doubtful.Cross, F. L., ed., \\"The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church\\" (Oxford University Press 2005) He came into conflict with the Popes of his time and for some time headed a separate group. For that reason he is sometimes considered the first Antipope. However he died in 235 or 236 reconciled to the Church and as a martyr. =Latin Fathers= Church Fathers who wrote in Latin are called the Latin (Church) Fathers. Tertullian (c.155–c.240 AD), who was converted to Christianity before 197, was a prolific writer of apologetic, theological, controversial and ascetic works.Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article Tertullian He wrote three books in Greek and was the first great writer of Latin Christianity, and so is sometimes known as the \\"Father of the Latin Church\\". Vincent of Lerins in 434AD, Commonitorium, 17, describes Tertullian as 'first of us among the Latins' (Quasten IV, p.549) He was evidently a lawyer in RomeCatholic Encyclopedia: Tertullian and the son of a Roman centurion. Tertullian is said to have introduced the Latin term \\"trinitas\\" with regard to the Divine (Trinity) to the Christian vocabulary (but Theophilus of Antioch already wrote of \\"the Trinity, of God, and His Word, and His wisdom\\", which is similar but not identical to the Trinitarian wording),To Autolycus, Book 2, chapter XV and also probably the formula \\"three Persons, one Substance\\" as the Latin \\"tres Personae, una Substantia\\" (itself from the Koine Greek \\"treis Hypostases, Homoousios\\"), and also the terms \\"vetus testamentum\\" (Old Testament) and \\"novum testamentum\\" (New Testament). In his Apologeticus, he was the first Latin author who qualified Christianity as the \\"vera religio\\" (true religion) and systematically relegated the classical Roman Empire religion and other accepted cults to the position of mere \\"superstitions\\". Tertullian denounced Christian doctrines he considered heretical, but later in life, Tertullian is thought by most to have joined the Montanists, a heretical sect that appealed to his rigorism. Cyprian (200-258) was bishop of Carthage and an important early Christian writer. He was probably born at the beginning of the third century in North Africa, perhaps at Carthage, where he received an excellent classical education. After converting to Christianity, he became a bishop in 249 and eventually died a martyr at Carthage. =Attitude towards women= The attitude of the Church Fathers towards women paralleled rules in Jewish law regarding a woman's role in worship, although the early church allowed women to participate in worship—something that was not allowed in the Synagogue (where women were restricted to the outer court). The Deutero-Pauline First Epistle to Timothy teaches that women should remain quiet during public worship and were not to instruct men or assume authority over them. The Epistle to the Ephesians, which is also Deutero-Pauline, calls upon women to submit to the authority of their husbands. Elizabeth A. Clark says that the Church Fathers regarded women both as \\"God's good gift to men\\" and as \\"the curse of the world\\", both as \\"weak in both mind and character\\" and as people who \\"displayed dauntless courage, undertook prodigious feats of scholarship\\". Persecutions and legalization There was no empire-wide persecution of Christians until the reign of Decius in the third century.Martin, D. 2010. \\"The \\"Afterlife\\" of the New Testament and Postmodern Interpretation (lecture transcript ). Yale University. As the Roman Empire experienced the Crisis of the Third Century, the emperor Decius enacted measures intended to restore stability and unity, including a requirement that Roman citizens affirm their loyalty through religious ceremonies pertaining to Imperial cult. In 212, universal citizenship had been granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire, and with the edict of Decius enforcing religious conformity in 250, Christian citizens faced an intractable conflict: any citizen who refused to participate in the empire-wide supplicatio was subject to the death penalty.Allen Brent, Cyprian and Roman Carthage (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 193ff. et passim; G.E.M. de Ste. Croix, Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy, edited by Michael Whitby and Joseph Streeter (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 59. Although lasting only a year,Ste. Croix, Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy, p. 107. the Decian persecution was a severe departure from previous imperial policy that Christians were not to be sought out and prosecuted as inherently disloyal.Ste. Croix, Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy, p. 40. Even under Decius, orthodox Christians were subject to arrest only for their refusal to participate in Roman civic religion, and were not prohibited from assembling for worship. Gnostics seem not to have been persecuted.Ste. Croix, Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy, pp. 139–140 Christianity flourished during the four decades known as the \\"Little Peace of the Church\\", beginning with the reign of Gallienus (253–268), who issued the first official edict of tolerance regarding Christianity.Françoise Monfrin, entry on \\"Milan,\\" p. 986, and Charles Pietri, entry on \\"Persecutions,\\" p. 1156, in The Papacy: An Encyclopedia, edited by Philippe Levillain (Routledge, 2002, originally published in French 1994), vol. 2; Kevin Butcher, Roman Syria and the Near East (Getty Publications, 2003), p. 378. The era of coexistence ended when Diocletian launched the final and \\"Great\\" Persecution in 303. The Edict of Serdica was issued in 311 by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity in the East. With the passage in AD 313 of the Edict of Milan, in which the Roman Emperors Constantine the Great and Licinius legalised the Christian religion, persecution of Christians by the Roman state ceased. Spread of Christianity Christianity spread to Aramaic-speaking peoples along the Mediterranean coast and also to the inland parts of the Roman Empire,Michael Whitby, et al. eds. Christian Persecution, Martyrdom and Orthodoxy (2006) online edition and beyond that into the Parthian Empire and the later Sasanian Empire, including Mesopotamia, which was dominated at different times and to varying extents by these empires. In AD 301, the Kingdom of Armenia became the first state to declare Christianity as its state religion, following the conversion of the Royal House of the Arsacids in Armenia. With Christianity the dominant faith in some urban centers, Christians accounted for approximately 10% of the Roman population by 300, according to some estimates.Hopkins(1998), p. 191 By the latter half of the second century, Christianity had spread east throughout Media, Persia, Parthia, and Bactria. The twenty bishops and many presbyters were more of the order of itinerant missionaries, passing from place to place as Paul did and supplying their needs with such occupations as merchant or craftsman. Various theories attempt to explain how Christianity managed to spread so successfully prior to the Edict of Milan (313). In The Rise of Christianity, Rodney Stark argues that Christianity replaced paganism chiefly because it improved the lives of its adherents in various ways. Dag Øistein Endsjø argues that Christianity was helped by its promise of a general resurrection of the dead at the end of the world which was compatible with the traditional Greek belief that true immortality depended on the survival of the body.Dag Øistein Endsjø. Greek Resurrection Beliefs and the Success of Christianity. New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2009. According to Will Durant, the Christian Church prevailed over paganism because it offered a much more attractive doctrine, and because the church leaders addressed human needs better than their rivals. Bart D. Ehrman attributes the rapid spread of Christianity to five factors: (1) the promise of salvation and eternal life for everyone was an attractive alternative to Roman religions; (2) stories of miracles and healings purportedly showed that the one Christian God was more powerful than the many Roman gods; (3) Christianity began as a grassroots movement providing hope of a better future in the next life for the lower classes; (4) Christianity took worshipers away from other religions since converts were expected to give up the worship of other gods, unusual in antiquity where worship of many gods was common; (5) in the Roman world, converting one person often meant converting the whole household—if the head of the household was converted, he decided the religion of his wife, children and slaves.

His shows revolve around the theme of complexity of love and understanding of Israel and Judaism.  Background and Performances  A British-born Oxford University graduate, Gringras is a writer, actor, singer and storyteller who now lives in Israel on Kibbutz Tuval.Looking for Robbie Gringras May 25, 2006 - David Tilman http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/3385/ Through theater and music, Robbie Gringras expresses his passion for the land of Israel (which he and his family made Aliyah to in 1996) and artistically shares his passion with his audiences. He is able to do this with his talents of directing, writing, acting, and story telling. One of his productions is called, That’s Why I’m (Still) Here, in which he tells a series of stories about his adjustment to Israel – when he moved there, the significance of why he did, and why he is still there today. His performance provides a new perspective of the land of Israel, and what it means to live there. “In the end alyiah isn’t about arriving. It’s about staying…”, he says.http://www.israelcentersf.org/tzavta/archives-israel-update.asp Gringras drew attention for his 2009 performance piece The Eighth Child, penned as a response to Caryl Churchill's controversial play, Seven Jewish Children.D.C. Jewish theater director defends reading of anti-Israel play by Aaron Leibel , Washington Jewish Weekhttp://www.thejewishchronicle.net/pages/news_nation/push?article- D-C-+Jewish-theater+director-defends+reading-of+anti- Israel+play%20&link;=push::target_page&hash;=comments_2226361&id;=2226361&instance;=secondary_stories_left_column& One of the songs he performs in this show (with friend musician, Adam Mader), is written by Ehud Banai, called Hayom, meaning \\"Today.\\" Robbie Gringras calls it an “…honest love song. When you’ve landed and you’ve moved forward to the next phase of this honest relationship.” The relationship he refers to in this sweet melody is one’s relationship with Israel, and how just like in a romance between two people, Israel can be emotionally connected with at many levels. Other stories that Gringras tells in this performance are called Kissing through a Handkerchief – what happens when two cultures clash; The Arab and the Jew – the pain and humanity of the conflict between them; Chesed and Din – the overflowing love from Israeli Chutzpah; and An Unbeliever in the Holy City – a tale of a Yom Kippur in Jerusalem. San Francisco BJE and Israel Education Initiative describe Robbie Gringras and his work, \\"Robbie's work is delightful, and of great significance in helping build intimate, honest, [and] open relations between Israel and Diaspora\\".http://www.robbiegringras.5u.com/index.html  The Goal  When asked about the main message he wishes to deliver in his shows, Gringras replied, “I don’t believe in messages. It is my belief that good art (and good education) is about setting fire to important questions, and not giving self- important answers. I also believe that good art allows for an audience to assume and to interpret many different messages. The fun of art is that many people can draw from it so many different things.” Part of Robbie Gringras’s performance art is to show Jewish people how they can connect to the land of Israel. Historically, many artists, musicians, and actors have used performance art to create interest in Israel. Similar figures who have done this include artists Theodore Bikel, Amos Oz, and David D’Or. One of the main goals of Gringras’s shows is to engage his audiences into deep thinking about their connection to Judaism and Israel. He believes it is important to motivate individuals by asking pertinent questions and not necessarily by offering what he terms, “self-important answers.” According to a May 2006 Jewish Exponent article, Gringras describes himself as, \\"an educator trying to build intimate and emotional connections to modern Israel. American Jews are having a difficult time coming to grips with the gritty reality. We have to get up close and personal with contemporary Israel\\".http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/3385/  Robbie Gringras’s Network  Robbie Gringras is also the chief editor and artist in residence of the online network, Makom. Makom is translated as “place” and in Judaism is another name for God – Its goal is to get others to recognize the necessary effort to restore and preserve where Israel stands in Jewish life. The site includes a popular and active book club, which Gringras created with musician Kobi Oz. Gringras says, “Makom believes that every Jew in the world should embrace the complexities of Israel in order to reach a deep and passionate commitment to Israel’s well-being.

The Soča flows generally southwest through the valley and then onwards to Bovec. Name The name Trenta is of Friulian origin and was borrowed into Slovene. The name developed from *Tridenta, meaning 'three-tooth' or 'divided into three teeth'. This reflects the geography because the valley splits into the Soča and Zadnjica valleys, and the latter is soon split again by White Creek (Beli Potok), creating three closely spaced summits.

He was granted a leave of absence by Pope Francis on December 13, 2019 and is expected to return to active ministry in the coming months.https://www.lincolndiocese.org/bishops/bishop-james- conley/statements/13133-press-release-and-letter-from-bishop-conley-12-12-19I Early life Raised in a Presbyterian family, James Conley was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Carl (d. 2006) and Betty Conley (b. 1923). He has one sister by adoption, Susan (b. 1962). Conley is of Wea Native American descent through his paternal grandmother's family. He and his family moved to Denver, Colorado, in 1957, and to Arvada, Colorado, in 1959. Conley attended Hoskinson Cottage School in Arvada before moving to Overland Park, Kansas, at age 8. He was a childhood friend and schoolmate of Paul S. Coakley, who became Bishop of Salina in 2004 and in 2011 was named Archbishop of Oklahoma City. Conley graduated from Shawnee Mission West High School in 1973, and then entered the University of Kansas (KU); because of his Native American heritage, the Bureau of Indian Affairs paid for a portion of his college education. He studied in KU's Integrated Humanities Program, whose courses on Greek and Roman classics led him to convert to Catholicism on December 6, 1975. Conley obtained a bachelor's degree in English literature from KU in 1977, and then worked in construction in Kansas City, Kansas before traveling through Europe. Like Paul Coakley, he also considered a monastic vocation at the Abbey of Notre Dame de Fontgombault in France. Conley returned to the United States in 1978, and worked on a friend's farm near Courtland, Kansas. Following the 1979 visit of Pope John Paul II to the United States, he decided to pursue a vocation to the priesthood and entered St. Pius X Seminary in Erlanger, Kentucky, in 1980. He later studied at Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland, where he earned a master's degree in divinity in 1985. Priesthood Conley was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Wichita on May 18, 1985, and then served as associate pastor at St. Patrick Church. In 1989, he was sent by Bishop Eugene J. Gerber in to further his studies in Rome, where he earned a licentiate in moral theology from the Alphonsian Academy of the Pontifical Lateran University. Upon his return to the United States in 1991, Conley became chaplain of the Newman Center at Wichita State University and diocesan director of the Respect Life Office. His parents also converted to Catholicism in 1991, and it was Conley who administered the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation to them. In 1996, he returned to Rome to serve as an official of the Congregation for Bishops in the Roman Curia. During this period, Conley also served as chaplain at the University of Dallas' Rome campus (1997-2003) and as adjunct instructor of theology at Christendom College's Rome campus (2004-2006). He was raised to the rank of Chaplain of His Holiness by John Paul II on February 9, 2001. Returning to the Diocese of Wichita in 2006, he was named pastor of Blessed Sacrament Church. Episcopal careerAuxiliary Bishop of Denver= On April 10, 2008, Conley was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Denver, Colorado, and titular Bishop of Cissa by Pope Benedict XVI. He was consecrated on May 30 by Archbishop Charles Chaput, O.F.M. Cap., with Bishop Michael Jackels of Wichita and Archbishop Paul S. Coakley of Oklahoma City serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception. His episcopal motto, \\"Cor Ad Cor Loquitur (Latin: \\"Heart Speaks To Heart\\"), is taken from the motto of English cardinal and fellow Catholic convert John Henry Newman. Speaking on proposed health care legislation in November 2009, Conley stated that Catholic bishops \\"have a few simple but important priorities. First, everyone should have access to basic health care, including immigrants...Second, reform should respect the dignity of every person, from conception to natural death... Third, real healthcare reform needs to include explicit, ironclad conscience protections for medical professionals and institutions so that they cannot be forced to violate their moral convictions. Fourth--and this is so obvious it sometimes goes unstated--any reform must be economically realistic and financially sustainable.\\" In September 2011, when Charles Chaput was appointed Archbishop of Philadelphia, Conley became Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese of Denver. He remained until July 2012, when Bishop Samuel Aquila of Fargo was named Chaput's successor. =Bishop of Lincoln= On September 14, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Conley as Bishop of Lincoln, Nebraska, succeeding Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz. He was installed on November 20, 2012, at the Cathedral of the Risen Christ.http://journalstar.com/news/local/diocese- of-lincoln-installs-james-conley-as-ninth-bishop/article_8fff76cc- cfb6-5354-8354-8c4d873cd299.html The Lincoln diocese participated in the first of the U.S. bishops’ audit of the implementation of the youth-protection charter in 2003, but then-Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz declined to participate again while awaiting refinements to the process. In June 2014, the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' National Review Board for the protection of children reported that Conley's diocese was one of four in the United States that had yet to comply with the USCCB's charter requiring every diocese to submit its procedures for the protection of children to the Review Board for an audit. According to a 2015 statement by Conley, the Lincoln Diocese complied with all church and civil laws on child-abuse reporting and child protection; he stated that the audit process had been improved, and that the diocese would now participate. On December 13, 2019, Conley announced that he is taking a medical leave of absence to treat depression, anxiety, insomnia, and tinnitus. Archbishop George Joseph Lucas, Archbishop of Omaha, was appointed to serve as apostolic administrator during Bishop Conley’s temporary leave of absence.

He also established the landmark line of \\"White Ace\\" stamp albums. ArtCraft became one of the world's most popular cachets. Albums and cachets In 1933 Leo and his brother Samuel formed the Washington Stamp Exchange on Washington Street in Newark, New Jersey. In 1939 they established the Washington Press, which created and sold White Ace album pages for collectors. They also printed and sold high-quality envelopes bearing an Artcraft (later \\"ArtCraft\\") cachet of each anticipated United States stamp to be issued, so that stamp collectors could have the envelope franked and canceled by the post office with a “first day of issue” cancellation. Philatelic philanthropy Leo and his brother were very interested in expanding the hobby of collecting first day covers and helped found the American First Day Cover Society in 1955 and supported it financially during its early years. He also helped create interest for the hobby of first day covers by instituting awards at various stamp shows and exhibitions. Leo was a benefactor of the Smithsonian Institution's National Postal Museum in Washington, D.C. and American Philatelic Society in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and one of the founders of the Cardinal Spellman Philatelic Museum on the campus of Regis College in Weston, Massachusetts. Honors and awards Leo received numerous honors for his work in the field of philately. He was awarded the Luff Award in 1990 by the American Philatelic Society for outstanding contributions to philately, and was named Man of the Year in 1997 by the American First Day Cover Society. In 1998 he was named to the American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame.

The standard aims to prevent developed payment applications for third parties from storing prohibited secure data including magnetic stripe, CVV2, or PIN. In that process, the standard also dictates that software vendors develop payment applications that are compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). Ultimately PA-DSS and its validation program will be incorporated into the PCI Software Security Framework. It is planned that PA-DSS will be retired in late 2022 once the expiry dates of payment applications validated to PA-DSS v3.2 is reached. Requirements For a payment application to be deemed PA-DSS compliant, software vendors must ensure that their software includes the following fourteen protections: # Do not retain full track data, card verification code or value (CAV2, CID, CVC2, CVV2), or PIN block data. # Protect stored cardholder data. # Provide secure authentication features. # Log payment application activity. # Develop secure payment applications. # Protect wireless transmissions. # Test payment applications to address vulnerabilities and maintain payment application updates. # Facilitate secure network implementation. # Cardholder data must never be stored on a server connected to the Internet. # Facilitate secure remote access to payment application. # Encrypt sensitive traffic over public networks. # Secure all non-console administrative access. # Maintain a PA-DSS Implementation Guide for customers, resellers, and integrators. # Assign PA-DSS responsibilities for personnel, and maintain training programs for personnel, customers, resellers, and integrators. Governance and enforcement PCI SSC has compiled a list of payment applications that have been validated as PA-DSS compliant, with the list updated to reflect compliant payment applications as they are developed. Creation and enforcement of these standards currently rests with PCI SSC via Payment Application-Qualified Security Assessors (PA-QSA). PA-QSAs conduct payment application reviews that help software vendors ensure that applications are compliant with PCI standards. History Governed originally by Visa Inc., under the PABP moniker, PA-DSS was launched on April 15, 2008 and updated on October 15, 2008. PA-DSS then became retroactively distinguished as \\"version 1.1\\" and \\"version 1.2\\". In October 2009, PA-DSS v1.2.1 was released with three noted changes: # Under “Scope of PA-DSS,” align content with the PA-DSS Program Guide, v1.2.1, to clarify applications to which PA-DSS applies. # Under Laboratory Requirement 6, corrected spelling of “OWASP.” # In the Attestation of Validation, Part 2a, update “Payment Application Functionality” to be consistent with the application types listed in the PA-DSS Program Guide, and clarify annual re-validation procedures in Part 3b. In October 2010, PA-DSS 2.0 was released, indicating: Update and implement minor changes from v1.2.1 and align with new PCI DSS v2.0. For details, please see PA-DSS – Summary of Changes from PA-DSS Version 1.2.1 to 2.0. In November 2013, PA-DSS 3.0 was released, indicating: Update from PA-DSS v2. For details of changes, please see PA-DSS – Summary of Changes from PA-DSS Version 2.0 to 3.0.Summary of Changes from PA-DSS Version 2.0 to 3.0 In May 2015, PA-DSS 3.1 was released indicating:Update from PA-DSS v3.0. See PA-DSS – Summary of Changes from PA-DSS Version 3.0 to 3.1 for details of changes.Summary of Changes from PA-DSS Version 3.0 to 3.1 In May 2016, version 3.2 of the PA-DSS Program Guide and Standards were released. For details, see Summary of Changes from PA-DSS Version 3.1 to 3.2. Congressional attention On March 31, 2009, the United States House of Representatives’ Committee on Homeland Security convened to discuss the current PCI DSS requirements. Representatives such as Yvette Clark (D-NY) expressed interest in increasing the strength of standards while others, such as Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) expressed doubt that industry created standards would be sufficient in the future.Visa, MasterCard In Security Hotseat While Congressional attention was focused largely on PCI DSS, the criticism of card-issuer standards could eventually bring Congressional or legal focus on PA-DSS and on PCI SSC as an entity. Future The future of these standards is somewhat vague, with Congressional attention giving rise to the possibility of governmental intervention. Regardless, meeting standards can prove expensive and time consuming for software vendors, with the current expense of PA-DSS certification outpacing other methods of compliance. Given the cost of compliance and certification, current or yet-undetermined alternatives could emerge in the PCI standards compliance market. Visa USA announced a more aggressive push into such technology (chip and pin) in August 2011.

It is on the east side of a dirt road, south of South Carolina State Highway 17-34, north of South Carolina State Highway 17-155, and about east of the intersection of South Carolina State Highway 17-22 and South Carolina State Highway 155. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 1984. History Bright tobacco was introduced in South Carolina in the 1880s and 1890s. This grows well in the sandy, loamy soils of the Pee Dee and is flue-cured. The traditional barns had one or two fireboxes using wood or coal. In the 1950s, many barns were changed to gas or oil heat for better temperature regulation. Tobacco leaves were strung onto tobacco poles that were laid across horizontal tier poles in the barn. There were three drying stages. The first stage at to yellowed the leaves. In the second stage, the temperature was raised to to to dry the leaves. The final stage was at to to dry the stems. Description The barn is rectangular with a metal gable roof and a brick foundation. The walls up to the eaves are sawn timber. The timbers are notched at the corners and have mortar chinking. The gable ends are covered with horizontal weatherboarding. There are small rectangular doors in the gables that can be opened for ventilation. On the south and east sides, there are metal shed roofs supported by posts. These sheds provided shade for stringing leaves. The east and west sides have small doors at ground level. The name \\"J. L. King\\" and the date \\"1942\\" are scratched into the chinking. The barn was divided into five \\"rooms\\" or \\"bents\\" by wooden tier poles. On the south end, there is a brick, double-arched firebox that has been bricked in. As can be seen in other photographs, the fuel was later changed to gas. At the time of its nomination, it was said to be no longer used as a tobacco barn, but was considered the most intact tobacco barn in Dillon and Marion counties built between 1895 and the 1950s. It was also described as an \\"extremely fragile resource.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in South Carolina Category:Barns on the National Register of Historic Places in South Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Dillon County, South Carolina Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1942 Category:Buildings and structures in Dillon County, South Carolina Category:Tobacco buildings in the United States Category:Agriculture in South Carolina Category:1942 establishments in South Carolina Category:Barns in South Carolina ","title":"Smith Tobacco Barn"},{"id":"22765886","text":"Laurence \\"Larry\\" Flaherty (26 May 1882 - 5 January 1979) was an Irish sportsperson.

The concert film Road to Austin was recorded on May 19, 2007, when Bruton and many of his musical friends performed for 20,000 people in Austin, Texas. The film was released in 2014, and includes interviews with Bruton and others. In 2008, Bruton was diagnosed with cancer. His friends thought some time in the studio might be a welcome distraction. Dubbing themselves Geoff Muldaur And The Texas Sheiks, Geoff Muldaur (guitar, vocals), Cindy Cashdollar (dobro), Suzy Thompson (fiddle), Johnny Nicholas (guitar) and Bruce Hughes (bass) joined Bruton in the studio for a pair of recording sessions. Bruton died in May 2009; however, the album was released September 22, 2009, on the Tradition & Moderne label. He made appearances in films and television, as well, and he co-wrote and performed with Burnett much of the music in the 2009 country music film Crazy Heart, which was released in December and dedicated to Bruton's memory. On Kristofferson's 2009 release Closer to the Bone, Bruton is credited with playing bass and mandolin and providing backing vocals. Kristofferson noted: \\"This album is dedicated to the spirit of my soul-brother Stephen Bruton and his unique legacy of music and laughter that has enriched our lives.\\" In June 2012, Little Feat released Rooster Rag (Hot Tomato/Rounder Records), containing a collaboration, \\"Just A Fever\\", that he wrote with group guitarist Paul Barrere.

The paired two-light bell-chamber windows have Somerset tracery flanked by attached shafts and pinnacles, with quatrefoil grilles. There are similar single windows on the stage below. On the stonework are hunky punks representing dragons with the one on the left side of the west face being a mixture between a Basilisk or Cockatrice and a Griffin.

Its creation dates back to the early 1900s and it has remained on the same hillside ever since. Origin of the \\"P\\" The “P” has been at the university since at least 1919, but its exact origin has been debated.http://virtualslo.com/attractions/Attraction.php?id=7 One story of its birth is that Cal Poly San Luis Obispo’s students and administration wanted to present the school to the rest of the community by placing a “P” for Poly on the campus hillside. A lot of thought was put into the idea of whether to use a water tower with a “P” painted on it, or to construct a giant “P”. The idea of the “P” on the hillside won because of the expensive costs of purchasing a water tower. It was purposely placed in a spot that could be viewed from three specific locations: the administration building’s porch, the newly constructed Highway 101, and the air, as flying was becoming popular.Traditions - Cal Poly Another theory of the origin of the “P” is that it was constructed as a result of a rivalry between Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and San Luis Obispo High School. A 1919 issue of the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student newspaper, The Polygram, states that one morning Poly students awoke to discover large “H’s” (for High) constructed out of stones on the hills surrounding San Luis Obispo. The Poly students changed each “H” to a “P”, and the high school students battled back, again changing the letters. Poly students began to concentrate their defense on a hillside overlooking the campus where the “P” has graced the hill ever since.The Poly P Construction The first recorded “P” to adorn the hillside was made simply of whitewashed stones. This was problematic because the wind and rain would wash the stones away. The stones also made it easy for the high school students to change the “P” to an “H”. Under the supervision of the sophomores, the freshmen dorm boys maintained the 24-by-40 foot “P”, tidying up its stone outline and refilling it when needed. > Our class this year has quite a few young boys [who] are small in stature, > but not in willpower. We held our own in the lining of … the Block P on the > hill. Hauling the lime up the hill is no joke, but we didn't balk, just went > right on hauling and lining. Maybe we are little, but we'll grow up some day > and make mighty Seniors. — 1928 El Rodeo'' The second “P” was constructed out of old, whitewashed barn doors by the Block “P” club. Again, this “P” was short-lived due to high school students who lit it on fire. Until plans were complete to build a concrete “P” on the hill, the letter was reconstructed from wood. The concrete “P” was also built by the Block “P” club and was overseen by then student body president, Harry Wineroth. The new “P” was 40 feet tall and 30 feet wide, much larger than its predecessors. By 1956 the “P” was in shambles and in desperate need of repair. The social fraternity, Delta Sigma Phi and a group of agricultural engineering students stepped in to help build a long-lasting “P”. On May 3, 1957 the two groups finished construction on the new “P”. This is the same “P” that can be seen on the campus hillside today.polyHistory Maintenance Traditions It was decided that the maintenance of the “P” would lie in the hands of the freshman and sophomore classes in the form of a contest dubbed “The Freshman Sophomore Brawl”. The contest featured events such as tug-of-war, three-legged races and talent shows. The loser of the two classes would be the ones to maintain the structure. The sophomores usually won, leaving the “P” in the hands of the freshmen.P is for Pride The “P” was a perfect target for school rivals to attack. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo’s biggest rivalry was Fresno State. Each year, on the night before the big football game, Fresno State students would climb up to the “P” and change it to an “F”. In response, freshman began to have bonfires outside of their dormitories and take shifts guarding the “P”. There were even rumors that one year Poly students placed explosives around the “P” to keep it safe. > One Friday night hours after the lights were out … there were rumors … that > the school we were playing on Saturday was going to deface the P. While > trying to wake another friend, I was met by Captain Deuel [the dorm > monitor]. He shone his flash[light] in my face and wanted to know what was > going on … half the dorm was AWOL. When I told him … he said, Wake your > friends and get up there … but spread the word — Don't step one foot off the > campus. -Don Fulwider, class of 1925'' As the campus population grew, “The Brawl” became less popular. As a result, a spirit organization, The Rally Club, formed in 1957 to maintain the “P”. On the day before a football game, the club would carry a generator up the trail to the “P” and light the monument. If Poly won the game, the following night the Rally Club would replace the “P” with a “V” for victory. This tradition continued up until the late 1970s when interest dropped and the club ended. For about 13 years the “P” sat on the hill with no steady caretakers. Weathering and vandalism began to take its toll on the “P”, causing it to slowly decay. Many claimed that the “P” was a nuisance and an eyesore, and a petition to get rid of the “P” circulated. The petition received more than 1000 signatures, stirring a debate among students and alumni. Hostility against the “P” escalated as the school was unable to deter the vandalism. In 1994 a spirit organization, Running Thunder, was formed to take care of the “P” and to promote school pride. They cleaned, painted, and lit the “P”. The club, now called the Mustang Maniacs, continues to take care of the “P” and paint it about three times every year. Clubs are permitted to paint the \\"P\\" provided they obtain permission from the Mustang Maniacs and repaint it to its standard white within a reasonable time. The \\"P\\" has started sliding down the slope of the hill and is suffering from some stress fractures due to the movement. Controversy Decorating the “P” and using it to spread messages is a long-standing campus tradition. In 1964, the “P” was transformed into “GOP”. In the 1970s it was changed to “POT”. In the 1980s “SPRINGSTEEN” appeared on the hillside. The “P” has been formed into the Greek letters of the sororities and fraternities on campus. Even marriage proposals have been spelled out using the “P”. Throughout its history the “P” has been painted numerous times as well. In a response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the campus painted the concrete letter with the stars and stripes of the American flag.http://calpolynews.calpoly.edu/news_releases/2002/2002_news_releases/02archives_students/thunder.html, For bicentennial, it was painted red, white, and blue. It has been painted with hearts for Valentine's Day and red and green for Christmas. Zebra stripes have even been painted across its face. The Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals United and Pride Alliance Center painted it like a rainbow during commUNITY pride week. Immediately a group of 15 to 20 students were caught with “John Deere green” paint trying to cover up the rainbow. The Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals United and Pride Alliance Center painted another rainbow over the green, yet students continued to paint over it. It became an ongoing cycle that triggered debate. The gay activists received permission to paint the \\"P\\" rainbow from the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Mustang booster club, the Running Thunder club, and the keepers of the concrete “P”. The students who painted over the rainbow did not get permission to do so. > \\"It's so much more than a prank. They want to shut us up.” -Mike Sullivan, a > computer engineering major and former president of Gays, Lesbians and > Bisexuals United As the controversy around the rainbow grew, minority students and professors held a march to protest Cal Poly San Luis Obispo’s lack of diversity and tolerance.Cal Poly's Letter P Target of Backlash - Los Angeles Times References Category:California Polytechnic State University ","title":"The &quot;P&quot; (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo)"},{"id":"22766020","text":"Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum is a Hungarian mathematical journalSCImago journal report, Acta Sci.

Canadian-born, Brownstone was the Associated Press Food Editor from 1947 to 1986—for thirty-nine years. During that time she was the most widely published of syndicated food writers. The five recipe columns and two food features she wrote for the Associated Press each week appeared in papers all over the United States, in addition to a number of other countries. Brownstone's personal papers and cookbook collection is the unique expression of her personal interest in and encyclopedic knowledge of American culinary history and cookbooks, and her career in the food field.  Background  She was born in Plum Coulee, Manitoba, in 1909, growing up in Winnipeg, the fourth of five sisters. She attended the University of Manitoba and came to New York City to pursue her studies and to work. She lived in Greenwich Village, appropriately enough in a brownstone house, in a duplex apartment that included a spectacular test kitchen, and that housed her large cookbook collection. Early in her career as a journalist, Brownstone was the Food Editor of Parents magazine and the Child Care Editor of Family Circle magazine.  Other work  Brownstone was also a consultant to Carl Sontheimer, president of Cuisinart, a physicist, entrepreneur, and founder of the food processor industry in America. With Sontheimer, Brownstone edited the highly regarded magazine, Pleasures of Cooking, and wrote Classic Cakes and Other Great Cuisinart Desserts in 1994. She also wrote a book for children, All Kinds of Mothers, illustrated by her niece, the artist Miriam Brofsky Kley. In 1972 she came out with Cecily Brownstone's Associated Press Cookbook.  Food writers as friends  Cecily Brownstone was a close friend and confidant of James Beard and Joy of Cooking authors, Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Rombauer Becker, and other noted cookbook and food writers. She and Beard phoned each other almost daily, at 8 a.m., and their friendship is mentioned in two recent biographies of Beard. Brownstone's collection includes 93 letters and postcards from Irma Rombauer and about 45 of Marion Becker's letters. During the last five years of Becker's life she phoned Brownstone for an hour every weekend; they were close friends, and Brownstone is mentioned often in Anne Mendelson's recent biography of Irma Rombauer and her daughter. Brownstone's collection includes signed, inscribed copies of almost every edition of Joy of Cooking, sent to her first by Irma Rombauer, and later by Marion Becker. The New York Times food columnist Molly O'Neil called Brownstone one of the \\"cornerstones of authentic cooking in New York.\\" Upon Brownstone's retirement, former New York Times Food Editor Jane Nickerson wrote: \\"Of syndicated food writers, she's been the most widely read.\\" Nickerson added: Brownstone's recipes were always \\"unusual, appetizing, and accurate down to the last one-eighth of a teaspoon of salt.\\" Brownstone's \\"success derived, in my view, from her sensitivity to readers' tastes and her insistence that recipes give high, appealing results.\\" Brownstone died in 2005 in New York City.

Cullen Building, usually shortened in pronunciation as the E. Cullen Building, is a building that serves as the administrative headquarters of the University of Houston and the University of Houston System. It is named in honor of Ezekiel Wimberly Cullen, a former congressman of the Republic of Texas, and grandfather of building financier Hugh Roy Cullen. The building was designed by Texas architect Alfred C. Finn in the Art Deco style, and opened in 1950. It is located in the Cullen Family Plaza of the University of Houston campus in Houston, and is iconic to the image of the university. The east portion of the E. Cullen Building constitutes the Cullen Performance Hall, while the west portion houses the office of the President of the University of Houston as well as other administrative offices. History The construction of the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building was announced by the university on March 21, 1945. The construction of the E. Cullen Building was part of a large expansion to the University of Houston's permanent buildings on campus that took place starting on May 10, 1948, and the official groundbreaking ceremony occurred on May 14, 1948. The main donor to the project was philanthropist and university chairman Hugh Roy Cullen, who requested that the building be named after his grandfather Ezekiel Wimberly Cullen. The elder Cullen had served as a leader of the Republic of Texas as a congressman and also as a justice of the Supreme Court of the Republic. While in the Third Congress of the republic as chairman of the education committee, he also sponsored the \\"Cullen Act\\", which started land endowments for schools and universities. The act effectively lay the basis for an eventual state public school system. The university hired native Houston architect Alfred C. Finn to design the building. In order to give the building a classical look, Finn designed the building with long wings and regularly spaced pilasters. The building officially opened on Halloween of 1950. The building includes \\"Three portrait reliefs in gilded bronze of the Cullen family\\" by sculptor Mario Korbel dedicated in 1952.Proske, Beatrice Gilman, Brookgreen Gardens Sculpture, Brookgreen Gardens, SC, 1968 p. 232 Several years later, the building became home to the first public television station, KUHT. The station commenced broadcasting on May 25, 1953, from the fifth floor of the E. Cullen Building. KUHT moved to studios on Cullen Boulevard in 1964. In 1959, a fire broke out in the E. Cullen Building, which caused severe interior and exterior damage to the building. The damage was repaired. Gallery File:EWCullen1.jpgEzekiel W.

Extra wings have been added since the hospital opened, including a self-contained orthopaedic unit and new Eye, Ear and Mouth Unit in 2003 (replacing the Ear, Nose and Throat clinic that was based at Maidstone Ophthalmic Hospital (now closed) in Maidstone town centre) and the Peggy Wood Breast Care Centre in 2004. The £2m Emergency Care Centre, which was one of the first of its kind in the country to offer full A&E; services, a GP out-of-hours service and a walk-in centre under one roof, opened in 2005. The Kent Oncology Centre, a specialist centre which provides cancer services for the local area, installed state of the art radiotherapy equipment in 2017. Superbug outbreak In 2007, the local NHS trust and Maidstone Hospital were involved in a scandal when 90 patients at the hospital may have died as a direct result of contracting the superbug c-diff in an outbreak that began in 2006. A subsequent investigation found these infections to be the result of dirty and overcrowded conditions at the hospital. The report also revealed that the outbreak contributed to a further 240 deaths, although the report does not note if this would have changed the outcome for these patients. More than 1,150 people were ultimately infected. Just before the report was published, the Maidstone & Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust dismissed their \\"blameless\\" Chief Executive \\"both unlawfully .. and unfairly\\" and agreed to pay her £250,000, much less than the sum that they were told that defending a case for unfair dismissal would cost. When the proposed payment became known, the Secretary of State for Health, Alan Johnson intervened and the Department of Health ordered the trust to withhold more than two-thirds of the severance payment, although its director general of finance, performance and operations said that \\"it was 'not unfair'\\" that she should receive the money. When the case came to the Court of Appeal, the payment was restored in a judgement that was highly critical of the Trust's behaviour, saying \\"there had been no good reason to dismiss the CEO; and that all this money, both compensation and costs, could have been spent on improving hygiene and patient care in the Trust's hospitals.\\" After the publication of the report, all of the Trust's board resigned.

Institute for International Sport Investigation  A March 4, 2012 article, \\"Shadowed by Debt\\" by Katherine Gregg of the Providence Journal provided a detailed look at the unconventional relationship Dan Doyle had formed with the University of Rhode Island with the blessing of many top officials. The article cited numerous internal memos and documents obtained by the Journal showing a history back to the mid 1980s when the Institute first appeared at the University.Shadowed by Dept by Katherine Gregg Providence Journal March 4, 2012 The Providence Journal reported Doyle had been acquiring properties on Bald Head Island, NC. Reporter Tom Mooney travelled to the island where Doyle's nonprofit Institute for International Sport had acquired two vacation homes and four house lots for $2.95 million. Doyle also bought a house lot on his own and four more through a partnership with his Bates College classmate, Deborah Burch, who records show, lives about three hours away in Durham, NC. The purchases totaled $1.39 million.Promise of profits lured many to buy up island's properties. Tom Mooney Providence Journal March 4, 2012 On March 14, 2012 the Providence Journal reported ex-staffers of the Institute for International Sport said Dan Doyle had used Institute funds to pay for his daughters college tuition at Oberlin College another other personal expenses including credit card bills.Ex-staffers say Doyle tapped Institute Funds. Mike Stanton Providence Journal March 14, 2012 On April 21, 2012 University of Rhode Island President David M. Dooley told the Providence Journal the University will hire a consultant to conduct a “comprehensive review” of relationships the university has with outside organizations and a lawyer to help URI deal with the probe of the Institute for International Sport. Dooley said he still wants the “independent examination of the university’s relationship and transactions with the Institute for International Sport,” which he announced in February and then put on hold at the urging of the state police. But that, he said, will come later. “As I have stated previously, we will not compromise the ongoing investigation by the state police. Our own important review will proceed once the work of law enforcement is complete,” he said Friday. “It has been my experience over the past three years that occurrences such as those associated with the Institute for International Sport are the exception at URI,” Dooley said in his statement.URI seeking outside review Katherine Gregg Providence Journal April 21,2012 On June 1, 2012 the Associated Press reported URI had hired Providence attorney John \\"Terry\\" MacFadyen to assist URI's own lawyer with any legal issues pertaining to the Institute for International Sport. URI said through a spokeswoman MacFadyen would be paid $200/hr.URI retains lawyer to advise on Institute. Associated Press June 1, 2012 February 12, 2013 a year after the scandal first broke, the Providence Journal reported the University of Rhode Island hasn't begun their promised probes of the Institute for International Sport. A year after the state police began investigating Daniel Doyle and his Institute for International Sport, the University of Rhode Island has not yet launched either of the in-depth probes its president promised in the early days of the scandal. One was canceled; the other has yet to get off the ground. URI President David M. Dooley promised in February 2012 to bring in an outsider to conduct an “independent, impartial examination” of the school's relationship with the Institute. But days later, Dooley reversed course, saying it would hold off on its inquiry until “the work of law enforcement is complete.” University yet to start probes of Institute Katherine Gregg Providence Journal Feb 12, 2013 WPRI 12 reported on February 26, 2014 the Sports Institute lost its Tax Exempt status last year according to IRS however a website for the Institute indicates the organization is still accepting donations. WPRI also reported URI has leased the land the Institute buildings sit on to the Institute until 2017 for $1. The Institute owns the buildings. \\"We wanted to ask Doyle about whether the Institute was still receiving donations. The vehicle he was seen driving was parked in a handicapped spot in front of the Institute’s office in Kingston, indicating he was in the building. No one answered the door, but Doyle did acknowledge us from the second floor. He then closed the window with a chuckle.\\"http://wpri.com/2014/02/26/dan-doyles-sports-website-still-asking- for-donations/ Arrest Dan Doyle was arrested and indicted on May 3, 2013, in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island State Police, and accused by the Rhode Island Attorney General's office of embezzling more than $1 million from his foundation, the Institute for International Sport. An article in the Hartford Courant by Matthew Kauffman reports on claims by the prosecutors that Doyle is responsible for massive embezzlement at the Institute for International Sport and claiming ties to various figures including the Irish government which do not actually exist. Doyle is fighting the charges at this time. Doyle was indicted on 18 counts.State of Rhode Island v. Daniel E. Doyle Jr. February 22, 2014 Providence Journal reports more than 90 potential witnesses may be called at the trial including many prominent political figures, businessmen and university officials. The list includes former URI president Robert Carothers, current state Director of Administration Richard Licht, former House speaker William Murphy, former attorney general Patrick Lynch, former congressman and URI administrator Robert Weygand and philanthropist Alan Hassenfeld, the former CEO of toy maker Hasbro who was once the Institute's biggest supporter. The list also includes former state senator John Revens, former Senate president now Judge Joseph Montabano, former Democratic Party chairman William J. Lynch, who did legal work for the Institute, dozens of URI finance and administration officials, and a host of former Institute employees.

The settlement was mentioned in the 2nd century Antonine Itinerary, which described it as lying 12 miles from Uxacona (near present-day Oakengates) and 12 miles from Letocetum (Wall, near Lichfield). The exact site of Pennocrucium was identified only after aerial photography revealed cropmarks in 1946, and excavations were conducted by Kenneth St Joseph over subsequent years. Pennocrucium was an important road junction on Watling Street – the main Roman road across the Midlands to Viroconium Cornoviorum (Wroxeter) – and was situated 700 metres east of its crossing of the River Penk, with roads leading north to Mediolanum (Whitchurch) and south in the direction of Greensforge near Kinver and Metchley Fort in Birmingham. The main civilian defensive site or burgi was a rectangular enclosure approximately from north to south and from east to west, lying astride Watling Street and surrounded by three ditches. There may have been a civilian vicus around the defended settlement, possibly forming a ribbon development along Watling Street. to the north east of the civilian settlement lay a large double-ditched enclosure identified as a possible Vexillation fortress, with two smaller forts lying south east of the settlement and north of Watling Street on the opposite bank of the Penk.

Held: *The taxpayer (a public elementary school principal) had to include in gross income the value of unsolicited sample textbooks, sent to him by publishers, when he subsequently donated them to the school's library and claimed a charitable deduction. I.R.C.1954 §§ 61, 170. Case BriefFacts= During the years 1967 and 1968 Charles N. Haverly was the principal of the Alice L. Barnard Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois. In each of these years publishers sent to the taxpayer unsolicited sample copies of textbooks which had a total fair market value at the time of receipt of $400. In 1968 Haverly donated the books to the Alice L. Barnard Elementary School Library. The parties agreed that the donation entitled the taxpayer to a charitable deduction under 26 U.S.C. § 170, in the amount of $400, the value of the books at the time of the contribution.https://openjurist.org/513/f2d/224/haverly-v-united-states =Issue= The issue in this case was \\"whether the value of unsolicited sample textbooks sent by publishers to a principal of a public elementary school, which he subsequently donated to the school's library and for which he claimed a charitable deduction, constitutes gross income to the principal within the meaning of Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. § 61.\\" https://openjurist.org/513/f2d/224/haverly-v-united-states =Holding= Haverly cannot take a charitable contribution deduction for donating books that he himself never purchased.

Subsequent developments Following this decision, Congress enacted Rev. Rule. 70-498, which prevents double dipping of both deducted and charitable donations. Academic Commentary It seems strange to permit a party to exclude a receipt and also deduct its value. Nevertheless, the court barred neither—but it accompanied the charitable deduction with income realization at an equal amount. Here are the reasons it chose this approach: *the court had to permit exclusion in the first instance, because of hardship to lower-paid persons of paying cash for kind (even though gross income includes any accession to wealth, including unasked for samples) *the court also had to permit the deduction because the code [absent today's §170(e)(1)] authorized a deduction for the full value of donated property (even though a charitable deduction should not exceed the taxpayer's basis) ReferencesExternal links Category:United States taxation and revenue case law Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit cases Category:1975 in United States case law ","title":"Haverly v.

The World War II Combat Film - Anatomy of a Genre. Wesleyan University Press. p. 241. Plot U.S. Marine Master Gunnery Sergeant James O'Hearn (Burt Lancaster) is being tried at the San Diego Marine base for desertion, theft, scandalous conduct and destruction of property in time of war. He refuses to testify or plead guilty or not guilty to the charges. The film alternates between flashbacks and the courtroom, as witnesses give their testimony. Showgirl Ginger Martin (Virginia Mayo) takes the stand against his protest. Ginger tells how she, broke and stranded, met O'Hearn and his friend, Marine Private First Class Davy White (Chuck Connors), of the 4th Marines in Shanghai two weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor. With war looming, the 4th Marines are ordered out of China. White slips away to propose marriage so that Ginger can be evacuated from China (at government expense) as his wife. O'Hearn tracks him down at the nightclub where Ginger works. When the club's manager objects to Ginger quitting, a brawl breaks out. The trio escape aboard a small motor boat. When the two men start fighting, Ginger tries to help White and accidentally disables the boat. They drift out to sea and are picked up by a passing junk. Once again, the Marines quarrel over White's future. This time, they accidentally set the sail on fire. They have to chop down the mast in order to save the ship. As a result, they are put ashore on the Vichy French island of Namou. To avoid being jailed, the Marines persuade pro-Axis Governor Pierre Marchand (Leon Askin) that they are deserters. They are quartered in a hotel/brothel run by Lillie Duval and her three \\"nieces\\". O'Hearn is delighted to make their acquaintance, to Ginger's annoyance. When a supposedly Dutch yacht calls at the island, O'Hearn tries to book passage, but the captain, Van Dorck (Rudolph Anders), refuses to take the risk. O'Hearn discovers that Van Dorck is actually a Nazi setting up radar stations on the islands around Guadalcanal, and plots to seize the ship with the help of expatriates like ex-U.S. Navy sailor \\"Jimmylegs\\" Donovan (Arthur Shields) and fugitive bank embezzler Smith, and Free French liberated from the prison. White refuses to join and says he is deserting and intends to remain on the island with Ginger. This causes Ginger to have second thoughts about their relationship. O'Hearn forces White on board the yacht at gunpoint. Back in the courtroom, O'Hearn breaks his silence in order to exonerate White. When Van Dorck and a search party find him, O'Hearn manages to kill them all. He and his men then overthrow the governor and load the island's armory on the ship, intending to join the fighting at Guadalcanal. Ginger slips aboard as a patriotic stowaway. They stumble upon a group of Japanese landing craft escorted by a destroyer. O'Hearn engages the Japanese in a fierce battle. When the destroyer tries to ram the yacht, White jumps aboard and climbs its smokestack. He throws in explosives, blowing up the destroyer at the cost of his own life. Only O'Hearn and Ginger survive; the rest of the crew die heroically. The court martial exonerates O'Hearn and recommends White for a posthumous Medal of Honor. O'Hearn and Ginger then admit they love each other. Cast *Burt Lancaster as Master Gunnery Sgt.

The current building dates from the expansion of the town around 1490, although it does contain some fabric from the 13th century. The minster church has a highly decorated tower which, at high, was described by Nickolaus Pevsner as one of the finest towers in the county. The tower was built around 1508. It contains a peal of six bells, and a clock built in Bridgwater in 1807. On the stonework are hunky punks in the shape of animals. The interior has a minstrel gallery from 1623, a carved wooden pulpit from the 15th century, and a brass chandelier which was added in 1984.

Bass attract wealthy land buyers to the southern California desert town. Bass and partner Bernard \\"Bud\\" Westlund owned Apple Valley Ranchos Land Development Co.http://archive.vvdailypress.com/2005/11187535765800.html The inn, which opened on Thanksgiving Day 1948, is a landmark in the community and a prominent feature in the history of Apple Valley. The inn was a popular vacation destination for Hollywood celebrities during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Frequent visitors included notable icons Bob Hope, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne and Richard Nixon in its heyday. Entertainment for guests included such performers as cowgirl celebrity and famous trick roper, Texas Rose Bascom. Jack Rogers, famed Country Western Singer, guitarist, and prolific composer, was frequently performing at the Inn during the sixties. He was a close friend and compatriot of “Newt” (the owner), Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Bob Hope, etc. Richard Nixon took a liking to Jack and his music and would go into the bar at night and each night request Jack play and sing “El Paso” which of course he accommodated. The inn originally allowed only white Christians as patrons. Apple Valley Ranchos Land established racial policies in its covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs;) dated Feb 14, 1946.http://archive.vvdailypress.com/2005/113577588216566.html The restrictions were increasingly relaxed throughout the 1950s as GI Bill money was used to purchase property. In 1954, screenwriter and producer Roger Corman set part of his movie Highway Dragnet at the inn with extensive shots of the lobby, pool and exterior scenes. In 1956, director Douglas Sirk and producer Ross Hunter utilized the same features as the 'Palm Valley Inn' in the film There's Always Tomorrow. In 1965, movie stars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and their family became residents of Apple Valley. Roy Rogers leased the inn and restaurant, which was then renamed Roy Rogers' Apple Valley Inn. The Outdoor Steak Fry and the Roy Rogers' Riding Stables, with its haywagon rides and horseback riding, were two popular enterprises attached to the inn. Mel Marion and then Billy Bascom managed the stables. Cowboy artist Earl Bascom and his artist son John worked there from time to time. Roy Rogers' personal horse, Trigger Junior, was frequently boarded at the riding stables.http://archive.vvdailypress.com/2004/108229499549784.html After many successful years, the inn closed to the public in 1987. It was purchased by the Lakritz Partnership in November 2003 and restored.

The first events were run in 1986 and the rules system was written and published by John Naylor and Steve Bell in 1986, by which point the national branch structure had already been established. The Society is democratic in nature and has multiple branches around the country. Most branches contain 15–20 members who play at least once a month, though some have as many as thirty. Members can travel between branches allowing them to play in various areas and interact in different plotlines. There are also yearly gatherings which involve multiple branches simultaneously, the largest of which is the Summerfest.  Format  At present there are twenty FnH branches across the UK (there was a Spanish branch operating at Barcelona from November 2017 to November 2018)http://huestesdearcana.blogspot.com/2018/11/fools-heroes-auge-y-caida- del-primer.html. Each branch elects a volunteer to act as Liaison Officer (LO) who is responsible for the administration of the branch. The LO also represents the branch's opinions on rules issues and various other topics during national meetings. Each branch also has referees who are responsible for running adventures. Most branches run sessions at least once a month, some as frequently as once a week. Most sessions consist of two adventures over a single day, members will play one game as their character and act as \\"monsters\\" in the other game. The advantage of this play style is that, unlike systems where dedicated crew teams must be employed, Fools and Heroes sessions have relatively low operating costs. Other than an annual society membership fee to cover administration costs there is typically no charge to attend these sessions. Every branch has its own plot, controlled by a team of referees. There is also a \\"national\\" plotline that all branches can take part in, this is controlled by volunteers elected from the society in general. Fools and Heroes main event is Summerfest, which runs the weekend of the bank holiday in August, and was the first LARP to break the 1000-attendee mark in the early 1990s. It is a four-day event with on site camping and generally allows players to finish a national plot line that has been running over the previous 12 months. Once again because of the format of missions the operating costs of these fests are lower than usual: even large Fools and Heroes events such as this one cost relatively little to attend.  Combat  FnH uses foam and latex weapons designed for use in live role play to ensure players' safety. As an additional precaution players are asked not to aim for the head and to pull their blows. The combat system is referred to as location based; to reduce bookkeeping to a minimum during battles all weapons deal a single point of damage. To determine the effects of this the body is separated into locations, two arms, two legs, torso, and head. Each location on a standard human has one hit point and if damaged must be healed before being able to be used again. Wounds to the head or body are known as lethal wounds, which cause unconsciousness and lead to death if untreated.  System  A player is allowed one character, a player character or PC. A PC is usually a member of a professional guild or a church following one of several gods. Their abilities depend on their position within their guild or church, which advances automatically after the character has played missions during a specific number of months. Players are also allowed to play special characters, those that do not fit into the standard rules set, which must be vetted by the society before starting play.  Game Setting  FnH is a medieval fantasy game, drawing inspiration from Warhammer Fantasy, Dungeons & Dragons, The Lord of the Rings and various other fictional and historical sources. The world itself is based on our own but countries and cities have different names, for example the equivalent of England is called \\"Ithron\\", Lancashire is called \\"Lanshore\\" and Newcastle is called \\"Newcroft\\". A fictional country named \\"Axir\\" exists, it is the home of the Axirian Empire, based strongly on the Roman Empire and with a similarly strong influence over the FnH world.  Races  Members may play characters from any of the standard fantasy races, provided they are willing and able to physically represent (\\"physrep\\") this appropriately. Nonhuman races possess varying natural abilities, and conversely suffer varying amounts of discrimination. An example of this is that certain professional guilds may disallow non-human members. Additional unique characters such as goblins, half-orcs and fey are permissible, though such variants must be approved by senior referees.  Classes  Fools and Heroes has three different concepts which are analogous to character classes in other games. Most characters will be members of at least one of the eight guilds. Guilds are most similar to character classes in other games; advancement within the guilds allows PCs access to different skills. The Guild of Scouts allows the finding of traps and tracking footprints. They usually wear leather armour. The Guild of Mercenaries are the front line of a battle, protecting their allies and usually suited with metal armour. The Guild of Alchemists spend their time away from adventures (known as downtime) brewing potions for use in the field. Some typical potions include those used to heal a wound instantly, to protect yourself from a single blow, or even become invisible for a short time. The Guild of Blacksmiths, much like Alchemists, use their downtime to make armour and weapons for adventurers, but they can also repair armour out in the field, making them very useful in a tough fight. The Guild of Physicians are the medicinal healers of the FnH world. Using their different drugs, they can heal wounds, stitch up cuts, and even reattach a severed limb. Physicians are worth their weight in gold on any party. The Law Guild ensures that the laws of the King, Robert Blackstone, are followed at all times. Guards, who are found in cities, and Foresters, who are usually in the wilds, can issue arrest warrants, check adventurers for their permits, and also declare people Outlawed. Secondly, there are seven Churches of the Gods of the light which PC's may join. PC's may choose the level to which they devote themselves to their God. They may be lay worshippers, known as Kindred, join the martial arm of the church known as the Devoted, or join the Priesthood itself. Each level of worship carries its own set of responsibilities and benefits. The Gods are as follows: Vleybor - Goddess of Life, Fertility and Healing. Kharach - God of Death, Mercy and Patience. Longstor - God of Nature and the Eternal Cycle. Sidhe - God of Truth, Justice and Fairness. Father to the other Gods. Tralda - Goddess of Luck, Fate and the Downtrodden. Rolbor - God of Knowledge, Prosperity and Wealth. Crowa - Goddess of Battle and Protection. Thirdly, there are four Knightly Orders of Ithron, all of which serve the church of Sidhe, the god of justice, to a greater or lesser degree.

Its existence was kept secret for the first two years of its use. It was constructed to hold the fourteen \\"high- value detainees\\" who had been held by the CIA, and were transferred to military custody on September 6, 2006. The detainees held in this camp don hoods when transferred from the camp to other locations for their military commission or other purposes. Some of the detainees, who faced charges before the Guantanamo military commissions, had attorneys who were initially told that they could not interview their clients. The attorneys were told it would be a breach of the camp's security for them to know the camp's location. When attorneys Suzanne Lachelier and Richard Federico offered to wear the same hoods the detainees wore to visit the camp, they were eventually allowed to visit the camp without wearing blindfolds. They were transported to the camp in the same windowless van as the detainees, so they did not know the camp's location. A 2013 budget request from the United States Southern Command for new prison construction at the base was presumed by reports to be for the replacement of Camp 7, though specifics of existing facilities were not discussed. According to an article by Carol Rosenberg, published in The New York Times, on September 17, 2019, Camp Seven had at least two recreation yards. At a preliminary hearing held that day prosecutors read a transcript of a conversation Ammar al Baluchi had with another captive, conducted by yelling over the wall of his recreation yard to the nearby recreation yard of the other man. It had not been known, until the release of this transcript, that the recreation yards contained hidden listening devices.

Kadir was a case decided in the High Court of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The case was brought by Menteri Besar of Perak state, Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin, against Zambry Abdul Kadir, who acted as Menteri Besar after three members of the state legislative assembly defected from Nizar's Pakatan Rakyat and threw their support behind Zambry's Barisan Nasional coalition. The subsequent confusion and controversy regarding the state government resulted in the 2009 Perak constitutional crisis. In his judgment handed down on 11 May 2009, Justice Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim ruled that Nizar was and had always been the rightful Menteri Besar, and ordered Zambry to immediately cease acting as Menteri Besar. The Court of Appeal granted a stay of execution of the High Court's order the following day, further confusing the situation. On 22 May 2009, the appellate court allowed an appeal by Barisan Nasional's Zambry Abd Kadir to reverse the Kuala Lumpur High Court decision that declared Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin as the rightful menteri besar of Perak. On 9 February 2010, five-member panel of Federal Court ruled unanimously Zambry Abdul Kadir is the valid Menteri Besar of Perak. The federal court bench found that Court of Appeal was justified in reversing the High Court decision which had earlier declared Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin as the rightful Perak menteri besar. Background Three members of the Perak state assembly who had previously supported the Pakatan Rakyat state government announced they were becoming political independents in February 2009, and that they would support the Barisan Nasional on matters of confidence and supply. Nizar asked Sultan Azlan Shah of Perak to dissolve the state assembly and call for new elections to resolve the political impasse. However, the Sultan rejected Nizar's request, ordered him to resign as Menteri Besar, and swore in Zambry as the new Menteri Besar. Nizar then filed suit against Zambry in the Kuala Lumpur High Court. Case history The first judge to hear the case was Judicial Commissioner Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof. However, on 25 February 2009, he recused himself, and was replaced by Justice Lau Bee Lan. On 6 March 2009, Lau submitted four questions of law to be resolved by the Federal Court. However, the Federal Court held that it did not have jurisdiction over a question of law regarding the Perak state constitution. Lau was then replaced by Justice Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim on 1 April 2009. Judgment Aziz's judgment held that in line with the case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan, former Chief Minister of Sarawak, the leader of a state government can only be toppled by a vote of no confidence in the state assembly. Aziz first dealt with the submissions of Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, an intervenor in the case; the Attorney-General had submitted that a state assembly can only be dissolved when the Menteri Besar loses the confidence of the legislature or at the expiration of the legislature's term, and that under Article 16(6) of the state constitution, Nizar had automatically resigned his position as Menteri Besar. Aziz rejected both submissions, finding that Article 36 provided for \\"unlimited circumstances for the menteri besar to request for dissolution from the Sultan,\\" and that although Article 16(6) suggests the Menteri Besar should resign, it cannot automatically compel him to do so. Perak State Legal Adviser Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid had submitted an affidavit supporting Zambry in the proceedings. However, Aziz found it unreliable, ruling that \\"It was [Kamal's] own admission that he was instructed by [Zambry's] counsel to affirm the affidavit. The word instructed is a very strong word. ... To me, he is not a neutral or impartial witness; his testimony was coloured by the instruction that he received.\\" Kamal had claimed that Nizar requested the dissolution of the state assembly under Article 16(6), which would mean Nizar had already lost the confidence of the state assembly. However, Nizar insisted his request was under Article 36(2), which allows the Menteri Besar to request dissolution for any reason. Aziz told the court that: Based on this, Aziz ruled that Nizar \\"is, and was, at all material times the chief minister of Perak.\\" Aziz's judgment granted the five declarations sought by Nizar: # That Nizar was the rightful Menteri Besar; # That there had been no dissolution of the Perak Assembly, no motion of no-confidence, and that Nizar had not resigned; # A writ of quo warranto against Zambry ordering him to show cause for the authority under which he acted as Menteri Besar; # That Zambry had no right to act as or occupy the office of Menteri Besar, and was not the Menteri Besar at any material time; # An injunction preventing Zambry from acting as Menteri Besar. Nizar had originally also sought punitive, aggravated and exemplary damages from Zambry, but withdrew the request a week before the judgment. Zambry's lawyer, Cecil Abraham, asked Aziz for a stay of the order after the judgment was handed down, but Aziz refused the request, asking Abraham to put it to him in writing. Reactions Nizar called the decision \\"a victory for the people of Malaysia. It also shows the judiciary can be depended on,\\" and stated his government would return to work the following day. Zambry said he and his colleagues would immediately vacate the state secretariat. At 4 in the afternoon of 11 May 2009, the day the judgment was handed down, the Federal Reserve Unit locked down the state secretariat. Later in the evening, Nizar's executive council met and agreed to suspend the state secretary and legal adviser for their conduct during the crisis, and announced they would \\"send a letter to the Sultan to seek an audience to ask for the dissolution of the assembly so the people can exercise their right to choose their government.\\" Nizar also insisted that as a result of the judgment in Nizar v. Zambry, 7 May 2009 sitting of the state assembly was unconstitutional and void because it had been called by Zambry, who was not in a position to act as Menteri Besar. Appeal On 12 May 2009, Zambry filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal. Sitting alone, judge Ramly Ali granted him a stay of execution on the High Court ruling. Lawyers and the press expressed surprise at Ramly's hearing the appeal alone, as there were three panels, each comprising three judges on the Court of Appeal, hearing cases the same day. Some also criticised the granting of a permanent, as opposed to temporary, stay. Former Court of Appeal judge N.H. Chan was particularly critical of Ramly's refusal to release his grounds of judgment, stating that the stay, along with the Federal Court's handling of the constitutional crisis, had \\"brought discredit to the judiciary.\\" Because of the stay, it was then unclear who is the Menteri Besar. Zambry has refused to address the question, while Nizar's camp asserts that the stay does not overrule the High Court judgment, and as such Nizar remains Menteri Besar. The Malaysian Bar Council's interpretation of the stay is that Zambry now acts as a caretaker Menteri Besar. The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court decision and declared Zambry the rightful Menteri Besar. The Case went further up to the Federal Court with Nizar appealing the verdict of the Court of Appeal. Ultimately, Nizar lost the legal proceedings when, in February 2010, the Federal Court ruled Zambry to be the lawful Menteri Besar.

He was part of the initial wave of artistic activity following the Mexican Revolution. However, his stay in Europe from 1927 to 1932 moved him into more European and more abstract work, especially sculpture. While he had a number of exhibitions in Mexico during his life including a retrospective at the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1965, he did not have the kind of success that many of his contemporaries did as he did not follow the then dominant themes or styles of Mexican muralism movement. His work was considered to be avant-garde and is considered to be the first Mexican abstract artist, creating masks and sculptures of wood, wire, plastic, sheet metal, ceramic, electrical wire and other materials, traditional and non- traditional. Life Germán Cueto was born Germán Gutiérrez Cueto y Vidal on February 8, 1893 in Mexico City to Javier Gutiérrez Cueto and Paz Vidal. His father was from an intellectual and socially influential family from Cantabria, Spain, related to politician Matilde de la Torre and María Blanchard . He was studying chemistry when the Mexican Revolution broke out, interrupting his studies as he fled to Spain to escape the fighting. At this time he met sculptor Fidencio Nava, which convinced him to change careers to art. When he returned to Mexico in 1918, he entered the Academy of San Carlos. However, he did not like its formalism and left shortly thereafter. He later studied in Paris. In 1923, he was a cofounder of the Stridentism movement in Mexico, along with Manuel Maples Arce, Germán List Arzubide, Salvador Gallardo, Silvestre Revueltas, Jean Charlot, Edward Weston and Tina Modotti. The goal of this movement was to reshape literature and art entirely, but fading by the end of the decade. From 1927 to 1932, he lived in Paris, traveling to the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. Here he created a circle of contacts and friends in the European vanguard often through María Blanchard. These included Julio González, Otto van Rees (artist), Angelina Beloff, Adam Fischer, Joaquín Torres García, Jacques Lipchitz and Constantin Brâncuși. He became a member of the Cercle et Carré where he became associated with Piet Mondrian, Jean Arp, Wassily Kandinsky and Georges Vantongerloo. After the death of María Blanchard in 1932, he decided to return to Mexico with his family, inviting Angelina Beloff, Diego Rivera’s abandoned first wife, to accompany them. In Mexico, he identified politically and socially with the dominant Mexican school of painting, but his aesthetics were more European due to his stay in Paris. He did not like the exclusiveness of the art scene in Mexico and for this reason tended to stay apart from his Mexican contemporaries. Cueto’s first wife was Lola Cueto whom he married in 1919 in Europe. The union produced two daughters named Ana Maria and Mireya. Mireya (b. 1922) became a well-known puppeteer, writer and playwright, winning the Bellas Artes Medal for her life’s work. Mireya began her career helping her parents. Cueto had another son later, named Javier Cueto. His second wife was María Galán and his widow was Ester Echeverría. Germán Cueto died on February 14, 1975 at age 83 from heart failure. Career Cueto worked in a number of disciplines but is best known for mask making, especially related to theatre and abstract sculpture. He began his career in 1922 as an assistant to sculptor Ignacio Asúnsolo, who work working on renovations to the Secretaría de Educación Pública building . Cueto was a member of the Stridentism movement in the 1920s, when he began to make masks with cardboard and other materials. In 1924 he had an exhibition of these masks at the “El Café de Nadie” affiliated with the Stridentism movement, most based on friends including one dedicated to Leopoldo Méndez . He continued to make masks for theatrical productions and exhibition, with the number of masks made over his lifetime estimated at over one thousand. Although Cueto was part of the initial wave of artistic activity spurred by the Secretaría de Educación Pública under José Vasconcelos, the movement limited much of artistic production, especially sculpture to themes related to praising the nation, liberty and work. Cueto's time in Europe in the late 1920s and early 1930s pushed him into a different direction. While considered to be in Mexico's vanguard, he was frequently frustrated by his inability to sell works after his return to Mexico. He was frequently excluded from public projects as his works did not relate to Mexican heroes or Mexican folkloric themes. Most of his work would not be appreciated until late in his career and after his death, as a pioneer of abstract and modern art in Mexico and Latin America. Although still relatively unknown in Mexico, his work is more valued by collectors, especially small bronze pieces. While never having the success that many of his contemporaries did, Cueto did have a number of exhibitions during his lifetime. His first was of masks in 1924 at the “El Café de Nadie” in Mexico City. Living in Paris, he exhibited with the Cercle et le Carré (Circle and Square) group, of which he was a member, as well as at the Renaissance Gallery in Paris (1928), the Quatre Gallery in Paris (1929), the 23 Gallery in Paris (1930), the Galeries Dalmau in Spain (1930) and at a collective exhibition in Switzerland. After returning to Mexico, he had some exhibitions such as the Galería de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City (1932), the UNAM Gallery (1933), a major individual exhibition at the Galería de Arte Mexicano in 1944, Mont-Oredain Gallery in Mexico City (1948), Glardecor Gallery in Mexico City (1951), the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana (1954), Excélsior Gallery and Proteo Gallery in Mexico City (1955) and the Instituto Francés de América Latina in 1960. He had one major individual exhibition outside of Mexico at the Suenks-Franska Konstgalleriet in Sweden in 1954. Despite his reputation for being avant-garde, his work was not recognized or shown at the prestigious Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City until 1965, when the institution dedicated a “very deserved” retrospective of his work. It has a larger exhibition of this type in 1981 after the artist's death. Other exhibitions of his work after his death include the Futurismo & futurism exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice (1986), Centro Cultural Santo Domingo in Oaxaca (2000), the Federico Silva Museum in San Luis Potosí (2005), Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (2005), the Carrillo Gil Museum in Mexico City (2006) and the Museo de Arte in Querétaro (2007). His canvas works can be found primarily in museum in Mexico and Europe with a notable collection held by the Blaisten Collection in Mexico City. His sculptures, including monumental works can be found in institutions in Mexico and Europe such as the Sala Manuel M. Ponce at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and the Museo de Arte Moderno. On permanent display at the Museo de Arte Moderno is the sculpture Tehuana, which consists of sheet metal about 110 cm high. He did ceramics work for the Arabia Workshop in Helsinki and a porcelain piece for the Royal Copenhagen in Denmark . One major monumental work is an iron piece painted in enamel, for the Gustavsberg porcelain plant in Sweden sponsored by the Swedish-Mexican Society in 1954. In Mexico, he created the monumental piece called El Corredor (The Runner) for the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, places in front of the stadium at the Ciudad Universitaria . Another notable area for Cueto was theatre and education. After he returned to Mexico from Europe, Carlos Chávez employed him to develop characters for an educational puppet theatre. From 1924 to 1926 he taught art at the Artes y Oficio Gabriela Mistral and at the Normal para Maestros. He also went to teach in Hidalgo as part of a cultural mission organized by Rafael Ramírez Heredia . In 1948 he directed the Dance Institute at the Palacio de Bellas Artes for a time, creating masks for various performances. From 1956 to 1959 he was an art professor at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\". In 1960 he became a teacher at the Escuela de Artesanias of the Ciudadela, teaching work with enamel. Recognitions include honorable mention at the Bienal Nacional de Escultura in 1963 and 1964. He was a founding member of the Academia de Artes and a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana . Artistry Cueto created oils, watercolors, glass, ceramics, enamels, collages, murals, ink drawings, sculpture and even some literature. He was best known for masks and sculptures using various materials such as wire, clay, stone, iron, wood and more. Cueto's early artistic influence from Stridentism, an artistic and intellectual movement in Mexico in the 1920s of which he was a member. Like many other Strident artists, Cueto rejected traditional values and religious conventions. This usually translated into pieces related to a vision of a future utopia. Later influences included Cubism, Constructivism, Art Deco and later a more primitive look. However, most of this is linked to his time (1927-1932) in Europe, where he was influenced directly by Picasso, Brâncuși, Gargollo and Juan Gris . His artistic vision remained tied to Europe and the abstract art movement taking shape there, which was still very novel for Mexico. This made him the most vanguard sculpture of the first half of the 20th century in Mexico as well as the country's first abstract artist. It also meant that his work as more influential in Europe than in Mexico. One major aspect of his sculptural work is the use of new and unusual materials along with more traditional ones. He created sculptures of bronze, wood, wire, sheet metal, ceramics, enamel on metal, concrete, electrical cable, plastic and more. His aesthetic followed much of Umberto Boccioni’s 1912 Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture when said that sculpture should use and combine whatever materials needed to realize a piece. It also emphasized the abstract over the figurative. Much of his experimentation was based on his knowledge of chemistry from his early student days and made him one of the most experimental sculptors in 20th century Mexico. Examples include concrete, electrical cable and wire pieces such as Estela II, Máscara (1948) and El Nahual. The sculpture Napoleón is done in limestone; Diálogo is done in multicolored wood. Another important endeavor for Cueto was the creation of masks, the concept of which also figures in his sculpture and other work. He made masks of papier-mâché, cartonería, ceramic, plaster, wood, metal and wire. Many of these masks were made for use in theatre, with him often returning to creating fantastical faces with innovative designs.

Views on Homosexuality Vonholdt's views on homosexuality are controversial. They are based upon both theological and psychological arguments. = Theology = From a biblical standpoint, she, together with most Christians worldwide, holds homosexual practise (praktizierte Homosexualität) to be sinful.Christl Ruth Vonholdt: Eine Frage des Menschenbildes – Warum Homosexualität Sünde ist. In: Zeitzeichen 6 (2005), p. 33-34.Christl Ruth Vonholdt, Andreas Laun, Norbert Geis et al. (Hrsg.): Homo-Ehe. Nein zum Ja-Wort aus christlicher Sicht. Bernardus-Verlag Langwaden, Grevenbroich 2001, . She states that, from a theological perspective, it is only the unity of man and woman which is able to represent a complete human being and marriage is an icon of God, a reflection of God's image. Sexuality is the creative energy which enables us reach out beyond ourselves to the opposite sex. Homosexual intercourse has been called sin by Jews and Christians because it fails to be an icon of God. She believes the argument, that homosexuality is natural and therefore, not to be considered sin, has its roots in Gnosticism. In regards to the religious viewpoint, Vonholdt has expressed her belief that God has created everyone with sexuality. It is the duty of man to then be oriented in the correct manner, which is toward the opposite sex.\\"Umgang mit homosexuellen Priestern scheint nicht einfach\\", Mitteldeutsche Zeitung, October 27, 2005. = Psychology = From a psychological standpoint, she regards homosexuality to be a symptom for a deeper underlying dysfunction.Verena Ahne; Bert Ehgartner; Thomas Hanifle: Debatte: Ist Homosexualität angeboren oder Produkt besonderer Lebensumstände?, profil.at, November 19, 2005.

Hildreth was the heavy favorite to win, however Clauson was able to narrowly defeat him, retaining the Blaine House for the Democrats. The election was also the last time that Maine would hold its election in September. Traditionally, Maine had held its elections two months before the rest of the nation, which had help give birth to the phrase \\"As Maine goes, so goes the nation\\" and its status as a bellwether state.

Headed by real estate developer William A. Engeman, who owned the Brighton Beach Hotel, the one-mile race track was located in back of the hotel and bounded by Ocean Parkway on the west, Neptune Avenue on the north, Coney Island Avenue on the east, and Brighton Beach Avenue on the south. An instant success, the race track drew wealthy patrons from New York City, and harness racing was introduced there in 1901. Among its most important Thoroughbred horse racing events were the Brighton Derby for three-year-olds and the Brighton Handicap that was open to older horses. On July 17, 1900, James R. Keene's horse Voter set a new World Record of 1:38.00 for a mile on dirt at the Brighton Beach Race Course. The track prospered until 1908 when the New York Legislature passed the Hart–Agnew Law banning gambling in New York State. Motor racing events were held at the facility in an attempt to keep the track from closing but even after horse racing returned to New York it was too late to save the track. At the time it ceased horse racing operations, the Brighton Beach Race Course was the oldest horse track in steady use in the New York City area. The racetrack was then used for automobile racing for a time and after other measures failed to make it viable, the facility was finally torn down and by the 1920s replaced by residential housing.

Some have been intended to be permanent, and others seasonal; most have been staged at existing tourist locations. Former permanent exhibitionsDoctor Who Experience= An exhibition titled Doctor Who Experience, complete with a new interactive Doctor Who episode with the Eleventh Doctor, opened at London Olympia on 20 February 2011 after a number of test days and preview visits. It closed on 22 February 2012. Construction of the Doctor Who Experience The exhibition moved to Cardiff, opening on 20 July 2012. The new exhibition was housed in an unusual 3000 square metre building in Porth Teigr designed by theme-park company Sarner Ltd. Due to the temporary nature of the exhibition, with a 5-year lease on the site, the building was constructed like a large tent, with a cover stretched over curved steel beams. Exhibitions in the Doctor Who Experience The exhibition began with a short film and a walk-through adventure inside the Eleventh Doctor's first TARDIS interior and in various locations. Later, after the replacement of Matt Smith visitors were instead led through the experience by a guide and the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) Following the adventure portion guests were free to roam two floors of exhibitions including original costumes from ten of the twelve Doctors (the first two being replicas as the originals were lost). Alien prosthetics, Daleks and Cybermen over history, Sonic devices, and the TARDIS interiors belonging to the First Doctor, Fourth Doctor, Fifth Doctor, and the Ninth Doctor and Tenth Doctor. Many other show memorabilia and artefacts were also on display, including costumes from the companions since 2005 including: Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, Captain Jack Harkness, Amy Pond and Rory Williams. Each year since opening, costumes and props used from new series were been showcased. In 2013, props, such as Porridge's costume, the deactivated chess-playing Cyberman (from \\"Nightmare in Silver\\") the costumes of the Eleventh Doctor and Clara Oswald, along with the giant snow globe from the Christmas episode entitled \\"The Snowmen\\", were also added to the collection. In late 2014 props and costumes from \\"Last Christmas\\" were added. Museum patrons could also take pictures in front of a green screen, with multiple backgrounds to choose from including Totter's Lane (from the Doctor's first adventure) and inside the time vortex, as well as several props such as various Sonic Screwdrivers and articles of clothing symbolic to several Doctors (e.g. Matt Smith's fez). Cardiff Bay is home to the BBC Roath Lock production studios, as well as locations from the Torchwood series. The experience closed its doors on 9 September 2017, due to, what was originally blamed on the lease running out, the ticket sales over a five-year period not covering a loan from the Cardiff Council and, by extension, the Welsh government. BBC Worldwide have said they are \\"not sure yet\\" if it is going to reopen elsewhere. =Longleat= The first permanent exhibition was set up at the stately home of Longleat, Wiltshire in 1973, and ran until 2003. The site has also hosted annual Doctor Who conventions, usually in August. The twentieth anniversary convention was titled \\"Twenty Years of a Time Lord\\" and was held in April 1983. It featured appearances from Jon Pertwee (and the vintage car Bessie), Peter Davison, K9; props included the TARDIS, Daleks, and the set of The Five Doctors feature- length special. About 40,000 fans turned up, many more than expected. In 2003, the annual \\"Doctor Who Day\\", to mark the 40th anniversary of the programme, featured an attempt to gather the largest number of Daleks ever assembled. Colin Baker, Sophie Aldred and John Leeson attended. =Blackpool= The original exhibition on the Golden Mile, Blackpool, Lancashire, operated between 1974 and 1985. It reopened in 2004 to coincide with the relaunch of the programme. The Blackpool Doctor Who Museum finally closed on 8 November 2009, the large collection of props, monsters and costumes (including the Doctors' trademark car, Bessie, and classic monsters such as Tractators, Ice Warriors and Yeti) being distributed to other exhibitions around the country. =Llangollen= Road sign featuring a Dalek pointing to the Dr Who Experience The \\"Dapol Dr Who Experience\\" opened in 1994 and was sited in Llangollen, Denbighshire, Wales, under the auspices of the company that made Doctor Who merchandise until 2002. It featured many costumes and props, some dating back to the 1960s. It closed in 2003. =Cardiff= Entrance to the Doctor Who Exhibition The Doctor Who Exhibition Cardiff was the only semi-permanent exhibition in the UK. Situated in the Red Dragon Centre, Cardiff Bay, the museum opened December 2005, in the city where the series is currently recorded and produced. It was closed on 27 March 2011 before in July 2012 the above-mentioned Doctor Who Experience opened on the other side of the city. Props on display included an Ood Elder from \\"The End of Time\\", a fly-headed Tritovore and Lady Christina De Souza's costume from \\"Planet of the Dead\\", plus the 'Flood' monster and Maggie and Tarak Ital costumes from \\"The Waters of Mars\\". There was also a special display from the team behind the show's monsters, Millennium FX, showing the production process behind creating an Ood. Costumes displayed included those worn by the characters Martha Jones, Captain Jack Harkness, Donna Noble and the Doctor. The Cardiff Exhibition had a complete refurbishment in October 2008. The Doctor Who Up Close Shop was stocked with items such as giant inflatable Daleks, sonic screwdrivers and talking bottle openers.

A lifelong militant, he became a member of the French Communist Party in 1940, and remained loyal to the party. Life Born in Hergnies, Nord, a small town in the coal-mining region of northern France, Stil was educated at the University of Lille, earning a degree in philosophy. He taught at the University from 1941 to 1944. Having joined the Communist Party in 1940, he then held a series of increasingly senior editorial positions with communist newspapers. He was secretary-general of Liberté until 1949, then editor-in-chief of Ce Soir. He served as editor of the party's main newspaper, L'Humanité, until 1956, continuing to contribute thereafter, and from 1950 to 1970 he was a member of the French Communist Party's central committee. Beginning in 1949, he published some fifty volumes, comprising mainly socialist realist novels, but also short stories and a volume of verse. Supported by Louis Aragon, he won the Stalin Prize for his trilogy The First Clash (1951–1953). He won the Grand Prix du Roman Populaire, was awarded the Legion d'Honneur, and in 1977 was elected one of the ten members of the Academie Goncourt.James Kirkup, \\"André Stil: Obituary\\" The Independent September 9, 2004, recovered May 11, 2009 In 1956 he published a report from the Hungarian Revolution, describing an apparent mass murder of Hungarian communists. However Peter Fryer, a British journalist and Marxist who, unlike Stil was present during the Revolution and Soviet crack-down, questioned Stil's account arguing that 'Stil [was] obviously performing the disagreeable task of a propagandist making the most of a small number of atrocities.' Indeed, Fryer refuted Stil's account pointing out that those killed were in fact members of the hated AVH secret police. Works His first novel, The Word \`Coalminer', Comrade (1949) launched his enduring themes of working class life and militant communist politics. This was followed by a short story collection, The Seine has Taken to the Sea (1950) and his prize-winning trilogy The First Clash (1951–1953). This tells the story of the resistance of dock workers to the arrival of an American arms ship and contains detailed accounts of domestic working-class life. Anti-Americanism and the French-Algerian problem were important themes in his work through the 1950s.John Ernest Flower, Literature and the Left in France Routledge, 1985, 152-153 He returned to his coal-mining background repeatedly in his fiction; one of his last novels was Coal Dust on the Snow (1996). In addition to his prolific fiction, he wrote a critical work, Towards Socialist Realism, and an autobiography, A Life Spent Writing. He also wrote scripts for television. =List of works= * Au mot amour * Beau comme un homme * Bélesta * Conte du premier œuf * De eerste stoot 3 dedlen * Dieu est un enfant * Fleurs par erreur * Gazelle * La neige fumée * La question du bonneur est posée 1- le blé égyptien * L'ami dans le miroir * Le Médecin de charme * L'autre monde, etc. * L'Homme de cœur * L'homme fleur * Le foudroyage * Le médecin de charme * Le mot mineur camarades ... * Le Mouvement de la terre * Le roman de Constance * Le premier choc - au château d'eau * Les oiseaux migrateurs * Les Quartiers d'été * Malaguanyat * Maxime et Anne * Nous nous aimerons demain * Paris avec nous le premier choc * Pêche à la plume * Pierwski starcie 2 volume * Pignon sur ciel * Quand Robespierre et Danton inventaient la France * Qui ? * Romansonge * Soixante-quatre coquelicots * Une histoire pour chaque matin * Une vie à écrire References Category:1921 births Category:2004 deaths Category:People from Nord (French department) Category:20th-century French novelists Category:Stalin Prize winners Category:Officiers of the Légion d'honneur Category:French Communist Party members Category:French male novelists Category:Communist writers ","title":"André Stil"},{"id":"22766620","text":"Frank Lumley Playford (1855–1931) was a British rower who won the Wingfield Sculls five times and the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta in 1876.

Picquet, whose opposition faction represented 3.7% at the founding congress of the New Anticapitalist Party, disagreed with the majority's refusal to ally with the Communist-led Left Front for the European elections. As a result, Picquet's small movement integrated the Left Front and Picquet was the third candidate on the coalition's list in the Île-de-France constituency. Ideologically, the party sought to unite all democratic socialists opposed to neo-liberalism under a common front. The GU was part of the Left Front until 2014.

It was first built in 1915-1918 by Nakagawa Katsutaro, a master builder of Japanese-style temples, then renovated in 1929 by Hego Fuchino, a self-taught man who was the first person of Japanese ancestry to become a licensed architect in the Islands. The building underwent further changes in 1978, and was considerably augmented in 1992. However, its most distinctive features remain: the steep, hipped-gable roof (irimoya) with rounded-gable projection, both with elaborate carvings on the ends, and the glittering altar and interior furnishings from Japan that signify its ties to esoteric Shingon Buddhism. The temple was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 26 April 2002. History The round tomoe at the top of the entrance roof represents the cycle of life. It is also the traditional symbol of the Koyasan Shingon sect, though the temple has been independent of sectarian affiliations since 2004. The carved phoenix represents death and rebirth, and the carved dragons represent both power and good fortune. The obelisk at the front edge of the property commemorates the first Shingon pilgrimage to Japan by immigrants in Hawaii in 1929. The more recently added statue in front depicts Kōbō Daishi (Kūkai, 774-835 CE), the founder of Shingon. An oil painting of the Daishi by a member, Mrs. Helen Nakagawa Abe, of the local congregation also graces the altar inside the temple. The temple is congregational, and reflects the diversity of Hawaii in its membership. In 2009, the temple added a worship service in English, and planned on a slow transition to primarily English services. The Shingon Shu Hawaii temple commissioned the creation of a ceiling panel (tenjo-e) that depicts the Taizokai mandala which measures . Done in original pigments mixed by Japanese artisans and suspended in animal fat, the pigments were applied to individually lacquered (urushi) panels, then placed by hand into a grid suspended from the ceiling. In 2007 the arrival of Fujin (Wind God) and Raijin (Thunder God) statues, completed the second phase of the temple's artistic additions. The statues which can be seen at the immediate entrance of the main hall were chosen to depict the Hawaiian prevailing trade winds with Fujin, and an appreciation for the power and force of nature in Raijin. Each stand over ten feet in height, and weigh over 2800 pounds a piece. Constructed of Japanese Cypress, they are the largest depictions of the Wind and Thunder Gods outside Japan.

It is also given to the name of the people who live in the city of Manchester. Throughout the 19th century and for most of the 20th century, speech in Manchester was considered part of the Lancashire dialect. Many of the dialect poets of the 19th century came from Manchester and the surrounding area. In the early 20th century, the Manchester Ballads featured Lancashire dialect extensively. As many of the traditional dialect features have died out in Manchester, it has been seen by some in recent years as a separate dialect. In Peter Trudgill's book The Dialects of England, it was classified as part of the \\"Northwest Midlands\\" dialect region. It is claimed that the Manc dialect of British English has subconsciously changed the way people from the other English-speaking UK regions talk through the British popular culture of television shows such as Coronation Street. Also, later rock bands such as Oasis, Joy Division, Happy Mondays and The Stone Roses had distinct Manchester accents.  Dialect  The speech of the city of Manchester has never been the subject of an in-depth study. The early dialectologist Alexander John Ellis included the city in his survey of English speech, and placed most of Greater Manchester (excluding the Bolton and Wigan areas) in his 21st dialect district, which also included north-west Derbyshire. In the 1982 textbook Accents of English, John C. Wells makes some comments on the Manchester dialect, which he describes as being \\"extremely similar\\" to the dialect of Leeds. His proposed criteria for distinguishing the two are that Mancunians avoid Ng-coalescence, so singer rhymes with finger and king, ring, sing, etc. all end with a hard sound, and also that Leeds residents employ \\"Yorkshire assimilation\\", by which voiced consonants change into voiceless consonants in words such as Bradford , subcommittee and frogspawn .  Geographical coverage  The Manchester accent is relatively localised, and is usually found in Greater Manchester including the cities of Salford and Manchester and also in adjoining parts of the boroughs of Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside and Trafford. It is also prominent in 'overspill' towns and estates such as Hattersley, Gamesley, Handforth and Birchwood. The dialect itself is more distinctive than many people realise. It is quite noticeably different from the accent spoken in adjacent towns such as Bolton, Oldham and Wigan despite them being within Greater Manchester. The Mancunian accent is less dialect heavy than neighbouring Lancashire and Cheshire accents, although words such as owt (meaning 'anything') and nowt (meaning 'nothing') remain part of the Mancunian vocabulary. Particularly strong examples of the accent can be heard spoken by Davy Jones of The Monkees who was born in Openshaw, Mark E. Smith (Salford- born, Prestwich-raised singer with The Fall), the actor John Henshaw (from Ancoats) and Liam and Noel Gallagher from Burnage band Oasis. The actor Caroline Aherne (raised in Wythenshawe) spoke with a softer, slower version of the accent. Stretford-raised Morrissey – like many Mancunians, from an Irish background – has a local accent with a noticeable lilt inherited from his parents. Salford-born Tony Wilson retained his Mancunian accent albeit somewhat modified by his upbringing in Marple and his Cambridge education. Salford poet John Cooper Clarke is another fine example of a working-class Mancunian accent as can be heard in his spoken-word recordings. Also from Salford is comedian Jason Manford, whose Manc accent adds to his comedic style. Other notable 'Manc' speakers include boxer Ricky Hatton (from Hattersley, Hyde) and the actor Bernard Hill (from Blackley). Dominic Monaghan speaks with a notable Manc accent, and his characters in both Lost and FlashForward have made note of it. Less well known outside of the area, and with pronounced local accents, are local broadcasters Eamonn O'Neal, Mike Sweeney and Jimmy Wagg. The TV broadcaster Terry Christian (from Old Trafford) has a particularly prominent voice. The Mancunian accent is prominent in the locally-set TV series Shameless, The Street and The Royle Family. The character Jack Regan in the 1970s police drama The Sweeney (played by Longsight-born actor John Thaw) is a Mancunian with an accent heavily modified by years of living in London. Another example of a Mancunian speaker is Karl Pilkington, a radio and TV personality. Manchester's most famous soap opera Coronation Street has, despite being based in the city (a fictionalised version of Salford), less pronounced Mancunian accents than other TV shows set in the area. Several of the show's cast members do speak with pronounced Mancunian accents in the series. They include Michelle Keegan (Tina), Helen Flanagan (Rosie Webster) and Simon Gregson (Steve McDonald). The West Sussex- raised British actress, Jane Leeves, portrayed the character of Daphne Moon, a Manchester emigrant to Seattle with a supposed Mancunian accent which was actually much closer to a broad Lancashire dialect, in the American sitcom Frasier. =Study of Stockport dialect= Linguist K. R. Lodge published several articles on the speech of Stockport (1966, 1973, 1978). In , a comparison of a teenager with an older resident, he noted the movement away from monophthongs , and in face, goat and price (still common in other areas of the North) towards diphthongs. He also noted an increase in T-glottalisation and a reduction in definite article reduction. Phonology The dialect is distinguishable from other Northern English dialects. A major feature of the Mancunian accent is the over-enunciation of vowel sounds when compared to the flattened sounds of neighbouring areas. This is also noticeable with words ending in such as tenner. Traditionally, the Manchester area was known for glottal reinforcement of the consonants , similar to modern speech in the north-east of England. Like all Northern accents, Mancunians have no distinction between the STRUT and FOOT vowels or the TRAP and BATH vowels. This means that but and put are rhymes, as are gas and glass (which is not the case in the south). The unstressed vowel system of Manchester i.e. the final vowels in words such as happY and lettER are often commented on by outsiders. Phonetically, both vowels are lowered and backed. This means that the final vowel in happY sounds more like the vowel in DRESS (rather than the vowel in KIT like many Northern accents, or the vowel in FLEECE like many Southern accents) and the final vowel in lettER is often perceived as being similar to the vowel in LOT (although this has been found to be a slight exaggeration of the true pronunciation). The GOAT and GOOSE vowels show socioeconomic variation in Manchester, but in different directions. A fronter GOAT vowel is positively correlated with higher social classes, whereas GOOSE is stable across all social classes except before /l/, where a fronter GOOSE is correlated with lower social classes. Another notable aspect of the phonology of Manchester English is \\"velar nasal plus\\" or the retention of [ɡ] after [ŋ] (where it has been lost in almost all other modern varieties of English), such that the words singer and finger rhyme for Manchester speakers, both having a medial [ŋɡ] cluster. Vocabulary Here are some of Mancunian's most notable dialectical words, phrases and sayings. These are not used by the entire population: * angin – nasty, disgusting * buzzing – extremely happy * dead – an emphasis marker (e.g., 'dead busy' and 'dead friendly'.) * the dibble – refers to the police * gaff – a residence, house or flat * ginnel – an alleyway, especially when passing beneath a building * madferit (Mad for it) – full of enthusiasm, a phrase that embodied the Madchester era * muppet – ignorant, foolish * safe – to be on good terms, also used to mean 'okay' and as a greeting * sayin(g) – contraction of 'what are you saying?', now used as a greeting, via sense of 'what are you up to?' * scran – food (also used in Liverpool and Glasgow and Newcastle) * scrote – refers to someone worthless or unpleasant; a low-life (Short for scrotum). * sorted – okay/dealt with (Sorted out) * sound – okay, trustworthy Irish influences include the pronunciation of the letter 'h' as (although this pronunciation is now widespread, being used by approximately 24% of British people born since 1982) and the plural of 'you' as youse/yous. Spoken Word performer and poet Argh Kid (David Scott) breaks down Mancunian vocabulary in his piece \\"Nanna Calls Me Cock\\".

Family Edward Sellon was born 6 Jan 1818 in Brighton, England (bap. 9 July 1818 in Paddington, England), the only child of Edward Sellon (1791–1822) and Laura Willats (b. 1794). Edward, Sr. was the son of William Marmaduke Sellon (1757–1824), a brewer and proprietor of several public-houses (pubs), and Henrietta Say (1761–1844). Laura was the daughter of Thomas Willats (1762–1852) and Laura Elizabeth Littlehales (1760–1825). After her husband's death, Laura married John Booty on 14 October 1828. Edward, Jr. married Sarah Ann Wilds (c. 1819–1866) on 29 February 1840 in Brighton, England. Sarah was the daughter of Amon Henry Wilds (1790–1857) and Sarah Pain (1791–1871). Edward and Sarah had four children, all born in Brighton: * Guillimina Constance Sellon (1842–1842) * Ernest Littlehales Sellon (1847–1926); college lecturer...died in Brentford, England * William Loftus Sellon (1851–1895); a painter...died in Edinburgh, Scotland * Marmaduke St Juste Sellon (1855–1925); a priest...died in Paris, France Life and writings Sellon joined the army at age 16 and served in India for ten years, eventually being promoted to captain. In 1844 he married a wife, but finding that she was not as rich as he had been led to believe before the marriage, left her to live in London with his mother at Bruton Street. Here, after two years, his wife rejoined him, but now Sellon was keeping a mistress in another part of town, and had seduced his fourteen-year-old parlour maid, a girl called Emma.Henry Spencer Ashbee (1969) Index of Forbidden Books London: Sphere; pp. 407-17 His wife's discovery of this latter affair led to fighting, and her leaving him, though Sellon was seemingly unrepentant. Hard times followed after the family fortune was lost and Sellon was constrained to work as a stagecoach driver on the Cambridge Mail for two years and afterwards as a fencing master. Later on, after numerous affairs, he was reconciled with his wife and went to live with her in a village in the New Forest, Hampshire for three years. After she had a child, though, he grew tired of her and returned to London where he resumed a life of debauchery. A final reconciliation with his wife was engineered by a rich relation of Sellon, of whom the latter had financial expectations. This was, however, terminated when his wife discovered him leading a group of schoolgirls into a local wood \\"for a game of hide and seek\\".Henry Spencer Ashbee (1969) Index of Forbidden Books London: Sphere; pp. 416 In his last years Sellon wrote erotica for the pornographic publisher William Dugdale. These included The New Epicurean (1865) and a memoir entitled The Ups and Downs of Life (1867) which featured his erotic escapades in India.H.

It was later modified into the Type 171 Jockey II, which had a more powerful engine and detail improvements. Only one was built; it was lost before its development was complete, but the knowledge gained enabled Vickers to produce the more refined Venom. Development In the late 1920s the idea of the interceptor fighter was forming. To deal with the faster and higher flying bombers, fighters had both to be fast at height and quick to get there. The Air Ministry was keen to determine the best aircraft configuration and sought, under Air Ministry specification F.20/27, manufacturers to build biplanes and both low- and high- wing monoplanes. Vickers were asked for a prototype low-wing fighter and this became (somewhat unofficially) called the \\"Jockey\\", or sometimes the Jockey I. The name covered Vickers Types 151 and 171; the Jockey II was an early name for the later Venom. Vickers Type 151 Jockey The Type 151 Jockey was a compact and rather angular, low cantilever wing monoplane, built using the Wibault- Vickers corrugated skinned all-metal method as used on the Vireo. The unstressed skin was riveted onto a largely duralumin structure, a few steel tubes forming highly stressed members. The parallel chord, square-tipped wing used the thick, high-lift RAF 34 cross-section that Vickers had employed on the Viastra. The tailplane was equally rectangular and the fin clipped. All control surfaces apart from the rudder were unbalanced. The pilot's open cockpit was at the highest part of the fuselage at mid-chord. The Bristol Mercury IIA nine-cylinder radial was initially mounted without a cowling. A single-axle undercarriage had legs attached to front and rear wing spars. The Jockey was taken to RAF Martlesham Heath for its first flight in April 1930 and subsequent testing. A rear fuselage vibration was at first thought to be aerodynamic but proved to be structural; it was cured after Barnes Wallis redesigned the internal bracing. The rudder was modified, its balance removed and a trim tab installed. Spats were added to the undercarriage and a Townend ring enclosed the engine. The same aircraft was renamed the Type 171 Jockey when the Mercury was replaced by a supercharged Bristol Jupiter VIIF. The intention to power the Jockey with a supercharged Mercury IVS2 was never realised, after the sole Jockey was lost in a flat spin on 5 July 1932, crashing at Woodbridge, Suffolk, the pilot bailing out at . The results of the tests had been sufficiently good to encourage Vickers to refine its design into the Vickers Venom.

Founded in 1915 in the tradition of English and American glee clubs, it is the oldest Glee Club at a Catholic University in the United States. HistoryFounding and development= Samuel Ward Perrott founded the Notre Dame Glee Club in 1915. Perrott had studied at Notre Dame (1912–1914, 1915–1916) as well as Harvard University (1914–1915). While at Harvard, Perrott joined the Harvard Glee Club under direction of Archibald Davison. According to the 1916 edition of Notre Dame's yearbook, the Dome, it was at Harvard that Perrott \\"got the idea of how a (glee) club should be run.\\" Perrott returned to Notre Dame again as a student in the fall of 1915 and held auditions for a Glee Club. At these first auditions, one hundred young men tried out for fifty places. Thus the Notre Dame Glee Club was born. The Glee Club first took the stage on December 11, 1915 in Washington Hall on the campus of the University of Notre Dame and performed to a receptive audience. The student magazine, The Scholastic, called the performance \\"a triumph\\" and the Dome observed, \\"Before this time there had been grave doubts expressed about the success of the club,\\" but with the first concert, the clouds of doubt were dispelled. Perrott began plans for a major concert tour. Although the major tour plans fell through, the Glee Club did perform its first tour concert in Indianapolis, IN on May 6, 1916. The Glee Club today For formal performances, the group members wear formal evening dress (White tie). On other occasions the group performs in matching blazer and necktie, matching polo shirts, or in street clothes. The club performs four annual campus concerts, one in Autumn, one at Christmas (three consecutive performances of the same program, the proceeds of which go to the South Bend Center for the Homeless and Food Bank), one in Spring, and one for commencement. All major concerts have been performed in the 950-seat Leighton Concert Hall in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC). Before the construction of the DPAC, the concerts took place in Washington Hall, which can seat 550 people. The group or portions of it perform other concerts over the course of the year. These include ND in Revue (Saturday mornings before each ND home football game), joint concerts with other campus and outside ensembles, events in and around the South Bend area, and certain University functions. The group has partnered with visiting artists; in recent years, these have included Ronan Tynan, Leon Fleisher, Dave Brubeck, Vince Gill, and the Kronos Quartet. The group also partners with the South Bend Symphony Orchestra; pieces they have performed together in recent years include Symphony No. 2 (Mahler), the 1812 Overture, and Alexander Nevsky. Every year the group sings at Mass in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. The Glee Club goes on two, week-long domestic tours every year, over the University's Fall and Spring Break weeks. They usually travel by bus, performing a full concert each night. The group also performs internationally.

This faction, known as Unir was a minority faction within the LCR and disappeared with the creation of the New Anticapitalist Party, the LCR's successor party. In 2009, at the creation of the New Anticapitalist Party, he founded the Unitarian Left with a part of Unir minority. The Unitarian Left joined the PCF-led Left Front. He was selected to be the third candidate on the Left Front's list in the Île-de- France constituency ahead of the 2009 European elections.

Scientists such as Ctesibius and Archimedes produced the first inventions involving hydraulic power (Oleson 1984). Specific technology The most prevalent hydraulic pump used in maritime situations in ancient Rome was the bilge pump, which functioned to siphon collected water out of a ship’s hull (Oleson 1984). The bilge pump was an improvement on the first hydraulic pumps used in antiquity: force pumps. Invented around the early 3rd century BCE, the most primitive design of a force pump consisted of a piston pushing water out of a tube, constructed by soldering individual bronze elements (Stein 246). Written accounts from Phil of Byzantium (late 3rd century BCE), Vitruvius (c. 25 BCE), and Hero of Alexandria (c. CE 50) confirm archaeological evidence for the original simple design, and both Hero and Vitruvius specify that the pump was typically made of bronze (Stein 2004). Somewhere along the way a new design arose that involved cutting apertures into an individual wood block and then rendering the block pressure-proof with tightly fitting plugs and plates (Stein 2004). Although cheaper and easier to manufacture, assemble, and repair, the wooden pumps manufactured from then on would most likely not have been durable enough for maritime use, which is why we usually find lead pipes associated with bilge pumps, bilge wells, and hydraulic devices of other function about ships. The amphora shipwreck discovered at Grado in Gorizia, Italy, which dates to around 200 CE, and contained what archaeologists hypothesized to be a ‘hydraulics’ system to change the water in live fish tanks, since other evidence indicates the ship’s involvement in the processed fish trade (Beltrame and Gaddi 2005). This hypothesis has been disputed, since the wooden box protecting a lead pipe along the longitudinal axis of the hull found on the wreck suggest the existence of a bilge well (Oleson and Stein 2007). Previous ships involved in live fish tank transport, entitled navis vivariae, did not employ a hydraulic system, and for this reason the hypothesis proves especially questionable (Boetto 124). For example, one of the wrecks found in Claudius’s harbor at the modern Fiumicino Airport in Italy was a small fish craft dating somewhere around the 2nd century CE. Archaeologists discovered a fish-well in the middle of the ship that used the hole/plump system bored in the bottom of the boat to fill the tank (Boetto 2006). Other than the Grado wreck no other evidence exists of hydraulic systems being used in the fish industry.

In sailing and boating, a vessel's freeboard is the distance from the waterline to the upper deck level, measured at the lowest point of sheer where water can enter the boat or ship. In commercial vessels, the latter criterion measured relative to the ship's load line, regardless of deck arrangements, is the mandated and regulated meaning. In yachts, a low freeboard is often found on racing boats, for increased speed (by reducing weight and therefore drag). A higher freeboard will give more room in the cabin, but will increase weight and drag, compromising speed. A higher freeboard, such as used on ocean liners, also helps weather waves and so reduce the likelihood of being washed over by full water waves on the weather deck. A low-freeboard boat is susceptible to taking in water in rough seas. Freighter ships and warships use high freeboard designs to increase internal volume, which also allows them to satisfy International Maritime Organization (IMO) damage stability regulations, due to increased reserve buoyancy.

He is credited with having brought the traditional Karagiozis plays to mass audiences through television, recordings and cinema. Biography Evgenios Spatharis was born in Kifissia in 1924, son of Sotiris Spatharis, himself a famous puppeteer. He progressively got introduced to his father's art, despite his father's reluctance, since his wish was for Evgenios to become an architect. His first public performances were during the German occupation of Greece, when he frequently used heroic themes in order to strengthen the morale of the population. During one of his shows, the Germans arrested him and brought him to the local Kommandantur for interrogation. Using an old connection of his, he managed to perform for them and they were so impressed that they decided to send him to perform to Germany. Besides being the most famous performer of Karagiozis, he was also an accomplished painter, with over 50 exhibitions of his works. He has collaborated with many of the most important Greek artists, like Manos Hadjidakis, Dionysis Savvopoulos, Rallou Manou, Stavros Xarchakos, Melina Merkouri and others. Honorary memberships and awards Spatharis was a member of the Chamber of Artists of Greece and the UNESCO International Theatre Institute. He was awarded the Rome Prize in 1962, the Toscanini medal in 1978 and several other awards, while in 2007 the Greek culture ministry awarded him the title of 'Grand Master' in recognition of his great contribution to his art. Death Spatharis was invited to an event at the Athens Goethe Institut on Wednesday, 6 May, where he was scheduled to give a lecture. While heading to the lecture room, he fell from the stairs and had a severe head injury. He was immediately transported to KAT hospital; however, he never recovered and died the following Saturday, at the age of 85. Legacy Especially in his last two decades, Spatharis enjoyed wide acclaim and respect as a towering figure of the Greek shadow theatre and of cultural life in general. His death caused a stream of encomia from critics, journalists and public figures. He created the Spathario Museum in 1991, devoted exclusively to his art.

The completed version 1.0 WiGig specification was announced in December 2009. In May 2010, WiGig announced the publication of its specification, the opening of its Adopter Program, and the liaison agreement with the Wi-Fi Alliance to cooperate on the expansion of Wi-Fi technologies.

Sadri directs all activities throughout the alliance, from leading the board of directors to providing support for the technical working groups.  History  The Wireless gigabit alliance set about its task for creating faster and more efficient communications technology in 2007. Their idea was to set about creating wirelessly interconnected home entertainment and office devices, like PCs, tablets, smartphones and displays, entirely removing the need for wires. They also wanted devices to be constantly connected and ready to transfer. Thus eliminating the need to have both a laptop and a tablet, as a device could connect straight to a display. In May 2009, the alliance announced something, and WiGig 1.0, announced in December of the same year. In 2010, WiGig and the Wi-Fi alliance announced a cooperation agreement. The agreement combined 60 GHz with traditional Wi-Fi networking that extended the range at slower speeds and helped signals to go through walls to cover entire homes. On November 3, 2010, the WiGig Alliance and the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) announced an association to define the next generation standard wireless display technology. VESA and WiGig Alliance agreed to share technology specifications to develop multi-gigabit wireless Display Port capabilities. The official standard was published by the Standards Association of the IEEE in December 2012 as IEEE 802.11ad-2012 as an amendment to the overall IEEE 802.11 standard family. In January 2013, after more than two years of collaboration, the Wireless Gigabit Alliance announced it would merge with the Wi-Fi Alliance. The merger was finalized in March. Although no longer a separate organization, the WiGig technology kept its name, with the Wi-Fi Alliance planning to jointly certify both devices in late 2013. On September 9, 2013, a statement revealed that the WiGig protocol would be used in a new wireless version of USB through a deal between the Wi-Fi Alliance and the USB Implementers Forum. The Wireless USB standard would use existing USB 2.0 and 3.0 drivers. The Wi-Fi alliance transferred WiGig wireless transmission technology to the USB Implementers Forum as it is expected that WiGig certified products will implement USB functionality.  Applications  On November 3, 2010, WiGig Alliance announced the WiGig version 1.0 A/V and I/O protocol adaptation layer (PAL) specifications. The application specifications have been developed to support specific system interfaces including extensions for PC peripherals and display interfaces for HDTVs, monitors and projectors. WiGig Display Extension *Supports wireless transmission of audio/visual data *Enables wireless DisplayPort and other display interfaces that include the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection 2.0 feature. *Offers key A/V applications, such as the transmission of lightly compressed or uncompressed video from a computer or digital camera to an HDTV, monitor or projector WiGig Bus Extension and WiGig Serial Extension. The WiGig Bus Extension (WBE) was available to members in 2011. *Define high-performance wireless implementations of widely used computer interfaces over 60 GHz *Enable multi- gigabit wireless connectivity between any two devices, such as connection to storage and other high-speed peripherals  License  On May 10, 2010, the Wi-Fi Alliance and WiGig Alliance announced a cooperation agreement for multi- gigabit wireless networking. The Wi-Fi Alliance and the WiGig Alliance shared technology specifications for the development of a Wi-Fi Alliance certification program supporting Wi-Fi operation in the 60 GHz frequency band. On November 3, 2010, the WiGig Alliance and the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) announced a liaison for standard wireless display technology. VESA and WiGig Alliance agreed to share technology specifications to develop multi-gigabit wireless DisplayPort capabilities and create a certification program for wireless DisplayPort products. On June 28, 2011, the WiGig Alliance announced becoming an Adopter of HDMI Licensing, LLC to further provide WiGig Display Extension (WDE) support for HDMI mapping. WDE is the only 60 GHz specification that defines a framework to connect to DisplayPort monitors and HDMI TVs, enabling applications such as the wireless transmission of compressed or uncompressed video.

Early and personal life He was born Naeemuddin Khan on May 21, 1958 in Bareilly, India to Sharfuddin Khan and Razia Baig. His father and grandfather cultivated an early interest in textiles, as they both designed intricate clothing worn by the royal families. Of his early passion for design, Khan has said, \\"It was built into my DNA. I watched my father design formal wear for India's most influential people, and I knew that I would want to pursue a similar path.\\" In 1981, at the age of 23, he married model and jewelry designer Ranjana Kapadia, with whom he has two sons, Zaheen and Shariq. Khan lives in New York City, and Miami, Florida Career In 1978, Khan moved to the United States to apprentice for legendary American designer Halston. During this time, he mastered the art of draping and garment construction, and worked with cultural icons such as Liza Minnelli, Andy Warhol, and Elizabeth Taylor. Of this period, Khan says, \\"My knowledge of fashion and lifestyle is much influenced by my time with Halston… as a designer you have to be aware of the various arts, travels, cinema, museums, culture and geography in order to be a world recognized brand.\\" Khan spent several years after his apprenticeship continuing to work with Halston on a freelance basis, going on to launch fashion house Riazee in 1981, a clothing label named after his mother that was carried in prominent American retail stores for about a decade. In 2003, he launched his eponymous label and began showing his collections at New York Fashion Week with immediate reception by the world's top retailers and notable celebrities. Khan's gowns have been worn by Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez, Penélope Cruz, Katy Perry and Kate Hudson, among others. First Lady Michelle Obama has worn the brand on over ten occasions, beginning in 2009 at her first state dinner. In April 2016, the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, wore a Naeem Khan dress on her visit to the Taj Mahal with Prince William in Agra, India.

Commissioner, 9 T.C. 727 (1947) was a United States income tax case which discussed whether, and how much, basis the taxpayer could recover to offset a gain from compensation from the government for an easement on his land. HELD: :1. The $50,000 that petitioner received from the City -- for a right of way and an easement on taxpayer's land, and releasing the city from all claims and demands, etc. -- was lost (present) capital rather than lost (future) profits; i.e. it should be chargeable to the capital account for land, rather than treated as taxable income under I.R.C. § 22(a) [today § 61(a)].(a). :2. Since, under the circumstances, it was practically impossible to allocate a basis to the easements granted, entirety of the net amount received will be recovered from that basis. Facts In 1928, the taxpayer paid $61,000 for of land on a river bank. In 1934, the City diverted polluted waters upstream from the taxpayer's property, adversely affecting the fishing on the taxpayer's property and causing flooding and erosion. The city settled with the taxpayer for $50,000; net of legal fees, taxpayer's gain was $49,000. Issues Does the $49,000 constitute taxable income under Section 61(a), or is it chargeable to the taxpayer's capital account? If the latter, how much basis should be recovered? Holding and Decision The Tax Court held that the payment was return of capital rather than lost profits. It should be chargeable to the taxpayer's capital account, as a reduction of the taxpayer's cost basis. Because the recovery did not exceed the basis of the property, it was not yet taxable. Agreeing with the taxpayer that it is impracticable to accurately apportion a basis to the easements, the entirety of the net amount received will be reduced from that basis. Academic Commentary How much basis should be recovered from an easement? -- Three different cost recovery methods each has something to recommend it: :1) treat easement as leasehold (analogizing the award to dividends/rent, since land, like stock, is perpetual): ::*postpone recovery of any costs until ultimate sale: the remaining land retains its basis until eventual sale, and the award is fully taxed. ::*leasehold cases-- see Commissioner v. Gillette Motor Transport, Inc., 364 U.S. 130 (1960)., Hort v. Commissioner, 313 U.S. 28 (1941). :2) treat easement as unit sale of a section of land (since the easement is perpetual, and represents a forced divestment of the taxpayer's original property) ::*recover only the cost properly allocable to the fraction sold (even if the sale made the unsold land less attractive: that would just impact the basis of what remains.) :3) treat easement as open-ended installment sale or a down payment on the final purchase price (which today is uncertain) ::*recover costs out of the earliest proceeds of disposition -- the basis of the remaining land is diminished accordingly. ::*Inaja held this way: since properly allocating proceeds to easement would require an appraisal of the remaining land.)

Anna Vasilyevna Timiryova (; 18 July 1893 – 31 January 1975) was a Russian poet. Born Anna Safonova, she was the daughter of composer Vasily Ilyich Safonov. At the age of 19 she married Admiral Sergey Nikolayevich Timiryov with whom she soon had a son, but whom she divorced in 1918 to join her beloved, Admiral Alexander Kolchak. After Kolchak's execution in 1920, she was arrested several times and served several prison and labour camp sentences. In 1923 she married Vsevolod Kniper, a railroad engineer. She was the mother of painter Vladimir Sergeyevich Timiryov. Early life Anna Vasilyevna Safonova was born in Kislovodsk into the family of a musician and later the manager of the Moscow Music Conservatory, Vassily Ilyich Safonov. Kislovodsk is a spa town in the region of Stavropol in the north of the Caucasus. (Coincidentally, Kislovodsk was also the birthplace of another victim of Communism, Alexander Solzhenitsyn.) At the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, Kislovodsk welcomed many artists, musicians and members of the Russian nobility. Education In 1906, the Safonov family moved to St. Petersburg, where Anna studied and graduated from the school of Princess Anna Obolensky, learned drawing and painting with Zeidenberg, and also became fluent in French and German. In 1911, she married a Naval officer, Sergey Timiryov (Сергей Тимирев, 1875–1932). In 1914, she gave birth to a son, named Vladimir. Scandal In 1915, she was introduced to the Rear Admiral Alexander Kolchak. Although Kolchak was her husband's closest friend and commanding officer, and had a family of his own, they began a clandestine affair. In 1917, Timiryova left her husband for Kolchak. Russian Civil War In years 1918-1919, Timiryova worked as a translator for the Department of Business Service at the Council of Ministers - an agency within Kolchak's anti-communist government in Siberia. After Kolchak was handed over to Bolsheviks, Timiryova approached them and declared: \\"Arrest me. I cannot live without him.\\" As a result, she was imprisoned in Irkutsk but was released after Kolchak's execution in February 1920. This, however, was only the beginning of a long string of her arrests, prison and labour camp sentences, and years of internal exile. The Gulag archipelago After Kolchak's death, Timiryova was released as part of the amnesty. In June 1920, however, she was arrested again and sent to a forced labor camp in Omsk. After being released from the camp, Timiryova appealed to the local authorities for permission to join her first husband in Harbin. Her request was denied and she received an additional year of imprisonment instead. The third imprisonment followed in 1922, the fourth one – in 1925. Official charges read \\"accused of undesirable connections with foreigners and former White officers.\\" She was sentenced to 3 more years in prison. After she was released, Timiryova married a railway engineer Vladimir Kniper. But her sufferings continued. In the spring of 1935, she was arrested again for \\"concealment of the past\\", and sent to a labor camp again. Later, this sentence was changed to internal exile in Vyshny Volochek and Maloyaroslavets. There she earned her living by sewing, knitting and sweeping the streets. In 1938, however, she was arrested for the sixth time. She was released only after the end of the Second World War. She had no close family members left: her 24-year son, the artist Vladimir Timirev had been shot on 17 May 1938. Her husband Vladimir Kniper died from a heart attack in 1942. She was still not allowed to live in Moscow, and she moved to Scherbakov (present Rybinsk) in Yaroslavskaya Oblast, where she was offered the position of a property manager at a local drama theatre. At the very same time as Timiryova lived in Rybinsk, Admiral Kolchak's niece, Olga, was also living there. Several times Timiryova made attempts to meet with Olga, but Olga refused. According to one account, she did not want to meet the woman who \\"destroyed her uncle's family\\". According to another, Olga was afraid of the secret police. At the end of 1949, Timiryova was imprisoned for the seventh's time, this time for nine months in Yaroslavl, and as a deported convict she was sent to Yeniseisk. Timiryova was said to have been denounced by her coworkers – the actors at the drama theatre. They accused her of spreading Anti-Soviet propaganda. \\"Khrushchev thaw\\" After Timiryova was released, she returned to the Rybinsk drama theatre. She was in her 70s, but she continued working. Timiryova could turn her hand to anything. She was a woman of considerable talent; when she was young, she drew and painted in private studio, and while in exile, she worked as toy-painting instructor and graphic designer. She made beautifully carved gilded frames from paste impregnated papers covered with painter's gold. The frames looked as if they were real. At a theatre performance, there was a huge vase on the stage. In the footlights it shone as a diamond. Theatre veterans said that she made the vase from wire and pieces of cans. Often, during the performance, Timiryova sat among the audience to note how everything looked on the stage. Sometimes she even took part in performance, playing small parts, such as Princess Myagkaya in Anna Karenina. In her letters to the loved ones she admitted \\"I don't like the stage and I'm bored in make-up room. I feel as a property manager, not as an actress, but it seems to me that I'm not out of the picture (it does no honour to the performing style) Please bring me a box of make-up, I can't find it here and I don't like to beg somebody for it.\\" She was neat, well-mannered old lady with short grey hair and bright lively eyes. Nobody in the drama theatre knew about her, or about her and Kolchak's tragic love story. But to the surprise of others, every time when the director, a respectable man of noble birth, saw Timiryova, he kissed her hand. People talked in corners about such attention devoted to the property manager. \\"I'm 65 and I'm in exile. Everything that happened 35 years ago is gone down in history. I have no idea who and why want that the last days of my life passed in such unbearable conditions. I ask you to put an end to it, do away with it and let me breathe and live that time which is left for me,\\" she wrote to Premier Georgy Malenkov in 1954. But she was rehabilitated only in 1960. She was then granted a small room in a communal flat on Pluschikha Street, Moscow. After long efforts, Shostakovich and Oystrakh obtained a small pension for her (45 rubles) thanks to her father's services as a composer. Timiryova appeared in a crowd scene of Gaidai's 'Diamond hand' playing the part of charwoman and in Sergei Bondarchuk's War and Peace, playing the part of noble old lady at Natasha Rostova's first ball. She died in Moscow on 31 January 1975. Poet In the years following the execution of her beloved, Timiryova composed many poems dedicated to his memory. In popular culture Timiryova was depicted onscreen by Veronica Izotova in the 1993 miniseries The White Horse and by Elizaveta Boyarskaya in the movie Admiral from 2008. Veronica Izotova recalled, > I put on a red make-up using a brick. My face was dirty, my sad eyes, my > clothes torn, and I have to walk many hours... I wanted to play the Snow > Queen. I was always more expressive and more sensitive than the average of > my compatriots. Elizaveta Boyarskaya commented, > She was a woman of such force, of such will, with such magnanimity... I feel > an amazing resemblance to her... When I read script, I was even a bit > scared: because she has the same vision of history as me. All that it can > arrive at is me. And when I played Anna, I did not play, I was her. It was > my epoch, my attitude regarding love. After being asked about Doctor Zhivago, she said, > The only thing that these two films share consists in the love which the > Russian women can carry; it is a topic approached by many novels. They love > up to the last drop of blood, till the most dreadful end, to the death; they > are capable of leaving family and children for the love of the man which > they have chosen. Music The main original song for the film Admiral is called Anna. She is interpreted by the Russian singer Viktoria Dayneko. The music of the song was composed by Igor Matvienko and the words were written by Timiryova in memory of her lover, Admiral Kolchak.

Support for the Movement for Change \\"stems from the simple fact that it is the new, dynamic, fresh option in Kurdistan\\" and its \\"calls for an end to monopoly control of power\\". One of Gorran's main objectives is to \\"uproot rampant corruption\\". The party is particularly popular with the youth of Kurdistan and campaigns against patronage. It consists of a mix of (former) PUK/KDP members, Peshmerga, and academics. Gorran supporters have often faced \\"violent intimidation\\". Gorran have stated in The Economist that \\"the KDP and PUK have done a poor job of promoting the Kurds’ interests at the federal parliament in Baghdad\\". The party in the 2009 and 2010 elections \\"won in the city and the province of Sulaimaniyah\\". =2009 Kurdistan Region parliamentary election and 2010 Iraqi parliamentary election= The Change List won a total of 25 seats in the July 2009 elections, making it the second-most successful list in the election after the Kurdistani List. The party viewed the election results as a huge victory. The movement's platform for the 2009 election was to de-politicise the regional government, strengthen the judiciary, limit political interference in the economy and make the budget more transparent. Supporting federalism for Iraq, it said disputes with the central government could be solved through dialogue based on the Iraqi Constitution. Considered to be the main opposition to Kurdistan List, particularly in areas dominated by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The campaign focused on addressing what it sees as corruption undertaken by the Kurdistan Democratic Party and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. It managed to win eight seats. =2013 Kurdistan Region parliamentary election and 2014 Iraqi parliamentary election= Gorran won 24 seats in the 2013 Kurdistan Region parliamentary election and 9 seats in the 2014 Iraqi parliamentary election. =2011 Kurdish protests in Iraq= In 2011 the party called for the resignation of the Cabinet and the disbanding of the Kurdistan Regional Government during the protests in Kurdistan that followed the 2011 Egyptian protests. This was accompanied by protests against the Kurdistan Regional Government and the Kurdistan Democratic Party.https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gvqM5KohOmVipuRKfb39gRT968oQ?docId=6029572 Some have criticized the party for causing unnecessary unrest, arguing that there is no need for the Kurdish government to step down. Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch have urged protests to be allowed. February 17, 2011, Human Rights Watch reported security guards firing on protesters in Sulaimaniya, killing at least one person and wounding more than 33 others after the crowd threw rocks at the political headquarters of the KDP. Since there were shootings which led to deaths, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called for an independent investigation into the killings.  Gorran under Omar Said Ali Following death of the party leader, Nawshirwan Mustafa, in May 2017, an internal ballot was held to elect a new leader, Omar Said Ali, and six other executive assembly members. =2018 Kurdistan Region parliamentary election and 2018 Iraqi parliamentary election= Under the new leadership of Omar Said Ali, Gorran failed to present a lasting challenge to the KDP-PUK duopoly and the movement's popularity has been declining. As a result Gorran suffered a harsh blow winning only 12 seats in the 2018 Kurdistan parliamentary election and only 5 seats in the 2018 Iraqi parliamentary election. The total number of votes for Gorran has shrunk by 60 percent since previous elections and Gorran has lost a significant number of followers and prominent members. Gorran officials are also concerned to an extent about the future of the party, saying it “faces a deadly failure” and has been dogged with infighting. Gorran leadership was criticised for their handling of the referendum, as they had initially opposed the timing of the referendum but eventually supported holding it in September 2017 amid intense political pressure. New Generation, a movement founded by Shaswar Abdulwahid, has taken in Gorran defectors, New Generation has been described as stepping forward as Gorran has fallen back. The biggest crisis facing Gorran and the source of many of its recent failings and resulting loss of popularity is the ongoing dispute over the parties assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars and include shares in several ongoing projects, including Gasin cement company and metro supermarket as well as 305,000 square meters of land property including the Gorran party headquarters which were secretly seized by Nawshirwan Mustafa's two sons after his death during the funeral while party supporters were in mourning. The brothers’ ownership of the property is seen by many in a negative light and drew allegations of hypocrisy and nepotism, one of the things Gorran was established against. The decision caused a public and political backlash when it was exposed in the independent newspaper Awena, and a growing number of middle- and high-ranking officials as well as grass-roots supporters are adding their voices to the uproar within the party. Mariwan Kanie, a former supporter of the party, has said their claims have damaged the principles of the party and this issue could lead to a disaster which will bring Gorran to its political end. As a result of Gorran's political direction and subsequent failings after the death of Nawshirwan Mustafa, the party is now split between two main rival factions. The first faction is responsible for all decisions post-19 May 2017 and is seen as wanting to turn Gorran into a family-based party led by Omar Said Ali, Mustafa Said Qadir, Mohammad Tofiq Rahim and Nawshirwan's two sons. The second faction rejects Gorran becoming a family-based party and is led by Othman Haji Mahmud, Qadir Hagi Ali, Aram Ahmad and Abdulay Mala Nuri. Corruption of Chia Nawshirwan and Nma Nawshirwan within Gorran have been exposed in the media, prominent members have called for their expulsion from the party by Omar Said Ali \\"for the sake of Gorran’s interest and staying on the right path\\", the dirty deals have been facilitated by members of the KRG cabinet, one such corrupt deal has been identified concerns two valuable pieces of land belonging to the government which are 75,000 m2 and 125,000 m2 in size. Kamal Salim Gorran's Minister of Trade and Industry in the KRG cabinet has signed the deals for Chia and Nma who are accused of betraying and selling out their father Nawshirwan Mustafa. In another example of Chia Nawshirwan and Nma Nawshirwan's on going corruption scandals, their links with Sulaimani Provincial Council member Muhammad Sheikh Wahab has been exposed, Wahab under Article 289 of the Iraqi Penal Code, which criminalizes falsifying official documents is facing charges of falsifying customs bills worth $10 million in which Nma and Chia are implicated. Chia also called Chiya Nawshirwan was born in Iran and holds a bachelors degree in economics and master’s degree in Politics and International Relations both from Harvard University.

East Anglian Ice and Cold Storage Company, founded by William Fredrick Cockrell In 1897, purchased a section of quay on south side of Lake Lothing from LNER, linking to Riverside Road, with sidings for coal delivery. The Ice factory produced 75 tons of ice per day and was powered by 300 horsepower horizontal double-acting Robey steam engine,this was fired by a team of eight stokers. The steam powered via the Robey, one huge three- cylinder Peter Brotherhood ammonia compressor, with water taken from Lake Lothing via triple acting brass suction pumps to cool the ammonia condenser coils. The factory moved from Riverside road to the main harbour in 1962 to facilitate better loading of ice to the trawler fleet. The ice company was renamed The Lowestoft Ice Company. It closed Ice production in 1988 after 100 years. The factory still stands today, empty as a reminder of the huge impact on the expansion of the Lowestoft fishing industry, of which without the ice factory, the preservation of fish would have been greatly reduced.

The original Inner Harbour was constructed in 1831 when the Lake Lothing joined to the sea, as shown on a chart based on a survey by William Hewett, Commander of HMS Fairy dated 1834 and the Outer Harbour in 1937. The railway line ran alongside the north side of the docks and a series of docks railway sidings were used mainly for fishing and freight wagons. These lines have mainly been removed from service but in places sections of the track can still be seen. The development of the harbour led to a rapid growth in the fishing industry and associated engineering and ship building companies such as Brooke Marine, Richards and Boulton and Paul.

Ballotpedia was sponsored by the Sam Adams Alliance in 2008, along with Judgepedia and Sunshine Review. In 2009, their sponsorship was transferred to the nonprofit Lucy Burns Institute, based in Middleton, Wisconsin. On July 9, 2013, Sunshine Review was acquired by the Lucy Burns Institute and merged into Ballotpedia. The Lucy Burns Institute is named after suffragist Lucy Burns who along with Alice Paul founded the National Woman's Party. Judgepedia was merged into Ballotpedia in March 2015. In May 2018, in response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence elections, Twitter announced that it would partner with Ballotpedia to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates running for election in the U.S. During the 2018 United States elections, Ballotpedia supplied Amazon Alexa with information on polling place locations and political candidates. Judgepedia Judgepedia was an online wiki-style encyclopedia covering the American legal system. In 2015, all content from Judgepedia was merged into Ballotpedia. It included a database of information on state and federal courts and judges. According to its original website, the goal of Judgepedia was \\"to help readers discover and learn useful information about the court systems and judiciary in the United States.\\" Judgepedia was sponsored by the Sam Adams Alliance in 2007, along with Ballotpedia and Sunshine Review. In 2009, sponsorship of Judgepedia was transferred to the Lucy Burns Institute, which merged Judgepedia into Ballotpedia in March 2015. Judgepedia had a weekly publication titled Federal Courts, Empty Benches which tracked the vacancy rate for Article III federal judicial posts.

Judgepedia's profile of Elena Kagan was included in the Harvard Law School Library's guide to Kagan's Supreme Court nomination and the Law Library of Congress's guide to Kagan. Reception and studies When actress Regina King won an Emmy at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2020, during her acceptance speech she encouraged people to use Ballotpedia to prepare for the upcoming election. In 2018, Ballotpedia, ABC News, and FiveThirtyEight collected and analyzed data on candidates in Democratic Party primaries in order to determine which types of candidates Democratic primary voters were gravitating towards. Ballotpedia has helped spotlight the unnecessarily complex language used in various U.S. ballot measures. In 2017, with a sample of 27 issues from nine states, the group determined that, on average, ballot descriptions required a graduate-level education to understand the complex wording of issues, with the average American adult only reading at a 7th to 8th grade reading level. A Georgia State University analysis of 1200 ballot measures over a decade showed that voters were more likely to skip complex issues altogether. Further, some ballot language confuses potential voters with the use of double negatives. A few states require plain-language explanations of ballot wording. In 2015, Harvard University visiting scholar Carl Klarner conducted a study for Ballotpedia which found that state legislative elections have become less competitive over time, with 2014's elections being the least competitive elections in the past 40 years. Ballotpedia has been mentioned in The Washington Post' politics blog, \\"The Fix\\"; in The Wall Street Journal; and in Politico.

Founded in 1999, H5 combines advanced proprietary information retrieval technologies with professional expertise in linguistics, statistics, computer science, law, information technology, process engineering and e-discovery. The company completed its third and latest round of venture capital funding in 2005; its primary investors are the private equity firms of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), and Walden VC. H5 has attracted positive attention for its promotion of common standards in the field of information retrieval,http://wilsonig.com/2009/07/15/catch-22-for-e- discovery-standards/ including its participation in the U.S. Government’s TREC Legal Track initiative, a research program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that measures the accuracy of document review and search methods for e-discovery. H5 was profiled in an October 2007 Forbes article noting the company’s prominent Advisory Board members and its 2007 Thought Leadership Summit that the company co-hosted with Georgetown Law. At that summit, United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer joined a panel discussion alongside H5 CEO Nicolas Economou and moderator Arthur R. Miller of Harvard Law School.  Processes  H5’s proprietary automated document review process is a hybrid approach that relies on both human subject matter expertise and advanced information retrieval technologies. The company utilizes academically validated quality assurance methods, based on the government’s TREC Legal Track protocols, to measure the accuracy of its results. H5’s process and results have been evaluated by a variety of independent industry and government studies, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s 2008 TREC Legal Track study, as well as a 2005 independent academic study which compared H5’s process against a team of attorneys using traditional manual document review methodologies on a 48,000 document collection. (The manual review process found 51% of all relevant documents vs. H5’s retrieval rate of 95%.)  H5's name  H5’s name derives from what it considers to be the historical analogy between 18th century inventor John Harrison’s fourth marine chronometer (known as “H4”), which provided an accurate measurement of navigational longitude (thereby unlocking the world’s ocean for accurate navigation) and its own modern process by which to precisely navigate through vast amounts of electronic data.  Client engagements  Although H5 does not disclose its clients on its website, the company has been publicly reported to work on cases involving RealNetworks, Microsoft, and Tyco, as well as with prominent law firms such as O’Melveny & Myers, Boies Schiller & Flexner, and Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar & Scott.

Early life Born at Rotenburg an der Fulda in Hesse, Germany, she was the daughter of Ernest Leopold, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg, head of the Roman Catholic branch of the House of Hesse, by his wife, Countess Eleonore of Löwenstein- Wertheim-Rochefort. She was one of ten children. Marriage Caroline de Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, by an unknown artist. On 24 July 1728, she married Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, at Sarry in France. Louis Henri was a French prince of the Blood Royal and head of the House of Condé, a branch of the House of Bourbon. Maternally, he was a grandson of Louis XIV of France through his mother, one of the king's legitimated daughters. By the time of his second marriage to Caroline, Louis Henri had lost the sight of one eye and the attractive slenderness his height bestowed upon him in youth.Meyrac's footnote in d'Angerville, p. 33. After marriage she was known at the French court as Madame la Duchesse. The previous Princess of Condé had been Marie Anne de Bourbon, who had died eight years before the marriage between Caroline and Louis Henri. Caroline was alleged to have been pretty and to have been included on a list of possible wives for Louis XV of France, but had been removed on account of her bad temper. When her husband was banished to his estates in 1725, Madame la Duchesse was obliged to withdraw with him to the Château de Chantilly until Monsieur le Duc was pardoned and the couple were allowed to resume attendance at the royal court again in 1730, where they lived quietly at the Hôtel de Condé. The couple had one child eight years into their marriage: Louis Joseph de Bourbon. Her husband died at the Château de Chantilly on 27 January 1740, in the same year the future Marquis de Sade was born at the Hôtel de Condé; his mother was Caroline's lady in waiting. Caroline died in Paris one year later, in June 1741, and was buried at the Carmel du faubourg Saint-Jacques in Paris. Legacy In 1745, her niece Princess Viktoria of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, would marry Charles, Prince of Soubise, head of the junior branch of the House of Rohan and father of Charlotte de Rohan, who would also marry a Prince of Condé. In 1767, one of her nieces, Princess Maria Luisa of Savoy, would come to France to marry the young Louis Alexandre de Bourbon. She would become the great friend of Marie Antoinette as the princesse de Lamballe and be murdered by a revolutionary mob in Paris during the September Massacres of 1792.

Coming from Scania, then part of Denmark, now part of modern-day Sweden, Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer and alchemist. He died in Prague. Recent investigations have suggested that Tycho did not die from urinary problems but instead from mercury poisoning--extremely toxic levels of it have been found in hairs from his moustache. The results were, however, not conclusive. Prague City Hall approved a request by Danish scientists to exhume the remains in February 2010, and a team of Czech and Danish scientists from Aarhus University arrived in November 2010, to take bone, hair and clothing samples for analysis.

William Loeb Jr. (October 9, 1866 - September 19, 1937) was an American political figure. He was the Presidential secretary to President Theodore Roosevelt and Collector of the Port of New York from 1909 to 1913. He was the father of William Loeb III, the conservative publisher of the Manchester Union Leader. Early life and career William Loeb Jr. was born in Albany, New York. He was the son of Louisa (Meyer) and William Loeb, a barber. His father was a Prussian immigrant and his mother was also of German origin. He attended the public schools of Albany and was a graduate of Albany High School . At the age of 12 he took his first job as secretary to Bishop William Croswell Doane, the first Bishop of Albany. He became a stenographer and court reporter, and developed an interest in politics. Loeb served as secretary to the Republican county committee of Albany County and as vice president of the Unconditional Republican Club. In 1888 he was elected official stenographer of the New York State Assembly, and over the years gained political experience and acquaintances serving as private secretaries to the Lieutenant-Governor, President pro tempore of the State Senate, Speaker of the Assembly and to 1891 candidate for Governor Jacob Sloat Fassett during whose campaign he toured the state with as well as reporting on the debates of the 1894 New York State Constitutional Convention. Roosevelt's right-hand man 1909 cartoon: TR hands his policies to the care of Taft while William Loeb Jr. carries the \\"Big Stick\\" When Theodore Roosevelt became Governor of New York he was appointed as one of his official stenographers. His ability to do things without specific instructions and his familiarity with public officials and affairs attracted Roosevelt's notice and Loeb became his private secretary in 1899. On September 14, 1901, on the night President William McKinley died after being assassinated eight days earlier, Loeb met Vice President Roosevelt during his dash to Buffalo at the North Creek, New York train station delivering the telegram from Secretary of State John Hay announcing McKinley's death at 2:15 that morning. In the White House he served as assistant secretary to the President from 1901 to 1903, and then succeeded George B. Cortelyou as Secretary to the President in 1903 where he stayed by the President's side for the rest of Roosevelt's time in office. Loeb was a very intimate aide to Roosevelt and was one of the era's most powerful figures. As Roosevelt's principal advisor he participated in shaping policy and solving political problems. Acting as the President's public alter-ego, he unofficially became the nation's first presidential press secretary, as Loeb was empowered to speak for the President and reporters were able to contact him twenty-four hours a day. Known to those in the press as \\"Stonewall Loeb\\", he controlled access to the President in an unprecedented fashion, dealing with the queries of most of the President's visitors without their ever having to disturb him. When Roosevelt took to learning judo (then known as jiu-jitsu) from Yamashita Yoshitsugu in March and April 1904 and trained in the White House, Loeb and the President's Japanese naval attaché, Isamu Takeshita, were his training partners.New York Sun, April 17, 1904.Svinth, Joseph R. \\"Professor Yamashita Goes to Washington.\\" Roosevelt once described him as \\"The best secretary that any President ever had\\". In addition, in his own autobiography, Roosevelt stated that Loeb was responsible for starting the investigations into the frauds committed by the Sugar Trust in New York's Custom House. He also played a part in aligning the 1908 Republican National Convention behind the nomination of William H. Taft. In January 1908 he brought it to the President's attention that there was no front-runner for the Republican nomination to succeed him and that many Republican leaders in the United States Congress were under the suspicion that Roosevelt had every intention of running for a third term. Loeb urged the President that he would only be able to sustain the credibility of his pledge not to run again by endorsing a candidate. Loeb told Roosevelt that any nominee could win if only he would back him. In response, Roosevelt said that he would favor Elihu Root and authorized Loeb at that moment to go to see Root and make the offer of his endorsement. Root, then Secretary of State, was astonished by the endorsement but did not accept it because he judged himself to be unelectable. Loeb reported back to the President that same day to report on his meeting. Roosevelt accepted Root's decision and told Loeb that his choice then was William Howard Taft, saying that he had the experience to run the government. Post White House From March 1909 to 1913 He was appointed by President Taft Collector of the Port of New York. He later went on to become Vice President of the American Smelting and Refining Company and retired to a quiet life in Oyster Bay where he lived with his wife and son, William Loeb III. William Loeb Jr. died on 19 September 1937 in Glen Cove, Nassau County, New York, at age 70.

History The AIPA, from which the CNIPA is partly inherited, was established in 1993 in a climate of concern for the efficiency of public administration. That climate, prevalent in many developed countries, is reflected in particular by the National Program for Reinventing Government launched in the U.S. by Bill Clinton and Al Gore in the same year. Legislative Decree 39/1993 had outlined the AIPA in part as an independent and partly as an agency operative. Were provided for both tasks of monitoring the market of information public through the issuance of fairness opinions on technical and economic contracts concluded by more administrations of the state, both the tasks of promotion and implementation of large infrastructure projects, such as the United Network of public administration or the linking of databases and information systems of each administration. Besides these tasks, the AIPA also had to perform functions of public monitoring of data and produce annual reports to the Government and Parliament. An article by Manlio Cammarata published in 1994 (Public administration: the future begins?) May be useful to understand the context and the tensions within which the AIPA began to operate. Over the following years, the AIPA, however, failed to find a complete organizational and institutional placement. A turning point came in 2001 when, at the change of government, the dell'AIPA contribution to the achievement of its objectives was the object of heavy criticism, expressed repeatedly in the press by the new Minister for Innovation and Technology, Lucio Stanca (Report Italiamonitor 10/2003 - Minister Stanca). As promised by the government, after many vicissitudes the AIPA legislation was abolished in 2003 and absorbed along with the Technical Center of RUPA (United Network of Public Administration) from CNIPA. It is not easy to give a comprehensive assessment of the work and dell'AIPA CNIPA. An important part of the official documentation is not available on site. Fairness opinions on major contracts, for example, are published only some summary statistics with details of the potential savings that would be obtained. Even after the work of CNIPA was bound by law to implement a plan of government e-government published periodic reports on the achievement of objectives. Finally awakened surprise that a body should be one of the main instruments of innovation in public administration since 1993 is devoid of a regulation of staff and therefore must rely, as required by its standard set-up, only to personnel of other government employees and precarious.

This radar could provide bearing and distance information, but no altitude information. The small-ship antenna (Type SPS-29) looked like a bedspring. Larger ships used the 12.8 m wide SPS-37 antenna - about twice as wide and half the height of the SPS-29 antenna - and designed with a much narrower beam. Targets were much more accurately displayed when using the -37 antenna. The -43 operated at VHF frequency - somewhat unusual for any radar - mostly in the bandwidth of television channel 13. The main difference to the SPS-37 was the greatly improved ECCM performance, as the AN/SPS-43 could jump between 20 different frequencies to frustrate jamming attempts. A sea-skimming missile could be detected at a range distance of 30 km, a large high-flying aircraft at 500 km. The SPS-43 also included MTI (Moving Target Indication) which enabled the operator to eliminate all stationary targets from his screen, but this was notoriously unreliable in practice given that it was, along with the rest of the electronics, entirely a vacuum-tube design. Vacuum tubes, operating at temperatures requiring cooling - or least properly ventilated cabinets - suffer varying temperatures in operation, so maintaining the constant output pulse leading edge - phase-coherency - (required for proper delay-line timing) was well-nigh impossible. Some operators took it upon themselves to bore a small hole in the front panel of the MTI timing cabinet through which to insert a screwdriver, enabling adjustment of a critical potentiometer without having to open and close the cabinet. This prevented the resulting heat loss and subsequent heat buildup which threw off all adjustments. Even this enterprising idea was of little help. SPS-43 MTIs went largely unused in regular operation. Typically, the -43 would detect the range and bearing of a target at long range, the target would then be picked up by a 3-D radar such as the AN/SPS-30 (or later the AN/SPS-48), which, assuming the target to be hostile would present the target information to a fire-control radar like the AN/SPG-55. The -55 was a very directional radar that would lock on to a target, which then would cause a missile to launch and \\"ride the beam\\" to the target. 49 SPS-43 radars were produced and mostly installed on aircraft carriers and World War II-cruisers converted to guided missile cruisers. Also a few amphibious command ships received the radar. The last ship to be equipped with SPS-43 was .Stefan Terzibaschitsch: Kampfsysteme der U.S. Navy.

The executable is available free at the FEHM Website. The capabilities of the code have expanded over the years to include multiphase flow of heat and mass with air, water, and CO2, methane hydrate, plus multi- component reactive chemistry and both thermal and mechanical stress. Applications of this code include simulations of: flow and transport in basin scale groundwater systems , migration of environmental isotopes in the vadose zone, geologic carbon sequestration, oil shale extraction, geothermal energy, migration of both nuclear and chemical contaminants, methane hydrate formation, seafloor hydrothermal circulation, and formation of karst. The simulator has been used to generate results for more than 100 peer reviewed publications which can be found at FEHM Publications. Abstract The Subsurface Flow and Transport Team at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has been involved in large scale projects including performance assessment of Yucca Mountain, Environmental Remediation of the Nevada Test Site, the LANL Groundwater Protection Program and geologic CO2 sequestration. Subsurface physics has ranged from single fluid/single phase fluid flow when simulating basin scale groundwater aquifers to multi-fluid/multi-phase fluid flow when simulating the movement of air and water (with boiling and condensing) in the unsaturated zone surrounding a potential nuclear waste storage facility. These and other projects have motivated the development of software to assist in both scientific discovery and technical evaluation. LANL’s FEHM (Finite Element Heat and Mass) computer code simulates complex coupled subsurface processes as well flow in large and geologically complex basins. Its development has spanned several decades; a time over which the art and science of subsurface flow and transport simulation has dramatically evolved. For most early researchers, models were used primarily as tools for understanding subsurface processes. Subsequently, in addition to addressing purely scientific questions, models were used in technical evaluation roles. Advanced model analysis requires a detailed understanding of model errors (numerical dispersion and truncation) as well as those associated with the application (conceptual and calibration) Application errors are evaluated through exploration of model and parameter sensitivities and uncertainties. The development of FEHM has been motivated subsurface physics of applications and also by the requirements of model calibration, uncertainty quantification, and error analysis. FEHM possesses unique features and capabilities that are of general interest to the subsurface flow and transport community and it is well suited to hydrology, geothermal, petroleum reservoir applications, and CO2 sequestration. Commercialization Recently FEHM has been embedded into SVOFFICE™5/WR from SoilVision Systems Ltd, a GUI driven water resources numerical modeling framework. This marriage of GUI functionality with powerful underlying solvers and complex physics is leading to a new generation of capabilities with applications to a range of hydrogeological problems.

Indonesia recognizes Roman Catholicism as one of its six approved religions. The Holy See has a nunciature in Jakarta, while Indonesia has an embassy in Rome. History There have been relations between the Holy See and Indonesia since the era of the Majapahit empire. Between 1318–1330 CE, Mattiussi, a Franciscan friar, visited several places in today's Indonesia: Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. He was sent by the Pope to launch a mission into the lands of Mongols in the Asian interior. In his report, he described the marvelous palace of the Javanese King and the war with the Great Khan of China. It was the court of Majapahit king Jayanegara in Trowulan that was visited by Mattiussi. During the colonial era of the Dutch East Indies, some parts of Indonesia, such as Flores, were known as Catholic-majority areas. During colonial times, most Europeans residing in the Dutch East Indies were Protestants; however, the teachings of the Catholic Church began to spread there in the 19th century. In 1947, Vatican established an Apostolic Delegation in Indonesia (then Dutch East Indies) with a Dutch government permit. The Holy See recognized the Republic of Indonesia on 16 March 1950 and put an apostolic delegate in the country. Official relations between the Republic of Indonesia and Holy See were established in 1950, after independence from the Netherlands, with the status of Apostolic Internunciatur. http://nunciatureindonesia.org/vatican-indonesia-diplomatic- relations/ In December 1965, the status changed to Nunciatur Apostolic. There have been two papal visits to Indonesia: those of Pope Paul VI in December 1970, and of Pope John Paul II in October 1989. They both paid a courtesy visit to President Suharto. During his visit, Pope John Paul II celebrated a Mass and addressed a crowd of 130,000 Indonesian Catholics congregated in Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.

A key point of the plot of the movie happened in real life: a request was sent to the French Minister of Education to propose a Skirt Day.See Spring of Skirt and Respect. Plot Sonia Bergerac (Adjani), who favours wearing a skirt, teaches French literature at a middle school in a poor immigrant-dominated neighborhood. She increasingly resents the daily burden of racist and sexist abuse from her violent unmotivated students, even more so since the departure of her husband. Her wearing of a skirt is considered sensitive given the school's large Muslim population, many of whom consider such clothing immodest. During the rehearsal of a theatre play with one of her classes, she finds a gun in a student's bag. She struggles to grab the gun, and a shot is fired accidentally that injures the student's leg. Totally overwhelmed, she loses control and takes her class hostage, opportunistically creating a proper — although biased — teaching environment. While school, police and political authorities try to figure out what is going on and how to react, Sonia forces the students to see things her way and ultimately shows them the contradictions in their own lives. Most of them revolt against the macho bullies who abuse her and go over to her side. When the police ask what conditions she sets for releasing the class, she asks that the government declare a Skirt Day in schools each year, when females can appear in skirts. She also asks for journalists who will publicise her case in the media. The police then get her father to speak to her and, when he switches to Arabic from French, the students realise that, like many of them, Sonia is also of North African origin. When the journalists arrive, they are, in fact, policemen who fatally shoot her. At her funeral, the girl students all wear skirts.

Lilienfeld said that the lack of funding prevented a typical theatre release and prompted a prior broadcast on TV. The inaugural release covered 50 cinemas, but this number grew because of growing public interest.Skirt Day @ Arte The movie was controversial because of its theme, viewpoint and the hurdles that led to an atypical cinema and TV release. It is debated whether the movie is \\"politically incorrect\\", especially in light of the success of similarly themed movie Entre les mursEmmanuel Berretta, article dated Marth 23, 2009 in \\"Le Point\\" (site web) a few months earlier. It was nominated for Best Film at the 35th César Awards and Isabelle Adjani won a record fifth award for Best Actress. It was her first role in six years and considered to be a comeback for her.

In popular culture A key point of the plot happened in real life even before the theatrical release. As in the movie, some students in France sent a request to the Secretary of Education to propose that a Skirt Day be observed every year. The intent was to have the government issue a strong signal that it is legitimate for female teachers to dress with a skirt while teaching, instead of complying with ultra-conservative policies implicitly enforced by aggressive students.

History  Chaplains from Australia, Ireland and New Zealand together during the Gallipoli Campaign Historically, both Ireland and New Zealand were constitutionally linked when the United Kingdom formally established the Colony of New South Wales in 1788 which included most of present-day New Zealand. In 1840, New Zealand formally joined the British Empire after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The first major contact between both nations was during first wave of Irish immigration to New Zealand. Because the Irish were considered to be \\"British\\", it is unknown who the first Irish were to reach New Zealand, however, the first Irish migrants to reach New Zealand would have occurred around 1840 when the New Zealand Company first began assisting would-be migrants to settle in New Zealand.British & Irish immigration, 1840-1914 In comparison to Irish immigration to North America and Australia, very few Irish people migrated to New Zealand, mainly due to the cost of travel and the enormous distance between both nations.Irish Immigration to New Zealand Over the years, however, several waves of Irish people would migrate to New Zealand and as a result, approximately 18% of the population of New Zealand today can claim Irish descent. Both Irish and New Zealand soldiers fought side-by-side for the British Empire during the Second Boer War from 1899–1902 and World War I from 1914–1918, especially during the Gallipoli Campaign.New Zealand at War During the Easter Rising in 1916 and when Ireland declared its independence from the United Kingdom in 1919, many Irish-New Zealanders became involved in the Irish cause, however, their numbers were never great which may have been attributed to the fact that most of those with Irish origins in the country were already second generation New Zealanders with loose connections with Ireland. By 1947, New Zealand essentially became an independent nation after accepting the Statute of Westminster Adopting Act. Post-independence In May 1948, former Irish Taoiseach Éamon de Valera traveled to New Zealand seeking support for a united Ireland, but was not successful due to the fact that Ireland remained neutral during World War II whereas New Zealand fought under the Commonwealth in the war.A Policy of Futility: Eamon de Valera’s Anti-Partition Campaign, 1948-1951 Although New Zealand did not support a united Ireland, many New Zealanders still hold Ireland as an important contributor to their country both culturally and historically.

Before World War I, he was the foremost Slovene Marxist revisionist theoretician. After the War, he became one of the most persistent advocates of Slovenian autonomy within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and, together with Dragotin Lončar, the ideologist of the democratic reformist faction of Slovenian Social Democrats. In the late 1920s, he evolved towards agrarianism. He was also known under the pseudonym Abditus.  Life  He was born in a working-class family in Ljubljana, in what was then the Duchy of Carniola. Before World War One, he worked as a clerk of the Austro-Hungarian administration in various Carniolan towns. After the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the proclamation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, he became employed in the Slovenian Commission for Social Welfare, where he worked under the supervision of the Christian Socialist thinker Andrej Gosar. This was the only public political office he ever held in his life. After 1919, he worked as an editor in the prestigious Blasnik Publishing House, one of the oldest publishing houses in the Slovene Lands, dating to early 19th century. In 1920, he became its owner, renamed it to University Publishing House, and transformed it into one of the most prestigious academic publishing houses in Yugoslavia. In the mid-1920s, he also became an editor in the publishing house Slovenska matica, led by his friend Dragotin Lončar. He died in Ljubljana at the age of 56.  Political career  Already at a young age, Prepeluh became influenced by Marxist and autonomist ideas. In 1902, he corresponded with the German Marxist theoretician Karl Kautsky on the possibilities to activate the peasantry in favour of socialism. The same year, he founded the journal Naši zapiski ('Our Notes'), in which he propagated radical socialist reformism. The journal soon became the herald of young Slovene reformist Social Democrats, which included Anton Dermota, Dragotin Lončar, and Josip Ferfolja. In 1904, Prepeluh became a member of the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party. He soon entered in conflict with the party's mainstream. Prepeluh rejected the official Austromarxist orientation of the party, and soon entered in confrontation with the party leader Etbin Kristan. Differently from Kristan, Prepeluh endorsed the Bersteinian critique of Marx; he also supported the quest for territorial autonomy of the South Slav peoples against the official Social Democrat support for a purely cultural autonomy. During this time, Prepeluh became a close friend and collaborator of the Social democratic author Ivan Cankar. They both shared a similar personalist and autonomist vision of socialism, and they both opposed the gradual cultural and linguistic assimilation of all South Slavs, officially supported by the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party. After 1908, Prepeluh developed a friendly relationship with the Christian Social politician Janez Evangelist Krek, who unsuccessfully tried to persuade him to leave the Social Democratic Party and join the Slovene People's Party. Prepeluh remained in the Social Democratic Party, but in the following years he grew closer to Christianity. In 1910, he rose in defense of the \\"popular faith\\" against the prevailing Anti-Catholicism of Slovene liberals and social democrats, and criticised the prolongation of the Kulturkampf in the Slovene Lands. In 1917, Prepeluh became the leader of the internal opposition against the main current of the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party, which continued to put the social question before the issue of national emancipation. In 1918, with the creation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, Prepeluh rose to the leadership of the party. He was the leader of its right wing in a sharp confrontation against the left wing, represented by Dragotin Gustinčič, Anton Štebi and Rudolf Golouh. He was in favour of collaboration with the Democratic Party and supported the social- liberal coalition government of Ljubomir Davidović. After the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party, which was a preponderately Slovenian organization, merged with the Centrumaši and formed the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia in 1921, Prepeluh became marginalized. In 1920, he and Dragotin Lončar re-founded the journal Naši zapiski. They both opposed the centralist program of the new unified Yugoslav Socialist party, and called for a territorial autonomy of Slovenia within Yugoslavia. In 1921, he was one of the proponents of the influential Autonomist Declaration, in which the majority of the most important Slovene intellectuals voiced their support for Slovenian autonomy. In 1924, Prepeluh and Lončar founded the Slovenian Agrarian Labour Party, which soon merged with the small Slovenian Republican Party into the Slovenian Labour Agrarian Republican Party. The party established close connections with the Croatian Peasant Party. In 1926, it merged with the Independent Agrarian Party, into the Slovenian Peasant Party, of which Prepeluh became the main ideologist. After the party was dissolved with the establishment of the dictatorship of king Alexander I of Yugoslavia in 1929, Prepeluh retrieved from public life.  Work  Prepeluh wrote many political treatises. His first major work was Občina in socializem (The Commune and Socialism, 1903), in which he articulated an autonomist vision of socialism. Influenced by Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, he wrote the essay Problemi malega naroda (Problems of a Small Nation). In the book Idejni predhodniki današnjega socijalizma in komunizma (Ideological Precursors of Contemporary Socialism and Communism, 1925), he stressed the difference between the democratic and emancipatory versions of socialism and totalitarian Bolshevism. In Pripombe k naši prevratni dobi (Observations on Our Revolutionary Era), written shortly before his death and published posthumously in 1938, he reflected on the significance of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the creation of Yugoslavia, reasserting his belief in the Yugoslav project. He also wrote several historical works, among them Reformacija in socialni boji slovenskih kmetov (The Reformation and the Social Struggle of the Slovenian Peasants, 1908), and Kmetski pokret med Slovenci po prvi svetovni vojni (The Peasant Movement among the Slovenes after World War One, 1928). He also translated Machiavelli's The Prince into Slovene (published as Vladar).

Development and design In 1944, the Yakovlev UT-2 was the standard primary trainer of the Soviet Air Forces, but its simplicity caused problems when pilots moved on to more sophisticated aircraft, so the Yakovlev design bureau designed a more sophisticated derivative, the UT-2L, which featured an enclosed tandem cockpit, the addition of flaps and blind flying instruments.Gunston 1995, p. 459.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, pp. 56–57. At the same time, Yakovlev designed a single-seat aircraft based on the UT-2L, intended as a fighter-trainer. This aircraft, the Yak-5, was a low-wing monoplane of wooden construction, but unlike the UT-2, had the front cockpit removed and an enclosed sliding canopy placed over the rear cockpit. A retractable tailwheel undercarriage replaced the fixed landing gear of the UT-2. It was powered by a Shvetsov M-11D five-cylinder radial producing 115 hp (86 kW), which drove a two-bladed variable-pitch propeller. It could be fitted with a single synchronized ShKAS machine gun aimed by a reflector sight, while the aircraft was also fitted with a radio.Gunston and Gordon 1997, p. 91.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, p. 57. Operational history The prototype Yak-5 first flew on 7 September 1944.Gunston and Gordon 1997, p. 92. The new fighter- trainer's handling proved popular with its test pilots, and the aircraft successfully passed official evaluation. In the end, neither the UT-2L or the Yak-5 entered production because the Soviet Air Force command believed wooden aircraft were becoming obsolete, which would result in production of the all- metal Yakovlev Yak-18 trainer in late 1945. The sole Yak-5 was destroyed when it suffered failure of the wooden wing during a snap roll and crashed.Gunston 1995, p. 467.

Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, it combines fact and fiction to question fighter pilot Billy Bishop's accomplishments during World War I, featuring excerpts from John MacLachlan Gray's play Billy Bishop Goes to War. The film specifically questions accounts of Bishop's solo mission to attack a German aerodrome on June 2, 1917, for which he was awarded a Victoria Cross, and suggests the event was imaginary and that Bishop exaggerated his own accomplishments. In one particularly contentious scene, his mechanic claims that the damage to his fighter was confined to a small circle in a non- critical area, implying that Bishop had landed his aircraft off-field, shot the holes in it, and then flown home with claims of combat damage. In reality, his mechanic was his biggest supporter in this issue and the scene was entirely fictitious. The mechanic insisted that Bishop had not fabricated the damage. Reaction After years of controversy over Bishop's record, mainly because very few of his claimed victories were witnessed by anyone else or could be confirmed from surviving German records, the show led to an inquiry by the Canadian government in 1985. The Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology discredited the documentary, saying it was an unfair and inaccurate portrayal of Bishop. The NFB's Commissioner, François N. Macerola, was called before the committee, but refused to accede to their demands that he withdraw the film from circulation. Canadian veterans' groups were outraged by the insinuation, and Cowan received many irate letters, \\"He got inundated by thousands of furious letters, rumblings in the Senate subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, and demands that the government cut off funding to the NFB.\\" H. Clifford Chadderton, Chief Executive Officer of The War Amps, created the film The Billy Bishop Controversy to counter the bias he and other veterans perceived in the NFB film. Released in 1986, it attempts to demonstrate that Cowan and the NFB did not properly research the historical records, and reached faulty conclusions about Bishop. The Kid Who Couldn't Miss also led Chicago native, and Bishop fan, Albert Lowe to create a website (www.billybishop.net) devoted to the fighter pilot. Lowe complained about the characterization of Bishop in the film, and commented that \\"That year Mr. Paul Cowan, with $514,007.00 of Canadian Taxpayer's money, did one of the foulest deeds possible without committing some form of violence.\\" A Hero to Me: The Billy Bishop Story - WW1 Canadian flying Ace , a documentary depicting the story of \\"Billy\\" Bishop from the perspective of his granddaughter, Diana, was also produced for Global Television and TVO in 2003.

It was originally part of the Welsh Tract and is now a portion of the Bridlewild Trails Association. Early Times In 1698, Welsh farmer Robert Lloyd was deeded of land near \\"the road leading through the Black Rocks\\" now known as Black Rock Road. In 1700, Lloyd built a one room with loft house on the property, complete with beehive oven and walk-in fireplace for help with cooking. Over the next 14 years, Lloyd had eight kids and tended to the farm. However, in 1714, Robert Lloyd died. Lloyd's wife, Lowry Lloyd, soon remarried. Her new husband added a new portion to the house in 1717 and a wooden barn was built. The Farm changed hands a few times over the next century. Along with the change of ownership, the barn was rebuilt to stone in 1825, the two portions of the farmhouse were connected in 1825, and a wagon house was added (1827). Eventually the farm was bought by John Williamson (for whom Williamson Road, where the farm currently sits, is named.) He added a springhouse (1860) at the base of the hill, used both as a cool place to store food and a water source. Upon his death in 1864, the farm was partitioned between his two sons, Garret and Samuel Williamson. Garret sold his share back to Samuel, who over the next few years added a carriage house, milkhouse, bull pen, and horse stable. Saunders Times In 1897, Frances Saunders (wife of medical publisher Walter Saunders) bought what was Idylwild Farm from Samuel Williamson. She bought only 87 of the remaining of the farm. Around 1900, the farm was changed from a crop and horse farm to a dairy farm, using Ayrshire cows. Although they had a house in the Overbrook neighborhood of Philadelphia, the Saunders wanted a place to work and play during the summer months, for example, they dug a pool in 1924, which is still there today. Mrs. Saunders bought neighboring properties, increasing the size of the farm to , and tried to keep most of the buildings as original as possible. Although going deaf, she continued to work the farm until Walter deeded it over to his children, Lawrence and Emily, in 1927. Lawrence Saunders, who had married Dorothy Love in 1924, moved onto the farm and began to work the dairy produce. In 1927, Lawrence began the Bridlewild Trails Association on the property. He also formed in 1951 the Saunders Foundation to maintain a plot called Saunders Woods, which he had bought in 1922. In 1968, Lawrence Saunders died, leaving the farm to his estate. Dorothy Saunders, his widow, bought the farm from his estate, along with . She wrote poetry, worked the farm, and enjoyed farm life. A book of poetry, titled \\"Unbroken Time\\" was written at Idlewild and published in 1982. =Natural Lands Trust= In 1983 Idlewild Farm was entered on the National Register of Historic Places for Pennsylvania.

It premiered at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival, made its European debut at the 2006 Rome Film Festival and was released in North America on DVD/VOD by Breaking Glass Pictures. Plot summary Just Like the Son tells the story of Daniel Carter, a 20-year-old delinquent who unknowingly finds redemption by helping a six-year-old child, Boone, find a better life. After being sentenced to community service at a lower east-side grade school, Daniel strikes up an unlikely friendship with Boone, who shares his fear of becoming an orphan due to his mother's illness. When Daniel learns that Boone has an older sister living in Dallas, he begins to question the state system that would place a child in foster care rather than engaging in a search for a next-of-kin. Several days later, when Boone does not show up for school, Daniel decides to make it his business to track the boy down and right the societal crime he sees unfolding. After locating Boone in a temporary foster care facility in Upstate New York, Daniel is turned down as an adoption candidate. And when he fails to convince his Father to help him gain custody, Daniel decides to rescue Boone from the orphanage and seek out this long-lost sister on his own. Employing all his street smarts, Daniel grabs Boone and they head off to Dallas.

While most villages on Savai'i are situated near the sea, Patamea is situated inland, away from the coast. The village is in the Gaga'emauga political district near the central north coast of the island. Heading north west on the main road from Salelologa township and ferry terminal, the turnoff to Patamea is just before Samalae'ulu village at a T-junction of the road. Turning left (south west direction) at the junction is the road to Patamea, which lies 2 km from the main road. The road is tar sealed to the village. Geography The nearest villages to Patamea are Samalae'ulu and Mauga, a village built around the rim of a small volcanic crater. The main tar-sealed road circling Savai'i, which generally follows the coastline around the island where most villages are situated, runs inland where these settlements are located. The main road is considered a life-line for these inland villages for access to schools, churches and nearest hospitals at Tuasivi and Safotu. However, at Samalae'ulu village, the main road crosses a ford at Maliolio River which can become inaccessible during flooding. The river overflowing can also make access to plantations impassable along local roads which cross Molioli River in parts. Loss of access to plantations can have economic and health impacts on the villagers. In 2007, Patamea and neighbouring villages, came under a Coastal Infrastructure Management Plan by the Government of Samoa Coastal Infrastructure Management Plan, 2007 Draft, Government of Samoa. Retrieved 31 October 2009 to help communities prepare for any type of emergency. Under the plan, the government is responsible for public and district infrastructure while villages are responsible for implementing approved projects locally. Economy Like most villages in Samoa, the village of Patamea is based on a cash economy driven by traditional work, mostly in plantations although there is some cattle farming as well as family members working in the capital Apia on the main island Upolu. As the village is situated inland with no coast access, there is little fishing. In 2006, the Patamea Primary School committee received $245,000 Samoan tala, to rebuild the school, from the Japanese Government Grassroots Human Sector Grant Aid Programme.

This type of hearing aid is primarily suited for people who have mild to moderately severe hearing loss. This new hearing aid concept was invented by Adnan Shennib, founder of InSound Medical, Inc. The location of these aids directly in the ear canal can provide reduced distortion, wind noise, occlusion and feedback as well as better sound directionality and quality compared to other hearing aids. Use and operation Extended wear hearing aids are made of a soft material designed to contour to each user’s ear canal, with a range of canal width sizes to accommodate ear dimensions. An ENT physician, audiologist or hearing aid specialist non-surgically inserts the device into the ear, placing it in the bony portion of the ear canal ~4 mm from the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. The specific placement in the ear canal is said to provide an overall increase in gain and output, greater headroom, reduced occlusion effect, reduced feedback and improved directionality. Once inserted, users can change the volume and settings using a magnetic adjustment tool. It is recommended that a hearing specialist remove an extended wear hearing aid when the battery dies and the device needs to be replaced, but most hearing professionals provide patients with a removal loop tool to allow for self-removal should it be necessary. Suitability As with other hearing devices, compatibility is based on an individual’s hearing loss, ear size and shape, medical conditions, and lifestyle. This can be determined by visiting a hearing aid specialist. Durability Extended-wear hearing aids are built to withstand moisture and cerumen (ear wax) and can be worn while exercising, showering, etc. The longevity of extended wear hearing aids is affected by usage patterns, environmental differences, and the lifestyle of each user.

In 38 seasons (as of the end of the 2019 season), Anderson has led the Golden Gophers to a record of 1,317 wins, 887 losses and three ties. In the Big Ten he has led Golden Gophers to a record of 592 wins and 351 losses in that same span. Playing career Anderson graduated from Nashwauk-Keewatin High School in Nashwauk, Minnesota in 1973. Anderson would next enroll at the University of Minnesota, where he would walk-on to the Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball team. After pitching for two years, an arm injury forced Anderson to quit playing. He remained as a student coach for the next two years, and was even voted as MVP of the 1977 team. Coaching career Following his graduation in 1977, longtime Gophers coach Dick Siebert named him a graduate assistant. Siebert died in the winter of 1978, and successor George Thomas named Anderson a full-time assistant. Thomas resigned in 1981, and Anderson became head coach at the age of 26–at the time, the youngest head baseball coach in Big Ten history. He has spent his entire adult life at the U of M as a player, assistant coach or head coach. His most successful team was the 2018 unit, which reached the super regional round–the Gophers' deepest tournament run since their last College World Series appearance in 1977.

Perón, however, did not seek refuge there during the June 16, 1955, bombing of Plaza de Mayo by the Argentine Navy in an attempted coup, nor was he able to do so during his eventual overthrow, three months later.Page, Joseph.

The doctrine establishes whether a court should presume that parties to an agreement wish it to be enforceable at law, and it states that an agreement is legally enforceable only if the parties are deemed to have intended it to be a binding contract. Identifying intention to create legal relations A contract is a legally binding agreement. Once an offer has been accepted, there is an agreement, but not necessarily a contract. The element that converts any agreement into a true contract is \\"intention to create legal relations\\". There must be evidence that the parties intended the agreement to be subject to the law of contract. If evidence of intent is found, the agreement gives rise to legal obligations whereby any party in breach may be sued. In English law, there are two judicial devices to help a court to decide whether there is intent: the earlier objective test, and the later rebuttable presumption. Both tests are used together in combination. =The objective test= The reasonable man would deem that the promise of a reward was intended to be binding. Counterintuitively, the best way of discovering whether the parties intended to contract is not to ask them, as this \\"subjective test\\" would give the rogue an easy loophole to escape liability. (He would reply, \\"No! I did not intend to be bound\\".) Instead, just as in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company,Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1893] 1 QB 256 the court applies the \\"objective test\\" and asks whether the reasonable bystander, after taking into account all the circumstances of the case, thinks that the parties intended to be bound. Since the advertisement (pictured) stated that the company had \\"deposited £1,000 in the Alliance Bank to show sincerity in the matter\\", the court held that any objective bystander who read this would presume an intention to contract. =The rebuttable presumption= The rebuttable presumption establishes a burden of proof; but the burden may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary. The civil standard of proof is \\"a balance of probabilities\\", while the criminal standard of proof is \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\". Here, different presumptions will apply, according to the class of agreement. For these purposes, there are four classes of agreement: * Family agreements: a presumption of no contract * Social agreements (i.e. agreements between friends): no presumption (case decided on its merits, using the objective test) * Commercial agreements: a presumption of a valid contract * Collective agreements: a presumption of no contract The four classesFamily agreements= Family agreements are presumed not to give rise to legal relations unless there is clear evidence to the contrary. The courts will dismiss agreements which for policy reasons should not be legally enforceable.Koffman, Macdonald, p. 98 In 1919, Lord Atkin held in Balfour v BalfourBalfour v Balfour [1919] 2 KB 571 (where a husband promised his wife to pay maintenance while he worked in Ceylon) that there was no \\"intention to be legally bound\\", even though the wife was relying upon the payments. The judge stated that as a general rule, agreements between spouses would not be legally enforceable: In a more modern case, Jones v Padavatton,Jones v Padavatton [1969] 1 WLR 328 the court applied Balfour v Balfour and declared that a mother's promise to allow her daughter an allowance plus the use of a house provided that she left the USA to study for the English Bar was not an enforceable contract. However, if there is clear intent to be contractually bound, the presumption is rebutted. In Merritt v Merritt,Merritt v Merritt [1970] 2 All ER 760, [1970] 1 WLR 1211 a separation agreement between estranged spouses was enforceable. In Beswick v BeswickBeswick v Beswick [1967] AC 58 an uncle's agreement to sell a coal delivery business to his nephew was enforceable. Also, in Errington v Errington,Errington v Errington [1952] a father's promise to his son and daughter-in-law that they could live in (and ultimately own) a house if they paid off the balance of the mortgage, was an enforceable unilateral contract. =Social agreements= With social agreements, there is no presumption, and the case being decided solely on its merits. Although many sources consider \\"social and domestic agreements\\" to be a single class, it is better to regard \\"family agreements\\" as a class separate from \\"social agreements\\", as the latter invokes no presumption, and only the objective test applies. In Simpkins v Pays,Simpkins v Pays [1955] 1 WLR 975 an informal agreement between a grandmother, granddaughter and a lodger to share competition winnings was binding. Sellers J held, applying the objective test, that the facts showed a \\"mutuality\\" between the parties, adding: In Coward v MIB,Coward v M.I.B. [1962] 1 All ER 531 CA the Court of Appeal held that when a motorcyclist regularly gave a friend a pillion lift in return for some remuneration in cash or in-kind, there was no contract. Soon after, in Connell v MIB,Connell v M.I.B. [1969] 3 All ER 572 CA a case with materially similar facts, Lord Denning (violating the rule that the Court of Appeal was bound by its own decisions) said, \\"I am not satisfied by the decision in Coward. I think that when one person regularly gives a lift to another in return for money, there is a contract, albeit informal\\". In a similar \\"lifts for friends case\\", Albert v MIB,Albert v M.I.B. [1971] 2 All ER 1345 the House of Lords approved Denning's decision in Connell (so that Coward may be considered bad law). =Commercial agreements= Business transactions are presumed to be binding contracts. Business transactions incur a strong presumption of a valid contract: these agreements where the parties deal as though they were strangers, are presumed to be binding. However, \\"honour clauses\\" in \\"gentlemen's agreements\\" will be recognised as negating intention to create legal relations, as in Jones v Vernons PoolsJones v Vernons Pools [1938] 2 All ER 626 (where the clause \\"this agreement is binding in honour only\\" was effective). One must be careful not to draft a clause so as to attempt to exclude a court's jurisdiction, as the clause will be void, as in Baker v Jones.Baker v Jones [1954] 1 WLR 1005 If a contract has both an \\"honour clause\\" and a clause that attempts to exclude a court's jurisdiction (as in Rose & Frank v Crompton)Rose & Frank v Crompton [1925] AC 445 the court may apply the blue pencil rule, which strikes out the offending part. The court will then recognise the remainder, provided it still makes sense, and remains in accord with the parties' bargain. The offending clause was: When the words \\"and shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the Law Courts either of the United States or England,\\" are \\"blue-pencilled out\\", the remainder becomes legally acceptable, while staying true to the intended meaning. The party asserting an absence of legal relations must prove it; and any terms seeking to rebut the presumption must be clear and unambiguous.Furmston, Cheshire, Simpson, Fifoot, p. 150 Where in Edwards v Skyways LtdEdwards v Skyways Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 349 a bonus payment, described as 'ex gratia', was promised to an employee, this was found to be legally binding. He had relied upon the promise in accepting a redundancy package, and his employer could not adequately prove that they had not intended their promise to become a contractual term.Furmston, Cheshire, Simpson, Fifoot, p. 151 =Collective agreements= A collective agreement is a special type of commercial agreement, such as one negotiated through collective bargaining between management and trades unions. At common law, Ford v Amalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry Workers,Ford v A.U.E.F. [1969] 2 QB 303 the courts held that collective agreements were not binding. The Industrial Relations Act 1971, introduced by Robert Carr (employment minister in Edward Heath's cabinet), provided that collective agreements were binding, unless a contact clause in writing declared otherwise. After the demise of the Heath government, the law was reversed. The law is now contained in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 s.179: The civil law approach In civil law systems, the concept of intention to create legal relations is closely related to the \\"will theory\\" of contracts as espoused by German jurist Friedrich Carl von Savigny in his nineteenth century work System des heutigen Römischen Rechts.Savigny, System des heutigen Römischen Rechts (1840) online, in German It had been a prominent concept through the nineteenth century that contracts were based on a meeting of minds between two or more parties, and that their mutual consent to a bargain, or their intention to contract, were paramount. While it is generally true that courts wish to uphold the parties' intentions,BCCI v Ali and HIH v Chase Manhattan Bank courts moved in the later half of the nineteenth century to a more objective stance for interpretation,e.g. Smith v Hughes [1871] LR 6 QB 597 whereby the emphasis moved to the way in which the parties had manifested their consent to a bargain to the outside world. Given this change, it was still said that \\"intention to be legally bound\\" was a necessary element for a contract, but it came to reflect a policy about when to enforce agreements, as well as when not to.

Warburton played rugby for the Cardiff Blues and was first capped for Wales in 2009. He usually played as an openside flanker but was also capable of playing at blindside. In June 2011, he was named as Wales captain versus the Barbarians and subsequently in August 2011 he was named as the Wales captain for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In April 2013, he was named the Lions' captain for the 2013 tour to Australia, and was also named as captain for the 2017 tour to New Zealand. Warburton holds the record for the most Wales caps as captain (49). In July 2018, the Wales and British and Irish Lions captain announced his retirement from rugby union. Early and personal life Warburton was born in Wales to a Welsh mother and an English father and he considers himself Welsh and British. He has an older twin brother, Ben, who played at semi- professional level with Glamorgan Wanderers RFC and is now a physiotherapist for the Cardiff Blues, and an older sister Holly, a schoolteacher. Their great-grandfather, George Reed, was a professional footballer who played 150 times for Leeds United in the 1920s and 1930s. He attended Whitchurch High School and left with three A Levels. As a youngster he was a keen football player and played for his school team alongside schoolmate Real Madrid and Wales forward Gareth Bale. He had a trial with local club Cardiff City at the age of 14 but chose to concentrate on rugby instead. He played on the junior teams of Rhiwbina RFC and played for Glamorgan Wanderers RFC whilst a member of the Cardiff Blues Academy. On 5 July 2014, Warburton married long term partner Rachel Thomas in a church ceremony in Newport, before the couple held a reception at the Celtic Manor Resort. Career Warburton represented Wales at all levels, captaining the under-18s, under-19s and under-20s. He led Wales to the semi-finals of the World Championships at under-19 and under-20 level. Warburton made his debut for the senior Wales national team against the United States on 6 June 2009. On 18 January 2010, he was named in the 35-man Wales squad for the 2010 Six Nations. He scored his first international try against Italy in the 2011 Six Nations. Warburton captained Wales for the first time against the Barbarians on 4 June 2011 at the age of 22 years and 242 days becoming Wales' second youngest captain after Gareth Edwards. In a World Cup warm-up match against England, Warburton was named man of the match. In August 2011, he was named as captain for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand in the absence of the injured Matthew Rees. =2011 Rugby World Cup= In the opening match of the tournament against South Africa, Warburton became the youngest ever World Cup captain, facing experienced South African openside flanker Heinrich Brüssow. While Wales lost 17–16, Warburton won man of the match, forcing six turnovers and making nearly a quarter of Wales' tackles (23 out of 99). He continued his form in the match against Samoa, making a further six turnovers and 17 tackles as Wales won 17–10. Warburton played another good game against Namibia before being rested for the final half-hour in the 81–7 game. Wales then booked their place in the quarter-finals against Ireland with a 66–0 win over Fiji, in direct contrast to the loss of four years earlier. Warburton was again at the heart of the performance making some steals and some good runs, and also scoring his second test try. At the end of this remarkable few weeks, Warburton was then voted the Player of Pool D by the fans; he had taken the tournament by storm, making the highest number of turnovers. Wales then met Ireland in the quarter-final as Warburton faced the in-form Irish openside flanker Seán O'Brien, in the 'battle of the opensides'. Wales reached the semi-final for the first time in 24 years with a 22–10 win, as Warburton continued his form, making 21 tackles and a number of turnovers, disrupting Ireland's ball. In the semi-final against an out-of-form France, Warburton became the second Wales player to receive a red card in a World Cup when he was sent off after 18 minutes by the Irish referee Alain Rolland for a dangerous tackle on Vincent Clerc. Warburton admitted the offence at a disciplinary hearing in Auckland, and stated to the press that the decision was fair. However, he stated in his autobiography in 2019 that he actually considered that only a yellow card should have been awarded. Despite the sending off, the Guardian newspaper, Brynmor Williams and Sir Ian McGeechan, the Lions coach, named him player of the tournament. =2012 Six Nations= In spite of the return of former captain Matthew Rees, Warburton retained the Wales captaincy for the 2012 Six Nations. However, the campaign was disrupted by injury. In the opening match against Ireland, Warburton went off injured at half-time with a dead leg, but Wales managed to win 23–21. He missed the 27–13 win over Scotland but returned for the Triple Crown decider against England. Wales won 19–12. Warburton was at his best making steals, carries, taking lineouts, but it was his try-saving tackle on Manu Tuilagi that caught the eye. The England centre seemed destined to score in the corner but Warburton launched himself low and grabbed his ankles to make a superb try- saver.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/17168428 As a result, he was awarded man of the match. However, he sustained a knee injury and missed the 24–3 win over Italy. He returned for the Grand Slam decider against France but was once again injured, this time his shoulder and was taken off at half-time. Wales prevailed though 16–9 to claim a Grand Slam. Warburton would then lift the trophy with one hand, since his other shoulder was in a sling. He later spoke of his guilt at going off at half-time and asked vice-captains Gethin Jenkins and Ryan Jones to share the raising of the trophy, but the veterans said it was his moment. The injury he sustained would rule him out for six weeks, returning in time for the Lions tour of Australia in June 2013. =2015 Six Nations= Warburton surpassed the record of 33 caps as Wales captain held by Ryan Jones against Ireland on 14 March 2015. =British & Irish Lions= Warburton was named as captain of a 37-man squad for the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, making him the youngest ever Lions captain at the age of 24. Warburton was selected as captain in the first test in Brisbane, combining in the back row with Tom Croft and Jamie Heaslip. The Lions won 23–21 with Warburton topping the tackle count with 14. Warburton started the second test a week later. The Lions lost 16–15 and many considered the turning point to be when Warburton got injured and left the field. Warburton was magnificent at the breakdown preventing the Wallabies from having a platform.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/23111416 However, the hamstring injury he picked up in the second test meant Warburton was ruled out of the final, deciding test, with Alun Wyn Jones captaining the team to a 41–16 win and the Lions’ first series victory since 1997. After the match, Warburton and Jones raised the Tom Richards Cup together. In April 2017, Warburton was selected by Warren Gatland to captain the Lions for the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.

Blumenfield (born September 13, 1967) is an American elected official in Southern California. Blumenfield is the Los Angeles City Councilmember for the 3rd Council District which encompasses the southwestern San Fernando Valley neighborhoods of Los Angeles, including Canoga Park, Reseda, Tarzana, Winnetka, and Woodland Hills. Blumenfield took office on July 1, 2013. Blumenfield previously represented the 45th district in the California State Assembly, which also covers the southwestern San Fernando Valley. Prior to his election to the City Council, Blumenfield served in the California State Assembly from 2008 – 2013. He was the first Democratic freshman Assemblymember to ever serve as the Chair of the Budget Committee. During his four-year tenure as Chair, he led the State from the brink of economic insolvency to structural balance and surplus. He delivered his last three budgets on-time and balanced – a feat that hadn't been achieved during the prior 25 years. In addition, he radically changed the budget process to make it more transparent and accountable. Capitol Weekly called Blumenfield “a shining light” with a “reassuring amount of perspective that is uncommon among so many politicians.” He was extraordinarily prolific and effective in the Assembly, having had over 50 bills signed into law. He is considered an environmental and consumer champion and has won numerous accolades and was named “Legislator of the Year” from a diversity of groups which included, TechAmerica, Easter Seals, New Horizons, ONEgeneration, the California Chiropractic Association, the Los Angeles League of Conservation Voters and Californian's Against Waste. Planned Parenthood gave him both their prestigious “Champion for Choice” Award and their “Advocate for Access” Award. Early life and education Blumenfield was born on September 13, 1967. He is a graduate of Duke University and the UCLA Anderson School of Management. From 1989 – 1996, he worked in Washington, DC as a staff person to Senator Bill Bradley, Congressman Howard Berman and as staff designee to the House Budget Committee. He later worked as Director of Government Affairs for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and then as District Chief of Staff to Congressman Berman in the San Fernando Valley. In addition, he has served on numerous non-profit boards including the Anti-Defamation League, Children's Express, and the Los Angeles League of Conservation Voters. California State Assembly (2009-2013) Blumenfield took office as a member the California State Assembly in 2008 after defeating Republican candidate Armineh Chelebian in the general election.https://web.archive.org/web/20141130050219/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2008-general/index.htm During his time in the Assembly, Blumenfield represented the San Fernando Valley in District 40 and, following redistricting in 2012, District 45. He achieved a high rate of success in getting his bills enacted into law. In 2012, the Governor signed 18 of 19 bills authored by Blumenfield that year. A year earlier, he recorded a 92 percent success rate on his legislative package. He served as chair of the Assembly Budget Committee for four years and was the first freshman Democratic Assemblymember to be appointed to this position. While in the Legislature, Blumenfield authored more than 54 bills which have since been signed into state law. These bills not only stabilized the budget, but improved the environment, increased access to technology in schools, and form the foundation of his ongoing efforts to improve the quality of life in the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles. =The Budget= As chair of the Assembly Budget Committee, Bob oversaw the shaping of a state spending plan in 2013 that marked a new beginning for California's fiscal future. When he was sworn in as a freshman legislator in December 2008, the State faced a looming fiscal emergency and a state deficit of $40 billion. In the years that followed, Blumenfield would deliver three on-time balanced budgets—a feat not seen since the mid-1980s. Blumenfield delivered a spending blueprint that maintained fiscal responsibility, tracked the governor's conservative revenue estimates, paid down $5.2 billion in debt and established a rainy-day fund for emergencies. In November 2013, the Legislative Analyst's Office projected a $5.6 billion reserve, reflecting the hard work and tough choices made under Blumenfield's leadership. =Environmental legislation= Combating the drought, environmental sustainability, and promoting green business were central to Blumenfield's policy agenda. He authored AB 474, which established a voluntary system that allows public agencies and water districts to provide up-front financing for the installation of water use efficiency improvements. Two other measures authored by Blumenfield saved California State Parks from closure due to budget constraints and preserved parts of the Santa Monica Mountains. Blumenfield's AB2724 promoted solar power generation on state buildings to save an estimated $20 million. Another bill allows state colleges and universities to receive credit for all the power they generate on campus. Blumenfield also ensured that single-occupancy drivers of electric vehicles get free access to toll roads and carpool lanes through 2015. =The Economy= As a member of the California State Assembly, Blumenfield's economic priorities focused on green business, technology, small business, and infrastructure. Blumenfield helped lead a special task force of legislators who negotiated a plan to build a new NFL stadium in Los Angeles and expand the LA convention center to attract businesses to Downtown. In an effort to support green business, Blumenfield authored SB71 which established a sales tax exemption for equipment and products used in the manufacture of clean technology and green energy products. Blumenfield was also able to pass a constitutional amendment that would authorize a statewide ballot measure to lower the vote threshold for communities to approve bonds that pay for infrastructure projects. =The Valley= During his tenure in Sacramento, Blumenfield fought to ensure the Valley's fair share; working hard to preserve funding for public and charter schools in his district, stopping the proliferation of mobile billboards in the Valley, and establishing a local emergency earthquake preparedness team. When construction on the $125 million Valley Performing Arts Center was halted due to budget constraints, Blumenfield managed to secure funding to ensure the completion of the state of the art facility which ultimately opened in 2011. =Consumer protection= Blumenfield authored a number of bills that focused specifically on consumer rights and consumer protection, particularly to prevent exploitation of senior citizens and the disabled. With AB 589, Bob established the first protections in state law to help seniors and others against financial investment scams. He also passed AB 1293, which prohibits theft of financial assets from seniors and disabled individuals in the state of California. With AB 1268, Blumenfield combated unexpected charges by cell phone service providers by requiring them to inform customers when they have reached their allotted airtime of data usage for the month. He would later postpone moving his legislation as the Federal Communications Commission was simultaneously pursuing similar regulation. Blumenfield also authored the landmark bill AB 1215, which requires used car dealers to alert consumers about any junked, totaled, or salvaged vehicles. =Global affairs= Blumenfield has been outspoken on international affairs throughout his political career, particularly on issues dealing with Israel and the Middle East. He authored several bills aimed at divesting California state funds from Iran in response to their nuclear program. Among these was AB 1151, which divested California's public pension funds (CALPERS) from businesses with interests in Iran's energy sector. In 2011, Bob formally asked the California State University to resurrect its study abroad program in Israel. The program was suspended in 2002 after the US Department of State issued a “travel warning” for Israel in the wake of the Second Intifada. In 2010, Blumenfield passed AB 619, the Holocaust Survivor Responsibility Act, legislation that would require companies seeking contracts to build California's High Speed Rail system to disclose their involvement in deportations to Nazi concentration camps. It also created a $60 million fund to distribute reparations to thousands of Holocaust survivors and their families who were deported by France's state rail company SNCF during the Nazi occupation. In 2015, SNCF announced a settlement in excess of $60 million for its role in the deportation of an estimated 76,000 French Jews to Nazi concentration camps. Commenting on Blumenfield's role in achieving the landmark sanctions, Raphael Prober, a partner at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP and pro bono counsel to the survivors, remarked that “Bob Blumenfield has been a tremendous advocate for these Holocaust survivors in their quest for justice. Bob’s early support and leadership in the California Assembly represented a true turning point in the survivors’ decades-long efforts to hold SNCF accountable for its Holocaust-era atrocities. California set the stage for similar legislative efforts in numerous other states, sparking a surge of public support and momentum that I believe was invaluable in achieving the historic agreement now in place.” Blumenfield also authored AB 1032, which provided a framework to promote green technology research and development by companies in California and Israel. In November 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger appeared in Israel to sign an intent letter leading to a memorandum of understanding modeled on the bill. Blumenfield authored ACR 144, proclaiming every April as Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month to call attention to genocides throughout history, and to educate people about the need to speak out against contemporary and historic genocides. =Committees= 2013-2014 * Banking and Finance * Budget, Chair * Transportation * Water, Parks and Wildlife * Legislative Budget, Vice chair 2011-2012 * Appropriations * Budget, Chair * Governmental Organization * Legislative Budget, Vice chair * Transportation * Water, Parks and Wildlife 2009-2010 * Arts, Entertainment, Sports, Tourism, and Internet Media * Budget * Joint Legislative Budget * Transportation * Water, Parks and Wildlife LA City Council (2013–Present) Councilmember Bob Blumenfield was elected to the Los Angeles City Council in March, 2013. He represents the 3rd Council District, which spans the northwest portion of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley, including the communities of Canoga Park, Reseda, Tarzana, Winnetka and Woodland Hills. =Technology=CityLink LA Broadband Initiative A 2013 study by the Public Policy Institute of California showed that 35% of Angelenos lacked access to the internet or could not afford it.http://www.ppic.org/main/publication_show.asp?i=263 With an emerging tech sector in LA's Silicon Beach and an ever-growing demand for high-speed internet in the LA area, Blumenfield, with support from Mayor Eric Garcetti, began exploring options to expand a citywide broadband network. The goal of this initiative was to ensure that every citizen has access to the internet and that ISPs would support net neutrality. Blumenfield spearheaded an effort to identify one or more providers to commit to deploying advanced wireline and wireless networks that could provide one gigabit broadband speeds to all residences and businesses in the city of Los Angeles. CityLink LA will also give all Angelenos access to free Wi-Fi at slower speeds.http://blumenfield.lacity.org/pressrelease_061015 In a public \\"Request for Participants,\\" the City is currently seeking start-ups and private companies to submit proposals that show potential implementations of a broadband plan.http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2013/13-0953_misc_06-04-2015.pdf Unlike in other municipal level broadband projects, the City of Los Angeles would not pay to build a Wi-Fi or fiber-optic infrastructure. Instead, CityLinkLA would see private companies footing the bill of building a broadband network. OurCycle LA Blumenfield joined with Mayor Eric Garcetti and Council President Herb Wesson to launch OurCycleLA, a new City of Los Angeles program to refurbish City computers slated for replacement and give them to Angelenos in need. Computers not suitable for refurbishment are recycled by a local e-waste social enterprise company committed to providing job training to previously incarcerated Angelenos who face barriers to employment. OurCycleLA grew out of a motion introduced last year by Wesson and Blumenfield, in response to news that thousands of City computers would need to be replaced following Microsoft's decision to halt support for machines running Windows XP. As part of a March, 2015 pilot program, The City collected approximately 10,000 old computers from all city departments to jump start the OurCycle LA program. Of those, approximately 3,000 computers were determined to be refurbishable and are being fully retooled and loaded with software including Microsoft Windows 7, MS Office, and a web browser before being distributed to non-profit partners and families in need.http://www.lamayor.org/mayor_garcetti_launches_ourcycle_la_to_give_refurbished_city_computers_to_underserved_angelenos =Economic development=Minimum wage increase When Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced in 2014 that he would be asking the City Council to raise the minimum wage, Blumenfield expressed support for the initiative. During drafting of the ordinance, he was influential in crafting legislative changes to address impacts of any minimum wage increase to non-profits and small businesses, and how the City would monitor and adapt to changes in the local economy resulting from the increase.http://blumenfield.lacity.org/raise_the_wage_and_get_it_right Blumenfield would go on to vote in support of the $15 minimum wage.https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-minimum-wage- hike-20150518-story.html#page=1 Reseda Rising In 2014, Blumenfield unveiled a plan, dubbed \\"Reseda Rising,\\" to revitalize the Reseda neighborhood of Los Angeles by promoting local businesses. At its launch, the program focused on multiple economic development initiatives, including leveraging previously untapped resources to boost investment in the area. =Budget= As a member of the Council's Budget and Finance Committee, Blumenfield worked to craft a sustainable budget that is reflective of budget priorities for the West Valley. These include increased funding for public safety and other critical services such as sidewalk repair and tree trimming. =Infrastructure=Seismic retrofitting, cell towers, and PACE Blumenfield introduced a proposal to strengthen the City's communications infrastructure by ensuring that cellular communications towers are built to withstand vigorous shaking during an earthquake. The measure requires future towers be built to an Importance Factor of 1.5—the same standard currently required by public safety facilities in Los Angeles. Ensuring that communication can continue uninterrupted is central to emergency response and rebuilding efforts. Blumenfield also put forward concrete steps to include Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing programs as an option for soft-first story retrofits. PACE is a state-run program that assists property owners to finance upgrades by paying them off through their property taxes. The PACE program explicitly allows for earthquake retrofits.http://blumenfield.lacity.org/pressrelease_021315 Parks, streets, and more A recent settlement agreement relative to the Class action lawsuit Willits v. City of Los Angeles has been negotiated and obligates the City to expend approximately $31 million a year for 30 years to repair Los Angeles’ broken sidewalks. Blumenfield is working to craft a plan to repair LA's sidewalks in an affordable and sustainable way. Blumenfield is a longtime supporter of efforts to revitalize the LA river. Blumenfield has been among the most vocal advocates of the River as a critical recreation and economic resource, and played a key role in lobbying the White House and Congress to approve Alternative 20, a plan to restore 719 acres of river habitat in Los Angeles. Approved by a unanimous vote, the Warner Center 2035 Plan is a blueprint for future specific plans based on principles of sustainability, community connectedness, accessible public transit and the promotion of innovative businesses and jobs. It is intended to stimulate job growth and economic development by using a transit-oriented development approach to support the regional transportation investment of the existing Metro Orange Line. Since taking office, Councilmember Blumenfield has actively pushed to incorporate new green building design standards into the plan, including LEED silver or equivalent and green roof or cool roof requirements for new construction. Warner Center provides more than 40,000 jobs in the City of Los Angeles. In 2013 Farmer's Insurance announced that they would move their headquarters to Warner Center, and it is the home to major entertainment and healthcare firms, as well as extensive retail opportunities. =Global affairs= Councilmember Blumenfield has been an outspoken supporter of Israel since his time as an Assemblymember. He has led multiple initiatives for closer collaboration with Israel. LA-Israel Taskforce Blumenfield convened the Los Angeles-Eilat Innovation and Cooperation Task Force at the Milken Global Conference, the annual symposium that brings together some of the world's leading experts in financial markets, industry sectors, health, government and education. The task force was created to facilitate the exchange of ideas and innovation between Israeli companies, education communities and non-profits and their counterparts in the City of Los Angeles. It was established following the 2012 signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU), based on legislation Blumenfield authored as an Assemblymember, to strengthen trade, research and economic development ties between California and the State of Israel. =Environmental policy=Combating the drought City Council backed a measure authored by Councilmembers Bob Blumenfield and José Huizar that would develop a strategy to improve the energy and water efficiency of Los Angeles's largest users.http://blumenfield.lacity.org/pressrelease_120314 As part of his ongoing work to “green the Valley,” Councilmember Bob Blumenfield broke ground on the Blumenfield Water-Wise Demonstration Garden at the West Valley Municipal Center in Reseda. Blumenfield began discussions on how best to reduce the Municipal Center's water footprint shortly after taking office in July 2013. Mayor Eric Garcetti recently announced an expansion of California friendly landscaping at City facilities as part of his recent executive order that seeks to cut citywide water usage by 20%.http://blumenfield.lacity.org/pressrelease_112414 =Committees= * Trade, Commerce, and Technology Committee, Chair * Energy and Environment Committee, Vice-Chair * Budget and Finance Committee * Arts, Parks, and River Committee Prior to Council reorganization on July 1, 2015, Blumenfield served as the Chair of the Innovation, Technology, and General Services Committee, as well as a member of the Council's Audits Committee.

From 1804 to 1808 he studied at the University of Landshut, where he was a pupil of Philipp Franz von Walther (1782–1849). He spent the next few years on an extended educational journey throughout Europe, where he studied with Alexis Boyer (1757–1833) in Paris, Antonio Scarpa (1752–1832) in Pavia and Georg Joseph Beer (1763–1821) in Vienna. Afterwards he was second physician at the general hospital in Munich. In 1816 he was appointed professor of surgery and Oberwundarzt in the Juliusspital at the University of Würzburg. In 1832 he was relieved of his duties at Würzburg and banished to the surgical school at Landshut because of suspicion of political ties to the July Revolution and the Hambach Festival. In 1834 he was reinstated at Würzburg, where he remained for the rest of his career. One of his better known students was Bernhard Heine (1800–1846), inventor of the osteotome. In the field of surgery, Cajetan von Textor was a specialist of bone and joint operations. Among his publications was a German translation of Alexis Boyer's surgical work titled Grundzüge zur Lehre der chirurgischen Operationen (1818–1827, 2nd edition 1834–1841).

An annotated edition with a number of small textual corrections appeared in both material and digital formats in 2009.  Summary  The poem narrates the life of a white Jamaican, Adam Cole, born sometime in the 1930s and so growing up during World War II, during which his uncle Johann, of German extraction, is interned in the same camp as future national leader Alexander Bustamante. Adam has a close friend, Nathan, a poor black boy who is a gardener and groom, but education forces them apart. After taking a degree at Oxford University in the 1950s Adam returns to Jamaica to work as a journalist on the Daily Tribune (a version of The Daily Gleaner) and marries a Jamaican Chinese, Amber Lee. They have a daughter, Chantal, but when she is 15 (sometime in the early 1970s) she is raped in the grounds of her school, and the marriage subsequently breaks up, Amber and Chantal emigrating to Canada while Adam stays in Kingston and becomes ever more committed to crusading journalism. A parallel historical narrative charts Jamaica's progress from Crown Colony to full independence, and its subsequent descent into serious civil violence. Corruption, veniality, sectarianism, and other elements forming what Rastafarians call the 'politricks' of Jamaica are noted, but the principal force for evil is squarely diagnosed as the international cocaine trade, in its facilitation of material corruption, in the morally deadening toleration of violence it promotes, and in the appalling opportunity cost it imposes on national infrastructure, education, and business. From this history a series of vignettes emerge, of profits turned, of a needless death on the operating table caused by a substandard generator, of extrajudicial killing by a special police squad, and of events in the life of a principal cocaine baron—Adam's sometime friend, Nathan. Eventually an enforcer named Blaka, spurred by religious conversion, becomes an informer for Adam, whose journalism begins to expose too many secrets of the 'runnings', or details of shipments and transactions. Adam also hears the dying confession of a white middleman, Tony 'the Frog' Blake, who knows of Nathan's involvement, and so becomes an unacceptable threat to the cocaine trader—and as Blaka observes, \\"Blood / cheaper than drugs\\" (946-7). Blaka is found murdered on Mount Diablo (a central Jamaican height), \\"stuffed in a handcart, head severed, torso turned / to the mountain, blank eyes staring down the valley [...] the word Judas, warning intaglio, / carved with a switchblade into the transom\\" (955-9); another body is floating in the harbour; and Adam himself is confronted at home, and after a brief struggle shot dead, by Nathan. Formally, View from Mount Diablo uses a tragic (i.e. failed, abortive) Bildungsroman structure to support a state-of-the-nation novel; additional topoi and tropes concerning the drug trades and policing are drawn both from real Jamaican life and from popular cinematic and print fictions of crime. Technically, the verse novel is written in loosely heroic single-rhymed quatrains—i.e. the metre consistently approximates iambic pentameter, and the four-line stanzas rhyme abcb. It is structured in a prologue and 12 chapters, and has 1,048 lines.  The treatment of time and autobiography  Given Adam's apparent dates of birth and marriage, and Chantal's age when raped, it is easy to suppose View from Mount Diablo to cover Jamaican history from the 1930s-70s. Similarly, given that Adam is a white Jamaican protagonist created by a white Jamaican author, it is easy to suppose him autobiographical. But neither supposition is adequately true. Jamaican history from the 1930s-70s certainly is covered, but while those ought to be the limiting dates a series of devices and observations blurs the issue, and forces time to be more advanced than it chronologically should be. In gross, the scale of the cocaine trade reported and the annual murder-rates implicit in it point to a date in at least the later 1980s, while in fine, references to computerisation in journalism and the use of a personal photo as a screensaver implies a date at least in the 1990s. What Thompson in effect manages is to keep the first half of his story in historical time, but thereafter to subsume into the violence and social problems of the 1970s all later, generically similar events of the 1980s-2000s, so that in the second half of the story time is foreshortened, and the verse novel made much wider-reaching as a contemporary national diagnosis than it may at first seem. In keeping, while Adam's childhood and racial identity are similar to Thompson's, his Oxford degree, profession of journalism, experience of familial tragedy, and murder in early middle-age progressively distance him from his creator.  Origins and early reception  Thompson has said that a significant factor in his decision to write View from Mount Diablo was pressurising encouragement from Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott, a longstanding personal friend: > On one of his visits to Jamaica Derek Walcott said to me, \\"Thompson, every > time I come to Jamaica I feel your anger about the state of politics in > Jamaica and the corruption contaminating the society. Why don't you reflect > this indignation in your next collection[?]\\" [...] The first step was to > recognize that the anger which Walcott recognized needed to be regulated by > a relatively strict poetic form or it would turn into a scream.Ralph C. > Thompson, 'In My Own Words', at Geoffrey Philp's Blog Spot, 4 Feb. 2009. The poem won the Jamaican National Literary Award in manuscript in 2001; the Award Committee that year was chaired by David Williams, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Literatures in English at the University of the West Indies–Mona, where the poem has subsequently been taught. Initial sales in Jamaica amounted to 300+ copies (average sale of a paperback being c.70View from Mount Diablo: An annotated edition (Tirril: Humanities-Ebooks, 2009), p. 36.). It was serialised in The Gleaner (Kingston) and published in paperback by Peepal Tree Press in 2003 to strongly positive and appreciative reviews; two such are reproduced in the second, annotated edition (2009), and half-a-dozen are linked through the Peepal Tree website.

In 2004, Soapnet began repeating the series, and all episodes have been released on DVD. Season one: 1992-1993 During its first season, Melrose Place was an earnest serial drama with low-key storylines focusing on young people who come to Los Angeles to realize their dreams. The series was introduced with a crossover story from Beverly Hills, 90210 in which Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) pursues Melrose Place resident Jake Hanson (Grant Show), a laborer and bad-boy biker. Jake appeared in the last two episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210s the second season, and Kelly appeared in the first three episodes of Melrose Place; Jake breaks off the romance because of their age difference and his inability to commit to her. Tori Spelling appears in the first two episodes as her Beverly Hills, 90210 character Donna Martin; Brian Austin Green appears in the first three as David Silver, and Ian Ziering appears as Steve Sanders. Michael (Thomas Calabro) and Jane Mancini (Josie Bissett) are the building's stable couple. Michael (the building superintendent) is a physician at Wilshire Memorial Hospital, and Jane is a budding fashion designer. Their neighbors are roommates Alison Parker (Courtney Thorne-Smith) and Billy Campbell (Andrew Shue). Alison is a receptionist at a local advertising firm, and Billy is a struggling writer who makes ends meet as a dance teacher, a taxi driver, a local newspaper reporter and a furniture salesman before finding a job at Escapade magazine near the end of the season. Alison and Billy later began an affair. Gay social worker Matt Fielding (Doug Savant) files a sexual-discrimination lawsuit against the halfway house at which he volunteers. Other original cast members are aerobics instructor Rhonda Blair (Vanessa A. Williams) and her roommate, Sandy Louise Harling (Amy Locane), who moonlights as a waitress at Shooters (the group's hangout). Sandy was written out of the series after 13 episodes and Rhonda left after the first season, when she becomes engaged to wealthy restaurateur Terrence Haggard (John Marshall Jones). Early in the series, photographer Jo Reynolds (Daphne Zuniga) arrives from New York to escape her alcoholic ex-husband. Jo and Jake become friends and enjoy an on-again, off-again romance. Faced with mediocre ratings, its producers attempted to revamp the series during this season. Heather Locklear appeared as Amanda Woodward, the art director at D & D Advertising who became Alison's confidante. Intended as a guest star, Locklear remained on the series throughout its run. Amanda became vice-president, having affairs with several Melrose Place residents and vying with Alison for Billy's affections. The series evolved from an episodic format to a soap opera with ongoing, interwoven stories, beginning with Michael Mancini's affair with co- worker Kimberly Shaw (Marcia Cross) and Alison's affair with a married man who begins stalking her in the season finale after she ends the relationship. The season ends with Alison and Billy becoming a couple, Michael and Jane splitting up when Jane discovers his affair with Kimberly, and Amanda's miscarriage of Billy's baby and her purchase of the building because of the love triangle made up of her, Billy and Alison. Season two: 1993-1994 As the second season began Jane divorced Michael, who would become engaged to Kimberly and have a fling with Jane's younger sister Sydney (Laura Leighton), a prostitute and stripper. While waitressing at Shooters Sydney is introduced by a co-worker to Lauren Ethridge (Kristian Alfonso), a Hollywood madam who recruited Sydney into her call girl ring. Although Sydney quits, she is arrested for solicitation. Michael bails her out of jail, blackmailing her to break up Jane and her latest love interest: her divorce lawyer, Robert Wilson (Steven Eckholdt). A drunken Michael crashes his car (apparently fatally injuring Kimberly), but escapes manslaughter charges when Matt alters his blood-alcohol test results at the hospital. Sydney uses this knowledge to blackmail Michael into marrying her, despite Jane's objections. Her plans are foiled when Kimberly reappears alive and well, saying that her mother lied about her death to keep Michael away. Kimberly is more ruthless and unstable as a result of brain surgery and the accident. She reclaims Michael, revealing her desire to kill him; removing her wig in front of a mirror, a gruesome scar from the accident is seen. Sydney takes over Lauren Ethridge's call-girl ring while Lauren is in jail. When Lauren is released, she demands the profits from her escort service while she was incarcerated. Sydney works as a stripper and a prostitute to raise the money. She is attacked on the street by other prostitutes; in the hospital, Kimberly recruits her for her scheme to kill Michael. Early in the season Matt loses his job when the halfway house closes, and Michael finds him a job in the social-services department of Wilshire Memorial. He befriends a Russian doctor, Katya Petrova (Beata Pozniak). Katya is attracted to Matt, who tells her he is gay. When she is in danger of deportation, he offers to marry her so her five-year-old daughter Nikki (Mara Wilson) can remain in the U.S. However, Matt's \\"marriage\\" now hampers his love life. When Katya returns to Russia to visit her family she decides to stay and sends for her daughter, freeing an emotional Matt from their arrangement. He becomes romantically involved with Jeffrey Lindley (Jason Beghe), a closeted U.S. Navy officer, although he disagrees with Jeffrey's secrecy. Although Matt persuades Jeffrey to come out, he regrets it when Jeffrey is discharged from the service and leaves town. Jake buys a struggling motorcycle-repair shop, which soon burns down in a fire accidentally started by Amanda. Jake never discovers that Amanda is indirectly responsible for the fire, and ends his romance with Jo. Jake becomes romantically involved with Amanda, whose father Palmer Woodward (Wayne Tippit) offers him a job as a mechanic. He learns that Palmer is involved in a scheme to sell reproduced cars as originals, and is forced by the FBI to help it arrest Palmer. Jo becomes romantically involved with her former high-school flame, ex-convict Reed Carter (James Wilder), who smuggles drugs on boats he works on. When she discovers his stash, he kidnaps and tortures her on the boat in the Pacific Ocean. Jo kills Reed in self- defense, later learning that she is pregnant with his child. Alison and Billy's romance has its ups and downs. She has a relationship with Steve McMillian (Parker Stevenson), a new client at D & D Advertising after Amanda becomes senior vice-president. Although Alison tries to set up Jo with Steve, Steve leaves to work in Europe and Alison and Billy reconcile. Billy rises through the ranks at Escapade, moving to New York to work. This strains his relationship with Alison, and he returns to Los Angeles to propose to her. Struggling in her romance with Jake and running D & D Advertising, Amanda has an uncomfortable reunion with her estranged mother Hilary Michaels (Linda Gray). Hilary is CEO of Models Inc., which would spawn a spinoff series. Jo meets Sarah Owens (Cassidy Rae), a model at Hilary’s agency, whom she helps end an abusive relationship. Hilary asks Amanda to employ her fiancé, Chas (Jeff Kaake), at D & D and Amanda fires him after he harasses her sexually. However, Chas files a sexual-harassment lawsuit against Amanda and her company. Hilary learns the truth about Chas, testifying against him and ending the case in Amanda's favor. However, Amanda cannot forgive her mother and Hilary returns to the modeling agency. Alison and Billy become engaged, and plan a wedding in the building's courtyard. On her wedding day, when her father hugs her she experiences flashbacks of his molesting her as a child. Alison flees through a window and goes to San Francisco to see her sister, Meredith, who was also abused by their father. The season ends with Kimberly (in a short blonde wig) running Michael down in Jane's car, followed by Jane's arrest. Notes: *The scene in which Matt and Rob kissed in the season finale was edited in the wake of a possible advertiser boycott. Darren Star says to Variety: \\"We filmed it. The network had the final cut. It was a kiss too far from their point of view. It was a place they didn’t want to go. Twenty years ago, it was verboten. When you watch \\"I Love Lucy,\\" two married characters were not allowed to share a bed. Network TV has always been archaic and frightened about showing sexuality. That’s always been their biggest taboo. They’ve caught up a lot. It has to stay somewhat relevant to the audience that watches it\\". *Linda Gray (Hillary) and Cassidy Rae (Sarah) were cast members on the Melrose Place spin-off Models Inc. They appeared in five episodes of Melrose Place to introduce their characters to the public. *Second season finale on May 18, 1994 was ranked #18. This is the best rating performance in all show history. *Darren Star and Aaron Spelling's favorite Melrose moment is \\"The Bitch is Back\\"'s ending scene (2.28), when Kimberly removes her wig to reveal a nasty scar on the side of her head. They introduce the clip on the documentary \\"Love Thy Neighbor: The Baddest and the Best of Melrose Place\\" (1995). Season three: 1994-1995 Jane and Sydney are blamed for Michael's hit-and-run accident, which leaves him with amnesia. Although he regains his memory (and realizes that Kimberly is his attempted murderer), they reconcile and marry in Las Vegas. Jo is embroiled in a custody battle with the Carters (Reed's parents), who want to take their (yet unborn) grandchild away from the woman who \\"murdered\\" their son. Although Kimberly seems to help Jo by faking the baby's death so Jo can escape with her son, she steals the baby because she cannot have children of her own. When Jo reports Kimberly and Michael to Wilshire Hospital chief of staff Peter Burns (Jack Wagner), Michael returns the child. Kimberly tells the Carters that Jo's baby is alive, and they hire a nanny to steal the baby. After Jo is shot in the back while tracking them down, she decides to surrender her son for adoption. Matt briefly reunites with Jeffrey, who tells him that he was discharged from the Navy when he tested HIV-positive. Matt is uncomfortable with Jeffrey's lust for life, and they break up. He becomes involved with married, closeted plastic surgeon Paul Graham (David Beecroft), who murders his wife in the season finale and frames Matt. Unable to exonerate herself for Michael's attempted murder, Sydney became an outcast from this point onward for the rest of the series. After her imprisonment, Jane had her committed to a mental hospital before employing her in a work-release program. Sydney is sexually harassed by Chris Marchette, Jane's sociopathic Australian business associate. After embezzling most of the funds from Jane's business, Chris fled the country after losing the stolen money gambling in Las Vegas (with Sydney his hostage). Sydney returns to waitressing at Shooters and grows closer to Jake. However, their relationship disintegrates when Jake learns that Sydney slept with Chris to protect him from an attack by an associate. When Sydney advertises for a roommate to help pay the rent, Rikki (Traci Lords) moves in. A conniving sociopath, Rikki convinces the Melrose residents that Sydney is destroying their possessions and encourages her to join a cult led by Martin Abbott (Remy Zada). When Sydney tries to leave the cult, she is kidnapped and Jane and Jake free her. Jealous of their romance, Sydney reverts to her devious self and breaks them up and avenges herself on Michael and Kimberly by extortion (using the money to control Jane's design business). Although Jane fights back, her business goes into foreclosure and she joins MacKenzie Hart Designs—where she becomes involved with co-owner Richard Hart (Patrick Muldoon). Jake buys Reed Carter's boat but it is destroyed when Amanda's fugitive father (Palmer) returns and hired a contract killer, named Brittany (Kathy Ireland), to murder Jake for making him lose his business. Brittany, however, plans to kill Palmer and escape with his money and Jake. When Jake refuses to go along Brittany blows up the boat, apparently killing him. However, Jake jumped overboard and is rescued. He buys Shooters with a $50,000 FBI reward for his help in the Palmer Woodward case (leading to the off-screen arrest of Brittany and the recovery of Palmer's money). Jake reconciles with Jo and reunites with his auto- mechanic half-brother, Jess (Dan Cortese), when their mother dies in their hometown. Jess follows Jake to Los Angeles, getting involved with Jo and arranging for Jake to be shot in an armed robbery at Shooters so Jess could take over Jake's business. Although Jo did not believe Jake that Jess arranged the shooting, when she asks Jess how he could afford an engagement ring when he proposes to her he attacks her. When Jake learns about the attack in the season finale he and Jess fight, falling off the edge of a high platform at a construction site. Alison's reluctance to marry Billy after the revelation about her father leads to Billy ending the relationship as Alison becomes an alcoholic. Since he still cares for her, Billy arranges for Alison to enter rehab and begins working at D & D copywriter. Amanda becomes involved with Wilshire Memorial chief of staff Peter Burns, who helps her take over D & D by buying stock. When D & D president Bruce Teller (Stanley Kamel) is ousted he commits suicide, and Amanda replaces him. Peter conspires to remove Amanda in favor of his old girlfriend, Caitlin (Jasmine Guy); he engineers a fake appendicitis attack and tries to kill Amanda on the operating table, when Michael rescues her and he is arrested. Amanda discovers that she has lymphoma, and is replaced at D & D by Alison. However, Alison could not cope with the sudden responsibliy and workload and she quickly became aggressive, ruthless, heartless and assertive just like Amanda. While treating her, Michael begins to fall for Amanda and they have a brief affair (enraging Kimberly). Amanda ends the affair when she recovers, teaming up with the conniving intern Brooke Armstrong (Kristin Davis) to reclaim D & D. Brooke becomes involved with Billy, and sends Alison to Hong Kong on business. After helping Amanda force Alison from D & D, Brooke begins plotting to take over the company. She marries Billy in the season finale, when Alison interrupts the ceremony to beg Billy for another chance. After she is sued for divorce, Kimberly frames Michael for assaulting her. He is bailed out by Peter Burns (who got out of prison for Amanda's attempted murder), who needs his and Kimberly's help to retain his medical license. Peter seduces Kimberly so she will testify in his favor, but his appeal is unsuccessful. Realizing that Peter used her, and hallucinating, Kimberly plants four firebombs in the apartment complex. Notes: *Melrose Place moves from Wednesday night to Monday night on FOX. There was a memorable ad campaign: the words \\"Mondays are a bitch\\" on Amanda's face (photo here:). *Former porn star Traci Lords appeared in a five episodes arc. Darren Star remembers: \\"Mostly, she looked like someone who actually lived in L.A. at that age... She had that quality. Like she could recruit you into a cult.\\" *Showrunners regret giving Amanda cancer. Darren Star says: \\"I remember having to tread carefully. Hodgkin’s is a serious illness. It wasn’t much fun.\\"\\" * Due to the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing (one month before the episode), the bombing did not appear onscreen in the U.S. until the beginning of season four. *Third season finale on May 22, 1995 was ranked #20. Season four: 1995-1996 Kimberly sets off a series of explosions which destroy half the Melrose apartment complex. Surprisingly, only Jane's potential new boss (Richard Hart's ex-wife Mackenzie Hart) is killed, and Alison is temporarily blinded. Peter and Michael join in a private practice, Mancini-Burns, at Wilshire Hospital. Jess' death in the fall at the construction site leaves Jake plagued by guilt. He sleeps with Shelly Hanson (Hudson Leick), Jess' ex-wife (in town for his funeral), and hires her at Shooters. She plans to ruin Jake financially as revenge for what she sees as Jake killing her ex-husband. Jake sees the light after she tries to murder him, and she is arrested. Matt is exonerated of Paul's wife's murder when Paul makes a deathbed confession after he is shot by the police. But Matt's boss, Calvin Hobbs (Francis McCarthy)—the Wilshire chief-of-staff who replaced Peter—fires him anyway for his inappropriate relationship with Paul. Matt wins another sexual discrimination lawsuit after his attorney goads Hobbs into making homophobic statements in court. Matt uses the settlement to enroll in medical school, and works at Wilshire Hospital as an intern. Kimberly is declared legally insane after the bombing and institutionalized. Peter cares for her, telling Sydney that his concern stems from the memory of his late sister (who had similar mental problems). Kimberly says she was encouraged in violence by a man named Henry; her mother recalls Henry, the family gardener whom Kimberly stabbed to death as a child when he tried to rape her mother. Kimberly is released to Peter, but is lonely when he begins to rekindle his romance with Amanda. Her eyesight regained, Alison returns to D & D Advertising and marries Brooke's father, Hayley (Perry King); Brooke and Hayley interfere with each other's marriages. Discovering he is financially ruined, during a trip with Alison, Hayley drowns in a drunken fall from his yacht. Brooke and Billy's marriage is rocky due to her jealousy, dishonesty and cruelty. They reconcile after Brooke's suicide attempt, but Billy leaves her for good. A drunken Brooke slips, hits her head on the edge of the Melrose Place pool and drowns. Haunted by her death, Billy tries to keep her memory alive. Soon, he resorts to unethical decisions while at D&D;, including sleeping with clients, though later realizes the error of his ways. Amanda admits faking her death years ago in Miami to escape her violent husband, Jack Parezi (Antonio Sabato Jr.)—a businessman with Mafia connections—who tracks her to L.A. and dies in an accident. She ends her relationship with Peter when she is reunited with her long-lost first love, Jack's brother Bobby (John Enos III). Peter gets involved with Alycia Barnett (Anne-Marie Johnson), Matt's lawyer in the Paul Graham case, and they conspire to ruin Bobby so Alycia can control his cable-TV empire; Peter hopes to win Amanda back. When Bobby discovers the plot, he attacks Alycia at Peter's office and she accidentally knocks him out the high-rise window to his death. Peter is arrested for the death, and Alycia dies in a car accident when she tries to leave town. Kimberly and Michael remarry, but she develops multiple-personality disorder and often reverts to a violent 1950s housewife named Betsy Jones. When she drives with Peter to the police station to provide his alibi for Bobby's death, Kimberly (as Betsy) instead commits him to a mental institution to avenge his declaring her insane. Jo gets involved with Richard Hart after breaking up with Jake, creating a rift between her and Jane. Jane pretends to seduce Michael to make Richard jealous; this infuriates Sydney, who spikes Jane's drink with prescription pills which cause a paralyzing stroke. Jake begins a relationship with Jane as she recovered, but after Richard rapes her during a business trip to New York she breaks up with Jake in her determination to harm Richard. Matt, in medical school classes and interning at Wilshire, begins a romance with closeted film actor Alan Ross (Lonnie Schuyler). Alan lies publicly about his sexual orientation, fearing that revealing his homosexuality would blacklist him in Hollywood. Behind Alan's back Matt begins a short-lived relationship with David (Rob Youngblood), who took his old social-services job at Wilshire Hospital, but feels guilty about cheating on Alan. He breaks up with Alan after he enters a lavender marriage with co-star Valerie Madison (Jeri Ryan) as a publicity move. When Matt contracts meningitis from a patient he becomes addicted to painkillers, stealing pills from the hospital's stores. Jo begins a relationship with Matt's medical-school professor Dominick O'Malley (Brad Johnson), who helps her care for Matt and deal with Sydney's school friend in a spousal-abuse case. When Dominick invites her to join him in Bosnia as part of a Doctors Without Borders program, she hesitates at first but eventually agrees. Amanda and Michael try to rescue Peter from \\"Betsy\\" at the mental institution. Kimberly returns to reality before falling from a scaffold; comatose, she leaves Peter again in jail with no alibi for Bobby's murder. Although Billy asks Jake to help reunite him with Alison, Jake and Alison begin a relationship of their own. In the season finale, Jane discovers that Sydney is responsible for her stroke and blackmails her into helping her murder Richard. Sydney apparently kills Richard with a shovel, and the sisters bury him in a field. In the final scene, however, Richard's hand pops out of the ground while Jane and Sydney speed off in their car.

Jane and Sydney are concerned that the truth will emerge about what happened to Richard, who harasses and threatens the sisters (who do not know that he is alive). Jake and Alison begin an affair behind Billy's back. Kimberly couldn't remember her dinner with Peter, and his trial was only a few days away. Two characters are introduced: Taylor McBride (Lisa Rinna) and her husband Kyle (Rob Estes), a Boston restaurateur. Learning of Peter's arrest, Taylor goes to Los Angeles for answers, rents Jo's vacant apartment and persuades Kyle to move their restaurant to L.A.

Taylor tells Peter that she is Taylor Davis, younger sister of his late wife Beth. Amanda begins to lose Peter as his interest in Taylor increases. Another new character, Megan Lewis (Kelly Rutherford), meets Michael when he runs on the beach. They begin an affair, since Kimberly has been ordered by her psychiatrist not to have sex. When he learns that Megan is a prostitute, Michael wants to be the only man in her life. Amanda meets a co-worker, Craig Field (David Charvet), whose father (Michael Des Barres) is her boss. Craig learns that he inherited the company from his mother, and harasses Amanda. His father dies of a heart attack after Amanda learns that he was involved in Craig's grandfather's murder. Michael finds Megan and Kimberly talking, and learns that Kimberly hired Megan to sleep with him. Michael makes Megan give up prostitution (assuring her that he will pay her living expenses), and Kimberly learns that she has a brain tumor and three months to live. Jane discovers that she was adopted and meets her mother, Sherri (Donna Mills). After she is robbed, Jane leaves her apartment and business to Sydney and visits her family in Chicago. Alison learns that she is pregnant with Jake's baby. Ambivalent about the pregnancy, she returns to D & D and has a miscarriage which leaves her infertile. Despite this, they marry. Matt's drug use becomes known and he enters rehab, beginning a relationship with director Dan Hathaway (Greg Evigan). Dan is domineering and physically abusive, and Matt leaves him after Peter threatens to have Dan fired if he does not address his behavioral problems. Taylor and Kyle's marriage is troubled, and Kyle has a one-night stand with Sydney. Sydney is in a relationship with millionaire Carter Gallavan (Chad Lowe), which ends when he learns about her attraction to Kyle. A con artist fakes an accident at Sydney's store and, left penniless after a trial, she becomes a con artist herself. Michael and Kimberly divorce as she coaxes him towards Megan. After Kimberly tells Megan she is planning suicide, she and Michael are injured in a car accident. Although Michael has a dream where Megan pulls him into heaven as Kimberly pulls him into hell, he promises Kimberly he will spend his last days with her and they reconcile. Billy and Samantha begin a relationship after her fling with Craig. After they move in together, her father (who has escaped from prison) appears, demands money from them and takes off; the police tap their phone.

Duke Vincent * executive producers Frank South =Summary= The season marks the departures of Andrew Shue, Brooke Langton, Lisa Rinna, Alyssa Milano and Linden Ashby (6.34). At the beginning of the sixth season, the show's ratings steadily fell. During most of the first half of the season, Heather Locklear's pregnancy was hidden from viewers with most of Amanda's scenes showing her from the chest up or hidden by props. The day after Sydney's death Craig blames Samantha, but he later apologizes. In the season opener, Michael recommends Matt for a job at an AIDS clinic and Matt moves to San Francisco with his niece Chelsea. Before leaving, he says that he wanted to say goodbye to everyone but \\"nobody's home\\". Two new characters are violent, vindictive Dr. Brett \\"Coop\\" Cooper (Linden Ashby) and his seductive ex-wife, snobbish heiress Lexi Sterling (Jamie Luner). The season focuses on Kyle and Amanda's troubled relationship; Amanda returns to her nasty ways after starting her own agency, Amanda Woodward Advertising. With Jake Hanson gone after selling Shooters, Kyle (backed by Amanda) opens the Upstairs Jazz Club and the bar becomes the group's new hangout. Amanda and Kyle's ex-wife, Taylor, continue their rivalry over him. Kyle ignores warnings from Jennifer, Michael and Taylor that Amanda is untrustworthy and incapable of love. Amanda's mentor from a New York advertising agency, Eric Baines (Jeffrey Nordling), arrives in Los Angeles for a visit and tries to seduce her. When Amanda spurns his advances, Eric purchases the building with Kyle's restaurant and the jazz club to shut them down. Amanda then agrees to Eric's proposition, keeping it a secret. When Kyle finds out, he attacks Eric and threatens to kill him; Eric then returns their property and leaves town. However, Kyle is angry with Amanda for keeping Eric's proposition a secret and agreeing to it. Billy and Samantha become engaged, and he asks Craig to be his best man. The couple have a falling-out after Samantha's old friend, Connie (Megan Ward), arrives in town. Although they reconcile and marry, Billy soon cheats on Samantha with Jennifer. Despite the affair, Billy is committed to making his marriage work. Samantha begins an affair with Jeff Baylor (Dan Gauthier), a minor-league baseball player. Jennifer tries to attract Craig, who is grieving for Sydney, and he agrees to a physical relationship. Craig enters a business partnership with Michael for a mechanical surgical glove, an idea Michael stole from Cooper. Michael betrays Craig, using Jennifer to break up with him so Michael could dissolve the partnership and keep all the profits. Craig attacks Jennifer after Michael ruins him, but she is helped by Billy after Billy destroys Craig's new advertising company. Craig escapes, steals Jennifer's car and commits suicide. Peter ends his romance with Taylor after learning that she cooperated with Michael to trick him into thinking he had epilepsy and unseat him at chief of staff at Wilshire Hospital. Taylor tries to win Kyle back, pretending to be pregnant with his baby and asking Michael to impregnate her to make her story believable. She becomes pregnant, has a change of heart and tries to attract Michael, her baby's father. Kyle is confronted with the return of Christine, his former Gulf War partner who was reported missing in action (and presumed dead) in Iraq, and Amanda is jealous of their friendship. When Christine attempts suicide before Kyle and Amanda's wedding, he abandons Amanda to save her. It is later revealed that Christine is not actually Christine, but she is actually Tiffany Hart (Susan Walters), a woman who Nick hired to pretend to be Christine (telling Kyle she had reconstructive surgery). In the psychiatric ward of Wilshire Hospital Tiffany is manipulated by Nick (another war buddy of Kyle's) and the jealous Taylor. After \\"Christine\\" sends another suicide letter to Amanda, Amanda visits her and threatens to kill her. Tiffany (as Christine) escapes from the hospital to find Kyle and Amanda and tell them the truth about Nick and Taylor. However, Nick runs Tiffany into Kyle's car, accidentally killing her, and he and Taylor bring her dead body to a railway line. After their wedding Kyle and Amanda receive a desperate letter from \\"Christine\\", and rush to the railway to rescue her. They are too late; she is \\"killed\\" by a train. Amanda, guilty about Tiffany/Christine's \\"suicide\\", breaks up with Kyle. When she marries evil businessman Rory Blake (Anthony Tyler Quinn), Kyle ruins the ceremony after discovering that the woman he saw killed by a train was actually a swindler. Taylor and Nick had manipulated the fake Christine into working for them; the real Christine had been killed by a bomb in Iraq. After Rory tries to kill Amanda for her money, Kyle kills him in self-defense and they remarry. Peter begins a romance with Cooper's ex-wife, Lexi, who asks for his help getting more alimony from her ex-husband (who had a brief affair with Kimberly Shaw when she was recovering in Ohio years earlier). Lexi is addicted to antidepressants, and Peter saves her from a lethal overdose. Her father, who disapproves of her relationship with Peter, dies of a stroke during an argument with him. Blaming Peter, Lexi breaks up with him and reconciles with Cooper (who tries to help her run her late father's business). Cooper forces Lexi to remarry him, ostensibly to protect her from prosecution for her late father's business deals but also to kill her and get her father's money. Michael faces off with Cooper, who tried to ruin his life because of Kimberly's death. Megan divorces Michael over his manipulation in unseating Peter as the hospital's chief-of-staff and begins a relationship with Cooper. Fired from the hospital, Michael opens a clinic in a poor Los Angeles neighborhood and avenges Megan and Cooper by ruining their plans to move to Philadelphia. He reconciles with Peter after saving his life when they were fishing, regaining part of the Burns-Mancini practice and his job at Wilshire. Michael attends his high-school reunion and reunites with Jane, his first wife, who followed him to Melrose Place. Samantha and Jeff try to break up Billy and Jennifer by sending a fake fax from Alison in Atlanta, which breaks Jennifer's heart because she thinks he still cares about her. Samantha, Jennifer, Billy, Taylor and Coop leave by the end of the season. In the season finale, Taylor gives birth to Michael's son (Michael Junior McBride) and agrees to share motherhood with the returning Jane. She then reconsiders, returning to Boston to raise the baby alone. After Coop's attempt on Lexi's life on a fishing boat, he leaves town to take a job with a man who had tried to con Megan into sex. =Note= * Only Thomas Calabro and Andrew Shue are original cast members to remain.

Matt, who had moved away a year earlier, is revealed to have died in a car crash on his way to a reunion dinner at Kyle's restaurant. He kept a coveted journal of all the secrets the residents shared with him. After her sham remarriage to Cooper, Lexi apologizes to Peter for blaming him for her father's death and they reconcile. However, Peter realizes that he still cares for Amanda and Lexi dumps him again, and this time for good. Lexi then launches a campaign against Amanda, buying the Melrose Place building from her and opening a new advertising agency, Sterling-Conway Advertising, which drives her out of business. Amanda and Eve Cleary were high-school cheerleaders in Dallas, Texas. An ugly encounter ended in the death of Eve's boyfriend and her 15-year imprisonment. Kyle learns about their past, agreeing to keep it from Peter (Eve's new husband). When Kyle and Amanda try to conceive Peter accidentally gives him the wrong test results, indicating that he is sterile. Kyle descends into alcoholism; Amanda is depressed by his behavior, until they reconcile after Kyle finishes rehab. Although Amanda agrees to sell the building to buy their dream home, their marriage ends. Josie Bissett returned to the series as Jane in 1998, and plotlines centered on her rekindling relationship with Michael. She slept with a client of Amanda's the day before her wedding to Michael, leading to his distrust of her as they decide to marry again. After exchanging vows again, they are estranged and on the road to divorce within hours. They have a brief reunion at Christmas. Megan and Ryan begin a relationship, marrying in the series finale. Jane joins Kyle (the actors were married in real life) and Amanda joins Peter (despite his marriage to Eve). Lexi becomes sexually involved with Michael, but they break up after she rejects his proposal (realizing that they cannot be faithful to each other). By early 1999, Fox decided to cancel the show due to falling ratings and high production costs. In the final episode, Amanda and Peter face mounting scrutiny; he is investigated for embezzling from the hospital, and she learns that Amanda (not Eve) killed her boyfriend 15 years ago. When they flee the country their hideout explodes, apparently killing them both. Eve cracks at their memorial service, throws Peter's ashes on Lexi and is jailed. Michael becomes Wilshire Hospital's chief-of-staff. Kyle and Jane discover that she is having Michael's baby, and an anonymous envelope appears containing Amanda's locket. At the end of the series finale Amanda and Peter marry on a tropical beach, rejoicing at their success in faking their deaths and paying Michael a million dollars in hush money. In the final scene, they walk along the beach to \\"Closing Time.\\" =Notes= *Thomas Calabro and Josie Bissett are the only original cast member to appear in season seven. *Thomas Calabro appeared in the most episodes of Melrose Place, 222, sixteen more than Heather Locklear (206) and twenty-four more than Andrew Shue (198). *On January 31, 1999, FOX announces Melrose Place cancellation.

Carr (April 30, 1873 – June 21, 1954), a founding father of functionalist psychology, was renowned for a methodical and thorough approach to his science. His work was largely devoted to studies of animal cognition and perception. Carr collaborated with John B. Watson on his most well-known project: the famous Kerplunk experiment. Carr held his post as chairman of the Psychology department at the University of Chicago from 1926-1938. He also served as the president of the American Psychological Association in 1926. BackgroundEarly life= Harvey A. Carr was born in Morris, Illinois on April 30, 1873 to Hamilton Carr and Bell Garden. He decided that psychology was not the route for him and chose to become a science teacher at the University of Harvard instead. Notably, he was not given the middle initial \\"A\\" at birth but instead chose it for himself later in life to round out his signature. Carr was a tall, slim man with a quick wit and a reserved, humble presence. His parents were free-thinkers who encouraged their son to make his own decisions about religion, education, and career. Carr states in his autobiography that the local community \\"firmly believed in the value of book learning—in so far as its acquisition did not interfere with the serious pursuits of life.\\" With a thirst for knowledge even in these early years, Carr supplemented the teachings provided in his high school and taught himself physics, algebra, and chemistry from textbooks. Though college education was not typical or expected in the community, Carr was driven to learn more. At the age of 18, Carr became a student of DePauw University's preparatory department. He was able to complete a three-year course in two years by taking extra classes and performing extra work in a district school. Carr entered college after completing prep school, and chose to remain at DePauw. Though he had not yet developed specific vocational goals, he felt that the opportunity to learn and sample several subjects was a valuable privilege. Carr opted to major in mathematics, which he found stimulating and absorbing. As his later research in psychology is marked by precision and objectivity, it is perhaps unsurprising that he was taken with mathematics in his early college days. Carr himself admits that this passion likely influenced his approach. He continued in this pursuit until he began to study differential equations; the difficulty of the subject made him doubt his mathematical prowess. Carr took up the study of history, which developed into a lifelong interest. He considered both physics and biology while seeking a new major, though both subjects were poorly supported by the university and the latter was considered to be taboo by the \\"authorities.\\" The nature of biological study and basis in evolutionary theory were frowned upon in the distinctly religious university. Carr felt repressed by DePauw's religious stance against evolution, and became distrustful of those who would oppose scientific study. Still, he made respectable grades in all of his various subjects and had little concern about his future vocation. At this time, he considered a possible future in law, and decided that it would be best to work and save up prior to attending law school. However, in his third year of college, a serious illness and financial pressures forced him to take leave and Carr returned home to recover for the rest of the year. The following year he spent working the farm and building back up his physical strength. Around this time, farmers in the area suffered some hardships, and Carr took up a job teaching in a country school close by in order to afford to return to school. He was familiar to the people of this area, and respected for his college education. The admiration motivated him to take his teaching duties seriously in order to fulfill the community's expectations of him. Carr had no prior education in educating, and quickly learned that the task required serious skill and experimentation in technique. He cited McMurray's Method of the Recitation as one of his main resources in learning this craft, which heavily impacted his later mentorship of his own graduate students. He found he enjoyed this work and taught with charisma and care in order to get the best from his students. When Carr was ready to return to his own scholarship, he decided to opt for a change of scenery and chose to attend the University of Colorado in 1899. With his bachelor's degree completed, he decided to stay and pursued a Master's. The relocation was just what he needed, and the university provided him with fresh ideas and stimulation. At this time, he intended to try once again to major in mathematics. He felt discouraged by the instructor's unfavorable personality, however, and Carr felt compelled to study instead under another professor with whom he had made a connection. This professor taught Psychology and Education, and Carr identified similarities between these subjects and his own background and interests in teaching. Of psychology, Carr admittedly knew little. He decided to take a minor in history, and relished the opportunity to develop scientific skill in this field. In his words, \\"Perhaps science must be defined in terms of its spirit and method and not on the basis of the subject matter.\\" Psychological studyExperimental experience= The University of Colorado provided a unique first experience in the field of psychology. His instructor, Arthur Allin, was fond of G. Stanley Hall's style of mentorship, and provided Carr with an enthusiastic and paternal hand in development. While such a style was criticized elsewhere, Carr respected both Allin's and Hall's influences. Though the university had no psychology lab, Allin encouraged Carr to become invested in experimental psychology. Allin himself cared little for apparatus and machinery, but saw the expanding interest in experimental work and predicted growth in that area of the discipline. Unfortunately, the lack of equipment meant that apparatus were improvised altogether and never produced success in their research. The following year, 1902, Carr was given a fellowship as a grad student at the University of Chicago to study experimental psychology. Carr began to work closely with Dewey, Angell, and Watson, and he shared a great friendship with the latter two. When he first saw the lab, he was shocked by the tiny building, which was heavily worn and falling apart; Carr considered it to be \\"unfit for human habitation.\\" Regardless, Carr took up collaboration with Watson in the lab and began his work in space perception. Perception, spatial reasoning, maze navigation, and animal cognition remained Carr's primary interests for years to come. In 1905, Carr defended his dissertation: A visual illusion of motion during eye closure.\\" Following his doctoral defense, Carr spent a few years teaching at several schools, strengthening his skill. He taught psychology for two years at Pratt Institute, where he met his wife, Antoinette Cox. The two later had three children together. =Development of ideology= Carr returned to Chicago in 1907 and worked with Watson on the Kerplunk experiment. While the study gained fame, Carr was saddened when Watson's recognition called him away from Chicago and earned him a place at Johns Hopkins. Carr took charge of animal studies at Chicago in 1908, and continued the line of work they'd been developing. He published on a wide range of subjects, though his work was always characterized by a careful, skeptical and controlled approach. His publications also matured as he did, moving from specific topics in experimental psychology to more broad constructs. Carr focused increasingly on concepts like learning, consciousness, and the mind. He was known to question ideas which were being taken for granted by others. He cautiously examined curves of forgetting, limens, plateaus, range of attention, and memory. Carr's interest in Functionalism deepened, influenced by GF Stout, GH Mead, and the colleagues with whom he had worked closely. In Carr's version of Functionalism, which he called the \\"American psychology,\\" adaptation and learning effects are emphasized. He found psychology to be defined by mental activity. While he was known to be open to new ideas, he was hesitant to accept Watson's Behaviorism, especially as it opposed his ideas of Mentalism. He found himself to be \\"somewhat of a behaviorist in the field of animal psychology\\" but did not accept the approach in human psychology. In his autobiography, Carr admitted that he wished he could see the future psychology of 1990, though he feared it would be woefully disappointing. =Influence= Functionalism and the University of Chicago's psychology program grew tremendously under Carr's influence. He went from his position as assistant professor all the way to chairman of the department, where he held his position from 1926-1938. During these years, he supervised graduate students with theses in various areas of psychology. He stated that 131 degrees were touched by his influence, 53 of those being doctoral dissertations under his direct supervision. He was involved in many psychological committees, and held positions as editor for the Journal of Experimental Psychology and the Journal of General Psychology. His writings, of which there are over 50, are influential and varied. He authored two books entitled Psychology, a Study of Mental Activity (1925) and An Introduction to Visual Space Perception (1935). He became president of the APA in 1927, giving an address entitled, Interpretation of the animal mind. He held a similar position in the Midwestern Psychological Association in 1937. In 1938, Carr became professor emeritus. In the years following his retirement, Carr devoted his energy primarily to students in the department rather than on publishing. References *Carr, H.A.

Federal, state and other public aid to migrant farmworkers has become increasingly restrictive, and in many cases, not available at all. The goal of the Harvest of Hope Foundation is to fill in the gaps in service to this most hard-working and deserving, yet needy group of laborers. History Although the Harvest of Hope Foundation is currently based out of Gainesville, Florida, it was founded by Philip Kellerman in 1997 in Oneonta, New York. The foundation was established through an inheritance from Kellerman's grandmother, Dr. Helen Zand (1901–1995)- the first female accepted to the law school of Cornell University and a long time social worker and advocate for the indigent. In honor and memory of his grandmother, Kellerman wanted to continue the tradition of social service work by forming the foundation in order to assist mobile field laborers of fruits, vegetables and other foods. There is a significance to the organization's name. In the field of migrant education, the words “harvesting” and “harvesting hope” are used frequently for those who advocate for the educational, social and health needs of migrant workers.Interview with Phil Kellerman 6/22/09 Organization The Harvest of Hope Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) foundation which is tax exempt as defined under the IRS guidelines. It is composed of a board of directors with over 100 combined years in migrant education and human services. =Board= *Phil Kellerman, President, Gainesville, Florida. Kellerman began his work with migrant farmworkers when he became employed with the Eastern Stream Center of Resources and Training (ESCORT) in 1989 at the State University of New York at Oneonta in Oneonta. ESCORT is involved in providing technical assistance to states, regions, school districts and schools serving children of migrant farmworkers. In 1995, Kellerman was the first staff person at ESCORT who responded to calls in English and Spanish on the National Migrant Education Hotline. However, funds to manage the hotline could not be used to provide emergency financial aid to callers for such things as transportation repairs, housing, utilities and funeral expenses. Thus, in 1997, Kellerman established the Harvest of Hope Foundation to provide financial assistance to hotline callers and other migrant farmworkers and families. *Tom Romero, Vice President, Gainesville, FL. Romero began his dedicated involvement with the foundation in 2005 by volunteering his talented digital art design and website programming services to help support migrant farmworkers and further the mission of the Harvest of Hope Foundation. Motivated to expand the foundation's internet presence and digital outreach, Tom is always adapting and refining our internet presence which now includes social media awareness outreach to thousands of donors and supporters nationwide. Consistent and reliable, Tom offers day to day support with various functional everyday operations within the foundation. His duties also include promotional strategies; partnered network coordination; team building, marketing strategies; fundraising strategies; enhancing donor outreach; help generate awareness about our cause; provide print/web graphic designs; and serves as the Foundation's liaison to the St. johns County Tourism Development Council for the annual charity fundraiser Harvest of Hope Fest at the St. Johns County Fairgrounds in St. Augustine, Florida. Tom is a native Floridian from Jacksonville Beach who graduated from Santa Fe College in Gainesville, Florida. He holds an A.A. in Business Management and A.S. in Graphic Design Technologies. Now residing as a Gainesville, Tom is deeply connected to the cause of migrant farmworkers due to his eye opening experiences and long-term commitment to his partner and her extended immigrant Mexican family. Through them he has become keenly aware of the adversities they faced during their immigration to the United States and the hardships they encountered to have the life that they now cherish. *Dina Sevayega, Treasurer, Latham, New York. Sevayega was born the child of Hispanic migrant farmworkers in Texas, and thus has lived the migrant experience in full. She overcame many moves and disruptions to her education as a youth to obtain her doctorate. She is currently an Associate in Higher Education/Teacher Education in the New York State Education Department. For four years, Sevayega has been involved in a service learning project at the State University of New York at Oneonta, where she shares her migrant experiences with students preparing to be teachers and who organize activities to raise funds for the Harvest of Hope Foundation. *Ed Kellerman, Communications Director, Gainesville, Florida. Since 1992, Kellerman has been a senior lecturer in the Dial Center for Written and Oral Communication at the University of Florida. His specialty is intercultural communication and organizational leadership. Kellerman also serves as the communications director for the foundation. He was a Peace Corps volunteer who worked as a speech therapist in Malaysia.Interview with Ed Kellerman 6/3/09 *DigitalGreg, Public Relations Specialist, Plantation, Florida. Working in various areas of public relations since he was 16, DigitalGreg chose public relations as his major at the University of Florida. During his senior year, while working toward his bachelor’s degree, DigitalGreg was asked by Ed Kellerman to join the Harvest of Hope Foundation as a public relations intern. The internship which started in January 2009 lead to his promotion as the foundation's public relations specialist. Prior to working for the Harvest of Hope Foundation, DigitalGreg worked in Broward County, Florida for the Hazmat Crew and Lexicon Productions promoting raves. He also was the special events leader for over three years while working for the City of Plantation, Florida. He helped plan an average of 18 events per year.Interview with DigitalGreg 7/12/2009 Mission The Harvest of Hope Foundation's mission is to provide humanitarian support and emergency financial assistance to migrant farmworkers and their families. It is the goal of the Harvest of Hope Foundation to fill in the gaps by providing basic humanitarian services to hard-working, yet needy migrant farmworkers.http://www.shineglobal.org/?p=654 The foundation provides migrant farmworkers and their families with emergency funding and assistance for automobile breakdowns, utility shutoffs, rent payments, medical situations and funeral expenses. The Harvest of Hope Foundation also issues grants to small businesses and organizations that provide social services and assistance to migrant farmworkers. The Harvest of Hope Foundation provides educational scholarships to children of migrant farmworkers to attend college or other post-secondary education. The Foundation also houses and manages 42 funds on behalf of migrant farmworkers and families.http://mutinypr.com/harvest_of_hope.php The Harvest of Hope Foundation works closely with teachers, social workers and advocates of migrant workers to coordinate the services and the distribution of financial aid. The Foundation President, Philip Kellerman conducts regular meetings and workshops throughout the country with educators, migrant advocates and state officials who are involved with social services to migrants.Interview with Tom Romero 6/19/09 The Harvest of Hope Foundation accepts monetary donations as well as donations of antiques, collectibles and memorabilia to sell to raise funds. Harvest of Hope welcomes individuals to organize and conduct fund- raising events. As of May 2010, the Harvest of Hope Foundation has distributed more than $812,000 in emergency and educational aid to migrant farmworkers and families across the country. Services The Harvest of Hope Foundation works to: *Support migrant farmworkers and their families with emergency aid *Issue small grants to programs that assist migrant families *Provides financial aid to migrant students attending college and other post-secondary educational institutions *Heighten awareness of the plight of migrant farmworkers in the country *Coordinate with agencies assisting migrant families and their children with education, social services and medical needs The Harvest of Hope Foundation now houses 42 funds to provide financial aid to select migrant farmworkers or to designated geographic regions. Housing: Often it is difficult for migrant farmworkers to find housing or to pay rent. When they are in need of emergency housing or could use help with late rent, the Harvest of Hope Foundation assists financially in order to help the migrants secure safe housing for themselves and their families. Transportation: If a migrant worker experiences a breakdown in their only form of transportation, the Harvest of Hope Foundation will help in paying for repairs. The organization also gives aid in the form of gas money, bus tickets and raises funds to buy cars for those who need them. Medical: Many migrant farmworkers can not afford to pay for medical services, however with the help of the foundation, many of the families are able to afford necessary medical services- such as dental care or surgery. Currently, the foundation works to give funds to over 11 different foundations in the forms of emergency aid. Education: Many migrant farmworkers' children are in need of aid to fund their educations. The Harvest of Hope Foundation raises money to assist those migrant students in their educational endeavors, from grade school to post secondary institutions. Finance Since its establishment, The Harvest of Hope Foundation has distributed more than $812,000 in emergency and educational financial aid to migrant farmworkers. Eighty (80) cents of every donated dollar goes to provide direct emergency and educational aid. Ten-twelve (10-12) cents of every dollar is used for administrative expenses. Only eight (8) cents of every dollar goes to the foundation’s president for his full-time work managing and maintaining the Harvest of Hope Foundation. These percentages are well balanced as compared to other non-profit organizations.http://www.mutinypr.com/assets/harvest_of_hope/hoh_press.pdf Because the Harvest of Hope Foundation receives more requests for aid than funds allow, the foundation has strict procedures for the distribution of funds. Individuals who request aid must show that they are willing to help themselves. Harvest of Hope Foundation provides a “helping-hand”, not a “hand- out.” The foundation works closely with teachers, social workers and advocates of migrant workers to coordinate the services and the distribution of money. Payments are typically made to landlords, mechanics, funeral homes and other service providers, and usually not to the individuals in need. Charity fundraising The Harvest of Hope Foundation is unique in that it is one of the few foundations which provides “direct services” in the form of immediate financial aid. This has proved detrimental in the foundation securing other foundation or corporate financial support that have policies prohibiting financial support to organizations providing “direct services.” As a result, the Harvest of Hope Foundation has raised funds in a variety of ways which have included the following: * Music events such as the Harvest of Hope Fest * Individual donations * Sales of Sweetwater Organic, Fair Trade Coffee * Donations of stock * A donated automobile * A foundation eBay account which sells donated collectibles and other memorabilia * Student service learning fundraisers which have included bake sales, concerts, car washes, restaurant events, raffles, pancake breakfasts and more. * Sales of antiques at an antique shop in Central Florida. * Donations made by shopping online via Good Shop * Donations made through searches conducted online via GoodSearch Affiliations and sponsors Against Me!

Romero of Gainesville's GraphicDesignsByTom.com became interested in the Harvest of Hope Foundation in 2004. Romero first heard about the foundation from a local radio broadcast which featured a segment that described the important emergency services the Harvest of Hope Foundation provided to migrant farmworkers and their families. Romero decided to contact the foundation to see if he could volunteer his graphic art abilities. Between 2004-2006, Romero continued to support the Harvest of Hope Foundation by devising advertising and marketing support material. In 2007, Romero partnered with Spearhead Media, a Gainesville web hosting company, to donate Web site hosting space for the redesign of the Harvest of Hope Foundation Web site. After the new Web site project was complete, in 2009, Romero started a new project that provided graphic support and print design services to the Harvest of Hope Foundation's 1st annual Harvest of Hope Fest. To date, Romero is still producing print designs that include a series of marketing brochures featuring photographs from Colorado photographer Celia Roberts. Spearhead Media, based in Gainesville, Florida, specializes in high quality Web site design, hosting and development. Spearhead Media also provides support services, e-commerce and content management tools for micro, small and medium-sized businesses.

It sits on the northeast corner of Riverside Drive and West 103rd Street. The Master Apartments is one of the city's first mixed- use structures as well as the tallest building on Riverside Drive. It was the first skyscraper in New York City to feature corner windows and the first to employ brick in varying colors for its entire exterior. The Master Apartments' name derives from the Master Institute of United Arts, an art institute founded in 1920 by Nicholas and Helena Roerich. The institute's name, in turn, may have come either from Master Morya, a non-corporeal spiritual leader from whom Helena Roerich received guidance via automatic writing, or from Nicholas Roerich, a theosophist master. In 1925, wealthy financier Louis L. Horch, who funded the Roeriches' institutes and some other expenses, began purchasing lots to build the apartment building, and in 1928, secured a bond to fund its construction. Harvey Wiley Corbett; Helmle, Corbett & Harrison; and Sugarman & Berger constructed the Master Apartments, which opened in 1929 to generally positive acclaim. As built, the building's lower floors consisted of a museum; a school for the fine and performing arts; and an international art center. Soon after the Master Apartments' opening, the building and the institute both experienced monetary deficits, with the building going into foreclosure in 1932. Two years later, Horch had his tax-exempt corporation, Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., become the building's landlord, with receivership ending the next year in 1935. Soon after, the Horch and Roerich families dissolved their partnership due to disagreements, and the Roeriches unsuccessfully sued Horch to regain control of the Master Apartments. Horch then closed the Roeriches' museum, forcing it to find a new location, and replaced it with the Riverside Museum. Louis Horch's wife Nettie also controlled some aspects of the building and its organizations during this time, but by 1958, the Horches' son Frank became the building's manager. During the 1950s and 1960s, people moved out of the surrounding Manhattan Valley neighborhood. Consequently, the Master Apartments' museum and cultural center closed by 1971, their holdings dispersed elsewhere, although the building's auditorium was still used for cultural events. After Louis's death in 1979, the building was bought by real estate investor Sol Goldman, who converted it to a housing co-operative over the next decade. Further renovations, which were completed in 2005, resulted in many of the one-bedroom studios being combined into two- and three-bedroom units. These renovations attracted more families and made the building more luxurious by both quality-of-life and purchase-price measures. The Master Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Naming and location Although \\"Master Building\\" is the name that appeared on official documents, the structure has long been known as Master Apartments or The Master. From 1939 onward newspaper advertising used both names constantly. One 1939 ad listed \\"The Master. Choice 1, 2 room suites, serving pantries, full hotel service, all rooms outside; from $50 month unfurnished; few furnished, $65 month. Popular price restaurant. Home of Riverside Museum. Concerts, lectures, recitals free to residents.\\" The building continued to be called by both names after conversion to a housing cooperative in 1988. At that time it was described as having 335 apartments on 28 floors served by four elevators. Buyers were permitted to finance up to 90% of the purchase price and 28% of the monthly maintenance fee was tax deductible. The Master Apartments is located in the borough of Manhattan, on lot 40 of block 1890. In the building zoning map, it is classified as an Elevator Apartments, Cooperative (D4). The building is located within Community District 107, City Council District 6, and NYPD 24th Precinct. The nearest zoned school is PS 145 Bloomingdale School (K-5). BackgroundConception= The skyscraper's first three floors originally held a museum, a school of the fine and performing arts, and an international art center. These three organizations were inspired by Nicholas Roerich and his wife Helena, and were largely funded by a wealthy financier, Louis L. Horch. Both the building and the institute take their name primarily from Master Morya, a non-corporeal spiritual leader from whom Helena Roerich received guidance via automatic writing. A secondary source of the name was Roerich himself who was revered as a theosophist master, able to interpret the wisdom of ancient gurus to modern man. The Master Institute of United Arts came into being in 1920 as the Master School of United Arts. It struggled to survive until, in 1922, Louis Horch financed its transfer from a single-room, all-in-one studio at 314 West 54th Street to a mansion he bought on the site where the Master Building would later be constructed. Horch's wife, Nettie Horch, was a friend of Frances Grant who directed the Master School for the Roeriches. Nettie and Louis were patrons of the arts and ardent believers in art education as an indirect means of promoting harmony among the peoples of the world. They were attracted to the spiritual quest in which the Roeriches were engaged and participated in sessions during which Helena Roerich would receive instructions from Master Morya (or other esoteric beings) and Nicholas Roerich would record them on scrolls of paper that were later transcribed into a series of texts, the Leaves of Morya's Garden. Their teachings became the core of a spiritual and cultural movement known as Roerichism. The Master Institute aimed to give students a well-rounded education in the arts and also to \\"open the gates to spiritual enlightenment\\" through culture. The mansion where it was located also housed the Roerich Museum, containing many of the thousands of paintings Roerich had created, and Corona Mundi, which arranged for exhibitions of paintings by Roerich and international artists. =Preparation for construction= In 1925, while the Roeriches were engaged in a long period of travel in Central Asia, Horch began to acquire the lots surrounding the mansion to construct the Master Building. The Roeriches' extensive travels were almost entirely funded by Louis Horch. As is common when assembling adjacent lots for a single purpose, he used dummies as purchasers. In doing this he followed a pattern he had established in providing an organizational structure for the Master Institute when he installed the Roeriches and their close associates as nominal shareholders and corporate officers. In 1928, Horch formed a corporation, Master Building, Inc., in which he was president. The corporation was appointed to plan and construct a skyscraper to replace the mansion in which the museum, institute, and outreach center were located. The architect was Harvey Wiley Corbett, of the architectural firm Helmle, Corbett & Harrison. Plans filed in January 1928 called for a 24-story apartment hotel, topped by a stupa – a Buddhist shrine in the shape of a staggered pyramid with a spire on top. When the building was constructed, plans for the stupa were scrapped in favor of an additional three stories. The building was designed to contain 406 rooms. Its cost was given as about $1,700,000 (). The building was to house a large and a small auditorium, two art libraries, conference rooms, and studios, in addition to three cultural institutions. These would all be located on the first three floors with the remaining stories containing an apartment hotel complying with New York City tenement laws. There were to be 390 apartments, with the majority having one bedroom and several having two or three bedrooms. An article in the New York Times said the planned building was to be \\"New York's first skyscraper art gallery\\" and an art critic for the Washington Post called it \\"a shrine of art with a truly American architectural expression.\\" On June 15, 1928, Horch arranged for the American Bond and Mortgage Company to underwrite a bond of $1,925,000 to cover costs. The bonds, which were linked to the price of gold, were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company. Prospective purchasers of the bonds were told that Horch and an associate guaranteed payment of principal and interest personally and that the income from rentals was expected far to exceed expenses, including both interest costs and amounts to be committed to the sinking fund. Early yearsConstruction= Helmle, Corbett & Harrison teamed with another architectural firm, Sugarman & Berger. Henry Sugarman, of the latter organization, advised in the building's design and supervised interior construction work. The cornerstone was laid on March 24, 1929. It has an all- black irregular shape stepped like the building. On it are inscribed the year 1929 and a symbol designed by Roerich consisting of a circle enclosing three dots together with a monogram. The monogram, showing the letter R within the letter M, stands for the Roerich Museum. The circle and the three dots are the symbol of Roerich's Banner of Peace. He once said the circle represents eternity and unity and the dots the triune nature of existence. On another occasion he said the symbol has two meanings: in one interpretation, the circle represents the totality of culture and the dots are art, science, and religion (or philosophy), while in the other, the circle symbolizes the endlessness of time and the dots are the past, the present, and the future. The cornerstone contains a 400-year-old casket from the Rajput dynasty of northern India. Made of iron with inlays of gold and silver, the casket contains photographs taken during the Roeriches' expedition to Central Asia. It is also said to contain Jacob's Pillow or the Stone of Scone. Prominent politicians participated in the cornerstone-laying ceremony and among messages read from prominent Americans was a letter from Albert Einstein in which he praised the cultural goals of the building's directors. Horch expended $2,497,164 for land and construction costs. He used $1,790,500 of the mortgage bond issue, $64,500 of a second mortgage, and made up the rest from a loan he himself made. The completed structure had 233 one-room, 63 two-room, and two three-room apartments as well as a penthouse suite of seven rooms. It had a series of recessions and terraces beginning at the sixteenth story which culminate in a tower. Its steel skeleton was interior, lacking the corner columns that were present in other buildings of the time. It had a brick exterior that was deep purple in its lower stories gradually growing lighter in color until at the top a faint lavender blended into pure white. Harvey Wiley Corbett said the coloration gave the skyscraper a \\"feeling of growth.\\" He said, \\"this colored brick exterior, which rises from a low, dark ground to a gleaming, white pinnacle, gives the building a dynamic quality. The play of sunlight on the many hues will make the building a beautiful spectacle of changing colors.\\" At its opening, press reports emphasized the opportunity for people to rent apartments in a building devoted to the arts and drew attention to the rapid growth of the Institute's cultural ideal of united arts, over seven years, from being housed in a single classroom to moving to a skyscraper. However, many reports did not describe religious factors, with one source saying that \\"the institution had nothing to do with cults and only with culture.\\" =Financial problems= Master Building, 1929 view The Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred only weeks after the building was completed. At that time more than 80% of the apartments were rented and some 300 students had signed up to take classes at the Institute. However, both rentals and student fees were soon depleted, and the nonprofit corporation that ran the building was unable to meet its payments. On April 6, 1932, this organization was sued for nonpayment of taxes and sinking fund payments due on the mortgage bonds. At that time, it was alleged that the building was being mismanaged, the principal evidence offered being the provision of free living quarters to the Roeriches and their followers. Horch successfully contested the suit, partly on a technicality and partly by explaining that the 20 rooms occupied rent- free were used by management as partial compensation to employees of the corporation. Representatives of the bond holders had argued that the parts of the building that did not produce rental income—that is, the museum, institute, and other cultural spaces—should be converted to apartments, but Horch successfully countered that the cultural spaces were an asset that generated a substantial tax exemption and that, in normal times, they led to higher rental rates from the existing apartments than would comparable apartments. He also pointed out that the demanded conversion would be expensive (about $100,000). In June 1932, the foreclosure case ended, with Horch being named one of two receivers tasked with clearing the building's debts. In 1934, Horch arranged to have Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., the educational corporation he had created in 1923, take over responsibility for the building from the organization he had previously used to run it. He did this because the Institute was free of debt and, due to its status as an educational organization, was tax-exempt. In 1935, the receivership ended and control over the Master Building and the cultural organizations it contained was turned over to the Master Institute of United Arts, Inc. with Horch as its president. At this time, Horch arranged for the Institute to give a five-year mortgage for $1,674,800 to the entity that managed the building (now organized as the Riverside Drive & 103d Street Corporation) at five and one-half percent interest. Horch, who had remained a devoted follower of the Roeriches since his acceptance of their spiritual quest as his own in 1923, started to fall out with them, for unclear reasons. The Roeriches maintained that Horch's motives were base: through guile and deception, they said, he had taken control of the Master Building, closed the cultural institutions it contained, and severed them and their associates from everything connected with the building and its contents. Horch countered that the Roeriches had improperly attempted to countermand his decisions as building owner and director of the cultural organizations it contained. He said they had shown bad faith when they asserted that they alone could receive and interpret the commands of the supreme being whom they all worshiped. On June 8, 1935, he wrote Helena Roerich to say he feared that the Roeriches had lost confidence in himself and his wife Nettie. Then, on July 13, 1935, Nettie wrote Helena of her and Horch's \\"fourteen years of complete devotion in heart and in deed\\" and of their enduring \\"loyalty and selfless sacrifice\\" over that period. She reaffirmed their \\"flaming devotion\\" which they continued to hold in their hearts. And she said the Roeriches' attempt to exert unilateral control over their affairs had caused them to \\"contemplate, review and think of matters in a new light.\\" These letters explain actions that Horch took on June 5, 1936, to sever relations between the Institute and the other cultural organizations housed at the Master Building and discharge all their employees. The employees who occupied rent-free apartments were told to vacate immediately. In February 1936, the Roeriches and their associates attempted to obtain an injunction to prevent these actions. When the attempt failed, they sued Horch to regain what they believed to be their rightful authority to participate in the operation of the building and its component organizations. This case was settled on February 9, 1938, in favor of Horch. George Frankenthaler, the referee who decided the case, found that the Roeriches never possessed the authority they claimed. Horch alone administered the corporation that had the building constructed, ran the organizations that it housed, and obtained all the needed financing. In addition, he donated more than a million dollars of his own money, while the Roeriches and their associates had contributed no funds at all. Regarding allegations of deception, he found Horch to be the more creditable witness. =Riverside Museum= In 2004 Not long afterwards, Horch closed the Roerich Museum, which subsequently moved to a new location at 319 West 107th Street in 1949. In the Roerich Museum's former space, Horch established the Riverside Museum. He became president of the new museum and appointed Vernon C. Porter as its director. Open to the public free of charge, the new museum was devoted mainly to exhibitions of contemporary art by American artists. At its opening in on June 4, 1938, the museum showed modern American paintings and work by Native Americans as well as Tibetan art objects that Roerich had given to Horch. The American artists included Stuart Davis, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Jack Levine, Marsden Hartley, George Luks, John Sloan, Philip Evergood, Reginald Marsh, Charles Burchfield, and Rockwell Kent. In 1939 the museum began hosting the annual exhibitions of American Abstract Artists, a group devoted to expanding appreciation of non-objective art that had been formed in 1936. The show included more than 300 oils, watercolors, pastels, collages, drawings, constructions, and sculpture. That year it also began hosting exhibitions held by the New York Society of Women Artists, a group that had been founded in 1926 to promote the work of avant garde women artists. Other 1939 shows included contemporary works by artists from Poland, documentary photographs of child laborers by Lewis Hine, an international exhibition of works by women artists, and a large display of Pan-American art. Over the next few decades the museum would specialize in exhibitions by members of artists' groups. In addition to the two already named, these included the Silvermine Guild of Artists (a Connecticut summer art colony), the Manhattan Camera Club, the Photo-Engravers' Art Society, the Brooklyn Society of Artists, the Artists Equity Group, and USCO (a collective from the Woodstock, New York art colony and Garnerville, New York). The museum was organized as a unit of the Master Institute of United Arts. As it had previously done, the institute gave art classes, provided studio space, and sponsored lectures, concerts, poetry readings, art clinics, and other cultural events. Porter served as the museum's director through the 1940s. He was succeeded by Nettie Horch, who had been in charge of the Institute's cultural events since the building opened. She was assisted by her daughter, Oriole, who took over direction of the museum and cultural events in the late 1960s. =Role of Nettie Horch= In addition to running the museum, Nettie had a large role in running the Master Building as a whole; however, the exact division of responsibilities between Nettie and her husband is unclear. She was secretary of the corporation, although this may have been a nominal position as Louis and his lawyer prepared most of the corporation's correspondence and its filings. She also probably helped her husband decide to provide more than one million dollars toward achieving the Roeriches' spiritual and cultural ambitions. She met with the Roeriches and their other supporters in making plans for the Roerich Museum, Master Institute, Corona Mundi, and the other organizations housed in the Master Building. She was active as president of the Roerich Society and, after its demise, directed the Riverside Museum for many years. Later years In 2008 =Neighborhood decline= During the 1950s and 1960s, the Manhattan Valley neighborhood (then known as Bloomingdale), where the Master Building is located, saw its culturally-oriented middle class renters depart. Many of them, it was said, opted to buy houses in the suburban New York metropolitan area. As a consequence, the museum and cultural center lost their audience and in 1971 they were forced to close. Their holdings were donated to Brandeis University and cultural initiatives such as the Master Institute Chorus, founded in 1960, either folded, or, as in the case of the chorus, became affiliated with other organizations, such as the New Amsterdam Singers. The Horches' daughter, Oriole, became advisory consultant for the collection at Brandeis. The building's auditorium continued to present concerts, plays, readings, and lectures in the 1940s and into the 1950s. From 1961 through 1978 the Equity Library Theater leased it for productions showcasing the talents of New York actors. As chair of Bloomington Conservation Project, Horch and the Master Institute of United Arts led an effort to improve deteriorated housing by converting single-family brownstone buildings into rent-subsidized apartments. Efforts like those of this project ameliorated conditions to some extent, but the Bloomingdale area did not return to prosperity until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the city as a whole experienced an economic rebound. As high-paying white-collar employment in financial institutions and other service industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in the industrial sector, real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them. =Master Apartments co-op and renovations= In 1958, Louis Horch made his son Frank manager of the building, which continued until Frank was murdered during a 1975 robbery. In 1970–71, Louis transferred partial ownership of the building to Frank and Oriole. In 1971 Louis and Nettie Horch moved to Florida, when he was 83 years old and she was 76. Following the death of Louis in 1979, the Horch family sold the Master Building to a real estate investor, Sol Goldman, who was then the city's largest private landlord. Goldman continued to operate the building as rental apartments until 1982 when he formed a company, Manhattan Master Apartment Associates, to convert it to a housing co- operative. The conversion was completed in 1988 when that company transferred control to a new organization, Master Apartments, Inc. After renovations were finished in 2005, the number of two- and three-bedroom units was increased dramatically, due to the combination of the building's original studio apartments. The larger layouts attracted more families to the cooperative community. In recent years the lobby has been restored, hallways remodeled, and amenities increased, including larger storage areas, a bike room, and an improved laundry facility. The building is now said to be luxurious as measured both by residents' quality of living and by the purchase prices they pay. In 2016, the Master Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Landmarks Preservation Commission report on the building praises its \\"successful employment of sculptural massing, vertical emphasis, and the minimal, yet elegant, use of surface ornamentation and historically- inspired detailing.\\" Critics have praised the adept handling of the transitions between the base and tower, \\"as square and chamfered corners established a sprightly syncopation against the more thunderous beat of the central masses.\\" See also *List of buildings, sites, and monuments in New York City *List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets *National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan above 59th to 110th Streets Notes References  External links  * *Master Apartments (Kenneth G.

It did not play any significant role in history or politics, yet its lifespan of 1,300 years is worth note. Harsh terrain made it difficult to survive, but like other towns along the coast, it thrived on the production of Tyrian dye.  Location and name  The town's position is fixed by the Stadiasmus at 60 stadia west of Somena, and 64 stadia west of Andriace. Leake (Asia Minor, p. 188) supposes Somena to be the Simena of Pliny (v. 27). Aperlae, which is written in the text of Claudius Ptolemy Aperrae, and in Pliny Apyrae, is proved to be a genuine name by an inscription found by Cockerell, at the head of Hassar bay, with the ethnic name Ἀπερλειτων on it. But there are also coins of Gordian III with the ethnic name Ἀπερραιτων. The confusion between the \\"l\\" and the \\"r\\" in the name of a small place is nothing remarkable. = Geography = Aperlae is situated near a bay and had harsh conditions all around. The sea in this region was unreliable in a storm and the bay offered near no protection from weather. It was directly between the mountains and the coast, the city's fortifications didn't encompass the arable terraced part of the mountains. There were no reliable sources of fresh water, but numerous cisterns located around the town indicated a heavy reliance on rain water. Aperlae was near a faultline leading to the seaside district of Aperlae sinking due to slow slumping over time. The most defining feature of the Aperlae landscape was the vast amount of Murex snail shells. There were two distinct parts of town where they were dumped covering altogether 1,600 square meters (at an unknown depth until the Turkish government allows archeologists to dig), they were discovered in the mortar and concrete of the buildings of the city, and they were found in large quantities dumped into the ocean.  History  Aperlae was founded sometime between the late 4th and early 3rd century BCE and sustained a long lifespan of about 1,300 years until the end of the 7th century AD. With the start of the Muslim conquests, security of the coast failed and Aperlae was abandoned due to the threat of pirate raids and Arab corsairs. Though with the evidence of some late repairs on a church suggest that there was possibly a small settlement of squatters or stragglers after it was left, Aperlae was never rebuilt and resettled.  Economy  The economy was built around the production of Tyrian dye, a deep and costly purple which is gleaned from the hypobroncial gland of the Murex trunculus (which has been reclassified as Hexaplex trunculus), said to have cost 20 times its weight in gold. Experiments conducted in 1909 concluded that it would take 12,000 snails to produce 1.4 grams or 0.05 oz. Three ceramic lined vats found in the sunken district are suggested to have been holding tanks for the live snails until there were enough to be processed. Evidence of the presence of other mollusks in these piles indicates that the Murex were collected using nets and not by hand. Though there was a rudimentary harbor with a jetty but not a breakwater, it is evident from the opulence presented by the city that there were more than enough resources to make one if they wanted. The city boasted four churches, a great number of tombstones and good fortifications which indicate an affluence of that time.  Ecclesiastical history  Since it was in the Roman province of Lycia, the bishopric of Aperlae was a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Myra, the province's capital, and was among the most important of the suffragan sees, being mentioned in fifth place in the Notitiae Episcopatuum of Pseudo-Epiphanius, composed under Byzantine Emperor Heraclius in about 640.Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte und ungenügend veröffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum, in: Abhandlungen der philosophisch-historische classe der bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1901, p. 539, nº 258. No name of any of its bishops was identified by Le Quien in his Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus. = Titular see = No longer a residential bishopric, Aperlae is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see,Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 835 as the diocese was nominally restored in 1933, the curiate Italian name version being Aperle.

She is a New York-educated nurse from Bacolod, Negros Occidental and was crowned Miss Philippines Earth 2009 in San Juan City, Philippines. She represented her country in the Miss Earth 2009, the 9th edition of Miss Earth international pageant, where she was crowned Miss Earth Air (1st Runner-up) on 22 November 2009. Biography Seifert (also known by the nickname \\"Schazee\\") was born on 1 February 1984 in Taipei, Taiwan. Her parents are Zenaida Suravilla and Harald Seifert.http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/226911/miss-earth-unveil-new- crown Seifert attended elementary school at Montessori and St. Scholastica’s Academy in Bacolod City, and returned to Manila to complete middle school at the German Branch of the European International School, Manila (on the Eurocampus Manila), where she graduated Valedictorian, the highest rank among the graduating class. After attending Eurocampus, she continued her high school education at Brent International School in Biñan, Laguna. Seifert moved to New York where she excelled as a \\"straight A\\" student at the City University of New York and obtained her Nursing Degree. She participated in several extra-curricular activities; Seifert was elected President of the International Honor Society Phi Theta Kappa for the New York Chapter. She also extended her assistance as a tutor for other Nursing students, and as a Note- Taker for Students with Disabilities. She represented her college during the Salzburg Seminar in Austria, and was nominated as an exemplary student by the President of her college, which eventually led to her appearance on the City University of New York print ad in 2008. That same year, Seifert passed the New York Nursing Board Examination (NCLEX). Seifert plays basketball and volleyball. She is also into competitive swimming; she won the silver medal during the swimming competition of the South-East Asian Games held in Jakarta, Indonesia, representing her school. Seifert speaks four languages fluently: German, English, Filipino, and French. She also speaks a Filipino native language Hiligaynon (informally known as Ilonggo), an Austronesian language spoken in Western Visayas in the Philippines. In addition, she has basic knowledge of Spanish and Italian languages. Early career Seifert was first discovered by a talent scout/make-up artist at the age of 14. After only a few castings, Seifert received a call to join her first fashion show for a French eyewear company. In 1998 she joined the Philippines' Elite Model Search where she won the Viva Look of the Year title and represented the Philippines in the international Elite Model Look Search, which was held in Nice, France. Seifert was part of the Colgate Mintirinse ad campaign \\"Minti Cool\\" along with Anne Curtis and Aubrey Vizcarra. When Colgate decided to have a remake of that ad campaign a few years later, Michael Seifert (Sandra Seifert's brother) appeared as the male lead role alongside the new cast. She was a muse for two Philippine Basketball Association teams, a professional basketball league in the Philippines: Red Bull in 2002 and FedEx in 2003. An avid basketball player herself, she also played for her school's women's team. Seifert has done several national and international advertising commercials and graced many of Manila's hottest fashion shows including Philippine Fashion Week, Speedo, Benetton, Lancôme, and Bulgari Jewelry. While seen in ample fashion shoots, Seifert has written articles for magazines, well- tackling social awareness issues. In addition, she has been visible in numerous print ads and appeared on magazine covers including MEGA, Speed, and A&F.; However, it was through her hosting job in the late night show \\"Master Showman,\\" that she gained much recognition and popularity all over the Philippines. Aside from Master Showman, she also hosted the now defunct television show Campus Video with co- host Derek Ramsey. Her hosting opportunities were soon followed by traveling in and out of the Philippines as she signed up with a Thailand-based modeling agency.

She was crowned by the outgoing titleholder, Miss Earth 2008 Karla Henry, on 10 May 2009 at The Arena Entertainment and Recreational Center of the People, San Juan City. Seifert was also an early favorite in the Miss Philippines Earth 2009 pageant, collecting four special citations: Best in Cultural Costume, Miss RCBC E-Woman, Gandang Ricky Reyes and Best in Swimsuit. Seifert’s white \\"Pearl of the Orient\\" gown, a modern interpretation of the terno (a long dress in the Philippines characterized by broad “butterfly” sleeves that rise slightly at the shoulders and extend about to the elbow) featuring a feathered mask and layered Spanish lace embellished in crystals, beads, and pearls was designed by Frederick Peralta. She won P250,000, plus other prizes, and represented the Philippines in the Miss Earth pageant later that year. She also impressed the judges during the final question and answer portion of the pageant with her answer to the final question “With global environment changing, what would you like to change in yourself that will make you a better pro-environment person?\\" Seifert said: “When I joined Miss Earth I became aware of the things I can do as a Filipino and as a citizen of the world. I would like to share this awareness with more people, whether on a personal level or through the media. I want to make a difference in every little way I can.” Negros Occidental Governor Isidro Zayco said Negrenses welcomed her success in the pageant.

Palmer Street is a major student neighborhood of Ohio University. The event regularly attracts regional attention as tens of thousands of students from universities around the state gather on the street, and has attracted controversy over reported binge drinking and other disruptive behavior. The origins of Palmerfest can be traced to 1988, where the residents of 5 ,6, 7 and 8 Palmer Street bought kegs and had a massive block party, culinating with a performance of an America cover band in the backyard of 7 Palmer Street. The tradition was continued and was named Palmerfest in 1991. The street fest's original iteration included 500 friends and neighbors of the street residents. During the first Palmer Fest, residents pooled their money together to rent a beer trailer. In 1992, individual residents hosted their own house parties with a concentration of people gathering in the backyards of 19, 21, 23 and 25 Palmer Street. After 25 years of annual parties, the attendance of the fest has grown to around 8,000 people. Substantial police presence is required each year, and the event attracted attention throughout the state as the 2009 and 2010 iterations of the party had to be shut down by riot police after \\"near riots\\" erupted with intoxicated attendees setting fires to furniture in the streets and throwing debris at officer and fire department crews attempting to control the crowds. Subsequent backlash saw the city crack down on party ordinances, though Palmer Fest has spawned spinoff parties in town and around the state.  Palmerfest  The event is held on Palmer Street near the central east section of the city, a street long composed primarily of student- rented houses from undergraduates at Ohio University; it is surrounded on three sides by streets which also consist primarily of student-rented houses, as well as the student-leased Palmer Place apartment complex to the northwest. Palmerfest is one of the largest events in the town each spring, and publicity of the event rivals the larger Halloween celebration held in the town each October, which is a city-sanctioned event. The Palmerfest party, however, is held entirely by residents of Palmer Street and surrounding areas, who are almost exclusively students, who often erect temporary fencing around their houses and admit friends and classmates. The string of house parties, which take place throughout the day, often involve beer pong and other drinking activities. Annually revelers build stages around the houses on the street where local bands play music throughout the day. Street vendors often set up businesses at the ends of the street, and food carts report substantially improved business the weekend of Palmerfest. Athens and Ohio University police maintain a large presence at the party, often mounted police patrol the street and area to prevent the event from spiraling out of control. The event often produces large amounts of trash, and police are on hand the next day to supervise cleanup and ensure the houses do not violate city trash ordinances. Consequently, cleanup of the event often falls upon the residents of the respective houses.  History  Origins = In the late 1980s, residents of Palmer Street began hosting a string of parties after the university removed alcohol from its annual Spring Fest and Green weekends because of changes in state liquor laws and drinking age. Spring Fest, which had been held on university grounds and featured alcohol vendors, was made alcohol-free in 1989, and attendance dropped sharply, prompting residents of Palmer Street to hold a fest of their own to replace it. While not officially advertised as Palmerfest, the original party was organised and put on by the residents of 4 and 6 Palmer Street and held in an adjoining lot behind the properties. The term \\"Palmerfest\\" was coined by one of the bands playing that night (18th Emergency). The original party started with 16 kegs of beer (depleted by 9:30 p.m.), a glow stick vendor, a T-Shirt vendor, a band, and it grew out of control with an open BYOB policy and a drive-thru in close proximity. The police were caught off-guard by the large number of people that attended and for that reason told organizers to contain attendees and shut it down at 11:00 p.m. or risk arrest. The next attempt in 1990 saw a lesser event due to police intervention early. Palmerfest was revived officially on April 12, 1991. The event was attended by about 500 friends of the street residents and with only 15 beer kegs. Palmerfest grew in size with each successive year as word of the party spread. In general, each Palmerfest event was described as \\"peaceful\\" with minimal police intervention. Ohio University officials have coordinated with the residents of the street to ensure the event was as safe as possible. Historically, heavy police presence was only necessitated to break up fights or if there is property damage or disorderly behavior. Police traditionally did not need a major presence on the street. However, Ohio University, in an effort to tone down the school's party school image, cracked down on punishment for drinking. University officials noted in the years leading up to the 2009 fest, the university was seeing a measure of success in regulating student behavior and restraining drinking. The 2008 Palmerfest party was mostly quiet, though a lawsuit was filed by an attendee who claimed he was struck and injured by a water balloon thrown by a student resident of the street. = 2009 \\"near riot\\" = By the May 9, 2009 Palmerfest, attendance had grown to an estimated 8,000 people, including a significant number of students from other universities around the state. The 2009 Palmerfest attracted statewide attention after a \\"near riot\\" erupted on Palmer Street around 10 p.m. when partiers began setting fires to furniture in the street and assaulting police officers and firefighters who attempted to put out the blaze. Around 10:00 p.m. officers responded to the first reports of a furniture fire in the street, and riot police moved down the street escorting a fire engine. Firefighters put out the blaze, but attendees quickly became belligerent and the crowd began shouting insults at the police, who withdrew. By 10:30, several more furniture fires were started in the street, and when police and firefighters attempted to return and extinguish the blazes, the crowd turned violent, throwing bottles of beer at police. Five police horses were injured, most by thrown glass bottles, and police reported a substantial amount of debris being thrown at them. Attendees of the party were packing the rooftops and alleys in between houses, some of whom participating in throwing debris and chanting slogans with the crowds surrounding the fires. Police responded by calling in reinforcements and 40 riot police and mounted police armed with batons and pepper spray confronted revelers and pushed them from the street and surrounding yards. Attendees criticized the behavior of the police as overly violent. The town responded with several new safety ordinances guiding party behavior for students, including an attempted ordinance banning house concerts, as local code enforcement saw them as unsafe and potentially hazardous for fires. OU Dean of Students Dean Lombardi released a statement condemning the behavior, and police used online photos and YouTube to try and identify people responsible for the riotous behavior, and OU also announced efforts to hold students involved responsible. = 2010 and town backlash = The 2010 Palmerfest, which saw attendance of 8,000 despite unseasonably cold weather. The May 8, 2010 Palmerfest began early, around 8:00 a.m. and remained relatively calm throughout the day, spurred mainly by unseasonably cooler weather. Crowds did not block traffic or behave riotously throughout the early day, though police noted at 6:00 p.m. the tone of the crowd began to shift. At 9:20 p.m. police shut down two parties on the street due to lighting of fireworks, provoking significant antagonism from the crowd. The crowd quickly began to grow more hostile, and after 11 p.m. attendees began throwing objects at the officers. Mounted police began sweeping the sidewalks and several yards, following people who had assaulted them with objects. One officer fell off his horse while attempting to control the crowd. By 11:35 p.m. 50 riot police appeared on the street and began clearing it, armed with batons and pepper spray. One officer and one police horse were injured. A total of 82 people were arrested during the weekend, 31 by Athens Police and 51 by state liquor control agents. Most of the arrests involved alcohol, though several arrests for rioting and felonious assault on an officer were also reported. Police subsequently created a website to identify people responsible for starting fires, taking pictures of the event from Facebook pages of people who attended the event. OU President Roderick McDavis subsequently released a written statement expressing outrage at the event, promising to hold any involved students responsible and meeting with city officials to plan preventive measures to prevent future events from spinning out of control in a similar manner. = 2011 = Mounted police watch the 2011 Palmerfest from the south end of the street The May 7, 2011 Palmerfest was called \\"uneventful\\" by police, and in spite of statewide attention the event remained calm, spurred greatly by rains throughout the day. Fires and other rioting behavior were not reported. Police reported attendees were substantially less rowdy than in previous years, never blocking the street to traffic, and crowds never escalated to violent action, as they had in the two years past. Police also attributed increased officer presence at the event and the more aggressive communication campaign to success at keeping the party in order. However, police arrested about 170 people in connection with the event, many for underage drinking. The Ohio Department of Public Safety's investigative unit reported 172 arrests in Athens between May 6 and May 8, accounting for 86 percent of its arrests statewide. Most were for underage drinking or possession of fake IDs. = 2012 = Palmerfest moved back into April, turned 21, and had a house set on fire. A riot zone was declared by the mayor of Athens around 7:50 p.m. and the spring fest was shut down shortly after.  Legacy  The growing popularity of Palmerfest spawned similar events on other streets throughout the town. Other events, all of them coordinated house parties by houses along the same street, have subsequently sprung up on Oak Street (Oakfest) Mill Street (Millfest) and High Street (Highfest), among others. Increased attention to the Athens area during the fests means the town continually leads the state for annual arrests by the Ohio Investigative Unit.

The school received national media attention when two other schools offered to forfeit games rather than play against a racially integrated opponent. The opponents, Sharkey-Issaquena Academy and the East Holmes Academy, claimed that injuries, not race, were the reason for forfeiting the games. Heritage Academy headmaster and head coach Ray Wooten rejected the other schools' denials, referring to them as \\"a bunch of bull.\\" After seven players and two school board members resigned, East Holmes Academy reconsidered its decision to forfeit. The black player, sophomore running back Scott Fuller, offered to quit the Heritage Academy team so the game could be played, but coach Ray Wooten insisted that Fuller remain on the team. Jabari O.

The house stayed in the family line of Abigail and Thomas Lyon in to the 20th century. Thomas Lyon (1621–1690) The first Thomas Lyon was born in England about 1621. He is reported to have come first to the Massachusetts Colony, and thence to have gone to seek his fortune in the 'far west' of Fairfield County, CT. His first wife was Martha Johanna Winthrop, the only child of Elizabeth Fones Winthrop and her husband Henry Winthrop, second son of Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Martha had been born May 9, 1630 at Groton Manor, the Winthrop home in England, and as an infant sailed to the Massachusetts Bay Colony with her mother, arriving November 2, 1631. In the early 1640s, the young Martha moved with her parents to their newly acquired property encompassing the area known now as Old Greenwich in Fairfield County, CT. Martha married Thomas Lyon circa 1647, and they had one child, Mary Lyon, born August 1649. Having battled frail health for some years, Martha (Winthrop) Lyon died in her early twenties, likely in 1653. Thomas Lyon remarried in 1654 to Mary Hoyt, daughter of Simon Hoyt of Stamford, CT. This Thomas Lyon died in Greenwich in 1690, and was buried in the old Lyon family burying ground at Byram Neck. His will left extensive land holdings in the area to his children, including his son Thomas Lyon. Thomas Lyon (1673–1739) Thomas Lyon was born in 1673 to Thomas Lyon and his second wife, Mary Hoyt. This younger Thomas Lyon married Abigail Ogden, daughter of Judith (Budd) and John Ogden. This Thomas Lyon \\"built the house near Byram Bridge, which is still standing, having been occupied until the present time [1907] by his descendants.\\" In 1711, Thomas Lyon was called into short-term military service on the Canada–US border as a member of Col. Robert Hunter's Company of Fusiliers. This Thomas Lyon died in April, 1739, with his will proven May 1 of that year. His wife, Abigail (Ogden) Lyon, lived until 1760; ownership of the house went to the next generation in their family. Sources  It is to two sources that we are indebted for much of the knowledge we have of the life and descendants of Thomas Lyon (1621–1690): 1) Robert Charles Winthrop, a lineal descendant of Governor John Winthrop, who in 1891 published a number of letters found among the papers of Governor Winthrop, written by Thomas Lyon, his wife Martha (Winthrop) Lyon, and other members of the family.Geocities biography Thomas Lyons retrieved on 2009-05-11 and 2) Robert B. Miller, who edited the 1907 book Lyon Memorial which gives additional background on Thomas Lyon (#1) as well as detailed genealogical information on his descendants, including is son, Thomas Lyon, of the Thomas Lyon House.

Thirteen years after its release in 1996, it was made into the 2009 film Precious, which won numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards. Plot Claireece Precious Jones is an obese, illiterate 16-year-old girl who lives in Harlem with her abusive mother Mary. Precious is a few months pregnant with her second child, the product of her father raping her; he is also the father of her first child (who has Down syndrome). When her school discovers the pregnancy, it is decided that she should attend an alternative school. Precious is furious, but the counselor later visits her home and convinces her to enter an alternative school, located in the Hotel Theresa, called Higher Education Alternative Each One Teach One. Despite her mother's insistence that she apply for welfare, Precious enrolls in the school. She meets her teacher, Ms. Blu Rain, and fellow students Rhonda, Jermaine, Rita, Jo Ann, and Consuelo. All of the girls come from troubled backgrounds. Ms. Rain's class is a pre-GED class for young women who are below an eighth-grade level in reading and writing and therefore are unprepared for high school-level courses. They start off by learning the basics of phonics and vocabulary building. Despite their academic deficits, Ms. Rain ignites a passion in her students for literature and writing. She believes that the only way to learn to write is to write every day. Each girl is required to keep a journal. Ms. Rain reads their entries and provides feedback and advice. By the time the novel ends, the women have created an anthology of autobiographical stories called \\"LIFE STORIES – Our Class Book\\" appended to the book. The works of classic African-American writers such as Audre Lorde, Alice Walker and Langston Hughes are inspirational for the students. Precious is particularly moved by The Color Purple. While in the hospital giving birth to son Abdul Jamal Louis Jones, Precious tells a social worker that her first child is living with her grandmother. The confession leads to Precious' mother having her welfare taken away. When Precious returns home with Abdul, her enraged mother chases her out of the house. Homeless and alone, she first passes a night at the armory, then turns to Ms. Rain, who uses all of her resources to get Precious into a halfway house with childcare. Her new environment provides her with the stability and support to continue with school. The narrative prose, told from Precious' voice, continually improves in terms of grammar and spelling, and is even peppered with imagery and similes. Precious has taken up poetry, and is eventually awarded the Mayor's office's literacy award for outstanding progress. The accomplishment boosts her spirits. As her attitude changes and her confidence grows, Precious thinks about having a boyfriend, and a real relationship with someone near her age who attracts her interest. Her only sexual experience thus far has been the rape and sexual abuse by her mother and father. As she's trying to move beyond her traumatic childhood and distance herself from her parents, her mother turns up to announce that her father has died from AIDS. Testing verifies that Precious is HIV positive, but her children are not. Her classmate Rita encourages Precious to join a support group, as well as an HIV- positive group. The meetings provide a source of support and friendship for Precious as well as the revelation that her color and socioeconomic background weren't necessarily the cause of her abuse. Women of all ages and backgrounds attend the meetings. The book concludes with no specific fate outlined for Precious; the author leaving her future undetermined.  Style  Critics have gone in both directions as far as their opinions of the style in which Push is written. Some consider \\"the harrowing story line [to be] exaggerated,\\" saying that it doesn't seem realistic to \\"saddle one fictional character with so many problems straight from today's headlines\\" (Glenn). Others have stated that while the dialect is problematic, Precious herself is believable because she \\"speaks in a darting stream of consciousness of her days in an unexpectedly evocative fashion\\" (Mahoney). =Dialect/Voice= Precious begins the novel functionally illiterate. She spells words phonetically. She uses a \\"minimal English that defies the conventions of spelling and usage and dispenses all verbal decorum\\" (Mahoney). She employs variations such as \\"nuffin'\\" for nothing, \\"git\\" for get, \\"borned\\" for born, \\"wif\\" for with, and \\"chile\\" for child. She also uses an array of profanity and harsh details that reflect the life she has experienced. Michiko Kakutani, a book reviewer for The New York Times, states that Precious' \\"voice conjures up [her] gritty unforgiving world.\\" As the book progresses and Precious learns to read and write, there is a stark change in her voice, though the dialect remains the same. Sequel In 2011, Sapphire published a semi-sequel, The Kid. It follows the life of Precious' son Abdul from the age of nine to 19. Precious herself has died following complications from HIV, but was accepted to college before her death.

In: Kurbel, K., Becker, J., Gronau, N., Sinz, E., Suhl, L. (Eds.): Online Lexikon Wirtschaftsinformatik Online Encyclopedia Business Information Systems, Oldenbourg, 2008. * A global information system (GIS) is any information system which attempts to deliver the totality of measurable data worldwide within a defined context. Common to this class of information systems is that the context is a global setting, either for its use or development process. This means that it highly relates to distributed systems / distributed computing where the distribution is global. The term also incorporates aspects of global software development and there outsourcing (when the outsourcing locations are globally distributed) and offshoring aspects. A specific aspect of global information systems is the case (domain) of global software development.Sangwan, R., Bass, M., Mullick, N., Paulish, D.J., Kazmeier, J. (2006): Global Software Development Handbook, Auerback Publications, 2006. A main research aspect in this field concerns the coordination of and collaboration between virtual teams.Carmel, E. (1999): Global Software Teams: Collaborating Across Borders and Time Zones (High Performance Cluster Computing) - Garton, C., Wegryn, K. (2006): Managing Without Walls: Maximize Success with Virtual, Global, and Cross - Cultural Teams, MC Press, US, 2006. Further important aspects are the internationalization and language localization of system components.  Tasks in designing global information systems  Critical tasks in designing global information systems are * Process and system design: How are the processes between distributed actors organized, how are the systems distributed / integrated. * Technical architecture: What is the technical infrastructure enabling actors to collaborate? * Support mechanisms: How are actors in the process of communication, collaboration, and cooperation supported? A variety of examples can be given. Basically every multi-lingual website can be seen as a global information system. However, mostly the term GLIS is used to refer to a specific system developed or used in a global context.

It is located at 100 Selma Ave, Webster Groves, MO. The school is part of the Webster Groves School District and its current principal is Matt Irvin. History Webster Groves High School was first established in 1889 as a ninth grade course. The original high school building was located on Gray Avenue, which was later repurposed as Bristol Elementary School. In 1906, a new building for the school was built at its current location, 100 Selma Avenue. James Hixson served as principal from 1907 to 1943. At first the high school was a two-story brick building with three classrooms and an auditorium. In 1913 two wings were added to the school, which contained an auditorium and a gymnasium. In 1917 an Armory was erected, but it was converted to the gymnasium/lunch room after World War I. In 1946 that building was replaced by Roberts Gym, named after Charles A. Roberts, who coached and taught at the school for 39 years. In the 1920s a three-story section and public library were added. In 1935 an addition was completed that added the drama, home economics, and science department classrooms. Howard Latta's was principal from 1943 to 1968. WGHS was racially integrated in 1956, and in 1966 a three-story wing was added onto the back of the building and the Herbert Schooling Library was donated. Jerry Knight was principal from 1969 to 1986. Patricia Voss was principal 1994–2003. Since 1977, Voss had been an assistant principal at the high school. In October 2002 a white powdery substance found in a tissue box provoked a two-hour lockdown. Investigators later determined the substance was not Anthrax. The Webster Groves School Board appointed Jon Clark as principal in 2003. Clark had been an assistant principal at the high school for seven years. In 2011, construction began on a 106,000-square-foot addition to the school. Completed in 2012, this addition included new classrooms, state-of-the-art science labs, vocational labs, a main band room, private band practice rooms and art studios. The roof of the building also features a vegetation area surrounded by a glass curtain wall. In addition, three 20,000 gallon water harvesting tanks are located at the base of the building for rain collection and irrigation for the field behind the building. The expansion was built to resemble the look of the existing building, including the use of terrazzo floors and steps, and limestone accents. Facilities The Webster Groves High School building has 84 classrooms along with an auditorium, a media center, and a theater. It has a soccer field to the west and a baseball and softball field to the east. Moss Field, the football stadium, is located at Hixon Middle School at 630 South Elm Avenue, a short drive from the high school. The field was built in 1946 and has been renovated several times. It now has locker rooms, bleachers, lights and an all-weather track. Curriculum 24 credits are required to graduate from Webster Groves High School. The class of 2010 and every class thereafter need four credits of Communication Skills; three credits each of Science, Math, and Social Studies; one Fine Art credit; one and a half credits each of Practical Arts and Physical Education; and six and a half Elective Credits. Students are also required to take a half credit of Personal Finance, which is considered either a practical art or a social studies credit. Activities and clubs Turkey Day game vs Kirkwood at Moss Field. Students may organize their own clubs as long as they are accompanied by a faculty sponsor and chartered by the student council. Sports Webster Groves High School sponsors a number of different sports, including football (men's), field hockey, soccer (men's and women's), basketball (men's and women's), baseball (men's), softball (women's), golf (men's and women's), track and field (men's and women's), swimming (men's and women's), and lacrosse (women's). Ice hockey and men's lacrosse are non-affiliate sports at the high school. Turkey Day game. The Turkey Day football game is an annual game held on Thanksgiving Day between Webster Groves High School and its longtime rival, Kirkwood High School. The rivalry between the two schools is the oldest current Thanksgiving Day rivalry west of the Mississippi River. The location of the game alternates each year between Webster’s Moss Field and Kirkwood’s Lyon’s Memorial field. A number of festivities surround the game, including a shared dance and a separate bonfire and pep rally at each school. 2007 was the 100th year of this storied series between the two schools, and the game had attendance exceeding 12,000 fans. =State championship wins= *1931: Boys Track *1947: Boys Golf *1951: Boys Golf *1954: Boys Golf *1954: Football *1967: Boys Swimming *1968: Boys Swimming *1970: Boys Swimming *1979: Football *1983: Girls Golf *1984: Girls Golf *1988: Football *1996: Boys Basketball *2002: Football *2008: Boys Basketball; Ranked 18th in the Nation *2009: Football; Ranked 7th in the Midwest/Midlands Region *2014: Boys Soccer; first ever in school history *2015: Boys Soccer; first public school to win twice in a row *2017: Boys Basketball *2017: Girls Soccer; first ever in school history *2018: Boys Basketball Media references In 1966 CBS produced an award winning documentary called 16 In Webster Groves, which was about the lives of students in Webster Groves.

Operated by the General Services Administration, it was designed by architect Paul Philippe Cret in 1933. At the time of its construction it was the largest such heating facility in the United States and served 22 federal buildings. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Cret used Art Deco styling for the essentially industrial building, a departure from the prevailing Washington classicism, but was able to integrate it with its surroundings through careful massing and detailing. Pilasters and vertical ribbons of windows stand in for classical colonnades. Cret designed the roof profile so that the plant's smokestacks did not project above the equipment screen, satisfying the concerns of the District of Columbia Commission on Fine Arts, which had jurisdiction over the design. The three octagonal smokestacks rise only . Limestone relief panels illustrate the building's purpose with depictions of a boiler, safety valve, generator, fan and heat exchanger. The building is noteworthy as an early example of Modernism-influenced architecture, and as a notably attractive building in its own right. Originally designed to burn coal, the Central Heating Plant has been converted to use oil and natural gas. A central refrigeration plant constructed in 1957 obscures the east elevation.

Hawley was the great grandson of Joseph Hawley (Captain) of Stratford, Connecticut, through Samuel. A drawing and description of the house was included in J. Frederick Kelly's book, The Early Domestic Architecture of Connecticut first published in 1924. Thomas and Sarah Hawley The Thomas Hawley house is a rare survivor from the earliest era of Stepney's settlement.Stepney Heritage Trail Guide retrieved on 2009-05-11 It is also a reminder that until the mid-20th century, most residents made their living by farming. Present day Stepney or Monroe, was originally the northern part of Stratford, which had been settled in 1639. In the early 18th century, descendants of Stratford's original settlers, Thomas Hawley among them, carved out farms out of the wilderness. Thomas Hawley was the great grandson of Joseph Hawley, one of the original settlers of Stratford, Connecticut who purchased most of the present town of Monroe from the Paugusset Indians in 1671. Thomas was born on September 8, 1734 in present-day Trumbull, Connecticut, married Sarah Olcott on November 16, 1760 and raised ten children. Hawley Genealogy, Elias Hawley, 1890, website retrieved on 2009-05-11 New Stratford In 1761, 48 men from North Stratford, including Thomas Hawley, submitted a petition to the Connecticut General Court for permission to form their own religious parish.Colonial Connecticut Records Vol. 11 page 595 The nearest meetinghouse, as Congregationalists called their house of worship, was more than three miles (5 km) away. This made it difficult for residents of North Stratford to comply with the Connecticut law requiring everyone to attend all-day worship services on the Sabbath. The Connecticut General Court granted their request, and in 1762 created the New Stratford Ecclesiastical Society. Colonial Connecticut Records Vol. 12 pages 48–50 In 1823, this society incorporated as the Town of Monroe. Building Rear view catslide roof The house, a pre-revolutionary saltbox dwelling, is two and one-half stories high and three bays wide with a side gable roof; center entrance, and center fieldstone chimney. Its dimensions are approximately 37 by . The roof pitch is 45 degrees in the main portion, lessening to 30 degrees in the kitchen appendage, a probable indication that this was added at later date. The exterior is clapboard, painted a dark red color. The roof is a natural wood shingle. Window sash is 9-over-6 on the first floor and 6-over-6 on the second, and 9-panel single hung in the attic. None of the early farm outbuildings survive. There are no surface remnants of a barn and slave house mentioned in an early 19th-century estate inventory. Revolutionary War Captain Thomas Hawley played a role on the home front in the war for American independence.CTGENWEB Fairfield County website retrieved on 2009-05-12 He is believed to have served on the Committee of Inspection appointed in 1776 to “keep watch and ward” in Stratford, of which Monroe was then still part, and which bordered the vulnerable Long Island coast. Later years Records show that as late as 1800, Thomas Hawley owned two slaves. Slavery had existed on a small scale in Connecticut since the 17th century, but never took root and flourished here as it did in the South. By 1800 the vast majority of the state's black residents were freed. They had been manumitted (or freed) by their owners, bought their own freedom, or been liberated by a law designed to gradually eliminate slavery in Connecticut. By 1810 Thomas Hawley no longer owned slaves. Thomas Hawley died in 1817 at the age of 83, leaving nearly of land. An inventory of Thomas Hawley's estate at the time of his death shows a house valued at $160.00, a slave house at $10.00, and a barn at $130.00. David Hawley was the beneficiary of his father's estate. His descendants lived in his house for another century. In the 1920s, F. William Behrens, mayor of Bridgeport from 1923 to 1929, purchased the Thomas Hawley house as a summer home.

For most of this time, the primary focus of the association's activities has been encouraging physicians to assume more active roles in the leadership and management of organizations in the health care industry and helping physicians acquire leadership and management skills. In 1982, AAMD moved its headquarters to Tampa. In 1980, the name was changed to the American College of Physician Executives (ACPE) to more accurately reflect the nature and direction of its growing membership. In 2014, after more than a year of preparation including member surveys and workshops, the organization rebranded and became the American Association for Physician Leadership. By broadening the scope of programs, products and services, the association strives to more fully support the physician workforce across the entire career span, from medical students to those in later career stages.

It was previously considered a subspecies of the common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). This species occurs in Africa, from northwestern Angola and southern Democratic Republic of Congo to southern Tanzania, and south to South Africa.  Description  A slender, medium-sized kestrel, between 30 and 33 centimeters tall. Adult male kestrels weigh between 183g and 254g, while females weigh between 190g and 280g.  Distribution and habitat  The species occurs from Angola, south through the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as Tanzania, further south to South Africa, and in most of the places between. Noticeable places of scarcity include north and north east Namibia, Botswana, south Mozambique and tropical Lowveld, while in Zimbabwe it is restricted to high-lying central and eastern regions. The kestrel is usually associated with arid areas, but may also be found in open and/or semi-arid areas.  Behavior  Diet, feeding and call = Rock kestrels feed on a wide variety of organisms. They eat primarily invertebrates, but have been known to consume rodents, reptiles and birds. Two primary forms of hunting are employed: hover hunting and perch hunting. Hover hunting describes the method whereby the kestrel remains stationary in the air with minimal wing flapping by utilizing updrafts. Hover hunting generally happens at medium to high windspeeds. It is usually small prey (such as insects) which are caught via this method, and are subsequently eaten during flight. Perch hunting is when the kestrel utilizes either natural (for instance cliffs and trees) or artificial (for instance electricity pylons and telephone poles) perches to scan the surrounding area for prey. Rock kestrels have been observed following baboons through grasslands and catching the insect species flushed out. There are also reports of rock kestrels robbing nests for young birds and eating termites on the floor. Their call is a harsh chay-chay-chay, especially when scaring off intruders, unlike the common kestrel's kee-kee-kee. = Breeding = Rock kestrels usually nest in either old stick nests or on cliffs, where they may make a depression in the sand. They have also been observed utilizing buildings, but this appears to be unusual. Clutch sizes vary between 1 and 6 eggs. The female incubates the eggs full-time while the male sources food. After 26 to 32 days the chicks hatch. Chicks will remain in the nest for a further 31 to 39 days post hatching. Thereafter they leave the nest, but often remain in the vicinity for several weeks. Breeding density varies across habitats however a study in Namibia noted values of between 19.1 and 28.9 pairs per 100 square kilometers.  Status and conservation  The rock kestrel is common in many protected areas, and as a result is not threatened.

He was promoted to able seaman; however, his real task as arranged between Joseph Banks and Cook was to collect as many botanical specimens as possible for the Royal Gardens, as Cook, who had failed to attract an established botanist to the position. He received a small amount of botanical training and instruction from Banks and William Aiton before embarking. During the voyage, he also made a significant collection of native Hawaiian birds, which is now housed in the British Museum. On returning to London in 1780, he worked as a gardener at Kew Gardens for seven years, before Banks arranged his appointment as botanist to Bligh's voyage to Tahiti to obtain breadfruit trees. Nelson had control of the Great Cabin and 1015 potted breadfruit trees which were intended for the West Indies. He was caught up in the mutiny and, remaining loyal to the captain, was one of the 19 men cast adrift in a small boat. He survived the famous 3800-mile voyage to Timor, but a few days after arriving in Kupang, died of a fever. Bligh would later name Mount Nelson, Tasmania in his honor.

Plot In 1943, Allied forces stationed in the Middle East commission a team of commandos led by Nikitas (Nikos Dadinopoulos) to destroy the largest German military airport in occupied Crete. Nikitas is a Cretan himself and the son of a drunkard Nazi collaborator (Dimos Starenios). He is in love with Martha (Miranta Kounelaki), a local villager. The commandos seek the assistance of the resistance, led by Lefteris (Lakis Komninos), who is also in love with Martha. While initially willing to cooperate, Lefteris changes his mind and refuses to help the team in their operation, believing it to be a suicide mission. Without the help of the resistance, the commando's mission is a failure. Meanwhile, after the resistance blows up a bridge, the Germans arrest Martha and Lefteris' father in an attempt to force Lefteris to turn himself in.

The person directing traffic is responsible for maintaining the safety and efficiency of traffic, as well as the safety of road workers, while allowing construction, accident recovery or other tasks to proceed. Traffic guards are commonly used to control traffic when two way roads are reduced to one lane, and traffic must alternate. Their duties are to direct traffic to safer areas where construction or traffic incidents are taking place. In addition they have to moderate the traffic density to not cause traffic jams. They guide motorists to follow the traffic laws; but may not be able to enforce the law. Most traffic guards are seen as construction workers; but in some nations, they dress or perform as security guards and police officers. Duties and careers ;Highway and expressway safety Traffic guards are employed on highways and expressways. They are trained to set up warning signs and barricades to slow down the speed of traffic in a temporary traffic control zone. Some areas have full-time traffic guard teams for responding to incidents that could risk the safety to motorists. When they are on scene they will set up equipment to warn approaching traffic about the incident. ;Intersections If construction or maintenance is occurring in an intersection and a law enforcement officer is not used to direct traffic, a traffic guard would control the intersection instead of the traffic light or signs. ;Road construction M-124, Hayes State Park, Michigan Traffic guards who are directing traffic during road construction often alternate opposing traffic through a single lane.

The forest covers approx 12,500 hectares of the Te Korowai-o-Te-Tonga Peninsula, from Muriwai in the south to South Head in the north. The forest is a popular location for a number of recreation activities, including horse riding, 4WD and trail biking, mountain biking, paintball, tree climbing adventures (confidence and team building), orienteering and filming, although all require a permit (paid), and walking or dog walking is no longer supported by the owners. Woodhill Forest is a sand-based pine forest, providing all weather trails and recreation. Woodhill Forest is also notorious as a site where several bodies have been found dumped or buried.  History  Originally the coastal land was covered in native vegetation, but the arrival of British and their farm animals led to severe erosion. In the 1870s sheep and cattle grazing had already begun to cause problems in many coastal areas. By 1873 James Stewart reported fully grown trees buried by dunes and in the Kaipara dunes of 90 metres tall.McKelvey, P. Sand Forests: A historical perspective of the stabilisation and afforestation of coastal sands in New Zealand. Just a few years damage could transform an area from bush to desert. The first NZ Forest Act of 1874Early Forest Legislation http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/F/Forestry/EarlyForestLegislation/en was largely in response to concern about the increase in coastal dune invasions.Pre 1870 Forest Development http://www.maf.govt.nz/forestry/publications/impact-of- incentives-on-plantation-forest-resources/plantation-forest-resources-03.htm However, little was actually done. In 1880 the area of coastal drifting sands was 46,000 hectares, by 1909 it had grown to 120,000 hectares. In 1903 the Sand Drift Act was introduced, but it wasn't until 1913 that the Public Works Dept made its first efforts in sand stabilisation. By 1924 only 65 hectares of marram had been planted at Woodhill. With the problem increasing each year, the great depression came to the rescue of the New Zealand coastline and lands. The Public Works Dept administered the unemployment relief fund, with 80,000 registered unemployed at their disposal they set them to work on sand stabilisation projects around the country. In 1932 planting of marram grasses began in earnest, with lupins and eventually pine seedlings following. In Woodhill, there were 4 camps of 20-30 men per camp working all year round, with supplies being brought in from neighbouring farms and plants supplied from a nursery also in what was then a barren wasteland of sand dunes. The real pioneer was A.A.Restall, the highly successful Forest Manager at Woodhill, who introduced machinery and processes that lifted the amount of planting to levels that turned the tide of sand encroachment at Woodhill. Restall's created best practice for other sand reclamation projects around New Zealand, and around the world.Restall, A.A. Sand dune reclamation on Woodhill Forest In the 1980s Woodhill Forest was one of many New Zealand Forest Service forests to be privatised as part of the Rogernomics asset sales program, and became a Licensed Crown Forest. Walking access by the public was still supported, however other activities were not except as permitted by the licensee. This began the commercialisation of recreation in the forest. In 2014 the Treaty of Waitangi claim by Ngati Whatua o Kaipara\\"Ngati Whatua o Kaipara \\" Official Iwi website was finally settled. The treaty settlement has enabled Ngati Whatua o Kaipara the opportunity to purchase Woodhill Forest from the Crown. Ngati Whatua now manage recreational areas and other activities in Woodhill Forest. Hancock Forest Management retain a license for tree felling for the next 35 years under the Crown Forest Licence conditions (a gradual return to Ngati Whatua as felling occurs). All recreation in the forest, whether organised events, or regular recreation is now commercial, and walking access is no longer supported by the owners.

Gilmore, 372 U.S. 39 (1963), was a federal income tax case before the United States Supreme Court.  Background  In the course of a hotly contested divorce, the taxpayer had incurred substantial legal fees in defending against his wife's claim to ownership of a controlling interest in the family business. Had she succeeded, his principal source of livelihood—his salary as chief executive—might be jeopardized. Accordingly, he sought to deduct some of these fees for the \\"conservation ... of property held for the production of income.\\"  Opinion of the Court  Following its earlier decision in Lykes v. United States, the Supreme Court sustained the Commissioner in disallowing the deduction as a \\"family\\" expense under § 262. The Court reasoned that the deductibility of legal fees depends upon the origin of the litigated claim rather than upon the potential consequences of success or failure to the taxpayer's income status. Since the origin of the litigation was to be found in the taxpayer's marital difficulties, no deduction was allowable. From the Syllabus: :The Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Harlan, held that origin and character of claim with respect to which expense was incurred, rather than its potential consequences upon fortunes of taxpayer, is controlling basic test of whether expense was ‘business' or ‘personal’ and, hence, whether it is deductible as expense incurred for conservation of property held for production of income.

The movie was filmed in New Hampshire'Killer Pickton' movie already made and was directed by Ulli Lommel. The movie was co-produced and co-written by Ulli Lommel and Jeff Frentzen. Frentzen portrayed the killer, herein called \\"Billy Pickton\\", using the stage name Curtis Graan. Killer Pickton became controversial when its planned 2006 release in Australia was delayed when the government of Canada put pressure on the Australian distributor, Peacock Films Ltd., to pull the movie from its release schedule for legal reasons—Canada's ban on publishing details of the alleged crimes prior to Pickton's trial was cited.Peacock Films DVD release announcement The movie was later released in Australia after Pickton was convicted of murder,Pickton guilty on 6 counts of second-degree murder and remains listed in the distributor's catalog. Although Lions Gate Entertainment had acquired Killer Pickton for DVD release in North America and marketing materials were created for the release,DVD cover art by Lions Gate Entertainment it remains unavailable in North America due to the legal problems of distributing the movie in Canada. Plot Billy Pickton (Curtis Graan) is with his attorney (Christian Behm) in a police interrogation room, about to be questioned by a police detective (Michael Barbour) and district attorney (Rachael Devlin). As the detective and district attorney converse about Billy's case, the movie is told in flashback. Billy is shown running a severed pig's head and hoofs up and down the body of a prostitute (Jacqueline Horrell), in a strangely sexual sequence, as the detective narrates. Billy's modus operandi of luring prostitutes to his sister's expensive home to drug and kill them is shown in a series of episodes. His first victim (Lauren Kruskall) is drowned in a bath tub, placed in a large wheeled trash can, taken to the family pig farm, and fed into a woodchipper. The remaining episodes follow a similar pattern. The next victim, played by Kate Hackett, is drugged and abused in one of the bedrooms of Billy's sister's house. The abuse is interrupted by a housekeeper (Marilyn Cortez), who quietly observes Billy move the drugged woman into a trash can and wheel her to the pig farm. There, he suffocates her and feeds her hand into a meat grinder. Billy forces alcohol down the throat of the next victim (Jillian Swanson). He drags the incapacitated woman around the house, up the stairs, forcing her to swallow pills before killing her. She is later fed to the woodchipper. Throughout the film, the detective implies and then finally accuses Billy of mixing the remains of the victims with pork meat that was then sold to a national food market chain for public consumption. In flashback dinner scenes with his sister (Jill Pennington) and brother (Frank Godek), Billy does not answer questions about why the pork products \\"taste so good.\\" After the next victim (Anjeannete Stairs) is strangled and buried alive, Billy is interrupted by three teenage hitch hikers, one of whom he treats for a spider bite before sending them on their way, unharmed. Billy narrates how his mother made an audio recording of his father's (Carsten Frank) death, which forever colored his view of women as \\"evil whores.\\" There is a brief flashback of Billy dancing and frolicking with a prostitute (Nicole Polec), and attending church. Billy's next victim, Annie (Heidi Rhodes), is treated to a tour of the house attic, and their relationship starts to take a bizarre romantic tone. She reads an Edgar Allan Poe poem to Billy before he drugs her—she wants him to kill her. However, he cannot bring himself to feed Annie to the woodchipper, because as the detective intones, \\"She was the only woman he ever cared for.\\" In the pig farm basement, the brother discovers Billy and Annie's corpse, which leads to Billy's arrest. The movie ends with title cards that explain that Billy may have killed \\"as many as 135 ... unfortunate women.\\" Filming Production of Killer Pickton took place during July 2005 at the home of producer Jeff Frentzen, in Windham, New Hampshire, and at the McCauslin Farm in Weare, New Hampshire. The church scene was filmed in Goffstown, New Hampshire. Scenes of Billy's father dying were filmed in Heidenheim, Germany in the fall of 2005. In an interview, actress Jillian Swanson has stated that in one scene she was tied to an attic ladder, crying and begging. \\"It really is incredibly draining when you go home with that feeling still with you,\\" she said. Co-producer and co-writer Jeff Frentzen agreed to play the killer after he and director Ulli Lommel were unable to locate a suitable actor in New Hampshire and Massachusetts to play the part. One of the teenage hitchhikers was portrayed by producer Jeff Frentzen's son.

He systematically collected the folk music of his native country, and many of his folk melody arrangements have since become part of the permanent repertoire of Estonian choral societies. He was the first Estonian collector to use the phonograph for this purpose and the harmonisations he made became a lifelong preoccupation. His beautiful psalm settings have an unmistakable folk tinge, and yet they are much more than simple folksong arrangements, with their carefully graded choral colouring and passing use of imitation. Kreek's magnum opus was his Requiem, using an Estonian translation of the text of Mozart's Requiem, but his essence is perfectly expressed in these choral miniatures. Cyrillus Kreek also achieved renown as an instrumental composer with his Musica sacra, a Humoreske for orchestra, and a Suite for zithers and orchestra.

Blue Duck, sometimes referred to as Bluford Duck, (1858 – 1895) was an outlaw of the Old West, probably best known for a photograph taken of him around the mid-1880s, in which he posed with Belle Starr, a famous Old West female outlaw. Biography Duck was born in the Cherokee Nation, with the name of Sha-con-gah. By the early 1870s he was riding with gangs across the Oklahoma Territory committing armed robberies and acts of cattle rustling. Blue Duck became involved romantically with Belle Starr along that time. When she married outlaw Sam Starr, she and her husband formed their own gang, which Blue Duck joined. He is believed to have ridden with that gang through most of the latter part of the 1870s, although his involvement with them was off and on. On June 23, 1884, while riding drunk in the Flint District of the Cherokee Nation, and in the company of outlaw William Christie, the two men came upon a farmer named Samuel Wyrick. For no apparent reason, the two outlaws opened fire on the farmer, emptying their revolvers into him, killing him. They then reloaded and fired on a young Cherokee boy who'd witnessed the murder, missing him but shooting his horse from beneath him. Both Blue Duck and Christie were captured by Deputy US Marshal Frank Cochran, and taken before Judge Isaac Parker, known as the \\"Hanging Judge\\", in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Both were convicted, although Christie was later cleared of the charge and released. Blue Duck was sentenced to hang, but later his sentence was reduced to life in prison. He was sent to Menard Penitentiary in Chester, Illinois as Inmate # 2486. Blue Duck was assisted in an unsuccessful appeal by Belle Starr. In 1895, when he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and given only a short time to live, he was granted a pardon and released. He died shortly thereafter in Catoosa, Oklahoma, where he is buried.

The egg was made for Nicholas II of Russia, who presented it to his mother, the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna on Easter 1898. Design The egg was created by Faberge's workmaster, Mikhail Evlampievich Perkhin (Russian, 1860-1903) with miniatures by Johannes Zehngraf (Danish, 1857-1908) and is made of red gold, diamonds, pearls, gray, pink and opalescent blue enamel and watercolor on ivory. The stand is made of varicolored gold and the egg itself unfolds into a screen of eight ivory miniatures. The egg is one of the few Faberge eggs that is not enameled over most of its surface. It is made of engraved red gold in the Empire style, surmounted by a pelican in opalescent gray, blue and pink enamel. The pelican is feeding her young in the nest, a symbol of maternal care. The egg is engraved with classical motifs, the commemorative dates 1797–1897, and the inscription \\"Visit our vineyards, O Lord, and we shall dwell in thee.\\" The egg is supported on a varicolored gold, four-legged stand and retains its original red velvet case, the only time this color was used for a Tsar Imperial Easter Egg-case. Surprise The egg contains eight oval miniature paintings of charitable institutions patronized by the Dowager Empress: the Xenia Institute, the Nikolai Orphanage, the Patriotic Institute, the Smolny Institute, the Ekaterina Institute, the Pavel Institute, the St. Petersburg Orphanage of Nikolai, and the Elizabeth Institute. The institutions, founded mainly for the education of the daughters of the nobility, are depicted on an extending folding screen of eight ivory panels, each within a pearl border. The miniatures are painted by court miniaturist Johannes Zehngraf. On the back of each is written the name of the institution portrayed. The ninth \\"panel\\" is a stand for the other eight. History Because of the dates \\"1797 and 1897\\" on the Egg, for many years the Pelican Egg was ascribed to 1897, but when the original Fabergé invoice was found it showed that this Egg was presented to Maria Feodorovna for Easter 1898. In 1930, the Imperial Pelican Fabergé egg, with the eight oval miniatures, was one of ten Imperial eggs sold by the Antikvariat to Armand Hammer in New York City. Hammer showed the egg along with other Russian treasures at department stores all across the United States. Between 1936 and 1938 it was purchased by Lillian Thomas Pratt, the wife of John Lee Pratt, from Hammer Galleries. Mrs. Pratt willed the Egg to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia, upon her death in 1947. It remains on view as part of the Virginia Museum of Fine Art's European Decorative Art collection.

Planning and construction Fishing boats were not the only ones to cross the Vieques Passage, but also ocean-going ships. In fact, the expanse of water between Cabras Island and Vieques had become an important passway during the long duration of the Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico. So, when in 1869 Madrid approved the lighthouse's construction on Cabras Island, few questioned its wisdom. The initiative was not an isolated event, but part of an island-wide modernization project for \\"maritime illumination\\" (es: \\"Plan de Alumbrado Maritimo en la Isla de Puerto Rico\\"). Puerto Rico's coasts were coming into the light with the establishment of fourteen lighthouses of which the Cabras Island Light was the twelfth in line. At its roots, the project responded to unprecedented political pressure. Accusations against the Crown of abandonment and military upheavals of which the Grito de Lares (\\"Lares Cry\\" or \\"Lares Uprising\\") was only the best known, marked the year 1868. The following decade saw in Puerto Rico the formation of political parties, the abolition of slavery and environmental legislations like the act to protect the Yunque, among the oldest U.S. National Parks. Though the increasingly liberal local government showed signs of life and interest in developing the island's infrastructure, the overstretched Spanish Empire, embroiled in wars for independence in Cuba and the Philippines, neglected the construction of the Cabras Island Light. In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, the U.S. fleet maneuvered near the Cabras Island, learning first hand the value of its position between the bays of Bahía de Puerca and Ensenada Honda. Soon after replacing the Puerto Rican autonomous government with a military regime, the U.S. picked up the light project as part of its naval expansion in the Caribbean area. In 1904, the U.S. Coast Guard purchased the of land for $200, and by May 13, 1908, the lighthouse was ready for service. The cost of the undertaking, including the entrance road and the pier, reached a total of $5654.55. Structure The lighthouse building was unique among the lighthouses in Puerto Rico in that it resembled the rectangular shape and design of the better-known light in the Morro, but with the castle's stone structure. Differently from its San Juan relative, the building overseeing the Vieques Passage was a small two-story lightgray stone daymark structure with a red stripe and a clear white trim. Its black lantern room sat on a small cylindrical tower on of its corners at the top of the building. It stood 78 feet off the ground, and projected a white light visible all around, showing higher intensity on range line for nine miles away (some even say 14). Its original lens was a sixth-order Fresnel lens. Employment A keeper managed the light and occupied the building's two rooms. As the islands of Culebra and Vieques became both military posts and tourists destinations, the lighthouse played a role in safeguarding the increasing number of trips across the passage. Traveler's accounts refer to its beauty and powerful light over the waters. In 1937, as part of the changes that Gustaf Dalén affected in the gas and lighthouse technologies, the authorities installed an automated acetylene torch. Six years later, the building was closed and boarded. In 1965 the light was replaced with a range light called \\"Vieques Southwest Channel Range Front Light\\". The original structure was destroyed in 1966. Setting Cabras Island is located in the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The small island separates the entrance of Puerca Bay, a small open-mouth bay and the Ensenada Honda harbor. The island is connected to the mainland by a causeway.

June 28, 1246) was a Kurdish ruler, the emir (\\"governor\\") of the Homs principality from 1240 to 1246 under the Ayyubid dynasty. He held Homs with relative independence, but initially he was under the command of as-Salih Ismail of Damascus. He would later fight against as- Salih Ismail and his Khwarezemid allies—al-Mansur confronted the latter in 1241, 1242, 1244, and 1246. Military campaigns In January 1241, al-Mansur was appointed commander-in-chief of the allied Ayyubid-Seljuk forces, and pursued any Khwarezimid army that crossed the Euphrates, pillaging several Syrian towns. Al-Mansur caught up with them at Raqqa, but could not prevent them from retreating back to their base in Harran to regroup. On April 25, al- Mansur managed to draw the Khwarezemids into a pitched battle near Edessa and defeated them decisively. Surviving Khwarezemid soldiers fled to Harran where they gathered their families and moved south to territory controlled by the Abbasid Caliphate. Most of the captured territory was taken by the Ayyubids of Aleppo and the Seljuks, but al-Mansur annexed al-Khabur and Qarqisiyya to his own principality. He joined forces with the Seljuk army and together they overwhelmed the fortress of Amid held by the sultan as-Salih Ayyub who attempted to hold Syria and al-Jazira for his Ayyubid Egypt. In al-Mansur's campaign, all of Ayyub's possessions, except for Hisn Kayfa, were taken.Humphreys, 1977, pp.270-271. In August 1242, al-Mansur again defeated a Khwarezemid expeditionary force in the Aleppo area. In 1243, as-Salih Ayyub attempted to secure a peace agreement with as-Salih Ismail establishing an- Nasir Dawud who held Transjordan as the common enemy, and thus al-Mansur was required to recognize the former as sultan. As-Salih Ismail sent him to besiege an-Nasir's fortress at Ajlun.Hawting, 2005, p.242. In 1244, Egypt and Syria again broke ties, and al-Mansur joined as-Salih Ismail's federation. They advanced towards Egypt, with as-Salih Ismail heading for Gaza, an-Nasir Dawud for Jerusalem, while al-Mansur proceeded towards Acre. Before al-Mansur reached the city, the Khwarezemids again crossed the Euphrates into Ayyubid territory. Al-Mansur left to fight them, but in the resulting Battle of La Forbie his army was overwhelmed and he narrowly escaped with a few followers.Humphreys, 1977, pp.276. The Khwarezemids, with the aid of Izz al- Din of Salkhad besieged Damascus in March 1246 and were joined by as-Salih Ismail who now held Baalbek. The siege was so severe that the inhabitants were reported to have been feeding on carrion and dogs. However, al-Mansur and an- Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo made an alliance and decided to confront the Khwarwezmids, who they feared could take control of Syria should they seize Damascus. The prospect troubled al-Mansur especially since relieving Damascus would strengthen the grip of his enemy as-Salih Ayyub in southern Syria. Nonetheless, al-Mansur led a force of Turkmen and Bedouin mercenaries towards Damascus. The Khwarezemids and their allies met al-Mansur near Lake Homs where they were dealt a major defeat, ending Khwarezemid power in Syria forever. Afterward, al-Mansur moved on to Baalbek which was defended by as-Salih Ismail's son al-Manssur Mahmud. Al-Mansur Ibrahim overran the outer town with ease, but retreated after reaching its formidable citadel and returned to Homs.Humphreys, 1977, pp.286-287. Death At this point, as-Salih Ayyub invited al-Mansur to Egypt, possibly pursuant to an agreement granting him Damascus. He did not hesitate to accept the invitation, but by the time he reached Damascus he was reported to be gravely ill. He died in the Ghouta town of Nayrab on June 28, 1246 and was succeeded by his son al-Ashraf Musa. Under al-Mansur, Homs, the smallest Ayyubid principality, wielded great influence in imperial affairs, but with his demise, it returned to its accustomed passivity.Humphreys, 1977, p.288.

It probably played a part in evolving modern chess out of Medieval Chess. The game was subsequently replaced by a more modern form. Rules Courier Chess is played on an 8x12 board, that is, 8 ranks by 12 files. Literary and artistic evidence indicate that the board had always been checkered, but that there was no consistency as to which squares were light and which squares were dark. The more frequent pattern is that the square at the bottom right corner was light, just as in modern chess. The winning objective is the same as western chess, to checkmate the opponent's king. The stalemate rule is unknown; the subject was unsettled in Germany deep into the nineteenth century. * The kings start on squares of their own color, at f1 and f8. Just as in western chess, the king moves one square in any direction, and a player can't place their own king in check. There is no castling. * Next to the king, on e1 and e8, stands the sage or Mann, which moves just like the king, but can be captured. The website http://courierchess.com has information about the history of Courier chess, including a large image of Lucas van Leyden's painting. * On the other central file, at g1 and g8, stands the ferz, or queen, which moves one square diagonally. * On the queen's other side, at h1 and h8, stands a piece known as the schleich (or thief, jester, smuggler, spy, or trull, sometimes depicted as a jester) moving one square orthogonally: the move of the wazir. * At d1, i1, d8, and i8 stands the piece that gave the game its name: the läufer, or courier or runner. It moves like the modern chess bishop, any number of squares diagonally. * Next, at c1, j1, c8, and j8, stands the bishop, or archer. It moves as the alfil, two squares diagonally, leaping the first square. * At b1, k1, b8, and k8 stands the knight, which moves just like the modern chess knight: one square orthogonally, followed by one square diagonally, leaping the squares. *In the corners, at a1, l1, a8, and l8 stands the rook.Bell 1960, 1979, p. 62., which moves the same as its modern chess counterpart: any number of squares orthogonally. * The second rank for each player is filled with pawns, which, like modern chess pawns, move one square forward and capture one square diagonally forward. Unlike in modern chess, pawns can't double advance on their first move, therefore the en passant rule does not apply. The pawn promotion rule is that a pawn reaching the furthest rank is promoted to a queen (ferz).Bell 1960, 1979, p. 63. The old rule for first moves is that at the start of the game each player must move his rook pawns, his queen pawn, and his queen two squares forward (see top diagram). Such a two-square leap along a file was called a joyleap. Murray 1913, p. 438. History Wirnt von Gravenberg, writing early in the thirteenth century, mentioned the Courier Game in his poem Wigalois, and expected his readers to know what he was talking about. Heinrich von Beringen, about a hundred years later, mentioned the introduction of the couriers as an improvement in chess. Kunrat von Ammenhausen, still in the first half of the fourteenth century, told how he had once in Constance seen a game with sixteen more men than in the \\"right chess\\": each side having a trull, two couriers, a counsellor, and four extra pawns. He added that he had never seen the game anywhere else, in Provence, France, or Kurwalhen.Murray 1913, pp. 483-84. Sometime shortly after 1475 someone put the courier on the standard chessboard in place of the old alfil and gave the queen the combined powers of the courier and the rook.Murray 1913, pp. 776-77; Eales 1985, p. 72. This game was so much more exciting than medieval chess that it soon drove the older game off the market.Murray 1913, Chapter XI. Other improvements were tried out. One was an optional double first step for the pawns. This was at first restricted to the king's, queen's, and rooks' pawns, and then gradually extended to the others.Murray 1913, p. 852. In the early sixteenth century Lucas van Leyden, in the Netherlands, painted a picture called The Chess Players in which a woman appears to be beating a man at Courier Chess.Murray 1913, p. 484. \\"A painting in the Königliches Museum, Berlin, said to have been painted in 1520 by Lucus von Leyden, shows a game of Courier in progress.\\" Gustavus Selenus (Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg) in his 1616 book Das Schach- oder Königs-Spiel, mentioned the Courier Game as one of three forms of chess played in the village of Ströbeck near Halberstadt in Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany. He described it in detail, and gave drawings of the pieces. The names he gave the pieces do not always match the figures in the drawings: the piece called the Schleich is depicted as a court jester. In 1651 Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, gave to Ströbeck a playing board with chess on one side and the Courier Game on the other, and a set of silver pieces. These pieces were lent in the eighteenth century and never returned, but there is a set of wooden pieces. In 1821 H. G. Albers reported that Courier Chess was still played in Ströbeck, and that some pieces had gained more powerful moves, but a few years later other visitors found that it had been abandoned. In 1883 the local chess club revived it. Playing sets based on Lucas van Leyden's painting are commercially available. man (or sage), and jester. The Chess Players by Lucas van Leyden (c. 1520) Modern rules Albers attempted to popularize the game in Germany in 1821 with updated rules. The starting setup is the same as for medieval Courier Chess. The king, queen, courier (bishop), knight, and rook have their modern powers. The bishop (or archer) can move one square diagonally, or leap diagonally to the second square. The fool, standing beside the queen, moves one square in any direction. The sage, standing beside the king, combines the powers of the fool and the knight. The pawn moves like the modern pawn, except that after reaching the farthest rank it must remain there for two moves before taking up its new career as a piece. Castling is permitted, if all squares between the king and the rook are vacant, the king has not been checked, the rook is not en prise, neither has moved, and no square between them is under attack. The king moves to the bishop's square, and the rook leaps over him to the courier's square, in either wing.Verney, p. 154. The rule on stalemate has not been preserved; the subject was unsettled in Germany well into the nineteenth century.Murray 1913, p. 853. Subsequent attempts to modernize Courier Chess include Modern Courier Chess (Paul Byway, starting 1971). An attempt has recently been made to make this game fully compatible with FIDE modern conventions: Reformed Courier- Spiel (Clément Begnis, 2011).

Its members comprise the Washington elite, including presidents, senators, and diplomats, among other prominent figures. History In 1884, seven Washingtonians founded the Alibi Club, a private social club consisting of prominent political and social figures. Its name derived from the club practice of providing an alibi when the whereabouts of a member was questioned by the member's family. The club's founding purpose was to foster \\"mutual improvement, education, and enlightenment\\" among members of Washington society. Membership also extended to out of town figures from New York City, Boston and Philadelphia, most likely to share information between communities and help in the development of strategies to address civic issues. Throughout its history, it has hosted numerous world leaders, including King Leopold of Belgium, Prince Albert of Belgium, Prince Henry of Prussia, and Viceroy Li Hung Chang. =Clubhouse= The first clubhouse was situated at 17th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. Since 1886, the club has occupied a three-story, brick townhouse blocks away from the White House. The clubhouse is furnished with donated memorabilia and artifacts that cover nearly every available section of wall on the first two floors. The clubhouse is also notable as a well-preserved example of residential architecture in a commercial district, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 21, 1994. In 2018 the building was listed as a vacant property. Membership Membership is limited to fifty, with new members admitted upon unanimous vote after the death of a previous member. Membership is not revealed to outsiders, and the first public notice of membership is often in a member's obituary. Some of the Alibi Club's most prominent members have included: President George H.W. Bush, his father, Senator Prescott Bush, Supreme Court Justices Potter Stewart and Stanley F. Reed, Allen Dulles and John Foster Dulles, Speaker of the House Nicholas Longworth, and General George C. Marshall. *David M.

She was built as SS Standard Arrow for the Standard Oil Company. In World War II, she was again acquired by the U.S. Navy from Standard Oil and commissioned as USS Signal (IX-142) a station tanker in the Pacific from 1944 to 1946. Construction, acquisition, and commissioning SS Standard Arrow was built as a commercial tanker in 1916 at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Company for the Standard Transportation Company of New York City. The U.S. Navy acquired Standard Arrow from Standard Transportation under a bareboat charter on 22 August 1917 for use during World War I. She was assigned the Naval Registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1532 and commissioned as USS Standard Arrow the same day at Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California. United States Navy service as USS Standard Arrow, 1917-1919 Standard Arrow was on a voyage from Devonport, England, to New York City when the Naval Overseas Transportation Service was established on 9 January 1918 and she was assigned to it. She arrived at New York on 19 January 1918 and was refitted for Navy duty. She then loaded a cargo of fuel oil and departed New York for Devonport on 4 February 1918. However, she collided with the tanker that day, damaged her steering gear, and sprang a leak in her forward hold. She returned to port, discharged her cargo to tanker USS Maumee (AO-2), and was drydocked until 25 February 1918. Standard Arrow then replenished her cargo and sailed with a convoy for England, arriving at Portsmouth on 16 March 1918. Between that day and 17 December 1918, she made five additional trips to Europe. Upon her arrival at New York City on 17 December 1918, Standard Arrow was scheduled for demobilization. She was decommissioned on 29 January 1919 and transferred to the United States Shipping Board. United States Navy service as USS Signal, 1944-1946 The U.S. Navy again acquired Standard Arrow on 4 April 1944 for World War II service and commissioned her as the miscellaneous auxiliary USS Signal (IX-142) the same day. Signal operated in the Pacific Ocean for the remainder of World War II, carrying and storing oil for Service Squadron 10, based at Majuro Atoll and Ulithi Atoll, and serving as station tanker at those atolls. In February 1946, the Navy transferred Signal to the Maritime Commission, which placed her in its reserve fleet at Mobile, Alabama. She was returned to her owner on 20 February 1946 and her name was stricken from the Navy List on 12 March 1946. Later career Once again named SS Standard Arrow, the ship resumed commercial operations for about a year. She was scrapped in April 1947.

Of unknown origins, there are multiple variations. The most well known variations are \\"The Old Woman From Boston\\" and \\"The Rich Old Lady\\". Other versions include \\"The Aul' Man and the Churnstaff\\", and \\"Woman from Yorkshire.\\" In Scotland it is known as \\"The Wily Auld Carle\\" or \\"The Wife of Kelso.\\" In Ireland there are variations called \\"The Old Woman of Wexford\\" and \\"Tigaree Torum Orum.\\" In England the song is widely known as \\"Marrowbones\\". \\"A similar song, \\"Johnny Sands\\" (Roud 184), was written by John Sinclair about 1840 and also became popular with local singers.\\" In this version the husband pretends to be tired of life, and asks his wife to tie his hands behind his back. Herbert Hughes writes that the song is English in origin. Synopsis The song concerns an old woman who, in one popular version, loves \\"her husband dearly, but another man twice as well.\\" She resolves to kill him, and is advised by a local doctor that feeding him eggs and marrowbone will make him blind. Thus > She fed him eggs and marrowbone > And made him sup them all > And it wasn't too long before > He couldn't see her at all She then arranges to push him into the river. He steps aside and she falls in.

Drivetrain and radiator of a 2/10 PS The 2/10 PS (two taxable / ten brake horsepower) had a single-cylinder half litre engine behind the passengers. The rear axle was chain-driven, with no differential. With a fuel consumption of it was the world's most fuel efficient mass-production car between the two World Wars due to the low- friction one-cylinder engine and its very light weight. The fenders, or wings, of the 2/10 PS were integrated into the bodywork of the car, allowing the passenger space to be wider than it would have been with the traditional separate fenders and running board. The compact drivetrain allowed the floor to be lower, making it possible to enter the car from the ground without a running board. The rounded appearance of the 2/10 PS, due to the envelope styling, earned it the nickname Kommissbrot after the inexpensive, flat-sided bread used by the military. The 2/10 PS faced competition from the Opel Laubfrosch and the Dixi DA1 variant of the Austin 7 and was replaced in 1928 by the more conventional 3/16 PS model.

The first prototype of a motorcycle called the Balkan M1 was presented at the 17th International Fair in Plovdiv in 1956 and was largely based on DKW RT 250. Production began in 1957. However, obvious technical and structural similarities with the German motorcycle soon led to protests by DKW, and Bulgarian engineers were forced to change the appearance of the M1. Production of the M2 (S) began in 1959. Numerous changes were made during the modernization of the motorcycle, most notably a chrome side cover of the tank was added, in which there was a new emblem of the Balkan company. Improvements continued with the new MD 250 engine, which had a volume of 247.3 cm³, increased power from 12 hp to 12.5 PS at 4800 rpm, consumption of 3.3 - 3.5 liters per 100 km and four gears. Three engineers were sent for training to the Jawa-ČZ, so it was visually similar to Jawa 250 type 559 \\"Panelka\\". Another Bulgarian motorcycle in the series was the Balkan 250 S2 (sport), which had the same engine as its predecessor. The differences were in the speedometer, the upper limit of which was increased from 140 km/h to 160 km/h, the whole two-seater saddle instead of two smaller ones in a row. The maximum speed of all models was around 110 km/h. The last pieces in made 1971 were equipped with turn signals. In the winter of 1959, the first 10 pieces of Balkan 250 K were produced Balkan 250, which were specially designed for racing. Compared to the standard models, they differed in the raised front fender and exhaust, smaller front headlight cover, speedometer located on the left side of the tank, aluminum cylinder with enlarged fins and side stand, instead of central stand. They produced a power of up to 18 PS. Prototypes of Balkan 350 (350 cm³) and Balkan M 175 (175 cm³, similar to the M 75) motorcycles were also produced for motocross purposes, however, very little is known about these models. Motorcycles with 250 cm³ engine displacement were produced until 1971.VMZ factory logo  Small motorcycles and mopeds  Since 1961 there were also single-cylinder two-stroke mopeds and mokicks produced in Lovech: * Balkan 50 MP Two series of this moped were produced: MP1 (1961-1962) and MP2 (1962-1967), also known as \\"Lyulin\\". The first series did not have a telescopic front fork and had only two gears, unlike the second one, which had three gears. Both mopeds had a frame made of pressed sheet steel, their engine with the designation MD 50 had a displacement of 48 cm³ and a power of 2.35 PS, a rotary knob on the handlebars instead of a shifting foot leverand starting with the pedals. * Balkan MK 50 (MPS) Manufactured in the years 1964 - 1967. Compared to the MP 50, it brought a number of design changes: an improved tubular frame, a new MD 50M engine with a capacity of 49 cm³ without pedals, 3 speeds, shifting with the foot lever on the left side and the exhaust located on the left. In addition, the appearance of the motorcycle changed. * Balkan MK 50-2 (MPM) A mokick with changed shapes of the tank and the headlight cover. It had the same engine as its predecessor with a power of 2.2 PS. Manufactured in 1967-1971. * Balkan MK 50-2Y25 The transitional \\"intermediate type\\" from the MPM differed by the chrome side cover of the tank and the new MD 50S engine, which was later used on the MK 50-3. * Balkan MK 50-3 New MD 50S engine with a total volume of 49 cm³ offered an increased output of 3.3 PS at 4800 rpm. A tool box was added under the seat and rear oil suspension instead of springs, the exhaust was located on the right. It was considered the most successful and competitive model in this category from the VMZ plant. The maximum speed of all models was around 60-65 kilometers per hour, a consumption of 1.5 - 1.8 liters per km. Since 1971 (due to legislative changes in Bulgaria) they have been equipped with turn signals. The production of mopeds up to 50 cm³ lasted until 1975. * Balkan M 75 The small Balkan M 75 motorcycle, manufactured from 1971 to 1975, had an engine capacity of 73 cm³ and achieved an output of 6 PS at 6600 rpm. It had a top speed 85 km/h.

Judaism teaches that to sin is a part of life, since there is no perfect man and everyone has an inclination to do evil \\"from his youth\\". Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins committed with willful intentions go without consequence. Sins committed out of lack of knowledge are not considered sins, since a sin can't be a sin if the one who did it didn't know it was wrong. Unintentional sins are considered less severe sins. Sins between people are considered much more severe in Judaism than sins between man and God. Yom Kippur, the main day of repentance in Judaism, can atone for sins between man and God, but not for sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend.Mishnah, Yoma,8:9 Eleazar ben Azariah derived [this from the verse]: \\"From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed\\" (Book of Leviticus, 16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow. When the Temple yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer Karbanot (sacrifices) for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of karbanot is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, karbanot only expiate unintentional sins, that is, sins committed because a person forgot that this thing was a sin or by error. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress or through lack of knowledge, and for the most part, karbanot cannot atone for a malicious, deliberate sin. In addition, karbanot have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents of his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation. The completely righteous (mean a man who did nothing wrong in his life) enjoy in this life and in the life after. The not completely righteous or completely wicked suffer for their sins in this world in order to atone for their sins through the humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them. If the repentance is not complete in this world, the suffering will continue in the life after (hell). After the repentance is complete they join the righteous. The completely wicked (a man who did nothing good in his life) cannot correct their sins in this world or in the other, and hence do not suffer for them here, but in gehinom (hell). The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave gehinom, because they don't or can't repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this, but God's justice is long, precise and just. Tanakh The first mention of sin as a noun is a zoomorphism, with sin (hattath) crouching at Cain's door. The first as a verb is Abimelech being prevented from sinning (khata) against God in a dream. In fact the whole Tanakh is full of references to sins committed by leading people. This is to teach us that no one is perfect, everyone standing in trials/tests, and the thing is to try your best to learn from their mistakes. People do have the ability to master this inclination () and choose good over evil (conscience) (). Judaism uses the term \\"sin\\" to include violations of Jewish law that are not necessarily a lapse in morality. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia: \\"Man is responsible for sin because he is endowed with free will (\\"behirah\\"); yet he is by nature frail, and the tendency of the mind is to evil: \\"For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth\\" (Gen. viii. 21; Yoma 20a; Sanh. 105a). Therefore God in His mercy allowed people to repent and be forgiven.\\" Judaism holds that all people sin at various points in their lives, and hold that God tempers justice with mercy. Terminology Hebrew has several other words for sin beyond hata, each with its own specific meaning. The word pesha, or \\"trespass\\", means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word aveira means \\"transgression\\". And the word avone, or \\"iniquity\\", means a sin done out of moral failing. The word most commonly translated simply as \\"sin\\", hata, literally means \\"to go astray.\\" Just as Jewish law, halakha, provides the proper \\"way\\" (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path. Judaism teaches that humans are born with free will, and morally neutral, with both a yetzer hatov, (literally, \\"the good inclination\\", in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a yetzer hara, (literally \\"the evil inclination\\", in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). The yetzer hara in some forms of Judaism means that Satan is merely an idiom or parable, rather than the fallen angel of traditional Christianity. In rabbinical literature Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno suggests that the verse about a leader begins with the term \\"when,\\" which implies that committing a sin is inevitable because powerful and wealthy people—the leaders—are also likely to sin. This Torah verse concludes with the words \\"realizes his guilt\\" (Leviticus 4:22) because it is essential that powerful people acknowledge and feel remorse for their sin, lest they sin again. Transgression The generic Hebrew word for any kind of sin is avera (literally: transgression). Based on verses in the Hebrew Bible, Judaism describes three levels of sin. There are three categories of a person who commits an avera. The first one is someone who does an avera intentionally, or \\"B'mezid.\\" This is the most serious category. The second is one who did an avera by accident. This is called \\"B'shogeg,\\" and while the person is still responsible for their action it is considered less serious. The third category is someone who is a \\"tinok shenishba\\", a person who was raised in an environment that was assimilated or non-Jewish, and is not aware of the proper Jewish laws, or halacha. This person is not held accountable for their actions. *Pesha (deliberate sin; in modern Hebrew: crime) or Mered (lit.: rebellion) - An intentional sin; an action committed in deliberate defiance of God; (Strong's Concordance :H6588 (פשע pesha', peh'shah). According to Strong it comes from the root (:H6586); rebellion, transgression, trespass. *Avon (lit.: iniquity) - This is a sin of lust or uncontrollable emotion. It is a sin done knowingly, but not done to defy God; (Strong's Concordance :H5771 (avon, aw-vone). According to Strong it comes from the root (:H5753); meaning perversity, moral evil:--fault, iniquity, mischief. *Cheit - This is an unintentional sin, crime or fault. (Strong's Concordance :H2399 (חַטָּא chate). According to Strong it comes from the root khaw-taw (:H2398, H2403) meaning \\"to miss, to err from the mark (speaking of an archer), to sin, to stumble.\\" States Judaism holds that no human being is perfect, and all people have sinned many times. The Talmud says: \\"Everyone is responsible to be as great as Moses\\", But then the Torah tells us in Deuteronomy 34:10 that \\"No one will ever be as great as Moses\\". This is to clarify that Moses fulfilled his own personal potential, so too we are expected to fulfill ours. Each person is born with a unique set of talents and tools. Some are rich, others are poor. Some are tall and some are short. One person can sing, another can write, etc. But these qualities are not what determine your greatness. Rather, it's how you deal with your particular circumstances. That's why Judaism says: It's not important where you are on the ladder, but how many rungs you've climbed. The crucial concept is the effort. Joseph Hertz said that sin is not an evil power whose chains the children of flesh must helplessly drag towards a weary tomb. We can always shake off its yoke; and what is more, we need never assume its yoke. An ancient fable tells us of distant oceans with mountainous magnetic rocks of such terrific power that wreck and ruin would befall any ship venturing near them. Instantly the iron nails would fly out of the ship, bolts and fastenings would be torn away by that magnetic force, the vessel would become nothing more than so many planks of wood, and all on board fall a prey to the hungry waters. Sins there are that, likewise, unhinge all our stays of character, rob us of the restraints of past habits and education, and leave us helpless playthings on the billows of temptation and passion. Yet a man is the pilot of his life’s barque, and can at all times steer it so as never to come near those mountains of destruction, darkness, and death. Based on the views of Rabbeinu Tam in the Babylonian Talmud (tractate Rosh HaShanah 17b), God is said to have Thirteen Attributes of Mercy: # God is merciful before someone sins, even though God knows that a person is capable of sin. # God is merciful to a sinner even after the person has sinned. # God represents the power to be merciful even in areas that a human would not expect or deserve. # God is compassionate, and eases the punishment of the guilty. # God is gracious even to those who are not deserving. # God is slow to anger. # God is abundant in kindness. # God is the God of truth, thus we can count on God's promises to forgive repentant sinners. # God guarantees kindness to future generations, as the deeds of the righteous patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) have benefits to all their descendants. # God forgives intentional sins if the sinner repents. # God forgives a deliberate angering of Him if the sinner repents. # God forgives sins that are committed in error. # God wipes away the sins from those who repent. As Jews are commanded in imitatio Dei, emulating God, rabbis take these attributes into account in deciding Jewish law and its contemporary application. Role of orthopraxy Jews recognize two kinds of sin, offenses against other people, and offenses against God. Offenses against God may be understood as violation of a contract (the covenant between God and the Children of Israel). Ezra, a priest and scribe, headed a large body of exiles. On his return to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God he discovered that Jews have been marrying non-Jews. He tore his garments in despair and confessed the sins of Israel before God, before going on to purify the community.Ezra 7–10 The Book of Jeremiah (Yirmiyahu [ירמיהו]) can be organized into five sub-sections. One part, Jeremiah 2-24, displays scorn for the sins of Israel. The poem in 2:1–3:5 shows the evidence of a broken covenant against Israel. Since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, Jews have believed that right action (as opposed to right belief) is the way for a person to atone for one's sins. Midrash Avot de Rabbi Natan states the following: :One time, when Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai was walking in Jerusalem with Rabbi Yehosua, they arrived at where the Temple now stood in ruins. \\"Woe to us\\" cried Rabbi Yehosua, \\"for this house where atonement was made for Israel's sins now lies in ruins!\\" Answered Rabban Yochanan, \\"We have another, equally important source of atonement, the practice of gemilut hasadim (\\"loving kindness\\"), as it is stated \\"I desire loving kindness and not sacrifice\\" (Hosea 6:6). In Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take. It does not teach that choosing good is impossible - only at times more difficult. There is almost always a \\"way back\\" if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person) Sins between man and his fellow Sins between people are considered much more severe in Judaism than sins between man and God. Yom Kippur, the main day of repent in Judaism can atones for sins between man and God, but not for sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend.(Mishnah, Yoma,8:9). Eleazar ben Azariah derived [this from the verse]: \\"From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed\\" (Book of Leviticus,16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow. The Gemara (87a) continues: \\"R. Yitzchak said: Whoever aggravates his fellow even through words is required to placate him… R. Yosi bar Chanina said: Whoever beseeches forgiveness from his friend should not beseech him more than three times. And if he died, [the offender] brings ten people and must stand them by his grave and he says, \\"I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and so-and-so whom I wounded.\\"\\" Many small sins vs. One big sin Two Jews came to a Chassidic Rabbi to ask advice about sins they had committed. One had committed a great sin for which he was sure God would never forgive him; the other was less worried, because he had never been guilty of anything so grave, but only of the normal collection of lesser sins. The Rabbi told them to go out to a field and select stones corresponding to the size and number of their sins, and later to return to the field and scatter the stones. This done, they came back to the Rabbi. \\"Now go to the field once more,\\" he told them both, \\"pick up the stones you scattered, and bring them to me.\\" He who had committed the one big sin knew at once which was his stone, and brought it to the Rabbi. The other, however, had scattered so many little stones that he could not be certain of identifying them again. He had a most difficult time in finding his stones and bringing them to the Rabbi. The Rabbi then told them: \\"Your deeds are like your stones. You who brought one large stone, committed a grave sin. But you were conscious of what you had done, and with a determined effort at repentance you could be forgiven by God. But you, whose sins were many and small, like those of most human beings, have found how hard it is to catch up with one's minor lapses. And no repentance of yours can possibly be effective until you realise that small things matter.\\" Selflessness vs. selfishness The rabbis recognize a positive value to the yetzer hara: one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was \\"very good\\" (God's work on the preceding days was just described as \\"good\\") and explain that without the yetzer ha'ra there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that yetzer ha'tov and yetzer ha'ra are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will. Or as Hillel the Elder famously summarized the Jewish philosophy: :\\"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? :And if I am only for myself, what am I? :And if not now, [then] when?\\" Another explanation is, without the existence of the yetzer ha'ra, there would be no merit earned in following God's commandments; choice is only meaningful if there has indeed been a choice made. So whereas creation was \\"good\\" before, it became \\"very good\\" when the evil inclination was added, for then it became possible to truly say that man could make a true choice to obey God's \\"mitzvot\\" (commandments). This is because Judaism views the following of God's ways as a desirable end in and of itself rather than a means to an end. Value of repentance The Babylonian Talmud teaches that \\"Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Eleazar both explain that as long as the Temple stood, the altar atoned for Israel, but now, one's table atones [when the poor are invited as guests].\\" (Tractate Berachot, 55a.) Repentance in itself is also a means of atonement (See Ezekiel 33:11, 33:19, Jeremiah 36:3, etc.) The Hebrew word for repentance is teshuvah which literally means to \\"return (to God).\\" The prophet Hosea (14:3) said, \\"Take with you words, and return to God.\\" Judaism teaches that our personal relationship with God allows us to turn directly to Him at any time, as Malachi 3:7 says, \\"Return to Me and I shall return to you,\\" and Ezekiel 18:27, \\"When the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.\\" Additionally, God is extremely compassionate and forgiving as is indicated in Daniel 9:18, \\"We do not present our supplications before You because of our righteousness, but because of Your abundant mercy.\\" The traditional liturgy of the Days of Awe (the High Holy Days; i.e. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) states that prayer, repentance and tzedakah (charitable actions) are ways to repent for sin. In Judaism, sins committed against people (rather than against God or in the heart) must first be corrected and put right to the best of a person's ability; a sin which has not also been put right as best as possible cannot truly be said to be repented. =True repentance= To a man who says “I will sin and repent, I will sin and repent,” the Day of Atonement brings no forgiveness. For sins against God the Day of Atonement brings forgiveness; for sins against one’s fellowman, the Day of Atonement brings no forgiveness till he has become reconciled with the fellowman he wronged (Mishnah Yoma 8:9). According to Maimonides in order to achieve true repentance the sinner must abandon his sin and remove it from his thoughts and resolve in his heart never to repeat it, as it is said, “Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts” (Isaiah 55:7). Likewise must he regret the past, as it is said: “Surely after I turned I repented” (Jer. 31:18). He must also call Him who knows all secrets to witness that he will never return to this sin again. =Atonement in the Temple period= Atonement for sin is discussed in the Tanakh. Rituals for atonement occurred in the Temple in Jerusalem, and were performed by the Kohanim, the Israelite priests. These services included song, prayer, offerings and animal sacrifices known as the korbanot. The rites for Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, are prescribed in the book of Leviticus chapter 16. The ritual of the scapegoat, sent into the wilderness to be claimed by Azazel, was one of these observances (Lev. 16:20-22). =Liturgical norms= The liturgy of the Days of Awe (the High Holy Days; i.e. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) states that prayer, repentance and tzedakah (the dutiful giving of charity) atone for sin. But prayer cannot atone for wrongs done, without an honest sincere attempt to rectify any wrong done to the best of one's ability, and the sincere intention to avoid repetition. Atonement to Jews means to repent and set aside, and the word \\"T'shuvah\\" used for atonement actually means \\"to return\\". Judaism is optimistic in that it always sees a way that a determined person may return to what is good, and that God waits for that day too. A number of animal sacrifices were prescribed in the Torah (five books of Moses) to make atonement: a sin-offering for sins, and a guilt offering for religious trespasses. The significance of animal sacrifice is not expanded on at length in the Torah, though Genesis 9:4 and Leviticus 17 suggest that blood and vitality were linked. Conservative Jews and Christians argue at the present era that the Jews never believed that the aim of all sacrifice is to pay the debt for sins - only the sin offering and the guilt offering had this purpose; modern scholars of early Jewish history, however, often disagree and argue that this division came later. Later Biblical prophets made statements to the effect that the hearts of the people were more important than their sacrifices: * \\"Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams\\" () * \\"For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt-offerings\\" () * \\"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart\\" () * \\"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? saith the LORD; I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats\\" () * \\"burnt- offering and sin-offering hast Thou not required\\" () Although the animal sacrifices were prescribed for atonement, there is no place where the Hebrew Bible says that animal sacrifice is the only means of atonement. The Hebrew Bible teaches that it is possible to return to God through repentance and prayer alone. For example, in the books of Jonah and Esther, both Jews and gentiles repented, prayed to God, and were forgiven for their sins, without having offered any sacrifices. Additionally, in modern times, most Jews do not even consider animal sacrifices. On the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, and the ten-day period between these holidays, repentance of sins committed is based on specialized prayers and hymns, while some Jews continue the ancient methods of sacrifice. An example of a common method of \\"sacrificing\\" for the sake of repentance is simply to drop bread into a body of water (as in the ceremony of Tashlikh), to signify the passing of sins and the hope for one to be written into the Book of Life by God once again. This is especially emphasized on what is arguably the holiest Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur.

They have written songs for Sandi Patti, Larnelle Harris and other Christian artists.  Biography  Melodie was raised in a minister of music's home in Fort Worth, and Dick came from a working family in Ohio. Both were musicians at an early age. In the late 1970s, they joined a Christian group called \\"Truth,\\" which brought the two together. After 18 months of constant touring, Dick joined the award- winning group the Imperials. Six months later the couple married and settled in Nashville, Tennessee. Throughout the 1980s, Dick and Melodie focused on songwriting and studio work, and immersed themselves in Nashville's creative community. Mel then formed the studio vocal group First Call with fellow studio singers Bonnie Keen and Marty McCall. In 1986, Christian artist Sandi Patty hired Dick as musical director and pianist, and First Call as her backup group. The \\"Let There Be Praise Tour\\" covered 150 cities in 18 months and launched First Call on a tour of their own while Dick remained on tour with Sandi. After the births of two daughters over a 15-month period, Dick and Melodie chose to return home from touring. Within a year, their first joint recording project, Let the Dreamers Dream, was released by Warner Alliance in 1991. Soon the couple found themselves traveling nearly every weekend to local churches across America, sharing a collection of Tunney songs aimed at Christians. All told, Dick and Mel spent a dozen years traveling to more than 400 churches nationwide. As their daughters grew into their high school years, the Tunneys devoted themselves to their local church's worship ministry the expansion of Dick's studio role as producer–arranger, so they could be closer to home. Mel continued to work as a session singer in Nashville, and Dick found himself recording and conducting ensembles like the London Philharmonic Orchestra, The Irish Film Orchestra and the City of Prague Philharmonic. In 2006, the First Baptist Church of Columbia, Tennessee invited Dick and Mel to lead the worship ministry of its growing congregation, first on an interim basis and then as worship leaders/artists in residence. Soon thereafter, Steve Green Ministries invited Dick to tour with him as pianist and musical director.  Awards  The Tunneys' have received ten Dove Awards, nearly 30 Dove nominations and a Grammy Award (for “How Excellent Is Thy Name”, recorded by Larnelle Harris). Their songs have appeared in print music and church hymnals, and Dick and Mel have shared the stage with many Christian artists. They have also been in involved in many recording projects as studio vocalist, keyboard player, arranger(s) and producer. They have recorded eight albums together, and Dick has recorded five solo instrumental albums. The couple has penned more than 150 songs, many of which have been recorded by other Christian artists.

Early life Born in Exeter, Weston was the eldest son of Stephen Weston (died 19 January 1750), registrar of the diocese of Exeter, and his wife Elizabeth Oxenham of South Tawton, Devon; Stephen Weston (1665–1742) the bishop of Exeter was his grandfather. He was educated at Blundell's School, Eton College and Exeter College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 7 June 1764, and resided from 4 July 1764 to 7 July 1768. He graduated B.A. in 1768, M.A. in 1770, B.D. in 1782, and was a Devonshire fellow of his college from 1768 to 1784.http://www.blundells.org/admin/school_notable-obs.htm Clergy years Penelope Tierney, later Mrs. Stephen Weston (1758-1789)About 1771 Weston accompanied Sir Charles Warwick Bampfylde as tutor in a long tour on the continent of Europe. Wilmot Vaughan, 1st Earl of Lisburne, an early friend, nominated Weston on 29 March 1777 to the rectory of Mamhead, Devon. During his incumbency there he rebuilt the parsonage house. He was instituted on 17 January 1784 to the rectory of Little Hempston, near Totnes. There he moved into the north chancel window of the church some stained glass which had been in Marldon church. He vacated his fellowship in 1784, on marrying. Late in 1790 he resigned the living of Mamhead, but retained the benefice of Little Hempston until 1823. Art and literature focus After the death of his wife, Weston concentrated on art and literature. He witnessed the Paris events of the French Revolution in 1791 and 1792, leaving in mid-August 1792 when he felt unsafe. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 1 March 1792 and of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 18 December 1794, and lived for some years among the dilettanti in London. After the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 he visited Paris again, and then once more during the summer of 1829. Weston was dubbed by Thomas James Mathias and George Steevens \\"Classic Weston\\", and he was flattered to have a circle of female admirers. At the age of 82 he died in Edward Street, Portman Square, London, on 8 January 1830. Auction catalogues of the \\"remaining portion of his library\\" and of his \\"Greek and Roman coins and medals\\" were issued that year. He left an annuity for the poor of the parishes of Little Hempston, Mamhead, and Marylebone. Works Weston in 1802 made an English translation of the Greek text of the trilingual Rosetta Stone. The Society of Antiquaries published it in 1811. Weston also published travel notes, classical texts and annotations, notes on Shakespeare, scriptural discussions and translations from Arabic, Chinese and Persian.

According to the classical definition of St. Augustine of Hippo sin is \\"a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God.\\"Contra Faustum Manichaeum, 22,27; PL 42,418; cf. Thomas Aquinas, STh I–II q71 a6.Mc Guinness, p. 241 Christian hamartiology is closely related to concepts of natural law, moral theology and Christian ethics. Among some scholars, sin is understood mostly as legal infraction or contract violation of non-binding philosophical frameworks and perspectives of Christian ethics, and so salvation tends to be viewed in legal terms. Other Christian scholars understand sin to be fundamentally relational—a loss of love for the Christian God and an elevation of self-love (\\"concupiscence\\", in this sense), as was later propounded by Augustine in his debate with the Pelagians.On Grace and Free Will (see Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, trans. P.Holmes, vol. 5; 30–31 [14–15]). As with the legal definition of sin, this definition also affects the understanding of Christian grace and salvation, which are thus viewed in relational terms.Christian grace is understood as God's love brought to the human soul by the God the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5), and salvation is the establishment of that love relationship.For a historical review of this understanding, see R.N.Frost, \\"Sin and Grace\\", in Paul L.

(Punctum Books 2012 , p. 62 is the Christian doctrine of humanity's state of sin resulting from the fall of man, stemming from Adam's rebellion in Eden, namely the sin of disobedience in consuming from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a \\"sin nature\\", to something as drastic as total depravity or automatic guilt of all humans through collective guilt. The concept of original sin was first alluded to in the 2nd century by Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon in his controversy with certain dualist Gnostics. Other church fathers such as Augustine also developed the doctrine, seeing it as based on the New Testament teaching of Paul the Apostle ( and ) and the Old Testament verse of .Peter Nathan – The Original View of Original Sin – Retrieved 14 October 2013.Phil Porvaznik – Original Sin Explained and Defended Evangelical Catholic Apologetics – Retrieved 14 October 2013.Preamble and Articles of Faith – V.

Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose and Ambrosiaster considered that humanity shares in Adam's sin, transmitted by human generation. Augustine's formulation of original sin was popular among Protestant reformers, such as Martin Luther and John Calvin, who equated original sin with concupiscence, affirming that it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom. The Jansenist movement, which the Catholic Church declared to be heretical, also maintained that original sin destroyed freedom of will.\\"Jansenius and Jansenism\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia Substantial branches of hamartiological understanding, including Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Continental Reformed, and Reformed Baptist subscribe to the doctrine of original sin, which the Apostle Paul espouses in and which Augustine of Hippo popularized in the West and developed into a notion of \\"hereditary sin\\". The North African bishop taught that God holds all the descendants of Adam and Eve accountable for Adam's sin of rebellion, and as such all people deserve God's wrath and condemnation – apart from any actual sins they personally commit.Bavink, Herman. Reformed Dogmatics Vol. 3. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2004) Pages 75-125 detail the historical development of Hamartiology, including Pelagius's position and the mediating positions) In contrast, a view sometimes ascribed to Pelagius states that humans enter life as moral \\"blank slates\\" (tabulae rasae) responsible for their own moral nature. The Fall that occurred when Adam and Eve disobeyed God, according to Pelagianism, affected humankind only minimally as it established a negative moral precedent. Few contemporary theologians (especially thinkers in Augustinian traditions) and no orthodox theologians, however, continue to hold this hamartiological viewpoint. A third branch of thinking takes an intermediate position, asserting that since the Fall the sin of Adam has naturally affected human beings such that they have inborn tendencies to rebel against God (in which rebellion by personal choice all accountable humans, except Jesus and, to Catholics, Mary, will choose or have chosen to indulge). This is the hamartiological position of the Eastern Christian churches, often called ancestral sin as opposed to original sin, but it is sometimes viewed as Semipelagian in the West, especially by the Reformed. Divisions of sin Sin can be divided by reason of: *gravity: mortal and venial; *state of the conscience: formal and material; *act or state: actual and habitual; *person offended: sins against God, against neighbor, against self; *manner: commission, omission; *manifestation: internal, external; *author: original and non-original (personal, actual); *attention: deliberate, half-deliberate; *cause: ignorance, fragility, malice; *special disorder: sins against the Holy Ghost and sins that cry to Heaven for vengeance; *proper or improper; *psychological fertility: capital sins.https://paroquiasantabertila.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/09-moral- fundamental-pecado.ppt  Roman Catholic views  Thomas Aquinas = sins of omission, and sins of commission The way Thomas Aquinas viewed sin and vices was radically different from later approaches, especially that of 17th- century moral theology. He presented sin and vices as contraries of virtues. He discusses the subject in his Summa Theologica part Ia–IIae (Prima secundae) qq. 71–89.Pinckaers, pp. 220 and 225–6 In one of his definitions of sin Thomas quotes Augustine of Hippo's description of sin as \\"a thought, words and deed against the Eternal Law.\\"'Contra Faustum, 22, 27, PL 44,418: To recognise the possibilities of sin in man is equal to acknowledge his human nature, his control and mastery of his own actions. Sin is a motion to the goal, it is judged by the object to which it is directed. The field of sin is the same as the field of virtue. There are three major fields: relationship with God, with oneself and with the neighbour. Thomas distinguished between mortal and venial sins. Mortal sin is when a person has irreparably destroyed the very principle of his/her order to the goal of life. Venial sin is when he/she has acted in a certain disordered way without destructing that principle: According to Aquinas the gravity of sin depends also on some disposition of the agent (cf. STh I–II q. 18, aa. 4, 6). Sin, venial by reason of its object, may become mortal. It happens when person fixes his/her ultimate happiness, the last end of his/her life (Lat. finis ultimus) in the object of that venial sin. When venial sin is used as a way to provoke mortal sin it becomes mortal as well, e.g. when someone uses empty conversation or a chat to seduce someone to commit adultery. Also sin, mortal by reason of its object, may become venial because of the agent's disposition when his/her evil act does not have full moral capacity, i.e. is not deliberated by reason. That may happen for instance when sudden movements of unbelief arise in the mind. (Cf. STh I–II q.72 a.5). The difference and gravity of sins may be discerned on the grounds of spirit and flesh, even mortal sins may differ in gravity. Carnal sins like lust, adultery or fornication, gluttony and avarice, because the person who commits them is inordinately directed towards material goods that are a serious matter, are mortal sins. They may cause much shame and infamy. But spiritual sins like blaspheming of God or apostasy are, according to Thomas, still greater evil, as they have more of the aversion from God. They are directed against a greater object. The formal, essential element of sin is more at the centre in them. (cf. STh I–II q.72 a.2)Cf. Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica I–II q. 72 Of the Distinction of SinsFarrell, pp. 255–272 According to another formulation of the concept of sin in the Summa, at the heart of sin is \\"the turning away from the immutable good\\", i.e. God, and \\"inordinate turning to mutable good\\", i.e. creatures. (STh I–IIae q.87 a.4) This cannot be understood as if in the concrete sinful deed the sinner commits two separate and independent acts. Both aversio and conversio constitute one single guilty action. At the root of the inordinate turning to the creatures is self-love which expresses itself in disordered desire (cupiditas) and rebellion towards God (superbia).; cf. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica II–IIae q34 a2; I q94 a1; II–IIae q162 a6; I–IIae q72 a2. Speaking about sloth (Lat. acedia) Thomas points out that every deed which \\"by its very nature is contrary to charity is a mortal sin\\". An effect of such deed is the destruction of \\"spiritual life which is the effect of charity, whereby God dwells in us.\\" Sin of a mortal character is always committed with the consent of reason: \\"Because the consummation of sin is in the consent of reason\\"'. (cf. STh II–IIae q.35 a.3) Venial and mortal sins can be compared to sickness and death. While venial sin impairs full healthy activity of a person, mortal sin destroys the principle of spiritual life in him/her.Farrell, p. 353 = Catechism = Roman Catholic doctrine distinguishes between personal sin (also sometimes called \\"actual sin\\") and original sin. Personal sins are either mortal or venial. Mortal sins are sins of grave (serious) matter, where the sinner performs the act with full knowledge and deliberate consent. (cf. CCC 1857) The act of committing a mortal sin destroys charity, i. e. the grace in the heart of a Christian; it is in itself a rejection of God (CCC1855). If left un-reconciled, mortal sins may lead to eternal separation from God, traditionally called damnation. Venial sins are sins which do not meet the conditions for mortal sins. The act of committing a venial sin does not cut off the sinner from God's grace, as the sinner has not rejected God. However, venial sins do injure the relationship between the sinner and God, and as such, must be reconciled to God, either through the Sacrament of Reconciliation or receiving the Eucharist (after proper contrition fulfilled). Both mortal and venial sins have a dual nature of punishment. They incur both guilt for the sin, yielding eternal punishment, and temporal punishment for the sin. Reconciliation is an act of God's mercy, and addresses the guilt and eternal punishment for sin. Purgatory and indulgences address the temporal punishment for sin, and exercise of God's justice. Roman Catholic doctrine also sees sin as being twofold: Sin is, at once, any evil or immoral action which infracts God's law and the inevitable consequences, the state of being that comes about by committing the sinful action. Sin can and does alienate a person both from God and the community. Hence, the Catholic Church's insistence on reconciliation with both God and the Church itself. The Roman Catholic view of sin has recently expanded. Monsignor Gianfranco Girotti, Regent of the Catholic Apostolic Penitentiary, has said that \\"known sins increasingly manifest themselves as behavior that damages society as a whole,\\" including, for example: * \\"certain violations of the fundamental rights of human nature, through genetic manipulations [or experiments],\\" * \\"drug [abuse], which weakens the mind and obscures intelligence,\\" * \\"environmental pollution,\\" * \\"abortion and pedophilia,\\" and * the widening social and economic differences between the rich and the poor, which \\"cause an unbearable social injustice\\" (accumulating excessive wealth, inflicting poverty). The revision was aimed at encouraging confession or the Sacrament of Penance. Mortal sins, which are any severe and intentional actions that directly disobey God, are often confused with the seven deadly sins, which are pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. They are not, however, the same. The seven deadly sins are called \\"deadly\\" because they might lead another to commit other sins. Some forms of the seven deadly sins (i.e. debilitating one's health because of their love of food) can constitute as grave matter, while others may just be venal (i.e. over-eating). Another group of four or five sins distinguished by the Church are the sins that cry to heaven: murder, sodomy, oppression of the weak, and defrauding the laborer.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1997: \\"1867 The catechetical tradition also recalls that there are \\"sins that cry to heaven\\": the blood of Abel, the sin of the Sodomites, the cry of the people oppressed in Egypt, the cry of the foreigner, the widow, and the orphan, injustice to the wage earner.\\"  Reformed and Lutheran views  Many Protestants of a Calvinist orientation teach that, due to original sin, humanity has lost any and all capacity to move towards reconciliation with God (Romans 3:23;6:23; Ephesians 2:1–3); in fact, this inborn sin turns humans away from God and towards themselves and their own desires (Isaiah 53:6a). Thus, humans may be brought back into a relationship with God only by way of God's rescuing the sinner from his/her hopeless condition (Galatians 5:17–21; Ephesians 2:4–10) through Jesus' substitutionary atonement (Romans 5:6–8; Colossians 2:13–15; 1 Timothy 2:5–6). According to traditional Reformed theology and classical Lutheranism, Salvation is sola fide (by faith alone); sola gratia (by grace alone); and is begun and completed by God alone through Jesus (Ephesians 2:8,9). This understanding of original sin (Romans 5:12–19), is most closely associated with Calvinist doctrine (see total depravity) and Lutheranism. Calvinism allows for the relative or nominal \\"goodness\\" of humanity through God's common grace upon both those predestined to salvation and those predestined to damnation, upon the regenerate and the unregenerate. This is in contrast to the Roman Catholic teaching that while sin has tarnished the original goodness of humanity prior to the Fall, it has not entirely extinguished that goodness, or at least the potential for goodness, allowing humans to reach towards God to share in the Redemption which Jesus Christ won for them. Some Protestants and Orthodox Christians hold similar views. There is dispute about where sin originated. Some who interpret the king of Tyre in Ezekiel 28 as a symbol for Satan believe sin originated when Satan coveted the position that rightfully belongs to God. The origin of individual sins is discussed in James 1:14–15 – \\"14but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. 15Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.\\" (NIV) = Defined types of sin = Within some branches of Protestantism, there are several defined types of sin (as in Roman Catholicism): *Original sin—Most denominations of Christianity interpret the Garden of Eden account in Genesis in terms of the fall of man. Adam and Eve's disobedience was the first sin man ever committed, and their original sin (or the effects of the sin) is passed on to their descendants (or has become a part of their environment). See also: total depravity. *Concupiscence *Venial sin *Greed *Lust *Pride *Mortal sin *Eternal sin—Commonly called the Unforgivable sin (mentioned in ), this is perhaps the most controversial sin, whereby someone has become an apostate, forever denying themselves a life of faith and experience of salvation; the precise nature of this sin is often disputed.  Methodist views  The Wesleyan- Arminian theology of the Methodist Churches teaches that humans, though being born in total depravity, can turn to God as a result of prevenient grace and do good; this prevenient grace convicts humans of the necessity of the new birth (first work of grace), through which he is justified (pardoned) and regenerated. When the believer is entirely sanctified (second work of grace), his/her original sin is washed away. After this, to willfully sin would be to fall from grace. Methodist theology firstly distinguishes between original sin and actual sin: It further categorizes sin as being \\"sin proper\\" and \\"sin improper\\". Sins proper (or sin, properly so called) are those that are committed freely and willfully, which result in a loss of entire sanctification. Sins improper (or sin, improperly so called) are those in the \\"category of benign neglect, fruits of infirmity (forgetfulness, lack of knowledge, etc)\\". Sins improper, though they need to be confessed and repented of, do not result in the loss of salvation. John Wesley explains the matter like this: > \\"Nothing is sin, strictly speaking, but a voluntary transgression of a known > law of God. Therefore, every voluntary breach of the law of love is sin; and > nothing else, if we speak properly. To strain the matter farther is only to > make way for Calvinism. There may be ten thousand wandering thoughts, and > forgetful intervals, without any breach of love, though not without > transgressing the Adamic law. But Calvinists would fain confound these > together. Let love fill your heart, and it is enough!\\"Wesley, J. (1872). The > Works of John Wesley (Third Edition, Vol. 12, p. 394). London: Wesleyan > Methodist Book Room. If a person backslides through sin proper but later returns to God, he or she must repent and be entirely sanctified again, according to Wesleyan-Arminian theology.  Eastern Christian views  The (Chalcedonian) Eastern Orthodox as well as the (non-Chalcedonian) Oriental Orthodox use \\"sin\\" both to refer to humanity's fallen condition and to refer to individual sinful acts. In many ways the Orthodox Christian view of sin is similar to the Jewish, although neither form of Orthodoxy makes formal distinctions among \\"grades\\" of sins. The Eastern Catholic Churches, which derive their theology and spirituality from same sources as the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox, tend not to adhere to the Roman Catholic distinction between mortal and venial sin taught by the Latin Church. Like the Orthodox Churches, however, the Eastern Catholic Churches do make a distinction between sins that are serious enough to bar one from Holy Communion (and must be confessed before receiving once again) and those which are not sufficiently serious to do so. In this respect, the Eastern Tradition is similar to the Western, but the Eastern Churches do not consider death in such a state to automatically mean damnation to \\"hell.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses Jehovah's Witnesses believe that sin is inherited, like a disease, and has been passed on from generation to generation of humans, beginning with Adam and Eve, whom Witnesses believe are real historical characters.\\"What Does the Bible Really Teach\\" pp. 61–63 'Why humans die?' They believe that it began with the Devil, and then with humans wanting to decide for themselves what was \\"Good and Bad.\\" They believe that at that very moment they lost perfection and began to die. Jehovah's Witnesses consider human beings to be souls, and so when a human dies due to sin, they believe that his soul dies as well.\\"What Does the Bible Really Teach\\" pp. 57–65 'Where are the Dead?' They believe that Jesus is the only human ever to have lived and died sinless.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe that individuals are only responsible for the sins they personally commit. In their Articles of Faith the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches, \\"We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression.\\" Latter-day Saints also believe that sin is the consequence of the Fall of Adam and Eve, and that all sin originates from Satan. They also believe that \\"little children\\" (meaning those under the age of 8) are not capable of sinning, because they are not yet accountable for their actions. Atonement In Christianity, it is generally understood that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice that relieves believers of the burden of their sins. However, the actual meaning of this precept is very widely debated. The traditional teaching of some churches traces this idea of atonement to blood sacrifices in the ancient Hebraic faith. Christian theologians have presented different interpretations of atonement: * Origen taught that the death of Christ was a ransom paid to Satan in satisfaction of his claim on the souls of humanity as a result of sin. This was opposed by theologians such as St. Gregory Nazianzen, who maintained that this would have made Satan a power equal to God. * Irenaeus of Lyons taught that Christ recapitulated in himself all the stages of life of sinful man, and that his perfect obedience substituted for Adam's disobedience. * Athanasius of Alexandria taught that Christ came to overcome death and corruption, and to remake humanity in God's image again.See On the Incarnation, by St. Athanasius * Augustine of Hippo said that sin was not a created thing at all, but was \\"privatio boni\\", a \\"taking away of good\\". * Anselm of Canterbury taught that Christ's death satisfied God's offended sense of justice over the sins of humanity. God rewarded Christ's obedience, which built up a storehouse of merit and a treasury of grace that believers could share by their faith in Christ. This view is known as the satisfaction theory of atonement, the merit theory, or sometimes the commercial theory. Anselm's teaching is contained in his treatise Cur Deus Homo (Why God Became Human). Anselm's ideas were later expanded utilizing Aristotelian philosophy into a grand theological system by Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, particularly in his Summa Theologica, which although initially inciting controversy eventually became official Roman Catholic doctrine. * Pierre Abélard developed the view that Christ's Passion was God suffering with his creatures in order to show the greatness of his love for them, and the realization of this love in turn leads to repentance. It is often known as the moral influence theory of atonement and became central to more liberal strands of Christian theology. * Martin Luther and John Calvin, leaders of the Protestant Reformation, owed much to Anselm's theory and taught that Christ, the only sinless person, was obedient to take upon himself the penalty for the sins that should have been visited on men and women. This view is a version of substitutionary atonement and is sometimes called the penal substitution view. It is derived from the Roman Catholic satisfaction theory of atonement, although it is not identical to that of Anselm. Calvin additionally advocated a doctrine of limited atonement, which teaches that the atonement extends and applies only to the sins of the eternally predestined elect rather than to the entire human race, whereas Anselm affirmed a general redemption for all humanity and denied that Christ received punishment for sins, although he made satisfaction to God. * D.L. Moody once said, \\"If you are under the power of evil, and you want to get under the power of God, cry to Him to bring you over to His service; cry to Him to take you into His army. He will hear you; He will come to you, and, if need be, He will send a legion of angels to help you to fight your way up to heaven. God will take you by the right hand and lead you through this wilderness, over death, and take you right into His kingdom. That's what the Son of Man came to do. He has never deceived us; just say here; \\"Christ is my deliverer.\\"\\" * Arminianism has traditionally taught what is known as the governmental theory of atonement. Drawing primarily from the works of Jacobus Arminius and especially Hugo Grotius, the governmental theory teaches that Christ suffered for humankind so that God could forgive humans while still maintaining divine justice. Unlike the traditional Reformed perspective, this view states that Christ was not punished by God the Father in the place of sinners, for true forgiveness would not be possible if humankind's offences were already punished. Christ's suffering was a real and meaningful substitutionary atonement for the punishment humans deserve, but Christ was not punished on behalf of some or all of the human race. This view has prospered in traditional Methodism and all who follow the teachings of John Wesley, and has been detailed by, among others, 19th century Methodist theologian John Miley in his Atonement in Christ and 20th century Church of the Nazarene theologian J. Kenneth Grider in his Wesleyan-Holiness Theology. Variations of this view have also been espoused by 18th century Puritan Jonathan Edwards and 19th century revival leader Charles Grandison Finney. * Karl Barth taught that Christ's death manifested God's love and his hatred for sin. * Barbara Reid, a dissenting Roman Catholic feminist and Dominican nun, argues that commonly conceived atonement theologies are harmful, especially to women and other oppressed minorities.Barbara E. Reid, Taking Up the Cross: New Testament Interpretations Through Latina and Feminist Eyes (Fortress, 2007), 17–19. Other liberal and radical theologians have also challenged traditional views of atonement. (see collective salvation) * Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian Science movement, taught that atonement exemplifies our underlying spiritual unity with God, whereby we reflect divine Love (God): Christ's atonement reconciles man to God, not God to man .

The song is considered to be an early (perhaps the earliest) example of a mashup, featuring segments of popular songs intertwined with spoken \\"news\\" commentary to tell the story of a visit from a flying saucer. Bill Buchanan plays the radio announcer, stating that the spacemen are attacking Earth. Dickie Goodman plays reporter John Cameron-Cameron (a play on the broadcaster John Cameron Swayze). Goodman would re-visit this character in several other 'Flying Saucer' records. Structure The song uses clips from 17 different songs, each of which was a top 20 hit in 1955 or 1956.

Some original copies have a handwritten \\"L\\" at the beginning of the original label name \\"Universe\\" (pronounced Looney-verse) as the result of a Universe label already in existence at the time. Most copies show the entire word \\"Luniverse\\" typeset. An edited version of \\"The Flying Saucer\\" for the Dickie Goodman compilations Greatest Hits (1983) and Greatest Fables (1997) feature fake re-recorded clips of \\"Tutti Frutti\\" and \\"Band Of Gold\\". The segments for \\"Long Tall Sally\\" and \\"(You've Got) The Magic Touch\\" were completely removed. The record also contains an early, deliberate backward secret message in part two. The alien message in their own language plays as \\"caution, secretary of defense\\" when played backward. The entire record was immediately covered by Sid Noel and his Outer Spacemen (Aladdin 3331—7/56), and again in a shorter form, by Alan Freed, Al \\"Jazzbo\\" Collins and Steve Allen (\\"The Space Man\\"—Coral 9-61693—1956), and again in 1960 by Geddins & Sons (\\"Space Man\\"—Jumpin' 50001—1960), and again in the late 1950s, but with many variants from the original, by Dewey, George & Jack And The Belltones (\\"Flying Saucers Have Landed\\"—Raven 700). There was even an answer record made about it, another break-in called, \\"The Answer To The Flying Saucer U. F. O. (Men From Mars)\\" by Syd Lawrence and Friends—Cosmic, which teased Buchanan & Goodman by daring them, on the record, to sue the artist for copying their style. That dare poked fun at the fact that the record was controversial from the moment it hit the shelves. Its wide use of \\"sampling\\" prompted music publishers to file suit against Buchanan and Goodman in July (1956). The two men were verbally attacked by record companies, too, with an anonymous source telling Billboard, \\"If we can't stop this nothing is safe in our business.\\"\\"Flying Saucer Takes Off; Pubbers, Diskers Do a Flip\\" Billboard, July 28, 1956, p. 17 While \\"The Flying Saucer\\" was not the first record to quote from famous songs (see \\"Cool Whalin'\\" by Babs Gonzales), it was the first popular record to sample directly from the records themselves. The comedians made fun of their own predicament by issuing a follow-up song, \\"Buchanan and Goodman on Trial\\" (Luniverse 102). By November, 1956, the novelty song had stood up in court, being labeled as artful and clever. A judge refused to issue an injunction prohibiting the sales of the record.\\"Modern Joins in Luniverse Suit\\" Billboard, November 17, 1956, pp. 16,30 Essentially, the record was considered a new work. This made it legal for artists to sample existing records—a practice that became very popular in subsequent years. Other sampling records from 1956 included \\"Marty on Planet Mars\\" (Novelty 101) and \\"Dear Elvis\\" (Plus 104). The 1964 record, \\"The Beatle Flying Saucer\\" – credited to \\"Ed Solomon\\" (Diamond D-160) – was structured in the same fashion as the Buchanan & Goodman original. The comedian Albert Brooks parodied flying saucer records on his album A Star is Bought (1975). The producer of the record is first warned by industry insiders that he won't be able to afford the rights fees for the song clips, so he decides to fabricate rock and roll songs and use clips from his creations.

Muslims see sin as anything that goes against the commands of God (Allah), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion. Islam teaches that sin is an act and not a state of being. It is believed that God weighs an individual's good deeds and against their sins on the Day of Judgement and punishes those individuals whose evil deeds outweigh their good deeds. These individuals are thought to be sentenced to afterlife in the fires of jahannam (Hell). The Quran describes these sins throughout the text and demonstrates that some sins are more punishable than others in the hereafter. A clear distinction is made between major and minor sins (53:31–32), indicating that if an individual stays away from the major sins, then they will be forgiven of the minor sins. Sources differ on the exact meanings of the different terms for sin used in the Islamic tradition.  Terminology  A number of different words for sin are used in the Islamic tradition. According to A.J. Wensinck's entry in the Encyclopedia of Islam, Islamic terms for sin include dhanb and khaṭīʾa, which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; khiṭʾ, which means simply a sin; and ithm, which is used for grave sins. According to Cyril Glasse, Islam recognizes two kinds of sin (khati'ah): dhanb, a fault or shortcoming which is to be sanctioned; and ithm, a willful transgression which is to be punished. In scripturesSemantic analysis of terminology in the Quran= Several different words are used in the Quran to describe sin—1) Dhanb 2) Ithm 3) Khati’ah 4) Jurm 5) Junah/Haraj. By examining the choice of words in Quranic verses used in connection with these terms, scholars have attempted to determine which sins are associated with which terms.  Dhanb Dhanb (plural dhunub) is frequently applied to heinous sins committed against God. One of the main examples of Dhanb in the Quran is of “crying lies of God’s signs”, or having excessive pride that prevents an individual from believing the signs of God. This use of dhanb in the Quran exemplifies that this type of sin is punishable in the afterlife. In fact, dhanb is considered a ‘great’ sin and is often used in the Quran to contrast with sayyi’a, which denotes a ‘smaller’ sin. The Quran states that if you avoid these great sins, your lesser evil deeds or sayyi’at will be forgiven.  Ithm Some scholars believe the basic meaning of ithm to be an unlawful deed that is committed intentionally. This contrasts to dhanb in that dhanb can be both intentional and unintentional. However, this definition is somewhat nebulous and the best description of the word is based on the contextual situations. In the Quran, ithm is found quite frequently in legislative descriptions. For example, falsely accusing your own wife in order to gain money is constituted as an ithm (Quran 4: 24/20). However, ithm is also used in connection with haram, or committing an unlawful deed, a taboo, such as consuming food or drink that is forbidden by God: Ithm is also associated with what is considered the worst sin of all, shirk. Shirk signifies the accepting of a presence of other divinities at the side of God. The Quran states that: This association with shirk is noteworthy for shirk is considered unforgivable if not repented of.  Khati’ah Khati’ah is considered by many scholars to be a “moral lapse” or a “mistake” This interpretation has led some scholars to believe that Khati’ah is a lesser sin than ithm; however, the word Khati’ah is frequently used in conjunction with ithm in the Quran. This Quranic verse indicates that khati’ah is considered an ithm, a grave sin. In fact, the word khati’ah is associated with some of the most heinous religious sins in the Quran. In one Quranic verse this word is used to describe the sin of slaying one's own children for fear of poverty. (Quran 17:33/31). Scholars believe that dhanb or ithm could be used in place of khati’ah in this instance; however, the word choice indicates that khati’ah is more than just a moral lapse or mistake and is punishable.  Jurm The word Jurum is often considered to be a synonym of dhanb for it is used to describe some of the same sins: crying lies of God and not believing the signs of God. In the Quran, the word mostly appears in the form of mujrim, one who commits a jurm. These individuals are described in the Quran as having arrogance towards the believers.  Junah/Haraj Junah and Haraj have a similar meaning to that of ithm, a sin that warrants a punishment. In fact, these words are used almost interchangeably with ithm in the same chapters in the Quran. Like ithm, these words are found frequently in legislative portions of the Quran, particularly relating to regulations regarding marriage and divorce. =Definition in Hadith= Sin is discussed extensively in the hadith, (the collection of Muhammad's sayings). It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an: Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported: In Sunan al-Tirmidhi, a Hadith is narrated: In Sahih Muslim, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari and Abu Huraira narrated: Repentance of sin According to Islam, one can be forgiven of sins through genuine tawbah (repentance) which literally means \\"to return.\\" Unlike the Catholic concept of atonement, tawbah does not entail formal, ecclesiastical confession to a religious leader. Like Protestantism, Islam allows followers to repent directly to God. In addition, while Christianity and Islam considers humans as prone to sin, Islam ultimately views them as responsible for their actions and refutes the Christian concept of original sin. More so, in Islam Muslims are discouraged from confessing their sins and sharing the wrongdoings of others. Also, according to Islam, Blood sacrifice cannot add to Divine Grace nor replace the necessity of repentance. However, sacrifice is done to help the poor and to remember Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son at God's command. When a human has violated another human’s rights, ḥuqūq al- ʿibād, compensation is necessary in order to show that one has made amends. When a human has offended or disobeyed God, ḥuqūq Allāh, penitence, remorse, and resolution are necessary in order to show that one is sincere, and will not repeat the wrongdoing in the future. According to Shaddad ibn Aws: From a traditionalist perspective, sin is applied to an individual’s actions. Through belief and good works, an individual can remove his/her sin and attain God’s good favor. Classical legal scholar Muhammad al-Shafi'i (767 – 820) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as: From a modernist perspective, sin has also been applied to a group or community’s collective behavior. Through public acknowledgement of wrongdoing, people can take responsibility for the lack of morality within their society and enact social reform. Egyptian reformer Muḥammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905) and his disciple Muḥammad Rashīd Ridā (1865–1935) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as: Other modern reformers, such as Sayyid Qutb, held that repentance involved a renewed, holistic commitment to Islam, rather than admission of sin for the sake of being pardoned of punishment. This understanding draws from classical Sufi thought, whereby one experiences a personality transformation and his/her sinful impulses are replaced by virtue. Qutb derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as: According to Shaddad ibn Aws: However, regardless of one's outward deeds, God does not accept the forgiveness of those who are insincere in their repentance and only do so in order to avoid jahannam. Major sins: Al-Kabirah The most heinous sins in Islam are known as Al-Kabirah () which translates to the great or major one. Some authors use the term enormity. While every sin is seen as an offense to Allah, the al-Kaba'ir are the gravest of the offenses. Allah's power is thought to be only eclipsed by his mercy and thus small sins are tacitly understood to be forgiven after repentance. Not every sin is equal however and some are thought to be more spiritually damning than others. The greatest of the sins described as al-Kaba'ir is the association of others with Allah or Shirk. Scholars differ as to how many major sins there are. In contrasting major sins with minor sins (al-sagha'ir), the eighth-century Shafi'i scholar Al-Dhahabi found the hadith collections of Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj listed seven major sins, while the tradition from Abd Allah ibn Abbas stated that there were closer to seventy major sins. Some of the major or al-Kaba'ir sins in Islam are as follows: The Major Sins Al- Kabirah By Muhammad bin 'Uthman Adh-Dhahabi, rendered into English by Mohammad Moinuddin Siddiqui #Shirk (associating partners with Allah) #Committing murder (killing a human being that Allah has declared inviolate without a just cause) #Practicing black magic #Leaving daily prayers (Salah) #Zakat evasion (not giving obligatory charity) #Not fasting on the days of Ramadan (without an excuse) #Not performing Hajj (while being able to do so) #Cutting off the ties of relationships #Committing Adultery or Fornication (Zina) #Committing Sodomy / homosexuality #Using intoxicants #Eating pigs meat or use any part of pigs #Taking or paying interest (Riba) #Consuming the property of an orphan #Lying about Allah and his messenger #Turning back when the army advances (running from the battlefield) #The unjust leader These seventeen references do not constitute all major sins in Islam, there are other fifty-four other notable major sins; some within this list also represent the opinions of particular scholars and so they do not perfectly represent Islam. Although many of the ideas for what is unacceptable overlap, the seven major sins of Islam differs from the seven deadly sins of Christianity. The Islamic sins refer more to specific undesirable behavior rather than to the general negative characteristics or actions of the cardinal Christian sins. Despite the similar names, the seven main sins in Islam are more comparable to the Ten Commandments rather than the seven deadly sins. They both provide the bottom line for believers in terms of what is acceptable behavior in the faith. The actions themselves differ most of the major crimes in Islam relate to subservience to Allah. Any form of polytheism is seen to be the most severe offense in the religion and all of the other transgressions are in some form of association with Allah. Witchcraft, for example, is the taking on of supernatural powers in order to make the practitioner a being above the normal human. This challenges the power of Allah as the person in question has superseded their mortal position to become something greater and akin to a god. The same can be said of murder, as ultimately the power to decide who shall live and die is believed to belong solely to Allah. Life is thought to be a gift from Allah and the unjust taking of life is a severe spiritual offense, as it is not only seen as morally wrong but also as an affront to God. In addition to what Muslim scholars agree are the principal seven sins, the idea exists that the major sins extend far past the seven. These additional transgressions, potentially up to seventy, are not universally settled upon nor are they explicitly stated in the Qur'an, however they are thought to be implied by the text. The supplementary sins as a whole lack the spiritual gravity of the original seven and include things such as drinking alcohol and eavesdropping.

Human beings were created because of God's immeasurable love for us. However, the Baháʼí teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God's love. It is only by turning unto God that the spiritual advancement can be made. In this sense, \\"sinning\\" is to follow the inclinations of one's own lower nature, to turn the mirror of one's heart away from God. One of the main hindrances to spiritual development is the Baháʼí concept of the \\"insistent self\\" which is a self-serving inclination within all people. Baháʼís interpret this to be the true meaning of Satan, often referred to in the Baháʼí Writings as \\"the Evil One\\". > Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One is lying in wait, ready to entrap > you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices, and, led by the light of > the name of the All-Seeing God, make your escape from the darkness that > surroundeth you. — Baháʼu'lláh > This lower nature in humans is symbolized as Satan — the evil ego within us, > not an evil personality outside. — ʻAbdu'l-Bahá Baháʼí Reference Library - > The Promulgation of Universal Peace, Pages 284-289 The Baháʼí concept of God is both just and merciful.

Baháʼís are meant to refrain from focusing on the sins of others, and are meant to have a \\"sin-covering eye\\".Baháʼí Reference Library - Directives from the Guardian, Pages 41-42 Baháʼís are also forbidden to confess their sins to others in order to have their sins removed. Forgiveness is between a person and God alone, and is thus a very personal affair. > Should anyone be afflicted by a sin, it behoveth him to repent thereof and > return unto his Lord. He, verily, granteth forgiveness unto whomsoever He > willeth, and none may question that which it pleaseth Him to ordain. He is, > in truth, the Ever-Forgiving, the Almighty, the All-Praised. — Baháʼu'lláh > Baháʼí Reference Library - The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Pages 34-49 Baháʼu'lláh taught that one should bring one's self to account each day, and be constantly concerned with self-improvement. Sin is an inevitable stumbling block, but it should not be allowed to halt one's spiritual progress. One should ask for forgiveness from God alone and then try to develop oneself through acquisition of virtues and communion with God (through prayer, fasting, meditation and other spiritual practices). There are many Baháʼí prayers for forgiveness of oneself, one's parents, and even the deceased. The Baháʼí Faith teaches that pardon can be obtained even in the afterlife and that deeds done in the name of the departed or wealth left by the departed for charity can benefit and advance their souls in the afterlife. The Baháʼí Faith accepts the Biblical teaching that the sin against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven, in this world or the world to come. > The Prophets of God are manifestations for the lordly perfections - that is, > the Holy Spirit is apparent in Them.

These were airbursts mostly occurring over water or suspended a few hundred metres above the ground by balloon. In Australia there were three sites. Testing was carried out between 1952 and 1957 and was mostly done at the surface. A few hundred smaller scale tests were conducted at both Emu Field and Maralinga between 1953 and 1963. =Monte Bello Islands= Two separate atomic test projects occurred at the islands, the first being Operation Hurricane and the second being Operation Mosaic.

Both the Federal government and Australian newspapers at the time were very supportive of the tests. In 1952, the Liberal Government passed legislation, the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952, which allowed the British Government access to remote parts of Australia to undertake atmospheric nuclear weapons tests. The general public were largely unaware of the risks from the testing program, stemming from official secrecy about the testing program and the remote locations of the test sites. Before the tests could begin the Maralinga Tjarutja, the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land, were forcibly removed. An air base at Woomera, 570 km away, which had been used for rocket testing, was initially used as a base from which planes were flown for testing of the bomb clouds. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" + Major tests at MaralingaMichael Carter et al.

Avon Hudson, an atomic veteran who participated as an Australian serviceman during the later stage Minor Trials became a prominent whistleblower. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged and political scrutiny became more intense. In June 1993, New Scientist journalist Ian Anderson wrote an article entitled \\"Britain's dirty deeds at Maralinga\\" and several related articles. Minor Trials Over a decade, 1953 to 1963, a series of \\"Minor Trials\\" occurred testing components of the Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs using in some instances highly radioactive materials, such as Plutonium, Beryllium, and Uranium. Most of the minor trials involved conventional explosions to map out the radioactive dispersion and contamination of military assets, building structures and early crash test dummies. The Minor Trial of Vixen A dispersing Plutonium over a wide area by conventional explosive was considered to have had the longest half-life of any test or trial conducted in Australia. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" + Minor trials name, location and radioactive material ----- ! style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Year ! style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Location ! style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  Trial ! style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Material ! style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Quantity (kg) ----- ! style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" colspan=\\"5\\"  -----  1953  Emu Field  Kitten  Beryllium  0.036 -----  1955  Naya 3  Tims  Uranium  13.8 -----  1955  Naya  Kittens  Uranium  5 -----  1955-57  Naya  Kittens  Beryllium  0.75 -----  1955-57  Kittens area  Kittens  Uranium  120 -----  1956-60  Kuli TM4  Tims  Uranium  6605 -----  1956-58  Naya 1  Rats  Uranium  151 -----  1957  Naya  Tims  Beryllium  1.6 -----  1957  Naya 3  Kittens  Uranium  23.4 -----  1957  Wewak  Vixen A  Uranium  67.8 -----  1957  Dobo  Rats  Uranium  28 -----  1957  Taranaki  Vixen B  Uranium  25 -----  1959  Wewak VK33  Vixen A  Plutonium  0.008 -----  1959  Wewak VK29  Vixen A  Beryllium  0.14 -----  1959  Wewak VK28  Vixen A  Beryllium  0.25 -----  1959  Wewak VK27  Vixen A  Beryllium  0.27 -----  1959  Wewak VK30  Vixen A  Beryllium  0.1 -----  1959-60  Kuli TM11  Tims  Beryllium  26.2 -----  1959-60  Kuli TM11  Tims  Uranium  67 -----  1960  Naya TM100  Tims  Plutonium  0.6 -----  1960-62  Naya 2  Kittens  Uranium  32 -----  1960-61  Kuli TM16  Tims  Beryllium  39 -----  1961  Kuli TM50  Tims  Uranium  90 -----  1961  Naya TM101  Tims  Plutonium  0.6 -----  1961  Wewak VK60A  Vixen A  Plutonium  0.294 -----  1961  Wewak VK60C  Vixen A  Plutonium  0.277 -----  1961  Wewak 60A  Vixen A  Beryllium  1.72 -----  1961  Wewak 60B  Vixen A  Beryllium  1.72 -----  1961-63  Taranaki  Vixen B  Beryllium  17.6 ----- } Opposition Opposition to the tests grew throughout the 1950s.

Gould (1998), Leonardo's Mountain of Clams and the Diet of Worms, , p. 274. Jonathan Cape, He suggests, with examples, that \\"NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism\\" and that it is \\"a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria.\\" Some have criticized the idea or suggested limitations to it, and there continues to be disagreement over where the boundaries between the two magisteria should be. Gould's separate magisteria In a 1997 essay \\"Non-overlapping Magisteria\\"Gould, S. J. (1997). \\"Nonoverlapping Magisteria\\". Natural History 106 (March 1997): 16–22 and 60–62. for Natural History magazine, and later in his book Rocks of Ages (1999), Gould put forward what he described as \\"a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to ... the supposed conflict between science and religion\\", from his puzzlement over the need and reception of the 1996 address of Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences \\"Truth Cannot Contradict Truth\\". He draws the term magisterium from Pope Pius XII's encyclical, Humani generis (1950), and defines it as \\"a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution\\", and describes the NOMA principle as \\"Science tries to document the factual character of the natural world, and to develop theories that coordinate and explain these facts. Religion, on the other hand, operates in the equally important, but utterly different, realm of human purposes, meanings, and values—subjects that the factual domain of science might illuminate, but can never resolve.\\" \\"These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry (consider, for example, the magisterium of art and the meaning of beauty).\\" Gould emphasized the legitimacy of each field of endeavor only within its appropriate area of inquiry: \\"NOMA also cuts both ways. If religion can no longer dictate the nature of factual conclusions residing properly within the magisterium of science, then scientists cannot claim higher insight into moral truth from any superior knowledge of the world's empirical constitution.\\" In the chapter \\"NOMA Defined and Defended\\" Gould gave examples of the types of questions appropriate to each area of inquiry, on the topic of \\"our relationship with other living creatures\\": \\"Do humans look so much like apes because we share a recent common ancestor or because creation followed a linear order, with apes representing the step just below us?\\" represents an inquiry concerning fact, while \\"Under what conditions (if ever) do we have a right to drive other species to extinction by elimination of their habitats? Do we violate any moral codes when we use genetic technology to place a gene from one creature into the genome of another species?\\" represent questions in the domain of values. He went on to present \\"an outline of historical reasons for the existence of conflict, where none should exist\\". In a speech before the American Institute of Biological Sciences, Gould stressed the diplomatic reasons for adopting NOMA as well, stating that \\"the reason why we support that position is that it happens to be right, logically. But we should also be aware that it is very practical as well if we want to prevail.\\" Gould argued that if indeed the polling data was correct—and that 80 to 90% of Americans believe in a supreme being, and such a belief is misunderstood to be at odds with evolution—then \\"we have to keep stressing that religion is a different matter, and science is not in any sense opposed to it\\", otherwise \\"we're not going to get very far\\".S. J. Gould (2000). \\"Evolution and the 21st Century\\". Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Biological Sciences. March 2000. He did not, however, consider this diplomatic aspect to be paramount, writing in 1997: \\"NOMA represents a principled position on moral and intellectual grounds, not a mere diplomatic stance.\\" In 1997 he had elaborated on this position by describing his role as a scientist with respect to NOMA: Ciarán Benson sees a tendency to re- negotiate the borders between the \\"human sciences and the natural sciences\\", as in Wilhelm Dilthey's 1883 claim for the distinction between Geisteswissenschaften (humanities) and Naturwissenschaften (science). The astrophysicist Arnold O. Benz proposes that the boundary between the two magisteria is in the different ways they perceive reality: objective measurements in science, participatory experience in religion.Arnold Benz. Astrophysics and Creation – Perceiving the Universe Through Science and Participation. Crossroad, New York 2016, 96-104 The two planes of perceptions differ, but meet each other, for example, in amazement and in ethics. National Academy of Sciences Also in 1999, the National Academy of Sciences adopted a similar stance. Its publication Science and Creationism stated that \\"Scientists, like many others, are touched with awe at the order and complexity of nature. Indeed, many scientists are deeply religious. But science and religion occupy two separate realms of human experience. Demanding that they be combined detracts from the glory of each.\\" Humani generis Gould wrote that he was inspired to consider non-overlapping magisteria after being driven to examine the 1950 encyclical Humani generis, in which Pope Pius XII permits Catholics to entertain the hypothesis of evolution for the human body so long as they accept the divine infusion of the soul. Gould cited the following paragraph: Reception Richard Dawkins has criticized Gould's position on the grounds that religion is not divorced from scientific matters or the material world. He writes, \\"it is completely unrealistic to claim, as Gould and many others do, that religion keeps itself away from science's turf, restricting itself to morals and values. A universe with a supernatural presence would be a fundamentally and qualitatively different kind of universe from one without. The difference is, inescapably, a scientific difference. Religions make existence claims, and this means scientific claims.\\" Gould's observation lthat \\"These two magisteria do not overlap\\" does not consider the claims of many religions upon material reality, such as miracles or prayer. Dawkins also argues that a religion free of divine intervention would be far different from any existing ones, and certainly different from the Abrahamic religions. Moreover, he claims that religions would be only too happy to accept scientific claims that supported their views. For example, if DNA evidence proved that Jesus had no earthly father, Dawkins claims that the argument of non-overlapping magisteria would be quickly dropped. The theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf has been sympathetic to the approach, but claims it for the theological side—Graf assumes that e.g. creationism may be interpreted as a reaction of religious communities on the Verweltanschaulichung (i.e. interpretation as a worldview) of (natural) science in social Darwinism. That said, attempts to compete with religion by natural science may generate a backlash, that is detrimental to both sides. The paper is based on a 2011 honor lecture at the Bavarian Academy of Science in Munich. Ciarán Benson, a secular humanist, defends the spiritual as a category against both. He assumes that while Gould claims for NOMA (non- overlapping magisteria of science, morality and religion), and Richard Dawkins for, verbally, \\"a brand of SM (bondage of the others by the scientific magisterium)\\", Benson preferred OM (overlapping magisteria), especially in the case of art and religion. Francis Collins criticized what he saw as the limits of NOMA, arguing that science, religion, and other spheres have \\"partially overlapped\\" while agreeing with Gould that morals, spirituality and ethics cannot be determined from naturalistic interpretation.Collins, Francis. The Language of God. Simon and Schuster, 2007. p. 95, 165 This exceeds the greatest interconnection allowed by Gould in his original 1997 essay \\"Nonoverlapping Magisteria\\" in which he writes: Matt Ridley notes that religion does more than talk about ultimate meanings and morals, and science is not proscribed from talking about the above either. After all, morals involve human behavior, an observable phenomenon, and science is the study of observable phenomena. Ridley notes that there is substantial scientific evidence on evolutionary origins of ethics and morality.

Synth is an abstract and procedurally generated 3D game, in which the graphics have an algorithmic C++ representation. Gameplay Synth is a strategic action game, in which the player must find an exit in a procedurally generated landscape. The player is equipped with a laser, bombs, and a device that acts as a vacuum or blower. The overall goal is to reach the highest level possible. Synth uses C++ algorithms to generate the level's structure and graphics. Levels are seeded from four-letter words: for example, \\"BGNI\\" is the first level. As the game does not need to store pre-rendered textures and model data, only small filesizes are required. Synths drum and bass synthesizer soundtrack dynamically changes during the game. The sounds were pre-composed by Hovey, but the player's controls are mapped to a loop-sequence remixer. Development right Hovey cites the artwork of Roger Dean (who produced the covers for several Psygnosis titles), other Amiga graphics, and Pink Floyd as influences for Synths imagery. Synth is currently only available as a game demo. Once a full version is ready, Hovey intends to acquire a digital distribution deal. Critical reception Todd Ciolek, an editor with Gamasutra made reference to the game's experimental design: \\"Rhys Paul Hovey’s SYNTH is an experimental game in many ways\\". Rock, Paper, Shotgun drew comparisons with the visuals of Darwinia and the procedural nature of .kkrieger. The graphics were described as fascinating: \\"a bizarre, mesmerizing cross between the deeply archaic and the thoroughly high-tech.\\" ModDB reviewed version 0.909 and praised the game's concept, describing the visuals as \\"crazy 3D Geometry Wars on acid\\". Criticisms included the poor frame rate, incomplete Vista 64-bit support and lack of a windowed mode.

He failed to make the grade at Villa and never appeared in the first team, before moving to local rivals West Bromwich Albion in June 1904. At Albion, he had to compete for the No. 5 shirt with Ted Pheasant and only made eight Second Division appearances in the 1904–05 season. As a result of a shooting accident in which a bullet passed through his left arm, he missed the entire 1905–06 season. By the time he was fit to play once more, Pheasant had become established at centre-half and Bowden was transferred to Southampton of the Southern League. At Southampton, he took over at centre-half from Bert Lee who had left during the close season after six years in which he hardly missed a match. Despite his lack of height, Bowden impressed the Saints' fans with his \\"stylish neatness when in possession\\". Bowden missed two months mid-season following an injury (when he was replaced by John Robertson) before returning at the end of January for the rest of the season.

A United States Navy aircraft carrier task force on its way to raid the Imperial Japanese military base at Rabaul, New Britain was attacked by a force of land-based bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The US task force was commanded by Admiral Wilson Brown and the Japanese aircraft forces were under the command of Eiji Gotō. In the ensuing engagement, the Japanese air group lost 15 of 17 bombers sent to attack the American carrier group. The United States lost only two fighters in defence, and no ships were damaged. As a result of the loss of surprise, however, the Americans retired without raiding Rabaul as originally planned. Because of the heavy losses in bombers, the Japanese were forced to delay their planned invasion of New Guinea, giving the Allies more time to prepare defences against the Japanese advances in the South Pacific. Prelude Following the capture of the port of Rabaul during the battle of Rabaul, Japanese forces proceeded to turn it into a major base. The allied command was concerned the fall of Rabaul threatened the San Francisco-Australia sea lane supply line and ordered the supply line to be patrolled. Admiral Chester William Nimitz and Admiral Brown devised a plan to solve the threat on the supply line by attacking the newly captured Rabaul. Task Force 11 (TF 11) and the ANZAC Squadron were tasked with undertaking the raid. Unfortunately, the ANZAC Squadron fuel oil supply was inadequate to accompany TF 11 to its launching point north-east of Rabaul for the planned 21 February air strike. Battle TF 11 with the carrier detected an unknown aircraft on radar from the ship at 1015 while still from the harbour at Rabaul. A six-plane combat patrol was launched with two fighters directed to investigate the contact. These two planes, under command of Lieutenant Commander Thach, shot down a four-engined Kawanishi H6K4 \\"Mavis\\" flying boat about out at 11.12. Two other planes of the combat patrol were sent to another radar contact ahead, and shot down a second \\"Mavis\\" at 12.02. A third contact was made out, but that plane reversed course and disappeared. The Japanese search planes alerted Rabaul to the presence of US naval forces in the area. Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue, at the Imperial Japanese Fourth Fleet headquarters in Truk, ordered an initial air strike to be conducted from Rabaul; and ordered the heavy cruisers , , , and of cruiser Division 6 to intercept TF 11\\\\. Seventeen Japanese Mitsubishi G4M1 \\"Betty\\" bombers of the 4th Kōkūtai took off from Vunakanau Airfield, Rabaul to attack TF 11\\\\. When Admiral Brown realised he had lost the element of surprise, he broke off the attack against Rabaul and started to retire from the area. A jagged vee signal was detected on air-search radar at 15.42. The contact was briefly lost, but reappeared at 16.25 west. Six Grumman F4F-4 Wildcats from Lexington were sent to intercept the incoming targets, while Lexington launched four more and another six, preparing to land, stood off to await developments. Their targets proved to be the 4th Kōkūtai's 2nd Chûtai,Shores, Cull, Izawa, pp. 186–188 led by Lieutenant Masayoshi Nakagawa. Five of the nine incoming \\"Bettys\\" were shot down or cut out of formation during the approach. One of these was Nakagawa's lead plane,Lundstrom, p.99 the loss of which caused a delay to the attack run while command was passed to the next ranking pilot. The remaining four \\"Bettys\\" then turned into their run, but were then set upon by the six standby fighters. This, combined with Captain Frederick C. Sherman's adroit ship- handling, caused their bombs to land 3,000 yards short of the carrier. Shortly afterwards, Nakagawa, still in control of his crippled plane, attempted to crash directly onto Lexington's flight deck. Sherman immediately put his stern to the attacker, while every available gun opened up on the incoming \\"Betty\\". Nakagawa's plane hit the water 75 yards astern of the carrier.Lundstrom, p.99 The remaining four \\"Bettys\\" attempted to clear the area, but were immediately swarmed by Wildcats. Three were shot down, at the cost of two F4Fs to return fire. The last managed to escape the fighters, but ran into an SBD piloted by VB-2's XO, Lieutenant Walter F. Henry. Henry overtook it and shot it down, leaving no survivors from the 2nd Chûtai.Lundstrom, pp.99-101. Of the two F4F pilots, Lt.(jg) Howard L. Johnson survived, while Ens. John W. Wilson was killed. A second formation of \\"Bettys\\" was detected by radar at 16.49,Shores, Cull, Izawa, pp. 186–189 out on the disengaged side of the task force.Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, p. 129. These were the 4th Kōkūtai's 1st Chûtai, led by the group CO, Lieutenant Commander Takuzo Ito.Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, p.124. In addition to Ito, the lead plane also carried the official 1st Chûtai leader, Lieutenant Yogoro Seto With the majority of fighters chasing the remains of the 2nd Chûtai, Ito's men were virtually unopposed. Only two Wildcats, flown by Lieutenant Edward \\"Butch\\" O'Hare and Lieutenant (junior grade) Marion Dufilho, were available to confront the intruders. The two F4F pilots flew eastward and arrived above eight \\"Bettys\\" (reported as nine) flying close together in V formation out at 1700. During the first pass, Dufilho's guns jammed, leaving O'Hare alone to protect the carrier from the enemy. O'Hare employed a high-side diving attack from the right side of the formation, accurately placing bursts of gunfire into the outside \\"Betty\\"'s right engineShores, Cull, Izawa, p. 189 and wing fuel tanks. When the stricken craft, commanded by Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryosuke Kogiku (3rd Shotai),Ewing and Lundstrom, p.130 lurched to starboard, O'Hare switched to the next plane up the line, that of Petty Officer 1st Class Koji Maeda (3rd Shotai leader).Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, p. 130 Maeda's plane caught fire, but his crew managed to put out the flames with \\"one single spurt of liquid...from the fire-extinguisher\\"Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, p. 130 Neither Maeda or Kogiku had sustained fatal damage, and would catch up with the group before bomb release. With two \\"Bettys\\" knocked out of formation (albeit temporarily), O'Hare initiated another firing pass, this time from the left side. His first target was the outside plane, flown by Petty Officer 1st Class Bin Mori (2nd Shotai). Aiming across to the far side of Mori's bomber, O'Hare's bullets damaged the right engine and left fuel tank, forcing Mori to dump his bombs and abort his mission.Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, p.131 With Mori out of combat, O'Hare next targeted Ito's senior wingman, Petty Officer 1st Class Susumu Uchiyama (1st Shotai),Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, p.131, whose plane did not recover from its dive. Having shot up four bombers, O'Hare returned to the left side for a third firing pass. By now, Ito was nearing the bomb release point, which left very little time to take action. The first plane to go down was Ito's deputy, Lieutenant (junior grade) Akira Mitani (2nd Shotai leader).Ewing and Lundstrom, 134. Mitani's departure left Ito's command plane exposed, and O'Hare opened up on it. O'Hare's concentrated fire caused the plane's port engine nacelle to break free of the wing. The resulting explosion was so violent that the 1st Chûtai pilots were convinced that an AA burst had struck their commander's plane.Lundstrom, p.103 With a gaping hole in its left wing, Ito's plane fell out of formation. Shortly afterwards, O'Hare made another firing pass against Maeda (who had now caught up), but ran out of ammunition before he could finish him. Frustrated, he pulled away to allow the ships to fire their anti-aircraft guns. O'Hare believed he had shot down six bombers and damaged a seventh. Captain Sherman would later reduce this to five, as four of the reported nine bombers were still overhead when he pulled out.Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, p.140 In fact, he had only shot down three bombers - Uchiyama's, Mitani's, and Ito's - a total backed up by his own CO. Lieutenant Commander John Thach, hurrying towards the scene with reinforcements after mopping up the 2nd Chûtai, arrived in time to see three enemy bombers falling in flames simultaneously.\\"Acepilots: Saving the Lexington\\" With Ito knocked out, the remaining four pilots dropped their bombs, three of them targeting Lexington. Despite the last-minute disruption, the 1st Chûtai had set up their run much better than the 2nd, planting their nearest bomb just 100 feet astern of Lexington.Lundstrom, p.104 Maeda, however, was unable to line up properly, and instead released his bombs on the cruiser Minneapolis. They missed 100 yards to port.Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, pp.135-136 As the surviving \\"Bettys\\" withdrew, Ito's command pilot, Warrant Officer Chuzo Watanabe,Group leader Takuzo Ito wasn't piloting his own \\"Betty\\". As per standard practice in the IJNAS, the pilot was an enlisted man and the commander of the plane was an observer and/or navigator.. managed to regain enough control to level his plane. He tried to steer his damaged plane into Lexington, but missed and flew into the water near the carrier at 17.12. Maeda, witnessing the event, believed that both Ito and Mitani (who had gone down moments earlier) had crashed \\"bombs, crew and all\\" into the carrier.Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, p.136 Although O'Hare could no longer shoot, the remaining 1st Chûtai pilots were not out of danger. A fourth, flown by Petty Officer 2nd Class Tokiharu Baba (2nd Shotai), was brought down eight miles out by Thach's wingman, Ensign Edward R. Sellstrom.Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, p.136 Of the remaining four, Petty Officer 1st Class Kosuke Ono (1st Shotai) was badly shot up during the retreat, and forced to crash-land on Nugava Island at 19.25 with several dead crewmembers.Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, pp.136-137 Maeda and Kogiku managed to reach Vunakanau at 19.50, while Mori, lost in a storm, ditched at Simpson Harbor at 20.10.Ewing and Lundstrom 1997, 136-137 Aftermath As a result of the loss of surprise, Brown cancelled the planned raid on Rabaul and retired from the area. Because of the high losses in bomber aircraft, the Japanese postponed their impending invasion of Lae-Salamaua, Papua New Guinea from 3–8 March 1942. Two \\"Mavis\\" flying boats were also shot down which were shadowing the US force, as well as two other Japanese scout aircraft lost in operational accidents while participating in the day's action. The US lost two fighters to defensive gunfire from the bombers, but one pilot survived, while no damage was inflicted on the US warships. US Navy pilot Edward O'Hare was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.

The film was shot in Los Angeles, California.  Plot  The film focuses on Second Lieutenant Bart Gregory (David Anders) who has been killed under mysterious circumstances in Iraq. After his friends and girlfriend Janet (Louise Griffiths) attend his funeral, Bart awakens in his grave. Enlisting the help of his best friend, Joey Leubner (Chris Wylde), Bart begins to understand and learn how to deal with his new undead state; mainly, the fact that Bart needs blood to hold back decomposition and that he returns to a state of in-animation during daylight hours. Joey does research online to find out what Bart is and seems to be stuck between a Zombie and Vampire, finally stating that Bart is a Revenant. While buying beer from a small store in Koreatown, Bart and Joey become vigilantes when Bart both kills and feeds off of a gangster who is holding up the store. They enjoy the media coverage of the incident, and Joey asks Bart to bestow him with the \\"dark gift\\". Bart refuses to do so and laughs the idea off. However, after a subsequent attempt at vigilantism goes wrong and Joey is fatally wounded, Bart is forced to drink Joey's blood in order to save him. The two continue their vigilante killing spree for a while, until Mathilda (Jacy King), a friend of Janet who dislikes both Bart and Joey, follows them and threatens to reveal their activities to the world, especially Janet. Joey shoots Mathilda through the chest, but before she dies, she is able to send the information to Janet. Fearing they will be caught, Joey tells Bart to meet him back at the apartment with a packed bag in half an hour, then drives away mysteriously. Bart meets a teary Janet at the apartment, who forces him to explain the fact that he requires blood to stay stable. She then begs him to feed off of her instead, so that he will no longer need to kill. Bart loses control and drains her until she dies. Joey returns to the apartment with a \\"pimped out\\" hearse for the two to use, and suggests that they go to Las Vegas to continue their reign. However, after Bart shows him Janet's corpse, the two begin to fight, and proceed to shoot each other repeatedly, although this is insufficient to kill either of them. Joey storms out and states that he will continue on to Vegas alone. Bart decapitates Janet in order to ensure her death, then drops her remains over the bridge where he and Joey usually disposed of their corpses. Bart is captured by SWAT teams and taken to jail, where, come dawn, he collapses in his cell. Upon nightfall, Bart reawakens in the morgue and escapes, returning to the apartment. Inside is a package containing Joey's severed head. Since he was decapitated at night, Joey is still \\"alive\\", and Bart uses a vibrating dildo to enable Joey's head to talk. Joey warns Bart that a gangbanger who was their first kill is after him for revenge, and then requests that Bart kill him for good. Bart crushes Joey's head underneath a bulldozer, and then tries to find a way to kill himself. Against normal convention, a bullet through the brain does not have the desired effect, and neither does hanging himself with Christmas lights. He even throws himself in front of the subway train, but only succeeds in severing his arm. Bart then boards a train, where he finds and reads a letter that Janet left in his uniform's pocket at his funeral. He breaks down and attacks the only other passenger. He is caught and flees into the station where more SWAT teams attempt to catch him. He finally escapes to a hilltop and at dawn collapses once more, while he is being surrounded by men in hazmat suits. The film then cuts to a tour of sorts, where various military personnel are being shown revenants in glass containers, including Bart. A General asks Bart if he was a soldier, and then states that this fact may give him an advantage. Bart is then shown in a large canister being airdropped into Khūzestān Province, Iran, along with the other revenants, where the canister opens upon landing, releasing him on the country. Cast *David Anders as Barthenoy (Bart) Gregory: Having come back from death as a revenant, Bart must deal with his new condition, a potential for a second chance on life, and trying to come to terms with the girlfriend that he had left behind. *Chris Wylde as Joey Leubner: As Bart's best friend, Joey acts as a partner and sidekick to Bart, providing him background of Bart's deteriorating condition, and encouraging him to act on his darker impulses in order to survive. *Louise Griffiths as Janet: Bart's love interest who is devastated after Bart's unexpected death. *Jacy King as Mathilda (Matty): A Wiccan nurse who is close friend to Janet, Matty acts as the voice of reason. *Emiliano Torres - Miguel *Senyo Amoaku – liquor store robber *Cathy Shim – Sophia Chang *David Ury – ATM robber *Wally White – The Minister *Zana Zefi – Ms. Rahmanov *Clint Jung - Marty  Development  The Revenant was written, directed, and produced by Kerry Prior, who also supervised the visual effects on the film. Liam Finn and Jacques Thelemaque were co-producers. The film was edited by Kerry Prior, though the opening credits state \\"image juxtaposition designer Walter Montague Urch\\". \\"Walter Montague Urch\\" could be a reference to Walter Map and Montague Summers, who have written about revenants and men who have returned from the dead.  Filming  Filming for The Revenant began in April 2008 in Los Angeles, California. The film is presented in 4K digital cinema with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 spherical.  Reception  The Revenant has received positive feedback from several film reviewers and the horror film community. A post- screening review from DreadCentral.com declared it is \\"sure to become a cult classic.\\" The film won the Audience Award for \\"Best Narrative Feature\\" at the 2009 CineVegas Film Festival, in Las Vegas. Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News wrote an early review, calling it \\"a great little genre film that gets exactly as nuts as one would hope a violent buddy flick can get with the undead.\\" Chris Alexander of Fangoria stated: \\"Forget Shaun of the Dead; this is the best dark fantasy/comedy I’ve seen since classic stuff I hold so dear to my heart, masterworks like Return of the Living Dead, Re-Animator, RoboCop and Fright Night.\\" Aaron Morgan from Fantastic Fest commented that \\"Overall this movie is a real gem and deserves a wide release here in the states to shake us out of this remake/retread horror trend.\\" Toronto After Dark listed The Revenant as one of the \\"10 Movies To See Before You Die\\". Awards Since its debut on the film festival circuit, The Revenant has won the following awards: *Xanadu Sci Fi and Horror Convention 2009: \\"Best Feature Film\\" *Zompire, The Undead Film Festival 2009: \\"Best Feature,\\" \\"Best Director\\" Kerry Prior; \\"Audience Award\\" *CineVegas 2009: \\"Audience Award, Best Narrative Feature\\" *Toronto After Dark Film Festival 2009: \\"Feature Film, Silver\\" *Fantastic Fest 2009: \\"Best Director,\\" Kerry Prior; \\"Audience Award (4th Place)\\" *ScreamFest, Los Angeles 2009: \\"Best Make Up,\\" \\"Best Special FX\\" *Vampire Film Festival, New Orleans 2009: \\"Outstanding Vampire Film\\" (1st Place) *Falstaff International Film Festival 2009: \\"Best of the Festival Award\\" *New York City Horror Film Festival 2009: \\"Best Picture,\\" Kerry Prior; \\"Best Director,\\" \\"Best Actor\\" (Tie: Chris Wylde, and David Anders), \\"Audience Choice\\" *Omaha Film Festival 2010: \\"Best Off the Edge Film\\" *A Night of Horror International Film Festival 2010: \\"Best Film\\", Best Director\\" (Kerry Prior) * Celluloid Screams: Sheffield Horror Film Festival 2010 \\"Audience Award: Best Feature Film\\" The film was also an \\"Official Selection\\" of the following film festivals: *Sitges 42nd International Film Festival 2009: Official Selection (10/09) *Chicago International Film Festival 2009: Official Selection (10/09) *Grimm Up North- UK 2009: Official Selection: (10/09) *Mar del Plata International Film Festival 2009: Official Selection (11/09) *Leeds International Film Festival- UK 2009: Official Selection (11/09) *Starz Denver International Film Festival 2009: Official Selection (11/09) *Stockholm International Film Festival 2009: Official Selection (11/09) References External links   Category:2009 films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American films Category:Vampires in film Category:American vigilante films Category:American zombie comedy films Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:English-language films ","title":"The Revenant (2009 film)"},{"id":"22771735","text":"Approximate extent of Dunedin's Town Belt, shown in green. Dunedin Town Belt includes both densely forested areas... ...and open parkland, like the Kensington Oval. The Town Belt is a green belt which surrounds the centre of the New Zealand city of Dunedin. Covering a total of over , it extends around three sides of the city's centre at a distance from it of some 1-3 km (1-2 mi) in a broad 7 km (4 mi) crescent from the Oval at Kensington in the south through the suburbs of Mornington, City Rise, Belleknowes, Roslyn, Maori Hill, Prospect Park, Glenleith, Woodhaugh, The Gardens and Dunedin North and the slopes of Signal Hill. The fourth side of the central city is bounded by the Otago Harbour. One of the world's oldest green belts, the Town Belt was planned in Scotland at the time of the advent of the Otago settlement in 1848.Herd, J. and Griffiths, G.J. (1980) Discovering Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe. , p. 116. Residential areas outside the belt became separate boroughs, and were not amalgamated with Dunedin until much later. The town belt now forms a break between the city's inner and outer suburbs. The belt was originally a combination of native bush and scrubland, but is now largely replanted forest and open parkland. Many species of plant can be found in the belt, including tree fuchsia, lemonwood, lancewood, manuka, and broadleaf, and the forested area is home to many species of birds, including some uncommon and endangered species such as the kereru, eastern rosella, bellbird, tomtit, tui, rifleman, morepork, and shining cuckoo, and kotare. A long, narrow road, Queens Drive, winds along much of the length of the belt and provides easy access to it for Dunedinites. Queens Drive is linked to many of the city's main streets, including Stuart Street and High Street. Numerous walkways lead through the bush and parks, and the belt is a popular recreation area for Dunedinites. The Town Belt includes many open areas and parks, including the Kensington Oval, Dunedin Southern Cemetery, Montecillo Ground, Unity Park, Mornington Ground, Jubilee Park, Belleknowes Golf Course, Robin Hood Park, Littlebourne Ground, Prospect Park, Woodhaugh Gardens, the North Ground, Dunedin Botanic Gardens, Dunedin Northern Cemetery, Logan Park, and the University Oval. Notable buildings and structures in the belt include Moana Pool, Olveston, Otago Boys' High School, and the Beverly-Begg Observatory.

At the time, Chancellor Lamont was criticized for being insensitive to the overall economic situation.'Green shoots' remarks defended , BBC News, 14 January 2009 The phrase was used again by Baroness Vadera, former Business Minister of the UK in January, 2009 to refer to signs of economic recovery during the late-2000s recession, again to criticism from the media and opposition politicians. The U.S. media started to use the phrase to describe domestic economic conditions in February 2009 when in New York Times quoted Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase as saying, \\"It's too early to get excited, but I think there are a couple of green shoots that say we're not going down as heavily in the first quarter [of 2009] as we were in the fourth quarter [of 2008].\\" The Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, made the first public use of the phrase by a Fed official in a March 15, 2009 interview with CBS 60 Minutes. Since February and March 2009, it has been used increasingly in the media to refer to positive economic data and statistics during the late-2000s (decade) recession.

Truman appointed four members of the Supreme Court of the United States: Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, Associate Justice Harold Burton, Associate Justice Tom C. Clark, and Associate Justice Sherman Minton. Harold Burton nomination When Supreme Court Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts retired in 1945, Truman decided to appoint a Republican as a bipartisan gesture. Truman had first met Harold Hitz Burton in 1941, when Burton was elected to the United States Senate, where Truman was then serving. Burton served with Truman on the Senate investigative committee that oversaw the U.S. war effort during World War II, and the two got along well. On September 19, 1945, Truman nominated Burton, who was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on the same day by voice vote, without hearing or debate.Supreme Court Nominations, 1789–present, senate.gov. Fred Vinson nomination Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone died in office on April 2, 1946. Rumors that Truman would appoint Robert H. Jackson as Stone's successor led several newspapers to investigate and report on a controversy between Justice Roberts and Justice Hugo Black arising from Black's refusal to recuse himself in Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Local 6167, United Mine Workers (1945).Roger K. Newman, Hugo Black (Fordham University Press) p. 333–334.John M. Ferren, Salt of the Earth, Conscience of the Court (UNC Press) p. 325. Black and Douglas allegedly leaked to newspapers that they would resign if Jackson were appointed Chief Justice. On June 6, 1946, Truman nominated Fred M. Vinson, an old friend, as Stone's replacement. Vinson was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 20, 1946 by voice vote. Tom Clark nomination The next vacancy occurred with the death of Justice Frank Murphy on July 19, 1949. On August 2, 1949, Truman nominated Attorney General Tom C. Clark. The New York Times called Clark \\"a personal and political friend [of Truman's] with no judicial experience and few demonstrated qualifications.\\"Eisler, Kim Isaac (1993). A Justice for All: William J. Brennan, Jr., and the decisions that transformed America. Page 76. New York: Simon & Schuster. Clark had held various position in the Justice Department during the Roosevelt Administration, and had met and become good friends with Truman during that time; when Truman became President, one of his first acts was to appoint Clark as Attorney General. After playing an active role in the effort to reelect Truman in 1948, Clark made clear to the White House that he was planning to return to Texas and the practice of law.Wohl, Father, Son and Constitution,pp. 127–28 Following Justice Murphy's sudden death, however, Truman nominated Clark to fill the vacancy, partly to bolster the majority of Chief Justice Fred Vinson, a former cabinet colleague and friend of Clark who, since his 1946 appointment by Truman, had failed to unify the Court.St. Clair, James and Guzin, Linda, Chief Justice Fred Vinson of Kentucky: A Political Biography, (Lexington; University Press of Kentucky, 2002) p. 184. Numerous attacks from across the political spectrum were leveled at the nomination, including charges of “cronyism,” a lack of judicial experience, and objections based in part on his work at the center of Truman’s anti-communist agenda and, specifically, the Attorney General’s List of Subversive Organizations. Former Roosevelt cabinet members Henry Wallace and Harold Ickes also leveled broadsides, for both personal and ideological reasons.Wohl, Father, Son and Constitution, pp. 131–32. Ickes said about Clark's nomination to the Court, \\"President Truman has not 'elevated' Tom C. Clark to the Supreme Court, he has degraded the Court.\\" Nevertheless, Clark was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 18, 1949 by a vote of 73–8. Sherman Minton nomination Truman's final opportunity to shape the Court came with the death of Wiley Blount Rutledge, also in 1949. Sherman Minton had previously served alongside Truman in the United States Senate, where the two had developed a close friendship. After Minton's 1940 Senate re-election bid had failed, President Roosevelt appointed him as a federal judge to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On September 15, 1949, Truman nominated Minton to the Supreme Court, and the nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 4, 1949 by a vote of 48–16.

It is said to have been invented in Europe in the late 18th century. Variations on the size of the board and the number of game pieces also exist.  Game rules  Both players start off with square arrangements of 16 game pieces in opposing corners of the gameboard. Each player's goal is to move all their pieces from the starting corner to the corner occupied by the opponent at the start of the game. Players take turns moving one game piece.

During his tenure at Tulane University, he improved its academic standards and financial health. The university had the highest percentage of African-American students among research universities at the time. He also lead the sports program through a scandal. Following the university presidency, Kelly was heavily involved in service work, including being chairman of the National Science Board. Early life and education Kelly was born on April 25, 1936, in the Bronx, New York City, as the son of Irish immigrants. He attended Fordham University on a football scholarship, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in 1958. Subsequently, Kelly enrolled at Columbia University where he completed a Ph.D. in the field of economics in 1965. While earning his Ph.D., Kelly taught undergraduate courses at Fordham and was a major influence on Mario Gabelli, who later became a billionaire fund manager.http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2015/10/mib-mario-gabelli-of-gamco/ Academic and administrative career Following completion of his Ph.D., Kelly became an assistant professor at the Pennsylvania State University. In 1969, Kelly joined the Ford Foundation, where he was Officer-in-Charge for the Office of Social Development from 1969 to 1974 and later for Program Related Investments from 1974 to 1979. He served as the city council president of Englewood, New Jersey from 1974–77, which political experience he recounted as useful preparation for his duties as a university president. Kelly became the chief financial officer and executive vice president of Tulane University in 1979. Following the resignation of Tulane University President Sheldon Hackney in 1980, Kelly became interim president of the university and permanent president the following year. As university president, Kelly stabilized and improved the university's finances without significant negative impact on the university's staff. He ended the university's practice of perennially draining the endowment to make up for budget deficits. As a result, the endowment of Tulane University grew substantially during Kelly's tenure, from US$50 million to US$406 million. Kelly is credited with modernizing the financial aid programs of Tulane University, rendering it more accessible to middle-income families. Additionally, as university president, he reformed the university's nondiscrimination policy for hiring faculty and recruiting students. As a result of his actions, the university became noted for having the highest percentage of African-American students of any major private research university in the United States at the time. Outside of academia, Kelly was widely known for shutting down the men's basketball program in 1985 due to a well-publicized point-shaving scandal. Several players, including future NBA star John \\"Hot Rod\\" Williams, had been plied with cocaine in order to induce them to shave points for gambling purposes. This revelation, combined with reports of academic irregularities, led Kelly to close the program in order to \\"demonstrate unambiguously this academic community's intolerance of the violations and actions we have uncovered.\\" As it turned out, several faculty members were so outraged by the extent of the misconduct that they demanded Tulane drop athletics altogether. They were only appeased when Kelly disbanded the basketball team. Kelly was widely praised for his decision; for example, Armen Keteyian of Sports Illustrated wrote that as draconian as the decision was, the misconduct was so egregious that only \\"the most drastic measure\\" was appropriate. Kelly initially did not intend to ever allow men's basketball to return to Tulane; when asked if he was willing to consider reinstating the program, he replied, \\"Permanent means permanent.\\" However, he relented in 1988 after several students convinced him that they were being punished for something that occurred when they were not enrolled at Tulane. On his retirement from the university presidency in 1998, Kelly became president emeritus and served as a faculty member at Tulane University. Public service and philanthropic work In 1998, Kelly co-founded with William E. Bertrand the Payson Center in International Development at the Tulane University School of Law. Its mission is to research the role of information communication technologies in sustainable human development. Since 1998, Kelly continued to serve on various philanthropic and government boards, with special focus on science and technology and on the developing world, especially Africa. He was particularly involved with helping a school in northern Uganda that was under threat of violence, and he spent about two months per year on the African continent. On August 2, 1996, U.S. President Bill Clinton nominated Kelly to the National Science Board, which oversees the National Science Foundation. The U.S. Senate confirmed Kelly on May 1, 1997 to a term expiring on May 10, 2002. On May 6, 1998, the National Science Board elected Kelly as chair and re-elected him in May 2000.https://web.archive.org/web/20000830201734/http://www.nsf.gov:80/nsb/meetings/1998/may/opensess.doc He was the first social scientist to hold this position. Awards and honors In 1997, Kelly received the Louisiana NAACP State Conference Distinguished Service Award. He was awarded the 1998 National Arts Club Centennial Medal for Contributions to Education and Humanity in 1998. He was the 1999 recipient of the Caring CItizens for the Humanities Award from the International Council for Caring Communities in 1999. He received the 1998 Louisiana Human Rights Campaign Award in 1996. Kelly received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Jackson State University in 2008. Personal life Kelly and his wife Margaret were married in 1963. They had three children, Paul, Andrew, and Peter. Their eldest son, Martin, died in a car accident in 1983 at the age of 19. Kelly resided in New Orleans from 1979 until his death on June 28, 2017, at Tulane University Medical Center. He is survived by his wife, three children, and nine grandchildren in New Orleans, Louisiana, and California. Selected publications * Kelly, E. M.

Besides his academic work, he is also a frequent commentator on current affairs in newspapers such as the South China Morning Post and Haaretz.  Published works  His first book, Shanghai's Bund and Beyond (Yale UP, 2008), is the first comparative study of foreign banking in prewar China. The book surveys the impact of British overseas bank notes on China's economy before the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Focusing on the two leading British banks in the region (Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China), it assesses the favourable and unfavourable effects of the British presence in China, with particular emphasis on Shanghai, and traces instructive links between the changing political climate and banknote circulation volumes. Drawing on recently declassified archival materials, Niv Horesh revises previous assumptions about China's prewar economy, including the extent of foreign banknote circulation and the economic significance of the May Thirtieth Movement of 1925. Horesh's second book Chinese Money in Global Context (Stanford UP 2013, Economics and Finance Series) makes for a China- centered examination of the evolution of money and finance around the world since the birth of coinage in Lydia (in what is today western Turkey) and up to the present.

Four marked Interpretive Walk Trails traverse the park: (1) Butterflies, Birds and Bridges Loop, (2) Woodloes Walk, (3) Banksia Hill Loop, and (4) Lagoon to Living Streams. The local council (the City of Canning) and the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) are responsible for providing well designed recreation areas without detracting from the natural values of the park. Vehicle access is provided for formal parking and emergency services. The park may also be accessed by pedestrians, bicycles, boats, canoes and wheel chairs. Unfortunately uncontrolled vehicle and pedestrian access has severely degraded some areas. =Kent Street Weir and Wilson Park= This area of the park has by far the most developed parking, toilet, boating and canoe access as well as picnic facilities (including barbecues). There is also an \\"eco\\" center which houses historical and ecological information, as well as being the location for environmentally focussed educational activities. The river can be crossed via the pedestrian bridges Kent Street Weir Bridge and Greenfield Street Bridge, providing access to large areas of the park. Each year, Western Australia Day is an open day at the park, with exhibits, children's activities, animals, guided walks in the regional park and Western Australia Day commemoration. Many of these activities are free for all to enjoy, and make a great family activity. =Leisure activities= Every Saturday at 8a.m., a free timed run takes place at Canning River Regional Park. The event is known as Canning River parkrun. =Castledare Miniature Railway= Castledare has extensive facilities, including over of track, railway station, signal box, turn table, storage sheds and workshops.

Bicycle and pedestrian access to the rest of the park is via the pedestrian bridge across Bannister Creek connecting the western and eastern portions of Adenia Road, and then via Bursaria Crescent and Ferndale Crescent across Lambertia Creek. The Australian Sikh Heritage Trail is located at Adenia Reserve. Maintenance and conservation Both City of Canning and DEC are responsible for sections of the park, and are responsible for maintaining the facilities and infrastructure in the area. In order to maintain and restore the environmental values of the park, activities including weeding and re-vegetation (and hand watering during summer) are not only carried out by paid labour, but by volunteer groups. Much of the work done in the park is by the Canning River Regional Park Volunteers consisting mostly of locals of all ages. The volunteer group's aims are to promote the Canning River Regional Park as a place of conservation and passive recreation, and to carry out activities which enhance the natural values of the area.SERCUL Canning River Regional Park Volunteers (CRRPV), CRRP VolunteersCanning River Regional Park Volunteers, Official CRRP Volunteers Website Many projects are ongoing to transform the degraded sections of the park by the reintroduction of native species and providing public access in a safe and sustainable manner.

Active for less than sixteen months, the U.S. Army camp was used to train combat engineers during World War II and was named for Henry Larcom Abbot. A large part of site is now Sunriver Resort, and the rest has been incorporated into the Deschutes National Forest. The only remaining structure from Camp Abbot is the officers' mess hall; now part of the resort and known as the Great Hall, it is used for large conferences and special events.  Site history  In 1855, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis dispatched an Army Corps of Topographical Engineers survey party to look for a railroad route from the Sacramento Valley in California to the Columbia River in the Oregon Territory. This required the party to survey the Deschutes River area in central Oregon. The survey party was led by two lieutenants, Robert Stockton Williamson and Henry Larcom Abbot.Abbot, Charles Greeley, Biographical Memoir of Henry Larcom Abbot, National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1929.Jette, Melinda, \\"Mount Jefferson and Black Butte\\", Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, 2003. The Williamson-Abbot survey party included a geologist-botanist, a physician-naturalist, several assistant engineers, a computation specialist, a pack master, and eighteen mule packers. At Fort Reading, a military escort of eighty infantrymen and twenty cavalry troopers joined the party. The escort was commanded by Lieutenant H. G. Gibson with Lieutenants George Crook and Philip H. Sheridan leading elements of the detachment. While in central Oregon, illness forced Williamson to return to California, which left Abbot in charge of the expedition. On 4 September 1855, Abbot and a detachment of the survey party camped along the Deschutes River, near the site of the future Camp Abbot. He completed the survey of central Oregon, crossed the Cascade Mountains into the Willamette Valley, and then returned to Fort Reading, arriving in mid-November 1855. The Army published Abbot's thorough 499-page report in 1857 under the title Report of Lieut. Henry L. Abbot Upon Explorations for a Railroad Route from Sacramento Valley to the Columbia River.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 140.  World War II  During World War II, the Army needed to rapidly expand its combat engineer training. On 4 December 1942, the War Department established a combat engineer replacement and training center in central Oregon, along the Deschutes River south of Bend. It was named in honor of Brigadier General Henry Larcom Abbot, who had led a survey party through the area in 1855. The first trainees arrived at Camp Abbot in March 1943, even before the camp was formally dedicated on 2 September 1943.\\"Here Come the Servicemen: Oregon Military Facilities\\", Life on the Home Front Oregon Responds to World War II, online exhibit, Oregon State Archives, Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, 2008.\\"History\\" , Sunriver Visitor Guide, Sunriver Publishing, Bend, Oregon, 10 May 2009.

Approximately 10,000 soldiers were trained during each 17-week cycle, with training conducted in three phases. The first part of the course focused on rifle marksmanship and other basic combat skills. The first phase also included special training on hand grenades, anti- tank mines, and other combat engineering tasks. The second phase was demolition training. During that phase, trainees learned how to build and destroy bridges and other structures. The final phase was three weeks of field maneuvers carried out under combat conditions. Over 90,000 combat engineers were trained at Camp Abbot before the center was closed in June 1944, shortly after the D-Day landings. Most of the camp structures were demolished shortly after the training center closed.\\"Sunriver History\\" , Deschutes County Government, www.co.deschutes.or.us, Bend, Oregon, 10 May 2009.  Post-war development  The officers' mess is now the Great Hall at Sunriver Resort (shown in 2007) In the years following the war, a portion of the camp property was returned to the U.S. Forest Service, but approximately were sold as private land. That property changed hands a number of times, until it was purchased by John Grey in 1965. Grey began development of Sunriver Resort, selling the first residential lots in 1968. Today, Sunriver is a luxury resort with a 250-room lodge, three golf courses, six restaurants, and an executive airport. There are approximately 4,000 homes on the adjacent Sunriver property along with a small commercial district that supports the shopping needs of the community.\\"The Resort\\", Sunriver Resort, www.sunriver-resort.com, Sunriver, Oregon, 10 May 2009. Alpine skiing is nearby at Mount Bachelor.  Original structures  Today, only one original Camp Abbot building remains. The officers' mess hall was built in 1943 by the Army Corps of Engineers under the direction of Captain John V. Banks. It remains at its original location as Sunriver Resort's Great Hall, used for large conferences and special events, such as banquets and weddings. General Patch Bridge in 2008 The historic Great Hall is an impressive log structure measuring , constructed with native stone and logs cut near the building site. It has a high ceiling with exposed beams, a large stone fireplace, and a balcony overlooking the main floor. There are also small side rooms including an intimate fireside room and a number of conference rooms. In 1993, Sunriver Resort completed a major renovation of the historic Great Hall, and it is now a modern facility with unique architectural character. The only other Camp Abbot structure to survive for an extended period was the General Patch Bridge which was constructed in 1943 by Army engineers during the Oregon Maneuver. The Oregon Maneuver was the largest military field exercise ever conducted in the Pacific Northwest. Named for General Alexander M. Patch, who led it, the maneuver involved over 100,000 army troops, many of them combat engineers based at Camp Abbot. The maneuver extended across six eastern Oregon counties. Camp Abbot was used as the exercise headquarters because of its central location and military infrastructure.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

In intuitive terms, the cancellation property asserts that from an equality of the form a·b = a·c, where · is a binary operation, one can cancel the element a and deduce the equality b = c. In this case the element being cancelled out is appearing as the left factors of and and hence it is a case of the left cancellation property. The right cancellation property can be defined analogously. Prototypical examples of cancellative semigroups are the positive integers under addition or multiplication. Cancellative semigroups are considered to be very close to being groups because cancellability is one of the necessary conditions for a semigroup to be embeddable in a group. Moreover, every finite cancellative semigroup is a group. One of the main problems associated with the study of cancellative semigroups is to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for embedding a cancellative semigroup in a group. The origins of the study of cancellative semigroups can be traced to the first substantial paper on semigroups, . Formal definitions Let S be a semigroup. An element a in S is left cancellative (or, is left cancellable, or, has the left cancellation property) if implies for all b and c in S. If every element in S is left cancellative, then S is called a left cancellative semigroup. Let S be a semigroup. An element a in S is right cancellative (or, is right cancellable, or, has the right cancellation property) if implies for all b and c in S. If every element in S is right cancellative, then S is called a right cancellative semigroup. Let S be a semigroup. If every element in S is both left cancellative and right cancellative, then S is called a cancellative semigroup. Alternative definitions It is possible to restate the characteristic property of a cancellative element in terms of a property held by the corresponding left multiplication and right multiplication maps defined by and . An element a in S is left cancellative if and only if La is injective. An element a is right cancellative if and only if Ra is injective. Examples #Every group is a cancellative semigroup. #The set of positive integers under addition is a cancellative semigroup. #The set of nonnegative integers under addition is a cancellative monoid. #The set of positive integers under multiplication is a cancellative monoid. #A left zero semigroup is right cancellative but not left cancellative, unless it is trivial. #A right zero semigroup is left cancellative but not right cancellative, unless it is trivial. #A null semigroup with more than one element is neither left cancellative nor right cancellative. In such a semigroup there is no element that is either left cancellative or right cancellative. #Let S be the semigroup of real square matrices of order n under matrix multiplication. Let a be any element in S. If a is nonsingular then a is both left cancellative and right cancellative. If a is singular then a is neither left cancellative nor right cancellative. Finite cancellative semigroups It is an elementary result in group theory that a finite cancellative semigroup is a group. Let S be a finite cancellative semigroup. Cancellativity and finiteness taken together imply that for all a in S. So given an element a in S, there is an element ea, depending on a, in S such that . Cancellativity now further implies that this ea is independent of a and that for all x in S. Thus ea is the identity element of S, which may from now on be denoted by e. Using the property one now sees that there is b in S such that . Cancellativity can be invoked to show that ab = e also, thereby establishing that every element a in S has an inverse in S. Thus S must necessarily be a group. Furthermore, every cancellative epigroup is also a group. Embeddability in groups A commutative semigroup can be embedded in a group (i.e., is isomorphic to a subset of a group) if and only if it is cancellative. The procedure for doing this is similar to that of embedding an integral domain in a field, . See also Grothendieck group, the universal mapping from a commutative semigroup to abelian groups that is an embedding if the semigroup is cancellative. For the embeddability of noncommutative semigroups in groups, cancellativity is obviously a necessary condition. However, it is not sufficient: there are (noncommutative and infinite) cancellative semigroups that cannot be embedded in a group.A. Malcev, On the Immersion of an Algebraic Ring into a Field, Mathematische Annalen 1937, Volume 113, Issue 1, pp 686-691 To obtain a sufficient (but not necessary) condition, it may be observed that the proof of the result that a finite cancellative semigroup S is a group critically depended on the fact that Sa = S for all a in S. The paper generalized this idea and introduced the concept of a right reversible semigroup. A semigroup S is said to be right reversible if any two principal ideals of S intersect, that is, Sa ∩ Sb ≠ Ø for all a and b in S. The sufficient condition for the embeddability of semigroups in groups can now be stated as follows: (Ore's Theorem) Any right reversible cancellative semigroup can be embedded in a group, . The first set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the embeddability of a semigroup in a group were given in . Though theoretically important, the conditions are countably infinite in number and no finite subset will suffice, as shown in . (Accessed on 11 May 2009) A different (but also countably infinite) set of necessary and sufficient conditions were given in , where it was shown that a semigroup can be embedded in a group if and only if it is cancellative and satisfies a so-called \\"polyhedral condition\\". The two embedding theorems by Malcev and Lambek were later compared in .

Constructed in 1988 for television producer Aaron Spelling, it is the largest home in Los Angeles County. It was subsequently owned by British heiress Petra Ecclestone, daughter of Formula One racing magnate Bernie Ecclestone. Ecclestone purchased the home in 2011 for $85 million after it had been on the market for two years with an asking price of $150 million, making it the most expensive residential real estate listing in the US at the time.\\"The $150 Million Spelling Manor, Los Angeles, California\\" . Forbes. In June 2019, The Manor sold to an anonymous buyer for $119.7 million, the sale set a new record as the highest sale in California history. Description The Manor is a French chateau-style mansion has 123 rooms, with 27 bathrooms and 14 bedrooms and of space on more than . It is the largest home in Los Angeles County. Aaron Spelling—widely known as the television producer of series including Dynasty, Charlie's Angels, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, 7th Heaven, Melrose Place, Beverly Hills, 90210 and Charmed—built The Manor as his private residence. Designed by architects James Langenheim & Associates and built in 1988 at a cost of $12 million, the two-story house is high with a basement and an intermediate level for closets between the second story and attic. The house includes a screening room, gym, bowling alley, three rooms for wrapping presents, four two-car garages, tennis court, and pool. The parking lot accommodates 100 vehicles, and there are also 16 carports. Spelling razed the mansion that previously occupied the site which was built in 1932 by Gordon Kaufmann and was later owned by Bing Crosby. =Detailed description= The foyer has a grand twin butterfly staircase, marble flooring, crystal floating castle chandelier, Renaissance-style paintings and striking touches of black and white color make up the grandiose foyer. A massive bathroom with a soaking tub, cove ceiling and three wall-length vanity mirrors make up just one of the home’s 16 bathrooms. There bathroom also has a heart shaped mirror,which can be seen in several rooms and is one of Ecclestone’s touches. The beauty salon is a huge room that used to house Candy’s expansive doll collection has been transformed into a hair salon and spa area for relaxing. There’s even a mounted flat screen TV and magazine rack. The dining room features an elongated dining table, situated in the middle of a rectangular-shaped room and below a low-hanging crystal chandelier. The Manor has its very own two-lane bowling alley and its own shoe closet, with enough shoe sizes for everyone. The theater has two tiers of comfy lounge seating, carpeted flooring, coffered ceiling and a movie screen that rises from the floor. Other notable features include two walk in closets,a gigantic kitchen, a granite motor court for 100 cars, solarium, wine cellar, game room, gym and tanning rooms. Located on the 4.7 acres of gated Holmby Hills land are a citrus orchard, vegetable garden, koi pond, rose gardens and formal gardens.Also located here is a full tennis court, fountains and statues. Controversy and critical reception At the time of its construction, the project spawned a controversy over its massive size and ostentatious architecture. In April 1988, the Los Angeles Times asked: > What's bigger than a football field, smaller than Hearst Castle, has a > bowling alley and an entire floor of closets, and is making some people very > annoyed? Aaron and Candy Spelling's mansion in Holmby Hills. The French > chateau, under construction now for two years, has turned the corner of > Mapleton and Club View drives into a gawker's paradise. Sprawled across on > what once was the Bing Crosby estate, the house dwarfs the sizable mansions > on the block and looms large over tranquil Holmby Park near Wilshire > Boulevard. After its completion, Los Angeles Times architecture critic Sam Hall Kaplan panned the structure as one of the region's worst projects built in the 1980s: > Aaron Spelling residence, which at , should be considered a congregate > living facility and not a single-family home, and therefore in violation of > Holmby Hills zoning. In popular culture The Spelling mansion has also been referenced in popular culture. People magazine ran a feature on the massive home, and performer John Perry composed a calypso/rap novelty song about the house called \\"The Ballad of Aaron and Candy (An Ode to Spelling's Dwelling)\\". Some of the lyrics were: > See Candy's jewels, see Aaron's money, Aaron doesn't think being picked on > is funny. See Candy's clothes, see Aaron's pad See Aaron and Candy's castle > make the neighbors mad. But they're livin' in splendor high above the crowds > 60,000 square feet of heaven. That's Spelling's dwelling, I said Spelling's > Dwelling.... In the movie Legally Blonde, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) described her social standing to Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis) this way: \\"I grew up in Bel Air , Warner. Across the street from Aaron Spelling.\\" In the sitcom Will & Grace several episodes of season five make reference to \\"a gift- wrapping room like Candy Spelling has\\". Recent status Spelling died in the mansion on June 23, 2006, from complications of a stroke, at age 83. The house was discussed in his obituary: > Mr. Spelling himself, though a self-effacing and extremely shy man in > private, put his own vast wealth on display in the late 1980s when he and > his wife, Candy, supervised the construction of their home in the Holmby > Hills section of Los Angeles. The structure, which like his shows drew > mostly scathing reviews, eventually contained 123 rooms over about . It was > said to include a bowling alley, an ice rink and an entire wing devoted to > his wife's wardrobe. The Manor was listed for sale in 2009 at an asking price of $150 million—making it the most expensive home listing in America. When the house was listed, Candy Spelling called it the \\"greatest entertainment house ever\\" with a \\"kitchen where you can cook for two or 800\\". In her 18 years living at The Manor, Spelling recalled, \\"All the stars came through, Prince Rainier, Prince Charles, Jackie Kennedy—every star from every one of Aaron's shows.\\" On July 14, 2011, the house was sold to 23-year-old socialite Petra Ecclestone, daughter of Formula One racing magnate Bernie Ecclestone for $85 million—one of the largest real estate sales in Los Angeles County. The sale was brokered by celebrity real estate agent Sally Forster Jones along with Rick Hilton and Jeff Hyland. Subsequently the chandeliers, wall lights and fireplace mantels were removed by the new owner and the interior was updated. But by July 2014, it was reported that she was looking to sell the mansion for $150 million. In October 2016, the Manor was relisted with Rick Hilton and David Kramer of Hilton & Hyland with an asking price of $200 million. In February 2017, it was reported that singer Beyoncé and her husband Hip-hop mogul Jay Z had secretly visited the property.

Set in the Orkney islands during the 1st century BC, the story is an imaginative reconstruction of the development of the broch, the circular stronghold design of fortifications that dot the islands. The main character is a lame young dreamer who turns his fear of the Roman slave-raiders into a strength, not only for himself, but for all the islanders. Hunter won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. Setting The action is set on the largest of the Orkney islands (now known as Mainland). At the time of the story it is largely settled by the tribe of the Boar (Ork in their language), but the original inhabitants, the tribes of the Deer and the Raven, still live on the island, more numerous all together than the people of the Boar but divided by old rivalries. The tribe of the Boar is matrilineal, the Chief coming to power through his marriage to the former Chief's oldest daughter. The power of the Druids, maintained through ritual and secrecy, is still strong. The Roman Republic is extending its influence outwards, and invasion is feared. Meanwhile, the Roman civilisation requires ever more slaves, hence the raids that have been going on for decades. Plot summary The novel opens on the day when over seven hundred Men of the Boar from many islands gather together, summoned by the chief Nectan. Nectan puts forth the proposal that the warriors should no longer fight the Roman raiders but rather retreat when they approach, as the tribe's very existence is threatened by their losses. The Chief Druid strongly opposes the idea, saying they must continue to fight; he declares it a matter of faith and therefore his domain, directly challenging Nectan's leadership. Coll is convinced that his idea of a high circular drystone stronghold, designed to be impregnable, is a third way. He has been developing the idea, drawing plans and building models, since he was five, when a Roman raider killed his father, abducted his mother and shattered Coll's leg, crippling him. However, none of the elders will listen to him. Taran arrives, introducing himself as a member of the tribe who was seized for a slave when he was twelve and recently escaped by killing his master. He is welcomed, but it soon appears that he has a desire for power, seeking first to ingratiate himself with the chief's daughter and then plotting with the Druids and the chiefs of the Raven and the Deer. Coll's brother Bran, who lives with the Druids, is torn between the two camps. The struggle between Nectan and Domnall for mastery of the tribe culminates in Domnall choosing Nectan's daughter Fand for a human sacrifice. Coll, who loves Fand, takes the advice of Bran on how to stop the sacrifice, believing that he will die in her place. In fact it is Bran who dies, fulfilling the prophecy made about him when he was a baby and devastating Domnall who loved him like a son. In the wake of these events, Coll is given leave to build his Stronghold. The whole tribe works long and hard to build the 8-storey structure, and it is ready just before the first raid of the summer. The warriors prepare to defend it while the other tribespeople go into hiding. The first assault is repulsed, though Domnall is downed while shouting curses in Latin at the Romans. Taran, who also knows Latin, takes his place, but though pretending to curse, actually advises the Romans to make a second attack overland. When Taran's treachery is exposed, Coll devises a plan to trap the Romans that is extremely successful. His Stronghold is vindicated and plans are made to build more, all over the islands. Characters *Coll, a 17-year-old Man of the Boar, lame since childhood, Nectan's foster-son *Nectan, the Chief of the Boar *Anu, the wife of Nectan, daughter of the former Chief, leader of the womenfolk *Clodha, Nectan's older daughter *Fand, Nectan's younger daughter *Niall, Coll's best friend, Clodha's intended husband *Domnall, the Chief of the islands' priesthood of Druids *Bran, Coll's younger brother, raised by the Druids, prophesied to be a child of destiny *Taran, an ambitious ex-slave *Arcon, the Chief of the Deer *Deva, the Chief of the Raven Themes In the Foreword, the author describes the Orkney brochs, structures which have no parallel anywhere in the world. She recalls standing in one of the brochs, ten years earlier, wondering how they came to be built and considering that because of their uniqueness they must have sprung from an idea in a single brilliant mind. The idea, and how it came to be realised, is the fundamental theme of the book. Another theme, developed through the attitude of Coll and others to his lameness, is the recognition of the importance of the intellect in a world that places a high value on physical prowess. The novel also presents the conflict between the temporal and religious powers, which has a universal significance.

This document lists recommended actions that they asked all Christians to join them in: * \\"Affirming the teaching of the Christian Scriptures that God has not rejected the community of Israel, God's covenant people (), since 'the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable' (); * Renouncing interpretations of Scripture which foster religious stereotyping and prejudice against the Jewish people and their faith; * Seeking genuine dialogue with the broader Jewish community, a dialogue built on mutual respect and the integrity of each other's faith; * Lifting our voices quickly and boldly against all expressions of anti-Semitism; * Educating ourselves and others on the history of Jewish-Christian relations from the first century to the present, so as to understand our present by learning from our past. * Commit ourselves to rigorous consideration of appropriate forms of Christian witness for our time. United Church of Canada The United Church of Canada issued a statement in May 1998 entitled \\"Bearing Faithful Witness: United Church-Jewish Relations Today.\\" This calls upon Christians to: * Stop trying to convert Jews to Christianity; Reject Biblical interpretations which negatively stereotype Jews, as this leads to anti-Semitism; Reject the idea that Christianity is superior to, or a replacement for, Judaism; recognize that anti-Semitism is an element of historic Christianity, but not an inherent part of it - therefore one can remove it from Christianity and still remain faithful to Christianity. Bearing Faithful Witness, has continued within the Church as a study program; on August 13, 2003, the 38th General Council of The United Church of Canada received a new report from Bearing Faithful Witness; it then approved a statement on relations with Jews today. Their report states, in part, \\"No other religion is as closely related to Christianity as Judaism. The Christian God is the God of Israel. Jesus and all the apostles were of Israel (see Jewish Christians). Christian scripture includes the scriptures of Israel.\\" They call for no longer seeking the conversion of Jews. The statement, United Church-Jewish Relations Today, \\"acknowledges a history of interpreting the New Testament in a way that has failed to acknowledge the context within Judaism in which many passages are rooted; rejects all teaching of contempt toward Jews and Judaism and the belief that God has abolished the covenant with the Jewish people; affirms the significance of Judaism as a religion, a people, and a covenant community and that the State of Israel has the right to exist in peace and security.\\" See also * Protestantism and Islam * Mormonism and Judaism ReferencesSources * Martin Brecht; tr.

In agreement with many official Christian declarations, we reject this accusation as historically false and theologically invalid. It suggests that God can be unfaithful to the eternal covenant with the Jewish people. We acknowledge with shame the suffering this distorted portrayal has brought upon the Jewish people.... We believe that revising Christian teaching about Judaism and the Jewish people is a central and indispensable obligation of theology in our time.\\" They then offer ten positions, with detailed explanations, \\"for the consideration of our fellow Christians. We urge all Christians to reflect on their faith in light of these statements.\\" 10 positions The ten positions, in brief, are: #God's covenant with the Jewish people endures forever. #Jesus of Nazareth lived and died as a faithful Jew, see also Historical Jesus. #Ancient rivalries must not define Christian-Jewish relations today. #Judaism is a living faith, enriched by many centuries of development. #The Bible both connects and separates Jews and Christians. #Affirming God's enduring covenant with the Jewish people has consequences for Christian understandings of salvation. #Christians should not target Jews for conversion. #Christian worship that teaches contempt for Judaism dishonors God. #We affirm the importance of the land of Israel for the life of the Jewish people. #Christians should work with Jews for the healing of the world. :The statement may or may not reflect the views of the scholars' various denominations.

It protects the user from an unknown person trying to access their data such as personal ID details or financial assets. Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) is a type, or subset, of multi-factor authentication. It is a method of confirming users' claimed identities by using a combination of two different factors: 1) something they know, 2) something they have, or 3) something they are. A third-party authenticator (TPA) app enables two-factor authentication, usually by showing a randomly-generated and constantly refreshing code which the user can use. Two-step verification or two-step authentication is a method of confirming a user's claimed identity by using something they know (password) and a second factor than something they have or something they are.  Authentication factors  Authentication takes place when someone tries to log into a computer resource (such as a network, device, or application). The resource requires the user to supply the identity by which the user is known to the resource, along with evidence of the authenticity of the user's claim to that identity. Simple authentication requires only one such piece of evidence (factor), typically a password. For additional security, the resource may require more than one factor—multi-factor authentication, or two-factor authentication in cases where exactly two pieces of evidence are to be supplied. The use of multiple authentication factors to prove one's identity is based on the premise that an unauthorized actor is unlikely to be able to supply the factors required for access. If, in an authentication attempt, at least one of the components is missing or supplied incorrectly, the user's identity is not established with sufficient certainty and access to the asset (e.g., a building, or data) being protected by multi-factor authentication then remains blocked. The authentication factors of a multi-factor authentication scheme may include: * Something you have: Some physical object in the possession of the user, such as a security token (USB stick), a bank card, a key, etc. * Something you know: Certain knowledge only known to the user, such as a password, PIN, TAN, etc. * Something you are: Some physical characteristic of the user (biometrics), such as a fingerprint, eye iris, voice, typing speed, pattern in key press intervals, etc. * Somewhere you are: Some connection to a specific computing network or using a GPS signal to identify the location. A good example of two-factor authentication is the withdrawing of money from an ATM; only the correct combination of a bank card (something the user possesses) and a PIN (something the user knows) allows the transaction to be carried out. Two other examples are to supplement a user- controlled password with a one-time password (OTP) or code generated or received by an authenticator (e.g. a security token or smartphone) that only the user possesses. A third-party authenticator app enables two-factor authentication in a different way, usually by showing a randomly-generated and constantly refreshing code which the user can use, rather than sending an SMS or using another method. A big benefit of these apps is that they usually continue to work even without an internet connection. Examples of third-party authenticator apps include Google Authenticator, Authy and Microsoft Authenticator; some password managers such as LastPass offer the service as well. An example of a second step in two-step verification or authentication is the user repeating back something that was sent to them through an out-of- band mechanism (such as a code sent over SMS), or a number generated by an app that is common to the user and the authentication system. =Knowledge factors= Knowledge factors are the most commonly used form of authentication. In this form, the user is required to prove knowledge of a secret in order to authenticate. A password is a secret word or string of characters that is used for user authentication. This is the most commonly used mechanism of authentication. Many multi-factor authentication techniques rely on password as one factor of authentication. Variations include both longer ones formed from multiple words (a passphrase) and the shorter, purely numeric, personal identification number (PIN) commonly used for ATM access. Traditionally, passwords are expected to be memorized. Many secret questions such as \\"Where were you born?\\" are poor examples of a knowledge factor because they may be known to a wide group of people, or be able to be researched. =Possession factors= Possession factors (\\"something the user and only the user has\\") have been used for authentication for centuries, in the form of a key to a lock. The basic principle is that the key embodies a secret which is shared between the lock and the key, and the same principle underlies possession factor authentication in computer systems. A security token is an example of a possession factor. Disconnected tokens RSA SecurID token, an example of a disconnected token generator Disconnected tokens have no connections to the client computer. They typically use a built-in screen to display the generated authentication data, which is manually typed in by the user. Connected tokens Connected tokens are devices that are physically connected to the computer to be used. Those devices transmit data automatically. There are a number of different types, including card readers, wireless tags and USB tokens. Software tokens A software token (a.k.a. soft token) is a type of two-factor authentication security device that may be used to authorize the use of computer services. Software tokens are stored on a general-purpose electronic device such as a desktop computer, laptop, PDA, or mobile phone and can be duplicated. (Contrast hardware tokens, where the credentials are stored on a dedicated hardware device and therefore cannot be duplicated, absent physical invasion of the device.) A soft token may not be a device the user interacts with. Typically an X.509v3 certificate is loaded onto the device and stored securely to serve this purpose. =Inherent factors= These are factors associated with the user, and are usually biometric methods, including fingerprint, face, voice, or iris recognition. Behavioral biometrics such as keystroke dynamics can also be used. =Location based factors= Increasingly, a fourth factor is coming into play involving the physical location of the user. While hard wired to the corporate network, a user could be allowed to login using only a pin code while off the network entering a code from a soft token as well could be required. This could be seen as an acceptable standard where access into the office is controlled. Systems for network admission control work in similar ways where your level of network access can be contingent on the specific network your device is connected to, such as wifi vs wired connectivity. This also allows a user to move between offices and dynamically receive the same level of network access in each. Use of mobile phones Many multi-factor authentication vendors offer mobile phone-based authentication. Some methods include push-based authentication, QR code based authentication, one-time password authentication (event-based and time-based), and SMS-based verification. SMS-based verification suffers from some security concerns. Phones can be cloned, apps can run on several phones and cell-phone maintenance personnel can read SMS texts. Not least, cell phones can be compromised in general, meaning the phone is no longer something only the user has. The major drawback of authentication including something the user possesses is that the user must carry around the physical token (the USB stick, the bank card, the key or similar), practically at all times. Loss and theft are risks. Many organizations forbid carrying USB and electronic devices in or out of premises owing to malware and data theft- risks, and most important machines do not have USB ports for the same reason. Physical tokens usually do not scale, typically requiring a new token for each new account and system. Procuring and subsequently replacing tokens of this kind involves costs. In addition, there are inherent conflicts and unavoidable trade-offs between usability and security. Two-step authentication involving mobile phones and smartphones provides an alternative to dedicated physical devices. To authenticate, people can use their personal access codes to the device (i.e. something that only the individual user knows) plus a one-time- valid, dynamic passcode, typically consisting of 4 to 6 digits. The passcode can be sent to their mobile device by SMS or can be generated by a one-time passcode-generator app. In both cases, the advantage of using a mobile phone is that there is no need for an additional dedicated token, as users tend to carry their mobile devices around at all times. , SMS is the most broadly- adopted multi-factor authentication method for consumer-facing accounts. Notwithstanding the popularity of SMS verification, security advocates have publicly criticized it and in July 2016 a United States NIST draft guideline proposed deprecating it as a form of authentication. A year later NIST reinstated SMS verification as a valid authentication channel in the finalized guideline. In 2016 and 2017 respectively, both Google and Apple started offering user two-step authentication with push notification as an alternative method. Security of mobile-delivered security tokens fully depends on the mobile operator's operational security and can be easily breached by wiretapping or SIM cloning by national security agencies. =Advantages= * No additional tokens are necessary because it uses mobile devices that are (usually) carried all the time. * As they are constantly changed, dynamically generated passcodes are safer to use than fixed (static) log-in information. * Depending on the solution, passcodes that have been used are automatically replaced in order to ensure that a valid code is always available, transmission/reception problems do not therefore prevent logins. =Disadvantages= * Users may still be susceptible to phishing attacks. An attacker can send a text message that links to a spoofed website that looks identical to the actual website. The attacker can then get the authentication code, user name and password. *A mobile phone is not always available—they can be lost, stolen, have a dead battery, or otherwise not work. *Mobile phone reception is not always available—large areas, particularly outside of towns, lack coverage. *SIM cloning gives hackers access to mobile phone connections. Social-engineering attacks against mobile-operator companies have resulted in the handing over of duplicate SIM cards to criminals. *Text messages to mobile phones using SMS are insecure and can be intercepted by IMSI-catchers. Thus third parties can steal and use the token. * Account recovery typically bypasses mobile-phone two-factor authentication. * Modern smartphones are used both for receiving email and SMS. So if the phone is lost or stolen and is not protected by a password or biometric, all accounts for which the email is the key can be hacked as the phone can receive the second factor. * Mobile carriers may charge the user for messaging fees. = Advances in mobile two- factor authentication = Advances in research of two-factor authentication for mobile devices consider different methods in which a second factor can be implemented while not posing a hindrance to the user. With the continued use and improvements in the accuracy of mobile hardware such as GPS, microphone, and gyro/acceleromoter, the ability to use them as a second factor of authentication is becoming more trustworthy. For example, by recording the ambient noise of the user's location from a mobile device and comparing it with the recording of the ambient noise from the computer in the same room in which the user is trying to authenticate, one is able to have an effective second factor of authentication. This also reduces the amount of time and effort needed to complete the process. Legislation and regulation The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard, requirement 8.3, requires the use of MFA for all remote network access that originates from outside the network to a Card Data Environment (CDE). Beginning with PCI-DSS version 3.2, the use of MFA is required for all administrative access to the CDE, even if the user is within a trusted network. =European Union= The second Payment Services Directive requires \\"strong customer authentication\\" on most electronic payments in the European Economic Area since September 14, 2019. =India= In India, the Reserve Bank of India mandated two-factor authentication for all online transactions made using a debit or credit card using either a password or a one-time password sent over SMS. This was temporarily withdrawn in 2016 for transactions up to ₹2,000 in the wake of the November 2016 banknote demonetisation. Vendors such as Uber have been pulled up by the central bank for allowing transactions to take place without two- factor authentication. =United States= Details for authentication for Federal Employees and Contractors in the USA are defined with the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12). Existing authentication methodologies involve the explained three types of basic \\"factors\\". Authentication methods that depend on more than one factor are more difficult to compromise than single-factor methods.\\"Frequently Asked Questions on FFIEC Guidance on Authentication in an Internet Banking Environment\\", August 15, 2006 IT regulatory standards for access to Federal Government systems require the use of multi-factor authentication to access sensitive IT resources, for example when logging on to network devices to perform administrative tasks and when accessing any computer using a privileged login. NIST Special Publication 800-63-3 discusses various forms of two-factor authentication and provides guidance on using them in business processes requiring different levels of assurance. In 2005, the United States' Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued guidance for financial institutions recommending financial institutions conduct risk-based assessments, evaluate customer awareness programs, and develop security measures to reliably authenticate customers remotely accessing online financial services, officially recommending the use of authentication methods that depend on more than one factor (specifically, what a user knows, has, and is) to determine the user's identity. In response to the publication, numerous authentication vendors began improperly promoting challenge-questions, secret images, and other knowledge-based methods as \\"multi-factor\\" authentication. Due to the resulting confusion and widespread adoption of such methods, on August 15, 2006, the FFIEC published supplemental guidelineswhich states that by definition, a \\"true\\" multi-factor authentication system must use distinct instances of the three factors of authentication it had defined, and not just use multiple instances of a single factor. Security According to proponents, multi- factor authentication could drastically reduce the incidence of online identity theft and other online fraud, because the victim's password would no longer be enough to give a thief permanent access to their information. However, many multi-factor authentication approaches remain vulnerable to phishing, man-in-the-browser, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Two-factor authentication in web applications are especially susceptible to phishing attacks, particularly in SMS and e-mails, and, as a response, many experts advise users not to share their verification codes with anyone, and many web application providers will place an advisory in an e-mail or SMS containing a code. Multi-factor authentication may be ineffective against modern threats, like ATM skimming, phishing, and malware. In May 2017 O2 Telefónica, a German mobile service provider, confirmed that cybercriminals had exploited SS7 vulnerabilities to bypass SMS based two-step authentication to do unauthorized withdrawals from users bank accounts. The criminals first infected the account holder's computers in an attempt to steal their bank account credentials and phone numbers. Then the attackers purchased access to a fake telecom provider and set-up a redirect for the victim's phone number to a handset controlled by them. Finally the attackers logged into victims' online bank accounts and requested for the money on the accounts to be withdrawn to accounts owned by the criminals. SMS passcodes were routed to phone numbers controlled by the attackers and the criminals transferred the money out. Implementation considerations Many multi-factor authentication products require users to deploy client software to make multi-factor authentication systems work. Some vendors have created separate installation packages for network login, Web access credentials and VPN connection credentials. For such products, there may be four or five different software packages to push down to the client PC in order to make use of the token or smart card. This translates to four or five packages on which version control has to be performed, and four or five packages to check for conflicts with business applications. If access can be operated using web pages, it is possible to limit the overheads outlined above to a single application. With other multi-factor authentication solutions, such as \\"virtual\\" tokens and some hardware token products, no software must be installed by end users. There are drawbacks to multi-factor authentication that are keeping many approaches from becoming widespread. Some users have difficulty keeping track of a hardware token or USB plug. Many users do not have the technical skills needed to install a client-side software certificate by themselves. Generally, multi-factor solutions require additional investment for implementation and costs for maintenance. Most hardware token-based systems are proprietary and some vendors charge an annual fee per user. Deployment of hardware tokens is logistically challenging. Hardware tokens may get damaged or lost and issuance of tokens in large industries such as banking or even within large enterprises needs to be managed. In addition to deployment costs, multi-factor authentication often carries significant additional support costs. A 2008 survey of over 120 U.S. credit unions by the Credit Union Journal reported on the support costs associated with two-factor authentication. In their report, software certificates and software toolbar approaches were reported to have the highest support costs. Research into deployments of multi-factor authentication schemes has shown that one of the elements that tends to impact the adoption of such systems is the line of business of the organization that deploys the multi-factor authentication system. Examples cited include the U.S. federal government, which employs an elaborate system of physical tokens (which themselves are backed by robust Public Key Infrastructure), as well as private banks, which tend to prefer multi-factor authentication schemes for their customers that involve more accessible, less expensive means of identity verification, such as an app installed onto a customer-owned smartphone. Despite the variations that exist among available systems that organizations may have to choose from, once a multi-factor authentication system is deployed within an organization, it tends to remain in place, as users invariably acclimate to the presence and use of the system and embrace it over time as a normalized element of their daily process of interaction with their relevant information system.  Controversies  In 2013, Kim Dotcom claimed to have invented two-factor authentication in a 2000 patent, and briefly threatened to sue all the major web services. However, the European Patent Office revoked his patent in light of an earlier 1998 US patent held by AT&T.; Examples Several popular web services employ multi-factor authentication, usually as an optional feature that is deactivated by default. Many Internet services (among them Google and Amazon AWS) use the open Time-based One-time Password algorithm (TOTP) to support two-step authentication.

Life McNamara was born in Peoria, Illinois. Upon graduation from Knox College, he pursued a Master of Arts degree at the University of Iowa. Following military service, McNamara earned his PhD in theater arts at Tulane University, where he became an academic colleague of Richard Schechner and an active contributor to the Tulane Drama Review (TDR). McNamara served as an associate editor of TDR while he taught theater history in the Drama Department at the University of Delaware, between 1966 and 1968. At Tulane, Schechner had crystallized a set of principles to describe environmental theater. McNamara illustrated many of them in his set design for Delaware academic colleague, William Bruehl's production of Faustus. Meanwhile, Schechner and Tulane Drama Review's editorial offices moved to NYU, where TDR was renamed The Drama Review. On relocation to NYU, Schechner played a leading role in forming The Performance Group, which, in the fall of 1968, began presenting \\"Dionysus in '69,\\" a contemporary revisitation of Euripides' The Bacchae as Environmental Theater. For \\"Dionysus in '69,\\" McNamara had designed a revolutionary set, which transformed the audience into citizens of the Greek city of Thebes and flowed the play's action over, through, and among them. In September 1968, just before the play opened, McNamara joined Schechner in teaching at NYU's Graduate Drama Department. McNamara was instrumental in the transformation of that NYU Department into the Performance Studies Department, which was officially launched in 1980. He founded the archives of Shubert Theatre in 1976 and served as director for 20 years. McNamara's research, writing, and curatorial pursuits resulted in numerous publications, exhibitions, productions, and archival collections. His life work spans the areas of theatre history, popular entertainments, public celebrations, and New York performance history. After retiring in 1996, McNamara remained professor emeritus of performance studies and director emeritus of the Shubert Archive. In later life, McNamara was diagnosed with sporadic cerebellar ataxia. He died in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, of pneumonia on 8 May 2009. Books * The New York Concert Saloon: the Devil's Own Nights.

He has been a Research Fellow at the Belfer Center International Security Program, Harvard University (2005–2006), and the United Nations Studies Program, Yale University (2003). He currently teaches at the University of Central Florida. Economic norms theory Economic norms theory links the economic conditions of clientelism, which prevail in many lower income societies, and contract- intensive economy, which prevails in many higher income societies, with divergent political interests and habits.Michael Mousseau, \\"The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace,\\" International Security, Vol. 33, No. 4 (Spring 2009), 52-86.Michael Mousseau, \\"Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror,\\" International Security, Vol. 27, No. 3 (Winter 2002-2003), 5-29. A contract-intensive economy is one where goods, services, and labor are highly commodified: most individuals obtain livable incomes, goods and services through interacting with strangers in a market where the state makes an active effort to ensure widespread availability of opportunities. In contract-poor societies, on the other hand, most individuals are economically dependent for their needs on social ties such as family, clans and religious/ethnic groups. The prevalent mode of transaction is reciprocal exchange where favors are returned (or withheld) in the light of prior interactions, usually among small in-groups. Thus, individuals have little need for reliably impartial states but have a strong interest in the welfare of their in-groups. Economic norms theory identifies a number of divergent interests that emerge from these divergent economic conditions. In contract-intensive societies individuals have an interest in all strangers having freedom of choice and being protected by reliably-impartial states – features that are essential for the proper functioning of an impersonal market. As a consequence, individuals in these societies prefer that their states enforce contracts reliably and impartially, protect individual rights, and make efforts to enhance the general welfare. Moreover, with the assumption of bounded rationality, individuals routinely dependent on trusting strangers in contract will develop the habits of trusting strangers and preferring universal rights, impartial law, and liberal democratic government. In contrast, individuals in contract-poor societies will develop the habits of abiding by the commands of group leaders, and distrusting those from out-groups. To the extent that control of the state can affect the welfare of groups, groups have an interest in seeking control of the state in order to distribute state rents in ways that favor themselves and help to maintain power. As a consequence, contract-poor societies often lack stable and liberal democracy, and are often plagued with extensive rent seeking, corruption, and weak rule of law. According to economic norms theory, the people in contract-rich nations enjoy a permanent and positive peace. As long as their states accede to popular demands and remain reliably impartial, individuals in nations with contract intensive economies have an interest in everyone’s rights and material welfare, within and outside the nation. Consequently, contract-intensive nations not only avoid war with each other but engage in intense levels of mutual cooperation specifically aimed at promoting each other's material welfare. Leaders of nations with contract-poor economies, in contrast, pursue the interests of their dominant groups and have no interest in the security or welfare of members of out-groups, whether they are internal or external to the nation. A policy implication of the economic norms theory is that contract-intensive democracies should enact policies that will promote full employment across the globe. If the vast majority of individuals in contract-poor societies could find jobs on the market they would opt out of their dependence on group leaders. They would then have interests in reliably impartial government and in the rights and welfare of strangers, making peace within and between all nations possible.

Background The use of coal gas for illumination and heating had expanded since its invention in the early 18th century by William Murdoch, a Scottish engineer. By the middle of the nineteenth century there were nearly one thousand gas companies within Great Britain with thirteen in London. Increasing competition had led to falling dividends and by the 1850s the industry welcomed change. The act The Metropolitan Gas Act 1860 ended the severe competition and encroachment on rival companies' gas supply areas. It permitted companies to arrange for the monopoly lighting of allotted districts. The act included the first attempt to produce a standard measure for energy supply when it defined the term candle power. Outcome The monopoly status of the gas companies led to overcharging and abuse resulting in a public outcry. A select committee was formed to decide on the best response, and as a result the City of London Gas Act 1868 (quickly extended to cover the entire metropolitan area) tried to regularise this by forcing the remaining gas companies to open their accounts to public view.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, she was the second child of Henry and Julia Rainsford and from an early age aspired to a career on the stage, beginning violin and dance lessons at age 8. Her sister Doris, 4 years her senior, was devoted to Billy and was her nearly constant companion throughout her life. Billy was a member of New York's famous Kiddie Klub and performed with such stars as Paulette Goddard, Gene Raymond, and Arlin Riggin, the former Olympic champion. She honed her dance techniques in Rutherford High School Productions, and by 1922, at the age of 17, she had joined Pat Rooney's \\"Rings of Smoke\\" Vaudeville act portraying the \\"French girl\\" on a cross-country tour. The tour gave her valuable Vaudeville experience, which led her to the nascent film industry and the D.W. Griffith Company in Mamaroneck, New York. She landed the role of the dancing Indian Princess in Griffith's film America (1924), and appeared in Sally of the Sawdust (1925). In addition, she worked with Griffith plotting scenes for his leading actress Carol Dempster. When the Griffith Studio closed, Billy continued her silent film career at other New York studios including: the Spitz, Pathe, Famous Players-Lasky, and Tech Art starring with Dexter McReynolds, Charley Bowers, Fatty Lehman, and Duncan Renaldo. She also did some modeling during this period, most notably for the artist Bradshaw Crandell, who painted several magazine and calendar covers of Billy, as well as, the pastel portrait in the collection. When the film industry moved to the west coast, Billy remained in New York with her mother and her sister and began appearing in nightclub acts in many of New York's famous nightclubs including Don Dickerman's, Pirate's Den, and Country Fair Clubs in Greenwich Village. Following a brief marriage and the birth of her son Richard Rainsford, she performed on the cruise ship circuit to Havana. Wanting to spend more time with her only child, Billy began a profitable business of writing song lyrics for notable song writers such as Arthur Gutman, Gilbert Wall, Ray Dallas, and performers such as Spivy LeVoe, Florence Herbert, Harriet Hutchins, Beth Challis, and Irène Bordoni. Later in life, Billy went on to own a wholesale antiques shop in upstate New York, which she ran with her son and her sister. Billy and Doris then followed Richard's academic career and eventually ended up in Ohio where Billy painted miniature landscapes and wrote her unpublished autobiography 'I Was There Charlie'.

She is long and across the widest part of the deck. Like all Thames barges, she is flat-bottomed and has leeboards instead of a keel. She spent some of her life ketch-rigged and some of it spritsail- rigged. She is now permanently spritsail rigged, and has a mainmast and topmast that, together, are about high, and a mizzen mast. Thalatta has had two periods with an auxiliary engine and two without. She carried cargo for sixty years and was then converted for use as a sail training ship in 1966. She was completely rebuilt between 2006 and 2012 at St Osyth with assistance from lottery funds. History Thalatta was built by McLearon's shipyard in Harwich. She was bought from McLearon's by Fred Horlock of Mistley, who gave her a spritsail rig suitable for sailing in the smooth waters of the Thames estuary. She was registered on 6 February 1906 and her first skipper was James Alliston of Mistley.Kemp, John: A Fair Wind For London. Sailtrust Ltd, 1983. Thalatta's first freight was from London to Lowestoft, and from there they went to Hull and then back to Mistley. On 24 March, they sailed to Ipswich to load beans for Nieuwpoort in Belgium and there they loaded a cargo for Antwerp. During that first year of trading, Thalatta visited Hull again and also Dunkirk and Rotterdam. The spritsail rig isn't a good rig for the rough waters of the North Sea, and at some point, early in her life, Thalatta was re-rigged as a ketch, with a boom and gaff mainsail Between 1908 and 1914 the barge made frequent passages to the north of England, to Newcastle and Sunderland, and west to Appledore in North Devon, as well as Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford in Ireland with malt from Mistley and Ipswich. She also visited many ports on the European mainland. On 10 November 1908, she was caught in a severe storm between Sunderland and the Thames and, three days later, was towed into Lowestoft with a broken main gaff and a split sail. A couple of months later, on 15 January 1909, under way in the Thames's Blackwall reach, and loaded with maize, Thalatta was in collision with a steamer, which did considerable damage to her starboard side. Such a collision was not an unusual occurrence in the Thames at that time. In 1915, the first world war brought a change in Thalattas use and she was put to work as a lighter in the Thames for a year. The following year, she ran between Shoreham and Dieppe, loaded with pig iron to feed the French war machine. The Thalatta being rebuilt In 1917 the barge was bought by the Wynnfield Shipping Company of Grimsby, who installed a two-cycle vertical oil engine, built by Plenty & Sons of Newbury. She was used as a supply vessel to the Humber boom defences skippered by Percy Richmond (who had previously been mate). At the end of the war, Herbert John Body of Southend took over as skipper and Thalatta had a regular run into war- torn Flanders with materials for postwar rebuilding. Between 1919 and 1921 she also went to Paris, Antwerp, Brussels, and Rotterdam. After that, she carried cement to Torquay, china clay from Fowey to Greenhithe, and granite chippings from the Channel Islands. Then in 1923, she was sold to Captain Body and, for reasons now long forgotten, her engine was taken out. She was converted back to a spritsail rig and continued carrying cargoes between the north of England and the Channel, as well as to mainland Europe. After ten years, Body sold her to maltsters R & W Paul of Ipswich and her cargoes then were malt and occasionally flour to London, barley or wheat to Ipswich, animal feed to Colchester and Faversham, and occasional runs across the North Sea. Her skipper was Bob Ruffles and, after him, there were Lucas, Wells, and Webb. Pauls looked after the barge well and she was found to be unusually sound and well-preserved when her last Board of Trade loadline inspection was carried out in 1964. These timbers are some of Thalattas original floors. After the second world war, her skipper, Joe Lucas, sailed her to Lowestoft where she was again fitted with an auxiliary engine - a war surplus Ruston and Hornsby marine diesel - at Richards' yard. In 1966 Thalatta was sold to John Kemp of Maldon who converted her for use as a school ship. She was then re-rigged, using some items from another damaged barge 'Memory'.Nick Ardley She was contracted to take school children from the London Borough of Redbridge sailing for five day trips between April and October. The barge was later taken over by the East Coast Sail Trust and continued to work as a schoolship skippered by John Kemp with Jane Benham as the mate. John Kemp died at the wheel in September 1987, near Mersea Island in the Blackwater estuary. In 2005, the Trust had to repair the hull, as the hull and structure were in danger of rotting away. In 2006, the East Coast Sail Trust received a grant of £527,500 from the Heritage Lottery Fund for the restoration of Thalatta. In March, skipper Gary Diddams and mate Roger Davies sailed to the St Osyth boatyard for refurbishment. The original intention was to just replace the outer planking and the worst of the frames, but it became apparent that most of the frames were rotted beyond repair and only the floors (the bottom sections of the frame) and the relatively new transom were fit to be retained. It was decided that the old barge should be rebuilt and East Coast Sail Trust began to raise funds to carry out this very expensive job. Using Heritage funding, they completed the repairs in 2009. Then in August 2011, they re- launched the barge. The rebuilding process was completed in 2012 and Thalatta was able to resume her work as a sail training ship that year. Name The name Thalatta is the anglicized version of the Greek word θάλαττα, meaning \\"the sea\\". A yacht named Thalassa was built in Cowes in the same year as the Thalatta, 1906. Thalassa (θάλασσα) is an alternative form of the same Greek word. A possible explanation of this apparent case of synchronicity is the fact that Mrs Baillie Reynolds published a highly popular novel named Thalassa in the same year.Rood, Tim: The Sea! The Sea! The Shout of the Ten Thousand in the Modern Imagination. Duckworth, 2004, p. 106. It seems unlikely that the conjunction of these three events is pure chance, although clear evidence of a link between them remains to be found.

The barge's former cargo space was converted into communal living quarters where young people sleep in hammocks and keep their belongings in big wooden sea chests.East Coast Sail Trust: Five days in another world ... (brochure). Over forty years, thousands of kids have benefited from their experience of living and working as crew aboard the barge. During the five-day voyages, the young people assist with the working of the ship, taking turns with cooking and cleaning, as well as winding up the anchor, setting the heavy red sails, and taking a turn at the wheel. The ship carries two large ship's boats, each able to carry eight passengers. These can be rowed or propelled by outboard motors and are used to explore coastal inlets and creeks which are too shallow for the barge to navigate. Thalattas educational cruises offer the opportunity for a varied programme of environmental studies and give a glimpse into the vanished age of working timber sailing ships. They combine adventure with formal learning, covering such topics as estuary ecology, pollution, fisheries, waterside communities, sea defences, and rescue services.

Life He was a younger son of Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland, by Elizabeth Cary née Tanfield. At an early age he was sent to France, to be brought up a Catholic. After staying there three years he went to Italy, where he resided for twelve years. For some time he received a small pension from Queen Henrietta Maria, and subsequently he was provided for by Pope Urban VIII: an abbey and a priory in commendam, with other benefices. In Rome he met both John Milton and John Evelyn.:s:Cary, Patrick (DNB00) On 18 March 1650 Cary wrote from Brussels to Sir Edward Hyde in distress. He was unwilling to take orders, but if Sir Edward could not help him soon he must enter a convent. Cary became a Benedictine at Douai, but left within a year. He then came to England. After an aimless period, and giving up his Catholic faith, he trained for the law, being admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1652. He died in Ireland in 1657. Works Walter Scott edited, from a manuscript in the author's autograph, Trivial Poems and Triolets. Written in obedience to Mrs. Tomkin's commands. By Patrick Carey, 20 Aug 1651, London, 1820. The first part consists of Trivial Ballads, and the second part, dated from Warnefurd. 1661, of Triolets, hymns original and translated, and other religious poems. Scott was not aware of Cary's background when he edited the poems; he made the identification subsequently, as appears from a note in Woodstock. Some poems had been previously published under the title of Poems from a manuscript written in the time of Oliver Cromwell, London, 1771. This manuscript was in the possession of the Rev. Pierrepoint Cromp. This first edition contains nine, and the second thirty-seven poems. The Poems of Patrick Cary, edited by Veronica Delany, was published in 1978. In the Brotherton Collection, University of Leeds, is an autograph manuscript of \\"Ballades dedicated to the Lady Victoria Uvedale\\" (1652/53).

A clockwork motor in the base pumps a heavy vegetable oil from the vase like reservoir to the burner at the top.The pump mechanism used to pump lamp oil to the burner in the Carcel lamp of 1800. The pump was immersed in the lamp oil reservoir. The piston was powered by a clockwork motor, which is not shown. The Carcel lamp was an efficient lighting device used in the nineteenth century for domestic purposes and in France as the standard measure for illumination. The lamp was invented by the French watchmaker Bernard Guillaume Carcel (1750–1818) to overcome the disadvantages of the Argand-type lamps then in use. The vegetable - mostly colza - oils then available were thick and would not travel far up a wick. The Argand lamps used a gravity feed which meant that the oil reservoir was located above the burner, casting a shadow and making the lamp top heavy. Carcel designed a lamp with the oil reservoir under the burner, in the body of the lamp. To keep the oil moving up to the burner, Carcel housed a clockwork mechanism in the lamp base that drove a small pump submerged in the oil tank. The winding key was located at the bottom of the lamp base. Another innovative feature was that fuel was pumped into the wick tubes at a greater volume than was necessary for burning so that it overflowed the top of the wicks, thus cooling the burner. The advantages Carcel claimed for his lamp in his 1800 patent in Paris were that the movement operated unattended, the oil could be used to the last drop, the lamp would stay lit for sixteen hours continuously without refilling, and it provided illumination for several persons at the same time with a single burner. They were complex devices however, and were expensive and prone to problems in the mechanism. They were most popular in wealthier European cities. Their unpopularity was partially due to the necessity of having to return them to the (mostly European) manufacturers for repair. In 1829 the simpler Moderator lamp was invented, which dispensed with clockwork and used only a weighted piston to move the oil, and this eventually superseded them. The French physical standard Carcel lamp consisted of a cylindrical Argand burner, and gave the standard brightness when 42 grams of colza oil were consumed per hour. The supply and draught were regulated by clockwork.\\"Photometry\\", 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica See also * List of obsolete units of measurement References Category:Oil lamp Category:Lighthouse fixtures Category:Photometry Category:Units of luminous intensity Category:Obsolete units of measurement ","title":"Carcel lamp"},{"id":"22772618","text":"Guillaume Bautru (1657) Guillaume Bautru, comte de Serrant (1588, Angers - 7 March 1665, Paris) was a French satirical poet, court favourite and a protégé and diplomatic agent of cardinal Richelieu.

Patriarchal statement An Orthodox Christian attitude to the Jewish people is seen in an encyclical of 1568 written by Ecumenical Patriarch Metrophanes III (1520-1580) to the Greek Orthodox in Crete (1568) following reports that Jews were being mistreated. The Patriarch states: \\"Injustice ... regardless to whomever acted upon or performed against, is still injustice. The unjust person is never relieved of the responsibility of these acts under the pretext that the injustice is done against a heterodox and not to a believer. As our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospels said do not oppress or accuse anyone falsely; do not make any distinction or give room to the believers to injure those of another belief.\\" Views on salvation and pluralism The traditional Jewish view is that non-Jews may receive God's saving grace (see Noahides), and this view is reciprocated in Orthodox Christianity. Writing for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, Rev. Protopresbyter George C. Papademetriou has written a summary of classical Christian and Eastern Orthodox Christian views on the subject of the salvation of non-Christians, entitled An Orthodox Christian View of Non-Christian Religions. In 1981, Professor John N. Karmiris, University of Athens, based on his studies of the Church Fathers, concluded that the salvation of non- Christians, non-Orthodox and heretics depends on the all-good, all-wise and all-powerful God, who acts in the Church but also through other \\"ways.\\"http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8089 God's saving grace is also channeled outside the Church. It cannot be assumed that salvation is denied non-Christians living in true piety and according to natural law by the God who \\"is love\\" (1 John 4:8), In his justice and mercy God will judge them worthy even though they are outside the true Church. This position is shared by many Orthodox who agree that God's salvation extends to all who live according to His \\"image\\" and \\"participate in the Logos.\\" The Holy Spirit acted through the prophets of the Old Testament and in the nations. Salvation is also open outside the Church. Some compare the Church to Noah's Ark. It is not impossible for someone to \\"survive the flood\\" of sin by clinging to whatever driftwood is around or by trying to cobble together a raft from bits and pieces of whatever floats, but the Ark is a far safer choice to make. Likewise, the heterodox and even non-Christians might be saved simply through God's own choice, made for His own reasons, but it is far safer for any individual person to turn to the Orthodox Church. Thus, it behooves Orthodox Christians to exhort others to take this safer path. Likewise, the Orthodox remember that Christ mentions one, and only one thing that unfailingly leads to perdition—blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. No other path is explicitly and universally excluded by Christ's words. As is common in many other faiths, the question of salvation for those outside of Orthodox Christianity is understandably secondary to what the Church expects of its own adherents. As St. Theophan the Recluse put the matter: \\"You ask, will the heterodox be saved... Why do you worry about them? They have a Saviour Who desires the salvation of every human being. He will take care of them. You and I should not be burdened with such a concern. Study yourself and your own sins... I will tell you one thing, however: should you, being Orthodox and possessing the Truth in its fullness, betray Orthodoxy, and enter a different faith, you will lose your soul forever.\\" Fifth Academic Meeting The Fifth Academic Meeting between Judaism And Orthodox Christianity was held in Thessaloniki, Greece, on May 27–29, 2003. The meeting was organized by Metropolitan Emmanuel of France, who heads the Office of International and Intercultural Affairs to the Liaison Office of the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the European Union, Brussels, in cooperation with the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations, New York, Co-Chaired by Rabbi Israel Singer who is also Chairman of the World Jewish Congress, and Rabbi Joel Meyers who is also the Executive Vice President of the Rabbinical Assembly. In his opening remarks, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew denounced religious fanaticism and rejected attempts by any faith to denigrate others. Principles for relations The following principles were adopted at the meeting: * Judaism and Christianity while hearkening to common sources inviolably maintain their internal individuality and particularity. * The purpose of our dialogue is to remove prejudice and to promote a spirit of mutual understanding and constructive cooperation in order to confront common problems. * Specific proposals will be developed to educate the faithful of both religions to promote healthy relationships based on mutual respect and understanding to confront bigotry and fanaticism. * Being conscious of the crises of ethical and spiritual values in the contemporary world, we will endeavor to identify historical models of peaceful coexistence, which can be applied to minority Jewish and Orthodox communities in the Diaspora. * We will draw from our spiritual sources to develop programs to promote and enhance our common values such as peace, social justice and human rights, specifically addressing the concerns of religious minorities. Participants agreed to establish a permanent coordinating committee to maintain and foster continuing relationships. The Committee would jointly monitor principles enunciated at the meeting and would further enhance the dialogue and foster understanding between the respective religious communities.

Tiwaris are the main caste which inhabit the placeand and Some dubey's(five families) lives there. Besides, there are some 300 chamar (scheduled Caste) who are considered low caste people. Some Kotwar (three families) are too living in the village. Economy Agriculture is main profession of the village. Wheat, Arahar, chana, masoor, rice, etc. are some major crops. Soybean is a recent crop. However, after the liberalization there has been tremendous changes and people have started various other occupations and one of them is mining of stones for construction purposes, crashers of stones have come up at nearby places and are owned by people of the village. Very few people in the village stay - mostly women. Youngsters are either working in the Satna city or moved out to work in major metros of India such as Delhi, Mumbai, Indore, etc. People at the place prefer to do various kinds of small and big jobs, and for that they send their wards to study in city schools. Though the village has a high school, most children from upper caste Brahmin families either stay in Satna and study in public school or commute to schools from the village. Newly built roads in the village connect it with Satna. People in Khamhariya own bikes and cars which are being used as a major mode of transportation. Whereas Steel Authority of India Limited was a leading employer some decades ago, JP Cement has started its new plant at the place. Though the company cannot hire too many people yet it will provide indirect employment to villagers. A new hope is coming to stir up the life of people.

The abbess of Fontevraud Abbey, she was an influential figure in the 17th century French intellectual community. She was the daughter of Gabriel de Rochechouart, duc de Mortemart, and thus sister to Madame de Montespan. Life Gabrielle de Rochechouart was endowed with great beauty. In her childhood, she devoted herself to studying philosophy and languages, living and dead. Upon submitting to Maria Theresa of Spain, it was an astonishment to the new queen, unaccustomed as she was to hear a young person from the court speak languages other than French with ease. Introduced to various schools, who shared opinions, she turned to theology and doctrine of the Holy Fathers and Councils. With all these gifts, she was nevertheless of great simplicity. The world offered her all the seductions: she preferred to devote herself to God and buried deep in a retreat. She took the veil in the monastery of Saint-Evroult-Notre-Dame-du-Bois in 1664, then in Poissy.  Queen of Abbesses  Gabrielle de Rochechouart Mortemart fled from worldly status. But Louis XIV, who understood how to distinguish merit, appointed her, on 16 August 1670, Superior General of the Fontevraud Abbey, where she led the monks along with the nuns. Without neglecting the duties of her office, she did not forget his favourite studies and turned Fontevraud into an intellectual and cultural centre. She translated the first three books of The Iliad of Homer, and with Racine, Plato's Symposium. Endowed with great exactness of mind, she met the best writers of the day, asking for their opinions and advice. Always humble, she received them with love, and they retired happy, even honoured to have been admitted to her. Under her administration, the order was thriving. Authority over the abbey, which was the mother-house of 50 dependent priories, earned her the title of queen of Abbesses, as reported by Saint-Simon, that > his spirit surpassed that of her sisters, and she joined them with a > knowledge strong and extensive. Victor Cousin says: > She had the spirit of Mortemart, and something of the beauty of her sisters, > with the most noble traits and an air of majesty and mildness. Louis XIV, with whom she corresponded regularly, tried to appoint her to the court, but she refused, preferring to remain in Fontevraud. After her disgrace, Madame de Montespan had frequent stays in the abbey of her sister, whom she loved. Gabrielle de Rochechouart Mortemart died on 15 August 1704, leaving several pamphlets of various kinds. On hearing the news, Louis XIV pronounced during his dinner a thought for the great abbess. > He had preserved, wrote Saint-Simon, esteem and friendship which neither the > expulsion of Madame de Montespan, or extreme for Madame de Maintenon could > not dull. She was replaced as head of the abbey by her niece, Louise-Françoise, de Mortemart.

The Chamber watches over proper performance of tax advisory services, regulates activities of tax advisers, creates preconditions for improvement of their qualification, offers its members a wide range of various services, protects and promotes their rightful interests and helps to form a suitable environment for tax advisers' work. Constitution The Chamber is an independent professional organization of tax advisers. Its existence is given by the Tax Advisory Services and the Chamber of Tax Advisers of the Czech Republic Act no. 523/1992 Coll., which came into effect on 1 December 1992. This act regulates both the position and activities of tax advisers and the activity of the Chamber itself. The Tax Advisory Services Act guarantees demanded professional standards of the profession, regulates the position of the Chamber of Tax Advisers, rights and duties of tax advisers and defines tax advisory services themselves as provision of legal help and financial-economic advice concerning taxes, tax payments, duties and other payments as well as concerning things associated directly with taxes. Pursuant to this act, only those individuals who are listed on the list of the Chamber of Tax Advisers of the Czech Republic can be considered as tax advisers. Tax advisers are compulsory members of the Chamber by law. The autonomous character of the Chamber is an important feature which ensures the independence of the Chamber and at the same time it is a precondition for its high professional level. Bodies of the Chamber *General Assembly *Presidium *Supervisory Committee *Disciplinary Committee *Examination Board Performance of tax advisory services The regulation of performance of tax advisory services has its basis in the law and subsequently in the Statutes of the Chamber. Pursuant to the Tax Advisory Services Act, only those individuals who are listed on the list of the Chamber of Tax Advisers of the Czech Republic can be considered as tax advisers. Tax adviser is entitled and obliged to protect rights and rightful interests of his/her client. He/she is obliged to act honestly and conscientiously, to use all legal means consistently and to apply everything he/she considers to be beneficial in accordance with his/her own conscience and client's order. Tax advisory services are based on independence, high professional qualification and tax advisers guarantee extensive professional confidentiality and full responsibility for potential harm to their clients. An important legislative change in the field of tax advisory services was brought by the amendment of Tax Advisory Services and the Chamber of Tax Advisers Act no. 523/1992 Coll., with effect from the 1st of July 2008. This amendment regulates the position of legal entities entitled to perform tax advisory services. The amendment responds to the change of the Administration of Taxes Act from 2007, by which the legislative term “tax adviser” has involved also legal entities entitled to provide tax advisory services, and thus has enabled these legal entities to represent clients in tax procedures to the same extent to which tax advisers can do that. These legal entities are not members of the Chamber. The Chamber records them on a special list and, as providers of tax advisory services, these legal entities must observe the Act no. 523/1992 Coll.

Life A peripatetic childhood = The son of Jules de Rochechouart and Elisabeth-Armide Durey de Morsan, Louis-Victor-Léon de Rochechouart was born in Paris on 14 September 1788, only a few months before the outbreak of the French Revolution. A younger brother and thus likely destined for a career in the church, he had to flee Paris in 1794 (aged 6) due to his mother's activities in attempting to arrange for the escape of queen Marie-Antoinette. Pursued by gendarmes come to arrest her, she, Louis-Victor-Léon and his brother Louis managed to escape, though his 10-year-old sister Cornélie was not so lucky - chased by the authorities, and on her own, she died of exhaustion after 3 days wandering Paris. Forced to leave France, the countess of Rochechouart left her two young sons in a house in Caen owned by a couple who exploited the situation. Housed in terrible conditions and deprived of food, the two brothers became the couple's servants. After a year they were found by a relative and freed from service. They reached Fribourg in Switzerland in 1796, where they hoped their still-exiled mother would join them but she was prevented from doing so. Thus the two brothers were generously housed by a citizen of that town until revolutionary French troops entered it in 1798 and forced them to flee once more. They finally caught up with their mother in Antwerp, before moving on with her to Rotterdam, London and Hamburg. Her implication in plots to restore the monarchy lost her her fortune, brought her many political problems and leave several refuge countries. Without a sou, she and her two children finally took refuge in Germany, where they were forced to make and sell bags to survive. He later wrote of this period \\"This kind of life gave me good sad reflections. Misery is a terrible thing. Nobody can get a full idea of it who has not suffered it himself. This evil can happen to anyone, imprison anyone.\\" Aged 11, Louis- Victor-Léon de Rochechouart thus decided to embark for Hamburg to join the émigré regiment commanded by his uncle the duke of Mortemart and intended for Portugal. After many adventures, leading him through the Netherlands, England and Spain, he finally arrived in Lisbon in 1800. = In the émigré army = The comte de Rochechouart, during his service in the Russian Army Aged 12, Louis-Victor-Léon de Rochechouart joined the régiment de Mortemart, one of the émigré regiments raised after the rout of Condé's army in 1799. Little by little these regiments' original aim of freeing France from the Revolution became subordinated to overall British strategy. The régiment de Mortemart was sent to Portugal to support an operation by the Portuguese army on its frontiers, faced with a French advance. In 1801 Louis-Victor-Léon fought in the Alemtejo campaign during the War of the Oranges. After 15 days in close contact near Abrantès, the Portuguese army (with the regiment attached) on one side and the Franco-Spanish army on the other both retired without a single shot being fired. Peace was signed in Madrid under the aegis of Lucien Bonaparte. Having entered the regiment as an ensign, the comte de Rochechouart was a sous-lieutenant by the time the regiment was dissolved in 1802. Aged 14, he returned to Paris, where for 2 years he spent his fortune on the pleasures in the capital. In 1804 he tried to get to Russia, where he had traced his mother and brother. With no money, he travelled in fantastical fashion, financing his trip in part by wins at the Milan casino. He was miraculously reunited with a relation in Vienna, who helped him get to Poland, where he found his mother in 1805. From there they traveled to the Crimea, where the countess of Rochechouart and her son were living. The reunions were short- lived, however - she died a few weeks later. Louis-Victor-Léon was thus taken in by his uncle the duke of Richelieu, governor of Odessa, over time becoming his adoptive son. = In the Tsar's service = Louis-Victor-Léon de Rochechouart entered the Russian army at the rank of sous-lieutenant and became aide de camp to the duke of Richelieu. He rose through the ranks, serving as a lieutenant in the imperial guard, then aide de camp de l'empereur Alexander I of Russia. From 1805 to 1812, he participated in the conquest of Bessarabia and Circassia, fought in Caucasia and Chechnya. When France invaded Russia in 1812, Rochechouart was mobilised in general Tormassov's army. He participated in the capture of Minsk, then at Berezina, where he witnessed the tragic crossing of the river by the French army. He summed up the Russian campaign thus: The Russian Army entering Paris Made colonel then major- general, he fought in the subsequent German campaign at the battles of Lützen, Dresden, Kulm and Leipzig. In September that year he was sent on a mission to convince Napoleon's former Marshal, and Swedish Crown Prince Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, later King Charles XIV John of Sweden, to move his Army of the North across the Elbe to engage Napoleon's forces.Sir Dunbar Plunket Barton, \\"Bernadotte: Prince and King\\" pp. 96-101. At the start of 1814 he crossed the Rhine with the Russian army, setting foot in France for the first time in 10 years. He came into contact with the future Louis XVIII and Charles X and participated in the creation of a royalist party. His brother Louis, with whom he had shared many hardships, was killed at Brienne and so he became head of the House of Rochechouart. Louis-Victor-Léon fought in the Six Days Campaign and the battles of Arcis-sur-Aube, La Fère-Champenoise and Paris. Made commander of Paris, he captured the Hotel de Ville on 31 March. Face with rumours of a counter-attack by Napoleon, he organised the city's defences and then restored order in Paris, facing down the troubles provoked by the occupying troops by deploying mixed bodies of men consisting of both Russian and National Guard troops. On Louis XVIII's arrival on 20 April Rochechouart took leave of the Russian army to offer Louis his services. =Military governor of Paris= Louis-Victor-Léon de Rochechouart was made maréchal de camp by Louis XVIII, incorporated into the company of black musketeers and on 29 August made a knight of the Ordre de Saint-Louis. He accompanied the king to Ghent during the Hundred Days and on their return on the Second Restoration he rose to chef d'État-major to the minister of war, to duc de Feltre, then maréchal de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr, and then to the duc de Feltre when Rochechouart's adoptive father the duke of Richelieu was made prime minister. On 16 October 1815 Rochechouart was made military governor of Paris, occupying the post until 1821. He was notable for his involvement in two major events of the Restoration. First, in November 1815, he took support to general Daumesnil, besieged at Fort de Vincennes by occupying Prussian troops. Impressed on their meeting by his courage and determination, Rochechouart intervened at the ministry in Daumesnil's favour. As commander of Paris, Rochechouart was entrusted with a much more dolorous task, that is, organising the execution of marshal Ney, a decision of which he disapproved, writing later > Not only was I forced to assist in his death, my duties obliged me to > execute the decree of the Court of Peers as regarded this unjust victim of > our reactionary policies. He put a piémontais officer at the head of the execution squad, to avoid giving this duty to a French soldier. General Rochechouart also accompanied Ney's final hours and wrote a moving account of them in his memoirs, concluding \\"Here is a great lesson in learning well how to die\\". In 1821, he was nominated Lord of the Royal bedchamber and commandeur of the Légion d'honneur. A few days after his 13 December 1821 wedding, he was put out of his job. In 1826, Louis-Victor-Léon de Rochechouart bought the château de Jumilhac and Château de Rochechouart. In 1830, he participated in the Algerian expedition. In 1855, Napoleon III of France made general Rochechouart mayor of Jumilhac. Personal life Château de Jumilhac In 1821, he married Elisabeth Ouvrard, daughter of the banker and businessman Gabriel-Julien Ouvrard, with an immense fortune. The lavish ceremony occurred on 13 December 1821 occurred in the presence of the Prime Minister, the Duke of Richelieu, Louis XVIII, and the future Charles X and Louis-Philippe I. They had four children: * Madeleine-Elisabeth-Gabrielle de Rochechouart (1822–1889), who became the marquise de la Garde. * Valentine de Rochechouart (1825–1907), who became the comtesse de Montalembert. * Aimery de Rochechouart (1828–1897) * Louis-Jules de Rochechouart (1830–1880) Rochechouart died in Jumilhac-le-Grand in 1858.

AsiaIndia= India has been a place of fertile religious endeavour since the latter part of the Vedic period. Jainism and Buddhism, which were part of the sramana movement have been from their inception religions motivated by compassion for all creatures as well as believers in the inherent rationality and reasonableness of true religion. They have thus sought and advocated rational debate concerning matters of truth. India is, in fact, as far as we can tell the home of the first written statement of religious pluralism, tolerance and interfaith dialogue. The Rock Edict XII by the Emperor Ashoka states the following: :: Religious tolerance was promoted to varying degrees during the course of several Muslim settlements (Delhi Sultanate 1276-1526 AD and the Mughal Empire 1526–1857 AD). In the 8th century, Zoroastrianism was established in India as Zoroastrians fled from Persia to India in large numbers, where they were given refuge. The colonial phase ushered in by the British lasted until 1947 and furthered conversions to Christianity among low caste Hindus. In 1948 as many as 20,000 Jews Bene Jews and Cochin Jews lived in India, though most of them have since emigrated to Israel. Although in Japan Buddhism and Shinto have more or less co-existed for centuries, the arrival of Christianity through Francis Xavier led to widespread persecution of Christians and the eventual exclusion of Christianity for hundreds of years until the Meiji era, as the rulers of Japan saw it as a threat. Christians and Buddhists were also persecuted under State Shinto. =Mongol Empire= Mongols were highly tolerant of most religions during the early Mongol Empire, and typically sponsored several at the same time. To avoid strife, Genghis Khan set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom, though he himself was a shamanist. Under his administration, all religious leaders were exempt from taxation, and from public service. Mongol emperors were known for organizing competitions of religious debates among clerics, and these would draw large audiences. Islamic world Mehmed II's ahidnâme to the Catholic monks of the recently conquered Bosnia issued in 1463, granting them full religious freedom and protection. Religious pluralism existed in medieval Islamic law and Islamic ethics, as the religious laws and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as exemplified in the Caliphate, Al-Andalus, Ottoman Empire and Indian subcontinent. In medieval Islamic societies, the qadi (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily choose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the dhimmi communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who would have their own Halakha courts. Islamic empires allowed non-believers to have their own laws and courts in exchange for a Jizya poll tax. Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order. Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that was usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork, as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the Zoroastrian practice of incestuous \\"self-marriage\\" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim (1292-1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion. EuropeAntiquity= The polytheistic Roman empire saw the traditional Roman religion as one fundamentals of the Roman republic. They saw Roman virtues as an important link in their multi-ethnic empire. Being polytheistic, Romans did not mind if conquered nations went on worshiping their traditional gods, as long as they also presented token offerings to the Roman gods. In many cases this compromise was easily reached by identifying the traditional gods with similar Roman gods. Failure to offer up this token worship was seen as disloyal to Rome, and an act of political rebellion against the Emperor. There was, though, a problem with people whose religion excluded the veneration of other gods - especially the Jews and the Christians. The Romans tended to view this as rebellion, and so it resulted in many conflicts arising from often unintended offenses, like putting a statue of an emperor in a prominent place in Jerusalem which resulted in a public revolt. Similarly difficult to understand for the Roman mindset was the attitude of Christians who rather chose torture or death instead of offering incense to the Roman emperor. From the Roman view, the refusal to venerate the Roman emperor was political treason. The edict of Milan which decreed tolerance of Christianity was followed by a time of parallel existence of Christianity and paganism which was, though, far from an actual religious pluralism - the religion of the emperor was always at an advantage, and the Arian, trinitarian and pagan emperors in the fourth century saw it as perfectly legitimate to take measures against religious leaders who did not share their belief. By the fifth century, the western Roman Empire had crumbled, but the same patterns of behavior continued in the eastern Roman Empire along with the Gaulish, Celtic, and Germanic kingdoms that replaced the west. =Middle Ages= After the breakdown of the Roman Empire in the west, in western Europe the population was a huge, diverse mix of Latin peoples, Germanic peoples who had been absorbed into the Empire and its Legions over the course of hundreds of years, and newly arriving Germanic tribes that were migrating into western Europe. In each of these vaguely defined categories were some Christians, some pagans, and some who subscribed to some elements of both. In the German tradition, the chief of the tribe was also religious leader, so conversion of the leaders (even if for political reasons) was followed in many cases by Christianization of the tribe - with the chief of the tribe being now the de facto head of the Christian church. There were very frequent instances of parallel pagan and Christian religion, but tolerance of old or new religion was up to the personal preference of the local lord. The tradition of the head of the tribe as head of the church was continued by the Kings which these chieftains eventually evolved into, with the king and/or emperor holding by virtue of office the right of investiture of bishops and also of deciding in religious matters - Charlemagne, e.g., took the Pope to task for not using the filioque in the Nicene Creed. The religion of the ruler was the official religion of the people and, again, any tolerance of foreigners or remnants of pagans was up to the present ruler. The unity of religion was generally seen as a prerequisite for any worldly state - a divergent religion was in the consequence not regarded just as a religious problem but also an action against state and ruler punishable by criminal law. In the high Middle Ages, the worldly powers clashed with the power of the pope on the matter of deciding about religious questions - while the details varied by country, the overall result was that the Roman Catholic Church was able to, for a short time, exercise control over the religious practices of countries, even against that Ruler's will. =Protestant Reformation= Confutatio Augustana (Catholic, on left) and Confessio Augustana (Lutheran, on right) being presented at the Diet of Augsburg. This picture is somewhat ahistorical because a written copy of the Confutatio was never provided by the Catholics; rather they had to go off of stenographers they had brought with them just in case the Catholics wouldn't give them a copy. Front page of the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, which recognized two different churches in the Holy Roman Empire. The Reformation resulted in a weakening of the power of the papacy, which was unable to control the spread of information such as Luther's Ninety-five theses. Although Jan Huss was burned at the stake in 1415, Luther's enemies were unable to do the same to him a century later due to protection from the local ruler of Saxony. The split between the Lutherans and the Catholics was made public and clear with the 1521 Edict of Worms: the edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas. Acceptance of the Lutherans was first granted in the 1530 Augsburg Confession and later the 1555 Peace of Augsburg. Although other Christian churches were not accepted, some of them found legal recognition when Phillip Melancthon agreed to publish an altered version of the Augsburg Confession. Luther brokered the 1525 treaty between Albert, Duke of Prussia and Sigismund I the Old that facilitated the expulsion of the Teutonic knights and the secularization of the Duchy of Prussia. The new state was officially Lutheran but in practice pluralistic. Following the legal principle of cuius regio, eius religio, states within the Holy Roman Empire following the 1555 Peace of Augsburg were officially the religion of the ruler. As a result emigration was sometimes necessary to avoid enforcement. Various religious refugees, such as the Huguenots, some Anglicans, Quakers, Anabaptists or even Jesuits or Capuchins were able to find refuge at Istanbul and in the Ottoman Empire, where they were given right of residence and worship. Further, the Ottomans supported the Calvinists in Transylvania and Hungary but also in France. The contemporary French thinker Jean Bodin wrote: In Transylvania it was declared in 1568 at Turda the religious tolerance for every religion and it was realised the religious pluralism. The role of authority was to supervise the peaceful religious cohabitation between Catholics, Calvinist, Lutheran, antirtinitarians, orthodox, sabbatharians, Jews and Muslims. The Transylvanian situation remained for long time an isolated fearful model of \\"diabolic liberty\\" (Beze, Basel,1569)but was well known and appreciated between religious persecuted antitrinitarians in Holland and in England. The Thirty Years' War began when the Protestant Frederick V, Elector Palatine accepted the throne of Bohemia from the Bohemian estates. This initiated the Thirty Years' War, one of the most destructive conflicts in human history. It was both a religious war (with Protestants hoping to preserve the freedoms of the Letter of Majesty) and a political war. Ottoman Turks and French Catholics fought on the \\"Protestant\\" side against the Habsburgs. The 1648 Peace of Westphalia brought an end to the European wars of religion and allowed the Protestant rulers to continue being Protestant. Theologically, the following syncretistic controversy prodded Protestants to understand and appreciate the Roman Catholic side more. Restrictions on smaller Protestant sects who disagreed with the national churches in these countries prompted such groups as the Pilgrim Fathers to seek freedom in North America, although when these became the majority they sometimes sought to deny this freedom to Jews and Roman Catholics. =Enlightenment= In the second half of the seventeenth century, partially out of being tired with the religious wars, partially influenced by early enlightenment, several countries adopted some sort of tolerance for other denominations, e.g. the Peace of Westphalia 1653 or the Edict of Tolerance in England in 1689. Protestant and freethinking philosophers like John Locke and Thomas Paine, who argued for tolerance and moderation in religion, were strongly influential on the Founding Fathers, and the modern religious freedom and equality underlying religious pluralism in the United States are guaranteed by First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states: :\\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\\" In the United States religious pluralism can be said to be overseen by the secular state, which guarantees equality under law between different religions, whether these religion have a handful of adherents or many millions. The state also guarantees the freedom of those who choose not to belong to any religion. While the United States had to begin with no dominant religion or denomination, this was very different in European countries who have, except for some Balkan states, a history with one dominant Christian denomination whose influence on their culture is felt until present times. Enlightenment in Europe did not so much promote the rights of minority religions but the rights of individuals to express beliefs diverging from the mainstream religion of the country, while belonging to that religion or being outside of it. While European countries generally went the way of gradually increasing the rights for minority denominations and religions, up to today the stress has been more on the freedom of belief of the individual, whereas the rights of religious organizations are often limited by the state to prevent them intruding upon the individual religious freedom.

The band is particularly notable for its support by Roger Daltrey of The Who, as well as for its later inclusion of Roy Kenner, formerly of The James Gang, as lead vocalist. History Law started out as a trio in Youngstown, Ohio and were formed in February 1971 by Steve Lawrence, Steve Acker and Mickey Williamson. The name came from their initials from each of their surnames. They were originally a three piece power trio and their music was similar to that of ZZ Top. They were known as a \\"boogie band \\"performing blues-based hard driving rock. Within a year of their creation they were opening for national acts such as Bob Seger, Edgar Winter's White Trash and Alice Cooper. In an outdoor show in Lake Milton with an audience of 5,000, as well as opening the program which featured various stars they also later performed as Chuck Berry's backup band.Steve Acker Website - The Story Of Law by Steve Acker They would also open shows for The Who in the seventies Steve Acker Website - How Roger Daltry and The Who Discovered and Signed Law to MCABrainchild Website - Band Bios Ronnie Lee Cunningham and later Jethro Tull and Earth Wind & Fire and Boston, Geocities Roy Kenner etc. One of the founding members Mickey Williamson had left the band in 1973 because of family commitments. Ronnie Lee Cunningham who the other two members had become friendly with was now available due to the breakup of his band Brainchild and he accepted their offer to replace Mickey Williamson. A bass player from Macon, Georgia, John McIvor was added as well. By the mid seventies the group was a 4-piece funk and rock band consisting of Ronnie Lee Cunningham on lead vocals and keyboards, John McIver on bass, Steve Lawrence on bass Tom Poole on drums and Steve Acker on guitar. Tom Poole had replaced their first drummer, Steve Lawrence. Steve Lawrence would rejoin the band at a later stage. They had signed with GRC Records and recorded their first album in 1975 at GRC Records studio. The album also featured Memphis Horns, Joe Lala on perussion and Albhy Galuten on Synthesizer.Discogs Law (5) - Law The album wasn't a success but Wake Up written by Ronnie Lee Cunningham caught the attention of Roger Daltrey. Daltrey and his manager Bill Curbishly signed Law to their production company. They put Law on tour with the Who and also signed them to MCA Records. Just before the spring of 1976, drummer Steve Lawrence would rejoin the band as Tom Poole's replacement. They also decided to add a second singer to their line up. On the suggestion of their producers, Ron and Howard Albert who had come up with a couple of singers who didn't get the job. The next consideration was Roy Kenner from the James Gang. Steve Acker flew to Toronto to interview him. Acker then invited him to join the band. Kenner accepted his offer and then moved to Ohio. This increased the group's line up to five.Steve acker Website How Roger Daltry and The Who Discovered and Signed Law to MCA The group broke up after the release of their second MCA album, Hold On to It. Possibly due to the multicultural nature of the group's music the band's albums they had trouble slotting into the radio format. With a lack of airplay, record sales were disappointing. Steve Acker had left the band in December 1977 and Law broke up. By 2014, Acker was the only charter member of LAW still working in the music business. In 1980, after moving to Jackson, Mississippi to re-join his family there, he wrote and produced a statewide hit rock record for Mississippi State University titled \\"Bulldog Blitz.\\" That year, he also wrote a eulogy for John Lennon which was published in a Jackson newspaper and was later selected by Yoko Ono for inclusion in the first Spirit Foundation book, \\"A Tribute to John Lennon.\\" Embarking on a 30-year career in advertising, Acker created numerous award-winning commercials, jingles, and ad campaigns for ad agencies in Jackson, MS and Nashville, Tennessee, including an adult literacy program for Dollar General Stores that received the Presidential Award for Private Initiatives from President Ronald Reagan and the Benjamin Franklin Award from the Saturday Evening Post. To date, 4.7 million Dollar General customers have learned to read or earned GED certificates as a result of Dollar General's promotional efforts. In 2007, Acker was signed to a development and production deal with the Studios @ SST in New York, NY, for whom he wrote numerous songs and documentary themes. Partnering with SST owner John Hanti in January 2012, he formed University Jams as an outgrowth of \\"Bulldog Blitz\\" to produce new college theme songs and fight songs. After Superstorm Sandy destroyed SST on October 28, 2012, Acker moved back to Mississippi to resume his advertising career. He continues to compose jingles and write songs and perform for occasional concerts.

While many overlay journals derive their content from preprint servers, others, such as the Lund Medical Faculty Monthly, contain mainly papers published by commercial publishers, but with links to self- archived preprint or postprints when possible. The editors of an overlay journal locate suitable material from open access repositories and public domain sources, read it, and evaluate its worth. This evaluation may take the form of the judgement of a single editor or editors, or a full peer review process. Public validation of subsequently approved texts may take several forms. At its most formal, the editor may republish the article with explicit approval. Approval might take the form of an addition to the text or its metadata. Or the editor may simply link to the article, via the table of contents of the overlay journal. An alternative approach is to link to articles already published in various open access ejournals, but adding value by grouping scattered articles together as a single themed issue of the overlay journal. Such themed issues allow the focussed coverage of relatively obscure or newly emerging topics. Episciences.org is an initiative by the Center for Direct Scientific Communication to host overlay journals.https://www.episciences.org/ In 2019, JMIR Publications, an open access publisher, announced the creation of a series of \\"superjournals\\", named JMIRx (JMIRx.org), which are overlay journals for preprint servers such as medrxiv, biorxiv and psyrxiv. History The term 'overlay journal' was first coined by Paul Ginsparg in 1996. That same year, the journal Physical Review began to link to pre-prints that they had accepted, but not yet published. It was not until later that the first overlay journals were founded, including Journal of High Energy Physics, Logical Methods in Computer Science and Geometry and Topology, all of which were overlays for arXiv.

Pupils that take part in the celebrations are known as russ. The russefeiring traditionally starts around 20 April (with some starting earlier/later depending on the regional county) and ends on 17 May, the Norwegian Constitution day. Participants wear coloured overalls (Usually red, blue, or black). Some form groups that name a bus, car or van (often making a name or logo). Some celebrate almost continually during this period. Drunkenness and public disturbances are regularly linked to the celebration. History The modern Norwegian russefeiring dates back to 1905, when the red russ caps (russelue) were introduced to graduation celebrations as a sign of the imminent acceptance into the system of higher education. The caps were initially only used by boys, and were inspired by German students, who in 1904 wore red caps when they visited Norway. In 1916, blue caps were introduced at the Oslo Commerce School, a prestigious high school specializing in economics, in order to separate them from the common graduates. Later, celebrations were gradually extended, similarly coloured overalls (russedress) were added, and the caps were saved for the final day of celebrations. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Nobel Prize laureate in literature, attempted to convey the spirit of the russ-celebration in the poem \\"Jeg velger meg April\\" (\\"I choose April\\"). The russ have figured in a number of poems and song lyrics, especially those from the early 20th century. As time passed, students graduating from vocational courses were allowed to participate in the celebrations, and additional overall and cap colours were gradually introduced by some of the vocational graduates. The celebrations then became a general celebration of the end of upper secondary school (videregående skole). In Norway, most pupils turn 18 just before the russefeiring. The age of 18 is both the age limit for buying alcohol and acquiring a driver's license. Therefore, the growing festivities also led to increased alcohol consumption, and in the '70s the tradition of buying old cars, vans, buses and even lorries and painting them in the same colours as the overalls became common. These cars would be extensively decorated, and serve as mobile homes and party venues for the russ during the russefeiring. They would be outfitted with tables, chairs, bunk beds, sound and lighting systems, and melodic horns. These vehicles were named russebiler (russ cars). Over the '80s it became fairly common to rip the cargo beds off lorries and build log cabins on the frames instead. However, due to safety issues this practice was banned during the early '90s. Also regulations were introduced that required every russ vehicle to have a designated non-russ driver. This, together with the no-tolerance policy on alcohol consumption by drivers introduced in the late 90s, greatly reduced the number of accidents involving russ vehicles. Russ cars and buses would gather for impromptu partying on school grounds, parking lots, beaches and other suitable places. Sometimes up to several hundreds of cars and buses would gather in one place. Eventually, these events became organized by commercial interests, who then also took over responsibility for the security of the participants. Still russ gather their vehicles for impromptu partying, but in smaller numbers. By the early 2000s authorities were once again worried about impact of the partying and alcohol consumption during the russefeiring. In an attempt to reduce the extent of the celebrations, some of the final exams in public schools were moved to early May. Traditionally, these had all been taking place in late May and early June. The idea was that forcing the pupils to prepare for exams instead of partying would reduce the extent of the problem. This had no noticeable effect, however, and resistance from pupils' organizations moved the exams back, with the argument that the only effect was to have pupils sacrifice grades for partying. Duration The festivities start anytime between 11 April and May 1 (different dates for each city). On this date, russ are allowed to put on their overalls, board their vehicles, and officially become russ. From then on celebrations continue almost non-stop until 17 May (the national day). On this day the russ are awarded their caps, and participate in the traditional 17 May parades. In the meantime, there are a number of smaller and bigger events for russ to participate in. The dates of the biggest parties are usually the 1st where the students are 'christened' with personalized russ names which are written on their caps, and 16 May, which is the second biggest party night, as these two dates are followed by national holidays (May day and Norwegian Constitution Day). Function Russefeiring is a long-standing tradition and a major cultural phenomenon in Norway. Apart from being a celebration of the imminent end of 12 or 13 years of compulsory schooling, it has also become a rite of passage into adulthood, and a farewell to classmates from the videregående skole (upper secondary school) who will now go their separate ways in search for jobs or higher education. It is therefore an important period in the lives of most Norwegian adolescents. In the period, there are several russetreff, translated russ meeting. At these events ten thousands of russ meet in an allocated area for one or more days. There are concerts, bus competitions in several circles (bus with the best sound systems, best lighting systems, best design, bus of the year and \\"Lord of the Rings\\"), and the sale of beer and food. While russefeiring is optional, there are few pupils who do not participate in any way, although the extent of involvement varies individually. However, there are pupils who, due to personal or religious reasons, do not consume alcohol, and therefore object to the nature of many of the celebrations, which contribute to its image as the \\"treukersfylla\\" (\\"the three-week binge\\"). These pupils do not partake in common festivities to the same degree that other russ do and sometimes create their own events such as the \\"kristenruss\\" (\\"christian russ\\"), do. =Overall colours= There are several different types of russ differing in the colour of the caps and traditional uniforms most students carry during the entire russ period. The colour of the uniforms usually reflects what type of study the person is completing (see below). However, in some regions such as Stavanger, the colour is determined by the school. Typically in these areas, if the headmaster of the school was a blue russ, the students will also be blue regardless of what they are studying (vocational students will still usually be black russ). ;Red (rødruss) :Allmennfag (general studies) (mathematics, physics, biology, history, literature, English etc); media and communication, art, music, dance and drama; and athletics. This is the most common colour. ;Blue (blåruss) :Business Administration studies (Økonomi & Administrasjon) ;Black (svartruss) :Vocational courses (like electronics, carpentry or culinary programs). As Norwegian vocational studies consist of 2 years of schooling and 1 or 2 years of apprenticeship, black russ can choose to celebrate at the end of school, at the end of the apprenticeship, or both. Some red russ choose black in order to stand out, although most red and blue russes do not acknowledge them as real russes. In fact, since most black russ are under 18 years old, they chose to order the red overalls in order to enter party sites where only those over 18 are allowed. ;Green (grønnruss) :Agricultural courses, also used by some as an alternative to orange russ. ;White (hvitruss) :In some regions, athletics students or healthcare students use white uniforms. Christian russ choosing to celebrate without alcohol sometimes use this colour, but most often wear the same colours as their classmates. Christian russ might form their own groups to have fun together without peer pressure towards drinking alcohol and achieving the knot requirements. ;Miscellaneous :Occasionally, children in the last year of kindergarten dress up as \\"pink russ\\" (rosaruss), or girls as pink russ and boys as light blue russ. In some places, pupils finishing the last year of middle school (ungdomsskolen) dress up as \\"orange russ\\" (oransjeruss) or \\"green russ\\" (grønnruss). These celebrations have not become very common. The russ board It is common to appoint a russpresident, a party coordinator, a newspaper editor, some journalists, a contraceptive responsible person and some other funny titles to some russ. The russepresident is responsible for about everything with the russ and to give an interview to a local newspaper and hold a speech on Constitution Day. The party coordinator organizes parties with different themes (for instance \\"What are you going to be when you're fully educated?\\", \\"bad taste\\" and \\"halloween\\"). The newspaper editor and the journalists make a russenewspaper. The contraceptive responsible gets some thousand condoms from the Red Cross to pass out to the russ (The Red Cross decided to give away condoms for free to russ because of the massive increase in Chlamydia, Herpes and Gonorrhea after May one year). \\"Knots and happenings\\" Ståkuka translates roughly to 'the noisy week', but there is a play with words involved as \\"ståkuk\\" literally means \\"erect penis\\". Ståkuka is the last week in April where there are different themes to dress up to. There is a different theme for each day and the typical themes are: * Change sex day * Army day * Pajamas day * Hero day * Emo day * Business day On army day it is very common for different schools or different coloured russ to \\"attack\\" each other with water balloons and water guns. Often younger students are taken hostage and dipped in water. This is typically frowned upon by teachers and cleaning staff as windows tend to be broken and hallways tend to be soaking wet. =Knots= The russ knots () on the string of the russ' cap are a wide variety of rewards signaling that the student has fulfilled a certain accomplishment during the russ period. They can be simple knots or tokens attached to the string. Lists of assignments and associated knots are publicized each year by russ committees at schools and communities. The knot often consists of an item representing the accomplishment. For instance, passing through the back seat of a car stopping on a red light (inspired by the television advertisement for the sweet Mentos), earns them a piece of wrapping from the sweet. The russ knot list was first introduced in the 1940s. The knot rules are sometimes criticized because they can involve illegal acts, such as public nudity or public sexual intercourse, outright assault and possibly self-harming actions such as consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short span of time (earning a beer cap or wine cork). Other more benign tasks exist, such as putting a for sale sign on a police car, or spending the night at a teacher's house and making him/her breakfast in the morning, all without being noticed. Counting both national and local lists, there can be hundreds of different tasks that can be performed to gain knots, with huge varieties between districts and individual schools. Due to criticism in media, many of the russ knots are removed and replaced by other knots every year to decrease its severe impact on the students. Some of the previous knots have been physically dangerous when it involves drinking 24 bottles of beer within 24 hours, or place half a box of snus under ones lip for a certain period of time. This can lead to alcohol poisoning and severe brain damage. A few russ knot examples: * Spending a night in a tree (earns a stick from the tree) * Eating a Big Mac hamburger in two bites (earns a piece of the wrapping) * Drinking a bottle of wine in 20 minutes (earns the wine cork) * Crawling through a supermarket while barking and biting customers' legs (earns a dog biscuit) * Spending a school day crawling on hands and knees (earns a toy shoe) * Spending the entire russ period sober (earns a fizzy drink cork) * Drinking 24 beers in 24 hours (girls) or 12 hours (boys) * Go for a swim before 1 May * Ask random people in a mall if they can lend one a condom (earns the condom) * Stage a false break up with a random 16-year-old in public * Sit in a roundabout with a sign saying in Norwegian: \\"\\" (\\"We'll have drink if you honk your horn!\\"). * Host an aerobic class at the local pub and get at least ten people to join. It is common for every school to have about 100 knots. If a russ does 50 or 70 of them he or she can choose to do three extra embarrassing or hard knots to become an eliteruss. A few eliteruss knot examples: * Tattoo Russ and the year thety were russ on their body (For instance \\"Russ 09\\"). * Make out with 10 people in one night. * Give more than (about and about ) to charity. * Dye their hair in the colour they are russ (black, red or blue). =Vans (Russebiler) and buses (Russebusser)= In the older days russ often traveled around in an open lorry, either used as-is or with a self-made log cabin added to the cargo area. Today, groups of russ commonly go together to buy a russ van. In eastern Norway, such as the capital Oslo, the posh suburb of Bærum, and other surrounding cities and areas, russ often choose to have a full-scale bus. This phenomenon also happens in the city of Stavanger and its surrounding areas. Russ vans are typically 15- to 20-year-old Volkswagen Caravelles or Chevy Vans. The vehicle is painted in their respective russ colour, either by having it professionally sprayed or with regular wall paint. Decals and other decorations are common. Russ vehicles bought cheap have a reputation for being in terrible technical condition. Inexperienced and intoxicated drivers, and in some cases even highly flammable alcohol spills, have contributed to fatal traffic accidents and fires in these vehicles. The Norwegian police take part in a concerted effort to improve the situation. Russ who acquire a bus are required by law to hire a professional bus driver for the duration of the celebration, while van drivers might be an older sibling, friend, or a russ who chooses to abstain from alcohol. In the russ vehicle, modern tradition requires a powerful audio equipment inside the vehicle, and on buses also on the roof (the largest systems allowed have forty speaker boxes which can generate over sixty thousand watts and be among the best sound systems in the world, rivaling those used by famous artists on concert tours). Some buses have had over 60 speaker boxes. Other accessories include sweaters and caps with the group's chosen logo and a bus song or slogan. It is also common to have some sort of theme for the interior and name/concept. Many buses have expensive theme interior, sometimes a bar, and plenty of flat-screens. A party light system is also common in buses. These buses can be a large financial burden; contributions of up to $30,000 per member have occurred. In some cases, the teenager's parents invest most of the money needed for the buses. However, the average is between $2000 and $6000 per member. Including sponsors, the cost of a bus can reach over . () While some are willing to spend very high sums of money during the russ festivities, mostly on the van/bus but also on clothes, effects, parties (there are special happenings for russ all over the country) and alcohol, most aim to buy a cheap van together with a group of friends. An old van can be passed on to the next generation of russ several times before it is discarded. It is customary to spend substantial amounts of time working on the vehicle, finding a concept, refurbishing the inside, painting the outside and applying for funding during the weeks (and sometimes years) before the festivities start. Logos of sponsors are written onto the vehicle together with other decorations. Some undertake major rebuilds of the interior, like building a bar counter or beds within the bus. It is not uncommon to start planning the bus several years before the celebration. Everything in the russ celebration is taken care of by the russ themselves, except the bigger events. In these events one will find shops where they sell alcohol and food, international artist performing and the most important, \\"russekåringen\\" (lit. \\"The Russ Awards\\"), where they designate the different buses as the winner of either the best theme, interior design, sound system, light system, best live- bus, and the most prestigious; the bus of the year. =Cards (Russekort)= Russekort from 2003 Most russ have personalized calling cards featuring their name, their photograph and a short slogan. These cards are swapped with other russ and handed out to children and family members. To many children, collecting russ cards is an important activity during the entire russ period, but especially May, culminating on May 17. =Newspapers (Russeavis)= To finance some of the administrative costs, many high schools create russ newspapers containing fake news, a column written by the russ president, official knot rules for the specific school, and other content, mostly humorous. The most important feature of a russ newspaper, however, is a section that presents every class and every student with a photograph and a personalized biography, typically written by friends in a jocular and satirical style. The class may also write a similar entry on their main teacher; the teacher, in turn, writes about their class. The Russ' newspaper is written and published by Russ' executive board (Russens Hovedstyre).

The MDC develops the necessary technology, partners, and services for enabling the creation of interoperable digital content distribution services. Marlin technology provides capabilities for consumers to manage the relationships among devices, network services, and digital content. With Marlin, service providers and device markers can create and support content services over open networks. History The MDC was formed in 2005 by five companies – Intertrust, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung and Sony. The MDC released the first set of specifications in May, 2006.http://www.marlin-community.com/content/may_8_2006 The Marlin Founders also formed the Marlin Trust Management Organization (MTMO) to act as a neutral trust management and licensing organization. The MTMO started commercial operations in January, 2007.http://www.marlin- community.com/content/january_4_2007 Technology Marlin was created with specific design goals. First, Marlin allows consumer devices to import content from multiple independent services and accommodate peer-to-peer interactions. Second, Marlin is based on a general-purpose rights management architecture. Marlin specifications define the capabilities and architecture so that devices and services can interoperate. Most Marlin implementations include the core system specification which defines the basic components, protocols, and consumer domain model that enable the interoperability between Marlin-enabled devices and services. This specification is based on the Octopus and NEMO reference technologies, which have been adapted for peer-to-peer device interactions. The rights management within Marlin is based on Octopus which is a general-purpose DRM architecture.http://www.intertrust.com/technologies/core_drm/octopus At the center of an Octopus system is a graph-based relationship engine. In Marlin, Octopus node objects are used to represent system entities (such as users and devices), and links between nodes represent relationships. The system of nodes and links manages where, how, and when content can be used in a Marlin system. Octopus runs on various platforms and is media format and cryptographically agnostic. NEMO is an acronym for Networked Environment for Media Orchestration.http://www.intertrust.com/technologies/core_drm/nemo It provides a services-based framework for trusted connections between various components of a Marlin DRM system. Based on Web Services standards, NEMO defines service interfaces, service access policies, and support for trust relationships among distributed entities that play well-defined and certified roles. The NEMO framework allows Marlin components to deliver protected messages and exchange them between authenticated and authorized entities. The services supported by NEMO may be operated together with other, application-specific media services that are not required to be NEMO-compliant. Products Primary products for implementation of Marlin include: * ExpressPlay: ExpressPlay is a hosted service provided by Intertrust and was introduced in May, 2013.http://www.intertrust.com/news/press/expressplay It is primarily designed to integrate Marlin content protection for Internet-based content distribution services. ExpressPlay provides a hosted Marlin server component for Marlin key management and a client-side SDK for iOS and Android. .https://www.expressplay.com/ * Bluewhale Marlin Broadband Server: The Bluewhale Marlin Broadband Server is a configurable implementation of a Marlin server providing the support necessary to secure the delivery of digital content to Marlin clients. In order to prepare appropriate information requested by clients, a Bluewhale server integrates with a service provider’s back-end business logic, using an XML-based interface. It translates the business logic into Marlin rights objects, creating and managing licenses and user registrations, for example. * Bento4 Packager: The Bento4 Packager is a software tool for content packaging and parsing that works with Marlin clients. This tool packages, encrypts and protects content files at the server side. On the client side, the tool provides content decryption and parsing. * Sushi Marlin Client SDK: The Sushi Marlin Client SDK is used to create client- side DRM functionality. This SDK provides the primary Marlin components necessary for determining license conditions and controlling access to protected content. It can be adapted for use in hardware devices and media playback and service access applications can also utilize it to provide DRM functionality. As of May 2013, Intertrust is no longer providing the Sushi Marlin Client SDK. Partners In October 2008, the MDC announced the formation of the Marlin Partner Program (MPP) with an initial launch including over 25 companies.http://www.marlin-community.com/news/partner_program_launch As of January, 2014, the Marlin web site listed 42 partner companies.http://www.marlin-community.com/partner Member partners identify, develop and provide a variety of technical components and integration services creating a marketplace of Marlin solutions. Network operators, service providers, device manufacturers, and other companies deploying Marlin-based products and services can work with MPP member companies. Trust services The technology is based upon open standards, but the security of the system is managed by an independent entity, the MTMO. The MTMO maintains the integrity and security of the system through its key management services. Deployment Marlin is commercially deployed worldwide on a variety of devices and services. Marlin is included in the national IPTV standard in Japan and has been deployed by Actvila, a web-based TV portal, launched in 2007. The Actvila service portal, created by partners Hitachi, Panasonic, Sharp, Sony, and Toshiba, included a roll-out of Internet-enabled TVs. Sony uses Marlin in the PlayStation Network, allowing users of the video download service to share purchased or rented content on PS3, PS4 and PSP systems. Televisions and Blu- ray players, which support the Philips Net TV service. The Tencent online video service. The following standard bodies have specified use of Marlin in their specifications: # UltraViolet the digital rights authentication and cloud-based distribution system standard from the Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem # The Open IPTV Forum The following national initiatives have selected Marlin: # The Italian Internet TV services platform developed by the Tivu consortium # YouView the open Internet connected platform for the United Kingdom. # The TNT 2.0 specifications from the HD-Forum France. Other consumer media services, such as Baidu-owned iQIYIhttp://www.intertrust.com/news/press/iQIYI and PPTVhttp://www.intertrust.com/news/press/pptv in China, have licensed Marlin.

It is located in the Westerberg area of the city in a former Muschelkalk quarry. Muschelkalk is a shell-bearing limestone typical to Central and Western Europe. The Botanic Garden is part of the University’s Faculty of Biology and Chemistry and was established in 1984. Main tasks of the Garden are education and research, as well as public relations.  Description  Swabian Jura in the Botanic Garden of Osnabrück It comprises an area of 8.4 ha, subdivided between two quarries. One quarry of 5.6 ha houses the outdoor display gardens as well as the glasshouse. The second quarry of 2.8 ha is a conservation area and home to rare plant associations typical to recently abandoned limestone quarries. The garden’s outdoor display areas show different plant communities from all over the world such as Mediterranean and alpine plants, or North American and Eurasian forests. There are also thematic collections of medical and aromatic plants and plant families (e.g. the garlic family or the heath family). In the Lowland Rainforest House more than 800 species of tropical plants provide an example for the vegetation of the Amazon basin.  Research  Allium caeruleum in the Allium bed Research in the Botanic Garden of Osnabrück focuses on biodiversity and the evolution of land plants. Special interest lies in the phylogeny of the genus Allium, which is in common name referred to as the onion genus. The Allium collection of the Botanic Garden comprises 230 species. Different departments, especially the Departments of Botany and Ecology, use the Botanic Garden for outdoor testing. The Botanic Garden of Osnabrück houses the Loki Schmidt-Genbank, a seed bank for wild plant conservation founded in 2003. The Garden also coordinates the WEL-Genbank (Genbank Wildpflanzen für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft). This seed bank, focusing on the conservation of the wild relatives of economically used plants, is under construction in cooperation with the Botanic Gardens of Berlin-Dahlem, Regensburg and Karlsruhe as well as the University of Education Karlsruhe.  Education  The collections of the Botanic Gardens are intensively used in biological education on the university level as well as on school level. Many biologists working on Bachelor-, Master-, Diplom- and Ph.D. theses collaborate with the Botanic Garden.  Public Relations  The Botanic Garden of Osnabrück attracts approximately 70,000 visitors a year. Entry is free. There are guided tours of the Garden on a regular basis, the so-called “Sonntagsspaziergänge”. The “Grüne Schule” offering these Sunday tours also provides a range of different thematic and seasonal tours which can be booked by interested groups. The offers and services of the “Grüne Schule” are especially aimed at children and groups of pupils, but there is also a variety of tours for adults. In 2010 400 guided tours of the Garden took place. Since 2011 there is also a self-guided tour available which is based on GPS Points of Interest. The Botanic Garden and its public relations are strongly supported by the about 300 members of the Friends of the Garden, organized in the “Freundeskreis des Botanischen Gartens der Universität Osnabrück e.V.”.

He is known as the founder of the shipping companies Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab and Hurtigruten. Background Richard Bernhard With was born at Tromsø in Troms, Norway. He was a son of shipmaster Sivert Regnor With (1810–97) and his wife Anne Bergitte Dahl (1814–ca 1875). His father was of Dutch descent and became a pioneer in shipping from Tromsøe. With took the mate's examination in Trondhjem during 1864, and then spent eight years at sea. In 1873 he settled in Risøyhamn as a merchant. In September the same year he married Oline Sophie Wennberg (1844–1878) in nearby Andenes. They had the child Nanna With in 1874. After the death of his first wife, he married her sister Augusta Septimia Wennberg (1847–1938). Career Richard With realized a growing transportation need in the region, particularly due to the widespread herring fishing, and was the driving force in the creation of Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab in 1881. The first two years, he was even the captain of the company's SS Vesteraalen. Two new ships were acquired in the 1880s; SS Lofoten was built and SS Fiskeren was bought. Trade routes were set up between Lofoten, Vesterålen and Senja in the north and Bergen in the south. In 1891, With took up the idea of establishing a year- round passenger route along the coast of Norway. In 1893 the Parliament of Norway agreed to the government's proposal of funding the route—Hurtigruten—with . The route Trondheim–Hammerfest (in the summer: Trondheim–Tromsø) would be sailed weekly, and was the first ship to sail on 2 July 1893. In 1894, With retired as a shipmaster and instead became CEO of Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab. He remained here until 1909. From 1896, Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab used SS Lofoten for a passenger route between Hammerfest and Adventfjorden. The shipmaster was renowned polar explorer Otto Sverdrup, and the route propelled growth of a modern society in the Svalbard archipelago. In 1908, With became involved in the work to create the Norwegian America Line. At its establishment in 1910, he served as deputy chairman of the board. Richard With memorial stone at Richard Withs plass in Tromsø With had been involved in local politics. He served as a member of the Parliament of Norway for the constituency Vesteraalen from 1910 to 1912. He then remained in Kristiania (now Oslo) and lived here until his death in February 1930. In 1896, he was made Knight 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. With was a leader of the Nordlendingenes Forening and in 1912, he was awarded the Petter Dass Metal (Petter Dass-medaljen). Legacy His name has been used for two Hurtigruten ships: SS Richard With (1909) and current MS Richard With (1993). In Tromsø there is a square named Richard Withs plass, while roads are named after him (Richard Withs gate or Richard Withs vei) in Andenes, Trondheim, Bodø, Sandnessjøen and Vardø.
