The winery is one of three Pavie estates, along with Ch√¢teau Pavie and Ch√¢teau Pavie-Decesse, located in the Right Bank of France‚Äôs Bordeaux wine region in the commune of Saint-√âmilion in the department Gironde. Having risen in esteem in the 1990s, it was promoted to Premier Grand Cru Class√© in 2006. The ch√¢teau also produces a second wine named Les Ch√™nes de Macquin (The Oaks of Macquin). History Once a part of the large estate of Ferdinand Bouffard, a 19th- century Bordeaux n√©gociant, it was acquired by Albert Macquin, also the owner of the neighbouring Ch√¢teau La Serre, who would become known as a pioneer in the battle against phylloxera, and whose vines at Pavie-Macquin were among the very first to be grafted onto American rootstocks. After studying viticulture at the Ecole d'Agriculture in Montpellier, Macquin was aware of the new techniques involving grafting the phylloxera resistant Vitis labrusca American rootstock onto the Vitis vinifera vines. While neighboring Chateaux were still looking for a cure to heal the infected vines, Macquin set about replanting his entire vineyard with the more resistant rootstock and was able to rebound more quickly from the phylloxera epidemic that plagued the Bordeaux wine industry. In Henri Enjalbert's description, \\"for more than 30 years Macquin was a one-man viticultural industry, the mastermind behind the transformation of the Saint-√âmilion vineyards.\\" The estate is currently owned by the Corre family, descendants of Albert Macquin, and is managed by Nicolas Thienpont with the oenologist St√©phane Derenoncourt in charge of vinification. The team of Thienpont and Derenoncourt has been credited with increasing the profile of Pavie-Macquin in recent years, introducing biodynamic viticulture and more modern winemaking techniques. In 2006, the Ch√¢teau was promoted from Grands crus class√©s to Premiers grands crus class√©s B in the Saint-√âmilion wine classification.M.

Her middle name is frequently misspelled Muir.  Life  Mackenzie was the daughter of physician and surgeon Dr Murdoch Mackenzie and Sarah Agnes Mackenzie (n√©e Drake), Agnes was born in Stornoway on Lewis, then a busy fishing port. In childhood she was taken seriously ill with scarlet fever, the after-effects of which left her with poor hearing and eyesight. Educated at home until the age of fourteen, she then attended the Nicolson Institute until the age of seventeen. She then left Lewis for Aberdeen. As an undergraduate at the University of Aberdeen she studied English literature and edited the university magazine. During the First World War she was an assistant lecturer at the University and an instructor at the local teacher training centre. After the war she worked as an assistant lecturer at Birkbeck College but was dismissed after five years. She described herself as having \\"no money, no sort of influence, and no professional training of any kind, except a completely useless Arts degree\\". This crisis led to her career as a novelist. Her first novel Without Conditions was published in 1923--The Quiet Lady, a semi-sequel, appeared in 1926-- and her dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Letters, The women in Shakespeare's plays, was published in 1924. Seen as a \\"new and distinctly feminist approach to the topic\\" (Noble, quoting Lenz, Greene & Neely (eds), The Women's Part: Feminist Criticism of Shakespeare), this was reprinted on four occasions during the twentieth century. She published two more novels, a play, two works of literary criticism--The Process of Literature and The Playgoer‚Äôs Handbook to the English Renaissance Drama--during the 1920s. Mackenzie was a frequent contributor of reviews to The Times Literary Supplement and the New Statesman, she also lectured, and worked as a reader for publishers. It appeared as though Mackenzie would return to working as an educator when she was hired to teach an adult education course on Scottish literature. However, enrollments for the course were insufficient and it was cancelled. She made use of her preparations for teaching the course to produce An Historical Survey of Scottish Literature to 1714, published in 1933. This work also led to her 1934 biography of King Robert, Robert Bruce, King of Scots. A controversial work, but well received by the reading public and reprinted, Mackenzie's study was the first serious effort which matched the popular conception of Bruce as hero, rather than the hitherto predominant academic view of Bruce as \\"a treacherous and rather contemptible figure\\" (Noble, quoting Mackenzie). She wrote two historical novels for younger readers on Bruce's life, I was at Bannockburn (1939) and Apprentice Majesty (1950). Robert Bruce, King of Scots was retrospectively subsumed into Mackenzie's six-volume history of Scotland as volume two. The other volumes were The Foundations of Scotland (1938), The Rise of the Stewarts (1935), The Scotland of Queen Mary and the religious wars 1513-1638 (1936), The Passing of the Stewarts (1937), and Scotland in modern times 1720-1939 (1941). The single-volume The Kingdom of Scotland: a short History appeared in 1940, while a school textbook history, A History of Britain and Europe for Scottish Schools, was published in 1949. She also produced a four-volume series, Scottish Pageant (1946-1950), which presented translated excerpts from documents relating to Scotland for a mass audience. A member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, Mackenzie was not afraid to criticise Scotland's sacred cows, comparing John Knox to Adolf Hitler and describing John Calvin's Geneva as a totalitarian statelet. In 1941 she was elected as the Honorary President of the Saltire Society. Her 1942 pamphlet for the Society, The Arts and the Future of Scotland, rejected the idea of national art as proposed by Hugh MacDiarmid and J. D. Fergusson. She was made a commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1945 for services to Scottish literature and Scottish history. In 1951 she received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Aberdeen. She died suddenly in Edinburgh in 1955, and was buried in Grange Cemetery. The Saltire Society established the Saltire History Book of the Year Award in her honour on the tenth anniversary of her death.

The Geography of South India comprises the diverse topological and climatic patterns of South India. South India is a peninsula in the shape of a vast inverted triangle, bounded on the west by the Arabian Sea, on the east by the Bay of Bengal and on the north by the Vindhya and Satpura ranges. Technically all Indian territories below the 20th Parallel. The Satpura ranges define the northern spur of the Deccan plateau, one of the main geographic features of South India. The Western Ghats, along the western coast, mark another boundary of the plateau. The narrow strip of verdant land between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea is the Konkan region; the term encompasses the area south of the Narmada as far as Coastal Karnataka. The Western Ghats continue south, forming the Malnad (Canara) region along the Karnataka coast, and terminate at the Nilgiri mountains, an inward (easterly) extension of the Western Ghats. The Nilgiris run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka, encompassing the Palakkad and Wayanad hills, and the Satyamangalam ranges, and extending on to the relatively low-lying hills of the Eastern Ghats, on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh border. The Tirupati and Anaimalai hills form part of this range. The Deccan plateau, covering the major portion of the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, is the vast elevated region bound by the C-shape defined by all these mountain ranges. No major elevations border the plateau to the east, and it slopes gently from the Western Ghats to the eastern coast.  Geological development  India is entirely contained on the Indian Plate, a major tectonic plate that was formed when it split off from the left over land of the ancient continent Gondwanaland. About 91 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous Period, the Indian Plate began moving north at about 15 cm/yr (6 in/yr). The vast volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period, between 67 and 66 million years ago. Some paleontologists speculate that this eruption may have accelerated the extinction of the dinosaurs. Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many thousands of years, and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table. Hence it is also known as Table Top. The volcanic hotspot that produced the Deccan traps is hypothesized to lie under the present day island of R√©union in the Indian Ocean.  Climate  The region has a very [tropical climate] with the monsoons playing a major part. The southwest monsoon accounts for most of the rainfall in the region and much of it falls from about June to October. Tamil Nadu and southeast Andhra Pradesh receive rains from the northeast monsoon from about November to February. Much of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka has a distinct dry season from about October - May when there is not much rainfall. This region also experiences cooler nights from October to March while the days are pleasantly warm. In the northern parts of the region temperatures can fall below 10 degrees Celsius on occasions at night during this time. Days are very hot from March to June when temperatures can go over 40 degrees.  States and Union Territories  South India includes five states ‚Äì Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana ‚Äì where the official and majority languages are Dravidian languages. State boundaries generally follow linguistic lines. The northern portion of the Western Ghats and Deccan plateau are in the states of Goa and Maharashtra, although these states are often classed in Western India. The official and majority languages in Goa and Maharashtra are Indo-European languages. South India also has two Union territories, Puducherry and Lakshadweep.  Regions  South India has a number of overlapping traditional geographic regions. Some of these regions are: * Bayaluseemae- The plain area of Deccan plateau in Karnataka * Carnatic - etymologically related to the Deccan, refers to all of South India * Canara or Karaavali - the Karnataka coast * Chera Nadu - Western Tamil Nadu and most of modern Kerala * Chettinadu - Central Tamil Nadu surrounding Sivagangai * Chola Nadu - Central Tamil Nadu surrounding Thanjavur * Coromandel Coast - south coastal Andhra Pradesh, north coastal Tamil Nadu and the Puducherry Union Territory * Deccan - plateau region covering interior Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Includes the Marathwada, Vidarbha, Telangana, Rayalaseema, North Karnataka and Mysore regions. * Kammanadu - Region south of Krishna river up to Nellore * Kongu Nadu - Western Tamil Nadu surrounding Coimbatore * Konkan - coastal region comprising coastal Maharashtra, Goa and part of coastal Karnataka * Kosta - Coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh * Malabar region - Northern Kerala * Malenadu - Sahyadri hills between the coast and the plateau in Karnataka * Mulakanadu - Region to the north of the Godavari river * Mysore - South Karnataka around Mysore * North Karnataka - North Karnataka around Dharawad * Northern Circars - Muslim administrative units in Madras state in British India, namely Chicacole, Rajahmundry, Ellore, Kondapalli and Guntur * Palnadu - Northern Tamil Nadu and Southern districts of Andhra Pradesh * Pandya Nadu - Central and southern Tamil Nadu around Madurai * Raichur Doab - mostly northern Karnataka, between the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers * Rayalaseema - Southern Andhra Pradesh consisting of Kurnool, Chittor, Cuddapah and Anantapura districts * Tondai Nadu - Central Tamil Nadu around Pudukkotai * Thiruvithaamkoor or Travancore - Southern Kerala * Tulu Nadu - Coastal districts of Udupi and South Canara in Karnataka * Velanadu - Places on the banks of Krishna River from Guntur to Srisailam The low-lying coral islands of Lakshadweep are off the south-western coast of India. Sri Lanka lies off the south-eastern coast, separated from India by the Palk Strait and the chain of low sandbars and islands known as Rama's Bridge. The Andaman and Nicobar islands lie far off the eastern coast of India, near the Tenasserim coast of Burma. The southernmost tip of mainland India is at Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) on the Indian Ocean.  Water bodies  The rivers of Southern India Rivers of South India are dependent on the monsoons and shrink during the dry season. The line created by the Narmada River and Mahanadi river is the traditional boundary between northern and southern India. The Narmada flows westwards in the depression between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges. The plateau is watered by the east flowing Godavari and Krishna rivers. The other major rivers of the Deccan plateau are the Pennar and the Tungabhadra, a major tributary of the Krishna. The river Kaveri rises in the Western Ghats, in the Kodagu district of Karnataka and flows through the fertile Mandya, Mysore, Hassan regions before entering Tamil Nadu, where it forms an extensive and fertile delta on the east coast. The three major river deltas of South India, the Kaveri, the Godavari and the Krishna, are located along the Bay of Bengal. These areas constitute the rice bowls of South India. Rivers that flow westward, from the mountains to the Arabian Sea, include the Periyar River, Netravati River, Mandovi and Tapti River (or Tapi) rivers, and the Narmada at the northern edge of the region.  Flora and fauna  There is a large number and wide diversity of plants and animals in South India, resulting from its varied climates and geography. Tropical moist forests are found along the Arabian Sea coast and the Western Ghats. The Malabar Coast moist forests are found on the coastal plains. The South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests are found at intermediate elevations. The southern Western Ghats have high altitude rain forests called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests. The Western Ghats are a biodiversity hotspot. Scrub lands, including the Deccan thorn scrub forests, are common in the interior Deccan plateau. Some of India's famous protected areas are found in South India. These include Project Tiger reserves Periyar National Park, Kalakad - Mundanthurai and Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve. Important ecological regions of South India are the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, located at the conjunction of the borders of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the Nilgiri Hills including Mudumalai National Park, Bandipur National Park, Nagarhole National Park Silent Valley National Park, Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary and the Anamalai Hills including the Eravikulam National Park, Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary and the adjacent The Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park of the Western Ghats. Important bird sanctuaries including Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, Nelapattu and Pulicat Sanctuary are home to numerous migratory and local birds. Other protected ecological sites include the backwaters like the Pulicat Lake in Andhra Pradesh, Pitchavaram in Tamil Nadu and the famed backwaters of Kerala formed by the Vembanad Lake, the Ashtamudi Lake and the Kayamkulam Lake.

Frank Kortan (born April 22, 1964 in Prague, Czech Republic) is a German painter, who works in style of surrealism, fantastical realism and trompe-l'oeil, he is a winner of World Prize of Salvador Dal√≠ for fine arts. He lives and works in Egloffstein Bavaria (Germany). Life and work He started his professional artistic career as a musician, in 1984 he emigrated to Tessino (Switzerland), after one year he moved to Germany. In the early nineties he met the German artistic scene, which worked in the style of \\"Trompe-l'oeil\\" (optical illusion) which is an art technique that uses realistic imagery to create the optical illusion that the depicted objects exist in three dimensions. This fine technique, which was already used by the old masters fascinated him. He begins to study this technique intensively so that he can implement his ideas and themes without any technical limitation. But only the \\"trompe l'oeil\\" style, which mainly represents a classical still life, is not enough for him, he combines it with Fantastic Realism and Surrealism in order to transform his thoughts into surreal and magical compositions. In his works he implements historical themes that are composed of reality, imagination and hiding humor. Not only historical personalities such as Wolfgang Amadeus, Mozart, Johann Sebastian Bach, or Franz Kafka are portrayed in his unique style, but also contemporary personalities, such as the writer Ephraim Kishon or the singer Karel Gott are portrayed by him. Since 2003 he is a Knight of the Order Ordo Sancti Constantini Magni. His paintings were seen in numerous solo and group exhibitions and his works are in private as well as in public collections.

First World War The squadron was first formed as No. 12 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service, a training unit of No. 1 Wing, founded at Hondschoote on 8 June 1917. However, unlike other RNAS units it was not absorbed into the RAF as No. 212 Squadron, and was disbanded on 1 April 1918. On 20 August 1918 Flights 490, 557 and 558 of the former RNAS base at Great Yarmouth were formed into No. 212 Squadron RAF. Flying the DH4, DH9 and DH9A, it carried out anti- submarine patrols over the North Sea until the end of the war. In March 1919 it moved to Swingate Down near Dover, and was disbanded on 9 February 1920. Second World War In early 1940 a detachment from the Photographic Development Unit was sent to France, and was designated No. 212 Squadron on 10 February 1940. Operating the Spitfire and Blenheim it flew strategic reconnaissance sorties over Germany until being evacuated to Britain following the fall of France. It was disbanded on 18 June. The squadron was reformed on 22 October 1942 to operate the Catalina in the air-sea rescue and anti- submarine warfare role over the Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, and along the coasts of India and Burma. It was based at Korangi Creek near Karachi, with detachments at Umm Rasays, Masirah, in Oman, and Calcutta in East India.

By teaching them the methods and tactics of terrorism, those conducting such facilities aim to create an \\"army\\" of individuals who will do their bidding. They are often located in, but not confined to, regions where it is intended that acts of terrorism will be carried out, or in traditional areas of extremism, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Somalia. Wide-open spaces such as parks and wilderness areas are common sites for these camps. Despite the destruction of many jihadist training facilities, numerous camps are known to still exist. Terrorist groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Al Nusra Front (ANF) continue to provide these facilities. Camps usually include basic physical fitness training, progression to weapons training and armed assault techniques and potentially instruction in bomb making. Individuals in these camps will also be given guidance to help them avoid coming to the attention of the authorities, and on communicating securely. In most cases, these camps take place in parts of the world which are far from safe, such as Syria, Iraq and Somalia and spending time there will involve physical hardship and danger. The trainee will have to satisfy those providing the training of their commitment and loyalty.  Locations  Many camps are located in regions of conflict. The call to jihad has seen many Muslims enter such camps, followed by US drone strikes. Abu Hamza al-Masri was indicted in a conspiracy to attempt to establish a \\"terrorist training camp\\" in late 1999 and early 2000 with Taliban supporter Earnest James Ujaama who traveled to Bly, Oregon, with a dozen men from his Seattle house of worship. Ujaama is a US citizen who had met Abu Hamza in England in 1999 and was indicted in the US for providing aid to al-Qaeda, attempting to establish a terrorist training camp, and for running a website advocating global jihad.

In Amalia, New Mexico in the United States of America, in the summer of 2018 on a remote site with a small camping trailer within a surrounding wall of car tires, 5 adults, 11 hungry children (ages 1 to 15), and later a dead child, were found. Court documents stated the children had been trained for shootings at schools.Prosecutor: Man at New Mexico compound trained kids for school shooting timesofisrael.com, 9 August 2018. Federal terrorism, kidnapping, and firearms charges were brought against five adults in March 2019. Purpose These encampments provide recruits with weapons training, protocol training, interaction with skilled veterans, and a secure geographic location for operations. Recruits are regularly indoctrinated in the goals and beliefs of the organization. Organizational leaders attempt to isolate recruits from their outside social connections and force them to establish a new identity. This allows the organization to become the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù of the recruit and generate loyalty to the organization's goals.  Psychological traits  Depending on the type of organization, the religion and ‚Äústrength of faith‚Äù of the recruit is often an indicator of their status within the organization. Those who are not willing to comply, even after completion of training, are often punished and undergo training to strengthen their observance. Terrorist recruits are tested on knowledge of their religion and of rival groups. Recruiters do this to verify that each recruit has the necessary beliefs, which ensures organizational unification. Religious verification ensures that each member is working towards mutual goals. Recruiters use techniques that exploit or create mental trauma in order to produce a dissociated mindset in recruits ‚Äî a condition in which the identity and awareness of the recruit is reset. Typical recruits look to join terrorist organizations because they are angry, alienated and/or disenfranchised. Common thought processes include: believing that their current political involvement does not give them the power to effect change; identifying with perceived victims of the perceived social injustice they are fighting; feeling the need to take action; believing that violence is not immoral; having friends or family sympathetic to the cause; and craving social and psychological rewards such as adventure, camaraderie, and a heightened sense of identity. Internet and cyber-skills are sought after as technically knowledgeable recruits can help the organization.  Examples of physical demands  Many terrorist organizations train recruits in guerrilla warfare. Recruits must be in shape in order to learn these tactics. An ISIS workout video shows that cardiovascular fitness is important. Recruits often train in full uniform, with weapons in hand. Recruits need to be able to survive in their environment with little nourishment. Recruits learn that if success is not attained, they will not be rescued.  Known locations of terrorist training camps  Abu Isa training camp is an ISIL training camp located in Ninewa whose trainer was identified as Jundullah al-Azeri.

The method is notable in that, unlike other forms of musical analysis, it is designed to be presented in musical sound alone, without any words being heard or read, and without analytic diagrams of any kind. For this purpose, Keller would construct an analysis in the form of an analytic score written for the same forces as the work under consideration and structured as a succession of 'analytic interludes' designed to be played between its movements. The focus of such an analysis was the question of how a masterwork could incorporate strongly contrasting ideas and yet still produce the experience of unity and coherence. Keller's position on this issue was made clear in a number of articles: Thus his 'FA' scores are designed to demonstrate that the rich 'foreground diversity' of a piece of great music is 'unified' at a 'background' level. To this end the analytic interludes juxtapose passages of the original work with aural demonstrations of the links between the work's various ideas, seeking to make audible to the listener a normally hidden and unnoticed 'latent unity' underlying the 'manifest contrasts'. Keller produced more than a dozen of these analytic scores, with the works analysed being by Johann Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven and Benjamin Britten. Several were broadcast on BBC radio and on the Continent in the 1950s and '60s, though only two were published during his lifetime. The development of the wordless method did not mean that Keller ceased to produce verbal articles and talks on music; in his view, however: Keller's investigations into 'the unity of contrasts' were influenced by the analytic writings of Schoenberg and Rudolph Reti, both of whom he acknowledged. His discussion of 'manifest' contrasts and a 'latent' level of unity requiring to be revealed through analysis is explicitly indebted to Sigmund Freud's model of dream-formation, which distinguishes between the 'manifest' content of the dream and the 'latent' dream-thought.

He was one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland, a friend and disciple of Saint Columba. Background In early Christian Ireland the druid tradition collapsed with the spread of the new faith. Study of Latin learning and Christian theology in monasteries flourished. Brendan became a pupil at the monastic school at Clonard Abbey. During the sixth century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Christianity studied at the Clonard monastery. It is said that the average number of scholars under instruction at Clonard was 3,000. Twelve students who studied under Saint Finian became known as the Twelve Apostles of Ireland; Brendan of Birr was one of these. Life Brendan of Birr is said to have been of a noble Munster family. It was at Clonard that Brendan became a friend and companion of Ciar√°n of Saigir and Brendan of Clonfert. He founded the monastery at BirrDuffy, Patrick. \\"Brendan of Birr, Abbot\\", Caitlicigh Ar An nGreasan in central Ireland in about 540, serving as its abbot. He emerges from early Irish writings as a man of generous hospitality with a reputation for sanctity and spirituality who was an intuitive judge of character. He was considered one of the chief prophets of Ireland. This is evidenced both in his title ('Prophet of Ireland'), and by his attendance at the synod of Meltown, in which Saint Columba was brought to trial over his role in the Battle of C√∫l Dreimhne in 561. Brendan spoke on Columba's behalf, prompting the assembled clerics to sentence Columba with exile rather than excommunication. His friendship and support for Columba resulted in important connections between Birr and the Columban foundations. An adviser of Columba said that the saint saw a vision of Brendan's soul being carried away by angels after his death. He thereupon ordered for a mass to be said in his honour. The feast day of Brendan of Birr is 29 November. Brendan's monastery at Birr was later to produce the MacRegol Gospels, which are now housed at the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

It originates in highlands between Red Hill and Mount Burdell above the city of Novato, California, and flows before emptying into San Pablo Bay south of Petaluma Point. History Miwok and Pomo people were the earliest residents of the watershed. Olompali, the site of a significant Miwok village, is located at the southern base of Mt. Burdell. In 1839 Mexican land grants established Rancho Novato. Grazing brought a host of invasive annual grassland plants that eventually dominated the deep-rooted native perennial grasses and altered runoff rates. By 1856 extensive apple orchards occupied the valley floor and many of the creeks had been channelized for irrigation. The tidal marshlands had also been diked and drained for agriculture (primarily oat-hay production) by the middle of the nineteenth century. In the 1880s the creek was dredged to make way for schooners bound for San Francisco. Novato, one of the four townships in existence when Marin County formed in 1850, was incorporated in 1960. Ground was broken for Hamilton Air Force Base in 1932 and dedicated in 1935 (the base was decommissioned in 1974, and designated as a historic district in 1988). Land use changes have increased sediment supply and decreased sediment transport, causing the lower reaches of Novato Creek to become shallower. In addition, the construction of Stafford Dam (starting in 1952) increased its drainage area by . Watershed and course Novato Creek in summer 2016 The Novato Creek watershed basin is . Novato Creek is joined (heading downstream) by six major tributaries along its length: Leveroni, Bowman Canyon, Warner, Vineyard Creek, Arroyo Avichi, Arroyo de San Jose, and Simmonds Slough. Arroyo San Jose itself has two tributaries. It is joined on the left by Ignacio Creek and on the right by Pacheco Creek (at Pacheco Pond) just before entering Novato Creek. Novato Creek and its tributaries are often eroded, incised channels. It is one of the driest watersheds in Marin County. Novato Creek begins to the west of Mount Burdell and initially descends to the west. However, it soon turns south, then east to feed into Stafford Lake. It descends through the city of Novato. East of Novato it crosses under U.S. Route 101 and State Route 37 before flowing through Bel Marin Keys and entering the northwest corner of San Pablo Bay. Just before entering the Bay, Novato Creek flows along Bel Marin Keys, a community on the creek and a series of adjacent lagoons, at an elevation of above sea level. Ecology Salmonids (steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)) are also found within the Novato Creek watershed. The Novato Creek watershed is known to support 10 extant fish species (6 native and 4 introduced). Native species include California roach, Sacramento pikeminnow, Sacramento sucker, steelhead, threespine stickleback, and Prickly sculpin. Introduced species include rainwater killifish, western mosquitofish, striped bass, and green sunfish. Fawcett (2000 and 2006) also noted the presence of non-native bluegill, largemouth bass, brown bullhead, chameleon goby, and inland silverside. Historically, the watershed supported native tidewater goby; the last collection occurred in 1945. Wetland-adapted species occur along Rush Creek and the lower Novato Creek wetlands. Noteworthy species include San Pablo song sparrow, California black rail, saltmarsh common yellowthroat, and California clapper rail. Western pond turtles and naturalized bullfrogs are known to occur in Novato Creek.

The road linking the two settlements is now known as Turnhurst Road and the area where the former estate was located is now known as Turnhurst. The most famous resident was canal pioneer James Brindley who is said to have perfected models of his canal locks in the grounds of the house. The estate was originally used for farming, but was later mined for coal and iron ore. Early history = Etymology= Turnhurst means \\"estate on the wooded hill\\", (from Old English, tun means \\"enclosure, farm or estate\\" and hurst means \\"wooded hill\\").Wikipedia: List of generic forms in British place names =Description= Turnhurst Hall was a substantial house built around 1700 on the site of a former dwellingKlemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.5. set in of farmland. Never a great or wealthy country seat, Turnhurst is described as being typical of the houses of lesser gentry.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.1. A comfortable, roomy, old-fashioned dwelling which was said to have been the last house in England in which a family fool was maintained.Smiles 1862, p.468. The Hall was divided into two residences from the time of the Alsagers ownershipCole family papers as documented dates of residence confirm. This fact has caused some confusion to historians dating occupancy. =Earliest References= The earliest record known is from the 1539 General Muster Roll of Henry VIII which lists a William Rowley of Turnhurste indicating that there was a residence at the site before the Hall was built.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.6. A number of writers refer to still earlier occupation of Turnhurst, but no primary records support this as fact. Residents of Turnhurst = Rowley= The Rowley family was seated at Turnhurst in ancient timesWard 1843, p.176. and first appears in parish registers in 1626.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.6. =Bellot= Four members of the Bellot family took the title baronet of Moreton in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Sir Thomas Bellot 2nd Bt and Sir John Bellot 3rd Bt were Members of Parliament for Newcastle-under- Lyme. On the death of the 3rd Bt, his brother Thomas took the title of 4th Bt.Hayton, Cruickshanks & Hadley 2002, p.171. The last Sir Thomas Bellot was a keen sportsman and panels of several of the upper rooms depicted some of his exploits in the field.Smiles 1862, p.468. =Bowyer= The Bowyer family features in legal documents relating to Turnhurst between 1690 and 1740. In particular a 1690 marriage settlement for Katherine Bowyer who married into the Rowley family at Turnhurst. Mentioned in the settlement are Rowley, Bellot and Sir John Bowyer of Knypersley.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.9-10. Deeds to the estate show occupancy by John Bowyer and Francis Egerton in 1752.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.11. =Alsager= Edward Cole of Turnhurst 1803-1853. The first reference to Alsager appears in 1672 with the marriage of Ralph Alsager to Sarah Rowley of Turnhurst.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.9. In 1752 the Turnhurst estate was purchased outright, in trust for Mary Alsager.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.10. Mary Alsager was to own the estate for the period of Brindley's occupation, and following her death in 1795 was managed by trustees until 1846.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.11-12. =Cole= John Cole and Barbara Scott moved to Turnhurst after their marriage in 1745.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.11. Cole was a farmer who bred prize winning longhorn cattle on the estate.Cole family papers The Coles were tenants of Mary Alsager alongside James Brindley and were granted a lease in 1766 for 21 years.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.11. Further leases survive detailing the Cole tenancy into the 19th century.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.12. Civil records improved in the mid-19th century and many references to the Coles at Turnhurst are available. The 1841 Census shows Benjamin Cole and his family in residenceUK Census 1841 and by the 1851 Census it was Edward Cole who occupied the Hall.UK Census 1851 In 1849 John Hilditch Cole, son of Edward, was born at Turnhurst.Birth of John Hilditch Cole 1849 Edward Cole died in 1856 and the Coles finally left Turnhurst and moved to Ford Green Hall, then owned by Robert Heath of KidsgroveCole family papers who was the brother of Edward's widow. =James Brindley= James Brindley. James Brindley was a pioneering canal engineer and the most notable resident of Turnhurst. Although Mary Alsager did not routinely occupy the Hall, in the original lease to the Coles she did retain an option to occupy significant parts of the Hall.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.12. Such an option effectively sub-divided the residence and it was the half of the Hall which Mary Alsager reserved that James Brindley occupied.Cole family papers Brindley married his young bride, Ann Henshall, in 1765 and together they moved into Turnhurst Hall where he was to live until his death in 1772.Smiles 1862, p.468. Brindley mixed with some of the finest minds in England during this time as his friend Josiah Wedgwood introduced him to the eminent physician and polymath Erasmus Darwin and other illustrious members of the Lunar Circle.Corble 2005, p.54. Erasmus Darwin attended Brindley at Turnhurst towards the end of his life and diagnosed his advanced diabetes mellitus.Smith 2005, p.48-49. Brindley died at Turnhurst Hall on 27 September 1772.Ward 1843, p.174. Following Brindley's death, Darwin wrote to Wedgwood to suggest that a memorial to Brindley be erected in Westminster Abbey.Darwin Letter 1772 Demise of Turnhurst Hall During the 19th century large parts of Staffordshire were extensively mined. The Turnhurst estate overlay a rich geology and the rural country seat gave way to the commercial demands for its mineral bounty. In 1862 the estate was sold for auctionAuction Sale 1862 and its mineral resources listed. The sale catalogue included geological sections through the estate and listed 16 mines producing coal and iron ore, as well as deposits of clay, marl and sand. The Hall suffered subsidence towards the turn of the 20th century and was finally demolished in 1929.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.25. Brindley's Lock Local tradition maintains that James Brindley built a model canal lock at TurnhurstKlemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.13. and late 19th century newspaper articles even describe the canal as being present on the estate.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.23. A linear feature with the appearance of a canal section had been identified on 19th century estate plans. In 1993 an archaeological excavation revealed the canalKlemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.28. with a sluice gate built into the southern end wall.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.30. Examination of the find led to the conclusion that it was most likely a water feature contemporary with the Hall and pre-dated Brindley's residence.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.32. However it was possible that modifications had been made in the late 18th century, including the addition of the sluice, and the feature may have served as a water holding tank for canal experiments.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.34. Turnhurst today The Turnhurst estate is now the site of a modern housing development. The Hall itself was near to where the eastern end of Silverstone Crescent now joins Turnhurst Road, and the water feature long thought to have been Brindley's canal lies beneath a protective concrete raft under the car park of the aptly named The Brindley Lock public house.Klemperer & Sillitoe 1995, p.38.

Swire attained his physiotherapy qualification from the University of Salford's School of Physiotherapy in 1985, before completing a postgraduate diploma in Sports Injury, Neuromusculoskeletal Dysfunction and Manual Therapy and earning an MSc in Sports and Exercise. Before taking a job in football, Swire worked at a private sports injury clinic. In 1991, he was hired as an assistant physiotherapist at Manchester United, first under Jim McGregor and then under David Fevre. When Fevre followed Brian Kidd to Blackburn Rovers in 1999, Swire was promoted to the position of chief physiotherapist, a position he held for the next 15 years. In the run-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Swire was involved in the early stages of Wayne Rooney's recovery and rehabilitation from the foot injury he suffered six weeks before England were due to play their first match. Although Rooney was not fit for the first game, he made a substitute appearance in the second match against Trinidad and Tobago, playing 32 minutes of the match. This recovery was attributed to the methods used by the physios who treated Rooney, including Swire. Following a recurrence of Rooney's metatarsal injury in August 2007, Swire was charged by Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson with finding out the cause of Rooney's injury. Media sources had pointed the finger of blame at Rooney's Nike football boots, though these accusations were quashed by Ferguson. Swire and his team posited that Rooney's powerful running style may have contributed to the break, but others say that this instance was just bad luck that Michael Duberry happened to land on that particular bone. During his time at Manchester United, Swire has been involved in the development of an \\"injuries database\\" designed to assess each of the club's players' susceptibility to injury, and the causes of the injuries. The data from the database could then be used to fine-tune the players' training regimes and, ultimately, prevent injuries from taking place. Swire announced his retirement on 4 July 2014, with his assistant, Neil Hough, taking over as head physio.

It has seen a lot of warfare because of its location on a major invasion route between South and Central Asia. It is famous for its Sufi shrines. Early history According to Hindu tradition the ancient name of Multan was Kashep Puri and the town was built by Raja Kashep. After Hurnakas his son Parhilaad succeeded the throne and the town was then named after him as Parhilaad Puri. The current name Multan was possibly associated with the Mali people who were defeated by Alexander the Great.Maulana Akber Shah; Aeena- ie-Haqeeqat Nima; Volume 1, pages:82-91 \\"Once Keshap Puri (Multan) was capital of the Raja Hurnakas where Persian Kings had built temple of sun in which idol of sun was laid. After the conquest of Multan one Brahman had poined out Muhammad bin Qasim about treasure hidden beneath the fountain which was buried by Raja Jesubin. Muhammad bin Qasim found 330 chests of treasure containing 13300 maunds gold. Entire treasure was shifted from Debal to Basra on ships. After Islamic conquest, Arab rulers got handsome income from temple of the sun. Whenever any Hindu Raja intended to conquer Multan the Arab rulers would threaten to destroy the temple. Buzrag bin Shahryar wrote the name of temple as Aadith (sun). Al Beruni also wrote same name\\".Rahimdad Khan Molai Shedai; Janat ul Sindh, 3rd edition, 1993, page:64; Sindhi Adbi Board, Jamshoro Multan was ruled by the various native empires before the invasion of Alexander the Great. It is said that when Alexander was fighting for the city, a poisoned arrow struck him, making him ill and eventually leading to his death. The exact place where Alexander was hit by the arrow can be seen in the old city premises. The noted Chinese traveller Huen Tsang visited Multan in 641. Early Muslim era In the 7th century, Multan had its first arrival of the Muslim armies. Armies led by Al Muhallab ibn Abi Suffrah launched numerous raids from Persia into India in 664 for inclusion of the area into their empires. However, only a few decades later, Muhammad bin Qasim would come on behalf of the Arabs, and take Multan along with Sindh. His conquest was accompanied by much plundering: Following bin Qasim's conquest, the city was securely under Muslim rule, although it was in effect an independent state, but around the start of the 11th century, the city was attacked twice by Mahmud of Ghazni who destroyed the Sun Temple and broke its giant Idol. A graphic detail is available in Al-Biruni's writings: During this era, the Multan Sun Temple was noted by the 10th-century Arab geographer Al-Muqaddasi to have been located in a most populous part of the city, between the city's ivory and coppersmith bazaars. The Hindu temple was noted to have accrued the Muslim rulers large tax revenues, by some accounts up to 30% of the state's revenues.from: Multan, 20 March 2017 =Ismailis= By the mid 10th century, Multan had come under the influence of the Qarmatians. The Qarmatians had been expelled from Egypt and Iraq following their defeat at the hands of the Abbasids there. Qarmatians zealots had famously sacked Mecca,Mecca's History, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. and outraged the Muslim world with their theft and ransom of the Kaaba's Black Stone, and desecration of the Zamzam Well with corpses during the Hajj season of 930 CE.Glass√©, Cyril. 2008. The New Encyclopedia of Islam. Walnut Creek CA: AltaMira Press p. 369 They wrested control of the city from the pro-Abbasid Amirate of Banu Munabbih, and established the Amirate of Multan, and pledged allegiance to the Fatimid Dynasty based in Cairo. Jalam bin Shayban, a proselytizing Da'i that had been dispatched to the region by the Fatimid Caliph Imam al-Mu'izz, was dispatched to replace the city's previous Da'i who had been accused of promoting a syncretic version of Islam that incorporated Hindu rites ‚Äì though his replacement was likely the result of doctrinal differences regarding succession in the Ismaili Imamate. Jalam bin Shayban, established newly converted Katara Rajputs as its rulers. Soon after, Multan was attacked by the Ghaznavids, destabilizing the Ismaili state. Mahmud of Ghazna invaded Multan in 1005, conducting a series of campaigns during which some Ismailis were massacred while most later converted to Sunni Hanafi fiqh.Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), p. 100. The city was surrendered, and Abdul Fateh Daud was permitted to retain control over the city with the condition that he adhere to the Sunni interpretation of Islam. Mahmud appointed a Hindu-convert, Nawasa Khan, to rule the region in Mahmud's absentia. After being granted power, Niwasa Khan renounced Islam, and attempted to secure control of the region in collusion with Abdul Fateh Daud. Mahmud of Ghazni then led another expedition to Multan in 1007 C.E. against Niwasa Khan, who was then captured and forced to relinquish his personal fortune to Ghazni. In an effort to gain his allegiance, the Fatimid Ismaili Imam-caliph al-Hakim dispatched an envoy to Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi two years later. This attempt appeared to be unsuccessful and the Ghaznawids continued to attack other Ismaili strongholds in Sindh to suppress any resurgence of the community in the region. In 1032, Mahmud's very own vizier, Hasanak was executed for having accepted a cloak from the Imam-caliph on suspicions that he had become an adherent of the Ismaili fiqh. Mahmud's purges of the region led several scholars including Stern to believe that the Ghaznawid purges of the region drove out Ismailism from the area, however, recently discovered letters dating to 1083 and 1088 demonstrate continued Ismaili activity in the region, as the Imam-caliph Mustansir dispatched new da‚Äôis to replace those who were killed in the attacks. Like his predecessor, Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad of Ghor first took, in 1178, the Ismaili Multan sultans in northern Sindh, which had regained independence from Ghaznavid rule. Muhammad Ghori as a part of his campaigns to conquer north India, again massacred them.History of India and Pakistan: Great Mughals by Muhammad Tariq Awan published by Ferozsons, 1994 After Sultan Muhammad Ghori's victories in India, and his establishment of a capital in Delhi, Multan was made a part of his empire. However, the rise of the Mongols would again give it some independence, albeit requiring it to be vigilant against Mongol raids from Central Asia. The Qarmatians came to Multan in the 10th century and were expelled in 1175 by Sultan Muhammad Ghori.  Mughal era  The Mughals controlled the Punjabi region from 1524 until around 1739. Padshah (emperor) Akbar established at Multan one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level provinces) roughly covering Punjab, bordering Kabul, Lahore, (Old) Delhi, Ajmer, Thatta (Sindh) subahs, the Persian Safavid empire and shortly Qandahar subah. Under the Mughal Empire, Multan enjoyed over 200 years of peace, and became known as Dar al-Aman (Abode of Peace). The Khakwani Nawabs of Multan gave it a lot of financial stability and growth to the local farming sector. It was at this time that Multan was ruled by Nawab Ali Mohammad Khan Khakwani. As governor of Multan, he built the famous Mosque Ali Mohammad Khan in 1757 which remains to this day. Many buildings were constructed in this time, and agricultural production grew rapidly. The Khakwani Nawabs of Multan at this time were paying homage to the Afghan king but due to lack of power in Delhi and Kabul they had free rein and were the de facto absolute rulers of Multan. Multan at that time included areas which are part of Vehari, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan districts. The city escaped the destruction brought upon India by the armies of Nadir Shah. Afterwards it was ruled from Kabul by numerous Afghan dynasties for a while, including by Ahmed Shah Durrani, who, in 1750, appointed a Hindu Subahdar Malik Banwari Lal (Vijh) to administer Multan (and later Shujabaad and Pak Pattan). For the majority of its medieval history, the Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Multan region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Maratha and Sikh invaded and occupied Multan. Maratha Empire In 1758, the Maratha Empire's general Raghunathrao marched onwards, conquered Lahore and Attock and defeated Timur Shah Durrani, the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali. Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the eastern side of Attock were under the Maratha rule for the most part. In Punjab and Kashmir, the Marathas plundered the prosperous Mughal cities. Maratha general Bapuji Trimbak was given the charge of guarding Multan and Dera Ghazi Khan from Afghans. Maratha rule in Multan was short-lived as Durrani re-captured the city in November 1759. Sikh era After Ahmad Shah Durrani's dynasty went into decline, it was ruled locally by the Pashtun Khakwani and Sadduzai chieftains. The Sadozais having gained the favour of the king and having the Khakwani Nawab removed. This period saw the rise of Sikh power, who attacked Multan, killing the Sadozai Nawab, took over the city. The Khakwanis had moved out of the city at that time and lived in small walled cities around main Multan. The Khokhars and Khatri Muslims occupied Multan intermittently between 1756 and 1763 displacing replacing ruling Sadozai member by Khakwani nawab or his brother, son or even son-in- law, this was most turbulent period in history of Multan resulting administration getting paralyzed and inviting attack from Bhangi Misl from Gujranwal. Jhanda Singh Dhillon and Ganda Singh Dhillon two brothers and great warriors attacked again in 1764. However, attempts to take the Multan fort failed and they retreated after collecting several million rupees loot from the ruler Shuja Khan Saddozai. Bhangu Sikhs attacked Multan many times and finally captured the city by defeating Shuja khan Sadozai who was the governor of Multan on 22 Dec 1772. Shuja khan fled to Shujabad and died there. Afghans recaptured the city in 1880 and rule of Bhangi Sikhs ended. The front view of an old colonial building built during the rule of the British Raj. In the 19th century, the Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh with his capital at Lahore occupied Multan. Sikh armies under General Hari Singh Nalwa defeated the ruler of Multan, Muzaffar Khan Saddozai. The death of Muzaffar Khan was in fact the death of Muslim rule in Multan. Ranjit Singh reinstated Malik Mohanlal (Vijh), a descendant of Malik Banwari Lal (Vijh) who was Subahdar of Multan during Ahmed Shah Durrani's rule, as Subahdar, and appointed his younger brother Malik Sewa Ram as a Vakil in Lahore. He also appointed Diwan Sawan Mal Chopra, who was Malik Mohanlal's Munshi or accountant, as the Diwan of Multan. British era =Siege of Multan= The Siege of Multan began on 19 April 1848 when local Sikhs murdered two emissaries of the British Raj who were present at the reception of the new governor of Multan who had been selected by the British East India Company. Rebellion engulfed the Multan region under the leadership of Diwan Mulraj Chopra. The British soon launched expeditions against Mulraj, capturing the nearby town of Dera Ghazi Khan. The British then defeated Mulraj's forces at a settlement 4 miles from Multan on 1 July 1848, and captured most guns belonging to Mulraj's army. General William S. Whish was ordered in July 1848 to take 7,000 men with him into order to capture Multan, where Mulraj had been encircled. Much of the force was Sikhs, who in October 1848 defected to Mulraj's forces, forcing General Whish to abandon his first attempt to conquer Multan. By December 1848, the British had captured portions of Multan city's outskirts. In January 1849, the British had amassed a force of 12,000 to conquer Multan. On 22 January 1849, the British had breached the walls of the Multan Fort, leading to the surrender of Mulraj and his forces to the British. After a long and bloody battle, Multan was made part of the British Raj. During this time, Sardar Karan Narain's son became an icon during the British Raj and was awarded titles 'Rai Bahadur' and Knighted 'Sir' by Her Majesty. The British built some rail routes to the city, but its industrial capacity was never fully developed. Post-independence The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Multan. It initially lacked industry, hospitals and universities. Since then, there has been some industrial growth, and the city's population is continually growing. Today, it is one of the country's largest urban centres and remains an important settlement in the Southern Punjab.

She was built during the First World War and torpedoed and sunk ten days after the UK entered the Second World War. Building Workman, Clark and Company of Belfast built Fanad Head for the Ulster Steam Ship Co Ltd (G. Heyn & Sons Ltd). She was completed in 1917 and registered in Belfast. She was named after Fanad, a headland in County Donegal. Sinking =Initial attacks and response= When the UK entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939 Fanad Head was in Canada. She sailed from Montreal carrying general cargo and grain to the UK, and on 14 September she was steaming unescorted off the coast of Ireland when at 1323 hours she was sighted by the . The U-boat surfaced and gave chase, and Fanad Head radioed for assistance. Some west-northwest of Malin Head U-30 fired a shot across the cargo ship's bow from her 88 mm gun, which persuaded Fanad Heads Master, George Pinkerton, to stop. Pinkerton, his 33 crew and eight passengers abandoned ship in two lifeboats. U-30 took them in tow and put a prize crew aboard her to gather provisions and then scuttle the ship. The distress call reached the aircraft carrier , then on an anti-submarine patrol north-east of Fanad Heads position. Ark Royal quickly launched three Blackburn Skuas of 803 Naval Air Squadron, and detached the destroyers , and to go to Fanad Heads assistance. 30 minutes after launching the first wave of aircraft, Ark Royal herself was attacked by . She succeeded in avoiding the torpedoes and her escorts subsequently sank U-39. After two hours, Ark Royal launched six Swordfish aircraft and detached the F-class destroyers and as reinforcements. =Bombing attempts= When the first Skua reached Fanad Head, the pilots were surprised to find the U-boat surfaced alongside her and dropped the bombs immediately at very low level. The bombs detonated on contact with the water, causing shrapnel to hit the aircraft, damaging it enough to force the pilot to ditch his burning Skua in the sea. Both crewmen survived the crash, but were badly burnt and began swimming towards Fanad Head. Only the pilot managed to reach the ship and was pulled unconscious from the water. U-30 had crash-dived by the stern and avoided damage, but one of its crew had not had time to get below deck before she had submerged, so he too swam to Fanad Head. Meanwhile, the bombs dropped by the Skua had detonated so close to the ship that three men from the prize crew were wounded by shrapnel. Ten minutes after the first attack, the second Skua reached the scene. Its crew sighted what they believed was a U-boat and dropped their bombs, but this was probably the wreck of the first Skua. When U-30 then surfaced nearby they had no bombs left, but repeatedly strafed her with machine gun fire and forced her to dive again. After the aircraft, low on fuel, left to return to Ark Royal, the U-boat re-surfaced and tried to return alongside Fanad Head to take off the prize crew. The third Skua then arrived and sighting U-30, dropped its bombs, but again from an insufficient height. Damage from the explosion caused the Skua to fall into the sea. The pilot managed to get free, and swim to Fanad Head, where he too was taken aboard by the German prize crew. =Torpedoing= U-30 continued to attempt to come alongside, but damaged her bow in her third attempt. She eventually managed to take aboard the five members of the prize crew. The Royal Naval pilots initially remained aboard, but on being told that U-30 intended to torpedo Fanad Head, they jumped overboard and were captured. Shortly afterwards, the first Swordfish arrived and made a strafing run that again forced the U-boat to dive. At 1820 hours U-30 launched a G7a torpedo from one of her stern tubes at Fanad Head from a range of , causing her to sink. U-30 was then repeatedly attacked with bombs from the Swordfishes and depth charges from the two destroyers which had reached the scene. HMS Tartar rescued Fanad Heads passengers and crew and took them to Mallaig, Scotland. U-30 was attacked until 2200 hours, suffering considerable damage, before managing to escape on the surface one hour later. U-30 then made for Reykjav√≠k, reaching there on 19 September. Here the submarine landed one of her seriously injured crewmen and took aboard a replacement from an interned German freighter. U-30 then returned to Germany with the two captured Royal Naval pilots, reaching Wilhelmshaven on 27 September. The pilots spent the rest of the war in a prisoner of war camp in Brunswick.

Francis Goya Foundation for cultural development of children and teenagers from ‚Äúproblem‚Äù regions  Francis Goya Foundation : Art and music for destitute children all over the world.(dead link) Logo Francis Goya Foundation for Childhood Throughout his entire long career as a composer and a musician, Francis Goya has always taken part in charity campaigns aimed at collecting donations for the financing of orphanages and secondary schools in Cambodia, the department of urgent pediatrics of the Queen Fabiola Hospital (l‚ÄôH√¥pital Reine Fabiola) in Belgium, and Saint Michel Oncological Foundation in Brussels. When Francis Goya moved, a long time ago, to Morocco he saw that development of Moroccan young population needs support. A brilliant idea occurred to him when he was traveling over the south regions of the country. He was playing the guitar, with his family around him, at a bivouac near a small village, when suddenly a crowd of children ringed round him and started listening too. The idea was developed further: Francis decided to establish a Foundation for revealing of new talents among children and teenagers from ‚Äúproblem‚Äù regions and helping them develop their musical talents. To establish the Francis Goya Foundation, support has been received from Francis Goya's Moroccan and European friends, who share the same values. The approach consists in arranging free concerts in order to collect funds to buy musical instruments and to finance singing and dancing classes for children. Schools, orphanages, and mountain regions are visited in order to discover young talents who would benefit from serious musical classes and gain and opportunity of studying abroad, and to find those who need long-term control and assistance. ‚ÄúWhen life is generous to us, there comes time to give and time to serve ‚Äì the more so, because music makes hearts warmer. Today is an important day: we are laying the first stone to the base of the edifice, and we would like to use this opportunity to appeal to generosity of the donators for the financing of our ambitious projects, such as donation of musical instruments or taking the charge of conducting artistic classes for children and teenagers from ‚Äúproblem‚Äù regions (such as orphanages, hospitals, douars).

Residual risk is defined in this context as the risk associated with differences between the stochastic inflows of assets into the organization and precedent agents' claims on the organization's cash flows. Precedent agents' claims on an organization's cash flows can consist of e.g. employees' salaries, creditors' interest or the government's taxes.

It is the oldest opera house working in France and one of the oldest in Europe. It is also one of the last possessing its own costume ateliers in France. Construction and architecture In 1732, Duke de Belle-Isle, governor of the Three Bishoprics and benefactor of Metz, decided the urban planning of the Petit-Saulcy island (then used to stock firewoods, and occasionally for horse-fairs), in order built in Metz a modern square in a context of the Enlightenment. The island was drained and the embankments and four bridges were built, connecting the medieval town to the island. The edification of the opera house was conducted by Messin architect Jacques Oger. Adjacent to the opera house, the urban planning included also the construction of the Royal Intendant palace by architect Barth√©lemy Bourdet. The construction of the opera house extended from 1732 to 1752, the War of the Austrian Succession interrupting the works during 8 years. The Tuscany-influenced neo-Classical building is finally inaugurated with a public ball on February 3, 1752. The duke of Belle-Isle described it as \\"one of the most beautiful France's opera-theater\\" at his time, seating 1,382. During the French Revolution, the guillotine for the executions was erected on the parvise of the opera house, the Comedy Square. In 1858, local sculptor Charles P√™tre, then member of the School of Metz artistic movement, adorned its facade with allegories of the Tragedy, the Inspiration, the Lyric Poetry, the Comedy, and the Music. The most recent restoration took place between 1981 and 1982 remodeling the interior of the opera house to improve comfort and sightlines. The performance hall had been reduced to 750 seats in 1963. Performance and cultural policy In the few years after its inauguration it staged several plays from the classic repertoire of the time, including those by Racine, Pierre Corneille, and Moli√®re, whereas towards the end of the ancien regime more contemporary plays by Voltaire, Marivaux, Diderot, and Beaumarchais. As far as opera was concerned, op√©ra comiques by Gr√©try, and Montsigny were staged, as well as operas of Jean-Baptiste Lully. Nineteenth century performances represented the work of both the major dramatists of the era (e.g., Hernani by Victor Hugo appearing just after its Paris premiere) and the major opera composers such as Weber, Vincenzo Bellini, and Donizetti, as well as the grand operas of Meyerbeer, Fromental Hal√©vy, and Daniel Auber. During the season 1894-95, the theatre was presenting 187 events, of which 135 were in French and 52 in German. The Metz Opera-Theater is fused in a unique Lorraine artistic pole with the National Opera of Lorraine. Today, the Opera-Theater features annually around sixty performances, including plays, choreographies, and lyric poetry. Opera-Theater of Metz Metropole on the Comedy square.

Officially, Œπt was semi-autonomous part of the broader National Liberation Front (EAM). In actual fact, it was not controlled by EAM, but directly by the Politburo of the KKE. It can be described as a paramilitary security force. It operated in the cities, and its purpose was the \\"self- defense\\" of the members of the National Liberation Front and its affiliated organizations from the German occupation authorities and the collaborationist government and its organs, the Police, the Gendarmerie (especially its notorious branch named as Special Security, expertised at the anti-communistic struggle) and the Security Battalions. It proved to be very successful in assassinating commanders of the Security Battalions and other armed governmental forces. However, it also became involved in political assassinations of political opponents of the then-Stalinist KKE on both ends of the political spectrum, such as Trotskyites and Archeio-Marxists. As a result, the activities of the OPLA are a subject of heated debate even today. In April 1944 it was renamed as National Civil Guard, though members of OPLA continued operations. The organization was also active during the December 1944 events in Athens. Hundreds of executions of anti-communists or collaborators took place in the vicinity of the ULEN refineries. Among its victims was also the well-known actress Eleni Papadaki. During the subsequent Greek Civil War, it was renamed as People's Civil Guard. It acted especially in Thessaloniki and Northern Greece in 1946-1947 (in these regions the name of the organization was Close Self-Defense, Œ£œÑŒµŒΩŒÆ ŒëœÖœÑŒøŒ¨ŒºœÖŒΩŒ± in Greek). One of its more notable later actions was the assassination of Justice Minister Christos Ladas (who had signed the execution of hundreds of communists) in Athens on 1 May 1948, by OPLA and KKE member Efstratios (Stratos) Moutsogiannis. In Macedonia and Epirus during the Civil War, the OPLA assassinated many high- ranking officers of the Greek Gendarmerie. During the Greek Civil War, OPLA turned the monastery of St. George in Feneos into a concentration camp and killing ground for those they deemed \\"reactionaries\\". The concentration camp was well-organized for mass killings, with 6-7 resident killers that worked round the clock in busy times. It is believed that hundreds were killed.

There are two types of R&D; intensity: direct and indirect. R&D; intensity varies, in general, according to a firm's industry sector, product knowledge, manufacturing, and technology, and is a metric that can be used to gauge the level of a company's investment to spur innovation in and through basic and applied research. A further aim of R&D; spending, ultimately, is to increase productivity (e.g., factor productivity) as well as an organization's salable output. Definition and aim of metric Generally speaking, R&D; is seen as a main driver of societal and business innovation. The OECD's Frascati Manual describes R&D; as \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\"OECD (2002) Frascati Manual 2002: Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys on Research and Experimental Development, The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities, p. 30, Paris, FR: OECD Publishing, DOI 10.1787/9789264199040-en, see , accessed 13 October 2015. R&D; expenditure and R&D; intensity are two of the key indicators used to monitor resources devoted to science and technology worldwide. R&D; intensity has been defined as \\"the ratio of expenditures by a firm on research and development to the firm's sales.\\" William Leonard has described research intensity as \\"measured usually by ratios of scientific personnel to total employment or by R&D; expenditures/sales\\" to gains in such variables as productivity, profits, sales, and asset status. R&D; intensity is therefore a measure of a company's R&D; spending toward activities aimed at expanding sector and product knowledge, manufacturing, and technology, and so aimed at spurring innovation in and through basic and applied research. Furthermore, it is aimed at increasing \\"factor productivity and salable output\\". There are two types of R&D; intensity, calculated as follows: * Direct R&D; intensity, calculated by dividing R&D; expenditure by output * Indirect R&D; intensity, which quantifies the R&D; expenditure embodied in the intermediate goods used in the production of another sector and can be calculated using Input-Output Tables In enterprises and companies As the National Science Foundation explains: absolute levels of \\"R&D; expenditures indicate the level of effort dedicated to producing future products and process improvements while maintaining current market share and increasing operating efficiency. By extension, such expenditures may reflect firms' perceptions of the market's demand for new and improved technology.\\" However, R&D; intensity is the most frequently used measure \\"to gauge the relative importance of R&D; across industries and among firms in the same industry.\\" Economic research on sixteen industries by William Leonard, \\"the relation [between investment and gains] appears two years after R&D; spending and increases thereafter\\", although research intensity relates \\"less effectively\\" to \\"manpower ratios [ratios of scientific personnel to total employment].\\" Among sectors R&D; intensity differs between different sectors: high-tech sectors (such as aircraft & spacecraft, electrical equipment, and pharmaceuticals) are characterized by the highest R&D; intensity, while low-tech sectors (such as food products, iron and steel, and textiles) usually have low R&D; intensity. In fact, R&D; intensity could be used as the sole indicator to identify high-tech sectors. By countries and regions R&D; intensity for a country or larger political or geographical entity is defined as its R&D; expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) of the entity. Generally speaking, developed countries have higher R&D; intensities than developing countries. As Eurostat noted in 2013, for a preceding period, GERD can be broken down among four sectors of performance: business enterprise, higher education, government, and private not-for-profit institutions serving households (PNP).OECD (2013). \\"2.

It can be formed from liquid water above 3 GPa (30,000 atmospheres) by lowering its temperature to room temperature, or by decompressing heavy water (D2O) ice VI below 95 K. Ordinary water ice is known as ice Ih, (in the Bridgman nomenclature). Different types of ice, from ice II to ice XVIII, have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures. Ice VII is metastable over a wide range of temperatures and pressures and transforms into low-density amorphous ice (LDA) above .S. Klotz, J. M. Besson, G. Hamel, R. J. Nelmes, J. S. Loveday and W. G. Marshall, Metastable ice VII at low temperature and ambient pressure, Nature 398 (1999) 681‚Äì684. Ice VII has a triple point with liquid water and ice VI at 355 K and 2.216 GPa, with the melt line extending to at least and 10 GPa. Ice VII can be formed within nanoseconds by rapid compression via shock- waves. It can also be created by increasing the pressure on ice VI at ambient temperature. Like the majority of ice phases (including ice Ih), the hydrogen atom positions are disordered.. In addition, the oxygen atoms are disordered over multiple sites.... The structure of ice VII comprises a hydrogen bond framework in the form of two interpenetrating (but non-bonded) sublattices. Hydrogen bonds pass through the center of the water hexamers and thus do not connect the two lattices. Ice VII has a density of about 1.65 g cm‚àí3 (at 2.5 GPa and ),D. Eisenberg and W. Kauzmann, The structure and properties of water (Oxford University Press, London, 1969); (b) The dodecahedral interstitial model is described in L. Pauling, The structure of water, In Hydrogen bonding, Ed. D. Hadzi and H. W. Thompson (Pergamon Press Ltd, London, 1959) pp 1‚Äì6. which is less than twice the cubic ice density as the intra-network O‚ÄìO distances are 8% longer (at 0.1 MPa) to allow for interpenetration. The cubic unit cell has a side length of 3.3501 √Ö (for D2O, at 2.6 GPa and ) and contains two water molecules. Ice VII is the only disordered phase of ice that can be ordered by simple cooling,Note: ice Ih theoretically transforms into proton-ordered ice XI on geologic timescales, but in practice it is necessary to add small amounts of KOH catalyst. and it forms (ordered) ice VIII below 273 K up to ~8 GPa. Above this pressure, the VII‚ÄìVIII transition temperature drops rapidly, reaching 0 K at ~60 GPa.. Thus, ice VII has the largest stability field of all of the molecular phases of ice. The cubic oxygen sub- lattices that form the backbone of the ice VII structure persist to pressures of at least 128 GPa;. this pressure is substantially higher than that at which water loses its molecular character entirely, forming ice X. In high pressure ices, protonic diffusion (movement of protons around the oxygen lattice) dominates molecular diffusion, an effect which has been measured directly. Natural occurrence Scientists hypothesize that ice VII may comprise the ocean floor of Europa as well as extrasolar planets (such as Gliese 436 b, and Gliese 1214 b) that are largely made of water.University of Li√®ge (2007, May 16). Astronomers Detect Shadow Of Water World In Front Of Nearby Star. ScienceDaily. Retrieved Jan. 3, 2010, from In 2018, ice VII was identified among inclusions found in natural diamonds. Due to this demonstration that ice VII exists in nature, the International Mineralogical Association duly classified ice VII as a distinct mineral. The ice VII was presumably formed when water trapped inside the diamonds retained the high pressure of the deep mantle due to the strength and rigidity of the diamond lattice, but cooled down to surface temperatures, producing the required environment of high pressure without high temperature.

History The name honors James Miller, an Irishman who settled on part of Rancho San Pedro, Santa Margarita y Las Gallinas in 1845. Watershed and Course The Miller Creek watershed drains . Miller Creek originates on Big Rock Ridge southwest of the city of Novato. It descends southward to Lucas Valley Road, where it turns eastward into Gallinas Valley, paralleling the road to Miller Creek Road. There it crosses Lucas Valley Road and jogs northward through Marinwood Park before turning east again along the southern edge of Marinwood. It crosses under U.S. Route 101 at milepost 15.35 and flows through channels in McInnes County Park to empty into the west end of San Pablo Bay. Ecology In recent years, steelhead trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) of multiple ages have been identified in Miller Creek. It has been identified by EPA, Marin County Public Works and California Department of Fish and Game for restoration potential for trout because it has high quality connected riparian habitat, minimal barriers to fish passage and no reservoirs. Habitat and pollution The California Coastal Commission considers Miller Creek a Critical Coastal Area because it is an impaired water body (listed under Section 303(d) of the U.S. Clean Water Act) which adjoins the San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Livestock have grazed on the watershed since the 1800s, causing widening and downcutting of the creek. It continues to carry a heavy load of sediment from grazing activity, and its lower reaches are also impacted by suburban development.

It is located in Tel Aviv. History The authority was set up on July 1, 1961, under the Ports Authority Law 5721-1961. On July 26, 1988, the Knesset approved an amendment to the Ports Authority Law, merging Israel Railways into the Authority, henceforth to be known as the Israel Ports and Railways Authority. In 2002, Israel Railways was turned into a new state company and separated from the Ports Authority. Responsibilities The duties are to plan, construct, develop, manage, maintain, and operate the ports. The Ports Authority law defines the Authority as a government corporation competent to acquire all rights, make all undertakings, and act as a litigant in all legal proceedings and a party to all contracts. It also stipulates that the Authority must run the ports as commercially viable enterprises and specifies those matters that require Government approval - development budgets, changes in tariffs, etc. Governance The Ports Authority Council is appointed by the Government on recommendation of the Transport Minister. Of its 17 members, ten represent the public, and seven represent government ministries.Israel Ports and Railways Authority Since 2011, former Mossad chief Meir Dagan is the current Director of the Israel Port Authority. Dagan died of cancer on 17 March 2016 at the age of 71. Competition and privatization In the beginning of the 21st century, the government of Israel instructed the Ports Authority to take steps aimed at increasing competition in the seaports field in the country. As part of this effort, Israel Shipyards was granted a permit to operate a small private port on its premises near the Port of Haifa, and the operation of each public port was handed to newly-created state companies in hopes increasing competition between Ashdod and Haifa ports. Unfortunately, not enough of the desired competitive outcome was achieved due to the oligopolistic market position, historical labor union obligations, and limited capacity of the two existing major ports. As a result of this situation, in the middle of the 2010s, the Ports Authority embarked on a NIS7.5 billion (appx. US$2 billion) investment program to construct large new shipping terminals at both Haifa and Ashdod ports and held a bid for private companies to operate the new terminals for a period of 25 years beginning in the year 2021. Shanghai International Port Group (SPIG) won the tender to operate the Bay Terminal in Haifa, while Switzerland-based Terminal Investment Limited (also known as the TiL Group, controlled by the privately held MSC Group) won the tender to operate the Southern Terminal in Ashdod once the terminals‚Äô construction is complete.

Sandusky served as an assistant coach for his entire career, mostly at Pennsylvania State University under Joe Paterno, from 1969 to 1999. He received \\"Assistant Coach of the Year\\" awards in 1986 and 1999. Sandusky authored several books related to his football coaching experiences. In 1977, Sandusky founded The Second Mile, a non-profit charity serving Pennsylvania's underprivileged and at-risk youth. After Sandusky's 1999 retirement as assistant coach at Penn State, he continued working with The Second Mile at Penn State, maintaining an office at the university until 2011. In 2011, following a two-year grand jury investigation, Sandusky was arrested and charged with 52 counts of sexual abuse of young boys over a 15-year period from 1994 to 2009. He met his molestation victims through The Second Mile; they were participating in the organization. Several of them testified against Sandusky in his sexual abuse trial. Four of the charges were subsequently dropped. On June 22, 2012, Sandusky was found guilty on 45 of the 48 remaining charges. Sandusky was sentenced on October 9, 2012, to 30 to 60 years in prison. On October 18, 2012, Sandusky's lawyers appealed his conviction in Centre County Court in Pennsylvania. They claim that they did not have enough time to prepare for their client's case. On October 31, 2012, Sandusky was moved to Pennsylvania's SCI Greene \\"supermax\\" prison to serve his sentence. On January 30, 2013, Pennsylvania Judge John Cleland denied Sandusky's request for a new trial. Early life and family Sandusky was born in Washington, Pennsylvania, in 1944,Hyman, J., 2006, Game of My Life Penn State: Memorable Stories of Nittany Lion Football, Sports Publishing the only son of Evelyn Mae (n√©e Lee), an Irish Catholic homemaker who came from a small Pennsylvania coal-mining town, and Arthur Sandusky, whose parents, Edward and Josephine Sendecki, were immigrants from Poland, who moved to East Vandergrift, Pennsylvania. His father Arthur served in the field of youth service programs for over 30 years, mostly as director of the Brownson House in Washington, Pennsylvania, a community recreation center for children. There, he founded the Pennsylvania Junior Wrestling program and created junior basketball, volleyball, boxing and football programs for the Brownson House. He improved the facilities there by adding a new playground, gym, outdoor basketball court, and a renovated football field. He managed the 1955 Washington baseball team that won the Pony League World Series championship, the only team from Washington to win that championship. Arthur was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1989. At home, Jerry Sandusky adopted his own personal code called \\"Jer's Law\\" that he observed for many years. The rules adopted were that Sandusky could be mischievous but not to the point where someone could be intentionally hurt; he also vowed to not be disrespectful to his teachers; and he swore to himself that he would tell the truth if he was caught breaking any rules. Sandusky is a fan of the 1994 film Forrest Gump, confiding to one of his victims that he identifies with the lead character. Sandusky signed off at least one of his letters to his victim as \\"Forrest Jer.\\" Sandusky attended Washington High School, where he was a good student and standout athlete, playing baseball, basketball, and football. He was a leader on his junior high basketball team that went undefeated through the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League playoffs in his final season there. His classmates have described him as a studious \\"loner\\" who \\"never dated in high school\\" but was a popular and handsome athlete. Sandusky married Dorothy \\"Dottie\\" (n√©e Gross) in 1966, and together they have six adopted children. Sandusky and his wife have also served as foster parents. One of Sandusky's sons, Jon Sandusky, was Director of Player Personnel for the Cleveland Browns from 2010 to 2014. Another son, E. J. Sandusky, is an assistant football coach at West Chester University. Sandusky described his family as \\"old fashioned\\" with Dottie being the leader. Matt Sandusky, adopted son and former foster child of Sandusky's, released a statement through his attorneys saying that Sandusky had sexually molested him as a child. Matt Sandusky's statement was released on the day the jury began deliberations in the sex abuse trial against Sandusky. On February 13, 2017, Sandusky's son Jeffrey (Jeff) was arrested and charged with sexual assault of a child and possession of child pornography, and entered a plea deal while awaiting trial in September 2017, with sentencing scheduled for December 2017. On December 8, 2017, he was given a sentence of three-and-a-half to six years in prison after \\"pleading guilty to pressuring a teenage girl to send him naked photos and asking her teen sister to perform a sex act.\\" Jerry Sandusky was a member of St. Paul's United Methodist Church in State College. Education and football career Sandusky played for Rip Engle at Penn State, starting at defensive end from 1963 to 1965. He graduated first in his class with a B.S. in health in 1966 and physical education in 1970. =Early coaching career= Sandusky served as a graduate assistant under Paterno at Penn State in 1966. He was the assistant basketball and track coach at Juniata College in 1967 and the offensive line coach at Boston University in 1968. =Coaching career at Penn State= He returned to Penn State in 1969 and remained there as an assistant coach until his retirement at the end of the 1999 season. Sandusky served as defensive line coach in 1969, became linebacker coach in 1970, and was promoted to defensive coordinator in 1977, holding that position until his retirement. In his years as a linebacker coach and defensive coordinator, he coached many defensive squads, and Penn State gained a reputation for outstanding linebacker play, producing 10 first-team All-Americans at that position, and acquiring the nickname \\"Linebacker U\\". Jack Ham and LaVar Arrington were two of the noted pro football greats to emerge from his teams. Upon his retirement, Sandusky was awarded \\"both an unusual compensation package and a special designation of 'emeritus' rank that carried special privileges, including access to the university's recreational facilities.\\" Spanier approved a lump-sum payment to Sandusky of $168,000. His final game coaching at Penn State was a notable game for Sandusky. Penn State faced Texas A&M; in the 1999 Alamo Bowl in San Antonio, Texas. The Nittany Lions' defense shut out Texas A&M;, 24‚Äì0, the only bowl game shutout victory for Penn State under Paterno. The Second Mile After retirement, Sandusky hosted many summer football camps and was active in The Second Mile, a children's charity he founded in State College, Pennsylvania, in 1977.

The charges were initiated at Central Mountain High School, where a student made allegations of abuse against Sandusky.\\"Jerry Sandusky alleged Victim 1 graduates after being bullied out of school, is ready to testify\\" Sunday, June 10, 2012, 11:25 AM By SARA GANIM, The Patriot-News The investigation reached a new level of urgency when it became apparent that the allegations were not an isolated set of incidents, but that Sandusky had a strategy to abuse vulnerable boys. Through his Second Mile organization, Sandusky would first approach potential victims, typically boys without a father living at home, when they were 8‚Äì12 years old; subsequently, Sandusky employed classic child grooming strategies such as offering trips to football games or bestowing gifts, which would lead to incremental touching. This form of manipulation is generally the modus operandi of pedophiles as a ploy to build trust while invading personal boundaries ‚Äî all part of instilling confusion, leading up to and part of the sexual abuse. Eventually, Sandusky often initiated overtly sexual behavior in the locker room showers. \\"The testimony of one victim, who said he was forced to play with Sandusky's testicles and erect penis when he was 8 to 10 years old, particularly outraged investigators. 'The poor kid was too young to even understand what an erect penis means,' one said.\\" On November 4, 2011, a grand jury that had been convened in September 2009, or earlier, indicted Sandusky on 40 counts of sex crimes against young boys. The indictment came after a three-year investigation that explored allegations of Sandusky having inappropriate contact with an underage boy over the course of four years, beginning when the boy was ten years old. The boy's parents reported the incident to police in 2009. The grand jury identified eight boys who had been singled out for sexual advances or sexual assaults by Sandusky, taking place from 1994 through 2009. At least 20 of the incidents allegedly took place while Sandusky was still employed at Penn State.Juliano, Joe. Two Penn State officials charged in connection with sex-abuse investigation. The Philadelphia Inquirer, November 6, 2011. According to the first indictment, in 2002 assistant coach Mike McQueary, then a Penn State graduate assistant, said he walked in on Sandusky anally raping a ten-year-old boy. The next day, McQueary reported the incident to head coach Joe Paterno. (Later while testifying during the Sandusky trial, McQueary spoke about what he had relayed to Paterno: \\"I told him and I want to make sure I'm clear. I made sure he knew it was sexual and wrong. There was no doubt.\\") Paterno told McQueary at the time, \\"You did what you had to do. It is my job now to figure out what we want to do.\\" At the Preliminary Hearing for Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, McQueary testified that Paterno was \\"shocked and saddened, kind of slumped back on his chair.\\" He said that Paterno told him: \\"'I'm sorry you had to see that. It's terrible.' And he said, 'I need to think and tell some people about what you saw and I'll let you know what ... what we'll do next.'\\" Paterno then informed Penn State athletic director Tim Curley. At the Preliminary Hearing, McQueary also testified that he \\"believed\\" Sandusky was having \\"some type of intercourse\\" with the boy. He said that this was based on \\"the positioning\\" of Sandusky and the boy, but that he never saw \\"insertion\\" or \\"penetration\\" and is not \\"100 percent sure\\" that intercourse was occurring.Transcript of Proceedings, Preliminary Hearing, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Timothy Mark Curley and Gary Charles Shultz, pp. 13, 14 Curley and senior vice president for finance and business Gary Schultz (who oversaw the Penn State police department) called McQueary to a meeting a week and a half later. In McQueary's testimony he stated that during the meeting he relayed in \\"graphic detail\\" what he had witnessed in the locker-room showers at the Lasch Building. At the Preliminary Hearing of Curley and Schultz, McQueary testified that he would have given Curley and Schultz a \\"rough idea\\" of the body positions of the individuals in the shower, and would have described the activity as \\"extremely sexual and I thought some kind of intercourse was going on.\\"Transcript of Proceedings, Preliminary Hearing, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Timothy Mark Curley and Gary Charles Shultz, pp. 35, 36 The indictment accused Curley and Schultz not only of failing to tell the police, but also of falsely telling the grand jury that McQueary never informed them of the alleged sexual activity.Wetzel, Dan. State's insufficient action amid child sex allegations stunning Yahoo Sports, November 5, 2011 On November 5, 2011, Sandusky was arrested and charged with seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, eight counts of corruption of minors, eight counts of endangering the welfare of a child, seven counts of indecent assault, and other offenses. The prosecution charged Curley and Schultz with perjury and failure to report suspected child abuse by Sandusky. On November 6, 2011, Penn State banned Sandusky from campus.State to pay AD's legal costs. ESPN, November 6, 2011. His bail conditions did not include restrictions on his travel.On November 10, 2011, the Sandusky home, which is located next to an elementary school and playground, was vandalized. see Sandusky's House, Next to Playground, Vandalized (NBC, November 11, 2011) In December 2011, Sandusky was charged with an additional 12 counts of sexual crimes against children. The grand jury's second presentment charged Sandusky with an additional count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and two additional counts of unlawful contact with a minor. The additional victims, known only as \\"Victim 9\\" and \\"Victim 10,\\" were participants in Sandusky's youth program and were between the ages of 10 and 12 at the time of the sexual assaults. On December 7, 2011, Sandusky was arrested for a second time based on the additional sexual abuse charges. Sandusky was released on $250,000 bail and placed on monitored house arrest while he awaited trial. Sandusky chose to waive his preliminary hearing that took place in mid-December. =Pre-trial interviews= On November 14, in a televised phone interview on NBC's Rock Center with Brian Williams, Sandusky admitted to correspondent Bob Costas to having showered with underage boys and touching their bodies, as he described it \\"without intent of sexual contact.\\" Sandusky denied being a pedophile. The interview received substantial coverage in the media, particularly regarding the manner in which Sandusky answered Costas when asked if he is sexually attracted to young boys: In the days following the interview, several potential victims contacted State College lawyer Andy Shubin to tell their stories, with one claiming Sandusky had abused him in the 1970s. In a taped interview with Jo Becker of The New York Times on December 3, 2011, Sandusky and his lawyer, Joe Amendola, attempted to clarify the remarks he made in the November 14 interview: During the same interview, Sandusky responded to the initial 40 charges of sexual crimes against children: =Trial= The trial, for 52 charges of sexual crimes against children, started on June 11, 2012, at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. State Deputy Attorney General and former homicide prosecutor Joseph E. McGettigan III, led the prosecution team for the Commonwealth; defense attorney Joseph Amendola was Sandusky's lead attorney for the defense team; and Senior Judge John Cleland presided. Over the course of the trial that lasted eight days, jurors heard from eight witnesses who testified that Sandusky sexually abused them. Jurors also heard testimony about assaults on two other victims who were never identified. Of the eight males who gave testimony, each explained that they met Sandusky through The Second Mile organization; their individual accounts spanned from the mid-1990s until 2009. The witnesses testified of similar stories of being abused in the football locker room showers or in the basement of Sandusky's home. The first prosecution witness, identified in media reports as \\"Victim 4,\\" described detailed accounts of many instances of sexual abuse, including unwanted oral and anal sex, by Sandusky while the witness was a participant in Sandusky's Second Mile charitable organization. According to \\"Victim 4,\\" he was sexually abused by Sandusky as many as three times a week for three years, beginning when he was 13 years old. The witness further testified that when he attempted to distance himself from Sandusky, Sandusky offered the boy a contract for money to continue spending time with him. On the second day of trial, \\"Victim 1\\", the youngest of Sandusky's alleged victims, testified to over 20 incidents of abuse, including forced oral sex, by Sandusky during 2007 and 2008 while the boy was a participant in Sandusky's Second Mile program. The boy was 11 or 12 years old when the sexual abuse started. Mike McQueary, former Penn State graduate assistant football coach, testified that in 2001 in a Penn State locker room, he heard \\"skin on skin\\" slapping sounds coming from the showers. McQueary testified that he then saw Sandusky naked behind a 10- to 12-year-old boy propped against a shower wall, with \\"Sandusky's arms wrapped around the boy's midsection in the closest proximity that I think you could be in.\\" Sandusky's defense attorneys argued that the accusers were driven by financial motives. The defense also pointed out some of the accusers had changed their stories and that some of them continued a relationship with Sandusky after the alleged abuse (one went to a football game with Sandusky shortly before his arrest, another brought his girlfriend to meet Sandusky). A psychiatrist testifying for the defense, Dr. Eliot Atkins, diagnosed Sandusky with histrionic personality disorder, a disorder characterized by attention seeking behavior and exaggerated emotions. Dr. Atkins testified that the letters written by Sandusky to the accusers were consistent with this disorder, rather than \\"grooming\\" behavior as alleged by the prosecution. On June 18, 2012, it was reported that during the full-day court recess the previous Friday, prosecutors had contacted NBC \\"asking the network to re-authenticate a full unedited transcript\\" of the Bob Costas interview from November. An unaired portion of the Costas interview featured Sandusky saying, \\"I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped\\". JavaScript needs to be disabled to view this page. Legal analysts explained that this could be used by the prosecution to cross- examine Sandusky if he were to take the stand. On June 21, 2012, after the case had gone to the jury, Matt Sandusky, one of Sandusky's six adopted children, stated through his attorney that he was also a victim of the former coach's sexual abuse. He had been ready to testify for the prosecution, but did not do so. Later, Amendola said that Jerry Sandusky had every intention of testifying in his own defense, but decided against it because he claimed that the prosecution would have called Matt Sandusky to the stand. Subsequently, sources close to the investigation conducted by the Office of the State attorney general have stated that the prosecutor never threatened to have Matt Sandusky testify at trial, and that \\"prosecutor Joseph McGettigan relished the opportunity of taking-on Jerry Sandusky in cross examination and had promised Amendola early on that they would not call any additional rebuttal witnesses\\". =Verdict and sentencing= The jury, consisting of seven women and five men, many with direct ties to Penn State, deliberated for 21 hours over two days. On the evening of June 22, 2012, the jury reached its verdict, finding Sandusky guilty on 45 of the 48 counts against him. Specifically, Sandusky was convicted of the following charges and counts: eight counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, seven counts of indecent assault, one count of criminal intent to commit indecent assault, nine counts of unlawful contact with minors, 10 counts of corruption of minors and 10 counts of endangering the welfare of children. Cleland immediately revoked Sandusky's bail and remanded him to the Centre County Correctional Facility to await sentencing. Sandusky faced a maximum sentence of 442 years in prison. According to NBC News' Michael Isikoff, Sandusky faced a minimum sentence of 60 years under Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines ‚Äî at his age, effectively a life sentence. A sentencing hearing was expected 90 days from the date of conviction. On September 17, it was announced that Sandusky would be sentenced on October 9.Jerry Sandusky hearing set for Oct. 9. ESPN, September 17, 2012. Sandusky's statement the evening before his sentencing On the evening before his sentencing hearing, Sandusky released an audio statement maintaining his innocence. The next day, Cleland sentenced Sandusky to 60 years in prison‚Äìas mentioned above, the minimum possible sentence under Pennsylvania law. He will not be eligible for parole until he serves at least 30 years. His earliest possible release date will be October 9, 2042; when he will be 98 years old‚Äìvirtually assuring that he will die in prison. In pronouncing the sentence, Cleland said that Sandusky was a particularly dangerous breed of child molester because he masked his manipulation and abuse of children behind a respectable facade. \\"It is the remarkable ability to conceal that makes these crimes so heinous,\\" he said. While acknowledging Sandusky's \\"positive work,\\" Cleland called him a \\"dangerous\\" child molester who should never be allowed to be free again. At the same hearing, Cleland granted prosecutors' request to have Sandusky declared a \\"sexually violent predator\\" under Pennsylvania's version of Megan's Law. This would subject him to stringent reporting requirements if he is released. Sandusky would not only have to report his address to police every three months for the rest of his life, but would also have to participate in a court-approved counseling program; however, this designation will likely be academic since as mentioned above, Sandusky will almost certainly die in prison.Lawyers want Jerry Sandusky hearing. ESPN, September 12, 2012. Earlier, on August 30, the Pennsylvania Sexual Offenders Assessment Board had recommended that Sandusky be declared a sexually violent predator. Sandusky could also potentially face federal charges for molesting boys at both the 1999 Outback Bowl in Tampa and his final game as a collegiate coach, the 1999 Alamo Bowl in San Antonio. Although these were spelled out in the state indictment, federal authorities have jurisdiction over any crime that crosses a state line. Although federal investigators appear to be focusing their probe on a possible cover-up of Sandusky's crimes by officials at Penn State, it would not be double jeopardy to bring charges against Sandusky himself. Officials in San Antonio are conducting a probe of the 1999 Alamo Bowl case, and Sandusky could potentially face charges there; again, it would not be double jeopardy for him to be charged in Texas.Penn State Sex Abuse Scandal Spreads to Texas for Alleged Alamo Bowl Tryst. ABC News, November 11, 2011. =Reaction= Penn State became the subject of significant media criticism because several members of its staff, ranging from the university's president down to a graduate assistant, covered up Sandusky's assaults. Maureen Dowd wrote of the scandal: \\"Like the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy, the Penn State hierarchy appears to have covered up pedophile crimes to protect its brand.\\" In June 2012, Penn State University implemented a policy to require mandatory reporting of child abuse by any Penn State employee working with children. The policy also requires all Penn State employees working with children to go through a background check and training related to child abuse and reporting requirements. =Freeh report= The Penn State Board of Trustees commissioned a report by a special investigative group headed by former FBI director Louis Freeh. After interviewing over 400 people and reviewing over 3.5 million documents, the crux of the report's findings, which were released July 12, 2012, state: The Freeh Report states that although the \\"avoidance of the consequences of bad publicity\\" was the main driver in failing to protect child abuse victims and report to authorities, the report outlines other causes as well, among which were: \\"A striking lack of empathy for child abuse victims by the most senior leaders of the University\\"; a failure of oversight by the Board of Trustees; a University President \\"who discouraged discussion and dissent\\"; \\"a lack of awareness of child abuse issues\\"; and \\"a culture of reverence for the football program that is ingrained at all levels of the campus community\\". The report outlines how all four men were aware of the 1998 abuse incident in the locker-room shower, and had followed its investigation at the time. Freeh's investigation uncovered a file kept by Schultz in which he wrote notes about Sandusky's 1998 incident. For instance, Schultz wrote: \\"Is this opening of Pandora's box?\\" He also wondered, \\"other children?\\" Freeh stated that Schultz had \\"actively sought to conceal those records\\".Comments by Freeh at press conference after delivering prepared remarks ‚Äî July 12, 2012 The evidentiary weight of Freeh's report draws heavily upon retrieved emails from 1998 and 2001, which Freeh referred to as \\"the most important evidence\\" in the report. The report asserts that these emails demonstrate that in 1998 Paterno knew of the investigation of Sandusky, and followed it closely; and suggest that it was Paterno, \\"long regarded as the single most powerful official at the university,\\" who persuaded Spanier, Curley, and Schultz not to formally report Sandusky to law enforcement or child welfare authorities. According to The New York Times, the university's handling of the 2001 report of Sandusky raping a young boy is \\"one of the most damning episodes laid out by Mr. Freeh's investigation ...\\" The report states that nobody took any \\"responsible action after February 2001 other than Curley informing the Second Mile that Mr. Sandusky had showered with a boy\\"The report states on page 24: that after the meeting with Curley, the \\"Second Mile leadership\\" concluded that the matter was \\" a non-incident\\" that did not require \\"further action\\". and then telling Sandusky not to bring his \\"guests\\" into the Penn State facilities; but the topic of sexual abuse was not broached with Sandusky. The report criticizes Paterno for his failure to \\"alert the entire football staff, in order to prevent Sandusky from bringing another child into the Lasch Building\\". According to details in the report, despite being aware of Sandusky's sexual misconduct with young boys in the locker-room showers in the Lasch Building in 1998, and 2001, Spanier, Paterno, Curley, and Schultz never restricted Sandusky's access to Penn State facilities. The report states that Sandusky had access to the Lasch Building until November 2011. Over the next ten-year period, Sandusky \\"was frequently at the Lasch Building working out, showing up at campus events that Penn State supported ... He was showering with young boys, staying in dormitories ... There are more red flags than you could count, over a long period of time.\\" Consequently, out of the 10 young boys that Sandusky would be convicted of sexually assaulting, most of them were abused after he was investigated in 1998Various media sources give different numbers: The New York Times : Sandusky \\"was convicted of sexually attacking 10 young boys, nine of them after the 1998 investigation\\"; The Patriot-News : \\"In fact, seven of the 10 boys Sandusky molested were abused after 1999\\"; ESPN : \\"The report makes clear that the consequences of the inaction in 1998 and again in 2001 allowed Sandusky to sexually assault four more boys in the subsequent years\\"; and another ESPN writer : \\"Paterno's cowardice and ego and fears allowed Sandusky to molest at least eight more boys in the years after that 1998 incident\\". ‚Äî at least five of them were assaulted \\"at Penn State's football facilities and other places on campus after May 1998\\". After his retirement in 1999, the report notes that Sandusky continued to have \\"unrestricted and unsupervised access to the University's facilities and affiliation with the university's prominent football program. Indeed, the continued access provided Sandusky with the very currency that enabled him to attract his victims\\". Beyond the question of building access, the report details that as part of Sandusky's retirement agreement he could \\"continue to work with young people through Penn State\\" for more than a decade, including Second Mile events on campus, youth football camps, etc. At the July 12 press conference announcing the report's findings, Freeh stated in his prepared remarks: \\"The most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children Sandusky victimized.\\" He said they \\"never demonstrated, through actions or words, any concern for the safety and well-being of Sandusky's victims\\" until after he was arrested in 2011. =Further allegations and investigations= Three men came forward and told police that they were abused in the 1970s or 1980s by Sandusky. They are the first men to allege abuse before the 1990s. CBS News also reported that the United States Postal Service is leading an investigation to see whether Sandusky sent child pornography through the mail across state lines. According to one source, child pornography was found on at least one of Sandusky's computers. Other reports indicated that individuals had come forward claiming that Sandusky had assaulted them during the 1960s, while he was living at the Brownson House in Washington, Pennsylvania. On August 24, 2012, as reported by the Associated Press, the individual known as \\"Victim 1\\" who testified at the trial of Sandusky brought suit against Pennsylvania State University. They reported that the suit charged the university's conduct with regard to the complaints that Sandusky had acted towards boys with sexual impropriety was \\"deliberate and shameful\\", saying that Penn State engaged in \\"purposeful, deliberate and shameful subordination of the safety of children to its economic self-interests, and to its interest in maintaining and perpetuating its reputation.\\" In September 2012, former Philadelphia child prostitute Greg Bucceroni alleged that in 1979 and 1980 Philadelphia philanthropist Ed Savitz brought him from his New Jersey residence to State College Second Mile fund raiser for the purpose of child trafficking. =Imprisonment= On October 23, 2012, Sandusky was transferred to Camp Hill state prison in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, for pre-imprisonment evaluation. He was then moved to Greene state prison in Franklin Township, where most of the state's life and capital inmates are housed, on October 31, 2012, to serve his sentence. He was housed in protective custody. On December 3, 2014, KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh reported that Sandusky received a letter from Penn State asking to renew his season ticket plan for the football team and attend a \\"recruiting\\" trip to a Penn State basketball game. The letter was reportedly sent out in error.Penn State Reportedly Sends Jerry Sandusky Letter To Renew Season Tickets KDKA-TV (12/03/2014) Sandusky was transferred to SCI Somerset, a medium-security prison outside Somerset, Pennsylvania, in March 2017. As of May 2017, he is currently serving his sentence at SCI Laurel Highlands, a minimum security facility near Pittsburgh that primarily serves ill or elderly inmates. Sandusky has been trying to obtain a new trial. Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus would testify in his defense as a specialist of repressed memory, as many victims' testimonies against Sandusky are allegedly based on repressed memories. Publications and interviews Sandusky co-wrote an autobiography titled Touched: The Jerry Sandusky Story (), which was published in 2001. His co-writer was Keith \\"Kip\\" Richeal. The book also includes a quote in a forewordMerrill, Elizabeth,\\"No one, it seems, knows Jerry Sandusky\\", ESPN, November 11, 2011 4:17 pm ET.

Wallace Collection was based in Britain, naming itself after the famous museum adjacent to the headquarters of its record label, EMI. Its debut studio album, Laughing Cavalier, was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and was released in 1969. The single \\"Daydream\\" became a hit in 21 countries, including going #1 in Belgium. In the wake of its success, the group toured Europe, the United States, Mexico, and South America. It also composed the soundtrack to a French film, La Maison, in 1970. Later singles, such as \\"Love\\" and \\"Serenade\\", were hits in Belgium and some other countries but did not reach the level of \\"Daydream\\", and the group split up in 1971.

The band's 2nd album for EMI was simply titled 'Wallace Collection' [no relation to the Capitol American version of their first LP] worldwide, but it came out in France with a distinctive colour cover featuring a slightly alternate shot of the band and was titled 'Serenade', which is the unofficial title that album is commonly referred to. *The 'Candlelights to Satellites' album was a proposed comeback album recorded 1989-1990 featuring the band's original lineup, minus Jacques Namotte.

In the UK, EMI started to issue singles in stereo in the late spring of 1969. But in France and in some other European countries, buyers of EMI records had to wait until mid-1972 to be able to purchase local singles in stereo. Because the bulk of Wallace Collection singles from 1969-1971 were primarily French releases, it is the mono versions of many of these songs that are generally available. However, a few true stereo mix exist on foreign pressings. 'Daydream'/'Baby I Don't Mind' : the US and Canadian pressings of this single are not only in stereo but also features a unique mix of both sides (single tracking, different placement of instruments...).

Construction on the site started on December 13, 1965, and the first traverse team (named SPQML II) arrived in early 1966. The base was in continuous use until January 29, 1969, when it was closed but mothballed for future use, and was the most remote and coldest of any United States stations on the continent. It was also the site for the world's coldest measured average temperature for a month at that time, recorded in July 1968, at . History The station was operated and staffed by the National Science Foundation and United States Navy. A select team of four scientists and four navy personnel were on constant duty at the station, which was under the command of a naval medical doctor. Originally designed for two years of service, it was in use for three years. Until the Fuji Dome Station opened in 1995, it was the outpost at the highest altitude at above sea level. The effective altitude, due to polar circulation vortex was in excess of , making the base a useful location for high-altitude research. Although the cold never reached the record set at Vostok Station, the average temperature was consistently lower. The buildings on the base were assembled from five pre-fabricated units flown in by Hercules C-130 aircraft with ski landing gear. Four units formed the main building, which is 8x25 meters; and a smaller Jamesway huts unit was constructed 300 meters away. Two 75 kW diesel generators provided the necessary energy for the main unit; and an additional generator was maintained at the standby unit. In addition, a skiway was built for air transport. A meteorological tower was erected with instruments at varying heights to monitor the persistent thermal air inversion layer above the Antarctic snow. One primary purpose of the base was solar observations, given the high altitude, clear air, and relative short distance to the sun during the austral summer. But it was found that the base also provided unique opportunities to observe unusual weather phenomena. The major activities were: * Micro Meteorology Study: P. C. Dalrymple and L. A. Stroschein. A Micrometeorological system: Installation, performance, and problems . This consisted of a tower equipped with instruments to take multiple samples of wind speed, wind direction and temperature. Periodic readings were taken at multiple levels on the tower to attempt to understand the \\"topography of weather\\" and how they fit into the larger framework of weather on the polar and global environment. The flatness of the Antarctic Plateau made Plateau Station a unique \\"test tube\\" for this study. * Polar Illumination/Absorption Study: Michael Kuhn. Natural Illumination of the Antarctic Plateau . This was accomplished by the placement of multi color lenses with sensors that would measure the intensity of light striking the polar surface. Illumination from both direct and diffuse sources were periodically measured. Plateau Station was ideal for measuring this due to the relative clear atmospheric conditions. * Upper Atomospheric Study: This was made up of instrumentation that would transmit a spectrum of Radio Frequency energy up into the atmosphere . The instrumentation would then simultaneously measure the amount of energy being reflected back to it from the upper atmosphere. * Geomagnetic Study This consisted of large coils of wire that acted as sensors to measure the intensity of polar magnetic fields. Ice core samples were also made, but with mixed success. On October 29, 1966, the camp inhabitants experienced a severe snowquake that lowered the altitude by . This was apparently caused by hoar frost crystals below the surface. The teams were also monitored for medical and psychological effects, though it turned out that selection of staff precluded any notable emotional effects. White cell counts were found to decrease as a result of few immunological stimuli in the sterile environment. On 22 December 2007, the Norwegian-U.S. Scientific Traverse of East Antarctica visited the base and entered the buildings, finding that it was mostly intact. In 2017, the CoFi-Expedition made a stop at the Plateau Station. They entered the station through a hatch at the top of highest building, the watch tower. The base is completely snowbound nowadays. The only visible building at the base is the meteorological tower. The expedition left the base with the same general impression as the expedition in 2007 did. Researcher Sepp Kipfstuhl said: \\"If someone should visit the base in 10 or even 20 years, it'll have barely changed. The meteorological tower should be visible for the next 500 years.\\"  Climate  Temperature data for Plateau Station for July 1968 Plateau Station is one of the coldest places on earth and has ice cap climate.

The term was coined by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque (1784‚Äì1841), a botanist and Transylvania University professor who had studied Native American use of medicinal plants, wrote and lectured extensively on herbal medicine, and advised patients and sold remedies by mail. Rafinesque used the word eclectic to refer to those physicians who employed whatever was found to be beneficial to their patients (eclectic being derived from the Greek word eklego, meaning \\"to choose from\\"). History Eclectic medicine appeared as an extension of early American herbal medicine traditions such as \\"Thomsonian medicine\\" in the early 19th century, and included Native American medicine. Standard medical practices at the time made extensive use of purges with calomel and other mercury-based remedies, as well as extensive bloodletting. Eclectic medicine was a direct reaction to those barbaric practices as well as a desire to restrict Thomsonian medicine innovations to medical \\"professionals.\\" Alexander Holmes Baldridge (1795‚Äì1874) suggested that because of its American roots the tradition of Eclectic Medicine should be called the American School of Medicine. It bears resemblance to Physiomedicalism, which is practiced in the United Kingdom. In 1827, a physician named Wooster Beach founded the United States Infirmary on Eldridge Street in New York. Ten years later, in 1837, he founded the New York Medical Academy, which later became the Reformed Medical College of New York, the parent school of \\"Reformed Medicine.\\" The Eclectic Medical Institute in Worthington, Ohio graduated its first class in 1833. After local body snatching led to the notorious \\"Resurrection Riot\\" of 1839, the school was evicted from Worthington and settled in Cincinnati during the winter of 1842‚Äì43. The Cincinnati school, incorporated as the Eclectic Medical Institute (EMI), continued until its last class graduation in 1939, more than a century later. Over the decades, other Ohio medical schools had been merged into that institution. The American School of Medicine (Eclectic) in Cincinnati operated from 1839 to 1857, when it merged with the Eclectic Medical Institute.Former Cincinnati Medical Schools and Colleges, Archives and Rare Books, University Libraries, University of Cincinnati John S. Haller, A Profile in Alternative Medicine: The Eclectic Medical College of Cincinnati, 1835‚Äì1942, Kent State University Press, 1999, Eclectic medicine expanded during the 1840s as part of a large, populist anti-regular medical movement in North America. It used many principles of Samuel Thomson's family herbal medication but chose to train doctors in physiology and more conventional principles, along with botanical medicine. The American School of Medicine (Eclectic) trained physicians in a dozen or so privately funded medical schools, principally located in the midwestern United States. By the 1850s, several \\"regular\\" American medical tradespersons, especially from the New York Academy of Medicine, had begun using herbal salves and other preparations. The movement peaked in the 1880s and 1890s. The schools were not approved by the Flexner Report (1910), which was commissioned by a council within the American Medical Association. The report criticised Eclectic medical schools on the grounds that they had poor laboratory facilities and inadequate opportunities for clinical education in hospitals Flexner Report, 1910. In 1934, J. C. Hubbard, M.D., the president of the Eclectic Medical Association said: The last Eclectic Medical school closed in Cincinnati in 1939. The Lloyd Library and Museum still maintains the greatest collection of books, papers and publications of the Eclectic physicians, including libraries from the Eclectic medical schools. The contemporary herbalist Michael Moore recounts: Major Eclectic practitioners include John Uri Lloyd, John Milton Scudder, Harvey Wickes Felter, John King, Andrew Jackson Howe, Finley Ellingwood, Frederick J. Locke, and William N. Mundy.List of publications by Eclectic physicians, scanned by David Winston Harvey Wickes Felter's Eclectic Materia Medica is one of several important Eclectic medical publications dating from the 1920s. It represented a last attempt to stem the tide of \\"standard practice medicine\\", the antithesis of the model of the rural primary care vitalist physician who was the basis for Eclectic practice.

Scarry had been illustrating children's books since 1950, but this was his first as both author and illustrator. The book also marked the beginning of the author's work on the \\"Best Ever\\" series. The original edition contains over 1,400 labelled pictures and the book sold over seven million copies in 12 years. The word book is designed to entertain children while teaching them words and numbers. It is divided into subjects on each pair of pages. Subjects range from sports to houses, with examples from all over the world. The pages have a small amount of text, which often challenge the reader to find something on the page. The characters are all anthropomorphic animals, often cats, bears, rabbits and mice, but many other animals are also used. The art for Best Word Book Ever was first drawn in, then painted in, which was by that time Scarry's normal method.  Publication  The book was first published in the United States in 1963, followed by a British edition published in 1964 by Paul Hamlyn and reprinted in 1965. The Best Word Book Ever has been reprinted and revised many times since. The book has been translated into a number of other languages, including a bilingual edition in English and Spanish and one in Ukrainian.  Editing the Best Word Book Ever  The British edition was slightly altered for the British market. For example, the front cover shows a thatched cottage instead of an American style barn, the \\"When you grow up\\" pages feature a British soldier instead of an American one and a sprinkling of British Union Jack flags and text were inserted. By 1980 the book had been edited to remove some of what became perceived as stereotypical roles for females and to update terminology. At least 14 changes were made, including changing a male \\"policeman\\" to a female \\"police officer\\" on the front cover, and changing \\"handsome pilot\\" to \\"pilot\\" and \\"pretty stewardess\\" into \\"flight attendant.\\" The book was reduced in pages from 92 to 72 pages, removing such things as \\"In the Flower Garden.\\"  Related works  Following his great success with Best Word Book Ever, Richard Scarry went on to create a large number of other children's books in the same style with similar animals, a similar dominance of the art over the text and even similar names, including Best First Book Ever, Best Little Word Book Ever and his last book Richard Scarry's Biggest Word Book Ever.

Klevener de Heiligenstein, also known in English by its German name, Heiligensteiner Klevener,Gew√ºrztraminer  White Wines at www.whitewines.net, retrieved 14 Sep 2016. is a designation used on Alsace wine made from pink-skinned Savagnin rose grapes, a variety in the Traminer family, but which is less aromatic than Gew√ºrztraminer, which is widely planted in Alsace. The designation may be allowed for selected vineyards in the villages Bourgheim, Gertwiller, Goxwiller, Heiligenstein and Obernai but, under current appellation rules,INAO: AOC Alsace appellation regulations, updated until February 16, 2006 the designation may be used until 2021 for specified existing vineyards outside the designation area. Since Savagnin rose is not a permitted variety for other Alsace wines, its replanting outside this area is not allowed. Since most Alsace wines are varietally labeled, it is a common misunderstanding to believe \\"Klevener de Heiligenstein\\" to be a local variety. In fact, it is the only geographical designation within the Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) Alsace. History The Savagnin vine was introduced to the Alsace region in 1740 by Erhard Wantz, mayor of the village of Heiligenstein. Ampelographers believe that the cuttings that Wantz brought originated from vineyards planted in the Italian Alps near Chiavenna in Lombardy. J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 382 Oxford University Press 2006 In 1971, Vins par r√©gions/Alsace \\"Klevener de Heiligenstein \\" (French) Accessed: Jan 2nd, 2008 the Klevener de Heiligenstein designation was included in the AOC regulations for Alsace. It is not a separate appellation, but rather a designation within Alsace AOC which is defined both in terms of the grape variety and location within Alsace. This differs Klevener de Heiligenstein from the other varietal designations of Alsace AOC, which may be used in the entire region. Also, Savagnin rose grape is the only Alsatian grape variety which is restricted to a specific subregion of Alsace, i.e. to Heiligenstein and the specified areas of the surrounding villages cited above. T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 194 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Relationship to Gew√ºrztraminer Gew√ºrztraminer grapes. Savagnin Rose grapes are almost indistinguishable except for the translucent skin quality that the appear just prior to veraison. The vines of the Savagnin rose variety planted in Alsace bear striking similarities, morphologically, to Gew√ºrztraminer vines and are almost indistinguishable on inspection. Outside of DNA testing and analysis of the wine that both grapes produce, the only noticeable difference is that just prior to veraison the grapes of Savagnin rose turn almost translucent while the skins of Gew√ºrztraminer grapes are more opaque. While Gew√ºrztraminer was present in Alsace since the Middle Ages, the 18th century introduction of Savagnin rose did cause some confusion among vineyards as to which variety they had planted. The most obvious way to distinguish the two was to compare the type of wines that each produces with Gew√ºrztraminer wine being much more aromatic. Until the 1970s, winemakers would label wines of better quality \\"Gew√ºrztraminer\\" and wines of lesser quality \\"Traminer\\" or \\"Klevener de Heiligenstein\\", regardless of the final composition of Gew√ºrztraminer, Savagnin rose and/or Traminer in the wine. In 1973, the names Traminer and Savagnin Rose was discontinued from use on Alsatian wine labels. Due to the significant and early plantings of Savagnin rose in Heiligenstein and the villages around it, the wine style of \\"Klevener de Heiligenstein\\" was granted its place however. Wine style Klevener de Heiligenstein does have some similarities to wines made from its cousin grape, Gew√ºrztraminer. Both can produce dry wines with a slight spicy flavor that has the potential to age well, especially in favorable vintages. It is less aromatic than Gew√ºrztraminer with higher acidity and lower alcohol levels. Some styles can show a slight buttery flavor. J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 16 Oxford University Press 2006 Outside of exceptional vintages, Klevener de Heiligenstein typically has delicate fruit flavors that start to fade after 2‚Äì4 years. The wine is not to be confused with other wine made from grape varieties named Klevner, such as Pinot blanc which have frequently been called Klevner in Alsace, although this use seems on the decline.

Currently, she is the Spokesperson of the third largest party, Nepal Communist Party, Maoist Center.Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) She is also the first female politician to lead a political party; at age 32 she became the chairperson of the United Peoples‚Äô Front (Samyukta Janamorcha), the third largest party in the parliament in 1995. She comes from remote hills of Nepal, where she suffered discrimination as a girl child, and her struggle against it contributed to her political ideology. She entered in leftist politics when she was just 14 years old. As a seasoned politician, she is said to be humble and easily accessible yet very assertive, and an inspiration to the younger generation. With impeccable political career of over 40 years and one of the most honest politicians in the country, she commands enormous respect, and people consider her as one of the most influential female politicians of Nepal. In a recent interview she said, ‚ÄúMy last 40 years of struggle was to establish a federal republic and inclusive political order in the country, and my remaining years in politics will be dedicated for the economic development of the country and an equitable distribution of wealth among its people‚Äù.

Her parents had five daughters and endured humiliation and name calling from relatives and villagers alike. This discrimination against girls left Bhusal with deep scars. In her own words, ‚ÄúThere was extreme discrimination against a girl and I endured it in every step of the way. I would do the best in the class; people would say she is like a boy. I stood first in the whole school; people said how come she is like a boy. I would participate in social activities; people would say why she is doing a boy‚Äôs job. I did not like it. Why would they not accept my achievements as those of a girl? Why could a girl not do what a boy can? I rejected it. I was prepared to fight against it, and perhaps this is what started me on a revolutionary‚Äôs path.‚Äùhttp://kantipur.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-01-31/339239.html In the whole village few families had horses and radios. She used to ride horse and listen radio, like a typical boy. In an interview she said, ‚ÄúI used to listen news in the radio, particularly about woman leaders like Golda Meir from Israel, Simiravo Bandaranaike from Sri Lanka and Indira Gandhi from India. The social context of those days in the village had made me a revolutionary, a feminist. However, I became very happy when my mother finally gave birth to a boy, my brother. It used to hurt me to see my parents being humiliated by the villagers for not being able to give birth to a boy.‚Äù Financially, her family was relatively better off in the village. People used to come to borrow money from her parents. Ms. Bhusal noticed that the borrowers could not pay back the loan but would pay interest year after year; sometimes the accumulated interest would be more than the principal. She requested her parents to exonerate poor borrowers from their loans; they agreed. However, they did not publicly announce it, nor they asked the borrowers to pay back. Most of the loans were effectively forgiven and it was done without any publicity.http://kantipur.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-01-31/339239.html Struggle for an education In those days the society did not approve of sending girls to school. Instead, they believed if a girl child is married off, the mother would give birth to a boy. Till then, all of her siblings were girls and the parents desperately wanted a boy. So, both of her elder sisters were married off when they were just 8 years old. But Ms. Bhusal insisted in going to school, and her parents, particularly the mother supported. Despite social pressure, the parents wanted their children, although girls, to study. She got admitted in Janta Primary School. She was one of the three girls in the entire school. Every time she completed a grade, neighbors would argue that she did not need to go to school any more. But Ms. Bhusal insisted in continuing her education against all odds. She would walk two hours to go to her school, endure social humiliation, but nothing stopped her. With her parents‚Äô support she succeeded. She completed School Leaving Certificate Examination in 1979 from Jana Jyoti High School. And she decided to college.http://kantipur.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-01-31/339239.html For further education, she had to go to Kathmandu, and parents were not comfortable to send her daughter alone far away from home. This was a major obstacle, and not easy to overcome. But her determination finally won, ‚ÄúI cried. I stopped eating. Effectively I was on hunger strike until I was allowed to go to Kathmandu.‚Äù In Kathmandu she got admitted in IOE, Pulchowk Engineering Campushttps://ioe.edu.np/ as the only girl from her district going for an engineering education. She completed a diploma in engineering from IOE, Pulchowk Campus and studied commerce from Shankar Dev Campus. She also completed a bachelor's degree in education from Kirtipur Campus and a master's degree in sociology from Tribhuvan University.http://tribhuvan- university.edu.np/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/ In politics She entered in student politics in 1977 when she was studying at 8th grade, and just four years later in 1981 she took active membership of the Communist Party of Nepal. About her political grooming she says, ‚ÄúOur school was influenced by leftist ideology, and I liked it because it did not discriminate between boys and girls. It also was against various unjust practices prevailing in the society. I became a member of the All Nepal National Free Students‚Äô Union (ANNFSU), which was banned under the Panchayat regime. Later in 1986 I became the Central Committee Member of ANNFSU. This student association was influenced by leftist leaders. With guidance from Mr. Tanka Bhusal, who was martyred under Panchayat regime, I read books on Marxism. I also read books on liberation of women (including one from Mod Nath Prashrit). I realized that all discriminations can be overcome only through politics, and I decided to join political movement and become a communist.‚Äù In 1981 students organized a protest against rising prices of common goods. Ms. Bhusal, in a speech, declared, ‚ÄúThe main reason for such a price hike is the Palace (the King)‚Äù. She was arrested, and this was her first journey to a jail; many more followed later. In the subsequent 15 years (from 1981 to 1995), in her struggle against the autocratic rule of the king, she was arrested and jailed several times; even during the prime ministership of Mana Mohan Adhikari, a communist leader who led the Government under constitutional monarchy. In 1982 she became the general secretary of the prestigious All Nepal Women‚Äôs association (Akhil Nepal Mahila Sangh)http://nkcs.org.np/cdc/library/opac_css/index.php?lvl=author_see&id;=2207 chaired by Parijat, the legendary writer and novelist. In the ensuing decade, she played active roles in the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) ‚Äì fourth Convention, CPN ‚Äì Mashal, CPN ‚Äì Unity Center, Samyukta Janamorcha and CPN ‚Äì Maoist Center. She was the chairperson of Samyukta Janamorcha, thus becoming the first female politician in Nepal to lead a political party. In 1996 the CPN (Maoist) started the people‚Äôs war. To effectively manage the civil war, a central committee of 19 members was constituted under the leadership of Chairman Prachanda,Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Ms. Bhusal was the only female member of the committee. She went underground and fought the war until the peace negotiations. Peace agreement and in governance When the Maoists come to the peace process, she became a member of the Maoist Negotiating Team led by Chairman Prachanda. As a result of the peace negotiation, an interim government was formed headed by Late Girija Prasad Koirala,Girija Prasad Koirala in which Ms. Bhusal became the Minister of Women, Children and Social Welfare. In the first constitutional assembly election held in 2008 she contested from Latitpur constituency number 3 and won the election in a landslide victory. Subsequently, she became the Minister of General Administration in the first republican government led by Chairman PrachandaPushpa Kamal Dahal as the Prime Minister. She also became the Minister of Peace and Reconstruction in the cabinet led by Jhala Nath Khanal.Jhala Nath Khanal Leadership in development activities While in the government and as a citizen, Ms. Bhusal has played significant leadership role in various development activities in the country, which has earned her a name: the development loving leader. She is always busy solving peoples‚Äô day-to-day problems, including expanding and building roads and bridges; improving drinking water, irrigation and drainage systems; expanding access to quality education to underprivileged children and so on. During the constitution drafting process she led her party in various parliamentary committees such as Governance and Election Process Committee, and argued in favor of proportional representation of all ethnicity, religious groups and women in the parliament. She also furthered the agenda on direct election of the executive president and/or the prime minister. While serving on Rajya Byabestha Samiti she influenced decisions in favor of good governance and fought against corruption.

Efat Ghazi was born in a Kurdish family in Iranian Kurdistan. Her father, Qazi Muhammad, was president of the short-lived Republic of Mahabad, which was proclaimed in Iranian Kurdistan in 1946. After studying law in Iran, Ghazi worked as a teacher, a profession she continued in Sweden where she later arrived as a refugee. She gained habitual residence in 1985 but never had Swedish citizenship. In Sweden, she reunited with her husband, Emir Ghazi, with whom she had two daughters. Emir Ghazi was a former member of the politburo of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (PDK-I) and later leader of the Independence Party of Kurdistan. Efat Ghazi was not politically active. On 6 September 1990, at about 12:45 p.m., Ghazi was seriously wounded after opening a letter bomb outside her family's house in V√§ster√•s. She was taken to a hospital where she died from her wounds three hours later. From the letter remainders which the police collected from the crime scene, it was confirmed that the letter bomb was addressed to her husband. The Iranian government was quickly suspected by many of having ordered the assassination, which had many similarities to other assassinations and assassination attempts of Iranian political exiles around the world at this time. However, a few years after the assassination, the Swedish police closed the investigation citing lack of evidence. Thousands of people showed up at the funeral in V√§ster√•s, many of them from abroad. Among the speakers at the funeral was C.-H. Hermansson, former leader of the Swedish Left Party.

He also wrote autos sacramentales in Quechua ‚ÄîEl robo de Proserpina y sue√±o de Endimi√≥n (c. 1650) and El hijo pr√≥digo (c. 1657)‚Äî; comedies in Spanish ‚Äîout of which only the biblical play Amar su propia muerte (c. 1650) is preserved‚Äî; panegyric sermons ‚Äîcompiled after his death in a volume called La Novena Maravilla (1695)‚Äî; and a course in Latin of thomistic philosophy ‚ÄîPhilosophia Thomistica (1688)‚Äî. He acquired fame in life for the stylistic distinction and conceptual depth of his oeuvre (which was praised for its first-rate accordance to the scholastic and baroque epistemological parameters of his time). His polymathy, erudition and poetic ingenuity in the composition of sermons and literary works gained him the epithets of Sublime Doctor and Indian Demosthenes, as well as the less frequent ones of Criollo Phoenix and Tertullian of the Americas (all used to refer to him while alive). Additionally, after the Peruvian independence from Spanish Imperial rule took place, Juan de Espinosa Medrano's memory begun to be used as an exemplary model of the intellectual and moral potential of the peoples from South America (criollo, mestizos and indigenous populations included). The circumstances of Juan de Espinosa Medrano's origin, and the details about his first years of life, are‚Äîalmost in their entirety‚Äîunknown. The absence of significant biographical data put forward in the will written by the own author days before his death has further led to speculation about his ethnicity (or race) and identification. It has also led to manipulation and tendentious interpretations of the data preserved about his existence; such distortive reading has been especially pronounced in the many works of biographers, critics or commentators, akin to the political agenda of Indigenismo in Peru. What is incontrovertible, however, is that Juan de Espinosa Medrano always regarded himself both as Criollo and Spanish (an ideological servant of the Empire); evidences for such self-identification are to be found in his oeuvre, in which Juan de Espinosa Medrano sides constantly with the Spaniards, and often describes Native American populations as 'enemies', 'barbarous' and 'idolatrous' (he does not link himself with Native American peoples' cultures and ethnicity, and it is also unthinkable that an indigenous person could have held the power and clergy positions he did during his lifetime). His vast baroque production, written in Spanish, Latin and Quechua‚Äîin an aesthetic register different to the dialects now extant‚Äîwas published both in America and Europe, however, only at the end of his life in the Old World. It had impact exclusively in the Viceroyalty of Peru, nonetheless, particularly because of a sabotage plan carried out by Jesuit priests in Rome at the end of the XVII century, which succeeded in impeding the circulation of Juan de Espinosa Medrano's philosophic course in Latin across the Old World (the work is the aforementioned Philosophia Thomistica). It was in this period that the Jesuit University of Saint Ignatius of Loyola contended with the Seminary of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco ‚Äîinstitution that Juan de Espinosa Medrano represented‚Äî for the maintenance of its right in exclusivity to grant the degree of doctor to those instructed in Theology (a situation that forced the Seminary students, of Thomist instruction, to present themselves before a jury of Jesuit theologians ‚Äîfollowers of the doctrine of Francisco Su√°rez‚Äî for the evaluation leading to the conferral of their degree). In the present, the mysteries of his biography and the intrinsic quality of his literary production notwithstanding, the study of the works and life of Juan de Espinosa Medrano has extensively fallen to relegation or oblivion. This way, even if a certain part of his biography still survives in the oral tradition of the region of Apur√≠mac‚Äîwhere it has acquired unusual characteristics‚Äî, in Cusco as well as in the Peruvian Literary Canon, knowledge of his life and work circumscribes mostly to scholars of literature in Colonial Spanish America.  Biography  = Origin and first years = Present state of the Seminary of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco (located in Plaza Nazarenas in the contemporary city of Cusco). The Seminar's facilities have been divided and today make a hotel, a museum and a parish. After a series of studies and archive analysis, the space-time coordinate of Calcauso, 1630, appears to be the most accurate intersection in which to place the origin (the birth) of Juan de Espinosa Medrano. Of his parents, their ethnicity, condition and lineage, nothing is known; such complete lack of information serves, however, as a principle for the deduction of absence of nobility in the author and his family ‚Äîbeing most likely that Juan de Espinosa Medrano grew up in a humble, rural environment. This setting is, at the same time, somewhat suggestive of a possible case of miscegenation as explanation of his origin, theory that holds ground especially since it is inconceivable to think of the author as an indio or indigenous person (it seems more verisimilar to think of Juan de Espinosa Medrano as a mestizo: probably conceived by an india or mestiza mother, in a rural area of Cuzco, after sexual intercourse with a Spaniard, perhaps a cleric who would not have, of course, assumed paternity of the child). Consequently, Agust√≠n Cort√©s de la Cruz's ‚Äîdisciple and first biographer of the author‚Äî assertion about the origin of Espinosa Medrano should be taken as true: \\"in his first stages, scant favor he received from what the vulgus calls Fortune\\". Quotes translations by Milton Andr√© Ramos Chac√≥n. Likewise, Clorinda Matto de Turner's novelization of the author's life as: \\"He who entered the world in humble cradle, set foot on the steps of book and prayer... Then ascended to reach the literary skies of the America of the South, as king of stars there he shined\\". In an imperial society in which access to intellectual enterprise was circumscribed to the nobles and highborns, Espinosa Medrano achieved prominent instruction, overcoming the difficulties of a rural, unprivileged genesis. This reality does not guarantee, however, that he was an indio (as Clorinda Matto and the oral tradition asseverate) for he would not have become a sacred preacher and reached fortune and power in Cuzco had this been the case (such activities and wealth were then inaccessible to the native castes). The enigma of Juan de Espinosa Medrano's origin acts (still) as a recurrent stimulus for the creation of an oral and imaginary biography in which the author is an Indian. The model for such constant imagination in Peru lies on the biographical approximation to the author that Clorinda Matto undertook at the end of the XIX century (Clorinda Matto de Turner made Espinosa Medrano the subject of an \\"indigenist\\" legend, imputing indigenous ancestry to him, \\"but archival research has shown that there is no evidence that Espinosa Medrano was a pitifully poor Indian, but on the contrary, that he was a man of fairly substantial means closer to the figure of a 'baroque gentleman' \\"). = The early and indigenous biography of Juan de Espinosa Medrano by Clorinda Matto = Clorinda Matto de Turner, author of a biography on Juan de Espinosa Medrano titled \\"Don Juan de Espinosa Medrano ‚Äîthat is‚Äî the Spotty-Faced Doctor\\" ‚Äîincluded in Pencil Sketches of Acclaimed Americans (1890). Her biographical construction of Espinosa Medrano is now the most familiar in Peruvian popular culture and the Andean provinces in the Republic of Peru. Clorinda Matto de Turner published her famous biographical study \\"Don Juan de Espinosa Medrano ‚Äîthat is‚Äî the Spotty-Faced Doctor\\" in 1887 in Lima, the capital of Peru. Three years later, after small corrections, she published the biographical study again in Pencil Sketches of Acclaimed Americans (1890), book that includes a chapter on Juan de Espinosa Medrano that Clorinda Matto was able to elaborate after obtaining data from the oral tradition in rural Peru. Clorinda Matto's biographical study is, in substantial sections, barely rigorous for it is troubled by the absence of documentary evidence ‚Äîa void that she seeks to fill through an exercise of fictionalization of the life of Espinosa Medrano. Such purpose (though still laudable for its exaltation of the author) has led the present academic community to question the legitimacy of her biography up to such a dramatic point that, in the present, her work is no longer considered legitimate or true (on the contrary, her biography is now discarded as a source for fantasy, especially for its lack of historical objectivity). The manifest ideological character that the text also displays ‚Äîand that Clorinda Matto does not pretend to camouflage‚Äî has further led to the dismissal of her biographical attempt as inaccurate. It is, in summary, averse to the aspiration to truth present in biographical works of such nature. Clarification in place, it is nonetheless necessary to briefly refer to the biography of Espinosa Medrano as it was composed in 1887/1890 by Clorinda Matto. For her biography is still the most influential source for Peruvian popular imagination of the author, as well as the most and only known outside of the academic world. According to Clorinda Matto, Juan de Espinosa Medrano was the offspring of an indigenous conjugal union, that of Agust√≠n Espinosa and Paula Medrano, humble parents that raised their little child \\"in a shack at the joyous town\\". At seven, Juan started his education at the class for infants taught by the priest of Mollebamba, class where ‚Äîbesides being a remarkable student‚Äî Juan de Espinosa Medrano would also receive instruction to act as sacristan of the parish (the parish is, according to Clorinda Matto's biography, the place in which Espinosa Medrano discovered both the religious and literate vocation that would later flourish in him as time went by). After a period of instruction and service in favor of the priest of Mollebamba, Juan de Espinosa Medrano would start a life in the city of Cuzco as an indio servant. According to Matto, there he would obtain admission into the Seminary of Saint Anthony the Abbot, precinct where the young Juan de Espinosa Medrano would quickly develop mastery of different musical instruments and skill in seven languages. He would also reach expertise in sciences and grammar, according to this biography, erudition that would cause admiration in his contemporaries. Espinosa Medrano would finally obtain the degree of Doctor, at eighteen years old, in the Jesuit University of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. From that point onwards, he would have to defy the common prejudice that asserted that no Indian could take hold of ecclesiastical charges of significance in Cuzco.Raquel Chang-Rodriguez, Hidden Messages: Representation and Resistance in Andean Colonial Drama (Bucknell University Press, 1999), 85. = Ecclesiastical career and intellectual endeavors = \\"The panegyric prayer to James the Great (or Moorslayer)\\" is one fundamental texts to consult in order to understand Juan de Espinosa Medrano's cultural self-identification. The sermon was preached in the Cathedral of Cuzco and later published in the volume La Novena Maravilla (The Ninth Wonder). Documentation found indicates that by the year 1645, when he was about fifteen years old, Juan de Espinosa Medrano was a student in the Seminary of Saint Anthony the Abbot. His tutors in this institution were: Francisco de Loyola, Augustinian prior and cofounder, in 1559, of the Monastery of Saint Augustine in Cuzco ‚ÄîLoyola stated that young Juan was \\"an exceptional prowess, and also very virtuous\\"‚Äî; Juan de C√°rdenas y C√©spedes, famous dean of the Seminary of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco (from 1632 to 1702, the year he passed away); and Alonso Bravo de Paredes y Qui√±ones, sacred preacher and professor of philosophy at the Seminary ‚ÄîParedes y Qui√±ones was also a censor of the Apolog√©tico). Juan de Espinosa Medrano's studies must have extended until 1649 or 1650, years that provide records of him now in charge of the art classes at the Seminary. Between 1655 and 1657, Espinosa Medrano would acquire the degree of Doctor in Theology (after evaluation at the Jesuit University of Saint Ignatius of Loyola), performing as professor of such sacred discipline at the Seminary starting from 1658. In 1655, Juan de Espinosa Medrano's ecclesiastical career starts. He serves, in the first place, at the Parish of the Sanctum (Parroquia del Sagrario) where he conducts a series of marriage ceremonies and baptisms ‚Äîa final one documentally registered in 1659. In 1656, Juan de Espinosa Medrano begins his sacred preaching career. His first sermon \\"The panegyric prayer to Our Lady of Antiquity\\" (\\"La oraci√≥n paneg√≠rica a Nuestra Se√±ora de la Antigua\\") is followed by the \\"First sermon to Saint Anthony the Abbot\\" (\\"Serm√≥n Primero de San Antonio Abad\\"), preached in 1658; the \\"First Sermon to Saint Blaise, bishop and martyr\\" (\\"Serm√≥n de San Blas obispo y m√°rtir\\"), preached in 1659; and \\"The panegyric prayer to James the Great (or Moorslayer)\\" (\\"Oraci√≥n paneg√≠rica al glorioso Ap√≥stol Santiago\\") in 1660, perhaps the most important sermon for the comprehension of Juan de Espinosa Medrano's oeuvre. In 1662, in Lima, the Apologetic in defense of Luis de G√≥ngora (Apolog√©tico en favor de Don Luis de G√≥ngora) is published. It is important to highlight, however, that Espinosa Medrano's intellectual activity in the profane had already started in the decade of 1650 ‚Äîthe biblical play To Love One's Own Death (Amar su propia muerte) had been written c. 1650; the autos sacramentales The Seizure of Proserpine and the Dream of Endymion (El robo de Proserpina y sue√±o de Endimi√≥n) and The Prodigal Son (El hijo pr√≥digo) had also been written c.1650 and c.1657 respectively. Portrait of the Viceroy Count of Lemos. According to written records, the Viceroy ordered his entourage that Juan de Espinosa Medrano's works be sent to the printing press in Spain. From 1664 to 1680, Juan de Espinosa Medrano continues writing panegyric sermons to be preached in diverse religious precincts of Cuzco. Among the most important are the \\"Sermon for the Funeral of Philip IV\\" (\\"Serm√≥n a las Exequias de Felipe IV\\") in 1666 and the \\"Panegyric Prayer to the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady\\" (\\"Oraci√≥n Paneg√≠rica a la Concepci√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora\\") in 1670. Espinosa Medrano further advanced in his ecclesiastical career by acting as priest of Juliaca from 1660 to 1668. That year a miners uprising takes places in the town of Laicacota, the same that is repressed by the Viceroy Pedro Antonio Fern√°ndez de Castro, Count of Lemos. From 1669 to 1676, Espinosa Medrano takes charge of the parish of Chincheros (today part of the Sacred Valley of the Incas). Finally, from 1678 to 1683/1684 he acts as priest of the parish of Saint Cristopher (San Crist√≥bal), one of the most important Indian parishes of Cuzco even today. From this period in the adult life of Juan de Espinosa Medrano it is necessary to highlight two events in which he demonstrated his prowess to peoples in possession of high positions in the Spanish Imperial System. The first event corresponds El primer evento corresponde a la visita al Cuzco del Virrey Conde de Lemos en 1668, paso que permite al Virrey la lectura (o audici√≥n) de obras l√≠ricas y sagradas de Juan de Espinosa Medrano, las mismas que quiz√°s fueron preparadas para su recepci√≥n. El evento es fundamental por demostrar, en la biograf√≠a del author, reconocimiento oficial a la distinci√≥n de su producci√≥n barroca (cuya singularidad los coterr√°neos alababan). Seg√∫n el testimonio del ya mencionado primer bi√≥grafo y albacea, Agust√≠n Cort√©s de la Cruz, \\"El se√±or Conde de Lemos luego que oy√≥ en el Cuzco algunas obras y versos [de Espinosa Medrano] con que le celebr√≥ el Colegio de San Antonio, los hizo trasladar, sin que quedase papel que no fuese digno de su estimaci√≥n, por darlos a la estampa en Espa√±a\\". Lamentablemente, nada concreto se sabe sobre la veracidad y el paradero de este traslado de su obra a Europa. El segundo evento de importancia para la biograf√≠a de Juan de Espinosa Medrano corresponde al env√≠o de una carta a Carlos II, Rey de Espa√±a, por parte del obispo del Cuzco, Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo en 1678. Este evento muestra, con mayor claridad, la admiraci√≥n y alta estima que se ten√≠a hacia al author tanto por parte del √°mbito religioso como tambi√©n por parte del letrado en la ciudad. El nombre de Juan de Espinosa Medrano ‚Äîse ve aqu√≠‚Äî empieza a ser difundido m√°s all√° del obispado colonial del Cuzco y el Virreinato del Per√∫. El obispo recomienda en la carta la asignaci√≥n de un puesto en la Catedral del Cuzco para Espinosa Medrano y escribe al rey: \\"es el sujeto m√°s digno que tiene el obispado por sus muchas y relevantes letras y virtud\\". It is known that he entered the Dominican seminary of San Antonio Abad in Cuzco. There, as a young student, he wrote many of his plays.Raquel Chang-Rodriguez, Hidden Messages: Representation and Resistance in Andean Colonial Drama (Bucknell University Press, 1999), 84. He wrote plays in both Spanish and Quechua. He wrote in Spanish the drama Amar su propia muerte (To Love One's Own Death) (ca. 1645). Characters of this play include S√≠sara, a general of Canaan; Jab√≠n, king of Canaan; Jael; Barac, a general of the armies of Israel. He wrote in Quechua a religious play, El hijo pr√≥digo (also known as Auto sacramental del hijo pr√≥digo; The Prodigal Son),Biografia de Juan de Espinosa Medrano as well as a mythological piece, El rapto de Proserpina (The Abduction of Proserpina). The theatrical piece Ollantay is also attributed to him. He also wrote a piece defending G√≥ngora's poetry called Apolog√©tico en favor de Don Luis de G√≥ngora, Pr√≠ncipe de los poetas lyricos de Espa√±a: contra Manuel de Faria y Sousa, Cavallero portugu√©s (1662). In the Apolog√©tico, published in Lima in 1662, Espinosa Medrano eruditely displays his knowledge of classical and contemporary literature. To support his arguments, Espinosa Medrano refers to, among others, the works of Apuleius, Augustine of Hippo, the Bible, Camoens, Miguel de Cervantes, Erasmus, Faria, Garcilaso, Homer, Lope de Vega, and Pedro de O√±a.El Lunarejo: Identidad mestiza y cr√≠tica literaria His defense of G√≥ngora has been viewed as \\"a plea for recognition on behalf of himself and of writers living and working on the periphery of the Spanish empire.\\" Antonio Cort√©z de la Cruz, one of his disciples, collected Espinosa Medrano's sermons and published them posthumously in Valladolid, in a book entitled La novena maravilla (The Ninth Wonder) (1695). Espinosa Medrano also wrote La L√≥gica (Logic), the first volume of a tract devoted to the philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas, which was published in Rome in 1688.Raquel Chang-Rodriguez, Hidden Messages: Representation and Resistance in Andean Colonial Drama (Bucknell University Press, 1999), 84-5.

It is the period when all the remaining construction of the ship is completed and readied for delivery to her owners. Since most of the fitting-out process is interior work, this stage can overlap with latter stages, such as the sea trials. Launching or floating After a vessel has been floated (in contemporary shipbuilding) or launched (in traditional shipbuilding), it is then towed out of its drydock and moored at a fitting-out berth. While still afloat, its construction is then continued. Depending on the type of vessel, fitting-out can last weeks or many months. Vessels with comparatively little space for human occupation, such as oil tankers, bulk carriers and container ships, can take the least time for fitting. Conversely, passenger ships take the longest. The process can include: * completion of the superstructure, * installation of the ship‚Äôs power plant, engines, and other machinery, * interior equipment and systems, including electrical, plumbing, and HVAC, * finishing of interior spaces, * and installation of furnishings. Whatever construction is completed during fitting is also dependent on the shipyard‚Äôs capabilities and the availability of equipment prior to floating. For example, Queen Mary 2 was originally to have its propeller pods installed prior to floating, but this was not done until the fitting-out stage. Contemporary ship construction usually has the vessel returning to drydock several times for installation of propulsion mechanisms (such as propulsion pods in contemporary vessels) and for the painting of surfaces below the waterline.

It runs through urban landscapes of eastern Saint Paul in Ramsey County and rural farmland and forests in Washington County. It was designated a National Recreation Trail in 2002. The trail is open to walking, jogging, cycling, inline skating, and roller skiing during the summer. A side trail is designed for horseback riding. During the winter separate sections invite snowshoeing or cross-country skiing. Both horseback riding and cross-country skiing require permits from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  Historical development  =Historical significance= The Gateway State Trail follows part of the Soo Line Railroad that served the upper Midwest and connected the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota with the Twin Ports of Duluth and Superior, Wisconsin on Lake Superior. =Trail history and evolution= In 1980 the \\"Interstate Commerce Commission issued an order, authorizing abandonment of the Soo Line railroad track on January 23, 1980, 'conditioned on a public use in accordance with the plans of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.' That condition opened the door for converting the railroad line into a recreational trail, and interested citizens seized the opportunity.\\" At the urging of county governments, the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) took steps to acquire the eastern of the designated rail. However citizens owning abutting private property started a bidding war in an attempt to stop the creation of the trail. Money given by the Minnesota Parks Foundation allowed the state to purchase the property in auction, but the citizens then brought a suit against the state arguing that \\"the right-of-way reverted to abutting property owners once it ceased to be operated for railroad purposes. In a landmark decision, the Minnesota Supreme Court held that no such reversion takes place as long as the right-of-way continues to be used for public travel purposes even as a recreational trail.\\" After the Minnesota Supreme Court decision, the state acquired the western of the trail. The Minnesota Legislature appropriated funds to build the trail in 1990, and in 1993 the trail opened for use. Recently the state has acquired property to extend the Gateway Trail north to Taylors Falls, south to the Minnesota State Capitol, and east to downtown Stillwater. The Stillwater connection, via the Brown's Creek State Trail, was completed in 2014. However funding to complete newly acquired sections of the trail has not been appropriated. Trail development A section of the Gateway State Trail with parallel paved and unpaved trackways =Design and construction= An asphalt track runs the entire length of the developed corridor, and a segregated natural surface track for horseback riding and cross country skiing parallels the asphalt track for between Interstate 694 and the trail's terminus at Pine Point Regional Park. In winter the segment of paved track along the natural surface track is groomed for cross country skiing. The trail is wheelchair accessible, and many road crossings are served with under or over passes. =Amenities= Parking, restrooms, and water fountains are provided along the route. At the Phalen-Keller Regional Park picnic tables, a fishing dock, softball/baseball diamonds, playgrounds, and a sliding hill are available. At the Pine Point County Park trailhead, picnic tables are available. Community gardens are located along the trail, and community artists are also featured. During the winter the western sections of the trail are plowed, while the eastern sections are left unplowed to allow for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Community The trail is maintained by the state Department of Natural Resources. A conservation group, the Parks and Trail Council of Minnesota, works to promote wildlife and conservation efforts along the trail. Members of the Brown's Creek Trail Association (GBCTA), a citizen's group, support the trail through their efforts to: * Promote improvements to make the trail a pleasurable experience for all users and abutting property owners * Support adequate state funding for trail maintenance * Publish a newsletter on trail events, improvements and ecology * Provide feedback, support and constructive criticism to the State DNR * Provide a forum for the competing needs of recreational users and abutting property owners * Sponsor \\"Adopt-a-Trail\\" commitments to help keep the trail and abutting property clean * Develop signage and educational programs for public use The Gateway Brown's Creek Trail Association also works with local schools and artists to place artwork along the trail. A recent project, headed by local Hmong American artist David Vang, has focused on interpretations of the word \\"welcome\\" in the cultures of people who live along and utilize the trail. Local students at the Mississippi Magnet Creative Arts School created tiles interpreting their idea of welcome, and a mosaic of them will serve as a welcome sign for a future community garden site. Note that the previous name for the GBCTA was the Gateway Trail Association.

He is a dual player in that he also plays hurling for Banagher, and has in the past also hurled for Derry. In football, he is seen as a mobile, very tight marking corner-back, who is also very competent with the ball in his hands going forward, proven by the fact he plays midfield for his club. He has won three Irish News Ulster All-Star awards (1998, 1999 and 2001) and was named left-corner back on the Irish News Team of the Decade in 2004. Lockhart holds the record for the highest number of appearances in the International Rules Series, having represented Ireland sixteen times over the course of eight series (1998‚Äì2006) Personal life Lockhart is married to a woman called Miram, she is also a teacher, with three children.

He was already playing for Derry's Senior team, having made his debut in October 1995 in a National League encounter against Kerry. Derry went on to win the 1995/1996 National League with Lockhart playing left half forward in the final against Donegal. He made his Championship debut against Armagh that year. Lockhart and Derry finished runners-up to Offaly in the 1998 National League decider. Later that year he won the Ulster Senior Championship with Derry, with Lockhart's performance in the Ulster final was described as \\"outstanding\\". Derry lost to Galway in the All-Ireland Championship semi- final. He was named full back on the 1998 All-Star team and awarded Footballer of the Year by the Ulster GAA Writers Association. Lockhart won another National League medal in 2000, playing in his more familiar position in the full back line. He was nominated in 2000 for an All Star, but narrowly missed out. 2001 saw Derry reach the All-Ireland semi-final again and Lockhart was again nominated for an All Star. He was awarded the Ulster Tennent's Monthly Merit Award for May 2003, for his two performances against Tyrone that month. He kept six-time All Star Peter Canavan scoreless from play in both the drawn game and replay. Derry reached the All-Ireland semi-final again in 2004, but were defeated by Kerry.

In 1998 he was chosen as Irish Player of the Series and in 2004 he was chosen on the Supreme team to mark 20 years of Ireland versus Australia International Rules tests. It has been said part of the reason for him excelling in International Rules is that his fitness levels are as high as the professional Australian Rules athletes. He was selected as a runner for the Irish team for the 2008 Series, with selector Anthony Tohill citing his experience as being helpful. Although his official role was the runner, he \\"had a significant involvement in coaching the Irish squad\\". He also took an active part in training, and was impressive, and was on ready to come into the team if the Irish squad suffered a few injuries. =Province= =School/college= Lockhart was captain of the St. Patrick's College, Maghera side that won the 1995 MacRory Cup, playing centre half back.

The brother of former major league first baseman Hal Breeden, Danny graduated from Albany High School (Albany, Georgia). He attended Troy State University before being signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1963 as an amateur free agent. Even before making the majors, Breeden had been part of several player transactions. In December 1963, he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the first-year draft but the following year he was purchased back by the Cardinals. In December 1968, he was part of a multi- player trade to the San Diego Padres, and on in June 1969 he was purchased by the Reds. Less than a month after being purchased by the Reds, he made his big league debut at age 27 on July 24, 1969 against Gary Gentry and the New York Mets at Shea Stadium. Breeden, starting at catcher, notched his first career hit in his first at-bat with a second-inning single, going 1-for-4 in the game. The Reds defeated the Mets 4-3 in 12 innings on a Tony P√©rez home run. That one single would be his only big league hit that season. He played in only that series against the Mets as starting catcher Johnny Bench was not available, and he was 0-for-4 in his final two games of the season. Breeden spent the 1970 season in the Reds' minor league system, and was traded to the Cubs for Willie Smith on November 30, 1970.\\"Center Fielders Are Exchanged,\\" The New York Times, Tuesday, December 1, 1970.

The 1971 season was also his brother Hal's rookie season with the Cubs, and they played on the field together for five games. Danny batted .154 in 65 at-bats, hitting no home runs and driving in four runs. He hit the only extra-base hit of his career in his first game of the season, on May 1 against Rick Wise and the Philadelphia Phillies. His brother Hal hit .139 in 36 at-bats. The 1971 season was Danny Breeden's last one in the majors. After 1971 he played in the minors two more seasons for the Cubs, San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres organizations. In 2005, he was inducted into the Albany High School Sports Hall of Fame, joining his brother, Hal, who was inducted in 1996.

It currently houses the offices of the political science faculty at the university.A Brief History of North Hall--The First Building Constructed on the University of Wisconsin Campus Muir knoll, across the street, was home to the first American university ski tournament in 1920. Architecture North Hall was opened at the University of Wisconsin on September 17, 1851, as the North Dormitory. The sandstone building, which cost $19,000, was typical to educational buildings of the era. The four-story building is rectangular, has a hipped roof, and features little decoration. The east and west facades have ten bays; the center four project slightly beyond the other six. Single-door entrances are found on these facades near the ends. A plain yet deep cornice decorates the roofline. Windows and doors have plain lintel blocks and eight interior chimneys protrude from the roof. As the initial design was as a dormitory, the building was originally divided into twenty-four suites with a study room and one or two bedrooms. Classrooms were built on the fourth floor. In 1884, a fire destroyed Science Hall, which housed many of the classes on campus, so North Hall was re-purposed to hold classes and offices on all floors. The exterior has retained its original appearance. The interior has been largely remodeled, although original staircases are in place and some rooms maintain their original arrangements. History The original developmental plan for North Hall was produced in 1850 by Chancellor John Lathrop and illustrated by architect John F. Rague.Blanche Higgins Shroer and S. Sydney Bradford (May 1975) , National Park Service and It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965.

Performing arts career Robert Taub is a concert pianist renowned for his performances of Beethoven and contemporary music. He has performed as guest soloist with the world's leading orchestras, including the MET Orchestra in Carnegie Hall, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, BBC Philharmonic, The Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, and many others. As winner of the first Peabody Mason Award (1983), his debut performance was at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, New York City. In addition to his performances with leading orchestras, Taub has performed solo concerts on the Great Performers Series at New York's Lincoln Center and other major series worldwide. He has initiated and directed several concert series and festivals - including a nationally broadcast series at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (where his only predecessor as Artist-in-Residence was T.S. Eliot). Taub has recorded the complete Sonatas of Beethoven and Scriabin, as well as works of Robert Schumann, and Franz Liszt, several of which have been selected as \\"critic's favorites\\" by Gramophone, Newsweek, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. His most recently released recording is the Sessions Piano Concerto with James Levine and the Munich Philharmonic. Taub's book ‚Äì Playing the Beethoven Piano Sonatas ‚Äì has become a standard for the Beethoven literature, and his research with Beethoven source material led him to prepare a new edition of the Beethoven Piano Sonatas for Schirmer Performance Editions, a subsidiary of Hal Leonard Corporation. A champion of new music as well as established literature, Taub has premiered piano concertos by Milton Babbitt (MET Orchestra, James Levine) and Mel Powell (Los Angeles Philharmonic), and making the first recordings of the Vincent Persichetti 'Piano Concerto (Philadelphia Orchestra, Charles Dutoit) and Roger Sessions Piano Concerto. He has premiered six works of Babbitt (solo piano, chamber music, 2nd Piano Concerto). Taub also initiated collaborations with several younger composers, including Jonathan Dawe (USA), David Bessell (UK) and Ludger Br√ºmmer (Germany), performing their 21st century works in America and Europe. Robert Taub is an eloquent spokesman for music, giving engaging and informal lectures and pre-concert talks. Taub was featured on the PBS television program Big Ideas, which highlighted him playing and discussing Beethoven Piano Sonatas. Filmed during his seventh and final year at the Institute for Advanced Study, this program has been broadcast throughout the US on PBS affiliates. Education and academic career Taub is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Princeton, where he was a University Scholar. He completed his doctoral degree at The Juilliard School as a Danforth Fellow. Studying under principal teacher Jacob Lateiner, Taub received the school's highest award in piano. Taub has served as Blodgett Artist-in-Residence at Harvard University, UC Davis, and the Institute for Advanced Study. He has led music forums and master classes at Oxford and Cambridge Universities, as well as The Juilliard School. He has also been Visiting Professor at Princeton University and Kingston University (London, UK), teaching courses in Beethoven and music history, as well as piano, chamber music, and collaborative piano. Entrepreneurship and MuseAmi Building upon his experiences and achievements in the performing arts, Taub founded MuseAmi, a music software and technology company, in 2008. Inspired by his daughter's experiences learning violin, Taub envisioned a technology that could \\"see\\" and \\"hear\\" music the way people do, with a goal of enhancing the way individuals create, learn, collaborate upon, and share music. With MuseAmi, Taub attracted a high- powered team of machine learning experts, signal processing engineers, and creative developers. By using advanced techniques of machine learning and digital signal processing, MuseAmi has created highly efficient software to detect, analyze, and categorize visual and audio inputs in real world contexts. Under Taub's leadership, the company has developed significant intellectual property and has been awarded several patents.  Return to performing  Following his MuseAmi-based sabbatical from concert life, Robert Taub returned to his performing career in 2016 with new performing projects centered on both new music and Beethoven.

City councillor =1989-1995= Prystanski was first elected to the Winnipeg City Council in the 1989 municipal election, defeating incumbent councillor Terry Wachniak. He was still in his mid-20s at the time of his first election, and worked with the City of Winnipeg streets and transportation department.\\"John Prystanski\\" [correction notice], 5 October 1995, A7. He was on the right-wing of council. He was appointed to the board of the Winnipeg Enterprises Corp. shortly after the election.William Neville, \\"Some arms are longer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 June 1993. Neville argued that Prystanski possessed no obvious qualifications for this position, and speculated that his appointment was at least partly due to his alliance with the centre-right. For a reference to Prystanski's age, see \\"Prystanski finds elders demand a little respect\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 May 1993. Re-elected in 1992, he was chosen over Glen Murray the following year to serve on Winnipeg's safe city committee. Some women's groups expressed concern that he was not sufficiently sensitive to their concerns.\\"First-graders' art decorates city hall\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 March 1993. He also chaired an ad hoc committee that sought to win tax credits for Winnipeg residents who renovate older homes.Dan Lett, \\"City backs tax credits for repairs\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 October 1993.

The following month, he and Glen Murray were the only two councillors to vote against spending $30,000 on a bid for the 1995 Grey Cup.Scott Taylor, \\"Council fumbles ball on sports\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 December 1993. Prystanski represented one of Winnipeg's lowest-income areas. In 1993, he called for a crackdown on prostitution through traffic restrictions and greater lighting.Teresa Crellin, \\"Prostitute problem on move: residents\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 September 1993. On another occasion, he described Winnipeg's licensing system as ineffective in cracking down on underage drinkers.Daniel McIntyre, \\"Club flouting law, councillor claims\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 May 1994. He helped establish the Westland Foundation in 1994, with the intent of providing funding for inner-city projects.\\"Foundation set up to support groups in the inner city\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 July 1994; \\"Foundation works behind scenes, keeps north end programs going\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 May 1997, p. 1. He supported the maintenance of historical sites in his ward, and angrily rejected Al Golden's suggestion that Point Douglas was too dangerous for municipal heritage projects.Nick Martin, \\"Restoration possible for historic site\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 June 1993. Prystanski also supported community policing, and threatened a crackdown on local flea markets in 1995.Paul McKie, \\"Military timing right on until Dumont's joyride\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 April 1995 [community policing]; Nick Martin, \\"Flea market operator\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 June 1995, p. 2.

He opposed extending municipal benefits to the partners of same-sex couples in 1994.Dan Lett, \\"Same-sex debate stews\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 July 1994.

He was chosen as deputy speaker of council shortly after the election.Stevens Wild, \\"Lines drawn at city hall\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 November 1995, A7.

In April 1996, he supported the contracting-out of transit services for persons with disabilities.Treena Khan, \\"Bus safety fears dismissed\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 April 1996, A6. Prystanski remained involved with several initiatives intended to address the poverty and challenging living conditions of his ward. He supported unsuccessful efforts to introduce a strict youth curfew.Treena Khan, \\"Councillors say no to curfew for youths\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 June 1996, A4; Aldo Santin, \\"Curfew call falls on deaf ears\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 June 1996, A6. In June 1996, he asked federal Justice Minister Allan Rock to introduce legislation allowing drivers to lose their cars if caught soliciting for prostitution.Treena Khan, \\"Green light sought to nab red-light car\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 June 1996, A7. Winnipeg police supported the proposal later in the year. See \\"Police target johns' cars\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 October 1996, A12.

He was also targeted by the Canadian Union of Public Employees.Bill Redekop, \\"Civic union puts out political wish list\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 October 1998, A3.

He again endorsed the mayoral candidacy of Peter Kaufmann, who was narrowly defeated by Glen Murray.David O'Brien, \\"Speaking your language\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 October 1998, A10.

The temple is famous for its bas-relief cavings on a cliff face. The honzon of the temple is a bas-relief stone statue of Senj≈´ Kannon. The temple is 19th stop on the Band≈ç Sanj≈´sankasho pilgrimage route of 33 temples sacred to Kannon in the Kant≈ç region. History The history and foundation of the temple is uncertain, but it appears to date from the late Nara period to early Heian period. The temple is located in a valley which contains the ruins of a J≈çmon period settlement. According to the temple's own legend, it was founded by K≈´kai in 810 AD after he returned from Tang Dynasty China. The temple became part of the Band≈ç Sanj≈´sankasho route in the Kamakura period. It was under the protection of the powerful Utsunomiya Futaarayama Jinja and the Utsunomiya clan through the Muromachi period. The temple was rebuilt in the early Edo period by Kamehime, the eldest daughter of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu, with the assistance of Tenkai as a resting place between Edo and the Shrines and Temples of Nikk≈ç. The temple has burned down on several occasions, and most of its documentary history has been lost. Its precincts were excavated in 1965, and Buddha statues from the Kamakura period, votive stones dated 1363, and a copper bowl dated 1551 were found. ≈åya Stone Buddhas The is a set of ten bas-relief carvings of various Buddhist divinities located on a cliff at ≈åya-dera. These carvings were designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1926 and reclassified as a Special National Historic Site in 1954. The carvings are located on the wall of a large natural cave on the southwestern side of a hill made of ≈åya stone called Otomeyama. The wall is divided into four large and small quadrants. In the first quadrant, facing west, is a statue of Senj≈´ Kannon with a height of four meters. This is the honzon image of the temple. According to temple legend, the statue was carved by K≈´kai himself, and was once covered by lacquer and gold leaf. In the second quadrant is a sitting image of Shaka Ny≈çrai with a height of 3.5 meters, flanked to the left and right by Monju Bosatsu and Fugen Bostasu. The statue in the third quadrant a sitting Yakushi Ny≈çrai with a height of 1.2 meters, flanked by Nikk≈ç Bosatsu and Gakk≈ç Bosatsu. The fourth quadrant is believed to be a seated Amida Ny≈çrai with a height of 2.6 meters, flanked by status of Kannon Bosatsu and Seishi Bosatsu. In addition, several sitting images depicted on the wall on the right side of the Kannon statue, and a statue of a Buddha above. The statues of Senj≈´ Kannon and Yakushi Ny≈çrai are believed to date from the early Heian period, with the statue of Shaka Ny≈çrai from the late Heian period, and the remaining statues from the late Heian to early Kamakura period. These statues are regarded as having extremely high artistic and academic value, along with the more famous Usuki Stone Buddhas in Oita Prefecture, and the carvings were also designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan in 1986. The temple complex also includes a small museum. Across from the temple is an ≈åya stone quarry that has been converted into a park. The park features a massive statue of Kannon, called the created after World War II.

Common names include sandplain gerardia and sandplain false foxglove. It is one of about 70 species that comprise genus Agalinis. It currently resides within the family Orobanchaceae, but historically was aligned with members of the Scrophulariaceae.USDA Plants Profile This was one of several re-alignments that were the consequence of the disintegration of the Scrophulariaceae as the result of conclusions based on molecular phylogeny data from the chloroplast genome. While historically regarded as a separate species, molecular phylogenetic data indicates that Agalinis acuta should be consolidated as part of the species Agalinis decemloba. Agalinis acuta received federal protection on public lands upon being listed as in 1987 under the Endangered Species Act.U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 1988. Determination of Agalinis acuta to be an endangered species. Federal Register 53:34701-34705. Threats to extinction mentioned in the report listing the species were those that are characteristics of most threatened species; habitat fragmentation, lack of regulatory mechanisms protecting the species, and overexploitation for commercial or academic purposes.Center for Plant Conservation This annual herb grows up to 35 or 40 centimeters tall. The leaves are linear in shape, up to 2.5 centimeters long and one millimeter wide. Flowers are borne on pedicels one or two centimeters long. Each flower has a hairy tubular calyx of sepals with triangular lobes. The flower corolla is up to 1.3 centimeters long with a tubular throat and rounded, notched lobes. It is pink with a red-spotted white throat. Flowers occur in late summer and early fall, and the flower withers after one day, often less than a full day.The Nature Conservancy The flowers are self-compatible. This plant occurs in sandy coastal plain habitat in poor, dry soils. It is a member of sandplain grassland communities and openings in coniferous forest. It thrives in areas that have been disturbed by processes such as grazing or fire, clearing out most other vegetation. Two populations grow in cemeteries that are constantly landscaped. There are 22 or 23 occurrences, the population numbers fluctuating year to year. The species is threatened by the loss of its habitat to development, and alteration of remaining habitat. The plant requires open space on clear ground, and it does not do well if litter and vegetation builds up or trees grow and form a shady canopy. Some populations of the plant are actually tended by allowing sheep to graze in their habitat.

It was originally used as a combination gymnasium and armory beginning in 1894. Designed in the Romanesque revival style, it resembles a red brick castle. It is situated on the shores of Lake Mendota, overlooking Library Mall, and adjacent to Memorial Union. History Around the time of the construction of the building, labor riots had occurred in a number of cities in the United States, including the Haymarket riot in Chicago in 1886. Leaders in many cities saw the need for local armories to be prepared for worker strikes and uprisings. Thus, when funding the building, the Wisconsin legislature clearly saw its use by local militia. The architects, Conover and Porter, designed it with a dual purpose in mind: armory and gymnasium. Modifications were made to the plans when a new university president, Charles Adams, insisted that the second floor be capable of accommodating large assemblies. Construction began in fall, 1892, and was completed in September, 1894. As originally constructed, the first floor of the Red Gym held military offices, an artillery drill room, bowling alleys, a locker room, and a swimming tank. The second floor contained a drill hall wide enough to permit a four-column battalion. The third floor was occupied by the gymnasium, which contained a baseball cage, gymnastic apparatus, and rowing machines. Two rifle ranges and a running track were on a level a few steps lower than the gym. Over the next 30 years, the second floor assembly hall was the scene of speeches by William McKinley (1894), William Jennings Bryan (1912), Eugene Debs (1923), Upton Sinclair (who in 1922 had to promise not to be controversial), and the Republican state conventions of 1902 and 1904, which nominated Robert M. La Follette for governor. The anti-military sentiment in Wisconsin that occurred after World War I resulted in the elimination of compulsory military training. The Red Gym was also no longer used for Big Ten basketball games following the construction of the university field house in 1930. In the 1930s and 1940s, much of the first and second floors was partitioned into offices. With diminishing use of the building after World War II, plans were made to demolish it; however, popular sentiment delayed those plans. When a new gym was constructed on the west end of campus in 1963, the building was again slated for demolition, and again received a reprieve. In the 1960s, it once again saw military use as ROTC headquarters. A firebomb aimed at the building by anti-war protesters in 1970 resulted in severe damage, which was repaired. Since then, the building has seen various administrative uses; it currently houses student services-related offices and centers. The University of Wisconsin Armory and Gymnasium was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. and Gallery Image:Old-red-gym.jpg File:The Red Gym from the Terrace.jpgThe Red Gym seen from the Memorial Union Terrace, 2008 File:00691 p 13ak4tgzph0688.jpgArmory, 1993 File:The_Wisconsin_blue_book_(1893)_(14591633800).jpgArmory, 1893 See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Wisconsin *National Register of Historic Places listings in Madison, Wisconsin References External links * The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Armory and Gymnasium, Wisconsin Historical Society * Gymnasium and Armory in The Buildings of the University of Wisconsin Category:Government buildings completed in 1894 Category:Infrastructure completed in 1894 Category:Buildings and structures in Madison, Wisconsin Category:Military facilities on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:National Historic Landmarks in Wisconsin Category:University and college buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Armory and Gymnasium Category:Wisconsin Badgers basketball venues Category:Armories on the National Register of Historic Places Category:National Register of Historic Places in Madison, Wisconsin Category:Historic district contributing properties in Wisconsin Category:Sports venues on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:1894 establishments in Wisconsin ","title":"University of Wisconsin Armory and Gymnasium"},{"id":"14962177","text":"The Iranian National Museum of Medical Sciences History is the first medical museum established in Iran by a joint project between the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences, and Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

It is endemic to the Philippines. The vine is common to Apayao, La Union, Rizal, Bataan, Laguna, Mindoro, Palawan, Negros, Panay, and Leyte. Description Hoya meliflua has stiff succulent leaves with a very clean look to them with no venation. The flowers are reddish orange and have nectaries near the base of the central column from which a dark sap is produced that stains very easily. In fact, its name is derived from the word \\"mellis\\" meaning honeydew and the word \\"fluo\\" meaning flow, referring to the dark nectar of the plant that stains the flowers. The plant flowers in June in the Philippines and each flower cluster comes with 10-20 flowers. ;Subspecies There is also a subspecies, Hoya meliflua ssp. fraterna, that has longer, narrower leaves. Discovery Hoya meliflua was first described in 1837 by Francisco Manuel Blanco, who mistakenly identified it as a Stapelia. He called it Stapelia meliflua. Hoya meliflua was originally found on the island of Luzon and so it was given the synonym Hoya luzonica by Rudolf Schlechter in 1905. Elmer Drew Merrill subsequently identified it as a Hoya, not Stapelia, and published it in Sp. Blancoanae 318 (1918) naming it Hoya meliflua. There are several other synonyms for Hoya meliflua including Hoya carnosa named by Blanco in 1845, Hoya Diversifolia by Fernandez in 1880, and Hoya parasitica by Fernandez in 1880. These synonyms were found to be invalid under Article 53.1 of international nomenclature. Hoya meliflua is very similar to Hoya fraterna and is sometimes called 'the little fraterna'.

Relationship A$ millions) since 1988 A$ millions) since 1988 The legacy of Australian involvement on French soil in the First and Second World Wars plays an important role in the bilateral relationship. Over 45,000 Australians lost their lives on French soil in the two conflicts. Each year many Australians travel to the Western Front to commemorate the thousands of Australians who were killed and injured there in World War I. Dialogue and practical cooperation between France and Australia has been strengthening on many fronts in recent years, including on key global security issues such as arms control and disarmament, non- proliferation and counter-terrorism. The Pacific region, where both countries have direct interests, continues to be an important focus of bilateral engagement. Commercial links are substantial and France is an increasingly important source of direct investment and technology, including in the defence sector, for Australia. Cooperation in the surveillance of valuable fisheries resources is also an area of ongoing bilateral activity. There has been an expansion of the defence relationship between Australia and France in recent years. On 14 December 2006 a new Defence Cooperation Agreement between the two countries was signed, providing a framework for further cooperation. Australia and France regularly participate in combined force training exercises and France provided support to the Australian-led INTERFET operations in East Timor. Australian and French forces have co-operated in the Pacific and Southern Oceans, including for emergency and disaster relief and operations against illegal fishing. Australia and France have also cooperated at various levels in the coalition against terrorism, including as founding members of the Proliferation Security Initiative to combat the trafficking in weapons of mass destruction. In 2008, it was announced that France and Australia would strengthen their defence cooperation further in the Pacific region.\\"Australia & France to increase defence ties in the Pacific\\", ABC Radio Australia, 17 September 2008 Australia and France have a dynamic relationship in all fields of the arts, with Australian artists enthusiastic to work within the French cultural tradition, and many French counterparts keen to explore Australia's vibrant younger culture. Institutional links are encouraged within the framework of the 1977 Australia‚ÄìFrance Agreement on Cultural and Scientific Cooperation. The Australian Embassy in Paris administers the Australia‚ÄìFrance Foundation, which promotes cultural exchanges between the two countries and publishes a quarterly newsletter 'L'Australie en France' promoting Australian activities in France. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Cultural Awards Scheme has also promoted cultural relations between Australia and France. Australia has made a significant contribution to the Mus√©e du quai Branly, a major international museum dedicated to the world's indigenous arts and cultures that opened in Paris in June 2006. A permanent installation of works by eight Australian Indigenous artists commissioned by the Australian Government has been incorporated into the structure of one of the main buildings of the museum. Short-term visitors arriving in Australia from France since 1991 (monthly). Tourist links between the two countries are significant, with over 400,000 Australians visiting France each year. Almost 98,000 visitor visas were granted to French nationals to visit Australia in 2005‚Äì06, making France the 10th largest source of visitor visa grants, and 1,867 student visas were granted. A working holiday-maker agreement signed between the two countries in November 2003 makes it easier for young French and Australian people to spend time in each other's countries. In 2005‚Äì06, 6,126 Australian working holiday visas were granted to French nationals, making France the 7th largest source of working holiday visitors, and 483 were granted to Australians. Australia and France have maritime borders between their territories. The locations of these boundaries were formalised through the Australia‚ÄìFrance Marine Delimitation Agreement which came into effect on 10 January 1983. In August 2009, Nicolas Sarkozy became the first serving French leader to visit Australia.\\"President Sarkozy to make history on visit to Australia\\", The Times, 26 May 2009 The Courier Mail reported that \\"serious bilateral issues\\" for Sarkozy and Kevin Rudd to discuss included \\"the war in Afghanistan and global warming\\".\\"French President Nicolas Sarkozy to visit Australia\\", Courier Mail, 24 May 2009 Fran√ßois Hollande visited Canberra in November 2014 after the G20 Summit in Brisbane. Meeting with Tony Abbott, Hollande reinforced the strong bonds forged between the two nations in both world wars, stating that \\"we will have an opportunity to recognise the sacrifice of Australian soldiers who came to save France twice, and we will never forget this.\\" In April 2016, the Australian Government decided to purchase a conventional variant of the Barracuda-class nuclear submarine designed by DCNS to replace its Collins-class diesel-electric submarines currently in service. Twelve submarines will be constructed in Adelaide by ASC Pty Ltd and will cost in excess of A$50 billion. Admiral :fr:Christophe Prazuck, Chief of the French Navy, stated after the deal was completed that Australia was 'one of the French navy's four main partners along with the US, UK and Germany'. During a 2018 visit to Australia, President Emmanuel Macron stated his desire to create a strategic alliance between France, Australia and India, in the Indo-Pacific region. French influence on Australia Some of France's strongest cultural influences on Australia have been in the fields of viticulture (wine-making) and cheese-making. In the field of painting, Australian impressionism was marginally influenced by the French movement. More significantly, Australian painters of the 19th century were influenced by the French en plein air practices. French music and chanson has had little influence on Australian music styles, despite the success of Australian musicians David Lewis (a member of the Paris Combo) and Tina Arena in France. Likewise, Australian filmmakers have not readily adopted French cinematic styles such as nouvelle vague. French novelists have had little impact in Australia, partly due to delays in their works being translated. Avante-garde movements like the nouveau roman were never popular in Australia. More often, 19th century authors such as Jules Verne and Victor Hugo have proven more popular. French philosophers and psychoanalysts such as Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, F√©lix Guattari. Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault have had a significant impact on cultural studies departments of Australian universities, albeit they are invariably filtered heavily through American and Jewish academic influences first. More often than not, these academics' theories are applied in ways they have not been in France. For instance, Derrida and Lacan's theories have been used in Australian universities' literature departments more often than they have in the academics' actual fields of study, most often with very eccentric results. Politically, the relationship between France and Australia has remained strong throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Public sentiment took a dive, however, in the 1970s during the French nuclear testing in the Pacific on Moruroa. During this period, there was a boycott of French wines, French restaurants and other things associated with France, such as items on menus. There was also a union ban on mail to France. Another strain in the relationship took place following the French sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, the Greenpeace boat, in New Zealand in the 1980s. French is still one of the most commonly taught foreign languages at Australian high schools, though, as an optional course, very few students continue to study it through to completion. Thus, it is rare to find people who are truly fluent in the language. Telopea Park School, an Australian public school, recognised and supported by the French government, is a unique education partnership in Australia. There has been a strong growth over the past five years in audiences in Australia for French films, with more than 1.3 million admissions in 2010, as compared to less than 500,000 in 2005. French films are the fourth most popular, preceded only by English language films from the USA, UK and Australia. Each year, around forty French films are sold to Australian distributors for commercial release, not including films released on DVD. SBS buys the rights to distribute over 70 French films annually for broadcast on free-to-air TV, and generally screens one or two French films per week. The Alliance Fran√ßaise French Film Festival is an annual event jointly organised by the Alliance Fran√ßaises of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Perth and Adelaide and is supported by the French Embassy. Treaties A significant number of Australia‚ÄìFrance bilateral treaties include: treaties concerning the war and its aftermath, science, defence, taxation, trade, extradition, and the Antarctic. The recent purchase of submarines from France is also part of a treaty.

During World War II, the shipyard was involved in repairing warships and producing turret artillery units and mine- sweeping equipment. Also during the war years the enterprise built large mine hunters, destroyers, diesel-electric submarines, ferries, lighters, floating repair barges, while repairing both Northern Fleet surface ships as well as vessels delivering supplies via the Arctic Convoys. By 1950 the shipyard had repaired 139 ships and vessels. In the early 1950s, large-scale production of submarines was launched. In 1969, the company produced world's first nuclear submarine with a titanium alloy hull, Project 661. In the mid-1970s, its facilities underwent major reconstruction; its industrial capacity was doubled and it had Russia's largest covered slipway installed. The Typhoon class nuclear submarine cruiser Project 941, built in 1981, entered the Guinness World Records as the world's biggest submarine.

She was the daughter of the first President of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, and his wife Grace Wahu. She served as the Mayor of Nairobi from 1970 to 1976 and as Kenya's Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1976 to 1986.. She was thereafter appointed as a Commissioner with the Electoral Commission of Kenya from 1992 to 2002.  Early life  Margaret Kenyatta was born in Pumwani Maternity Hospital in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, to Jomo Kenyatta, a Kenyan politician who later became Kenya's first president, and his first wife Grace Wahu. She was one of two children born to Kenyatta and Wahu, after elder brother Peter Muigai. By the time Margaret was born, her father was already a political activist. He was the Secretary General of the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA) that had been formed to fight for the return of African lands that had been forcefully taken by the colonialists. In 1929, when she was barely a year old, her father left for England to represent KCA in these discussions. He returned home the following year but returned in 1931 to England and Russia for further studies. With her father away, Margaret grew up and lived with her mother and her older brother Peter in their family home in Gichungo near Dagoretti Children's Centre in Nairobi. As was the custom in those days, Margaret helped her mother in day to day chores of their home. She was an obedient, extremely neat and a very inquisitive child who asked her mother many questions about her father and why he had left and gone to England. Even before she started school, she had developed a sharp mind and had started to become aware of the colonial injustices of the time.  Education  In those days, few children went to school early therefore Margaret only joined formal school at Ruthimitu Primary School when she was over ten years old. She later attended the Church of Scotland Mission School at Thogoto, Kikuyu, where, true to her natural leadership skills, she became one of the prefects of the girls‚Äô section. Margaret passed the primary school leaving examinations with flying colours and the examination officials had a serious challenge over what to do with her and another girl, Joan Wambui Gitau, who had also passed well, for high school studies. The dilemma was that there was no high school for African girls at the time. However, due to their strong academic performance, the Principal of the then Alliance High School Kikuyu (now Alliance Boys High School) had no option but to accept the girls to join the school. Margaret was therefore the first girl to enroll at Alliance in 1948 with admission number ‚Äò1000‚Äô. This number was given to her to distinguish her admission to the school as the first girl, since admission number ‚Äò1‚Äô had been given to her uncle James Muigai when he had joined the same school twenty years earlier. Margaret and Joan became lasting role models to girls during their two years at Alliance. This continued even after they went in different directions after sitting for the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Schools Examination in 1949 and passing well; Margaret going on to teach at the Kenya Teachers‚Äô Training College at Githunguri, Kiambu, and Joan to study at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.  Teaching Life  From 1949 to 1952, Margaret taught at the Kenya Teachers‚Äô Training College at Githunguri, Kiambu, where her father had become the Principal in 1946 after returning from England. It is noteworthy that Margaret taught without any salary. She stopped teaching when the African Independent Schools were closed by the colonial government after a State of Emergency was declared in Kenya in 1952. It was while teaching at Githunguri that Margaret's political consciousness was awakened because she was constantly in contact with those at the forefront of the freedom struggle. She spent a lot of time with her father, who instilled in her the spirit of fighting for African rights, and made a decision to be part of the freedom struggle by supporting her father and those who were at the forefront of the freedom struggle.  State of Emergency & Early Working Life  When her father was arrested and jailed on 20 October 1952 after the declaration of the State of Emergency, Margaret was the source of information for her father through the numerous personal letters that she wrote to him. Because letters were censored, the content of the letters was mainly news of the family. He also wrote her letters including stories of what was happening in Lokitaung to the Drum magazine, which supported Kenya's independence struggle at the time. Margaret also visited her father in Maralal, which involved tiring and hazardous journeys on the back of a truck for several days. During her father's trial in Kapenguria, she assisted the lawyers in preparing and signing the necessary legal documents. She also arranged for him to obtain the vital vitamin tablets and medication for eczema he required as well as the necessary doctors to attend to his health during his detention. While her father and elder brother Peter Muigai were in detention, the responsibility of providing for the families they left behind fell on her and she had to seek employment to provide for them. Margaret came back to Nairobi to search for employment and stayed at House No. 27 of Kariokor Estate, from where she managed to make occasional visits to her mother and young son in Dagoretti despite the severe travel restrictions then in place in Nairobi. Margaret managed to secure employment in various jobs between the years 1953 and 1960; as a telephone operator at the East Africa Bata Shoe Company, later as a junior accounts clerk, and also as a book binder in a publishing firm owned by the renowned Asian nationalist Mr. Ambu H. Patel, who supported the freedom movement. Mr. Patel allowed her to travel several times to visit her father while he was in detention. Margaret also joined and played an active role in a number of social welfare organisations dealing with women and general matters during this period. While she was employed, she went by the name Margaret Kamau to conceal the fact that she was the daughter of Jomo Kenyatta due to the inherent dangers of an association with that name during the Emergency period. When Mzee Kenyatta was released in August 1961, Margaret became his secretary and close confidant, always standing by his side and taking notes whenever he addressed the press.  Early Political Life  Margaret's political life was awakened at an early stage when her father came back to Kenya from England in 1946. She saw how her father related with people and explained to them the meaning of freedom. He toured the country with her, attending the various political meetings he held in different parts of Kenya. When the Peoples Convention Party was formed in 1956, it was natural that she became a member of the party as it was the most active political party during the period of the State of Emergency that was fighting for the African rights and the release of political detainees. Margaret thereafter joined the Kenya African National Union (KANU) when it was formed in 1960, working at the Kiambu Branch as its first Assistant Secretary and later as the Secretary of the Branch until 1962. She was also active in the KANU Women's Wing at both the branch and national level and became a County Councillor in Kiambu during that period. She travelled extensively overseas and visited countries in Africa, Europe, Asia and America, which travels also included visits to the then U.S.S.R (now the Russian Federation) and the People's Republic of China promoting the Kenyan freedom cause. She was also a member of various Party and Government delegations to other countries, including to the United Nations.  Women Advocacy  Margaret was very passionate about women's issues. She was committed to improving the lives of women, especially their rights and increasing their voice to be heard, and was deeply involved in the movement to find the rightful role of women in an independent state. In 1962, Margaret became the Chairlady of the Kenya Women Seminar, and, together with prominent East African women including Bibi Titi Mohamed of Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and Pumla Kisosonkole of Uganda, was among the convenors of the East African Women Seminars in 1962 and 1963. These seminars brought together East African women leaders to discuss their role as women in the economic and political development of their young nations. She was actively involved in the national women's associations of the day, including Maendeleo ya Wanawake and the National Council of Women of Kenya, and utilized her contacts with international movements such as Countrywomen of the World, International Council of Women, Women Presbyterians of Canada, and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). These organizations united women of different races and religious inclinations to combine their efforts to advance the cause of girls and women. In 1964, she became the President of the National Council of Women of Kenya and began to travel widely, addressing conferences and seminars throughout the world on women's roles in nation-building. She attended Women's International Conferences in Vienna in 1962, Washington in 1963, Israel in 1964 and London in 1965. Speaking to groups in Europe, Asia, America, the U.S.S.R., the People's Republic of China and India, her message always emphasized the importance of the home and children, and the place of education in building a solid future. In 1964, in recognition of her efforts, she was awarded the Order of the Queen of Sheba by Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia. She continued her efforts to unify women in a quest for equality and was a great inspiration to girls and women, insisting that girls needed to get an education in order to assume leadership in independent Kenya. Margaret's strident defence and support of women's empowerment was also evidenced when she was appointed by President Jomo Kenyatta in 1967 as a member of the Commission on the Law of Marriage and Divorce to consider the existing laws relating to marriage and divorce in Kenya and to make recommendations for a new law providing a comprehensive and uniform law of marriage and divorce applicable to all persons in Kenya, paying particular attention to the status of women in relation to marriage and divorce in a free democratic society.  Nairobi City Council & Mayor of Nairobi  Margaret was elected as a Councillor for Dagoretti Ward in Nairobi in 1963 and was subsequently re- elected for four subsequent terms. During her tenure as a Councillor the Nairobi City Council, she played a prominent role in the administration of public health in the city. She was the Chairlady of the Pumwani Maternity Hospital Sub-committee during the reconstruction and extension of the Hospital and also a Chairwoman of the Public Health Committee. Margaret was elected as the deputy Mayor of Nairobi in 1969 and as the Mayor of Nairobi for two terms from 1970 to 1976, thus becoming the first African woman to become the mayor of Kenya's capital city and the second African woman mayor in Kenya. Her tenure in office was marked by the adoption of high standards that uplifted Nairobi into one of the leading cities in the world through the implementation of many developmental programs including the construction of the Jamuhuri, California, Kariobangi South, Buru Buru and Madaraka housing estates, the first housing estates of their kind in East Africa. She also oversaw the expansion of the roads and sewerage services and public health facilities. It was evidence of these high standards that tap water in Nairobi was among the cleanest water that could be drunk in the world during that period. Margaret's first priorities during her tenure as Mayor, however, remained women, children, and education, which she viewed as the hope for Kenya's future. Her tenure is remembered with nostalgia for her exceptional leadership, especially in her willingness to uplift other women, mentor them and to travel widely to inspire girls in schools. She would lend her powerful voice to all decisions affecting the empowerment of girls and women. In 1972 she visited Austria and convinced the Austrian President to open the SOS Children's Homes in Kenya, which continue to impact many lives of the less privileged in Kenyan society.  United Nations Activities & Permanent Representative to the United Nations Programme on Environment (UNEP)  Margaret was involved in various United Nations activities in the 1960s, attending the UNESCO Seminar on Women Education held in Moscow in 1962 and as a Kenyan delegate to the 20th Session of the United Nations in December 1965. In 1976, Margaret was appointed as Kenya's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), where she represented Kenya in the UNEP Governing Council, a position in which she served until 1986. She is remembered for spearheading the fight against desertification in Kenya during her tenure. In 1985, President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi appointed Margaret as the head of the Kenyan delegation to the United Nations Third World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade of Women (1976 ‚Äì 1986) held in Nairobi, Kenya in July 1985, which was attended by the then United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. The Conference was the culmination of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality, Development and Peace from 1976 to 1986 and oversaw the adoption of the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women. 157 Governments were represented at the Nairobi Conference, along with intergovernmental organizations, United Nations bodies and agencies, non-governmental organizations and national liberation movements. More than 80 per cent of the 2,000 delegates were women, and women headed approximately 85 per cent of the delegations. The Decade's themes‚Äîequality, development and peace‚Äîand sub-themes‚Äîeducation, health and employment‚Äîwere reiterated throughout the work of the Conference and provided the outline for its main document, the \\"Forward-looking strategies of implementation for the advancement of women and concrete measures to overcome obstacles to the achievement of the goals and objectives of the Decade\\", covering the period from 1986 to 2000. Margaret was elected by acclamation as the President of the Conference, telling the assemblage that the international community must not be overly confident of the successes of the Decade, but must look critically at what remains to be done and devise appropriate ways to resolve outstanding issues. If the Conference were not a success, she stated, it would \\"let down the world community of women and the international community as a whole\\". Margaret also participated as a member of the Kenyan delegation to the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace in Beijing, China in September 1995. The principal themes of this Conference were the advancement and empowerment of women in relation to women's human rights, women and poverty, women and decision-making, the girl-child, violence against women and other areas of concern, aiming at accelerating the implementation of the Nairobi Forward- Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women.  Electoral Commission of Kenya  Margaret was appointed as a member of the Electoral Commission of Kenya by President Moi from 1992 to 2002. During her term as a Commissioner, she was involved in the Commission's activities in the organization of the General Elections in Kenya in 1992, 1997 and 2002, a position in which she served with distinction. At the end of her tenure as a Commissioner in 2002, she retired from public service to a quiet life.  Social Memberships  Margaret was a member of the Green Belt Movement, Young Women's Christian Association (Y.W.C.A.), the Kenya Girl Guide Association, the Kenya Red Cross Society, the National Council of Social Services, HelpAge Kenya and the National Council of Women, of which she was the President for three years. She was also the Chairlady of the Kenyatta National Hospital League of Friends. Margaret also took a keen interest in education and sat on the Boards of Governors of various educational institutions including the Kiambu Institute of Technology (KIST) from 1971 to 2009 and the Kenya High School from 1977 to 2006. She was also instrumental in the founding of the Starehe Girls' Centre, a national boarding school in Kenya that offers secondary education to financially disadvantaged girls from all over the country, in January 2005. Girl Guide Movement Margaret joined the Kenya Girl Guide Movement in the early 1940s and became the first warranted African Girl Guide in Kenya in 1949. She was the Chairlady of the Trefoil Senior Girl Guide Guild and member of the National Council for 10 years and gave the keynote speech at the International Federation of Scouts and Girl Guides meeting in Nyeri in 2007 to celebrate 100 years of the Scout movement in Kenya. She was committed to promoting the social values and empowerment of girls and women and supported the Kenya Girl Guides Association in developing suitable programs for the girls, the core of the Guides‚Äô law and Promise.  Awards and Honours  In recognition of her contribution to the promotion of environmental awareness, education and development, Margaret was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Environmental Science by the Kenyatta University at its 10th congregation in 1995. In 2001, the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts presented Margaret with an award for ‚ÄòLeadership Excellence in Africa‚Äô in Cape Town, South Africa following her nomination for the award by the African Girl Guide and Girl Scout national associations. Margaret was also awarded the ‚ÄòFreedom of the City‚Äô by the Nairobi City Council in 2006 in recognition of her service to the city of Nairobi as a Councillor and Mayor.  Family  Margaret was the mother to the late Hon. Justice Patrick John Kamau (1951 - 2005), Judge of the High Court of Kenya. She was a half-sister to the current President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta.  Religion  Margaret was a member of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) and was a parishioner at the PCEA St. Andrews Church in Nairobi.  Death  Margaret passed away peacefully at her home in Lavington, Nairobi on 5 April 2017 at the age of 89.

Kenton, 2019. But looking at physical exchange of goods/services, this model dates back to before modern transportation and electricity. People back then consumed mostly locally due to large geographical distances, which they could overcome either on foot or by horse, but both usually took them days. Therefore, they established relationships with closest goods and service providers and this is how Direct-to-consumer model first looked like. If we look, for instance, at the farmers as a business, it could be argued that they had a small but loyal pool of customers and operated on a small scale. The relationships were tight and healthy, because the switching costs for customers were pretty high, as said, due to geographical barriers and small number of competitors. Furthermore, there was much more space for personalization of business processes as farmers (among others, such as shoe repair master) knew exactly who their customers were and what they wanted. But as various faster modes of transport emerged and as villages expanded to cities, everything became much more interconnected. Before that, customers didn‚Äôt think about buying from businesses from distant foreign villages but later started to think about what pays off more to them, especially if local food/service providers thought their businesses cannot be disrupted by no one else and dropped their guard. Consumers asked themselves whether costs of buying locally are still so much lower then the costs of buying from a foreign farmer with better food. They asked themselves whether it is not worth spending additional resources on transport to get their shoes fixed so that they last long without tearing apart, compared to fixing them every other month at local shoe repair? This is how Direct-to-consumer model eventually became much more dynamic and wider. As cities continued to spread and as new modes of transport kept emerging (steamboat, first cars, trains ‚Ä¶), plus taking into account expansion of road infrastructure and inventions such as electricity and everything that came after it, consumers were able to choose among wide variety of goods and service providers, most of which they could reach with way lower costs than before. Respectively, the relationships between business and consumer changed. They were not based on personal ties between the two, but rather on characteristics of transaction and what it meant to each of the parties (quality and/or convenience of the good/service for customer and profit and/or good word for the business). This means that a citizen who haven‚Äôt had his/her hair cut in months, won‚Äôt go to one particular barber just because he/she knows him and wants to boost his/her business, but more because of the quality of the service he/she provides. With the passage of time, internet emerged and disrupted the Direct-to-consumer model severely. Many different types of goods and services were now not few blocks or kilometers away, but rather few mouse clicks. Additionally, the number of the same product/service providers increased even more, making the differences in their performances narrower. Now, the businesses had to put additional effort to win customers, who had power in their hands and to whom businesses had to adapt even more. Extra effort was needed on the field of marketing (consumer/market analysis, reshaping of 4P‚Äôs, etc.), CRM and so forth, to stand out from competition and secure as much sales as needed to keep the business alive, as switching costs for consumers have reached all-time low. This is how Direct-to-consumer model slowly acquired shape that we know today.The Evolution of the Direct-to-consumer Relationship Second to none, 2020 Advantages and disadvantages  The principle advantage of Direct-to- consumer is its focus on customers, which provides stronger brand loyalty. Good relations with the customers are a necessity in this situation and bring more loyal customers and keep a high retention level.Business-to-Consumer (Direct-to-consumer), May 20, 2019 Direct-to-consumer enjoys lower costs compared to physical retail, as it has reduced the number of different business components like employees, purchasing cost, mailing confirmation, renting or establishing a physical store. Advantages and disadvantages of Direct-to-consumer Study for Business, October 15, 2018 A Direct-to-consumer model reaches a huge worldwide audience more easily and takes advantage of an unlimited marketplace.Advantages and disadvantages of B2B and Direct-to- consumer Solwin Infotech, 2019 This concept sells the products directly to the customers without the need for intermediaries and by that remove third party clients in the middle of the process. More, it made business administration easier, without complicated recording of inventory, shipments or business transactions. It also enables smaller companies to become competitive with successful and large companies as well as grow faster through this model. They can be competitive in terms of price, availability of the products and quality since costs are lower. Advantages and disadvantages of Direct-to-consumer Study for Business, October 15, 2018 The main risks in the online Direct-to-consumer are expanding liability risk, cyber risk and more complex supply chain. Firstly, selling directly to customers exposes a business to risks that are previously or normally bore by distributors such as wholesalers and retailers. For instance, the business has to concern themselves with shipping, labelling, or cybersecurity. The latter is one of the main risks of running a Direct-to-consumer ecommerce firm, due to the sensitivity of handling consumers‚Äô data. Data privacy and security became one of the priorities, especially in online businesses. The main concern is not only higher exposure to security breaches but problems such as selling personal data etc. Finally, conducting e-commerce Direct-to-consumer business increases the complexity of the supply chain itself, which might pose additional difficulties for the firm itself. For example, changing business from B2B to Direct-to-consumer means that instead of selling to only a few distributors you now have to sell the products to many individual customers. This means that the company is now in charge of delivering products to their customers' doorsteps which increases the complexity of the distribution chain and poses additional risks. The Benefits and Risks of Direct-to-Consumer Strategies in Manufacturing, June 8, 2020 Direct-to-consumer model in practise The Direct-to-consumer business model can be applied in many different ways, for instance, the entire company or just some product lines can adopt such a model. An example of such a company is Away, an e-commerce company that produces expensive travel accessories and was valued at 1.4$bn in 2019. Their main product, sold mainly online and in some brick and mortar stores, are high-end suitcases. In 2015 they sold more than 300,000 suitcases at lower prices than their competition due to the adoption of Direct-to- consumer business model. Besides that, Away's success can be credited to their deep understanding of their customers as travellers.Direct-to-Consumer Selling: 5 DTC Brand Examples You Need to Know, June 8, 2020 Secondly, only one product line can adopt the Direct-to-consumer business model, for instance Seventh generation adopted such a model. This company is now a part of the Unilever and are offering a wide array of different personal care products. Although the company is not entirely Direct-to-consumer they offer a line of feminine hygiene products directly to consumers and are thus improving their experience. They offer the customization of monthly subscription of the previously mentioned product. Initially the buyers solve a quiz, by which the Seventh generation than tailors the monthly box to buyers needs. Furthermore, another Unilever's subsidiary adopted such a Direct-to-consumer business model. Maille has been selling its mustard products through retailers since 1723 but after the acquiring of Unilever, they have started to sell directly through their website.Direct-to-Consumer Ecommerce: Data, Benefits & 12 Enterprise Examples June 8, 2020 See also *Consumer-to-business References Category:Business terms Category:Retailing Category:Marketing strategy Category:Merchandising ","title":"Direct-to-consumer"},{"id":"14962756","text":"Watson is an unincorporated community in Utica Township, Clark County, Indiana.

The station was designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin, and consists of two historic buildings. The passenger station is a one-story common-bond brick structure with a gable roof. It is nearly identical in plan and dimensions to the Laurel, Maryland station Baldwin designed, also built in 1884, although the rooflines and settings are quite different. About 90 feet to the east of the station is the freight shed or loading dock, a brick structure about 45 ft √ó 20 ft. Its north and south facades are divided into six panels with a door in the second and fifth bays on both sides. The station was extended to the east in 1905.

Built in 1897, the building played an important role in the field of dairy science during the 20th century. It has been used both as a teaching facility and as a site for agricultural research. It is significant for its association with the single-grain experiment, performed from 1907 to 1911 by Stephen Babcock. The UW Dairy Barn was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Architecture The Dairy Barn is a complex of six attached buildings. The main dairy barn fronts the complex along Linden Avenue and is . A trio of buildings is attached at the rear (south): a young livestock barn on the west, a classroom and stock judging area in the center, and a cow barn on the east. Also attached to the barn is a litter shed, a milk shed, and a livestock barn. Tracks from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad run just to the south of the complex. History The University of Wisconsin College of Agriculture was founded in 1889. Founding dean William Arnon Henry moved the program from South Hall onto its own, four-building campus. Henry became a leading researcher and writer on feeding livestock, especially after the 1898 publication of his Feeds and Feeding. Stephen Moulton Babcock, the department chair of agricultural chemistry, convinced Henry to build a station to study cattle feeding. Initially, Henry refused because he did not believe a chemist could appropriately study the field. Babcock continued to petition the university for the building and finally animal husbandman W. L. Carlyle agreed in 1897. Carlyle and Babcock set up an experiment testing if salt was required in a dairy cow's diet. When one of their eight salt-deprived cows died, the experiment was halted. In 1901, Henry consented to allow Babcock to oversee an experiment comparing feed types, though he limited it to two animals and the experiment had inconclusive results. In 1907, after establishing a long-term testing plan, Babcock started the single-grain experiment. Cattle received rations from a single plant, though they were balanced so that each animal received sufficient nutrients. By the time the experiment ended in 1911, it was clear that the corn-fed group was significantly healthier than those fed oats, wheat, or a mixture of the three. The study was published that June and catalyzed the international study of nutrition. Other important studies conducted in the barn complex was the selective breeding experiment of the early 20th century, artificial insemination projects in the 1930s, and gonadotropic hormone studies in the 1940s.

It is registered with the National Trust of Australia as an area of heritage significance. History =Creation of the pool= Italian Archimede \\"Archie\\" Fontanini arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia in 1904. He worked for a timber sawmill at Greenbushes for three years, then decided to move near Bridgetown to become a farmer. Fontanini bought of land in what was known locally as \\"Archie's Oven Gulley\\" in 1907. He cleared the land and planted and harvested apples and various vegetables. The water in the front of the house was used to grow heavy crops, and Fontanini decided to rest the land by damming the stream with a large log and earth. He believed this would settle the silt in the water and improve the land's fertility. Fontanini and his wife had five children, who swam regularly in the dam he created. The dam became popular with other children and adults as the district of Manjimup and timber town of Deanmill expanded. There was no public pool in Manjimup, and Fontanini was encouraged to keep the dam and charge an entry fee. This he did, and he constructed facilities, cemented the dam walls and floor and developed the surrounding gardens with little mechanical assistance. =Open to the public= Fonty's Pool in 1950. The pool was officially opened to the public in 1925. On Australia Day, 1947, a log chop was held as part of an Australia Day Sports carnival. This was held annually for eleven years. In 1950, Fontanini retired from farming to work full-time on managing the pool and gardens. Fonty's Pool received thousands of visitors each year, and the swimming lessons were very popular. Fontanini was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire and received a Queen's honour for his contribution to the community and tourist industry in 1970. Fontanini closed the pool to the public in 1973, because the management burden was too great. Community support saw the pool reopened in 1979 with the Australia Day Log Chops and Swimming Carnival, in celebration of Western Australia's 150th anniversary. Some 12,000 people attended the carnival. Fontanini was present at the celebration. He died in 1982. Today Public liability insurance issues led to the closure of Fonty's Pool in 2005, when its insurance policy was revoked. The Fontanini family sold the farm shortly afterwards. The new owners, with assistance from the National Trust of Australia, reopened the pool with a 300-metre fence around the perimeter to meet insurance requirements. The Shire of Manjimup celebrated its centenary on Australia Day 2008 with a \\"Back to Fonty's\\" event. The celebration included swimming races, a bathtub race and a log chop competition. Part of Fontanini's original farm now houses a winery called Fonty's Pool Wines, which is adjacent to the pool on Seven Day Road. The 330 hectare winery, established in 1989, also produces avocados and truffles. Fonty's Pool holds 18 million litres of water, with a winter flow rate of 44,000 litres per hour. The pool covers nearly one acre.

It is alleged by critics, including former vice-president Oginga Odinga in his book Not Yet Uhuru, to have been coined by European settlers in Kenya's White Highlands region, around the time of independence in 1963, who preferred to retain an autonomous, ethnically-based governance over the region. It has also been alleged, by some of its critics, that majimbo is a pretext for the type of communal violence that has plagued Kenya's elections especially since the return of multiparty politics. In his auto biography titled Illusions of Power, one G.G Kariuki, a long serving KANU Member of Parliament, goes as far as to allege the existence of a plot to instigate communal violence in Kenya's independence elections by supporters of a Majimbo system of government. Independence-era The original plan, as created by Wilfred Havelock, Michael Blundell, and R. S. Alexander, would have created three autonomous, self-governing regions (Rift Valley, Western and Coast) in Kenya, which would share governance of the country based upon the mandate of the regional governments. This way, The Kikuyu and Luo people would each receive their own majority-ethnic governments and would negotiate with each other and with the other region for the creation and execution of any law on the national level. This was assumed as reasonable because of the fear that tribalist politics between the Kikuyu and Luo under a Westminster system would have been damaging for the other ethnic minorities in Kenya, including the European settlers and Asian residents. It became a part of the party platform for Ronald Ngala's KADU, which competed in the first post-independence elections against Jomo Kenyatta's nationalist Kenya African National Union party. In the Lancaster house constitutional conferences, Ngala's K.A.D.U delegation managed to negotiate the adoption of Federal system of governance based on 8 autonomous regions based on Kenya's provinces. However amendments to Kenya's constitution meant by 1970 Kenya had reverted to being a unitary state. Moi-era and post-Moi usage At one point during his presidency, Daniel arap Moi is alleged to have favoured the idea of majimbo for the regions. The communal violence allegedly organised by the Youth for Kanu '92 lobby group, which broke out during the 1992 general election, featured rhetoric identifiable with a more violent interpretation of the Majimbo advocating for the mass relocation of Kenyans to their respective tribes' ancestral homelands.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-26955035.htmlhttp://nigeria.codewit.com/africa/a-history- of-violence-392/kanu-youth-92-kalenjin-warriors-and-mayhem. A History of Violence -KANU Youth'92, Kalenjin Warriors and... However, since the end of his government, he is known to have denounced the idea. =2007 Election= Both the Orange Democratic Movement, under Raila Odinga, and the ODM-K, under Kalonzo Musyoka, had also endorsed a plan of ethnoregional decentralisation, as had the Shirikisho Party, which was part of the Party of National Unity, as part of their platforms for the 2007 Kenyan elections. Under Raila's majimbo plan, which followed the Bomas draft of the proposed constitution of 2004, the nation would be divided into 13 regions, which in turn would be divided into a number of districts. Each district will have an elected government, a budget and a parliament. The central government would be in charge of national institutions like armed forces, universities, national hospitals and highways. The plan, however, became a central point of opposition against Raila's and Musyoka's campaigns for the presidency, as it was seen by the PNU, and as it was seen by the KANU party of Uhuru Kenyatta, as a threat to national unity and the return of ethnic violence to the country. Controversy over the term Because of its original usage as a plan for ethnoregional devolution that was promoted by the European settlers as a post-independence fallback bid to retain some political power in a majority-Black African country, the later usage of the term as \\"devolution\\" has engendered controversy in the press. Indeed, the Bomas draft defines devolution as usambazaji wa madaraka (literally, \\"division of self-governance\\") and in the campaigns for the 2010 constitutional referendum, within which devolution again, featured as part of the draft constitution, the term Majimbo was ignored by the proponents of the draft, in favour of 'Ugatuzi.'

Early life and education Born in Paris to Donald Eugene Smith and Mary Elizabeth (Betty) Reichert, Smith grew up in Washington, D.C. with his six sisters and two brothers. For elementary school, he attended Blessed Sacrament School. For grades 7‚Äì12, he went to St. Anselm's Abbey School. Smith began his university studies at Johns Hopkins University receiving his B.A. in English in 1976. He received his Masters in theology at Catholic University of America in 1978. He received a Masters of Theological Studies, concentrating in biblical studies, at Harvard Divinity School, in 1981. At Harvard, Smith studied with Frank Moore Cross, Thomas Lambdin, William Moran, and Michael D. Coogan. Primarily studying West Semitic languages and literatures, including the Hebrew Bible, Smith took an M.A. (1982), M.Phil. (1983), and Ph.D. (1985) in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures at Yale University. His advisor and director of his dissertation on Kothar-wa-Khasis, the Ugaritic craftsman god, was Marvin H. Pope, author of works on Ugaritic and biblical religion, including two commentaries in the Anchor Bible series on the Song of Songs and Job. At Yale, Smith also studied with Franz Rosenthal, Brevard Childs, Robert R. Wilson, and W. W. Hallo. While writing his dissertation, he studied at the Hebrew University for a year (1984‚Äì1985) under Jonas C. Greenfield. Career After graduate school, Smith focused on the history of Israelite and ancient Near Eastern religion. He also began to explore the representation of deities and divinity in the Hebrew Bible and the ancient Near East from the Bronze Age to the Greco-Roman period. For several summers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he also studied Dead Sea Scrolls with John Strugnell at the Ecole Biblique. This work issued in the publications of four manuscripts of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Smith was the chair of Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies in the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University, and then came to be professor of Old Testament Language and Exegesis at Princeton Theological Seminary. Smith made many contributions to the study of the Hebrew Bible and Northwest Semitic texts as well as Ugaritic literature and religion.Oriental Institute Research Archives - A Bibliography of Ugaritic Grammar and Biblical Hebrew Grammar in the Twentieth CenturyJournal of Hebrew Scriptures - Volume 4 (2002-2003) - Review Mark S.

Rizzuto was born in Cattolica Eraclea, Sicily, Italy, in 1924, and immigrated to Montreal in 1954 with his wife, son and daughter. Rizzuto married into the mob through his wife Libertina Manno's family. He began as an associate in the Sicilian faction of the Calabrian Cotroni crime family which had most of the control in Montreal. In the late 1970s, a mob war broke out between the Sicilian and Calabrian factions, which resulted in the deaths of Paolo Violi, the acting captain of the Cotroni family, and his brothers. Although Rizzuto was not charged with any of these murders, he was linked to them as the events allowed the Rizzuto family to emerge as the preeminent crime family in Montreal by the early 1980s. Rizzuto was jailed twice, once in 1988 on drug charges where he served five years in a Venezuelan prison, and the other in 2006 where he served two years of a tax- evasion charge. His son Vito later followed him into the mob, and in 2007, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder as well as racketeering, and served a prison sentence until 2012. During this time, a power struggle within the Rizzuto family ensued; his grandson Nicolo Jr. was killed in 2009, followed by Rizzuto himself by a sniper rifle while in his home on November 10, 2010. Early life and family Rizzuto was born in Cattolica Eraclea, in the province of Agrigento, Sicily on February 18, 1924. In January 1925, his father Vito Rizzuto Sr. illegally immigrated to the United States with his brother-in-law Calogero Renda, while Vito's wife Maria Renda stayed with Nicolo in Sicily. On August 12, 1933, Vito was murdered in Patterson, New York, U.S., forcing Nicolo to grow up with a stepfather after his mother remarried to Liborio Milioto.Lamothe & Humphreys, The Sixth Family (2nd edition), p. 17Edwards & Nicaso, Business or Blood: Mafia Boss Vito Rizzuto's Last War, chronology Nicolo married into the mob by marrying Libertina Manno, on March 20, 1945, the daughter of Antonio Manno, a local Mafia leader in their hometown. On February 21, 1946, Nicolo would father a son, Vito, who would later follow him into the mob. On February 21, 1954, with his wife, son and daughter, Nicolo immigrated to Canada, arriving by ship, and docking at Pier 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia before moving on to Montreal, Quebec. He was able to form his own crew with help from several other Sicilian relatives and associates living there.Hit 'signals war', National Post, November 9, 2010 Antonio Manno would later immigrate to Montreal as well, on September 11, 1964. Rizzuto had ties to organized crime in Canada, the United States, Venezuela and Italy. He began his Mafia career in Canada as an associate of the Cotroni crime family that controlled much of Montreal's drug trade in the 1970s while answering to the Bonanno crime family of New York. He was, however, more closely linked to the Sicilian Mafia, in particular the Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan, who came from the same region in Sicily as Rizzuto. , by Tom Blickman, Transnational Organized Crime, Vol. 3, No. 2, Summer 1997 Rizzuto had two grandsons by his son Vito and his wife Giovanna Cammalleri: Leonardo Rizzuto and Nicolo \\"Nick\\" Rizzuto Jr, and a granddaughter: Maria Rizzuto. On December 28, 2009, Nick Rizzuto Jr. was shot and killed near his car in Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce, a borough in Montreal. \\"Mobster's son slain in street\\" , National Post, December 29, 2009 (accessed December 29, 2009)Nicol√≤ Rizzuto: Mafia boss who rose to become head of Canada‚Äôs largest crime syndicate , The Independent Obituary, 16 November 2010\\"Who was Nick Rizzuto Jr.?\\" , The Montreal Gazette, December 28, 2009 (accessed December 29, 2009) Paolo Renda, Nicolo's son-in-law, disappeared on May 20, 2010, and is presumed to have been kidnapped.Kiss of death for Montreal's Rizzuto clan? , The Montreal Gazette, May 22, 2010 On December 23, 2013, Vito died from complications of lung cancer at a Montreal hospital, after he had been released on October 5, 2012 after serving over five years in prison for murder and racketeering charges. Mob war In the 1970s, Rizzuto was an underling in the Sicilian faction, led by Luigi Greco until his death in 1972,Lamothe, Lee. Humphreys, Adrian. The Sixth Family: The Collapse of the New York Mafia and the Rise of Vito Rizzuto. pg.27‚Äì29 Manning, George A, PH.D Financial Investigation and Forensic Accounting pg.214‚Äì215 of the Calabrian Cotroni crime family. As tension then grew into a power struggle between the Calabrian and Sicilian factions of the family, a mob war began in 1973. Cotroni capodecina Paolo Violi complained about the independent modus operandi of his Sicilian 'underlings', Rizzuto in particular. \\"He is going from one side to the other, here and there, and he says nothing to nobody, he is doing business and nobody knows anything,\\" Violi said about Rizzuto. Violi asked for more 'soldiers' from his Bonanno bosses, clearly preparing for war, and Violi's boss at the time, Vic Cotroni remarked: \\"Me, I'm capodecina. I got the right to expel.\\" In 1977, Rizzuto and Violi met face-to-face in the home of a Montreal resident for a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences, according to a police report. But the peace talks failed, and most of the Rizzuto family fled to Venezuela. This led to a violent Mafia war in Montreal which resulted in the deaths of Violi and his brothers, along with others, spanning the mid-1970s to the early 1980s until the war ceased. Although Rizzuto was in Venezuela at the time, he was linked to the 1978 murder of Paolo Violi, a Bonanno soldier who had been named acting boss of the Cotroni family. Domenico Manno, Antonio Manno's son, was also instrumental in Violi's murder. Manno received a seven-year sentence after pleading guilty to conspiring to kill Violi, as well as Rizzuto confidant Agostino Cuntrera, who received a five-year sentence in relation to Violi's murder. By the mid 1980s, the Rizzuto crime family emerged as Montreal's pre-eminent crime family after the turf war.Lamothe & Humphreys, The Sixth Family, p.308 Legal problems Nicolo Rizzuto was arrested in Venezuela on August 2, 1988, after investigators found 700 grams of cocaine at Rizzuto's residence. Rizzuto was sentenced to eight years in a Venezuelan prison, but was paroled after five years, in 1993, after an associate of the family delivered an $800,000 bribe to Venezuelan officials. Rizzuto's lawyers said it was due to his health condition. On May 23, 1993, Rizzuto landed back in Montreal. On November 22, 2006, Rizzuto was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in a police raid, along with Paolo Renda, Rocco Sollecito, Francesco Arcadi, Lorenzo Giordano, Francesco Del Balso and dozens others, following a four-year investigation named Project Colis√©e.Mob takes a hit , The Montreal Gazette, November 23, 2006 On September 18, 2008, Rizzuto pleaded guilty to possession of proceeds of a crime for the benefit of, the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization. On October 16, 2008, Rizzuto was released from prison after serving two years of a suggested four-year sentence, as prosecutors could not directly implicate Rizzuto in crimes exposed by investigators. On February 11, 2010, Rizzuto entered a guilty plea for two counts of tax evasion charges, which stemmed from a Canada Revenue Agency investigation for the tax years of 1994 and 1995. Rizzuto was accused of hiding $5.2 million deposited in Swiss bank accounts and failing to report $728,000 in interest income. Rizzuto was ordered to pay a $209,000 fine.Rizzuto clan head pleads guilty to tax evasion , CBC News, February 11, 2010 Death On November 10, 2010, Rizzuto was killed at his residence in the Cartierville borough of Montreal when a single bullet from a sniper's rifle punched through double-paned glass of the rear patio doors of his mansion; he was 86. His death is believed to be the final blow against the Rizzuto crime family. Rizzuto's funeral was held at the Church of the Madonna della Difesa in Montreal's Little Italy on November 15, attended by around 800 people. He was buried at Saint-Fran√ßois d'Assise cemetery in Saint-Leonard, Quebec in a private ceremony. In popular culture Mafia expert Antonio Nicaso and Peter Edwards published a book about Nicolo's son Vito's final events, Business or Blood: Mafia Boss Vito Rizzuto's Last War (2015). It was later adapted into the television drama series Bad Blood, which debuted in fall 2017; Nicolo was portrayed by Paul Sorvino.

It honors those who died during the month of September 1814 during the War of 1812. The monument lies in the middle of the street and is between the two Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses that are located on the opposite sides of North Calvert Street. It was sponsored by the City and the \\"Committee of Vigilance and Safety\\" led by Mayor Edward Johnson and military commanders: Brig. Gen. John Stricker, Maj. Gen. Samuel Smith and Lt. Col. George Armistead (of Fort McHenry). The site of the former first Baltimore County and Town/City Courthouse (torn down in 1809) was originally designated as the location for the newly planned Washington Monument. Designed by Robert Mills (1781-1855), the cornerstone of the Washington Monument for Baltimore had just been laid on Independence Day, July 4, 1815. But fears that the designed shaft of the column would be too tall for the smaller open space of the old Courthouse Square, and might fall over onto nearby close-in townhouses, caused a last- minute change in location. The monument site for the nation's first president was moved further north of the city into \\"Howard's Woods\\" of the \\"Belvindere\\" estate of Col. John Eager Howard (1752-1827). 1846 Battle Monument The monument, designed by Baltimore architect J. Maximilian M. Godefroy (sculptor to the Court of Spain) and built in 1815-25, is 39 feet (11.9 m) tall. The base of the monument is an Egyptian Revival cenotaph. It is an unusually democratic monument for the time in that it records the names of all who died, regardless of rank.Dorsey, John & Dilts, James D., Guide to Baltimore Architecture (1997) p. 145-146. Tidewater Publishers, Centreville, Maryland The eighteen layers of the marble base represent the eighteen states that made up the United States at the time of the war. A griffin is at each corner of the base. The column, carved as a Roman fasces, is bound with cords listing the names of soldiers who died during the battle, while the names of officers who died are at the top. The monument is topped by an 8 feet tall 2,750 pound Carrara marble statue by Antonio Capellano of a female figure representing the City of Baltimore that wears a crown of victory and holds a laurel wreath in one hand and a ship's rudder in the other. It was hoisted to the top of the column during the middle of the period of construction on the eighth anniversary ceremonies, Defenders Day, September 12, 1822. Colloquially called Lady Baltimore, the statue was relocated to the Maryland Historical Society on October 5, 2013 in order to preserve it from further damage caused by time and nature. It was replaced by a concrete replica.Walker, Andrea K. \\"Lady Baltimore moves into its new home,\\" The Baltimore Sun, Saturday, October 5, 2013. The monument is the oldest stone monument and first public war memorial in the United States.http://www.stevetatti.com/featured-projects/ The monument is depicted on the seal of the City of Baltimore that was adopted in 1827 and the city's flag adopted in the early 20th century. The monument is erroneously depicted as being in Washington, D.C. in the 2007 film Live Free or Die Hard starring Bruce Willis, which had numerous scenes actually filmed in downtown Baltimore.

It takes place in ancient Rome, but the ideas and themes characterize the age of Louis XIV, most notably the establishment of royal power over the nobility. A production was laid on in Bayonne in 1660 just before the King arrived for his wedding to the Infanta. Corneille addresses the question of clemency and advocates an end to spiraling vengeance. His response is apologetic towards absolute power. As in many of his plays, the heroine is noted for her high tone.Louis Auchincloss, False Dawn p 4  Plot summary  Augustus granting clemency Act 1 - Emperor Augustus has executed Toranius, the father of young Emilie whom he considers nonetheless like a daughter. Emilie, in love with Cinna, asks him to save her honor by killing Augustus. In exchange, she will marry Cinna. With the help of his friend, Maxime, Cinna plots to kill the emperor. Act 2 - Augustus, tired of ruling the Roman Empire, seeks the advice of his friends Maxime and Cinna. Should he renounce his rule? Because he desires the love of Emilie, Cinna advises Augustus to keep his throne so he can go forward with his assassination plot. Augustus thanks the two men by offering them important government posts and land, and he even offers Emilie to Cinna as wife. Act 3 - Meanwhile, Maxime is also in love with Emilie, and when Cinna reveals his true reason for advising Augustus to stay on the throne, Maxime is overcome with jealousy. Maxime's servant, Euphorbe, suggests that Maxime betray Cinna and go to Caesar with the assassination plot so that he may receive Emilie in marriage; however, Maxime does not listen. Cinna is faced with a dilemma: the probity and generosity of Augustus has caused him to question his devotion to Emilie. He nonetheless decides to go through with the assassination attempt to please his lover. Act 4 - Euphorbe, claiming to be sent by Maxime, goes to Augustus to reveal everything. Caesar's wife, Livie, tells him to pardon Cinna in order to gain glory and respect, but Augustus is apparently deaf to these arguments and calls Cinna before him. Maxime goes to find Emilie to declare his love, but Emilie pushes him away and accuses him of betraying Cinna. Act 5 - Emilie finds Cinna before Augustus. She declares her guilt and tries to clear Cinna's name by saying that she seduced him to do her will. Cinna tries to protect Emilie by declaring her story to be false. Finally, Maxime enters and declares that he and Euphorbe had made the entire story up. Faced with those he holds dear, Augustus decides to pardon them all. He proposes that his enemies take the government positions and lands that he offered them prior to the scandal, and they all accept and thank him graciously.

He is especially well known for the many churches he built. Life From 1901 to 1906, Elsaesser studied architecture at the Technical University of Munich under Friedrich von Thiersch and the Technical University of Stuttgart under Theodor Fischer. In 1905 he won the competition for the Lutheran church of Baden-Baden and started to be active as a freelance architect. From 1911 to 1913 he served as an assistant to Professor Paul Bonatz, at Stuttgart Technical University. In 1913, he became professor for medieval architecture at the same institution (until 1920). From 1920 to 1925 he was managing director of the School of Arts and Crafts at Cologne (later known as the K√∂lner Werkschulen). In 1925, Ernst May, then government building surveyor in Frankfurt am Main, made him chief of the city's municipal building department whis was responsible for the New Frankfurt project. Elsaesser kept that post until 1932. His largest construction during his time at Frankfurt was the Grossmarkthalle. During the reign of National Socialism, Elsaesser did not receive any commissions. Nonetheless, he did not opt for emigration; instead he spent the war years in internal exile, pursuing architectural study tours and utopian designs. After the war, he was professor of design at Munich Technical University from 1947 to 1956. Many of his churches contain paintings by the artist K√§te Schaller-H√§rlin. His grandson is the international film historian Thomas Elsaesser.

It closed on 4 June 2004 and is considered a major example of expressionist architecture.  History  Inside, 2002 The massive structure on the right bank of the Main, immediately adjacent to Frankfurt's east port (Osthafen), was designed by Martin Elsaesser as part of the New Frankfurt- project. It was inaugurated on 25 October 1928. With a length of 220 m, a width of 50 m and a height of 17 to 23 m (722 by 164 by 55 to 75 ft), it was the city's largest architectural unit at the time. It provided 13,000 square metres (140,000 ft2) of space for a total of 130 stalls, most of which served large-scale customers, such as hospitality businesses or retailers. The building, and its surroundings, also hosted offices and storage space for wholesalers, shipping companies and agencies. From October 1941 onwards, the National Socialists used the Gro√ümarkthalle as a collecting point for the deportation of Jewish men, women and children from Frankfurt and its region. Since 1997, this locally important role within the holocaust is recognised by a commemorative plaque.Gedenktafel an der Gro√ümarkthalle , documented by the Institut f√ºr Stadtgeschichte (Institute for the city's history), Karmeliterkloster, Frankfurt am Main The Gro√ümarkthalle, locally known as \\"Gemieskersch\\" (Frankfurt Hessian for \\"Gem√ºsekirche\\", literally \\"vegetable church\\"), has been a listed building since 1984. In 2004, its function was transferred to the \\"Frischezentrum Frankfurt\\" in the suburban district of Kalbach-Riedberg, with a total of 128,000 square metres (1,380,000 ft2) of space, including 23,000 square metres (250,000 ft2) for retail purposes. Gro√ümarkthalle (right) and Deutschherrnbr√ºcke (left)  New use by the European Central Bank  View from north On 1 January 2005, the City of Frankfurt transferred the Gro√ümarkthalle and its area to the European Central Bank (the sale contract had been signed in 2002), which will erect its seat there. The main part of the hall will be preserved. It will mainly house the public functions of the ECB, such as a visitors' area, the staff restaurant, as well as press and conference spaces. The space between the hall and the Main river will be taken up by the Skytower, a complex of two intertwined 180 m (590 ft) skyscrapers, designed by the Vienna-based Coop Himmelb(l)au. It is projected for completion in 2011. A memorial for the deported Jews will also be created, in close cooperation with the Jewish Museum Frankfurt. In November 2006, the planning committee of Frankfurt accepted a proposal to de-list the so-called annexbauten, two transversal buildings added to the narrow ends of the hall, originally serving clerical and social functions. The local heritage authorities have permitted the demolition of these structures. Furthermore, the western third of the hall's roof, destroyed in World War II and restored thereafter will be cut by a diagonal structure placed partially inside and partially outside the hall so as to \\"let the building's new function spread beyond its confines\\".Frankfurter Rundschau from 7 November 2006 According to the heirs of the building's architect, Martin Elsaesser (died in 1957), the external appearance of the Gro√ümarkthalle may not be changed according to moral rights, so that the planned alterations would require their agreement until such rights expire 70 years after the death of Elsaesser.Frankfurter Rundschau, 24 November 2006For relevant court cases, see This view may be inaccurate, since it is now known that there is 1932 contract between Elsaesser and the city of Frankfurt that permits alterations to the structure of the hall.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 13 December 2006  Description of the hall  View from Main Tower of the west side of the Gro√ümarkthalle The Gro√ümarkthalle Frankfurt am Main is a massively built hall with a roof freely spanning 50 m (164 ft). At the time of its construction it was the world's widest monocoque construction. The entirety of the area is roofed by 15 barrel vaults with a support span of 36.9 m (121 ft) and a vault span of 14.1 m (46 ft). The concrete \\"barrels\\" (Zeiss-Dywidag barrels) are made of concrete and are only 7 cm (23/4 in) thick. Their basic form is a half ellipse of 6 m (20 ft) height. It was realised between 1926 and 1928 by Franz Dischinger and Ulrich Finsterwalder. The hall itself was built in only 24 weeks by the companies Dyckerhoff & Widmann (Dywidag) and Wayss & Freytag AG.

Discovered in 1970 during the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, it yielded a radiocarbon date of 10,540 B.P., making it the oldest site of human activity then known in the state. Description The Gallagher Flint Station site is located in the foothills on the north side of the Brooks Range in far northern Alaska, near the Sagavanirktok River. There are three separate areas of archaeological interest within the site, two of which overlap slightly in their vertical stratigraphy. The isolated site, Locality 2, consists of two hearths with stone tools, including bifacial blades, and evidence of tool work. This site yielded a radiocarbon date of about 1,000 BCE. The other two areas, Localities 1 and 1A, partially overlap. Locality 1A yielded a radiocarbon date of about 650 BCE, and tool finds there included fragments of a drill bit made of green chert. Locality 1 exhibits the characteristics of a tool workshop, and yielded a date of 10,540 before present, or about 8,500 BCE; the oldest previous dates recovered in the state were for c. 8,000 BCE. Older dates have since been obtained at the Dry Creek Archeological Site. The most notable feature of the stone tools found at Locality 1 is the absence of bifacial tools. None of the three localities included any remains of animal-based tools (made with antler, bone, or other animal parts). The site has been interpreted as a quarry site, where the users worked on tools while observing the countryside for prey to hunt. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The most common cause of CVI is superficial venous reflux which is a treatable condition. As functional venous valves are required to provide for efficient blood return from the lower extremities, this condition typically affects the legs. If the impaired vein function causes significant symptoms, such as swelling and ulcer formation, it is referred to as chronic venous disease. It is sometimes called chronic peripheral venous insufficiency and should not be confused with post- thrombotic syndrome in which the deep veins have been damaged by previous deep vein thrombosis. Most cases of CVI can be improved with treatments to the superficial venous system or stenting the deep system. Varicose veins for example can now be treated by local anesthetic endovenous surgery. Rates of CVI are higher in women than in men. Other risk factors include genetics, smoking, obesity, pregnancy, and prolonged standing. Signs and symptoms Chronic venous insufficiency Signs and symptoms of CVI in the leg include the following: * Varicose veins * Itching (pruritus) * Hyperpigmentation * Phlebetic lymphedema * Chronic swelling of the legs and ankles * Venous ulceration CVI in the leg may cause the following: * Venous stasis * Ulcers. * Stasis dermatitis, also known as varicose eczema * Contact dermatitis, a disrupted epidermal barrier due to venous insufficiency, making patients more susceptible than the general population to contact sensitization and subsequent dermatitis. * Atrophie blanche, an end point of a variety of conditions that appears as atrophic plaques of ivory white skin with telangiectasias. It represents late sequelae of lipodermatosclerosis where the skin has lost its nutrient blood flow. * Lipodermatosclerosis, an indurated plaque in the medial malleolus. * Malignancy, malignant degeneration being a rare but important complication of venous disease since tumors which develop in the setting of an ulcer tend to be more aggressive. * Pain, a feature of venous disease often overlooked and commonly undertreated. * Anxiety * Depression * Inflammation * Cellulitis Causes Venous valves The most common cause of chronic venous insufficiency is reflux of the venous valves of superficial veins. This may in turn be caused by several conditions: * Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), that is, blood clots in the deep veins. Chronic venous insufficiency caused by DVT may be described as postthrombotic syndrome. DVT which triggers an inflammatory response subsequently injuring the vein wall. * Superficial vein thrombosis. * Phlebitis * May‚ÄìThurner syndrome. This is a rare condition in which blood clots occur in the iliofemoral vein due to compression of the blood vessels in the leg. The specific problem is compression of the left common iliac vein by the overlying right common iliac artery. Many May-Thurner compressions are overlooked when there is no blood clot. More and more of them get nowadays diagnosed and treated (by stenting) due to advanced imaging techniques. Deep and superficial vein thrombosis may in turn be caused by thrombophilia, which is an increased propensity of forming blood clots. Arteriovenous fistula (an abnormal connection or passageway between an artery and a vein) may cause chronic venous insufficiency even with working vein valves. Diagnosis B-flow ultrasonograph over a valve of the great saphenous vein, showing a venous reflux (flow toward right in the image). History and examination by a clinician for characteristic signs and symptoms are sufficient in many cases in ruling out systemic causes of venous hypertension such as hypervolemia and heart failure. Topic last updated: Dec 04, 2017. A duplex ultrasound (doppler ultrasonography and b-mode) can detect venous obstruction or valvular incompetence as the cause, and is used for planning venous ablation procedures, but it is not necessary in suspected venous insufficiency where surgical intervention is not indicated. Insufficiency within a venous segment is defined as reflux of more than 0.5 seconds with distal compression. Invasive venography can be used in patients who may require surgery or have suspicion for venous stenosis. Other modalities that may be employed are: ankle-brachial index to exclude arterial pathology, air or photoplethysmography, intravascular ultrasound, and ambulatory venous pressures, which provides a global assessment of venous competence. Venous plethysmography can assess for reflux and muscle pump dysfunction but the test is laborious and rarely done. The venous filling time after the patient is asked to stand up from a seated position also is used to assess for CVI. Rapid filling of the legs less than 20 seconds is abnormal. =Classification= Acute ulcer (45 x 30 mm). CEAP classification is based on clinical, causal, anatomical, and pathophysiological factors. According to Widmer classification diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency is clearly differentiated from varicose veins. It has been developed to guide decision-making in chronic venous insufficiency evaluation and treatment. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The CEAP classification for CVI is as follows: C0: no obvious feature of venous disease C1: the presence of reticular or spider veins C2: Obvious varicose veins C: Presence of edema but no skin changes C4: skin discoloration, pigmentation C5: Ulcer that has healed C6: Acute ulcer Etiology Primary Secondary (trauma, birth control pill) Congenital (Klipper trenaunay) No cause is known Anatomic Superficial Deep Perforator No obvious anatomic location Pathophysiology Obstruction, thrombosis Reflux Obstruction and reflux No venous pathology Management =Conservative= Conservative treatment of CVI in the leg involves symptomatic treatment and efforts to prevent the condition from getting worse instead of effecting a cure. This may include * Manual compression lymphatic massage therapy * Red vine leaf extract may have a therapeutic benefit. * Sequential compression pump * Ankle pump * Compression stockings * Blood pressure medicine * Hydroxyethylrutoside medication * Frequent periods of rest elevating the legs above the heart level * Tilting the bed so that the feet are above the heart. This may be achieved by using a 20 cm (7-inch) bed wedge or sleeping in a 6 degree Trendelenburg position. Obese or pregnant people might be advised by their physicians to forgo the tilted bed. =Surgical= Surgical treatment of CVI attempts a cure by physically changing the veins with incompetent valves. Surgical treatments for CVI include the following: * Linton procedures (i.e. subfascial ligation of perforating veins in the lower extremity, an older treatment) * Ligation. Tying off a vein to prevent blood flow * Vein stripping. Removal of the vein. * Surgical repair. * Endovenous Laser Ablation * Vein transplant. * Subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery. Tying off the vein with an endoscope. * Valve repair (experimental) * Valve transposition (experimental) * Hemodynamic surgeries. Venous insufficiency conservative, hemodynamic and ambulatory treatment (CHIVA method) is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic. Prognosis CVI is not a benign disorder and, with its progression, can lead to morbidity. Venous ulcers are common and very difficult to treat. Chronic venous ulcers are painful and debilitating. Even with treatment, recurrences are common if venous hypertension persists. Nearly 60% develop phlebitis which often progresses to deep vein thrombosis in more than 50% of patients. The venous insufficiency can also lead to severe hemorrhage. Surgery for CVI remains unsatisfactory despite the availability of numerous procedures.

It is notable for being the earliest known adult film to incorporate bisexual and homosexual intercourse. Background Bernard Natan was a Romanian Jew who is claimed to have produced, directed and acted in at least one hardcore heterosexual pornographic film prior to 1920. In that year, at the end of World War I, Natan emigrated to France. Between 1920 and 1927, a group of at least 20 porn films appeared, sometimes attributed to Natan due to their internal coherence (a prolific number of films, considering the period and technology). Several of these films included homosexual and bisexual oral and anal intercourse, and Natan himself engaged in homosexual and bisexual sex on film. Le M√©nage moderne du Madame Butterfly is one the earliest pornographic films attributed to Natan, and the first of these works to depict homosexuality and bisexuality. Although the release date is uncertain, scholars believe the film was distributed as early as 1920. The production values on the film are notably high, even for a mainstream feature film of the day. It includes location shots of an Asian street full of rickshaws and a sailing ship on the Pacific Ocean. The costumes and sets are almost lavish. The film has a lengthy and complex plot, and includes intertitles. Synopsis The film is based on the opera Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini. Lt. Pinkerton is a strapping American sailor in Japan. He marries Madame Butterfly and ravishes her while Butterfly's maid, Soosooky (or Soussaki) watches and masturbates. Pinkerton leaves. A new character, Pink-hop \\"the coolie boy\\" (played by Natan), spies on Butterfly and Soosooky as they engage in lesbian sex. He masturbates while watching them. Pinkerton returns, and is angered by Pink-hop's delay in opening the door. As punishment, he engages in oral and anal homosexual intercourse with the male servant. The violent intent of the punishment is mixed with humor (such as Pinkerton wiggling his buttocks at the camera). Pinkerton then engages in oral, anal, and vaginal sex with Soosooky. A new male character, Mr. Sharpless, meets with Butterfly and performs various sex acts with her before telling her that Pinkerton is a bigamist. Pinkerton, Soosooky, and Pink-hop return. Butterfly is angry, but soon succumbs to her lust for Pinkerton. All five individuals have sexual intercourse. Pink-hop engages in receptive anal intercourse with Pinkerton and Sharpless while performing cunnilingus on the women. While having vaginal and anal sex with the women, Pink-hop also fellates Pinkerton and Sharpless. The film ends with Pinkerton waving at the audience. There are two extant sets of intertitles, in French and English. The French intertitles are generally witty and humorous, poking fun at racism and American arrogance while making a number of double entendres. The English intertitles are far more crude and racist in tone. Notability Le M√©nage moderne du Madame Butterfly is the oldest known motion picture to depict hardcore homosexual sex acts on film. The first known motion pictures depicting nude men were made by Eadweard Muybridge in the 1880s and 1890s as part of his studies of human locomotion. The first known pornographic film of any kind appears to have been made in 1908. Between 1908 and the advent of public theatrical screenings in the United States in 1970, about 2,000 hardcore pornographic films were made (with roughly 500 of these made prior to 1960). The best estimate is that about 10 percent of all hardcore \\"stag films\\" made prior to 1970 contain some sort of homosexual activity. This ranges from an innocuous hand on a shoulder, thigh or hip to hardcore anal and oral sex (and much more). Nevertheless, nearly all the extant works depict homosexual sex in the context of a heterosexual hegemony. Most depict homosexual sex occurring during heterosexual intercourse (essentially making the sex act bisexual in nature). Le M√©nage moderne du Madame Butterfly is unusual in that it not only depicts homosexual sex acts, but that it does so very early in the history of pornographic film. However, like most of the films which came after it, Le M√©nage moderne du Madame Butterfly only shows male-male sex acts as deviant, firmly establishes the heterosexuality of the characters, and often depicts the sex acts as essentially bisexual (e.g., male-male sexual contact occurs while the men are also having heterosexual intercourse). The film is also thought notable for being one of the first adult films to be produced or directed by Bernard Natan. Scholars have expressed surprise that a beginning filmmaker would produce a work which contained sex acts which might anger or offend the target audience (straight men). That Bernard would do so is a testament, film historians have said, to his willingness to take risks and his subtle understanding of the role homoeroticism and homosexuality play in French male sexual identity. Natan's alleged willingness to not only produce, write, and direct but also star in a hardcore bisexual film is even more startling when one recognizes that, within nine years of the release of Le M√©nage moderne du Madame Butterfly, Bernard Natan would be the owner of the largest mainstream film studio in France‚ÄîPath√©.

Also, Rathbone, Dr. Brain's laboratory rat, provides what limited verbal humor can be found in the game. Gameplay The Main Navigation Area As in the first two games, Lost Mind features science related puzzles. While the previous installments featured a large, semi-free- roaming environment, however, Lost Mind confines the player to a single area (Dr. Brain's laboratory), with puzzles accessed from a central 'map' screen. Similarly, while the previous games' puzzles ranged across a variety of disciplines (both Castle and Island contained memory and word puzzles, as well as puzzles related to art and the sciences), Lost Mind focuses solely on the human brain, with puzzles related to spatial orientation, memorization, and symbolic association. Dreamland Due to the limited game environment, much of the humor that was found in the first two games is missing in Lost Mind; since the player no longer has free rein over an entire island or castle, there is very little to explore, and very little to interact with.

Originally launched in England, the company moved later to California. In addition to producing boxed wargames, 3W published the magazine The Wargamer. TSR published the magazine Strategy & Tactics from 1983 ‚Äì 1987 and then sold the rights to 3W, who published the magazine from #112 (June, 1987) to #139; after 3W's Keith Poulter got out of the business, Strategy & Tactics was sold to Decision Games. Diverse Talents, Inc., the publishers of Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer, Fire and Movement, and Battleplan magazines, was bought by World Wide Wargames, Inc. on June 1, 1988. Hobbyist magazine publisher Diverse Talents Inc. (DTI) published a third iteration of Space Gamer, and after that ownership of DTI passed on to 3W who started publication with Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer #83 (1988) as part of a general push by 3W into the RPG industry. Besides Space Gamer they published several licensed adventures, such as City of Angels (1989) for Twilight: 2000, The Liftwood Conspiracy (1989) for Space: 1889 and Operation Overlord (1989) for Traveller: 2300. According to Shannon Appelcline, \\"Under the 3W ownership, the quality of the Space Gamer magazines improved but they still looked somewhat dated. 3W decided to resolve this problem following the release of Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer #85 (January/February, 1989). Afterward they 'rebooted' the magazine. Space Gamer Vol. II, No. 1 (July/August, 1989) featured a much more professional cover and somewhat improved interior contents. Unfortunately the new Space Gamer only lasted through Vol. II, No. 2 (October/November, 1989). In that last issue, the editor rather angrily decried White Wolf Magazine who had said that they were 'the only independent magazine left in the market'. But, for all purposes that statement was largely true. Though considerably improved from its worst DTI days, the times of Space Gamer influencing the industry were over.\\" 3W got out of the RPG business in late 1989, as part of a general sell-off resulting from some failed expansions in the late 1980s. Thereafter ownership of Space Gamer moved on to Future Combat Simulations, who put out a single issue, Space Gamer #88 (March/April, 1990). After that, the company also took charges of the magazine Moves for several years before selling to Decision Games. The company was known to be extremely prolific and to produce simple games, with a lot of scenarios available in each game, and always at a reasonable price. They also published the magazine Schwerpunkt. The company closed in 1995.

The word comes from the Greek ŒµœÉœÄŒµœÅŒπŒΩœåœÇ and its Latin equivalent vesper, meaning \\"evening.\\" In Lutheranism the traditional form has varied widely with time and place. Martin Luther, in his German Mass and Order of Divine Service (1526') recommended reading the gospel in Latin in schools: \\"Then let another boy read the same chapter in German for practice, and in case any layman were there to hear...In the same way at Vespers, let them sing the Vesper Psalms as sung hitherto, in Latin, with an antiphon; then a hymn, as there is opportunity.\\" While Latin vespers continued to be said in large churches, many experiments with simplified liturgies were made, including combining the hours of vespers and compline, as in Thomas Cranmer's Anglican evensong. Under the influence of the 20th century Liturgical movement the Alpirsbach circle reintroduced Gregorian chant and spawned the Evangelisch-Lutherische Gebetsbruderschaft, established in 1954, which publishes the Breviarium Lipsiensae or Leipzig Breviary.

It had remained unused since the end of Cavalli's opera. It is likely that Louis XIV also wished to re-use some or all of the sets from Ercole Amante, at the very least the sets representing Hell. Moli√®re did not have time to versify the entire play. He was responsible for inventing and outlining the plot, including the coordination of the interm√®des which involved singers, dancers and machines. He versified the prologue, the first act and the first scene of acts two and three. The rest of the play was versified by Pierre Corneille. Philippe Quinault wrote all of the poetry that was set to music. The music itself was composed by Jean-Baptiste Lully. =Sources= The subject is taken from Apuleius's Metamorphoses (also known as The Golden Ass). The story of Psyche and Cupid is recounted by an old woman to a young girl kidnapped by brigands. Apuleius's version was far too ribald and overtly sexual for the 17th century stage, or even for the 17th century reader, and the story had been adapted to the morals of the time on several occasions. There were two ballets on the subject: the Ballet de la reine tir√© de la fable de Psych√© of 1619 and Benserade's Ballet de Psych√© of 1656. La Fontaine had also published a conte entitled Les Amours de Psych√© et de Cupidon in 1669. Plot summary Prologue: Flora and her followers summon Venus to participate in their games (in celebration of the peace that Louis XIV has brought to the world). Venus arrives in a fury, however, and breaks the hitherto musical atmosphere of the prologue. She sends her son to punish Psyche, despite his reticence. Act one: Psyche's jealous sisters attempt to attract the attention of her two most recent suitors, without success. Psyche refuses both suitors before being called away by a messenger. The messenger then informs Psyche's sisters that she must be sacrificed on the mountain top and devoured by a monster. The sisters confess their delight before a group of mourners arrive on stage and sing the first interm√®de, the plainte italienne. Act two: The King informs Psyche of her fate. She accepts it unflinchingly, though her father prefers to defy the gods. After bidding him farewell, her sisters arrive and seem unwilling to leave her alone. Psyche pushes them to save themselves, but they reply that oracles are always mysterious and perhaps her fate will not be so hard after all. They finally leave and Psyche believes herself to be alone at last to face her doom when her suitors appear to defend her. She chastises their impiety. Their attempt to defend her is in any case vain, as she is carried away by zephyrs. The set changes for the third act, representing a magnificent palace. At this time, Vulcan sings the second intermede, encouraging his crew of cyclops to finish building the palace. Act three: Zephyr informs Cupid that he has successfully brought Psyche to her new palace and expresses his surprise at Cupid's new, adult appearance. Psyche wakes up and is confused by her splendid surroundings. Rather than being attacked by a monster, Psyche is greeted by the dashing figure of Cupid who declares his love for her. After a love scene, Psyche impresses upon Cupid (whose identity she still does not know) that she must share her happy fate with her sisters and father. Cupid resists, but finally concedes and sends Zephyr to fetch Psyche's sisters. For the third interm√®de, Cupid invites a Cupid and a Zephyr to sing a divertissement in honour of Love. Act four: Psyche's sisters, having seen Psyche's new home are, naturally, green with envy and try to find a way to spoil her happiness. They feed her curiosity regarding the identity of her lover and make her fear his unfaithfulness, suggesting that all the palace may be no more than a lie, an enchantment. Zephyr takes them away. Psyche demands to know the identity of her lover. Cupid resists, saying that to know his identity is to lose him forever, but swears that he will tell her if she wishes it absolutely. She insists, and Cupid confesses his identity, then disappears, taking the palace with him. Alone in a lugubrious setting, Psyche bemoans her fate, and resolves to drown herself in the river. The River God forbids her, saying the heavens forbid it and that an easier fate may be in store. But in the meantime, Venus arrives to chastise and to punish Psyche. In the fourth interm√®de Psyche descends to hell, where eight furies dance a ballet to celebrate the rage they have inspired in so sweet a goddess as Venus. Psyche passes in Charon's boat with the box the Venus orders her to obtain from Proserpine. Act five: Psyche is in Hell and meets her two suitors. They recount how they threw themselves from the rock on which Psyche was sacrificed, having been unable to prevent her death. They also recount the death of her sisters, who voluntarily threw themselves off a cliff, proudly believing that Zephyr would carry them back to Cupid's palace. Psyche, determined to regain the love of Cupid, opens Proserpine's box, hoping to enhance her beauty. But a poisonous vapour comes out of the box, killing her. Cupid descends to lament what her death and forgives her. Venus descends and chastises Cupid for his rebellion. He confronts his mother for her cruelty towards the object of his love. He calls on Jupiter for aid, who takes his side and grants Psyche immortality. The scene changes from Hell to Heaven and a great ballet is danced by the followers of Apollo, Bacchus, Momus and Mars to celebrate the union of Cupid and Psyche. Literary reception The play was given for the first time on January 17, 1671. Like the traditional ballet de cour of the time, many eminent figures at court participated in the ballets (particularly the final interm√®de) alongside professional musicians and dancers. The play and ballet were performed several times at the Salle des Tuileries during the Carnaval period. Moli√®re continued to give the play at his usual venue, the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal. He was required to renovate his theatre in order to stage the play. These renovations, consisting mostly in stage machinery, cost the troupe over 4000 livres (roughly 50 000 euros today), not including the cost of hiring extra musicians, singers and dancers. The investment proved worthwhile, however, since the success of the play was spectacular. During Moli√®re's lifetime (that is to say over the course of the next two years), the play was given 82 times (not including the initial representations at the Tuileries) for a total profit of 77 119 livres. It was necessary to modify the interm√®des somewhat since there was neither enough space nor enough money to mount such lavish ballets as at the Tuileries. But aside from the more restrained forces, the text and structure of the court and city versions are virtually identical. The same expense that pushed Moli√®re to reduce his cast has caused the play to become virtually unknown in our time. The play is too difficult to mount and is therefore known more as a work of literature to be studied than as a play that anyone has seen. But despite its impractical qualities (for today's theatre companies at least) and the limited participation of its principal author, Psych√© is widely accepted to be one of Moli√®re's greatest successes and one of his finest plays.

It is not known when Lu Yuanfang was born, but it is known that his family was from Su Prefecture (ËòáÂ∑û, roughly modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) and that he was from a line that had long served as officials during the Southern Dynasties. His grandfather or great-grandfather Lu Chen (Èô∏Áêõ)Lu's biography in both the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang indicated that Lu Chen was Lu Yuanfang's great-grandfather, but the table of chancellors' family trees in New Book of Tang indicated that Lu Chen was Lu Yuanfang's grandfather. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 92 and New Book of Tang, vol. 129 with New Book of Tang, vol. 73, part 2. served as an important official during Chen Dynasty. His uncle Lu Jianzhi (Èô∏Êü¨‰πã) was a well-known calligrapher and served as a Tang official, but his father Lu Xuanzhi (Èô∏ÁéÑ‰πã) was only a county sheriff. It was said that Lu Yuanfang initially passed one imperial examination out of eight‚Äîwhich was already enough for him to become an official‚Äîbut he later passed all eight. He eventually became an assistant censor. On one occasion during Wu Zetian's reign, he was commissioned to go investigate cases in the Lingnan region, which at that time required travel by sea. Once the ship launched, there was violent sea movement, and the people in the ship were fearful. Lu stated, \\"I am setting out on a mission, not for my own profit; how will the gods hurt me?\\" He ordered the ship to continue, and soon, the storm passed. After he returned, he was promoted as a censor and then successively as Fengge Sheren (È≥≥Èñ£Ëàç‰∫∫) -- a mid-level at the legislative bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge) -- and deputy minister of justice (ÁßãÂÆò‰æçÈÉé, Qiuguan Shilang). While serving as deputy minister of justice, he was falsely accused by the secret police official Lai Junchen, but contrary to the fate of most officials accused by Lai, Wu Zetian took no actions against him, and in 693 made him Luantai Shilang (È∏ûËá∫‰æçÈÉé) -- the deputy head of the examination bureau (È∏ûËá∫, Luantai) -- and gave him the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫Âπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. In late 694, Wu Zetian, displeased with the powerful chancellor Li Zhaode, exiled Li, and fellow chancellor Zhou Yunyuan and the assistant chief judge of the supreme court, Huangfu Wenbei (ÁöáÁî´ÊñáÂÇô), then submitted articles of impeachment against Lu and several fellow chancellors -- Doulu Qinwang, Wei Juyuan, Du Jingjian, and Su Weidao‚Äîfor not being able to curb Li Zhaode's power. The five chancellors so accused were all demoted to be prefectural prefect‚Äîin Lu's case, to be the prefect of Sui Prefecture (Á∂èÂ∑û, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi). Later, Lu was recalled to be the deputy minister of civil service affairs (Â§©ÂÆò‰æçÈÉé, Tianguan Shilang) and the minister of military supplies (Âè∏Ë°õÂçø, Siwei Qing). On one occasion, he was accused of only selecting his friends to be officials, and Wu Zetian, in anger, formally removed him from his posts but let him continue to serve in acting capacity. Lu continued to recommend officials, and when Wu Zetian asked how he dared to do so, he responded, \\"Your subject only knows how to recommend people that he knows about; I do not care whether they are friend or foe.\\" He further recommended his friend Cui Xuanwei, arguing that Cui had talent to be a chancellor. Wu Zetian by now was convinced that he was not personally biased. In 699, she again made him Luantai Shilang and chancellor with the Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi designation. However, in 700, there was an occasion on which Wu Zetian was asking Lu about what was happening outside the palace, and Lu responded, \\"Your subject is a chancellor, and I will surely report all that is important. The trivial things that happens within the populace is not something I dare to report to Your Imperial Majesty.\\" Wu Zetian was displeased, and she removed him as a chancellor, making him a staff member of her son and crown prince Li Xian (the later Emperor Zhongzong). Later, he was made Wengchang Zuo Cheng (ÊñáÊòåÂ∑¶‰∏û), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (ÊñáÊòåËá∫, Wenchang Tai), before he died of illness. It was said that Lu was honest and careful, and that in his second term as chancellor, whenever Wu Zetian was to commission an official, she would consult him first, but that he would never reveal the content of his recommendation. Before he died, he ordered that the drafts of all submissions that he made to Wu Zetian be brought to him and burned, stating, \\"My contributions to people are to remain hidden. Surely this will bring blessings to my descendants.\\" He had a locked chest that he had never allowed people to open, and after his death, his family members opened it up, finding only a collection of imperial edicts inside. His sons Lu Xiangxian, Lu Jingqian (Èô∏ÊôØÂÄ©), and Lu Jingrong (Èô∏ÊôØËûç) all became key officials later, and Lu Xiangxian served as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Ruizong and Emperor Xuanzong.

It consisted of two expeditions. The first was the only land campaign Said bin Sultan conducted in Arabia during his long reign.Calvin H. Allen, Jr, Oman: the Modernization of the Sultanate (Routledge, 1987), p. 47. It included a small allied British force and was defeated. The second, led by a more substantial British component, resulted in the destruction of the Bani Bu Ali. Company units engaged in the expedition received the \\"Beni Boo Alli\\" battle honour. Background The Bani Bu Ali tribe occupied the fortified village of Belad Bani Bu Ali (Place of the Sons of Ali) in Oman, in the hinterland of the Sultanate of Muscat, whose suzerainty the tribe nominally recognized. They did not, however, respect the good relations of sultan with the Company and engaged in piracy in the Arabian Sea.A. W. H. Lees, \\"A Forgotten Battle: Belad Beni Bu Ali, 1821\\", Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol. 14, No. 55 (1935), pp. 166‚Äì169. In 1819, the Company carried out a punitive expedition to Ras al Khaimah, which destroyed a pirate base and removed the threat of piracy from the Persian Gulf. As a result, several Gulf states signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 outlawing piracy. When the Bani Bu Ali murdered the pilot of a British ship carrying a British envoy at Rass al Junaiz, it was decided to dispatch of a small punitive expedition from India to Ash Sharqiyah (Oman) to assist the sultan in subduing the Bani Bu Ali.E. W. C. Sandes, The Indian Sappers and Miners (1948), pp. 126ff. First expedition (1820) The expedition sailed from Bombay in October 1820 and sailed to Sur via Muscat. The small force consisting of six companies (380 men) of Indian infantry, along with four six-pounder guns, under Captain Perronet Thomson joined the sultan's force of about 2000 irregulars. They proceeded inland to Belad Bani Bu Ali, the tribal capital. When negotiations failed,J. E. Peterson, Oman's Insurgencies: The Sultanate's Struggle for Supremacy (Saqi, 2013). on 18 November 1820, this force was attacked and almost annihilated as they approached the capital. The Arabs had charged with spears and swords. A majority of the British officers (seven) and two-thirds of the soldiers (270) were killed as the Arabs gave no quarter. The guns were all captured. The survivors, including many of the wounded, returned to Sur, thence to Muscat from where they were taken to Qishm at the entrance of the Persian Gulf. Second expedition (1821) The destruction of this force was a major blow to British prestige in Arabia and a second stronger expedition was assembled. This force of 6000 mixed British soldiers and Indian sepoys, under Major General Lionel Smith, sailed from Bombay on 11 January 1821. This force contained engineer elements of the Bombay Presidency army consisting of the newly formed company of the Bombay Sappers and Miners who, under Capt. T. Dickinson (Bombay Engineers) and assisted by Lt T.B. Jervis (Bombay Engineers), were proceeding abroad for the first time in their history. Along with the Sappers and Miners company sailed the 3rd Company of the Bombay Pioneers who had recently served in the 1819 Ras al-Khaimah expedition to suppress piracy in the Persian Gulf. The force disembarked at Sur on 27 January and marched into the interior. Repulsing an attack on 10 February, they reached Balad Bani Nu Hassan on 2 March. The Bani bu Ali advanced with desperate fanaticism to give battle in the open, ignoring the cannonades of grape-shot from the British guns. The Arabs fought bravely with broad-sword and shield, attempting to break the British line, causing havoc at close quarters wherever they could do so. However, the line of bayonets prevailed and the Bani bu Ali were beaten off, leaving behind 500 dead and dying. On the other hand, the British casualties were 29 dead and 173 wounded. The fort at Balad was occupied after a brief bombardment. Later, the expedition returned to Sur where they embarked for Bombay. The Bani bu Ali were vanquished, the fort at their capital occupied and British prestige restored. Battle honour By a General Order of the Bombay Presidency, dated 11 February 1831, all units which had served in the expedition were awarded the battle honour Beni Boo Ali, including the Bombay Pioneers and the Bombay Sappers and Miners. Beni Boo Ali heads the list of battle and theatre honours of the Bombay Sappers today. This honour is not considered repugnant.

He was officially credited with destroying enemy aircraft. Born in Wellington, Carbury joined the RAF in 1937 after being rejected by the Royal Navy. After completion of his flight training, he was posted to No. 41 Squadron where he learnt to fly Supermarine Spitfires. He was later sent to No. 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron to train its pilots how to handle the Spitfire. During the early stages of the Second World War, the squadron was based in Scotland and patrolled the North Sea during which time Carbury was credited with damaging at least three bombers. The squadron shifted south in August 1940 to join in the Battle of Britain. He shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter on 28 August and another the following day. On 31 August he destroyed five enemy aircraft, one of two RAF pilots to achieve this feat during the Battle of Britain. He saw continued action for the next two months, shooting down several more enemy aircraft. After the Battle of Britain, Carbury's squadron moved north and began operating from Scotland. At the end of the year, he was posted to No. 58 Operational Training Unit on instructing duties. In October 1941 he was courtmartialed for dishonesty offences and discharged from the RAF. However, he may have continued on instructing duties until 1944. After the war, he was involved in efforts to illegally export fighter aircraft to Palestine. He died in 1961 of leukaemia. Early life Brian John George Carbury was born in Wellington on 27 February 1918, the son of Herbert Carbury, an Irish immigrant who was a veterinarian and worked with horses. He later moved the Carbury family to Auckland, and started specialising in the treatment of small animals. Carbury was educated at King's College but left after three years of schooling. He found employment selling shoes at the Farmers' Trading Company. Tiring of retail work, he headed to the United Kingdom in June 1937 to pursue a military career. He wanted to join the Royal Navy but on being told he was too old, he instead applied for the Royal Air Force (RAF) on a short service commission. Military career Accepted for the RAF, Carbury began training in September 1937 and later in the year was appointed an acting pilot officer. His first posting, in June 1938, was to No. 41 Squadron which was based at Catterick in Yorkshire and operated the Hawker Fury bi-plane fighter. His pilot officer rank was confirmed a few months later. The squadron began converting to Supermarine Spitfires in January 1939. In August, Carbury was posted to RAF Turnhouse near Edinburgh, Scotland, to join No. 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron of the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) as a training officer. Being an AAF squadron, the pilots of No. 603 Squadron were weekend 'part-time' airmen from Edinburgh and the surrounding area. Carbury's work, as a by now experienced Spitfire pilot, was to help the amateur airmen convert to the aircraft. As war approached the squadron was mobilised and Carbury's posting, initially just temporary, was made permanent upon the outbreak of the war with Germany in September 1939. Second World War A Spitfire IIA restored in the colours of No. 603 Squadron as it appeared during the Battle of Britain No. 603 Squadron's first encounter with the enemy was on 16 October 1939, when the Luftwaffe mounted its first raid of the war on Britain. A section of the squadron had taken off to intercept bombers targeting shipping in the Firth of Forth and shot down a Junkers Ju 88 east of Dalkeith. The destroyed German aircraft was the first to be shot down over Britain during the Second World War. Another Ju 88 was badly damaged in the encounter and crashed in Holland. Carbury, although flying that day, was not involved in the action. In early December, Carbury was part of a detachment of No. 603 Squadron sent to Montrose to provide fighter cover there. In this role, he and two other pilots attacked a group of seven Heinkel He 111 bombers on 7 December. He claimed a damaged He 111, observing smoke coming from both engines of the bomber as it turned away although he was unable to pursue it due to a lack of fuel. On 18 January 1940, reunited with the main body of No. 603 Squadron which was now flying from the RAF station at Dyce, he claimed a third share in the destruction of another He 111. The squadron carried out patrols and training over the spring and summer of 1940. During this time, he was promoted to flying officer and also shared in the destruction of two more German bombers, a He 111 in March and a Junkers 88 in July. By this stage, the pilots of No. 603 Squadron were eager to join in the fighting over southern England. Among them was the Australian Richard Hillary, who on arrival at the squadron in early July, was greeted by Carbury and immediately invited to drinks in the mess. =Battle of Britain= No. 603 Squadron became involved in the Battle of Britain on 27 August 1940, when it redeployed to RAF Hornchurch to replace a battle weary No. 65 Squadron. Carbury flew two patrols the day after the squadron's arrival, encountering a group of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters on both occasions. He claimed a damaged Bf 109 but three of the squadron's pilots were killed. He claimed his first victory, a Bf 109, over Manston on 29 August. Another Bf 109 was shot down near Canterbury the next day. On 31 August, he flew three patrols. On the first, in the morning, he shot down a Bf 109, one of a group of 20 that the squadron encountered over Canterbury. On the second patrol carried out in the early afternoon, he and several other pilots attacked He 111s that were raiding Hornchurch. He shot down two of the bombers. Then, on the final patrol of the day, he destroyed two Bf 109s near Southend. His own aircraft was damaged in this encounter and he received an injury to his foot. His efforts of the day not only saw him become a fighter ace, but also one of only two pilots of the RAF to be credited with destroying five enemy aircraft in a day during the Battle of Britain. On 2 September Carbury claimed a Bf 109 as destroyed. Now officially credited with at least eight enemy aircraft destroyed, his exploits were recognised by the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). The award was gazetted on 24 September 1940, and the published citation read: On 7 September the Luftwaffe mounted its first large scale daylight bombing raid on London. No. 603 Squadron caught part of the bombing formation on its return flight to France and Carbury shot down an escorting Bf 109 and damaged two bombers. He damaged a He 111 on 11 September and destroyed a Bf 109 on 14 September, near London. Towards the end of the month, the pace of the aerial fighting began to slow down with the Luftwaffe changing its tactics by using Bf 109s in a fighter-bomber role for daylight attacks. Carbury's next victory did not occur until 2 October, when he shot down a Bf 109 over the Thames Estuary. He destroyed another over southeast London on 7 October. Flying a patrol on 10 October as the leader of a section of three Spitfires, he spotted a group of 20 Bf 109s returning to northern France. Leading the section into attack, he shot down one of the Bf 109s into the English Channel and a second on to the beach at Dunkirk. On 14 October, he damaged a Junkers Ju 88. By the end of October 1940, Carbury was officially credited with victories, the fifth highest scoring RAF pilot of the Battle of Britain. He was awarded a bar to the DFC he had received the previous month, one of only a few pilots so recognised during the period of the battle. The award of the bar was gazetted on 25 October 1940, the citation reading: =Move to the North= At the start of December 1940, No. 603 Squadron moved to the RAF base at Rochford, near Southend, for two weeks before shifting to Scotland, based at Drem. On Christmas Day, Carbury took off in pursuit of a Ju 88 bomber flying off St Abb's Head. The German aircraft made for home after Carbury inflicted some damage. At the end of the year, he was posted to No. 58 Operational Training Unit, based at Grangemouth, as an instructor and did not fly operationally in combat again. By this time, in addition to his confirmed kills, he was also credited with two probables and five damaged enemy aircraft. He was the seventh highest scoring New Zealand fighter ace of the Second World War. In October 1941 Carbury was charged with fraud after being accused of passing false cheques. His wife had expensive tastes and incurred bills that he could not pay. It was also alleged that he had deserted and misrepresented his rank by wearing the markings of a flight lieutenant. He was courtmartialled and dismissed from the RAF, a punishment announced in the London Gazette on 21 October 1941. According to aviation historian Kenneth Wynn, he continued on instructing duties until 1944. He divorced his wife and later remarried. Later life After leaving the RAF, Carbury continued to live in England. In 1949, he was involved with an effort to provide military equipment to Palestine. He was reportedly paid ¬£500 to deliver a Bristol Beaufighter to Palestine and flew it there from England, with stops at Corsica and Yugoslavia. Afterwards he was charged with the illegal export of the Beaufighter and fined a total of ¬£100. Three co-offenders received the same sentence. He later worked in London for a heating and ventilation company. He died of leukaemia on 31 July 1961 at Bourne End in Buckinghamshire, survived by his second wife and a son.

History Wulagi is one of Darwin's northern suburbs east of Lee Point Road and was built after Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin, Northern Territory in 1974. The name originates from an Aboriginal tribe on the Blyth and Cadell Rivers in Central Arnhem Land.http://www.australiaforeveryone.com.au/nt_names1.htm Development of the area was primarily during the 1970s and 1980s. Like the neighbouring suburb of Anula, Wulagi is largely built on a plateau with a downhill slope on its east side. The suburb was designed as a low-density, low-traffic suburb with pedestrian access facilitated by a number of laneways and a 'green-belt' that runs from Wulagi Primary School and the central shopping area westwards. Wulagi Primary School is an open-plan public school centred on a library space. A co-located Early Learning Centre caters for children from 6 weeks to 5 years. With the exception of Wulagi Crescent, the streets in Wulagi are named after birds found in the Northern Territory. Wulagi is a popular location in the Darwin suburbs for its large block size and green areas, and convenience to key locations such as Darwin Airport and Casuarina Beach. Wulagi is not greatly exposed to storm surge from tropical cyclones. Present day Between the 2006 and 2011 censuses there was a marked increase in the 60+ age group, reflecting a more settled population in the area. The great majority of residences are the original, robustly built post-Cyclone Tracy houses, but, with an increasing proportion of private ownership, frequently have had significant renovation and expansion. Common housing changes include the replacement of gravity-fed solar hot water systems with mains pressure driven solar systems, the installation of solar panels, and (facilitated by the relatively large block size) the development of significant outdoor areas including swimming pools. Wulagi Oval, which has a concrete cricket pitch and Australian Football League goal posts, has a well shaded perimeter and is well used. It is very common to see a club cricket game at Wulagi Oval on a Saturday. Wulagi Shopping Centre has, as of 2013, a general store, a wedding shop, a vet, and a fish & chips and general takeaway store.

The supporting cast includes Charles Bronson as Fierro, Herbert Lom as Huerta and Alexander Knox as Madero. Sam Peckinpah wrote the original script and was set to direct, but Brynner disliked like Peckinpah's harsh depiction of Villa and had Robert Towne rewrite the script, with Kulik brought on as director. The screenplay is based on the biography by William Douglas Lansford. Premise Pulled into the Mexican Revolution by his own greed, Texas gunrunner and pilot Lee Arnold (Mitchum) joins bandit-turned-patriot Pancho Villa (Brynner) and his band of dedicated men in a march across Mexico battling the Colorados and stealing women's hearts as they go. However, each has a nemesis among his friends: Arnold is tormented by Fierro (Bronson), Villa's right-hand man, and Villa must face possible betrayal by his own president's naivet√©.

Reception Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review, writing, \\"You would think an interesting picture could be made about Pancho Villa and the Mexican Revolution, a subject most Americans know next to nothing about. But we learn nothing except that Pancho was a romantic fellow who had a mustache and liked to have people lined up three in a row and killed with one bullet. (That scene, incidentally, got a big laugh.) Frankly, this kind of movie is beginning to get to me. You can enjoy one, maybe, or two. Or you can enjoy a particularly well done shoot-em-up. But the Loop has been filled with one action-adventure after another for the last month, and if Villa Rides is not the worst, it is certainly not the best.\\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun-Times, film review, June 25, 1968. Accessed: June 21, 2013. Film critic A. H. Weiler wrote, \\"Yul Brynner, Robert Mitchum, cavalry, politicos and even the faint strains of \\"La Cucaracha\\" fail to disguise the fact that Villa Rides which dashed into the Forum Theater yesterday, is simply a sprawling Western and not history. As such it incessantly fills the screen with the din of pistols and rifles, and assorted warfare and wenching, shot in sharp color on rugged Spanish sites that strikingly simulate Mexico. Any resemblance to the 1912-1914 campaigns of the bandit-revolutionary in the cause of liberal President Madero and against General Huerta is purely coincidental.\\"Weiler, A.H.

Germinal (◊ñ◊©◊¢◊®◊û◊ô◊†◊ê◊ú, also transliterated as Zsherminal) was a Yiddish-language anarchist journal in London edited by the German-born Rudolf Rocker. It appeared from 1900 to 1903, and then again from 1905 to 1908. In 1898, the Yiddish anarchist newspaper Arbeter Fraynd hired Rudolf Rocker, a non-Jew, who had just started learning the language, as its editor. However, despite an intervention by Emma Goldman and the devotion of many activists trying to save the paper, it had to be shut down for financial reasons in January 1900. Yet, the Jewish anarchists who published Arbeter Fraynd were unwilling to be left without any means of spreading their message. Therefore, Rocker, with the assistance of a young printer known as Narodiczky, founded the sixteen-page journal, which was published every fortnight and named after √âmile Zola's novel of the same name. Compared to Arbeter Fraynd, it was directed at a more intellectual audience and dealt with philosophy and literature using libertarian concepts to analyse them. In 1903, it also had to stop publication for lack of money. pp. 243-244; pp. ?196. In January 1905, Germinal was revived by Rocker and his comrades. The Jewish anarchist labour movement in London was on the rise, so the journal was able to reach a demand of 2,500 by the following year, when it was expanded to forty-eight pages. Publication of Arbeter Fraynd had resumed in 1903, so Germinal now had the role of the more intellectual equivalent of that newspaper, which was the more widespread of the two.Fishman 1974, pp. 261. The journal's influence reached far beyond London. Most cities in the world with a considerable recent Russian or Polish Jewish settlement had Germinal readers: most of the larger cities in the United States, Paris, Berlin, Bucharest, Sofia, Cairo, Alexandria, Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Buenos Aires. Alexander Granach, one of the leading actors of Weimar Germany, was introduced to the world of literature by Germinal.Fishman 1974, pg. 244.

Prior to 1927, the Route 2 designation had been applied to a highway from the Texas state line near Carlsbad to Route 1 in Santa Fe. After 1927, State Road 2 ran from the Texas line southeast of Malaga to the Colorado border northeast of Chama. This newer routing replaced the original Route 8 between Santa Fe and Espa√±ola and Route 36 from Espa√±ola to Colorado. NM 2 was approximately 425 miles long. In the mid 1930s, it was decommissioned and replaced by US 285. In the early 1950s, US 285 was rerouted south of Roswell. NM 2 was recommissioned along the older routing.

The company was made public in 1947. These were boom times for Golden Fleece and expansion and acquisitions were the trend throughout the 1950s and 1960s. H.C. Sleigh Limited acquired the fledgling \\"Kangaroo\\" and \\"Phillips 66\\" brands in 1962 and 1967 respectively. During these years, many (if not most) Golden Fleece service stations became roadhouse-style outlets with restaurants and bold signage. Some time during the 1960s or 1970s Golden Fleece gained a major contract by the, then small, major trucking company Linfox, that is still held by Caltex Australia today, due to a friendship between Regional Manager for Victoria Max Collins and Lindsay Fox. The company never had its own oil refinery and depended on Caltex to facilitate the importation and refining of crude oils at Kurnell Refinery in Sydney on its behalf. In the late 1970s the industry started to mature and rationalise due to soaring crude oil prices, and Federal Government oversight of petrol and diesel prices which was a subtle form of price control. Inevitably Golden Fleece was itself acquired by Caltex in 1981 and no longer trades under that name, though its unique livery can still be seen on some older roadhouses in rural Australia. A particular treasure for collectors are the globes (in the shape of the Golden Fleece ram) that sat atop the company's pumps until the 1970s, when the pumps were standardised.Caltex absorbs Golden Fleece Canberra Times 16 March 1981 page 6 Purr Pull was a brand marketed by Independent Oil Industries of Sydney.

Some were referred to as congresses while others used different terms for a similar type body. These bodies were generally renamed or replaced with other bodies when the provinces declared themselves states.  Overview  Colonial government in America was a systems of governance modeled after the British government of the time, with the king corresponding to the governor, the House of Commons to the colonial assembly, and the House of Lords to the governor's council.Bernard Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (1967); Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds. A Companion to the American Revolution (2003) Colonial assemblies did not believe that the British Parliament had authority over them to impose taxes (or certain other laws), that it was the colonial assembly‚Äôs duty to decide what should be imposed on their fellow colonists (the Massachusetts Circular Letter was an example of that argument). Legally, the crown governor's authority was unassailable, but assemblies began to resist efforts by some governors and royal officials to enforce acts of Parliament or to raise local taxes that governors demanded. In resisting that authority, assemblies resorted to arguments based upon natural rights and the common welfare, giving life to the notion that governments derived, or ought to derive, their authority from the consent of the governed. Committees of correspondence were formed as shadow governments in the Thirteen colonies prior to the American Revolution. During the First Continental Congress (in 1774), committees of inspection were formed to enforce the Continental Association trade boycott with Britain in response to the British Parliament‚Äôs Intolerable Acts. By 1775, the committees had become counter- governments that gradually replaced royal authority and took control of local governments. Known as the Committees of Safety, they regulated the economy, politics, morality, and militia of their individual communities.Alan D. Watson, \\"The Committees of Safety and the Coming of the American Revolution in North Carolina, 1774‚Äì1776,\\" North Carolina Historical Review, (1996) 73#2 pp 131‚Äì155 After the British Proclamation of Rebellion and the King‚Äôs speech before Parliament (27 October 1775) the colonies moved towards independence. Provisional governments began to create new state constitutions and governments. Committees of safety were a later outcome of the committees of correspondence. Committees of safety were executive bodies that governed during adjournments of, were created by, and derived their authority from provincial assemblies or congresses. In some colonies there were little or no changes to their assemblies until statehood. They had no need of a provisional legislative body since their governors did not dissolve or prevent the legislative assemblies from meeting. This was the case in the Charter colonies with more autonomy, such as Connecticut and Rhode Island, which elected colonial governors who were aligned with their assemblies. (Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull and Rhode Island Governor Nicholas Cooke served as both the last colonial governors and first state governors). The Delaware Colony was a proprietary colony under Governor John Penn of the Province of Pennsylvania, which included the ‚ÄúLower Counties of the Delaware\\", but it maintained a separate Delaware assembly. It was generally allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies.

Plot In the year 2445, a race of hostile aquatic aliens arrives on Earth. One of their ships sits at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, raising sea levels continuously for 5 years until almost 88% of the surface is submerged. In order to effectively fight the aliens, the fictional Earth Ocean Alliance develops the \\"Hydras\\", one-man submarine fighter craft. The player takes on the role of the last remaining fighter pilot. The objective is to travel through the alien-infested seas and fend off the targets long enough to complete the missions. The game ends with the player character planting a bomb inside an alien ship and driving away the remaining aliens. However, the player is trapped inside one of the vessels, and his fate is uncertain as the game concludes. Gameplay As in Rainbow Studios' other rail shooters The Hive and Ravage D.C.X., the player shoots targets that appear as live sprites in front of a full-motion video background. Occasionally, the video will stop and switch to a still background, which the player can pan around 360 degrees. The weapons include unlimited standard lasers and a limited supply of bombs.

At long, it begins at New York State Route 17 (NY 17) in Southfields and ends at Seven Lakes Drive in Harriman State Park. Arden Valley Road also serves a trout stocking area for the Ramapo River. The road is located entirely in Orange County and is home to the Elk's Pen Trailhead in Harriman State Park. In 1921, plans arose by the commission to construct the road, which was completed the same year and stretched along the borderline with the Harriman estate. Major William A. Welch ordered 75 elk from Yellowstone National Park to be placed in a wired cage between Arden and Southfields in 1919. The elk eventually disappeared from the pen by 1942, and the area became the current Elk's Pen trailhead for trails within Harriman State Park.  Route description  Arden Valley Road's eastern terminus at Tiorati Circle and Lake Tiorati. Arden Valley Road begins at an intersection with NY 17 in the hamlet of Southfields (within the town of Tuxedo). The road immediately becomes a part of the right-of-way for the Appalachian Trail, a roughly trail spanning the eastern United States. The road heads into Harriman State Park and crosses a pair of train tracks before passing over the New York State Thruway. The highway continues along the border of Harriman State Park; at the Elk's Pen Trailhead, the Appalachian Trail leaves Arden Valley Road and heads into the park. The road intersects with Island Pond Road, a dirt path in Harriman, as it heads along the border. Arden Valley Road intersects with Crooked Road thereafter. Harris Mine is visible to the left as the road proceeds around the base of Echo Mountain. To the southeast of Lindley Mountain, Arden Valley Road turns east and into the park. Arden Valley Road passes Lake Cohasset and Upper Lake Cohasset as it heads eastward. The road intersects with the Long Path and Ramapo-Dunderberg-Appalachian Trails soon afterward. Bradley Mine is visible to the left, and Arden Valley Road comes to an end at Tiorati Circle., where the road continues eastward as Tiorati Brook Road.  History  Arden Valley Road crosses the New York State Thruway just east of its western terminus at NY 17\\\\. Construction of the Arden Brook Valley Road, which intended to connect Lake Cohasset and the brand new Upper Cohasset Lake started around 1922, with money given by the New York State Legislature in 1921 Construction of the new road was completed in 1922, extending along the borderline with the Harriman estate. Originally, people to cross the Erie Railroad tracks and the Ramapo River to continue along Arden Valley Road. This was remedied by building an underpass under the Erie Railroad and a ford over the Ramapo River. When the New York State Thruway was constructed through the Hudson Valley in 1953, engineers included the ford in construction, and as of 1999, the structure still stands. In 1919, Major William A. Welch ordered 75 elk from Yellowstone National Park; however, some had died en route. The remaining elk were kept in a wired cage between Arden and Southfields. By 1935, some of the animals were still alive. However, by 1942, all of the elk had died. The remaining area is now known as the Elk's Pen Trailhead, which serves the Appalachian and Arden-Surebridge Trails. The remains of the pen still currently stand.

Description Cribrinopsis fernaldi is a large anemone that can be crimson red, orange or white. This species has zigzag transverse lines on its tentacles, white tubercles on its column, and spherules just below the tentacles. These spherules can be especially hard to see as they are often withdrawn. The column is up to in diameter and around high. The oral disk has yellow or pink lines radiating from the mouth to the margin. These can be difficult to see in dark red individuals.Kozloff, Eugene N. (1987).

U. crassicornis has transverse bands on the tentacles, but these are broad and straight, unlike C. fernaldi, which has thin zigzag transverse stripes. Additionally, the bands on U. crassicornis are fainter, appearing to be internal. In contrast, the bands on C. fernaldi appear to be superficial and are much bolder. U. crassicornis has column that is green mottled with red and C. fernaldi has a column that is red with regular white spots on tubercles.

Ct. H.R. (ser. A) (1989) is a landmark judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) which established that extradition of a young German national to the United States to face charges of capital murder violated Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) guaranteeing the right against inhuman and degrading treatment. In addition to the precedence established by the judgment, the judgment specifically resulted in the United States committing to not seek the death penalty against the German national involved in the case, and he was eventually extradited to the United States.  Background  The applicant, Jens Soering, is a German national, born in 1966, who was brought by his parents to the United States at age 11. In 1984, he was an 18-year-old Echols Scholar at the University of Virginia, where he became good friends with Elizabeth Haysom, a Canadian national two years his elder. Haysom's parents, William Reginald Haysom and Nancy Astor Haysom, lived from the university, in the then unincorporated hamlet of Boonsboro, in Bedford County, Virginia. According to the account provided later to local police, Soering and Elizabeth Haysom decided to kill Haysom's parents; and, to divert suspicion, they rented a car in Charlottesville and drove to Washington D.C. On 30 March 1985, Soering drove to the Haysom residence and dined with the unsuspecting couple. During or after dinner, he picked a quarrel and viciously attacked them with a knife. Both were found with their throats slit and with stab and slash wounds to the neck and body. In October 1985, Soering and Elizabeth Haysom fled to Europe; and, on 30 April 1986, they were arrested in England, United Kingdom on charges of cheque fraud. Six weeks later, a grand jury of the Circuit Court of Bedford County, Virginia, indicted Soering with the capital murder of the Haysoms, as well as their separate non-capital murders. On 11 August 1986, the United States requested extradition for the pair, based on the 1972 extradition treaty. A warrant was issued under section 8 of the Extradition Act 1870 for the arrest of Soering, and he was committed to await the Home Secretary's order to extradite him to the United States. Soering filed a petition for habeas corpus with the Divisional Court and requested permission for judicial review of the decision to commit him, arguing that the Extradition Act 1870 did not authorise extradition for a capital charge. He also cited article IV of the US-UK extradition treaty, which provides that an extradition request for an offence carrying the death penalty can be refused if the requesting country has not given \\"assurances [...] that the death penalty will not be carried out\\". No specific assurance was given by the United States, or the State of Virginia, that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty or that Soering would not be executed. The UK government received only an undertaking from the Commonwealth Attorney of Bedford County to the effect that:- Soering contended that this assurance was worthless. The Virginia authorities later communicated to the UK government that they would not offer further assurances, as they intended to seek the death penalty against Soering. On 11 December 1987, Lord Justice Lloyd in the Divisional Court admitted that the assurance \\"leaves something to be desired\\" but refused the request for judicial review, stating that Soering's request was premature, as the Home Secretary had not yet accepted the assurance. Soering appealed to the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, which rejected his claim on 30 June 1988. He, then, petitioned the Home Secretary without success, the latter authorising extradition on 3 August 1988. Anticipating this outcome, Soering had filed a claim with the European Commission of Human Rights (ECHR) on 9 July 1988, asserting that he would face inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (\\"the Convention\\") were he to be extradited to the USA, it being likely that the death penalty would be applied. Soering's arguments that the use by a non- Convention State of the death penalty would engage the right to life were novel, in that Article 2(1) of the Convention expressly permits the use of the death penalty, and Article 3 had never been interpreted to bring the death penalty, per se, within the prohibition of \\"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\". The applicant, therefore, sought to make it clear that this was not the simple application of a punishment prescribed by law, but rather his exposure to the death row phenomenon, where he would be kept in detention for an unknown period, awaiting execution. The ECHR requested that no extradition take place pending the deliverance of its judgment. Judgement =European Commission of Human Rights= Soering's application was declared admissible on 10 November 1988, and the European Commission of Human Rights gave its judgment on 19 January 1989. It decided, by six votes to five, that in this particular case the extradition would not constitute inhuman or degrading treatment. It did, however, accept that the extradition of a person to a country \\"where it is certain or where there is a serious risk that the person will be subjected to torture or inhuman treatment the deportation or extradition would, in itself, under such circumstances constitute inhuman treatment.\\" =European Court of Human Rights= On 7 July 1989, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) handed down a unanimous judgment affirming the Commission's conclusion that Article 3 could be engaged by the extradition process and that the extraditing state could be responsible for the breach where it is aware of a real risk that the person may be subject to inhuman or degrading treatment. Amnesty International intervened in the case and submitted that, in the light of \\"evolving standards in Western Europe regarding the existence and use of the death penalty\\", this punishment should be considered as inhuman and degrading and was therefore effectively prohibited by Article 3. This was not accepted by the ECHR, as the Convention does allow for the death penalty's use in certain circumstances. It followed that Article 3 could not stand in the way of the extradition of a suspect simply because they might be subject to the death penalty. However, even if the extradition itself would not constitute a breach of Article 3, such factors as the execution method, the detainee's personal circumstances, the sentence's disproportionality to the gravity of the crime, and conditions of detention could all violate Article 3. To answer this question, the Court had to determine whether there was a \\"real risk\\" of Soering's being executed. The Court found that Departing from the Commission's ruling, the ECHR concluded that the \\"death row phenomenon\\" did breach Article 3. They highlighted four factors that contributed to the violation: * The length of detention prior to execution * Conditions on death row * Soering's age and mental condition * The possibility of his extradition to Germany As the ECtHR concluded: Aftermath The UK government obtained further assurances from the US regarding the death penalty before extraditing Soering to Virginia. He was tried and convicted of the first degree murders of the Haysoms and, on 4 September 1990, sentenced to two consecutive life terms. He is serving his sentence at the Buckingham Correctional Center in Dillwyn, Virginia. Elizabeth Haysom did not contest her extradition from the UK and pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill her parents. On 6 October 1987, the court sentenced her to 45-years-per-count to be served consecutively. She is serving her sentence at the Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women. Significance Soering v. United Kingdom is important in four respects: * It enlarges the scope of a state's responsibility for breaches of the Convention. A signatory State must now consider consequences of returning an individual to a third country where he might face treatment that breaches the Convention. This is notwithstanding that the ill-treatment may be beyond its control, or even that general assurances have been provided that no ill-treatment will take place. * By finding a breach of the Convention on the territory of a non-signatory State, the Court considerably expanded the obligation to its signatory States. Not only are signatories responsible for consequences of extradition suffered outside their jurisdiction, but this jurisdiction implicitly extends to actions in non-signatory States. The Convention also overrides agreements concluded with such States. * The rationale of the Court's judgment applies equally to deportation cases, where other articles of the Convention may apply, such as Article 6 (right to a fair trial), as seen in Othman (Abu Qatada) v. United Kingdom (2012). * The Court's approach to the death penalty, itself permitted by the text of the original Convention, may reduce its use by non-signatory States that seek to extradite suspects from signatory States. The decision makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the US and other capital punishment countries to extradite suspects on capital charges from signatory States, without giving assurances that the death penalty will not be executed.

It tells of the creation of the wooden puppet Pinocchio and some of his adventures on the way to becoming a real boy. The opera was commissioned by Opera North with Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the original production opened at the Grand Theatre in Leeds on December 21, 2007. It starred Victoria Simmonds as Pinocchio, Mary Plazas as the Blue Fairy and Jonathan Summers as Mister Geppetto. It was directed by Martin Duncan, conducted by David Parry, designed by Francis O'Connor and choreographed by Nick Winston. The production included some ingenious technical stage effects, and used a full symphony orchestra including two accordions (which appear briefly on stage), a piano, and assorted percussion. The opera received its German premiere in Chemnitz in 2008 with Inga Lampert in the title role; the North American premiere was by the Minnesota Opera at the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts on February 28, 2009, with mezzo-soprano Adriana Zabala as Pinocchio; and the Russian premiere was at Teatr Sats, Moscow on November 18, 2011 with Giulia Macariants as Pinocchio. The work was recorded live at Sadler‚Äôs Wells Theatre, London, on 29 February & 1 March 2008, and was released on the Opus Arte label on Feb.1, 2009 in both DVD and Blu-ray formats.

Details  The HECI bus allows the host operating system (OS) to communicate directly with the Management Engine (ME) integrated in the chipset. This bi-directional, variable data-rate bus enables the host and ME to communicate system management information and events in a standards-compliant way, essentially replacing the System Management Bus (SMBus). The bus consists of four wires: a request and grant pair along with a serial transmit and receive data pair. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have historically provided active management technologies through the use of proprietary on-board controllers, such as Baseboard Management Controllers. These solutions typically suffer two main disadvantages due to their proprietary nature. High BOM costs are usually incurred due to the need for additional components and routing. High product lifecycle costs are incurred due to the non-standard implementation, which increases software and hardware design and validation costs while remaining relatively inflexible to future changes. On the other hand, the inflexibility is even greater with HECI due to coupling HECI with a chipset, and having to redevelop HECI software for each different chipset as opposed to one common BMC software for multiple chipsets. HECI and the previously used SMBus have the following aspects in common: the Host OS is able to control system management devices such as: on-board fan controllers, remote wake devices such as Wake-on-LAN, power supply devices such as Smart Battery Data. Builtin HECI functionality and third-party management cards can allow the Host OS to directly initiate management events (such as remote wake, or, out-of-band throttling to decrease thermal and power profile) in case HECI is supported by the running OS. Example devices are network cards and graphics cards. Besides that, both HECI and other ME technologies are chipset/ME vendor-specific.  Host-Initiated Messages  * Read battery status * Read thermal data * Enable/disable wake devices * Notify devices to change power state (thermal, performance, or power throttling)  Management Engine-Initiated Messages  * Alert Host to battery event  Low or Critical battery level  Switch between A/C (wall socket power) and D/C (battery) * Alert Host to thermal event (Hot or Critical thermal trip) * Change Fan Speed * Detect network wake * Boot/Shutdown System * Detected Host Intrusion * Change boot device * Report system inventory  Example  As an example, assume the case of Wake-on-LAN. Traditionally, the OS controls Wake- on-LAN and must call third-party device drivers to enable support on a network card. With the HECI bus, the host is able to assert its request line (REQ#), the ME will assert its grant line (GNT#), and the host can send its message using its serial transmit signal. Upon receipt of the Wake-on-LAN enable message on HECI, the ME directly enables Wake-on-LAN in the integrated (or externally supported) network device. Without HECI drivers in the OS, Wake-on- LAN functionality is lost even if standard network drivers would be able to enable it. This is a major problem in large-scale enterprise deployments with standard software images. When the magic wake packet is received by the LAN device, the encapsulated data is passed to the ME, which has its own TCP/IP stack and can decapsulate the packet. The ME then asserts its request line (REQ#), the host acknowledges by asserting grant (GNT#), and the message is passed to the host to initiate a wake event. With this technology, the magic packet may be encapsulated in TCP packets thus allowing the packet to traverse network infrastructures via routers and thereby increasing the attack surface, something which traditional Wake-on-LAN does not enable. An advantage in Intel-centric deployments is that the solution does not require non-Intel drivers. If no host/ME interaction is needed, HECI and other ME technologies are OS independent.

Born Dorcas Galley in Beverly, Essex County, Province of Massachusetts Bay, daughter of John and Florence Galley, she married William Hoar and was the mother of one son, named for his father, and two daughters. Her sisters were Mary Ross and Elizabeth Giles. A fortune teller and accused burglar, it appeared inevitable she would be named as a witch. She was ordered arrested on April 30, 1692, by magistrates John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin, after Jonathan Walcott and Thomas Putnam of Salem Village had made complaints that Hoar, Phillip English of Salem, and Sarah Murrell, also of Beverly, had afflicted Mary Walcott, Mercy Lewis, Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam, Jr., Elizabeth Hubbard and Susannah Sheldon. Marshal George Herrick delivered Hoar and Murrell to Ingersoll's tavern in Salem Village on May 2, but was unable to locate English, who had fled Salem. While imprisoned awaiting trial, Hoar confessed to acts of witchcraft to John Lovett, III, son of John Jr. and Bethiah (n√©e Rootes) Lovett. John was visiting his own grandmother, Susannah Rootes, who had also been accused of witchcraft and was awaiting trial.

He was an All-American in 1921 and was the team's captain in 1922. He played professional football from 1923 to 1926 with the Columbus Tigers, Chicago Bears, and New York Yankees. He was named to the NFL All-Pro team in 1923 and 1924. After his football career ended, he operated a sporting good store in Grand Rapids. He officiated football games for the Big Ten Conference for 16 years and also served in the U.S. Navy on an aircraft carrier in World War II. He was active in Republican Party politics in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and was one of the organizers of a reform movement to oust the city's political boss, Frank McKay. As an anti-McKay reform candidate, Goebel was three times elected mayor of Grand Rapids in the 1950s. He was later elected to the University of Michigan Board of Regents, where he served from 1962 to 1970. Goebel also played an important role in the career of U.S. President Gerald R. Ford. Goebel was friends with Ford's mother and stepfather and recommended Ford to head football coach Harry Kipke at the University of Michigan. When Ford returned from World War II, Goebel urged him to run for U.S. Congress and was part of the original Ford-for-Congress committee. Goebel was later the chairman of a committee formed in 1960 to name Ford as the Republican Party's Vice Presidential candidate on the ticket with Richard Nixon.  Football player at the University of Michigan  Goebel (left) and Jess Neely in 1922 Goebel enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1919. He studied engineering and received his degree in 1923. While at Michigan, he played football under head coach Fielding H. Yost. He played at the end where he developed a reputation as one of the country's best forward pass receivers and as a tenacious defensive player. At 6-feet, 3-inches, Goebel was a tall player in his era. He started seven games in each of the 1920 and 1921 seasons at right end for the Wolverines, and was limited due to injury to five games in 1922. In 1921, he was chosen as an All-American and was voted the captain of the 1922 team. Goebel also excelled as an honor student in the University's engineering school. Goebel also earned the Big Ten Conference Medal of Honor for proficiency in academics and athletics. = Goebel's steel knee brace = Prior to the 1922 season, Goebel \\"threw out his knee\\" and was fitted with a steel hinge ‚Äì an early version of a knee brace. However, the steel contraption required oiling and overheated when the oil dried, thus limiting Goebel's ability to play a complete game in 1922. One 1922 newspaper article described Goebel's knee brace this way: \\"To enable Goebel to play, the Michigan trainers devised a steel brace ‚Äì a hinge. This apparatus attached above and below the knee gave Goebel fairly good leg action because of the hinge. Before each game, Goebel liberally oiled the hinge to get free action because of the hinge.\\" Goebel's playing time was limited because \\"the constant action would dry the oil and then the steel would become so hot that Goebel could not continue playing.\\" During the 1922 game against Illinois, Goebel's skin was burned by the steel. = Dedication Day at Ohio Stadium = Despite the limitations of the knee brace, Goebel led the Wolverines to victory in the first game played at Ohio Stadium. The official \\"Dedication Day\\" for the stadium was October 21, 1922, and the opponent was Michigan. Ohio State fans recalled for years afterward how Goebel and his teammate Harry Kipke managed to turn Dedication Day sour for the Buckeyes. Michigan shut out the Buckeyes, 19‚Äì0, with Goebel and Kipke scoring all the points. In the first period, Goebel blocked a punt and then kicked a long field goal from the 30-yard line for the game's first points. He also penetrated into the Ohio State backfield in the second quarter to recover a fumble. As the game wore on, the Buckeyes \\"seemed to realize (Goebel's) importance in the Michigan lineup because he was forced to take plenty of punishment.\\" Football writer Billy Evans described Goebel's performance against Ohio State this way: > No end in recent years has played a greater game (than) that which Goebel > put up against Ohio State. For three periods Goebel was the mainspring of > the Michigan eleven. He seemed to be in every play. It was always Goebel who > was gumming things up for State. No man could go through an entire game at > the speed with which Goebel played in the first three quarters. It was > beyond the power of any human being. With a few minutes to play in the third > period the big fellow practically collapsed. Even when three or four of his > teammates were carrying him off the field the old spirit was still there. He > tried to induce his teammates that he was able to play, and tried to break > away from their grasp, but the punch was gone and he was forced to give way > as the big crowd cheered him to the echo. If any one man made possible the > defeat of State by Michigan, it was Captain Paul Goebel. The rotunda at Ohio Stadium is painted with maize flowers on a blue background due to the outcome of the 1922 dedication game against, an enduring tribute to Goebel's performance that day.The Five Greatest Traditions Of Ohio State Football, by Mike Furlan. Retrieved on November 20, 2006. Another writer summed up Goebel's 1922 season: \\"Captain Paul Goebel of Michigan has commanded no little attention this season. He is fast and furious. His particular forte lies in his ability to not only plunge in and break up the interference of the opposing team, but after so doing, nail the man with the ball and down him in his tracks.\\" = The tradition of the #1 jersey at Michigan = Goebel was particularly adept as a pass receiver. A 1923 wire service report in the Capital Times noted that Goebel was \\"considered one of the best ends in the country and his work on receiving forward passes hasn't been excelled on the gridiron.\\" In what would become a tradition at Michigan 60 years later, Goebel was the first All-American receiver at Michigan to wear the #1 jersey. Others to follow that tradition are Anthony Carter, Derrick Alexander, David Terrell, and Braylon Edwards. = The death of Bernard Kirk = Across the field from right end Goebel, Bernard Kirk played left end for the Wolverines in 1921 and 1922. Kirk was a talented player who was set to graduate with Goebel in 1923. However, Kirk died in an automobile accident on December 17, 1922. Goebel was a pall-bearer along with Harry Kipke, Frank Steketee, and other Michigan football players at Kirk's funeral in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Kirk had been a popular figure, and his funeral was covered widely in the national press, with Michigan Governor Alex Groesbeck, U-M President Marion LeRoy Burton, and the coaches of the Big Ten Conference football teams all in attendance. Goebel also served years later as a pall bearer at the funeral of his coach, Fielding H. Yost, in August 1946.  Professional football  In February 1923, Goebel refused an offer to become the head football coach at Wichita State University (then known as Fairmount College), saying he planned to enter the engineering profession after graduation. Instead, Goebel opted to play professional football. He played professional football for the Columbus Tigers from 1923‚Äì1925, the Chicago Bears in 1925, and the New York Yankees (the football team) in 1926. In his first year in the NFL, Goebel played in all ten of the team's games for the Columbus Tigers and was named to the All-Pro Team. He threw one touchdown pass and caught another. He was credited with eight points scored including two extra points. In 1924, Goebel was again selected as an All-Pro player with the Tigers, playing in ten games, making two touchdown receptions, and returning a fumble for a touchdown. In all, he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924. While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924, Goebel was involved in one of the oddest plays in NFL history. Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball popped out of his arms and was snatched out of the air by Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears. Knop began running for the goal line with the ball, but he was running the wrong way toward a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four-yard line. In 1926, Goebel played for the Yankees alongside Red Grange. After the close of the 1926 football season, he went to Los Angeles where he took a minor role in Grange's latest film. In May 1927, Goebel announced his retirement from professional football. He said he would devote his time to the sporting goods store he operated in Grand Rapids. Goebel had been playing professional football every season since he finished at Michigan.  Football official and sporting good businessman  After retiring from professional football, Goebel worked in his sporting good business in Grand Rapids, and also worked during football season as a game official for the Big Ten Conference. For 16 years between 1935 and 1952, he was a Big Ten football official. He also officiated in Rose Bowl, Notre Dame, and Army-Navy games. Goebel played a role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26‚Äì26, Ohio State threw an incomplete forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29‚Äì26 win in his final game. During World War II, Goebel served in the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Commander on an aircraft carrier. His final game as an official was the 1952 Rose Bowl between Illinois and Stanford, in which he was the head linesman. Goebel was also a fisherman, winning the title of Trout King at the National Trout Festival in 1949.  Relationship with Gerald R. Ford  Goebel played a key role in the football and political career of Gerald Ford, pictured in 1933 in Ann Arbor Goebel was a friend of Gerald R. Ford's mother and stepfather in Grand Rapids. Goebel played an important role in guiding Ford to the University of Michigan. When Ford graduated from Grand Rapids South High School, Goebel recognized Ford's ability as a football player and recommended him to his former teammate Harry Kipke, who had taken over as Michigan's head football coach. Kipke recruited Ford, who became Michigan's Most Valuable Player in 1934. In 1940, Goebel was part of a citizen's group in Grand Rapids seeking to overthrow Grand Rapids' political boss, Frank McKay. McKay had dismissed Ford's political interest in 1940, and this led to a long political alliance between Goebel and Ford. Ford went to work with Goebel as part of the anti-McKay citizen's group. Together, they organized the \\"Home Front,\\" the purpose of which was to throw out Boss McKay. Ford was elected president of the organization, his first experience in political organizing. Ford and Goebel both served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and after the war, Ford urged Goebel to run for Congress against the incumbent, an isolationist named Barney Jonkman. Goebel declined to run, but suggested to Ford that, \\"if you think he ought to be beaten, why don't you run?\\" Ford did run for Congress in 1948, and Goebel was one of his close circle of early supporters, the original Ford-for-Congress group. Ford won the election and won re-election for twelve more terms. In 1960, Goebel was a leader in the movement to nominate Ford as the Vice Presidential candidate on the ticket with Richard Nixon, serving as Chairman of the \\"Ford for Vice President Committee\\" at the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Goebel's son, Paul G. Goebel, Jr., ran for Ford's Congressional seat in 1974, then President Ford returned to Grand Rapids to campaign for Goebel's son. Ford delivered a speech at Calvin College in Grand Rapids the week before the election in which he said: \\"Paul Goebel I have known since he was just a lad. His dad knew me when I was back at South High‚Äîan inspired if not very competent football player. But I have known the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they are the kind of people who are dedicated to public service. Paul, Jr.'s, father was; Paul, Jr., himself is. And I have seen nothing but the finest in that family, and young Paul, he epitomizes all the great characteristics of that family.\\"  Political career  = Mayor of Grand Rapids = Goebel himself ran for office in 1950. He ran for mayor of Grand Rapids as part of the same anti-McKay reform movement that brought Gerald Ford to office. According to one newspaper account, Goebel \\"spearheaded a reform movement which brought him into office in 1950,\\" ousting incumbent George W. Welsh, who had been elected mayor five times and also served as the state's lieutenant governor. At the time, Goebel was the partner in a sporting goods store and was described in the press as tall and rangy, a candidate \\"who looks like a blond Abraham Lincoln without a beard.\\" Goebel was re-elected in 1952 for a second two-year term. In October 1953, Goebel announced he would not run for a third term, saying he had no further political ambitions and would devote his time to his family and business. Within a short time, however, he changed his mind and ran for a third term with the support of the reformist Citizens Action Group. In February 1954, Goebel received the most votes of any candidate in his third race for mayor (19,564 for Goebel to 10,831 for George Veldman), but he failed to secure a majority, and a runoff was held. Veldman defeated Goebel in the runoff by a margin of 203 votes. Goebel requested a recount, but he was unsuccessful. In 1956, he won re-election as mayor of Grand Rapids and served a final term from 1956‚Äì1958. In 1957, Goebel was included in published lists of potential candidates to run as the Republican candidate for governor. In January 1958, Goebel announced that he would not seek re-election as mayor. He said he had no plans to seek another political office. = University of Michigan Board of Regents = In 1962, Goebel returned to politics, winning a seat on the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, where he served from 1962‚Äì1970. In 1968, the Regents voted to eliminate curfews for all women students in residence halls and to allow each housing unit to set its own visitation hours. Goebel was the sole dissenter, saying: \\"If my judgment is proved wrong, no one will be happier than I.\\" In July 1970, Goebel announced that he would retire from the Regents at the end of his term on December 31, 1970. At age 69, he said the expected strain of another campaign influenced his decision. = Other civic and political roles = Through the 1950s and 1960s, Goebel also occupied himself with other civic and political projects, including serving as a member of the YMCA International World Service Committee in the 1960s, representing Governor George Romney and the State of Michigan at the 1965 Rose Bowl game, acting as chairman of the national committee of the University of Michigan in the mid-1960s to raise $55 million, acting as a delegate to Republican National Convention in 1956 and a delegate to Michigan state constitutional convention from 1961‚Äì1962, and serving as a member of Michigan Republican State Central Committee in 1969. He was also a member of the State of Michigan Higher Education Assistance Authority, Chairman of the State of Michigan Board of Ethics, Director of the U-M National Alumni Association and President of the Varsity \\"M\\" Club. Goebel was a Congregationalist and a member of the Freemasons, the Rotary Club, and Tau Beta Pi.  Family  Goebel's wife, Margaret Goebel, was a graduate nurse, a columnist for a Grand Rapids newspaper, and Chairman of Governor George Romney's Commission on the Status of Women. She also worked with the Grand Rapids Red Cross, the Council on World Affairs, the Urban League and was appointed by President Kennedy in 1962 to the Civil Defense Advisory Council. Goebel and his wife had two children. Their son Paul G. Goebel, Jr., was an aide to Rep. Gerald R. Ford and Vice President Richard M. Nixon. Paul Gobel, Jr., also operated an insurance business in Grand Rapids known as the Paul Goebel group.  Honors and accolades  Goebel's honors over the years include the following: * Selected as an All-American in 1921. * Voted captain of the 1922 Michigan Wolverines football team. * Named to the NFL \\"All-Pro\\" team in 1923 and 1924. * In 1968, several donors made gifts to the University of Michigan College of Engineering to establish an endowed chair for the Paul G. Goebel Professor of Engineering. The gifts came from donors who sought to honor Goebel for his contributions to the University. In April 1993, Yoram Koren was named as the Goebel Professor of Engineering. * In 1971, Goebel was given the Distinguished Alumni Service Award. The award, which is presented annually, recognizes alumni who have distinguished themselves \\"by reason of services performed on behalf of the University of Michigan, or in connection with its organized alumni activities.\\" The Distinguished Alumni Service Award is the highest honor the Alumni Association can bestow upon an alumna/us on behalf of the University. * Inducted into Grand Rapids Sports Hall of Fame in 1971. * In 1984, Goebel was the fourth recipient of the Ufer Award. Since 1981, the Ufer Award has been presented each year to a Letterwinners \\"M\\" Club member in recognition for his or her outstanding service to the University of Michigan Athletic Program. * Inducted into the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in 1981. Only seven football players (Bennie Oosterbaan, Gerald Ford, Tom Harmon, Willie Heston, Germany Schulz, Ron Kramer, and Benny Friedman) were inducted into the Hall of Honor before Goebel. * The U-M Club of Grand Rapids each year awards the Paul G.

Invitation Lyndon Johnson was in Karachi, Pakistan on behalf of President Kennedy as part of a goodwill mission, it was here that he met Bashir Ahmad in a group of camel drivers on a roadside. He pressed the flesh even patting the camels. He used a phrase he had regularly said in his travels, \\"Y'all come to Washington and see us sometime\\" but was completely surprised when the illiterate camel driver accepted his offer.https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/lyndon_johnson.pdf With the press hot on his heels after the acceptance, the vice-president took advantage of the People-to-People program to fund the Pakistani's travel expenses.Vice President Lyndon Johnson Another accountRuffles and Fourishes, Liz Carpenter p.33-37 indicates that Bashir was invited to the Vice President's ranch and that the surprise came not at the time (at least from her point of view), but the next day in the press. Ibrahim Jalis, a popular columnist in Pakistan, reported that everyone was excited by the fact that the vice president had invited Bashir to come to America. Perhaps, he had made the above reported statement while shaking Bashir's hand, leading to the misunderstanding that he had been invited. His column was favorable to Johnson, and contained the quote, \\"Don't conquer a country, don't conquer a government. If you wish to conquer, conquer the hearts of the people.\\" State visit Bashir was personally greeted by vice-president Johnson on his arrival in New York City, Bashir was then invited to Johnson's private ranch in Texas. During his week stay, the Pakistani was also taken to Kansas City, where he met ex-president Harry S Truman, who referred to him as 'your excellency', as well as to Washington D.C., where he was taken to the Lincoln Memorial, the Senate Floor, and to President Kennedy's office. Finally, at the end of his stay, as a gesture of further goodwill, vice-president Johnson made arrangements for Bashir to visit the Islamic holy city of Mecca on his return to Pakistan. This act of friendship brought tears to the eyes of the destitute camel driver. Liz Carpenter was Johnson's press secretary. According to Liz Carpenter's account, the press coverage of Bashir's visit was beginning to turn ugly. The vice president visited with several press representatives and convinced them in his trademark fashion to shape the nature of the coverage to avoid an embarrassing incident. One of the things that had been reported was that Bashir might not know about silverware. She reported that the problem was addressed in an interesting fashion. She says, \\"When we dined together, we had a menu that made it possible for all of us to eat with our fingers, such as fried chicken, stuffed celery, deviled eggs, potato chips. On one such occasion during a visit to Dallas, I looked around the table and saw the presidents of four banks and Neiman-Marcus all eating with their fingers to make the camel driver feel at home.\\" President John F. Kennedy noted about the visit, \\"I don't know how Lyndon does it. If I had done that, there would have been camel dung all over the White House lawn.\\" Johnson had taken a risk following through with the invitation, rather than trying to explain his way out of it, had managed the press coverage in an expert and somewhat lucky fashion, and had come out of the whole episode with added credit to his overall reputation. Escorted by Lady Bird Johnson and Luci Baines Johnson, Bashir visited James Madison High School in the Washington suburb of Vienna, Virginia and was cheered by hundreds of students as he addressed them through an interpreter. James Madison was selected because one of its students was Joy Youngblood, the daughter of Rufus Youngblood; Lyndon Johnson's head of security.

It is the highest elevation (4,449 ft/1,356 m) of Shavers Mountain, a ridge of the Alleghenies, and is located about east of Cheat Bridge. The Gaudineer Knob Lookout Tower, an important US Forest Service (USFS) fire tower, formerly occupied the crown of the knob. History The knob had been a prominent, but unnamed, peak in a vast wilderness when in the late 1930s it was named in memory of Donald Gaudineer, one of the USFS's early rangers in the Monongahela National Forest (MNF). As a young forester, Gaudineer had been assigned to the Southern District of the recently established MNF. His headquarters at that time occupied the former Craig Lumber Company office at Thornwood. During his years as ranger for the Greenbrier District, Gaudineer oversaw reforestation projects, the building of roads to enhance wildfire protection, the erection of fire towers in his district, and various other routine forest management activities. In the mid-1930s Gaudineer was transferred to the Cheat Ranger District, at Parsons, and on April 27, 1936, he was killed while attempting to rescue his children from a house fire. The USFS selected the scenic peak east of Cheat Bridge (in his former ranger district) as a fitting memorial. =Gaudineer Knob Lookout Tower= Only the concrete footers remain from the fire tower that from 1936 through the 1970s surveyed the forest landscape surrounding Gaudineer Knob. Gaudineer Scenic Area The Gaudineer Scenic Area is situated immediately north of Gaudineer Knob at about elevation. It was established in 1964 and was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1974 owing to a virgin red spruce stand that was spared the lumberman's saw when the surrounding countryside was clear-cut in the early 20th century.

The Madras Sappers were the only regiment of the Madras Presidency Army to survive unscathed the extensive reorganisations that took place between 1862 and 1928. The thambis, as the troops of the Madras Sappers are popularly known, with their hallmark Shakos have distinguished themselves in many battlefields around the world for more than 200 years. The Bangalore torpedo, a mine clearing explosive device, was invented in the Centre at Bengaluru in the early years of the Twentieth Century.

The newly raised army of the Madras Presidency was deficient of combat pioneers who were raised as 'ad hoc' companies and disbanded after the conflicts. The First Anglo-Mysore War highlighted this deficiency and led to the raising of two companies of the Madras Pioneers on 30 September 1780 at Fort St George. These men are the forefathers of the Madras Engineer Group of today and the Corps of Engineers of the Indian Army. The Madras Pioneers formed an integral part of the armed forces. Their principal job in active warfare was to dig 'saps' or 'trenches' which permitted cannon to be brought in range of enemy fortifications and to dig 'mines' which would explode creating a breach in the fort walls. Hence the name, Sappers & Miners. In addition, the sappers used to lead the way to the breach for the 'forlorn hope' and infantry to follow. They also built roads, bridges, fortifications, wells, water-supply and fought as infantry when needed. Since this group was constituted by the Madras Presidency, and formed part of the Madras Army, they were called the Madras Sappers. Likewise in 1803 and again in 1824, the Bengal Sappers and Bombay Sappers were formed in the other presidencies. The Madras Sappers recruited and trained small tough and wiry men from South India. These engineer troops fought in numerous campaigns in India at Sholinghur, Srirangapatna, Assaye (along with Major General Arthur Wellesley, later Duke of Wellington), and also in Egypt, China, Burma and other places abroad. The Madras Sappers moved into Bengaluru in 1834, when they were involved in a major part of the construction activities of the Civilian and Military buildings in Bengaluru. Their association with Bengaluru, where the Centre is located, continues to this day. The motto of the Madras Sappers is that common to all three regiments of the Corps of Engineers, Sarvatra (Sanskrit:Everywhere) the Indian equivalent to 'ubique', the motto of the Royal Engineers.

Elizabeth Zimmer of The Village Voice wrote, \\"In over a decade of watching Wave Hill events, I‚Äôve never had such a good time. It really was perfect.\\" The piece has also been performed at Gilsland Farm Audubon Sanctuary, Falmouth, Maine, in 1997, commissioned by the Bates Dance Festival; Wave Hill, Bronx, New York in 2001, co-commissioned by Dancing in the Streets and Wave Hill; Dartmouth College, commissioned by the Hopkins Center, Hanover, New Hampshire, in 2003. They have also collaborated with composers on work which included music created and performed live by Robert Een, Andy Teirstein, Philip Hamilton, Carman Moore, and Carter Burwell, who created \\"one of the finest scores for modern dance\\" (Back Stage) for \\"The Return of Lot‚Äôs Wife\\". In 2007-08 they brought \\"Katrina, Katrina: Love Letters to New Orleans\\" to Washington DC, New Orleans, Saratoga Springs, and Atlanta. They also developed a new company/concert stage work \\"Sayonara, Martha\\", and created the site-specific performance project \\"Paradise Pond\\" in celebration of the Bates Dance Festival‚Äôs 25th anniversary, with original music by Robert Een. The year included a New York performance season at the Thalia at Symphony Space, a choreographic residency with the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle; and creative residencies in Switzerland, India, and upstate New York. In August 2009 Pearson and Widrig joined the Dance faculty at the University of Maryland, College Park, where they teach choreography and performance. Their 2010 schedule included a 12-performance, 8-venue tour of \\"Unmoored: Love Letters to New Orleans\\" featuring the Pearson-Widrig Dance Theater and 12 University of Maryland dancers. In May 2011 they are teaching choreography in China at Beijing Normal University. In 2014,PearsonWidrig DanceTheater traveled to St. Petersburg, Russia, for a two-week residency and performances at the OPEN LOOK Festival. In 2016, PearsonWidrig DanceTheater traveled to Cuba. They engaged in two weeks of cultural exchange, collaborating with the Rosario C√°rdenas Dance Company and Cuban dancers and musicians on a new site- specific performance in Old Havana. They also taught free workshops open to the public, and offering a free concert of our choreography and PWDT dance artists Tzveta Kassabova, Lindsay Gilmour, Graham Brown, and apprentice Jonathan Hsu.

The plant can grow in a range of temperatures, moisture levels, and soil types, and in many types of habitat, including fields, pastures, grasslands, roadsides, railroads, and dump sites. It is not invasive in its native range, but in regions where it has naturalized, such as the rangelands of the western United States, it can negatively affect native flora through competition, reduce the quality of forage, and increase soil erosion. The plant can form wide stands in fields. It is unpalatable to most grazing animals, which avoid it and selectively consume other grasses and herbs, allowing the weed to survive and spread. Sheep and goats will consume the plant, but are not effective agents of eradication. A number of natural enemies have been recorded, such as the mite Aceria balasi, which attacks the inflorescence, the moths Clytie illunaris, Metzneria aprilella, and Ornativalva plutelliformis, which feed on the seeds, and the weevil Styphlus penicillus, which feeds on the leaves. Ramularia crupinae, first described from the plant, is a pathogenic sac fungus that grows on its leaves. No agents of biological pest control have been established.

On April 29, 1999, Queen Beatrix appointed her Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. She has appeared on many children's television programs and is best known for her Indo (Dutch-Indonesian) character of Tante Lien in The Late Late Lien Show on Dutch prime time television. Her show was the only television programme ever to showcase Indo (Eurasian) culture and introduced many Indo artists and music to mainstream audiences in the Netherlands. After three seasons the television series ended in 1988, but her Tante Lien character is popular to this day and in 2007 she was awarded the Silver Medal of Merit for her contributions in this role from the Dutch State Secretary for Defence.Dutch Veterans Website Early life Wieteke Van Dort was born in Surabaya in what was then the Dutch East Indies under the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. While there, she attended two primary schools, and began attending the HBS. When she was thirteen years old, the Van Dort family went on vacation to The Netherlands. While they were abroad, Sukarno nationalized Indonesia and the Van Dort family lost everything. Her family settled in The Hague. In The Hague, she left middle school without a diploma. Because she was too young for the academy of dramatic arts, she first underwent training to become a nursery school teacher. Although she did not receive a diploma, she did complete three years of HBS. In 1962 and 1963, she attended Toneelgroep Rederijkers (the academy of dramatic arts). While at the academy, she played Laura Wingfield in a performance of The Glass Menagerie. In 1964, she dropped out of the academy and signed a contract with the Nieuwe Komedie. In 1968, she began working with Wim Kan and Corry Vonk as a comedian. Early career 125px After her marriage to Theo Moody, she concentrated with much success on radio and television. In De Stratemakeropzeeshow with Aart Staartjes and Joost Prinsen, she played the 'distinguished lady'. In the 1970s, she appeared on the children's program Lawaaipapegaai. The writer's collective consisted of Hans Dorrestijn, Karel Eykman, Ries Moonen, Fetze Pijlman, Jan Riem, during which time Willem Wilmink (a scriptwriter) died. Wieteke van Dort also participated in the television program Het Klokhuis by overseeing the text in the scriptwriting collective. Tante Lien Her most successful character is Tante Lien, which she introduced through her popular television programme The Late Late Lien Show. She had to push hard to get the concept produced as the TV production companies and broadcasters initially did not believe there was a market for this. Eventually three seasons were aired in 1979, 1980, 1981 and finally in 1988. The show became the only platform ever for Indo culture on national television. Each episode shows funny, old Tante Lien hosting a cosy gathering (Koempoelan) at her home in which she and her guests snack on Indo food and reminisce about life back in the good old days (tempo doeloe) of the Dutch East Indies. Her guests are usually famous Indo and Totok (full blooded Dutch settlers of the colonial Dutch East Indies) artists that perform solo or together with Tante Lien or each other. Artists that have appeared in the show include the Blue Diamonds, Sandra Reemer and Willem Nijholt. Late Late Lien Show on Imdb Within the Indo community itself the show was viewed by some to be rather controversial, mainly due to the fact the Tante Lien character speaks Dutch with a strong Indo accent. Certain factions in the Indo community claimed this as the reason they could not identify with the show and considered it not representative of well educated and assimilated Indos. In one episode the show makes fun of this criticism by having a posh speaking Indo woman party crash Tante Liens gathering. Late career In the parliamentary elections of 1994 she was fourth on the list of the Natural Law Party. On June 29, 2007, during the official Dutch Veterans Day in the Hague, Wieteke van Dort received the Silver Medal of Merit from the Minister of Defence for her role of Tante Lien in which she has performed on veterans' gatherings for over thirty years. \\"Through her efforts she highlights our solidarity and strengthens the bond between Dutch society and the ex-soldiers making a substantial contribution to the welfare of veterans. In her performances she also bridges the gap between the older and younger veterans.\\".Dutch Veterans Website In 2008 she starred in the feature film Santa Claus and the Secret of the Great Book by director Martin Nellestijn. In 2009 she played the role of Queen in the film Santa Claus and the Lost Packet Boat from the same director. Van Dort often cooperates with benefits and non- profit events for good causes. In 2010 she voluntary contributed to music made to relief women suffering from the loss of a baby, just before, during or soon after birth. Wieteke van Dort is still active in the fine arts and regularly performs her popular character Tante Lien. Her voice can be heard narrating the stories in the Dutch fairytale theme park Efteling.

Their studbook is kept by the Koninklijk Warmbloed Paardenstamboek Nederland (Royal Warmblood Horse Studbook of the Netherlands) or KWPN. The breed is based on the native Groningen and Gelderland horses, which were formerly indispensable in agriculture and transportation services. Strict selection procedures and a clear breeding aim enabled breeders to produce a refined, high-stepping horse within a few decades. While with 40 sires and fewer than 2,000 broodmares the population is not large, Dutch Harness Horses are highly recognizable. In the past few years, a handful have come to North America, where they are used as sport horses and saddle seat horses alike. Characteristics Dutch Harness Horse stallion exhibited in the USA The Dutch Harness Horse is distinctive among warmbloods for its high action, and gaining popularity among those saddle seat aficionados who seek a larger, more substantial horse. They are traditionally shown with a braided mane and natural tail, and when shown in-hand often wear a white bridle without a cavesson. The hooves are usually allowed to grow longer than a riding horse's feet, but are never shod with weighted shoes. While the colors black, brown, bay and chestnut are most common, there are greys, true roans, and creme dilutes. Tuigpaarden are often very well-marked, and many have extensive sabino or rabicano markings. There are even some tobianos, though they are rare. The expressive head is made up of straight lines and distinctly warmblood in type. It is usually narrow, long and quite dry, similar to the Saddlebred. The neck is set on quite high, and the shoulders are uniformly long and powerful. The carriage of the head and the level croup with high-set tail distinguish the harness horses from their riding-type relatives. The longer back, more open loin, and flatter croup enable the hindlegs and forelegs to work independently and with great action. By comparison, the harness horse appears to stand higher off the ground. Strict selection procedures mean that the Dutch Harness Horse is reasonably uniform in type and motion, and also means that the gait qualities of the horses are inherent. As the show horses are not asked to canter in harness, this gait receives less attention. The walk is diligent, but the trot is the true show gait. The forelegs are typically longer than the hindlegs - by design - and as such the horse will \\"sink\\" in the back and rise in the front. This quality is responsible for the powerful, active hind end and the great freedom in the forehand. These horses usually have a metronomic trot and ample suspension. In comparison to the riding horse type, the Tuigpaarden are more hot and sensitive to the energy of a crowd. However, with the control of the stallion inspections, bad-tempered horses or those with poor constitutions are at the very least identified, if not culled outright. A dangerous stallion would never obtain breeding permission in the first place, and so the breed is reactive and courageous, but pleasant and kind. This Tuigpaard, at a Flanders regional agricultural show, turned out for exhibition in-hand. Branding is now illegal in the Netherlands, so the lion-rampant brand of the KWPN appears on the left thigh of only older horses. Today, KWPN horses are microchipped instead. The letter which begins a Dutch Harness Horse's name corresponds to his year of birth. Daughters are often given only a very slight variation of the dam's name, for example: 1988 was the \\"G\\" year, so the daughter of a mare named \\"Zilvia\\" was \\"Gilvia\\". History The Dutch have a strong tradition of breeding driving horses, and during the late 19th century and early 20th century, these horses were known as \\"luxury horses.\\" They consisted of two separate breeds: northern Groningens which were heavier and primarily dark colors, and Gelderlanders from the south which were taller, leggier, and usually chestnut. They were elegant, though heavy, carriage horses which could work on the farm too. Naturally, horse owners felt competitive about whose horse or horses were the finest and most showy. This was not forgotten when mechanization made agricultural horses obsolete and the driving horses needed a new occupation. The Royal Warmblood Horse Studbook of the Netherlands or KWPN was founded in 1969 and from the beginning featured a distinct studbook for driving horses. Much of the development from heavy carriage horse to fine driving horse was completed within the native horse populations, however the influence of the Hackney stallion Cambridge Cole significantly helped the gene pool. Also influential was the chestnut American Saddlebred stallion, Immigrant (American Saddlebred Horse Association name Callaway's Mardi Gras), born in 1990. In comparison to his Dutch peers, his gaits were not considered impressive, but he did contribute his good character and dry type to the gene pool. Other Hackneys to cover Dutch Harness Horse mares were Marfleet Raffles and his son Grants Hornet, and Brook Acres Silversul. Currently the Hackney Horse stallions GTF Maker's Mark and Plain's Liberator are approved for use in Dutch Harness Horse breeding. A palomino American Saddlebred stallion, originally named Denmark's Golden Playboy, stood in the Netherlands as Holland's Golden Boy. Uses Dutch Harness stallion shod for in-hand exhibition in the United States While most Tuigpaarden are shown in special fine harness competitions, they have also made their mark in combined driving. Several of the teams at the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games were Dutch Harness Horses. A few have distinguished themselves in sport, rather than show, though they are the exception. Some of the successful sport Dutch Harness Horses include Constance Menard's Lianca and Anneke Muilwijk's Atuur, both of which compete in dressage. The Dutch Harness Horse is unique from other high stepping trotting breeds in that it has strict shoeing rules for competition, the shoes must be within a certain width and thickness and no pads are allowed. This insures that the breed is sound and able to trot so spectacularly on its own accord, not because of special shoeing. Of late, Dutch Harness Horses have been crossbred with Arabians in the United States to produce a more powerful horse for half-Arabian Saddle seat-style English pleasure, fine harness and \\"park\\" classes. Medical issues Prior to licensing, Tuigpaard stallions must undergo a thorough vet check. Any horse with defects of the genitalia or bite, sub-par semen analysis, or any evidence of a congenital disorder or defect is not permitted to breed. A horse which has had surgery to correct a congenital abnormality is likewise culled. Furthermore, the stallions and elite performance mares must undergo a thorough radiographic exam of their joints. Horses with evidence of OCD lesions do not pass. For these reasons, the breed is healthy, sound, and long-lived. The primary concern facing the breed is inbreeding, due to the small size of the gene pool.

Over 300 public interest groups across Canada have endorsed the mandate of the Campaign for Nuclear Phaseout (CNP). Some environmental organisations such as Energy Probe, the Pembina Institute and the Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility (CCNR) are reported to have developed considerable expertise on nuclear power and energy issues. There is also a long-standing tradition of indigenous opposition to uranium mining.Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power, Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 257.Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power, Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 279.  Emergence of the movement  The anti-nuclear movement in Canada began as a part of the overall peace movement within Canada. The impetus for the anti- nuclear movement can be ascribed to the threat of nuclear arms during the Cold War, and the ineffectiveness of the United Nations in resolving the political tensions. As a result of numerous incidents and pressures, multiple notable groups were established in Canada to fulfill this purpose, including: the Canadian Committee for the Control of Radiation Hazards, the Voice of Women, and numerous student organizations in the country.McMahon, Patricia I. 1999. ‚ÄúTHE POLITICS OF CANADA'S NUCLEAR POLICY, 1957-1 963 .‚Äù Thesis, Ottawa: National Library of Canada. University of Toronto. P. 139 The first Canadian organization established centered around nuclear concerns was the ECCRH (Edmonton Committee for the Control of Radiation Hazards). This society was formed in 1958 by Mary Von Stolk. She was introduced to the anti-nuclear movement through a social connection to the American National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. The purpose of the ECCRH wasn't the disarmament of nuclear weapons from the Canadian military, but rather they aimed to educate the public on the dangers of nuclear fallout produced by the usage of nuclear weapons. The Edmonton Committee for the Control of Radiation Hazards later changed its name to the Canadian Committee for the Control of Radiation Hazards, to reflect its growing national following, as well as aspirations to influence federal policy. Von Stolk now aimed to persuade Diefenbaker to reject nuclear weapons for the Canadian forces, as well as bring awareness to the organization's original goal of bringing awareness to the effects of nuclear fallout.McMahon, Patricia I. 1999. ‚ÄúTHE POLITICS OF CANADA'S NUCLEAR POLICY, 1957-1 963 .‚Äù Thesis, Ottawa: National Library of Canada. University of Toronto. P. 148 In addition to the CCCRH (Canadian Committee for the Control of Radiation Hazards), the Voice of Women was founded shortly after the U-2 Affair. Lotta Dempsey, a columnist for the Toronto Star, called for the formation of a group to oppose nuclear arms in response to the aforementioned U-2 Affair. They sought to lobby directly against nuclear armaments by approaching politicians directly, and establishing grassroots connections with women in other nations. They received an endorsement from Mrs. Pearson, who was the wife of the leader of the Parliamentary opposition, Lester B. Pearson.McMahon, Patricia I. 1999. ‚ÄúTHE POLITICS OF CANADA'S NUCLEAR POLICY, 1957-1 963 .‚Äù Thesis, Ottawa: National Library of Canada. University of Toronto. P. 161 Context According to a 2006 opinion poll commissioned by the BBC, 91 per cent of Canadians surveyed were \\"concerned\\" or \\"very concerned\\" that \\"the way the world produces and uses energy is causing environmental problems, including climate change\\" and 85 per cent were concerned (or very concerned) \\"that energy shortages and prices will destabilize the world economy\\". In terms of available energy options which may help to address these problems: > ...91% (of which 66% strongly) were in favour of \\"creating tax incentives to > encourage the development and use of alternative energy sources, such as > solar or wind power\\". Asked whether \\"building new nuclear power plants, to > reduce reliance on oil and coal\\" would be a good idea, 52% agreed (of which > 22% strongly) while 43% disagreed (of which 25% strongly). International nuclear policy consultant Mycle Schneider has reported that, as of June 2007, the overall lifetime load factor of the 22 Canadian nuclear reactors was 68.5%, which is quite a poor performance by global standards. The CANDU reactors have \\"experienced a large number of technical problems, several of which had significant safety relevance\\". Canada is the world's second largest producer of uranium (Kazakhstan is the largest producer, Canada was until 2008 World Nuclear) and has therefore accumulated very large amounts of mine waste. This waste amounts to \\"several hundred million tonnes and about 400 million cubic meters of contaminated process water\\". Algonquin tribe Members of the Algonquin tribe have been peacefully blockading a uranium mining operation on their sacred lands north of Kingston, Ontario since June 29, 2007.Algonquin Alliance Protest Update Other indigenous opposition against uranium mining has become a long-standing tradition, particularly in Saskatchewan. Campaign for Nuclear Phaseout The Campaign for Nuclear Phaseout (CNP) represents a coalition of Canadian public interest organizations concerned with the environmental impacts of nuclear power generation. CNP's mandate is supported by over 300 advocacy groups from across Canada.Campaign for nuclear phaseout In 2003, Campaign for Nuclear Phaseout commissioned the report Phasing Out Nuclear Power in Canada, which outlined a possible scenario where the central coal and nuclear plants in Ontario, Qu√©bec and New Brunswick could be phased out as they reach the end of their operational lifespan, to be replaced with a combination of more efficient energy use, expansion of combined heat and power technology, and deployment of renewable energy and distributed sources of power generation.Phasing Out Nuclear Power in Canada Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility CCNR is a non-profit organization, federally incorporated since 1978. It conducts education and research on issues related to nuclear energy, whether civilian or military (including non-nuclear alternatives), especially those pertaining to Canada. Its president is Gordon Edwards.Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility Greenpeace Canada Greenpeace Canada argues that nuclear power is an unacceptable risk to the environment and to humanity, and that the only solution is to halt the expansion of all nuclear power and to shut down existing plants. Greenpeace Canada believes Canada needs an energy system that can combat climate change, based on renewable energy and energy efficiency.End the nuclear threatPress releases Energy Probe Energy Probe is a consumer and environmental research team, which is opposed to nuclear power, and dedicated to resource conservation, economic efficiency, and effective utility regulation.Energy Probe Founded in 1970 as a sister project of Pollution Probe and incorporated in 1980 as EPRF Energy Probe Research Foundation, Energy Probe led the opposition to Ontario Hydro's nuclear expansion plans starting in 1974. Energy Probe's plans to break up Ontario Hydro's monopoly and end support for nuclear power were endorsed in 1984 by the leaders of the Ontario Liberal Party and the Ontario New Democratic Party, the two opposition parties at the time. Later, the Ontario Conservative Party led by Mike Harris formally adopted Energy Probe's positions in its Common Sense Revolution.The Common Sense Revolution Energy Quest 4 Nanticoke Energy Quest 4 Nanticoke was formed to raise awareness on energy options for the Ontario regions of Haldimand/Norfolk/Brant/Hamilton, as the county councils of Norfolk and Haldimand endorsed an Environmental Assessment on a nuclear reactor at Nanticoke without meaningful public debate.Grand Erie Energy Quest Inter- Church Uranium Committee Educational Co-operative The Inter-Church Uranium Committee Educational Co-operative (ICUCEC) is a church coalition that educates people about the nuclear industry in Saskatchewan and wants to halt all nuclear development in the province, including the mining of uranium.Inter-Church Uranium Committee Educational Co-operative Nuclear Free Great Lakes Campaign The Nuclear Free Great Lakes Campaign consists of eight safe-energy organizations from Canada and the United States dedicated to the cessation of radioactive contamination of the Great Lakes Basin, and the removal of nuclear power from the area. Peace River Environmental Society Peace River Environmental Society fought Bruce Power's plans to build a nuclear power plant in northern Alberta. In December 2011, the company abandoned its plan to build up to four nuclear reactors that could produce 4,000 megawatts of electricity at a site 30 kilometres north of Peace River. Pembina Institute The Pembina Institute is a Canadian not-for-profit environmental policy research and education organization specializing in the fields of sustainable energy, community sustainability, global warming and corporate environmental management. Founded in 1985, the Institute has offices in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Ottawa and Toronto. In 2006 the Institute released the report Nuclear Power in Canada: An Examination of Risks, Impacts and Sustainability.Nuclear Power in Canada Port Hope Community Health Concerns Committee The Port Hope Community Health Concerns Committee (PHCHCC) is an incorporated nonprofit community organization which aims to produce a comprehensive independent health assessment about long term exposure to radioactive and heavy metal contaminants from sixty years of nuclear industry operations in Port Hope, Ontario. Port Hope Families Against Radiation Exposure The Port Hope Families Against Radiation Exposure group consists of 1570 concerned residents of Port Hope who are monitoring the activities of the nuclear industry, following a 16-month campaign against the plans of Cameco Corporation to enrich uranium. Safe and Green Energy Peterborough In 2009, Safe and Green Energy Peterborough received $37,000 from a federal agency to review its study for the proposed Darlington Nuclear Power Plant expansion.Antinuclear group gets funding Save Our Saskatchewan Save Our Saskatchewan is a group of local residents opposed to nuclear development in Saskatchewan.Sask. group forms to oppose nuclear development Sierra Club of Canada The Sierra Club of Canada has been active in Canada since 1963 and a national office was established in Ottawa in 1989. There are active chapters in every region of Canada, with offices in Ottawa, Victoria, Sydney, Corner Brook, Halifax, Edmonton, Montreal and Toronto.Welcome to the Sierra Club of Canada!

He received international attention when he was imprisoned in Russian Central Asia by Bolshevik forces shortly after the Russian Revolution. Diplomatic career Tredwell had a variety of positions all over the world. In 1914 he was stationed in Bristol, England. In 1915 he served in Italy at Turin and then Rome.. By 1917 he was serving in Russia, at which time he went to Turkestan on a fact-finding mission and was imprisoned. In 1922 he began a three-year tour as United States Consul General at large for Central Asia and Africa.. From 1926‚Äì1929 he served in Hong Kong, marrying Metta-Louise Orr from New York in 1929.. He was then relocated to Stockholm in the early 1930s.Roger Culver Tredwell, The Political Graveyard. Imprisonment in Tashkent Cotton bales near Tashkent. In 1918 Tredwell was sent to Tashkent in Russian Central Asia to investigate the political and cotton situation there. At this time, World War I was still raging across Europe. Munitions of the day used cotton (see nitrocellulose), however a successful blockade by the British had limited Germany's cotton supply. The Entente powers were concerned that the Germans might try to procure local supplies throughout the former Russian Empire, especially in the Turkestan region, as well as rally political and military support in the area to launch an attack against British India. Tredwell prepared two reports during that summer after traveling extensively around the region and speaking to many people about the current political and economic situation. Tredwell was arrested by the Bolsheviks in on October 15, 1918. He was soon able to secure his release, and quickly set about to free other foreigners arrested that same day. Shortly after, however, he was placed once again under house arrest. At one point he was taken to a prison where it seemed he was about to be executed, but the local police chief stopped the process at the last minute.. In March 1919, the British offered to release Bolshevik prisoners they were holding in Persia in exchange for Tredwell's freedom.. This exchange, however, never took place.. He was taken from Tashkent to Moscow, then onward to Finland, where he was released in May 1919. Upon his return, he denounced Bolshevik rule and predicted that the Russian people would soon rise up against it.. During his time in Tashkent, Tredwell was acquainted with and assisted the British intelligence officer Frederick Marshman Bailey.

It was also used by the band Save Ferris for their own indie label, Starpool Records, which released the first Save Ferris EP, Introducing Save Ferris. History Starpool formed in early 2003 and played their first show at the Ska Summit in Las Vegas. The band released an EP in 2003 titled STRPL E.P.0001 before taking a hiatus in late 2004. In late 2006, the band resumed activity and began playing shows again. They released a single titled STRPL SNGL01 consisting of 2 new tracks in 2007. In 2010, the band released their first full-length album, Living in Transition. In 2010, drummer Phil Hanson moved his family to Denver, Colorado. In his place is former Save Ferris drummer Evan Kilbourne. Kilbourne played his first show with Starpool on September 18, 2010, at The Grove of Anaheim where the septet opened for fellow Orange County third wave ska legends, Reel Big Fish.

There are several small streams that flow into Clearwater Lake, but it has no significant tributaries.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . Formation The basin occupied by Clearwater Lake was scoured by glaciers during several ice ages, including the Wisconsin Ice Age which ended in this region about 10,000 years ago. The basin subsequently filled with meltwater, but its depth has never been measured reliably. The deepest point is believed to be just east of Diver's Bluff. When Dragon Cone erupted about 8,500 years ago, the lava flowed southwest to the Clearwater River, damming it to a height of and raising the level of existing Clearwater Lake just upstream. This flow is just one example of volcanic activity that has occurred in the Wells Gray- Clearwater volcanic field during the last 500,000 years.Catalogue of Canadian Volcanoes - Wells Gray - Clearwater volcano field Hickson, Cathie with Hollinger, Jason (2014). Wells Gray Rocks. Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops, BC Osprey Falls occurs where the Clearwater River empties out of Clearwater Lake. The waterfall is the height of the lava dam, but is over wide along an L-shaped brink. Osprey Falls is very hazardous to boaters on Clearwater Lake because of the strong current in the southern .

Wells Gray Park's largest campgrounds, Clearwater Lake and Falls Creek, are adjacent to Osprey Falls and have 80 sites total. Lake tours and a water taxi service operate from near the campgrounds. The public boat launching ramp is further up the lake. A trail follows the lakeshore from the water taxi dock to the public boat launch. It continues for , then climbs away from the lake to a viewpoint above the Easter Bluffs. At the north end of Clearwater Lake, a portage trail provides access for canoeists and kayakers to nearby Azure Lake. The Hobson Lake trail also starts here and is long; it is a rigorous trail and hikers must ford Lickskillet Creek above Sundt Falls as the bridge washed out in 1998. Some older maps show a trail to Azure and Zodiac Mountains from the east shore of Clearwater Lake, but this trail is no longer passable. Seven campgrounds with a few sites at each are located along the east and west shores of Clearwater Lake. The only access is by boat. Naming The Overlanders expedition to the Cariboo goldfields rafted down the North Thompson River in 1862. When they arrived at the mouth of the Clearwater River, they noted its distinct clarity compared to the muddy North Thompson and named it Clear Water. The lake was probably seen by white prospectors in 1866 and the river's name was extended to the lake.

The first steam cannon was designed by Archimedes during the Siege of Syracuse . Leonardo Da Vinci was also known to have designed one (see the Architonnerre). The early device would consist of a large metal tube, preferably copper due to its high thermal conductivity, which would be placed in a furnace. One end of the tube would be capped and the other loaded with a projectile. Once the tube reached a high enough temperature, a small amount of water would be injected in behind the projectile. In theory, Leonardo da Vinci believed, the water would rapidly expand into vapour, blasting the projectile out the front of the barrel. Age of steam Various unsuccessful efforts were made during the age of steam to create working steam machine guns and cannons using methods and technology derived from steam locomotives. Experimental prototype of 17.5 mm steam cannon. Russian Empire, 1826‚Äì29. In 1826‚Äì29, a 17.5 mm bore experimental steam gun was developed by Colonel Karelin of the Imperial Russian corps of communications . The barrel was of green copper in a red copper casing. it was capable of projecting balls at a rate of 50 rounds per minute. Tests in 1829 failed and the gun was transferred to the arsenal of St. Petersburg. It is now in the Military History Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Communications, St. Petersburg. The Winans Steam Gun of 1858‚Äì1861 was a steam-powered centrifugal gun used during the American Civil War by the Confederates. It used steam power and centrifugal forces to propel projectiles. It was not used successfully in battle. Prototype Holman Projector, an anti-aircraft grenade projector, in action in 1940 A successful World War II steam cannon was the Holman Projector, which was used to launch explosive grenades into the air to create a defensive barrage against low-flying enemy aircraft. These later steam cannons were fired by rapidly introducing a burst of highly pressurized steam into the chamber behind the projectile, accelerating the projectile up the barrel to a high speed, much like an air gun only more powerful. The fundamental function of the device was basically the same as a steam engine, only with a projectile taking place of a piston. The Holman Projector was produced by Holman Brothers of Cornwall, who specialised in pneumatic equipment for mining. The first Projectors were powered by compressed air, stored in high pressure cylinders. After a successful defence of the in August 1940, downing two Heinkel floatplanes, there was a demand for more projectors to be fitted to small naval trawlers. Since these vessels were steam-powered but had no compressed air system, the Admiralty requested Holmans to develop a steam-powered version of the Projector. There were concerns by Treve Holman over the effects of heat on the Mills bomb projectile. A test was arranged, where a borrowed council steam roller was used to 'cook' the Projector and projectile, at 190 ¬∞C for 20 minutes before the projectile was safely fired to 1,000 feet altitude.

Pinocchio was carved by a woodcarver named Geppetto in a Tuscan village. He was created as a wooden puppet but he dreams of becoming a real boy. He is notably characterized for his frequent tendency to lie, which causes his nose to grow. Pinocchio is a cultural icon. He is one of the most re-imagined characters in children's literature. His story has been adapted into many other media, notably the 1940 Disney film Pinocchio. Collodi often used the Italian Tuscan dialect in his book. The name Pinocchio is a combination of the Italian words pino (pine), and occhio (eye); Pino is also an abbreviation of Giuseppino, the diminutive for Giuseppe (the Italian form of Joseph); one of the men who greatly influenced Collodi in his youth was Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist who supervised Collodi at the Libreria Piatti bookshop in Florence. Geppetto, the name of Pinocchio's creator and ‚Äúfather,‚Äù is the diminutive for Geppo, the Tuscan pronunciation of ceppo, meaning a log, stump, block, stock or stub. Fictional character biography Pinocchio, by Carlo Chiostri (1901) Pinocchio's characterization varies across interpretations, but several aspects are consistent across all adaptations: Pinocchio is a puppet, Pinocchio's maker is Geppetto and Pinocchio's nose grows when he lies. Pinocchio is known for having a short nose that becomes longer when he is under stress (chapter 3), especially while lying. In the original tale, Collodi describes him as a \\"rascal,\\" \\"imp,\\" \\"scapegrace,\\" \\"disgrace,\\" \\"ragamuffin,\\" and \\"confirmed rogue,\\" with even his father, carpenter Geppetto, referring to him as a \\"wretched boy.\\" Upon being born, Pinocchio immediately laughs derisively in his creator's face, whereupon he steals the old man's wig. Pinocchio's bad behavior, rather than being charming or endearing, is meant to serve as a warning. Collodi originally intended the story, which was first published in 1881, to be a tragedy. It concluded with the puppet‚Äôs execution. Pinocchio‚Äôs enemies, the Fox and the Cat, bind his arms, pass a noose around his throat, and hang him from the branch of an oak tree. > A tempestuous northerly wind began to blow and roar angrily, and it beat the > poor puppet from side to side, making him swing violently, like the clatter > of a bell ringing for a wedding. And the swinging gave him atrocious > spasms...His breath failed him and he could say no more. He shut his eyes, > opened his mouth, stretched his legs, gave a long shudder, and hung stiff > and insensible. = Characteristics = Clothing and character Pinocchio is a wooden marionette (a puppet that is manipulated with wires) and not a hand puppet (directly controlled from inside by the puppeteer's hand). However, the piece of wood from which he is derived is animated, and so Pinocchio moves independently. Basically good, he often gets carried away by bad company and is prone to lying. His nose will become longer and longer once he starts lying to others. Because of these characteristics, he often finds himself in trouble. Pinocchio undergoes transformations during the novel: he promises The Fairy with Turquoise Hair to become a real boy, flees with Candlewick to the Land of Toys, becomes a donkey, joins a circus, and becomes a puppet again. In the last chapter, out of the mouth of The Terrible Dogfish with Geppetto, Pinocchio finally stops being a puppet and becomes a real boy (thanks to the intervention of the Fairy in a dream). In the novel, Pinocchio is often depicted with a pointy hat, a jacket and a pair of colored, knee-length pants. In the Disney version, the appearance is different; the character is dressed in Tyrolean style, with Lederhosen and a hat with a feather. Nose Pinocchio's nose is his best-known characteristic. It grows in length when he tells a lie; this appears in chapter XVI. Collodi himself, in Note gaie claims how \\"to hide the truth of a speculum animae (mirror of the soul) face [ ... ] is added to the true nose another papier-mache nose.\\" There is an inconsistency, however, because his nose grows when it is first carved by Geppetto, without Pinocchio ever lying. The nose appears only a couple of times in the story, but it reveals the Blue Fairy's power over Pinocchio when he acts disobediently. After the boy's struggling and weeping over his deformed nose, the Blue Fairy summons woodpeckers to peck it back to normal. Literary analysis Some literary analysts have described Pinocchio as an epic hero. Like many Western literary heroes, such as Odysseus, Pinocchio descends into hell; he also experiences rebirth through metamorphosis, a common motif in fantasy literature.Morrissey, Thomas J., and Richard Wunderlich. \\"Death and Rebirth in Pinocchio.\\" Children's Literature 11 (1983): 64‚Äì75. Before writing Pinocchio, Collodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the then-recently unified Italy, including a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, titled Viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino ('Little Johnny's voyage through Italy'). Throughout Pinocchio, Collodi chastises Pinocchio for his lack of moral fiber and his persistent rejection of responsibility and desire for fun. The structure of the story of Pinocchio follows that of the folktales of peasants who venture out into the world but are na√Øvely unprepared for what they find, and get into ridiculous situations. At the time of the writing of the book, this was a serious problem, arising partly from the industrialization of Italy, which led to a growing need for reliable labour in the cities; the problem was exacerbated by similar, more or less simultaneous, demands for labour in the industrialization of other countries. One major effect was the emigration of much of the Italian peasantry to cities and to foreign countries such as the United States. The main imperatives demanded of Pinocchio are to work, be good, and study.

The 576th is stationed at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. Mission The mission of the 576th is to execute Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)'s Force Development Evaluation program for America's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Force and serve as the command's experts for missile systems capability and Air Force application demonstrations. In executing the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Initial Operational Test and Evaluation and Force Development Evaluation programs, the 576th Flight Test Squadron prepares for and conducts ground and flight tests to collect, analyze, and report performance, accuracy, and reliability data for the Joint Staff, United States Strategic Command, Air Staff, and AFGSC. The 576th Flight Test Squadron identifies missile system requirements, demonstrates current and future war fighting capabilities, and validates missile system improvements and upgrades. History =World War II= 576th Bomb Squadron B-24H LiberatorAircraft is Consolidated B-24H-15-CF Liberator, serial 41-29433. The 576th Flight Test Squadron was first activated at Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona, on 26 January 1943 as the 576th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) where it participated in the strategic bombardment campaigns of Europe and Germany as part of Eighth Air Force. Their involvement during the Normandy invasion and the Battle of the Bulge resulted in seven European- African-Middle Eastern Theater campaign streamers and one Distinguished Unit Citation. The 576th was inactivated on 13 September 1945 with the close of World War II. It was reactivated on 24 September 1947 as a very heavy bombardment squadron at Barksdale Field Louisiana, the squadron's mission was changed in November 1947 to a light jet bomber squadron. It was again inactivated in November 1949. =Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Squadron= The squadron was reactivated on 6 March 1958 as the 576th Strategic Missile Squadron at Cooke Air Force Base (later renamed Vandenberg Air Force Base). On 1 April 1958, the 576th was assigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC) as an SM-65 Atlas ICBM unit, the nation's first ICBM unit. The squadron became the first SAC unit to place an ICBM on alert, when it placed one of its Atlas D missiles on alert on 31 October 1959 at Vandenberg.Narducci, p. 3 Initially, the 576th operated launch sites 576 Alpha 1, 2 and 3, which consisted of open support towers with SM-65D Atlas ICBMS standing in the open. The open launch pads remained on nuclear alert until 1 May 1964. In the spring of 1960, began using the \\"coffin\\" type shelters and missile erectors at Vandenberg Baker pads 1,2, and 3 along with 576 Charlie, Foxtrot and Golf that were used as a testing pad for the operational testing of the SM-65E Atlas and site 576 D for Atlas F operational testing. The squadron went off ICBM nuclear alert duties with the inactivation of Alpha 1, 2 and 3, however it continued operational testing of the Atlas ICBM until 1965 when the weapons system was retired and the missiles sent to Norton Air Force Base California for long term storage and use as satellite launch vehicles for NASA. On 2 April 1966, the 576th was once again inactivated. =ICBM Testing Squadron= Redesignated the 576th Test Squadron on 29 August 1991, it was again activated on 1 September 1991 as part of the activation of the Twentieth Air Force, America's only ICBM numbered Air Force. The 576th designation was chosen to ensure the history and lineage of the 576th would continue with the important job of testing ICBMs. The 576th has almost made a complete circle since the 576th Strategic Missile Squadron tested the Atlas missile in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In July 1993, the 576th was assigned to the Fourteenth Air Force at Vandenberg AFB. The squadron was re-designated the 576th Flight Test Squadron (FLTS) on 1 July 1994. Then, on 22 February 1996 the squadron was reassigned from the Fourteenth Air Force to Space Warfare Center (SWC) at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado. On 14 March 1996, the 576th, the 30th Maintenance Squadron and portions of the 30th Logistics Support Squadron merged to form the new 576 FLTS. Whereas the three organizations previously reported, through different commanders, to the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg AFB, this merger aligned all personnel directly involved with Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) testing at Vandenberg under one commander. As part of the merger, the 576 FLTS also became a direct reporting unit to the Space Warfare Center, which later became the Space Innovation & Development Center (SIDC). On 1 December 2009 the 576 FLTS was reassigned, along with the Air Force's ICBM mission, to Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).

It is situated along Governor's Avenue in the state capital, Ikeja. The House of Assembly is currently under the All Progressives Congress which is the current party ruling Lagos State. There have been eight different house of assemblies the very first one was inaugurated 2 October 1979 and the present one was inaugurated 7 June 2019. There are forty members of the House of Assembly, two represent one of the twenty various local government areas in Lagos. Leadership The present Speaker of the House of Assembly is Rt. Hon Mudashiru Obasa (Member representing Agege I) and he is the first to be re- elected into office three consecutive times, and a fifth term record. Functions The purpose of the House of Assembly is to \\"provide information on the scope of responsibilities, services and commitment for the entire people of Lagos State\\". Their vision is to be \\"the leading light and pathfinder for Nigerian legislatures\\", and their mission is to make laws that will ensure good governance, representing the will of Lagosians and in the process ensuring judicious use of the resources of the state in order for Lagosians to receive maximum benefit. File:Lagos State House of Assembly2.jpgLagos State House of Assembly (East View) File:Lagos State House of Assembly.jpgLagos State House of Assembly File:State House, Alausa.jpgLagos State House of Assembly, Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos. The Lagos State House of Assembly was created to provide certain services for the good of Lagosians. Each service has various standards that must be met; for example, whenever the appropriation of a bill is passed on to the house they must ensure that estimates are critically analysed and resources are distributed in such a way those in need are put in priority. They must also ensure that the money budgeted is efficiently utilized judiciously as intended. When it comes to law making, the House of Assembly must ensure the laws are passed with the positive interest of Lagosians at heart. The laws must also be practical and implementable over a long period of time. In the case of legitimizing of a political candidate for office the House of Assembly must pick an individual who is well qualified and possesses the skills needed for the position. Members of the public are allowed to express their opinions of this candidate in the House of Assembly form petitions and all these petitions must be read and put into consideration before appointing the candidate for a public office. When members of the public send in petitions to the House of Assembly regarding various issues, the Committee Secretary of the House of Assembly is given a 48-hour limit to respond to these petitions leaving behind his name, position and contact information. Formal petitions will receive responses within two weeks of the day it was issued. State House, Alausa The House of Assembly recognizes that every Lagosian has the right to peacefully protest, therefore part of the House of Assembly's responsibility is to ensure that the citizens' rights are protected. Furthermore, the House of Assembly is entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the activities of ministries, departments and agencies (MDA's), through committees. These committees conduct semi-annually and annually inspections on the books of MDA's in order to ensure they are complying with the rules and laws that have been put in place; any defiance of the law is punished accordingly. Lastly, another service they provide is publication of hazards, these are word for word reports of the proceedings in the House of Assembly and they are made available to the general public for a fixed fee.

Career Growing up in Maple Valley, Washington, she became interested in professional wrestling during the late 1990s and, seeing a commercial for WWE Tough Enough during Monday Night Raw, auditioned for the reality television series. Originally one of thirteen contestants, she eventually reached the finals with Chris Nowinski, Maven Huffman, Josh Mathews and Nidia Guenard. In November 2001, soon after the finale of the show, Matheny made her professional wrestling debut in New England's World Wrestling Alliance in November 2001. Within a short time, she appeared on the independent wrestling circuit across the United States. During the next year, Matheny appeared in numerous independent promotions. She defeated Frost in an intergender match at Alaska Superslam II in Anchorage on February 17. While competing for New Era Wrestling, she teamed with Rory Fox to defeat Gage Octane and Vixen in a mixed tag team match on April 6. She also faced April Hunter at a Universal Wrestling Federation event in Oxford, Pennsylvania on April 19, 2006; this was one of two matches during which Hunter made her professional debut. After making an appearance in Liberty All-Star Wrestling defeating Danny Rose and Allison Danger in a mixed tag team match on April 20, Matheny began competing for the Nova Scotia-based Mainstream Wrestling. She defeated Kyle Kruze in a series of intergender matches and teamed with Lincoln Steen to defeat Flexx Falcone and Morgan Storm in mixed tag team matches during late April. She defeated Morgan Storm in two subsequent \\"Ladies\\" matches on April 28 and 29, 2002. After wrestling against Allison Danger at Jersey All Pro Wrestling's Memorial Day Massacre supercard on May 26, Matheny accepted an invitation by the Japanese female wrestling promotion ARSION for a three and a half month tour in Japan. During the tour, she teamed with Bionic J and Cheerleader Melissa in a six-woman tag team match to defeat Mariko Yoshida, Kaori Yoneyama and Baby A on June 23. She also faced Baby A and Rie Tamada in singles matches before losing to Ai Fujita in a match for the WWWA Super Lightweight Championship on August 25, 2002. After facing Rena Takase, Mika Nishio and MARU in a six-woman tag team match with Bionic J and Cheerleader Melissa on September 12, Matheny returned to the United States. Inactive during late 2002, she briefly feuded with Cheerleader Melissa in Live Action Wrestling in January 2003. Later that month, she appeared at a LAW event with B.G. James, Disco Inferno, Norman Smiley, Buff Bagwell and The Road Warriors. Although scheduled to debut in the Carolina Wrestling Federation at the BattleCade III supercard on December 28, Matheny canceled her appearance, and by the latter part of 2003, she became tired of the wrestling business and retired. However, on September 2, 2005, she made a surprise appearance with her boyfriend Brian Kendrick at a show for Full Impact Pro. Matheny was, at last word, pursuing a career as a Hollywood make-up artist, working on the 2005 film The Last Will.

Felix was a 1000-pound (454 kg) general purpose (GP) bomb with an infrared seeker in the nose and octagonal guidance fins in the tail. Unlike other weapons, such as the German Fritz X, Felix was autonomous once launched, although there was a flare in the tail for tracking.

Anysia was born to a wealthy and pious Christian family in Salonika. She dedicated herself to vows of chastity and poverty, praying and helping the poor. The legend of her martyrdom states that in 304, a Roman soldier apprehended her as she was on her way to mass. Discovering she was a Christian, he beat her, and intended to drag her to a pagan temple to sacrifice to Roman gods.

Playing career Elkes was born in Snedshill, Oakengates, Shropshire, and played his youth football with Wellington Town before joining Stalybridge Celtic in 1914. =Birmingham= In January 1918 he joined Birmingham, making a few appearances for the club in the wartime leagues and scoring a winning goal which helped the club win their group of the 1919 Football League (Midland Section) subsidiary competition. After the end of the First World War, he made his debut in the Second Division of the Football League on 27 September 1919, scoring two goals in a 4‚Äì2 defeat of Huddersfield Town. In 1919‚Äì20 he was mainly used as cover for the established inside-forwards, but still contributed eight goals in sixteen appearances. The following season injury, the arrival of Scottish international playmaker Johnny Crosbie and the form of former England player Harry Hampton, restricted Elkes to just two appearances as Birmingham took the Second Division title. He took advantage of Crosbie's unavailability at the start of the 1921‚Äì22 season to score six goals in the opening four fixtures. Though he kept his place for a couple of months, the goals dried up; he scored only once in twelve more games, making his last Birmingham appearance on Boxing Day 1921 before being transferred to Southampton in March 1922.Matthews, Birmingham City: A Complete Record. pp. 162‚Äì64. =Southampton= At the time Southampton were leading the Third Division South table and their fans were confident of gaining promotion. Manager Jimmy McIntyre shocked them by announcing a four player transfer, with wingers Fred Foxall and Joe Barratt moving to Birmingham in exchange for Elkes and George Getgood (a half-back). The move was a success, however, as Southampton were able to claim the title by overtaking Plymouth Argyle on the final day of the season. Elkes was again unable to play a significant role in winning the title. He scored two goals on his debut on 4 March 1922 in a 5‚Äì0 victory over Southend United but broke his collar bone the following Saturday (also against Southend) which put him out for the rest of the season. Elkes was described by Holley & Chalk in \\"The Alphabet of the Saints\\" as \\"a tall man, who was a clever player\\". He played 31 games with five goals in the following season as Southampton consolidated their place in Division Two, finishing in mid-table with the unusual record of: Played 42, won 14, drew 14, lost 14, goals for 40, goals against 40, points 42. They also had a run in the FA Cup, where they got through each of the first three rounds after replays (over First Division Newcastle United, Chelsea and Second Division Bury), before going out to West Ham United after a second replay. Elkes appeared in all nine FA Cup matches, scoring Saints' goal in the first match against West Ham. =Tottenham Hotspur= After one full season at The Dell he moved to Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of over ¬£1000. He then spent six seasons at White Hart Lane alongside players such as Jimmy Seed, Frank Osborne and Charlie Handley. During his time at Spurs he made exactly 200 appearances, scoring 50 goals, including a hat-trick in a 5‚Äì0 victory over Blackburn Rovers on 15 November 1924. Elkes also won representative honours while with Spurs. Though four appearances in England trial matches proved unsuccessful, he toured Australia with the Football Association in 1925, played for the Football League XI on three occasions, and represented the Professionals against the Amateurs in the 1925 FA Charity Shield. =Middlesbrough and afterwards= In July 1929 he moved to Middlesbrough where he was switched to centre half, making 113 appearances (with four goals) in four seasons before, at the age of 38, joining Watford for the 1933‚Äì34 season. He then moved back to his native Shropshire, spending one season with Stafford Rangers winding up his career with two years at Oakengates Town in the Birmingham & District League. After his playing career came to an end, he coached the Ford Motor Works team at Dagenham.

The NCAA Eligibility Center manages the daily operations of the NLI program while the Collegiate Commissioners Association (CCA) provides governance oversight of the program. Started in 1964 with seven conferences and eight independent institutions, the program now includes 676 Division I and II participating institutions. There are designated dates for different sports, and these dates are commonly referred to as \\"Signing Days\\". Division III institutions are specifically banned from using the NLI, or any similar document that is not executed by non-athletes at those institutions. NLIs are typically faxed by the recruited student to the university's athletic department on a National Signing Day. The NLI is a voluntary program with regard to both institutions and student-athletes. No prospective student-athlete or parent is required to sign the National Letter of Intent, and no institution is required to join the program.  History  J. William Davis, Professor of Government and Faculty Athletics Representative at Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University), created the National Letter of Intent program in 1964. He was assisted by Howard Grubbs, who was Commissioner of the Southwest Conference at the time. In October 2007, the NCAA became responsible for the administration of the program.History of the National Letter of Intent Program  NLIs and the recruiting process  Blue chip athletes often end recruiting with a hat selection ceremony in which they make an oral commitment, which generally leads to the formal signing of a National Letter of Intent. National Letters of Intent may only be signed by prospective student-athletes who will be entering a four-year institution for the first time in the academic year after they sign the NLI. Recruits who have signed NLIs must attend the schools they have signed with in order to receive financial aid, and NCAA rules forbid coaches from recruiting them further; these restrictions aim to add certainty to the recruiting process for players (who are certain to receive aid) and coaches (who are certain that a recruit will attend their school). By contrast, oral commitments are nonbinding; recruits may change or revoke an oral commitment at any time, and coaches may continue to recruit an orally committed player. The restrictive nature of the NLI is designed to be advantageous to both prospective student-athletes and intercollegiate athletics programs. Intercollegiate athletics departments are not required to provide financial aid in cases where a student-athlete is not admitted for academic reasons. Seth Davis, a columnist for Sports Illustrated, has suggested that this arrangement is actually disadvantageous to student- athletes, as they have no recourse if an athletics department decides not to admit a player for non-academic reasons; for example, an athletics department could replace a signed recruit with another recruit by claiming that the first one was not admitted for academic reasons. Faxing of letters Given the methods of transmitting NLIs that are available under NCAA rules, the letters are typically faxed by students to the university's athletic department. Although NCAA rules allow for use of postal mail, courier, and electronic transmission, nearly all students opt for fax machines, because of the speed of transmission and the ease of verifying signatures sent that way.

The museum records the history of the serial escapee Moondyne Joe and his imprisonment in the \\"native cell\\". History Side of the complex with broken glass embedded into the top of the wall to discourage escape attempts In the early days of settlement (1832) the military and the resident magistrate were stationed at York. Crimes at this time were mostly stealing of livestock. In June 1840, Governor John Hutt created a special police force, known as the Native Police, to deal with native offenders, as distinct from the civil police, which dealt with \\"white\\" settlers. The new force was led by John Drummond, who had become friendly with the Noongar people and, with his Aboriginal troopers, made regular patrols around the district. Samuel Pole Phillips was appointed as the local justice of the peace, to support the work of the resident magistrate. After the murder of Chidlow and Jones by a group of 40 Aboriginals, Govorner Hutt, in 1837, ordered a substantial barracks and stables to be built on the Toodyay townsite on lot R1. This was the first Government building for the town and was built by William Criddle in 1842. By 1854, Toodyay had a Mounted Police Force under Constable Gee, a Native Police Force under Constable James Betts, as well as the Pensioner Guards. A new lockup to serve as a gaol was built on the Toodyay townsite on lot R66 in Charles Street. It consisted of 12 cells, warder's quarters and an exercise yard with a high wall. The main offences among white settlers related to drunkenness, whether the offenders were \\"free\\" or \\"bonded\\". In April 1851, the convict ship Pyrenees arrived, which forced Governor Charles Fitzgerald to establish depots in country areas. For the Toodyay valley, Michael Clarkson became the Superintendent of the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot. At first the convicts were housed at the Toodyay Barracks in the Toodyay townsite. The accompanying Pensioner Guards, ex military, who had been offered land as an incentive to come to the colony, acted as a special police force for emergencies. Those who came to the depot in Toodyay Valley were offered small land grants at the Toodyay townsite. These were worked out on a plan of the town but were later cancelled when the Pensioner Guards were moved to the new depot site, which was two miles further upstream. This is the present site of today's Toodyay, which was formerly called Newcastle. Due to the economic recession the convict hiring depot was no longer needed. In 1860-61 it was decided to abandon the Toodyay townsite due to more floods in those years and the preceding ones, and to move to the centre of the depot site. The Mounted Police moved into the Commissariat Stables. The police sergeant, two constables and the lockup keeper were given cottages. One of the rooms was used for a courtroom. The magistrate suggested a site for the new gaol between the Toodyay townsite and the depot. He made this suggestion on the grounds that drunks could be more easily transported from the local inns to the cells, as the Queens Head was the main inn at the time. James Everett's inn was to suffer the same fate as the buildings in the Toodyay townsite, for a severe flood in 1862 put watermarks on the walls higher than ever before and cracked the walls. Durlacher insisted that the new gaol should have a courtroom. A small lockup at the depot was strengthened with fittings removed from the Toodyay townsite gaol/lockup. A record of this transaction exists, dated 1862. Meanwhile, plans were being drawn up by Richard Roach Jewell for a new gaol. Eventually the site chosen for the 1862 plan was lot 29 in Clinton Street, in the new town of Newcastle. The plan for the Newcastle Gaol was Public Works Plan, PWD No 179. Timber from an old lockup from Bailup was used. Convict labour was used, although the work was supervised by a stonemason (ex convict) who was living in the area. He complained of having unskilled workers working with him and reported that the job was taking longer to do because of this. Jewell's plan showed a timber lined security cell, which also has an iron bar for leg irons. The existing gaol is much smaller than was originally planned. Durlacher did not get his courtroom. The proportions were planned on a square, with more living accommodation than exists at present. The gaol was eventually finished in 1864 and operational by 1865. The gaol continued as a state gaol until 1909. In the 1930s, the building was used as a residence by the Dorizzi family. The sons slept in the cells. The boys joined the Australian army and in 1945, three of the brothers died at the hands of their enemy captors. One cell is now dedicated to them and to all local servicemen and women who did not return home. After World War II for nearly 20 years the building slowly deteriorated until a restoration programme was undertaken in 1962, and the museum began. Current use Old Newcastle Gaol, inside before restoration commenced in 1962 In 1962, the gaol was restored as a museum by the Shire of Toodyay and the W.A. Tourist Bureau. Grants from the National Heritage Commission, matched by grants from the Shire of Toodyay have enabled the fabric of the building to be stabilized. The building is classified under the National Trust. The museum is now a recognised museum under the Museum Act, vested in the Shire of Toodyay. The Shire employs a professional museum curator who manages the gaol with the assistance of volunteers. The displays have constantly improved over the years and now include the Moondyne Joe Gallery and the \\"Native\\" Cell. The latter display contributed to a Heritage Council Award for Interpretation in 2013. The main exhibition space features temporary displays, including from time to time a courtroom scene. Other areas feature artefacts relating to daily life in the settler era. At the rear is a display of early agricultural machinery while across the road is the restored 1891 Police Stable, the 1907 Police Lock-Up and a one-hundred-year-old shearing shed relocated from further afield. A number of horse-drawn appliances and carts can be viewed at this site. In 1983 the museum received an award from the Museums Australia for Best Educational Programme.Plaque on display at the museum Police stables Toodyay Police Stables The stables opposite the gaol site were constructed in 1891 and remained in use until 1955. The present structure replaced a timber building erected on this site in 1860, which were destroyed by fire. The present building is a single storey stone range with brick quoining and stone window dressings. It has a shallow pitched corrugated iron roof with gables. The fa√ßade facing the street is solid stonework with five small high level openings. Restoration of the building began in the 1970s and the stables are currently open as part of the Old Gaol Museum complex.

The community was founded by Saint Louis de Montfort in 1705 with the recruitment of his first missionary disciple, Mathurin Rangeard. The congregation is made up of priests and brothers who serve both in the native lands and in other countries. The Montfortian Family comprises three groups: the Company of Mary, the Daughters of Wisdom and the Brothers of Saint Gabriel.Montfortian Spirituality History As early as 1700 Montfort had conceived the idea of founding a society of missionaries. Five months after his ordination, in November 1700, Montfort wrote: \\"I am continually asking in my prayers for a poor and small company of good priests to preach missions and retreats under the standard and protection of the Blessed Virgin\\".Bemelmans, John. \\"Missionaries of the Company of Mary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 22 January 2016 In 1713 he went to Paris with a view to recruit members for his community. The director of the seminary Du St-Esprit promised to send him such young priests as would feel called to do missionary work. During the intervals between his missions Montfort wrote the Rule of the Company of Mary though no official membership would develop before his death. After de Montfort died in 1716, two young priests and occasional collaborators, Father Adrien Vatel and Father Rene Mulot continued his mission. From 1718-1781 the \\"Mulotins\\", although few in number, gave over 430 missions throughout western France, most of which lasted a month. After the French Revolution Montfort's community was reorganised by Father Gabriel Deshayes, elected superior general in 1821. He received from Pope Leo XII a brief of praise for the Company of Mary and for the Daughters of Wisdom, which had also been formed by de Montfort with the help of Blessed Marie Louise Trichet. Father Dalin who was superior general from 1837-1855, obtained canonical approbation of both congregations. Hitherto the missionaries had but one residence, the mother-house at Saint-Laurent-sur- S√®vre (where de Montfort and Trichet are buried) in the Pays de la Loire region. During Dalin's administration as general, several establishments were made in France. Under his successor, Father Denis (1855-1877) the community accepted the direction of a seminary at Pontch√¢teau in the Diocese of Nantes, from where priests were sent to Haiti, the Company's first attempt at foreign missions. The anti-clerical sentiment which arose in the French government in the late 19th century, resulted in the enacting of the Jules Ferry laws which led to many religious congregations which operated schools to leave France. The Montfortian novices took refuge in the Netherlands, where a novitiate and a scholasticate were established. In 1883, a school was also begun at Schimmert. That same year saw the establishment of the first house in Canada. The beatification of de Montfort, in 1888, gave a new stimulus to the company's expansion. A novitiate and a scholasticate were founded near Ottawa (1890); a mission school at Papineauville, Quebec (1900) and missions in Denmark. In 1901 the Company took charge of what was then the Apostolic vicariate of Nyassa Land (Malawi) where the congregation ministers to this day.1913 Catholic Encyclopedia: Company of Mary The 20th century witnessed the expansion of the Company throughout the world, and its members now serve on every continent. Mission and charism The mission of the Company of Mary is expressed in the Congregation's Constitutions as follows: > \\"Our Mission in the Church consists in revealing the mystery of salvation to > those who do not yet know it, and in helping those who have already heard > the Good News to rediscover and deepen this mystery by a renewed > consciousness of the meaning of their baptismal commitment.\\" \\"The Marian > character of the Company is an essential possession of our Congregation. > Mary is not present in the life of the missionaries in some accidental > fashion: devotion toward her is an integral part of their spiritual life and > apostolate. The 'total consecration' to Jesus through Mary is the most > outstanding mark of the Marian character of our inspiration.\\"Generalate > website: Who we are Vows As members of a religious congregation Montfortians embrace the evangelical counsels, taking the three traditional religious vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Poverty means that all possessions are held in common and that no member may accumulate wealth. Chastity means more than abstaining from sexual activity and its purpose is to make the religious totally available for service; it is also a sign that only God can completely fill the human heart. For a member of a religious congregation, obedience is not slavishly doing what one is told by the superior but being attentive to God‚Äôs will by prayerfully listening to the voice of the person in charge. Ultimately, these vows are lived out within a community and bolstered by a relationship with God. Religious Formation =Enquiry and discernment= As part of this discernment process it is normal for interested parties to spend weekends, or even longer, in a Montfortian community. During this time the members of the Congregation share what it is like to be a priest, religious brother or sister. The young people are also strongly encouraged to attend Mass as often as possible and to regularly spend time in prayer in order to better discern their vocation. =Postulancy= This period which lasts between six months to a year, and postulants live in a community on a full-time basis. This postulancy is devoted to learning more deeply about what it means to follow Christ as a future Montfort. It is normal for the postulant to study French if he has no, or limited, knowledge of the language. =Novitiate= Once the candidate knows the Montfortian way of life, he is admitted into the novitiate preparing himself to take the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. The novitiate year is crucial, for it is then that the novices > ‚Äú...better understand their divine vocation, and indeed one which is proper > to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form > their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and > suitability are tested.‚Äù Code of Canon Law 646 Thus, the novices are given the opportunity for longer periods of prayer and spiritual reading as well as silence in order to reflect on the vocation God is offering and nature of their response. The spiritual development of the novice is of particular focus, especially through spiritual direction. During the novitiate the history and Constitutions of the Congregation are studied in depth. A simple profession is made at the end of the novitiate and the person officially becomes a member of the Congregation for > ‚ÄúBy religious profession, members assume the observance of the three > evangelical counsels by public vow, are consecrated to God through the > ministry of the Church, and are incorporated into the institute with the > rights and duties defined by law.‚ÄùCode of Canon Law 654 As part of the ceremony, the new member is clothed in the Montfortian habit which consists of a fold-over black cassock, cord from which hang a 15 decade set of rosary beads. =Post Novitiate= Post novitiate is where the newly professed religious deepens his commitment as a member of the Montfortians and decides whether or not to make a lifelong commitment to vowed life. For those with a vocation to be a brother suitable training is pursued in his particular field of interest. It is normal for a brother to make his perpetual profession to the Congregation after 3 or 4 years. The Company of Mary asserts that The Brothers in particular enrich the Mission with their talents as builders especially, as agriculturists, secretaries, leaders in catechesis and in liturgy: services that they continue to offer with the help of the computer and the internet.Generalate website: Fathers and Brothers Those called to Holy Orders study for a degree in theology, taking courses in philosophy if they have no experience of that discipline. At the end of this period of formation, which, according to Canon Law, may last between 3 and 6 yearsCode of Canon Law 655 perpetual profession (final vows) is made and ordination to the diaconate follows and then to the presbyterate between six months and a year later. In exceptional circumstances, temporary vows may be extended beyond the 6-year period, but for no more than 3 years.Canon 657.2 Structure As with all religious congregations in the Latin branch of the Catholic Church, the Montfortians are led by a superior general who is assisted by his council. The general calls a general chapter according to the constitutions of the Company and it is this convocation (composed of elected members from around the world) which sets goals, establishes provinces and sets policy. There are provinces, vice-provinces and delegations each of which is led by a provincial (or someone similar) elected by those members who have taken final vows.

The decreased blood flow (perfusion) to the liver is usually due to shock or low blood pressure. However, local causes involving the hepatic artery that supplies oxygen to the liver, such as a blood clot in the hepatic artery, can also cause ischemic hepatitis. Signs and symptoms People who develop ischemic hepatitis may have weakness, fatigue, mental confusion, and low urine production (oliguria). A small percentage of affected people may develop hepatic coma. Yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice) can occur, but is rare and temporary, as is actual loss of function of the liver. Cause Arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation) Ischemic hepatitis can be caused by a number of reasons (that lead to low blood pressure) including: * Abnormal heart rhythm * Heart failure * Infection * Hypovolemic shock (e.g., due to profuse bleeding) * Blood clots (hepatic artery after surgery) Mechanism The mechanism of ischemic hepatitis depends on the etiopathogenetic origin, be it a cardiomyopathy, cardiac tamponade, trauma, or bleeding. Usually ischemic hepatitis reveals itself after a hypotensive event with increased levels of aminotransferases. Because of this, hypotension is thought to be one of the primary insults leading to ischemic hepatitis. Diagnosis Congestive hepatopathy Blood testing usually shows high levels of the liver transaminase enzymes, AST and ALT, which may exceed 10,000 U/L. It has been found that those who suffer from ischemic hepatitis had significant cardiac disease as well. As a measure of precaution, paracetamol levels and a toxicology screening should be completed to evaluate for possible toxin-mediated injury; it is also imperative to be able to exclude the possibility of acute viral hepatitis. =Related conditions= Ischemic hepatitis is related to another condition called congestive hepatopathy. Congestive hepatopathy includes a number of liver disorders that occur in right-sided heart failure. The medical term congestive hepatopathy is used, however, the term cardiac cirrhosis is convention. These two entities can coexist in an affected individual.

The word was first recorded in the English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation, such as a statue or a painting, especially of a god. By the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image without the substance or qualities of the original.\\"simulacrum\\" The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 1993 Literary critic Fredric Jameson offers photorealism as an example of artistic simulacrum, where a painting is created by copying a photograph that is itself a copy of the real.Massumi, Brian. \\"Realer than Real: The Simulacrum According to Deleuze and Guattari.\\" retrieved 2 May 2007 Other art forms that play with simulacra include trompe-l'≈ìil,Baudrillard, Jean.

Philosophy Simulacra have long been of interest to philosophers. In his Sophist, Plato speaks of two kinds of image- making. The first is a faithful reproduction, attempted to copy precisely the original. The second is intentionally distorted in order to make the copy appear correct to viewers. He gives the example of Greek statuary, which was crafted larger on the top than on the bottom so that viewers on the ground would see it correctly. If they could view it in scale, they would realize it was malformed. This example from the visual arts serves as a metaphor for the philosophical arts and the tendency of some philosophers to distort the truth so that it appears accurate unless viewed from the proper angle. Nietzsche addresses the concept of simulacrum (but does not use the term) in the Twilight of the Idols, suggesting that most philosophers, by ignoring the reliable input of their senses and resorting to the constructs of language and reason, arrive at a distorted copy of reality. Postmodernist French social theorist Jean Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the hyperreal. According to Baudrillard, what the simulacrum copies either had no original or no longer has an original, since a simulacrum signifies something it is not, and therefore leaves the original unable to be located. Where Plato saw two types of representation‚Äîfaithful and intentionally distorted (simulacrum)‚ÄîBaudrillard sees four: (1) basic reflection of reality; (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretence of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which \\"bears no relation to any reality whatsoever\\".Baudrillard Simulacra retrieved 2 May 2007. In Baudrillard's concept, like Nietzsche's, simulacra are perceived as negative, but another modern philosopher who addressed the topic, Gilles Deleuze, takes a different view, seeing simulacra as the avenue by which an accepted ideal or \\"privileged position\\" could be \\"challenged and overturned\\". Deleuze defines simulacra as \\"those systems in which different relates to different by means of difference itself. What is essential is that we find in these systems no prior identity, no internal resemblance\\".p. 299. Alain Badiou, in speaking with reference to Nazism about Evil, writes, \\"fidelity to a simulacrum, unlike fidelity to an event, regulates its break with the situation not by the universality of the void, but by the closed particularity of an abstract set ... (the 'Germans' or the 'Aryans')\\". Recreation Recreational simulacra include reenactments of historical events or replicas of landmarks, such as Colonial Williamsburg and the Eiffel Tower, and constructions of fictional or cultural ideas, such as Fantasyland at The Walt Disney Company's Magic Kingdom. The various Disney parks have by some philosophers been regarded as the ultimate recreational simulacra, with Baudrillard noting that Walt Disney World Resort is a copy of a copy, \\"a simulacrum to the second power\\".Baudrillard, Jean. transl. Francois Debrix. Liberation. 4 March 1996. \\"Disneyworld Company.\\" retrieved 5 May 2010. In 1975, Italian author Umberto Eco argued that at Disney's parks, \\"we not only enjoy a perfect imitation, we also enjoy the conviction that imitation has reached its apex and afterwards reality will always be inferior to it\\".Eco, Umberto. Travels in Hyperreality. Reproduced in relevant portion at \\"The City of Robots\\" retrieved 2 May 2007 This is for some an ongoing concern. Examining the impact of Disney's simulacrum of national parks, Disney's Wilderness Lodge, environmentalist Jennifer Cypher and anthropologist Eric Higgs expressed worry that \\"the boundary between artificiality and reality will become so thin that the artificial will become the centre of moral value\\".Cypher, Jennifer and Eric Higgs. \\"Colonizing the Imagination: Disney's Wilderness Lodge\\". retrieved 2 May 2007 Eco also refers to commentary on watching sports as sports to the power of three, or sports cubed. First, there are the players who participate in the sport (the real), then the onlookers merely witnessing it, and finally the commentary on the act of witnessing the sport. Visual artist Paul McCarthy has created entire installations based on Pirates of the Caribbean and theme park simulacra, with videos playing inside the installation. Caricature An interesting example of simulacrum is caricature. When an artist produces a line drawing that closely approximates the facial features of a real person, the subject of the sketch cannot be easily identified by a random observer; it can be taken for a likeness of any individual. However, a caricaturist exaggerates prominent facial features, and a viewer will pick up on these features and be able to identify the subject, even though the caricature bears far less actual resemblance to the subject. Iconography Beer (1999: p. 11) employs the term \\"simulacrum\\" to denote the formation of a sign or iconographic image, whether iconic or aniconic, in the landscape or greater field of Thangka art and Tantric Buddhist iconography. For example, an iconographic representation of a cloud formation sheltering a deity in a thanka or covering the auspice of a sacred mountain in the natural environment may be discerned as a simulacrum of an \\"auspicious canopy\\" (Sanskrit: Chhatra) of the Ashtamangala. Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena approach a cultural universal and may be proffered as evidence of the natural creative spiritual engagement of the experienced environment endemic to the human psychology. Word usage The Latinised plural simulacra is interchangeable with the anglicised version simulacrums. Simulacrum as artificial beings Simulacra often appear in speculative fiction. Examples of simulacra in the sense of artificial or supernaturally or scientifically created artificial life forms include: * Automaton ‚Äì A self- operating robot. * Artificial animals and replicants in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K Dick and its film adaptation Blade Runner. * Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio ‚Äì A puppet that comes to life. * Feathertop ‚Äì A scarecrow created and brought to life by a witch. * Frankenstein's Monster from Frankenstein ‚Äì A creation of Victor Frankenstein made from various body parts.

Also known as \\"Artificial Humans,\\" the Nomu are deceased humans whose bodies were altered and modified by Dr. Kyudai Garaki to hold more than one Quirk. These mindless creations are used by the League of Villains and later its extended counterpart the Paranormal Liberation Front. * Pintosmalto ‚Äì A statue of a man-made from large amounts of sugar and sweet almonds, scented water, musk and amber, various jewels, gold thread, and above all a trough and a silver trowel who was brought to life by a Goddess of Love. * Revenant - A robot with the mind of a former human hitman in the Apex Legends universe. * Robots * Simulacrum Soldier - Robotic soldiers with human minds employed by both the IMC and Frontier Militia in the Titanfall universe. While they bear a superficial resemblance to the commonly-fielded BRD-01 Spectre, Simulacra are instead human minds uploaded into robotic bodies. A simulacrum can be considered a form of transhumanism. * Simulacrum Spell - An illusion spell from Dungeons & Dragons that creates a partially real duplicate of someone, though it only has half the power and abilities of the original. * Snegurochka ‚Äì A little girl made of snow. * Squadron Supreme of America - In Marvel Comics, the Squadron Supreme of America are revealed to be simulacrums created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite so that Phil Coulson can have them be a United States-sponsored superhero team. * Terracotta Army ‚Äì Terracotta sculptures of the armies of Qin Shi Huang. * The Gingerbread Man ‚Äì A gingerbread man that came to life. * The Golem of Jewish folklore ‚Äì A creation of a rabbi. * Thumbelina ‚Äì A small girl created by a witch. * Ushabiti ‚Äì Egyptian figurines. * Vasilisa the Beautiful ‚Äì A doll that came to life.

History In 1707, when he was temporary chaplain of the hospital of Poitiers, Louis de Montfort assembled some pious young women into a small community, and gave them a rule to live by. Its main points have been retained in the Rule of the Daughters of Wisdom. The congregation strives to acquire heavenly wisdom by imitating the Incarnate Wisdom, Jesus Christ.Bemelmans, John. \\"Daughters of Wisdom.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 16 Sept. 2014 When St Louis died in 1716, the community numbered only four sisters, led by Blessed Marie Louise Trichet who had met Louis de Montfort in 1701 and became known as the \\"First Daughter of Wisdom\\" when she offered her services to the hospital. Her mother is said to have told her: \\"You will become as mad as that priest\\". There followed a forty-three year career during which she nursed the sick, gave food to beggars and administered the great maritime hospital of France. The poor people of the Hospital of Niort (Deux-S√®vres) called her \\"good Mother Jesus\\". In 1714, she was joined by Catherine Brunet.\\"Life of Blessed Marie-Louise Trichet\\", Company of Mary, Vice-Province of Great Britain and Ireland In 1715, at the request of the Bishop of La Rochelle, the sisters moved to that city. Henceforth the congregation undertook both care of the sick and teaching. Sister Marie-Louise was superior of the congregation. On 22 August 1715, Montfort gave the habit of Wisdom to Sister Ste Croix and Sister Incarnation. In 1720 the site of their mother-house was acquired at Saint-Laurent-sur-S√®vre. Henceforth the life of Marie-Louise was to be a series of travels necessitated by new foundations and by visits to all her communities; in 1750 there were already thirty. She died on 27 April 1759. By the time of the French Revolution, the sisters numbered 700. During the Revolutionary era, they were severely persecuted and imprisoned. Two sisters were guillotined at Nantes; and another two, Sisters V√©ronique and Jouin, at Rennes. Under Napoleon, the community regained most of their former houses and were granted 30,000 francs for building purposes. It was in 1810, when Napoleon was temporarily the master of Europe, that, at his call, the Daughters of Wisdom left French soil for the first time to nurse wounded soldiers at Antwerp. Numerous medals were bestowed on the congregation by Napoleon, and by every French Government since; Spain, Prussia, and Belgium have honoured them for nursing the wounded or plague- stricken soldiers of those countries; as a congregation they have been acknowledged in the Apostolic Brief of Pope Leo XII in 1825; they were canonically approved, together with the Fathers of the Company of Mary, in 1853; they were placed under Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli as protector, and favoured by two important decrees in 1893 and 1898 securing the integrity of Montfort's institution; and they received the definitive approbation of the constitutions of Montfort's double foundation in 1904. Since then the Daughters of Wisdom has grown to a multinational organisation with houses across the world.

At the end of the war he was playing for Blackheath Town at Coventry when he was spotted by Jimmy McIntyre, then Southampton's trainer, who invited him for a trial at The Dell. He was signed by the \\"Saints\\" in time for the first post-war season in the Southern League, where he was joined by his Blackheath teammate, Reg Hackett. Foxall immediately made the outside-left position his own and was an excellent winger. According to Holley & Chalk \\"his well placed centres from varying angles were a strong feature of his repertoire\\" In 1920 Southampton, along with most Southern League clubs, joined the new Football League Third Division and Foxall was ever-present as Saints finished their inaugural season in the Football League second in the table, missing out on the only available promotion place. At the end of the season, he provoked controversy when he signed a contract with Aston Villa, although he was still registered with Southampton. He was ordered by the Football Association to re-join Southampton and he continued to give good service until he was transferred to Birmingham in March 1922. At the time Southampton were leading the Third Division South table and their fans were confident of gaining promotion. Manager Jimmy McIntyre shocked them by announcing a four player transfer, with wingers Foxall and Joe Barratt moving to Birmingham in exchange for Jack Elkes (a forward) and George Getgood (a half-back). In his three years at The Dell Foxall made 114 appearances in all competitions, scoring 12 goals. Foxall missed only one First Division game for Birmingham in what remained of 1921‚Äì22, but illness and injury restricted his first full season with the club to 17 appearances, and he joined Watford in June 1923. After 35 appearances for Watford he broke a leg, forcing him to retire completely.

If the bearer were killed, someone finding the card would notify the magazine who would in turn notify the next of kin of the hapless adventurer. The popularity of the card amongst travelers led to the formation of the Adventurers Club of New York. The original New York Adventurers Club led to similar clubs in Chicago (1913), Los Angeles (1921), Copenhagen (1937) and Honolulu (1955).

Hoffman encouraged the details of his writers' fiction to be as factually accurate as possible-mistakes would frequently be pointed out and criticised by the magazine's readers.Sampson, 1991 (p. 27-8) In addition, Adventure under Hoffman also showcased the work of several famous artists, including Rockwell Kent, John R.

By 1924, Adventure was regarded, in the words of Richard Bleiler, as \\" without question the most important \\"pulp\\" magazine in the world.\\" In 1926, the Butterick company decided to print Adventure on slick paper instead of wood-pulp paper. They also changed the magazine's covers to a text listing of contents. Both of these decisions were done in the hope of winning over readers of the \\"slick\\" magazines, such as The Atlantic and Harper's Magazine. However, the magazine's style of fiction did not change, and the new Adventure failed to win over \\"slick\\" magazine readers, instead suffering a twenty per cent fall in circulation. Hoffman, unhappy with the change of format, left the magazine in 1927. Later years After Hoffman's departure, his successors usually followed the template for the magazine that he had set down. In 1934, Adventure was bought by Popular Publications. Throughout the 1930s, Adventure included fiction by Erle Stanley Gardner, Donald Barr Chidsey, Raymond S.

Baumhofer, Hubert Rogers, Rafael De Soto, Lawrence Sterne Stevens and Norman Saunders. The magazine's main editor in the 1940s was Kenneth S. White, the son of the magazine's first editor Trumbull White. In April 1953, the pulp changed its format to that of a men's adventure magazine that lasted until the magazine folded in 1971. This final incarnation of Adventure tends not to be highly regarded among magazine historians, with Robert Weinberg referring to it as \\"a rather mundane slick magazine\\"Weinberg, Robert. \\"Introduction\\" to Swords from the West by Harold Lamb.Bison Books, 2009. (p. xiii). and Richard Bleiler stating that by 1960 Adventure had become '...a dying embarrassment, printing grainy black and white photos of semi-nude women\\". Nevertheless, this version of Adventure did sometimes publish fiction by noted authors, including Arthur C. Clarke (\\"Armaments Race\\", in the April 1954 issue) and Norman Mailer (\\"The Paper House\\" in the December 1958 issue). The final four issues restored the fiction emhpasis in a digest format, but that incarnaton also folded. Anthologies General anthologies from Adventure: * Adventure‚Äôs Best Stories : 1926.

The close, personal relationship between President Agostinho Neto and Cuban leader Fidel Castro complicated the Soviet Union's involvement in the Angolan Civil War and foiled several assassination attempts against Neto. Angolan Civil War As the Portuguese presence in provincial Angola dwindled, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), supported by the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc, fought against the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), an organization based in the Bakongo region of the north and allied with the United States, the People's Republic of China and the Mobutu government in Za√Øre. The United States, South Africa, and several other African nations also supported Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), whose ethnic and regional base lies in the Ovimbundu heartland of central Angola. 1970s The government of the Soviet Union, well aware of The SADFs activity in southern Angola, one week before November 11, 1975, the date on which Angolan nationalists had agreed to declare independence. While Cuban officers led the mission and provided the bulk of the troop force,The Soviet leadership expressly forbid the Cubans from intervening in Angola's civil war, focusing the mission on containing South Africa. Cuba had a close eye on the development. Neto had asked the Soviet Union for support but the Russians did not have in mind to intervene before the elections. In contrast, Cuba was ready to help, as explained by Fidel Castro: \\"When the invasion of Angola by regular SADF troops started 23 October, we could not sit idle. And when the MPLA asked us for help, be offered the necessary aid to prevent Apartheid from making itself comfortable in Angola.\\"Une Odyssee Africaine\\" (France, 2006, 59mn) directed by: Jihan El Tahri The deployment of these troops had not been arranged with the USSR, as often reported and depicted by the U.S. administration. On the contrary, this took the USSR by surprise.N. Broutens, Soviet Politb√ºro, dept. chief foreign affairs, in ‚ÄúUne Odyssee Africaine‚Äù (France, 2006, 59mn) directed by: Jihan El Tahri The Russians had to go along as under no circumstances did they want to endanger relations with their most important outpost in close proximity to the US, but tried to keep a lid on the extent of the Cuban giant military presence in Angola . It was only after two months that Moscow agreed to arrange for a maximum of 10 transport flights from Cuba to Angola. Of course the US assumed that the USSR was behind the Cuban interference. Only years later it became clear to them, that the Cubans acted on their own behalf as admitted by Ronald Regan that ‚Äú The excessive illegal Cuban military operations in Angola was a Fidel Castro project that Moscow was hesitant to support ‚Äú .Frank Wisner Jr., Ambassador, US-Foreign Ministry, in \\"Une Odyssee Africaine\\" (France, 2006, 59mn) directed by: Jihan El Tahri Due to the hostility between the US and Cuba, the Americans regarded such an air by the Cubans could not be accepted.Hermann Cohen, National Security Council, USA, in \\"Une Odyssee Africaine\\" (France, 2006, 59mn) directed by: Jihan El Tahri Shaba invasions Shaba Province, Zaire. 1,500 members of the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC) invaded Shaba, Zaire from eastern Angola on March 7, 1977. The FNLC wanted to overthrow Mobutu and the Angolan government, suffering from Mobutu's support for the FNLA and UNITA, did not try to stop the invasion. The FNLC failed to capture Kolwezi, Zaire's economic heartland, but took Kasaji, and Mutshatsha. Zairian troops were defeated without difficulty and the FNLC continued to advance. Mobutu appealed to William Eteki of Cameroon, Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, for assistance on April 2. Eight days later, the French government responded to Mobutu's plea and airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops into Kinshasa. This troop force worked in conjunction with the Zairian army and the FNLA of Angola with air cover from Egyptian pilots flying French Mirage fighter aircraft to beat back the FNLC. The counter-invasion force pushed the last of the militants, along with a number of refugees, into Angola and Zambia in April. Mobutu accused the Angolan, Cuban and Soviet governments of complicity in the war. While Neto did support the FNLC, the Angolan government's support came in response to Mobutu's continued support for Angola's anti-Communists. John Stockwell, the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Angola, resigned after the invasion, explaining in an article for The Washington Post article Why I'm Leaving the CIA, published on April 10, 1977, that he had warned Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that continued American support for anti-government rebels in Angola could provoke a war with Zaire. He also said covert Soviet involvement in Angola came after, and in response to, U.S. involvement. Nitista revolt Neto's Interior Minister, Nito Alves, had successfully put down Daniel Chipenda's Eastern Revolt and the Active Revolt during Angola's War of Independence. Factionalism within the MPLA became a major challenge to Neto's power by late 1975 and he gave Alves the task of once again clamping down on dissension. Alves shut down the Cabral and Henda Committees while expanding his influence within the MPLA through his control of the nation's newspapers and state-run television. Alves visited the Soviet Union in October 1976. When he returned, Neto began taking steps to neutralize the threat he saw in the Nitistas, followers of Alves. Ten armored cars with the FAPLA's 8th Brigade broke into S√£o Paulo prison at 4 a.m. on May 27, killing the prison warden and freeing more than 150 supporters, including 11 who had been arrested only a few days before.George (2005). Pages 129-131. The government arrested tens of thousands of suspected Nitistas from May to November and tried them in secret courts overseen by Defense Minister Iko Carreira. Those who were found guilty, including Van-Dunem, Jacobo \\"Immortal Monster\\" Caetano, the head of the 8th Brigade, and political commissar Eduardo Evaristo, were then shot and buried in secret graves. The coup attempt had a lasting effect on Angola's foreign relations. Alves had opposed Neto's foreign policy of non-alignment, evolutionary socialism, and multiracialism, favoring stronger relations with the Soviet Union, which he wanted to grant military bases in Angola. While Cuban soldiers actively helped Neto put down the coup, Alves and Neto both believed the Soviet Union supported Neto's ouster. Ra√∫l Castro sent an additional four thousand troops to prevent further dissension within the MPLA's ranks and met with Neto in August in a display of solidarity. In contrast, Neto's distrust in the Soviet leadership increased and relations with the USSR worsened. In December, the MPLA held is first party Congress and changed its name to the MPLA-PT. The Nitista coup took a toll on the MPLA's membership. In 1975, the MPLA boasted of 200,000 members. After the first party congress, that number decreased to 30,000. Operation IA Feature Two days prior to the U.S. government's approval of Operation IA Feature, Nathaniel Davis, the Assistant Secretary of State, told Henry Kissinger, the United States Secretary of State, that he believed maintaining the secrecy of IA Feature would be impossible. Davis correctly predicted the Soviet Union would respond by increasing involvement in the Angolan conflict, leading to more violence and negative publicity for the United States. When Ford approved the program, Davis resigned. Vietnam The Vietnam War tempered foreign involvement in Angola's civil war as neither the Soviet Union nor the United States wanted to be drawn into an internal conflict of highly debatable importance in terms of winning the Cold War. CBS Newscaster Walter Cronkite spread this message in his broadcasts to \\"try to play our small part in preventing that mistake this time.\\" The Politburo engaged in heated debate over the extent to which the Soviet Union would support a continued offensive by the MPLA in February 1976. Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Premier Alexei Kosygin led a faction favoring less support for the MPLA and greater emphasis on preserving d√©tente with the West. Leonid Brezhnev, the then head of the Soviet Union, won out against the dissident faction and the Soviet alliance with the MPLA continued even as Neto publicly reaffirmed its policy of non-alignment at the 15th anniversary of the First Revolt. Rise of dos Santos The Soviets, trying to increase their influence in Luanda, began sending busts of Vladimir Lenin, a plane full of brochures with Brezhnev's speech at the February 1976 Party Congress, and two planes full of pamphlets denouncing Mao Zedong, to Angola. They sent so many busts that they ran out in the summer of 1976 and requested more from the CPSU Propaganda Department. Despite the best efforts of the Soviet propaganda machine and persistent lobbying by G. A. Zverev, the Soviet charg√© d'affaires, Neto stood his ground, refusing to grant the permanent military bases the Soviets so desperately wanted in Angola. Neto allies like Defense Minister Iko Carreira and MPLA General Secretary L√∫cio Lara also irked the Soviet leadership through both for their policies and personalities. With Alves out of the picture, the Soviet Union promoted Prime Minister Lopo do Nascimento, another 'internationalist', against Neto, a 'careerist,' for the MPLA's leadership. Neto moved swiftly to crush his adversary. The MPLA-PT's Central Committee met from December 6 to 9. The Committee concluded the meeting by firing Nascimento as both Prime Minister and as Secretary of the Politburo, the Director of National Television, and the Director of Jornal de Angola. Commander C. R. Dilolua resigned as Second Deputy Prime Minister and a member of the Politburo. Later that month the Committee abolished the positions of Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Paving the way for dos Santos, Neto increased the ethnic composition of the MPLA-PT's political bureau as he replaced the hardline Old Guard with new blood. 1980s SWAPO's and South Africa's operations (1978-1980) In the 1980s, fighting spread outward from southeastern Angola, where most of the fighting had taken place in the 1970s, as the National Congolese Army (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) increased their activity. The South African government responded by sending troops back into Angola, intervening in the war from 1981 to 1987, prompting the Soviet Union to deliver massive amounts of military aid from 1981 to 1986. In 1981, newly elected United States President Ronald Reagan's U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Chester Crocker, developed a linkage policy, tying Namibian independence to Cuban withdrawal and peace in Angola. Democratic International On June 2, 1985, American conservative activists held the Democratic International, a symbolic meeting of anti-Communist militants, at UNITA's headquarters in Jamba, Angola. Primarily funded by Rite Aid founder Lewis Lehrman and organized by anti-Communist activists Jack Abramoff and Jack Wheeler, participants included Savimbi, Adolfo Calero, leader of the Nicaraguan Contras, Pa Kao Her, Hmong Laotian rebel leader, U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, South African security forces, Abdurrahim Wardak, Afghan Mujahideen leader, Jack Wheeler, American conservative policy advocate, and many others. While the Reagan administration, though unwilling to publicly support the meeting, privately expressed approval. The governments of Israel and South Africa supported the idea, but both respective countries were deemed inadvisable for hosting the conference. The participants released a communiqu√© stating, :\\"We, free peoples fighting for our national independence and human rights, assembled at Jamba, declare our solidarity with all freedom movements in the world and state our commitment to cooperate to liberate our nations from the Soviet Imperialists.\\" 1990s The National Assembly passed law 12/91 in May 1991, coinciding with the withdrawal of the last Cuban troops, defining Angola as a \\"democratic state based on the rule of law\\" with a multi-party system. Observers met such changes with skepticism. American journalist Karl Maier wrote, \\"In the New Angola ideology is being replaced by the bottom line, as security and selling expertise in weaponry have become a very profitable business. With its wealth in oil and diamonds, Angola is like a big swollen carcass and the vultures are swirling overhead. Savimbi's former allies are switching sides, lured by the aroma of hard currency.\\" References Category:Bilateral relations of the Soviet Union Soviet Union ","title":"Angola‚ÄìSoviet Union relations"},{"id":"14967035","text":"Flawlessly (1988‚Äì2002) was an American Thoroughbred race horse bred by Harbor View Farm.

Her personal saga and her legal case are the subject of an award-winning documentary Crime After Crime by filmmaker Yoav Potash. The film premiered in January 2011 at the Sundance Film Festival and has since won over 25 awards. Beginning in the mid to late 1970s, Peagler was beaten and forced into prostitution by Oliver Wilson. In 1982, Peagler‚Äôs abuser was beaten and strangled to death by two Crips gang members who were friends of Peagler‚Äôs mother. Peagler was accused of first-degree murder alongside one of the gang members; the other gang member was a minor at the time and was charged with a lesser crime. Peagler never had a trial by jury. Prosecutors threatened to pursue the death penalty against her, and her attorney urged her to plead guilty in order to save her life. She was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. In 2002, lawyers Nadia Costa and Joshua Safran from the law firm Bingham McCutchen learned of Peagler's case from The Habeas Project and began working pro bono to free Peagler. Their work relied on a unique California law enacted in 2002. The law gives battered women in prison the chance for a new hearing if the original court never considered evidence relating to abuse. Her case became controversial in 2005. Peagler's supporters established a website to publicize her cause.Supporter's web site In 2008, a California Superior Court Judge removed Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley's entire office from Peagler's case due to allegations of misconduct and conflicts of interest. The California Court of Appeal later reversed that decision, but also found that some of the allegations against the District Attorney's Office were true. Peagler‚Äôs attorneys in 2007 filed suit against the Los Angeles District Attorney over what they alleged was the broken agreement to free their client. Peagler was incarcerated first at the California Institute for Women, and was later transferred to the Central California Women‚Äôs Facility in Chowchilla, California, the largest women‚Äôs prison in the country. She directed the prison gospel choir and earned two associate degrees while behind bars. In February 2009, Peagler was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and her lawyers attempted to win her release on bail, but the judge declined the request on technical grounds. On July 10, 2009, she was found suitable for release by the California Board of Parole Hearings. On August 4, 2009, Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley questioned the parole decision in a letter to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in which Cooley suggested that the parole board was wrong to offer Peagler her freedom. On August 19, 2009, Peagler's family members and community supporters protested outside the Los Angeles office of California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, demanding Peagler's release. On August 20, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger declined to review the parole finding, allowing Peagler to be released on August 22, 2009.

M. Panton) (April 9, 1870 ‚Äì May 20, 1955) was the pastor of Surrey Chapel, Norwich, Norfolk, UK, where he succeeded Robert Govett. He was the editor (1924‚Äì55) of The Dawn Magazine, a writer of books and numerous tracts, and a British leader among those pursuing Prophetic studies. Early days Panton was born in Jamaica in 1870. There, his father was the first Archdeacon and a missionary of the Church of England. His uncle had been the Archbishop of the West Indies. Panton came to England in 1885 and was educated at the Old Hall School, Wellington, for two years, then at St. Lawrence's School, Ramsgate, where he spent another two years. Finally he attended university at Caius College, Cambridge, where he studied law with a view to becoming a barrister. In his college days, Panton was influenced by one of his tutors, Labarestier, who came from Jersey. It was from him Panton first heard of the doctrines of the coming Kingdom and the Glory of Christ, during the last thousand years of earth's existence (The Millennium). Panton, also, came to accept the view there were conditions, which disciples had to fulfil in order to share this special reign (\\"Selective Rapture\\"). The immediate consequence was Panton's acceptance of baptism by total immersion, which caused him to leave the Church of England and become an \\"Undenominational\\" Christian. Panton remained unaffiliated for most of his life, though later he did bring his Church into membership of the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches. Pastor of Surrey Chapel, Norwich In 1901, Panton was called to take up the pastoral duties at Surrey Chapel, Norwich, succeeding Robert Govett, who had died in February that year and whose teaching he had come to accept from his days at Cambridge. Panton had become acquainted with the Church through doing seven months duties as an assistant to Govett in the 1890s. Panton came to have a close bond with his congregation, in the same way his predecessor had. Panton had a gracious and dignified personality, but also sought to bring all matters of doctrine to the plain exposition of Scripture. Like his predecessor he took a \\"literalistic\\" view of Scripture ‚Äì particularly in eschatology. During his 24 years of \\"full- time\\" ministry at Surrey Chapel, Norwich, he saw the congregation built up. The Church maintained its Evangelical convictions and Panton saw many conversions, which were followed by baptism and Church membership. In particular Panton's time saw the Sunday School built up to reach a peak of over 600 scholars and 60 teachers and officers. There were also several who volunteered for missionary service, including one worker in China (Margaret E. Barber) who was influential in the nurturing of Watchman Nee. Work as editor Panton founded and edited a new bi-monthly magazine, The Dawn, an Evangelical Magazine, which first appeared on 15 April 1924. His aim for his magazine was the stimulus, encouragement, and instruction of Christians who believed without reservation in all the Scriptures, and who sought to devote their lives to the highest ends before the return of Christ and the Kingdom. His editorial policy was to keep The Dawn as a fundamental, evangelistic, missionary, prophetic, dispensational, devotional magazine. This new responsibility heavily taxed the delicate constitution of Panton's health and brought inevitable changes, he retired from full-time ministry at Surrey Chapel, but he agreed to preach for one Sunday in each month. He continued to live within reach of the Church and so was always accessible. He maintained his output of writing the magazine's main article, which was often recycled as a separate tract. Quite often, the monthly sermon was taken down in shorthand by a member of his congregation, and appeared as one of the articles in a later edition of the monthly magazine. His last years From 1941, Panton resigned completely from Surrey Chapel, Norwich. As he aged, he felt the mode of the country and the times changed, so there was a reduction in readers of The Dawn. Paternoster took over from Charles Thynne as the publishers for the magazine. Panton died on 20 May 1955; he had prepared the final issue of his magazine, which ceased after his death. Publications The volumes of The Dawn Magazine from 1924 to 1955 contain at least a leading article by Panton ‚Äì and often more. As well as his own books, tracts and articles, Panton used his magazine to continue to popularise the writings of Robert Govett. Panton's own writings included: *The Christian Home: Its Sanctity and Joy. Charles J. Thynne & Jarvis Ltd, London, May 1924. *Satanic Counterfeits of the Second Advent. Charles J.

The $2.2 billion (2009 dollars) project is designed to improve freight and commuter mobility through the Spokane Metropolitan Area. , only the northern half from Francis Avenue to U.S. Route 395 is open to traffic; the southern half received state funding in 2015 and is anticipated to be completed by 2029. The project is being managed by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and will ultimately create a freeway with a speed limit of along a new alignment linking Interstate 90 (I-90), to the existing US Route 395 (US 395) to the north in the Wandermere area. When completed, the multi-modal facility is expected to have general travel lanes, with right-of- way reserved for a future high-capacity transit system with park-and-ride lots. Additionally, a pedestrian and bicycle trail will run along the entire highway alignment. The project is ranked 19 of 43 on the Congressional High Priority Corridor list of the National Highway System. When completed, the corridor is expected to carry over 150,000 vehicles per day.What are the benefits?, http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/6ABA0621-33AF-4350-B3C6-D0BFF4C5D21D/0/Benefits.pdf Route description The North Spokane Corridor is part of Washington's state highway system and, upon completion, will fully adopt the US 395 designation. Currently, the WSDOT considers the corridor a spur of US 395 and refers to the roadway as \\"Future US 395\\" on its official state highway maps and roadway guide signs. Looking southbound on US 395 from where the North Spokane Corridor splits from Division Street The ultimate route of the highway runs from I-90, just east of Downtown Spokane, northward about meeting the existing US 395 at Wandermere, just north of Spokane. The northern end of the corridor was constructed as a seamless connection to the existing US 395, rerouting the existing highway onto the North Spokane Corridor. The construction of this interchange replaced the existing alignment of US 395 that flowed directly onto Division Street, with an exit to Division off of the freeway. Because the corridor's northern end ties in with a portion of US 395 that was redeveloped into a limited-access highway in the late 1990s (with the construction of a new bridge over Little Spokane River, a full interchange at Hatch Road, and the creation of median-separated lanes extending 3.3 miles beyond Hatch), the completion of the corridor will create a fully controlled-access highway from the vicinity of Hatch Road to I-90. The North Spokane Corridor is planned to bypass the busy Division Street corridor. The new freeway will carry the US 395 designation, and run about one mile (1.6 km) east of where it was originally planned in the 1960s and 1970s. While the new freeway would also be a good routing for US 2 to bypass Spokane, that highway is scheduled to stay on its current routing in order to keep most of Division Street in the state highway system. Nevertheless, it will be easy for motorists on US 2 to avoid this by using the freeway instead of Division Street. On the north side, a full interchange has been constructed at US 2 in the Mead area near Farwell Road. This route uses the entire North Spokane Corridor except the northernmost one mile (1.6 km) section between US 2 and Wandermere. Division street between the \\"Y\\" (historical US 395 and US 2 split) and Wandermere will no longer be in the state highway system. This includes about one-half mile of the new section of Division Street just north of Farwell Road. US 2 Interchange History Plans for a North Spokane Freeway date back to 1946. Earlier projects were cancelled due to other priorities and local opposition. The current project began construction in 2001. =Early plans= The idea of having a freeway run northward through Spokane was originally conceived in 1946 after the Spokane traffic survey that year. The city of Spokane needed some sort of a major north‚Äìsouth traffic facility to relieve congestion. After several reports and studies, the first plans for the freeway were released in 1956 with an estimated cost of just $13 million, however, those plans were quickly shelved in 1958 as the construction of the Interstate Highway System was prioritized over the construction of the north‚Äìsouth freeway. As a result, cheaper alternatives, such as one-way paired couplets, were discussed. In 1964, the Spokane Metropolitan Area Transportation Study (SMATS) was formed to fulfill requirements of Federal Highway Act of 1962, and in 1970, along with the Department of Highways, released the \\"Corridor Study for North Spokane and North Suburban Area Freeway\\". It recommended a north‚Äìsouth freeway along Hamilton and Nevada streets (the corridor between Nevada and Helena). Though a full freeway interchange was built connecting Hamilton Street with I-90 (exit 282/282A, connecting to State Route 290, SR 290), residents successfully blocked any further construction through this area. =Construction= View of a graded section of the NSC at the north terminus of the project After 33 years of further discussions and proposals, the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the current version of the project was approved in April 1997. The first phase of the NSC, consisting of grading between Hawthorne Road and US 2, broke ground in August 2001. The first ribbon cutting ceremony (for a segment of lanes between the Francis/Freya and Farwell interchanges) occurred on the eighth anniversary of the ground breaking, August 22, 2009. To reduce costs, the scope of construction was reduced in 2008, reducing the northmost portion from six lanes to four, eliminating part of the interchange at Wellesley Avenue, and constructing the freeway at ground level, rather than below. This reduced the cost of that portion from $720 million to $285 million, while still allowing for those improvements later. Aerial photograph from slightly east of south showing progress as of 2013) On June 13, 2012, the NSC opened a new section from the newly constructed interchange at US 2 to the new Wandermere/US 395 interchanges and lanes that link them, creating a free- flowing freeway segment from the US 395 interchange to the Francis/Freya interchange. All six lanes between US 2 and Francis/Freya are now completed and operational. This segment was completed in 2012 and includes the southbound lane section and a second roundabout for southbound traffic at Freya Street. The final project on the north half of the 10-mile route was the Parksmith Road Interchange. The new interchange, near the community of Mead, was opened in October, 2012. The freeway is now fully built from the Freya interchange to the Wandermere interchange. Commuters are also expected to use the newly opened segment as a faster way to access Bigelow Gulch, which leads to Argonne Road, where it leads to I-90. Traffic on Bigelow Gulch Rd is expected to increase. In Spokane's East Central district, the property acquisition process has been ongoing since June 2010 and includes the acquisition and demolition of 606 homes, businesses and industrial buildings. The first project in the south half of the corridor, the Francis Avenue Bridge replacement, has been completed and opened to traffic. The project consisted of removing the existing four-lane, bridge and constructing a , five-lane structure. The new bridge provides enough space for the future freeway lanes and railway lines to pass under Francis Avenue. The Francis Avenue Bridge opened to traffic in November, 2013. In June, 2012, WSDOT received TIGER Grant funding for the next project, which includes further construction of the Children of the Sun Trail into Hillyard, plus realignment of the railroad mainline and spur under the new structure. This phase of construction also includes two new freeway bridges and two new pedestrian/bike access bridges. In July 2015, the Connecting Washington transportation package was signed by Governor Jay Inslee, bringing $879 million in state funding for the completion of the North Spokane Corridor project. Construction on the southern half began in early 2017 with work on the Freya Street overpass and is the whole project is anticipated to be completed by 2027 or 2029, depending on funding. Grading and paving of a section between Freya Street and Central Avenue was completed in September 2019, but remains closed to traffic. Impacts The highway is expected to significantly improve traffic through north Spokane. In particular, the highway will allow trucks to avoid congested Division Street, formerly the only north‚Äìsouth truck route through the city. By moving cars from congested streets to a freeway, WSDOT predicts that it will reduce auto emissions by 3.6% annually and save a million gallons of fuel a year. It will also reduce predicted traffic growth on Interstate 90, as new residents move to the North Spokane area instead of elsewhere along the Interstate. There are 62 known or suspected hazardous waste sites in the freeway's path. A 1997 report by WSDOT noted that the construction of the southern portion of the freeway will require the demolition of over 500 homes and 100 business, necessitating the relocation of over 1,000 residents. Many of these homes and business are in the poorest and most ethnically diverse neighborhoods of the city. WSDOT purchased many properties in Hillyard and other neighborhoods in 2002. Businesses have been allowed to remaining operating until construction actually begins. Ziggy's store closed on November 20, 2010 after 45 years in business because of the construction of the freeway. Homes and churches have also been relocated. Based on history with the construction of Interstate 90, it is forecast that the North Spokane Corridor will result in substantial land-use changes in the area. The completion of I-90 resulted in growth in eastern suburbs that were once small towns, while many neighborhoods in the center of the city experienced poverty and decline. It is predicted that growth and development will occur near the interchanges of the new freeway while areas near connecting sections will remain poor neighborhoods. Whether modern growth management laws will prevent sprawl in northern suburbs is far from certain. The environmental impact statement predicted more development in Pend Oreille County and Deer Park north of the city. Exit list Currently, all six lanes are open from Freya Street (0.4 miles north of Francis Avenue) to the Newport Highway (US 2). The connection to Wandermere and the bridge over the Little Spokane River was complete and opened on June 13, 2012. The optional detour to connect from US 395 at Division Street and Francis Avenue to the North Spokane Corridor (NSC) on Freya Street is nearly three miles. However, Freya is a through street beginning from the Spokane River. The eastbound Newport Highway (US 2) has a different connection to the NSC from that of the westbound. * US 2 East to NSC south: Connector via Farwell with a full intersection at Shady Slope Road prior to entry. * US 2 East to NSC north: This has no direct on-ramp.

She is also referred to as the First Daughter of Wisdom. She was beatified by Pope John Paul II. Early life and background =Childhood and education= Trichet was born in Poitiers, on the Clain River in west central France on 7 May 1684 and baptized at the church of St. Etienne.Gaffney, Patrick, \\"Marie Louise of Jesus\\", Jesus Living in Mary: Handbook of the Spirituality of St. Louis de Montfort, Montfort Publications, Litchfield, CT, 1994 Her father Julien was a court magistrate in Poitiers and her mother Fran√ßoise Lecocq was deeply religious, as was most of her family. She was the fourth child and third daughter, and had seven siblings. The eldest, Jeanne, struck with paralysis at the age of thirteen, was cured three years later during a visit to Notre Dame des Ardilliers at Saumur. Her younger brother Alexis, born just one year earlier, was ordained a priest in 1710 and later died after volunteering to minister to plague stricken inmates in a prison camp. The youngest of her sisters later joined the Daughters of Wisdom. Trichet grew up in an atmosphere of religion and education, and when seven years old, was sent to the boarding school at Poitiers run by the Sisters of St. Jeanne de Lestonac to acquire the social qualifications suitable for the upper echelons of seventeenth-century France. =Poitiers= Baptist√®re Saint-Jean (4th century) in Poitiers The area of western France where she grew up had a strong Christian tradition. Poitiers is home to Baptist√®re Saint-Jean, reportedly the oldest extant Christian building in France. And the historic Battle of Tours was fought just 20 km north of Poitiers in the 8th century. Poitiers was also important in that in the 15th century the French royal parliament in exile moved from Paris to Poitiers. In the 16th century, Poitiers impressed visitors because of its relatively large size, royal courts, university, prolific printing shops, religious institutions, cathedral and numerous parishes. Poitiers General Hospital Yet the apparent affluence of Poitiers in the 17th century, prior to the French Revolution, had a less than royal side. France was plagued by corruption, and rampant poverty. At Poitiers, beggars, cripples and drunks were forcibly sent to a stone building called the General Hospital. The hospital inmates were only offered a common room, one bed for two or three, black bread and a stew of unknown origin ‚Äì and had to wear a rough gray uniform. In 1701, Father Louis de Montfort arrived in Poitiers, having been ordained a priest in June 1700, young and highly idealistic priest. He had a strong devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Holy Angels. Thus apart from offering mass and hearing confessions, Montfort used to spend much time with the poor of the Poitiers General Hospital, where he later became the chaplain. He tried to introduce rules and rights for the inmates, but met strong resistance from the hospital authorities. Meeting Louis de Montfort At seventeen, Trichet met for the first time Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort who had just been appointed chaplain of the hospital of Poitiers. Marie-Louise offered her services to the hospital, devoting most of her time to the poor and the sick. \\"Life of Blessed Marie-Louise Trichet\\", Company of Mary, Vice- Province of Great Britain and Ireland When she was nineteen, Montfort asked her to come and live there. Given that there was no official position for a governor at the hospital, despite her family background and education, she volunteered to enter the hospital \\"as an inmate\\". Trichet's parents were not pleased with her decision to enter the hospital as an inmate and her mother reportedly told her: \\"You will become as mad as that priest\\". On 2 February 1703 Marie Louis left her family, consecrated herself to God and received a religious habit from Montfort. Frustrated with the local bishops, Montfort set off to make a pilgrimage to Rome, to ask Pope Clement XI, what he should do. The Pope recognised his real vocation and, telling him that there was plenty of scope for its exercise in France, sent him back with the title of Apostolic Missionary. Thus Montfort left Poitiers and for several years he travelled on foot, preaching missions from Brittany to Nantes. His reputation as a missioner grew, and he became known as \\"the good Father from Montfort\\". At Poitiers hospital Before leaving, Montfort had established the Rule of the Daughters of Wisdom for the small congregation he had formed with Trichet as the first member. With the rule, to this day the congregation strives to acquire heavenly wisdom by imitating the Incarnate Wisdom, Jesus Christ. The means for imitating Christ is a special devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. After Montfort's departure, Trichet was left alone at the hospital to care for the sick while awaiting his occasional letters of encouragement. For ten years, Marie-Louise would fulfill her humble duty as a nurse. That was the beginning of a four decade effort during which she nursed the sick; gave food to beggars and administered the great maritime hospital of France. The poor people of the Hospital of Niort in Deux-S√®vres eventually came to call her \\"good Mother Jesus\\". For almost her entire youth, Trichet lived among the poor and the sick, and served them, following the Rule left by Montfort. Gradually, the duties entrusted to her increased and from 1708 she substituted for the official bursar, and in 1711 she was in complete charge of the hospital. In 1714, she was joined by Catherine Brunet. Daughters of Wisdom View of La Rochelle by Corot Bishop de Champflour of La Rochelle on the Atlantic coast just to the west of Poitiers had been impressed with Montfort for some time. Based on the bishop's invitation to Montfort, in 1715 Trichet and Catherine Brunet left Poitiers for La Rochelle to open a free religious school there.\\"In the Footsteps of Blessed Marie-Louise of Jesus\\", Footsteps, Spring 2003 (Volume 8, Issue 1), Company of Mary, Vice- Province of Great Britain and Ireland In a short time, the free school, supported by the bishop and following the program and rules laid down by Montfort, had 400 students. On 22 August 1715 Trichet and Brunet, along with Marie Valleau and Marie R√©gnier from La Rochelle received the approbation of Bishop de Champflour of La Rochelle to perform their religious profession under the direction of Montfort. At the ceremony Montfort told them: \\"Call yourselves the Daughters of Wisdom, for the teaching of children and the care of the poor.\\" =Following the path of Montfort= In April 1716 Montfort had gone to Saint- Laurent-sur-S√®vre to preach, where he fell ill and died on 28 April 1716. The thirty-two-year-old Trichet thus had to assume the full responsibility for the foundation. The Mother House at Saint-Laurent-sur-S√®vre In 1719 the sisters went back to Poitiers and later managed to establish a Mother House in 1720 at Saint-Laurent-sur-S√®vre in the Maison Longue (the long house), now a museum devoted to her life and the Daughters of Wisdom. But they had to live in abject poverty for several years, at times living on black bread alone and occasionally an egg. In time with providence and the dowries provided by certain new novices, they acquired land that produced some revenue. As Montfort had predicted, in time more novices arrived and the organization grew. In the thirty years that followed 1729 Trichet established thirty new charitable communities where the Daughters of Wisdom visited the poor, nursed the sick and taught children, with no payment, but supported by benefactors or parishioners. During the devastating famine of 1739 she begged the authorities to come to the rescue of the hungry. In the houses of providence the Sisters lived with orphans, the aged, and the handicapped. At the general hospitals at La Rochelle, or at Niort in Deux-S√®vres their services were hired to introduce a minimal level of peace, joy and order to the prevailing filth and disorder. =Last years and death= When she was 66 years old, Trichet undertook a long journey on horseback to visit all her communities, talk with the Sisters and inspire them. She always told the Sisters: \\"Your real Superior is Mary; I am but her servant.\\" That was her last trip, for upon returning to the Mother House at Saint-Laurent-sur-S√®vre she never left again. An accidental fall caused her months of suffering, followed by a final illness from which she did not recover. On her deathbed she called a benefactor to beg that the poor of the parish be cared for, after her death. Trichet died at Saint-Laurent-sur- S√®vre in Vend√©e on 28 April 1759, the same day and location where Louis de Montfort had died 43 years earlier on 28 April 1716. On Trichet's death, the congregation included 174 sisters distributed in 36 communities and the Mother House. After the persecutions during the French Revolution, the Daughters of Wisdom regrouped and grew again. They were awarded medals by the governments of France, Spain, Prussia, and Belgium for nursing the wounded or plague- stricken soldiers of those countries on many occasions. Legacy and beatification Montfort and Trichet rest in adjacent tombs in the church of Saint-Laurent-sur-S√®vre. The Daughters of Wisdom have since grown into a multi-national organization. On 16 May 1993 Trichet was beatified by Pope John-Paul II. In the process of examining her life prior to beatification, one cardinal wrote of her: :\\"She offers an example of how to work for the development of the whole human person in a spirit of sacrifice, looking for no reward, ever open to read the signs of the times with a serene and humble spirit.\\" On 19 September 1996 Pope John-Paul II came to meditate and pray on the tombs of Montfort and Trichet in Saint-Laurent-sur-S√®vre.

The term \\"regenerative\\" describes processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials. Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create resilient and equitable systems that integrate the needs of society with the integrity of nature. Designers use systems thinking, applied permaculture design principles, and community development processes to design human and ecological systems. The development of regenerative design has been influenced by approaches found in the biomimicry, biophilic design, ecological economics, circular economics. As well as social movements such as permaculture, transition and the new economy. Regenerative design can also refer to process of designing systems such as restorative justice, rewilding and regenerative agriculture. Feedback loop used in regenerative design A new generation of designers are applying ecologically inspired design to agriculture, architecture, community planning, cities, enterprises, economics and ecosystem regeneration. Many designers use the resilient models observed in systems ecology in their design process and recognize that ecosystems are resilient largely because they operate in closed loop systems. Using this model regenerative design seeks feedback at every stage of the design process. Feedback loops are an integral to regenerative systems[citation needed] as understood by processes used in restorative practice and community development. Regenerative design is interconnected with the approaches of systems thinking and with New Economy movement. The 'new economy' considers that the current economic system needs to be restructured. The theory is based on the assumption that people and the planet should come first, and that it is human well-being, not economic growth, which should be prioritized. Whereas the highest aim of sustainable development is to satisfy fundamental human needs today without compromising the possibility of future generations to satisfy theirs, the goal of regenerative design is to develop restorative systems that are dynamic and emergent, and are beneficial for humans and other species. This regeneration process is participatory, iterative and individual to the community and environment it is applied to. This process intends to revitalize communities, human and natural resources, and society as a whole. In recent years regenerative design is made possible on a larger scale using open source socio- technical platforms and technological systems as used in SMART cities. It includes community and city development processes like gathering feedback, participatory governance, sortition and participatory budgeting.  History  = Permaculture = The term permaculture was developed and coined by David Holmgren, then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and Bill Mollison, senior lecturer in environmental psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. The word permaculture originally referred to \\"permanent agriculture\\",Paull , John (2011) The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011, Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180. but was expanded to stand also for \\"permanent culture\\", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by Masanobu Fukuoka‚Äôs natural farming philosophy. Regenerative design is integral to permaculture design. In 1974, David Holmgren and Bill Mollison first started working together to develop the theory and practice of permaculture. They met when Mollison spoke at a seminar at the Department of Environmental Design and began to work together. During their first three years together Mollison worked at applying their ideas, and Holmgren wrote the manuscript for what would become Permaculture One: a perennial agricultural system for human settlements as he completed his environmental design studies, and submitted it as the major reference for his thesis. He then handed the manuscript to Mollison for editing and additions, before it was published in 1978. = Regenerative organic agriculture = Robert Rodale, son of American organic pioneer and Rodale Institute founder J.I. Rodale, coined the term ‚Äòregenerative organic agriculture.‚Äô The term distinguished a kind of farming that goes beyond simply ‚Äòsustainable.‚Äô Regenerative organic agriculture ‚Äútakes advantage of the natural tendencies of ecosystems to regenerate when disturbed. In that primary sense it is distinguished from other types of agriculture that either oppose or ignore the value of those natural tendencies.‚Äù This type of farming is marked by \\"tendencies towards closed nutrient loops, greater diversity in the biological community, fewer annuals and more perennials, and greater reliance on internal rather than external resources.\\" John T. Lyle (1934‚Äì1998), a landscape architecture professor saw the connection between concepts developed by Bob Rodale for regenerative agriculture and the opportunity to develop regenerative systems for all other aspects of the world. While regenerative agriculture focused solely on agriculture, Lyle expanded its concepts and use to all systems. Lyle understood that when developing for other types of systems, more complicated ideas such as entropy and emergy must be taken into consideration. = Regenerative design in the built environment = In 1976, Lyle challenged his landscape architecture graduate students at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona to \\"envision a community in which daily activities were based on the value of living within the limits of available renewable resources without environmental degradation.\\" Over the next few decades an eclectic group of students, professors and experts from around the world and crossing many disciplines developed designs for an institute to be built at Cal Poly Pomona. In 1994, the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies opened after two years of construction. In that same year Lyle's book Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development was published by Wiley. In 1995 Lyle worked with William McDonough at Oberlin College on the design of the Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies completed in 2000. In 2002 McDonough's book, the more popular and successful, Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things was published reiterating the concepts developed by Lyle. Swiss architect Walter R. Stahel developed approaches entirely similar to Lyle's also in the late 1970s but instead coined the term cradle-to-cradle design made popular by McDonough and Michael Braungart. Sim Van Der Ryn is an architect, author, and educator with more than 40 years of experience integrating ecological principles into the built environment. Author of eight publications, one of his most influential books titled Ecological Design, published in 1996, provides a framework for integrating human design with living systems. The book challenges designers to push beyond \\"green building\\" to create buildings, infrastructure and landscapes that truly restore and regenerative of the surrounding ecosystems.  Green vs. sustainable vs. regenerative  There is an important distinction that should be made between the words ‚Äògreen‚Äô, ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô, and ‚Äòregenerative‚Äô and how they influence design. = Green Design = In the article Transitioning from green to regenerative design, Raymond J. Cole explores the concept of regenerative design and what it means in relation to ‚Äògreen‚Äô and ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô design. Cole identifies eight key attributes of green buildings: # Reduces damage to natural or sensitive sites # Reduces the need for new infrastructure # Reduces the impacts on natural feature and site ecology during construction # Reduces the potential environmental damage from emissions and outflows # Reduces the contributions to global environmental damage # Reduces resource use ‚Äì energy, water, materials # Minimizes the discomfort of building occupants # Minimizes harmful substances and irritants within building interiors By these eight key attributes, ‚Äògreen‚Äô design is accomplished by reducing the harmful, damaging and negative impacts to both the environment and humans that result from the construction of the built environment. Another characteristic that separates ‚Äògreen‚Äô design is that it is aimed at broad market transformation and therefore green building assessment frameworks and tools are typically generic in nature. =Sustainable Design= Sustainable design lies within a balance of economical, environmental and social responsibilities ‚ÄòSustainable‚Äô and ‚Äògreen‚Äô are for the most part used interchangeably however, there is a slight distinction between then. ‚ÄòGreen‚Äô design is centralized around specifically decreasing environmental impacts from human development whereas sustainability can be viewed for an environmental, economic or social lens. The implication is that sustainability can be incorporated to all three aspects of the Triple Bottom Line: people, planet, profit. The definition of sustainable or sustainability has been widely accepted as the ability to meet the needs of the current generation without depleting the resources needed to meet the needs of future generations. It ‚Äúpromotes a bio-centric view that places the human presence within a larger natural context, and focuses on constraints and on fundamental values and behavioral change.‚Äù David Orr defines two approaches to sustainability in his book Ecological Literacy: ‚Äútechnological sustainability‚Äù and ‚Äúecological sustainability.‚Äù ‚ÄúTechnological sustainability‚Äù emphasizes the anthropocentric view by focusing on making technological and engineering processes more efficient whereas ‚Äúecological sustainability\\" emphasizes the bio-centric view and focuses on enabling and maintaining the essential and natural functions of ecosystems. The sustainability movement has gained momentum over the last two decades, with interest from all sectors increasing rapidly each year. In the book Regenerative Development and Design: A Framework for Evolving Sustainability, the Regenesis Group asserts that the sustainability ‚Äúdebate is shifting from whether we should work on sustainability to how we‚Äôre going to get it done.‚Äù Sustainability was first viewed as a ‚Äústeady state of equilibrium‚Äù in which there was a balance between inputs and outputs with the idea that sustainable practices meant future resources were not compromised by current processes. As this idea of sustainability and sustainable building has become more widely accepted and adopted, the idea of ‚Äúnet-zero‚Äù and even ‚Äúnet-positive‚Äù have become topics of interest. These relatively newer concepts focus on positively impacting the surrounding environment of a building rather than simply reducing the negative impacts. = Regenerative Design = J.T. Gibberd argued ‚Äúa building is an element set within wider human endeavors and is necessarily dependent on this context. Thus, a building can support sustainable patterns of living, but in and of itself cannot be sustainable‚Äù Regenerative design goes a step further than sustainable design. In a regenerative system, feedback loops allow for adaptability, dynamism and emergence to create and develop resilient and flourishing eco-systems. Cole highlights a key distinction of regenerative design is the recognition and emphasis of the ‚Äúco- evolutionary, partnered relationship between human and natural systems‚Äù and thus importance of project location and place. Bruno Duarte Dias asserts that regenerative design goes beyond the traditional weighing and measuring of various environmental, social and economic impacts of sustainable design and instead focuses on mapping relationships. Dias is in agreement with Cole stating three fundamental aspects of regenerative design which include: understanding place and its unique patterns, designing for harmony within place, and co-evolution.  Fundamental aspects of regenerative design  = Co-evolution of humans and nature = Regenerative design is built on the idea that humans and the built environment exist within natural systems and thus, the built environment should be designed to co-evolve with the surrounding natural environment. Dias asserts that a building should serve as a ‚Äúcatalyst for positive change.‚Äù The project does not end with the completion of construction and certificate of occupancy, instead the building serves to enhance the relationships between people, the built environment and the surrounding natural systems over a long period of time. = Designing in context of place = Understanding the location of the project, the unique dynamics of the site and the relationship of the project to the living natural systems is a fundamental concept in the regenerative design process. In their article Designing from place: a regenerative framework and methodology, Pamela Mang and Bill Reed define place as a \\"unique, multilayered network of living systems within a geographic region that results from the complex interactions, through time, of the natural ecology (climate, mineral and other deposits, soil, vegetation, water and wildlife, etc.) and culture (distinctive customs, expressions of values, economic activities, forms of association, ideas for education, traditions, etc.)\\" A systems-based approach to design in which the design team looks at the building within the larger system is crucial.  Gardener analogy  Beatrice Benne and Pamela Mang emphasize the importance of the distinction between working with a place rather than working on a place within the regenerative design process. They use an analogy of a gardener to re-define the role of a designer in the building process. ‚ÄúA gardener does not ‚Äòmake‚Äô a garden. Instead, a skilled gardener is one who has developed an understanding of the key processes operating in the garden‚Äù and thus the gardener ‚Äúmakes judicious decisions on how and where to intervene to reestablish the flows of energy that are vital to the health of the garden.‚Äù In the same way a designer does not create a thriving ecosystem rather they make decisions that indirectly influence whether the ecosystem degrades or flourishes over time. This requires designers to push beyond the prescriptive and narrow way of thinking they have been taught and use complex systems thinking that will be ambiguous and overwhelming at times. This includes accepting that the solutions do not exclusively lie in technological advancements and are instead a combination of sustainable technologies and an understanding of the natural flow of resources and underlying ecological processes. Benne and Mang identify these challenges and state the most difficult of these will be shifting from a mechanistic to an ecological worldview. The tendency is to view building as the physical processes of the structure rather than the complex network of relationships the building has with the surrounding environment including the natural systems and the human community. = Conservation vs. preservation = Regenerative design places more importance on conservation and biodiversity rather than on preservation. It is recognized in regenerative design that humans are a part of natural ecosystems. To exclude people is to create dense areas that destroy pockets of existing ecosystems while preserving pockets of ecosystems without allowing them to change naturally over time.  Regenerative design frameworks  There are a few regenerative design frameworks that have been developed in recent years. Unlike many green building rating systems, these frameworks are not prescriptive checklists. Instead they are conceptual and meant to guide dialogue throughout the design process. They should not be used exclusively rather in conjunction with existing green building rating systems such as LEED, BREEAM or Living Building Challenge. = SPeAR = Sustainable Project Appraisal Routine (SPeAR) is a decision-making tool developed by software and sustainability experts at Arup. The framework incorporates key categories including transportation, biodiversity, culture, employment and skills. = REGEN = The regenerative design framework REGEN was proposed by Berkebile Nelson Immenschuh McDowell (BNIM), a US architectural firm, for the US Green Building Council (USGBC). The tool was intended to be a web-based, data-rich framework to guide dialogue between professionals in the design and development process as well as \\"address the gap in information and integration of information.\\" The framework has three components: * Framework - the framework encourages systems thinking and collaboration as well as linking individual strategies to the goals of the project as a whole * Resources - the framework includes place-based data and information for project teams to use * Projects - the framework includes examples of successful projects that have incorporated regenerative ideas into the design as models for project teams = LENSES = Living Environments in Natural, Social and Economic Systems (LENSES) was created by Colorado State University's Institute for the Built Environment. The framework is intended to be process-based rather than product-based. The goals of the framework include: * to direct the development of eco-regional guiding principles for living built environments * to illustrate connections and relationships between sustainability issues * to guide collaborative dialogue * to present complex concepts quickly and effectively to development teams and decision-makers The framework consists of three \\"lenses\\": Foundational Lens, Aspects of Place Lens and Flows Lens. The lenses work together to guide the design process, emphasizing the guiding principles and core values, understanding the delicate relationship between building and place and how elements flow through the natural and human systems. = Perkins+Will = Perkins+Will is a global architecture and design firm with a strong focus on sustainability - by September 2012 the firm had completed over 150 LEED-certified projects. It was at the 2008 Healthcare Center for Excellence meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia that the decision was made to develop a regenerative design framework in an effort to generate broader conversation and inspirational ideas. Later that year, a regenerative design framework that could be used by all market sectors including healthcare, education, commercial and residential was developed by Perkins+Will in conjunction with the University of British Columbia. The framework had four primary objectives: * to initiate a different and expanded dialogue between the design team members and with the client and users, moving beyond the immediate building and site boundaries * to emphasize the opportunities of developed sites and buildings to relate to, maintain, and enhance the health of the ecological and human systems in the place in which they are situated * to highlight the ecological and human benefits that accrue from regenerative approaches * to facilitate the broader integration of allied design professionals - urban planners, landscape architects and engineers, together with other disciplines (ecologists, botanists, hydrologists, etc.) typically not involved in buildings - in an interdisciplinary design process The structure of the framework consists of four primary themes: * Representation of human and natural systems - the framework is representative of the interactions between humans and the natural environment and is built on the notion that human systems exist only within natural systems. Human needs are further categorized into four categories: individual human health and well-being, social connectivity and local community, cultural vitality and sense of place, and healthy community. * Representation of resource flows - the framework recognizes that human systems and natural systems are impacted through the way building relates to the land and engages resource flows. These resource flows include energy, water and materials. * Resource cycles - within the framework, resource flows illustrate how resources flow in and out of human and natural cycles whereas resource cycles focus on how resources move through human systems. The four sub-cycles included in the framework are produce, use, recycle and replenish. * Direct and indirect engagement with flows - the framework distinguishes between the direct and indirect ways a building engages with resource flows. Direct engagement includes approaches and strategies that occur within the bounds of the project site. Indirect engagement extends beyond the boundaries of the project site and can thus be implemented on a much larger scale such as purchasing renewable energy credits.  Case study - VanDusen Botanical Garden  The Visitor Centre at the VanDusen Botanical Garden in Vancouver, British Columbia was designed in parallel with the regenerative design framework developed by Perkins+Will. The site of the new visitor center was 17,575 m2 and the building itself 1,784 m2. A four stage process was identified and included: education and project aspirations, goal setting, strategies and synergies, and whole systems approaches. Each stage raises important questions that require the design team to define place and look at the project in a much larger context, identify key resources flows and understand the complex holistic systems, determine synergistic relationships and identify approaches that provoke the coevolution of both humans and ecological systems. The visitor centre was the first project that Perkins+Will worked on in collaboration with an ecologist. Incorporating an ecologist on the project team allowed the team to focus on the project from a larger scale and understand how the building and its specific design would interact with the surrounding ecosystem through its energy, water and environmental performance.  Regenerative design for retrofitting existing buildings  = Importance and implications = It is said that the majority of buildings estimated to exist in the year 2050 have already been built. Additionally, current buildings account for roughly 40 percent of the total energy consumption within the United States. This means that in order to meet climate change goals - such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change - and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, existing buildings need to be updated to reflect sustainable and regenerative design strategies. = Strategies = Craft et al. attempted to create a regenerative design model that could be applied to retrofitting existing buildings. This model was prompted by the large number of currently existing buildings projected to be present in 2050. The model presented in this article for building retrofits follows a ‚ÄòLevels of Work‚Äô framework consisting of four levels that are said to be pertinent in increasing the ‚Äúvitality, viability and capacity for evolution‚Äù which require a deep understanding of place and how the building interacts with the natural systems. These four levels are classified as either proactive or reactive and include regenerate, improve, maintain and operate. = Case Study =  University of New South Wales  Craft et al. present a case study in which the chemical science building at the University of New South Wales was retrofitted to incorporate these regenerative design principles. The strategy uses biophilia to improve occupants health and wellbeing by strengthening their connection to nature. The facade acts as a ‚Äúvertical ecosystem‚Äù by providing habitats for indigenous wildlife to increase biodiversity. This included the addition of balconies to increase the connection between humans and nature.  Regenerative agriculture  Regenerative farming or 'regenerative agriculture' calls for the creation of demand on agricultural systems to produce food in a way that is beneficial to the production and the ecology of the environment. It uses the science of systems ecology, and the design and application through permaculture. As understanding of its benefits to human biology and ecological systems that sustain us is increased as has the demand for organic food. Organic food grown using regenerative and permaculture design increases the biodiversity and is used to develop business models that regenerate communities. Whereas some foods are organic some are not strictly regenerative because it is not clearly seeking to maximize biodiversity and the resilience of the environment and the workforce. Regenerative agriculture grows organic produce through ethical supply chains, zero waste policies, fair wages, staff development and wellbeing, and in some cases cooperative and social enterprise models. It seeks to benefit the staff along the supply chain, customers, and ecosystems with the outcome of human and ecological restoration and regeneration.  Size of regenerative systems  The size of the regenerative system effects the complexity of the design process. The smaller a system is designed the more likely it is to be resilient and regenerative. Multiple small regenerative systems that are put together to create larger regenerative systems help to create supplies for multiple human-inclusive-ecological systems.

Examples of quantum imaging are quantum ghost imaging, quantum lithography, sub-shot-noise imaging, and quantum sensing. Quantum imaging may someday be useful for storing patterns of data in quantum computers and transmitting large amounts of highly secure encrypted information. Quantum mechanics has shown that light has inherent ‚Äúuncertainties‚Äù in its features, manifested as moment-to-moment fluctuations in its properties. Controlling these fluctuations‚Äîwhich represent a sort of ‚Äúnoise‚Äù‚Äîcan improve detection of faint objects, produce better amplified images, and allow workers to more accurately position laser beams.Newswise: Physicists Produce Quantum-Entangled Images Retrieved on June 12, 2008.  Quantum imaging methods  Quantum imaging can be done in different methods. One method uses scattered light from a free-electron laser. This method converts the light to quasi-monochromatic pseudo-thermal light. Another method known as interaction-free imaging is used to locate an object without absorbing photons. One more method of quantum imaging is known as ghost imaging. This process uses a photon pair to define an image. The image is created by correlations between the two photons, the stronger the correlations the greater the resolution. Quantum lithography is a type of quantum imaging that focuses on aspects of photons to surpass the limits of classical lithography. Using entangled light, the effective resolution becomes a factor of N lesser than the Rayleigh limit of \\\\Delta x = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2}. Another study determines that waves created by Raman pulses have narrower peaks and have a width that is four times smaller than the diffraction limit in classical lithography. Quantum lithography has potential applications in communications and computing. Another type of quantum imaging is called quantum metrology, or quantum sensing. This process essentially is method that achieves higher levels of accuracy than classical optics. It takes advantage of quanta (individual packets of energy) to create units of measurement. By doing this, quantum metrology enhances the limits of accuracy beyond classical attempts.  Real-world applications  As research in quantum imaging continues, more and more real-world methods arise. Two important ones are ghost imaging and quantum illumination. Ghost imaging takes advantage of two light detectors to create an image of an object that is not directly visible to the naked eye. The first detector is a multi-pixel detector that doesn‚Äôt view the subject object while the second, a single-pixel (bucket) detector, views the object. The performance is measured through the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNRs are important to determine how well an image looks as a result of ghost imaging. On the other hand, resolution and the attention to detail is determined by the number of ‚Äúspecks‚Äù in the image. Ghost imaging is important as it allows an image to be produced when a traditional camera is not sufficient. Quantum Illumination was first introduced by Seth Lloyd and collaborators at MIT in 2008 and takes advantage of quantum states of light. The basic setup is through target detection in which a sender prepares two entangled system, signal and idler. The idler is kept in place while the signal is sent to check out an object with a low- reflective rate and high noise background. A reflection of the object is sent back and then the idler and reflected signal combined to create a joint measurement to tell the sender one of two possibilities: an object is present or and object is absent. A key feature of quantum illumination is entanglement between the idler and reflected signal is lost completely. Therefore, it is heavily reliant on the presence of entanglement in the initial idler-signal system.  Current uses  Quantum imaging has a lot of potential to expand. If further researched, it could be used to store patterns of data in quantum computers and allow communication through highly encrypted information. Furthermore, better quantum imaging can allow improvement in detection of faint objects, amplified images, and accurate position of lasers. Today, quantum imaging (mostly ghost imaging) is used in areas of military and medical use. The military is able to use ghost imaging to detect enemies and objects in situations where the naked eye and traditional cameras fail. For example, if an enemy or object is hidden in a cloud of smoke or dust, ghost imaging allows an individual to know where a person is located and if they are an ally or foe. In the medical field, imaging is used to increase the accuracy and lessen the amount of radiation exposed to a patient during x-rays. Ghost imaging allows doctors to look at a part of the human body without having direct contact with it, therefore, lowering the amount of direct radiation to the patient. Similar to the military, it is used to look at objects that cannot be seen with the human eye such as bones and organs. References External links *Quantum Imaging Overview at Quantiki.

She published her memoir, My Life in Sarawak, in 1913. The memoir offers a rare glimpse of life in The Astana in Kuching and colonial Borneo. The Ranee became legendary during her lifetime as a woman of strength and intelligence, as well as on account of her status, which she shared with the other White Rajahs, of being at once an English subject and also an Asian monarch. Life Born Margaret Alice Lili de Windt, she was the daughter of Captain Joseph Clayton Jennyns de Windt, of Blunston Hall, and Elizabeth Sarah Johnson. Her brother, Harry de Windt, was a well-known explorer. Margaret de Windt married Rajah Charles at Highworth, Wiltshire on 28 October 1869. She was raised to the title of Ranee of Sarawak with the style of Her Highness upon their marriage. The marriage was arranged to solve the succession issue in Sarawak. She followed her spouse to Sarawak, where she became the first in her position, the previous (and first) Rajah being unmarried. The Astana was built specially for her as a wedding present by her spouse. Ranee Margaret Brook was described as intelligent, forceful, non-sentimental and with the ability to dominate by her presence and, though her relationship with Charles soon deteriorated, she secured an independent position for herself and left Charles in the 1870s. When her first children died in 1873, however, she returned to her husband temporarily to solve the succession issue. Once three more children were born, the couple separated again and lived estranged, with Rajah Charles living in Sarawak and Margaret in London, where she was at the centre of a social circle that included several of the leading literary talents of the 1890s, such as Oscar Wilde and Henry James. She financed the education of her sons by pawning the diamond Star of Sarawak, and arranged the marriages of her sons by organising social events for the British aristocracy and introducing her sons to daughters of the British nobility to marry. Her title of ranee or queen gave her a position in London society and through it she gave prestige to Sarawak.  Legacy  Fort Margherita, also in Kuching, was named after her. Fort Margherita was erected by Rajah Charles and named after his wife, the Ranee Margaret. Margaret Brooke composed the national anthem of Sarawak, the Gone Forth Beyond the Sea, in 1872. One of Oscar Wilde's fairy-tales, \\"The Young King\\", is dedicated to \\"Margaret, Lady Brooke, The Ranee of Sarawak\\".

It is a movie tie-in license of the Warner Bros. film Constantine, in turn inspired by the Vertigo / DC Comics comic book series, Hellblazer. Gameplay Players move John Constantine in an RPG-like style, collecting ammo, using an item to restore health and casting spells. Gameplay is a type of third-person shooter style, with changing camera views. Players can select from a variety of weapons to eliminate demons. Cutscenes initiate special missions or boss battles when they occur, giving a round of gameplay a different view. John can cast spells that can create lightning storms, expel demons, create swarms of flies or confuse enemies. Each requires the player to hit a sequence of keys within a small window of time, with John chanting at each keypress. The spells have been described by critics as being unimpressive, without much impact on play, making them feel like a supplement to the other weapons. Story The game stars John Constantine, the main character from the movie Constantine and the comic book series, Hellblazer, as he learns that unholy animals are somehow crossing into the realm of earth without care. He is then sent by his associate, Beeman, to investigate this problem. Along his investigation he meets up with Father Hennessy, who provides support, along with the Storm Crow spell. The game starts out as John is called in to dispel a demon from a little girl's body in a hotel. (Just like in the movie.) After the exorcism is completed, the girl wakes from her hypnosis, feeling better. The screen then cuts to Beeman's office, where John is being informed about the weakened line between Hell and Earth by Beeman. John then steps into a puddle in the corner of the room, utters an incantation and winds up in Hell. John sees people being chased and attacked by demon, and then sees them coming for him. He, depending on the player's choice, uses his gun, the first part of the Witch's Curse set, to slay these demons. He then starts searching around Hell for the first piece of the Holy Shotgun, while seeing the horrors of Hell with his own eyes. As he searches, more souls are attacked and more demons are seen fighting against John. At a dead end, he finds the second gun for the Witch's Curse set, but is grabbed by a bird-like demon and flown through the skies of Hell. He is dropped and then is ambushed by a hoard of demons - just in front of the holding stall of the Holy Shotgun piece. He then uses the water ampoule he was carrying and gets out of Hell. Now equipped with the Crucifier, John searches the rest of the storeroom, finding a grate that leads to the generator room. He shuts off the power and heads for the blocked area, which is filled with water. John utters the incantation and is sent to Hell. Reception The PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the Xbox version a score of one eight and three sixes for a total of 26 out of 40.

He is the co-founder and former CEO of Democracy Radio, an organization that created and produced progressive talk radio shows that included The Ed Schultz Show and The Stephanie Miller Show. After his tenure at Democracy Radio, he joined Air America Radio as Executive Vice President for Programming. Athans was formerly married to U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow. The couple divorced in May 2010. Early life and career Athans, of Greek descent, was born in Detroit, Michigan. He was a congressional aide in the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States Senate. Previous to his tenure as a staffer in Congress, he was elected to local office and served two terms as a Councilman and President of the Village Council in Oxford, Michigan. Athans is also a veteran of the United States Air Force and the Michigan Air National Guard. Career In 2002, Athans and radio industry veteran Paul Fiddick founded Democracy Radio, an organization dedicated to creating political balance on America's commercial radio airwaves. Their concept was to develop, fund and incubate progressive oriented talk programming and enlist radio networks to market the programs to stations around the country. Democracy Radio developed and produced talk shows that launched the national careers of Ed Schultz and Stephanie Miller, among others. On June 8, 2005, Democracy Radio sold its stake in The Ed Schultz Show to a new company headed by veteran radio executive Randy Michaels, the former CEO of Clear Channel Radio. In November 2005, Democracy Radio's partner in The Stephanie Miller Show, WYD Media headed by radio industry veteran Ron Hartenbaum, purchased Democracy Radio's shares and assumed sole ownership of the venture. On November 4, 2005, Athans stepped down as CEO of Democracy Radio. After stepping down from Democracy Radio, Athans became Executive Vice-President of Air America, a Progressive talk radio network. Athans was in charge of new program development to expand Air America's programming lineup. He also headed Air America's Washington, D.C. corporate office. After Air America underwent bankruptcy procedures in late 2006, Athans founded TalkUSA Radio, a radio production company. Talk USA launched The Leslie Marshall Show and Washington Monthly on the Radio into national syndication. Athans, an occasional contributor to The Huffington Post, resides in Saint Clair Shores, Michigan and is currently Chief Development Officer of NRM Streamcast, a digital entertainment network based in Michigan. Legal issues In February 2008, Athans was detained in Troy, Michigan, as part of a prostitution sting and admitted to paying for a sex act. At the time, he was married to U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan). Athans was not charged, but was ticketed for driving with a suspended driver license. In April, Athans made a public statement, \\"No words can fully express how sorry I am.

Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 90 with New Book of Tang, vol. 114. ‚Äì December 27, 709ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ), n√© Lu Qinwang (ÁõßÊ¨ΩÊúõ), formally Duke Yuan of Rui (ËäÆÂÖÉÂÖ¨), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty and Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty, serving several terms as chancellor during the reigns of Wu Zetian and her son Emperor Zhongzong.  Background  Doulu Qinwang might have been born in 630, and it is known that his family was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an. His family traced its ancestry to Murong Yun (ÊÖïÂÆπÈÅã), a younger brother of Former Yan's founder Murong Huang (Prince Wenming), and after Murong Yun's descendants became subjects of Northern Wei, they were known as the family that surrendered in righteousness‚Äîa concept that, in the Xianbei language, was called \\"Doulu,\\" and therefore had their family name changed to Doulu. Doulu Qinwang's great- grandfather Doulu Tong (Ë±ÜÁõßÈÄö) served as a provincial governor and carried the title of Duke of Nanchen during Tang's predecessor Sui Dynasty, as he had married one of the sisters of Emperor Wen of Sui. His son and Doulu Qinwang's grandfather, Doulu Kuan (Ë±ÜÁõßÂØ¨), was thus a nephew of Emperor Wen,Doulu Qinwang's biography in the Old Book of Tang indicated that Doulu Kuan was a nephew of Emperor Wen, but Doulu Qinwang's biography in the New Book of Tang indicated that Doulu Kuan was a grandson of Emperor Wen, implied that Doulu Tong married a daughter, not a sister, of Emperor Wen. Doulu Tong's biography in the Book of Sui indicated that he married Emperor Wen's sister Princess Changle. See Book of Sui, vol. 39. and served as a county magistrate. When Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu rebelled against Sui rule in 617 and conquered the Guanzhong region (i.e., the region around Chang'an), Doulu Kuan surrendered, and Emperor Gaozu gave a daughter to Doulu Kuan's son (Doulu Qinwang's uncle) Doulu Huairang (Ë±ÜÁõßÊá∑ËÆì) in marriage, and changed the family's name to Lu, pursuant to the edict that Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei had issued in 496 to have Xianbei names changed to Han names. Doulu Qinwang therefore would have been born with the family name of Lu. However, in 640, when Doulu Kuan died, Emperor Gaozu's grandson Emperor Gaozong changed the family's name back to Doulu. Doulu Qinwang's father Doulu Chengye (Ë±ÜÁõßÊâøËëâ) had a general title, but his acts are otherwise unrecorded in history.New Book of Tang, vol. 74, part 2  During Wu Zetian's reign  Doulu Qinwang had at one point served as the commandant at Yue Prefecture (Ë∂äÂ∑û, roughly modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), and as of 693, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian, was serving as the minister of vassal affairs (Âè∏Ë≥ìÂçø, Sibin Qing), when Wu Zetian promoted him to the post of Neishi (ÂÖßÂè≤) ‚Äì the head of the legislative bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge) and a post considered one for a chancellor. In 694, there was an incident where Doulu, without informing the other officials what the contents of his petition was, ordered the other officials to sign a petition‚Äîwhich, without their knowledge, contained an offer for all officials to give up two months of salary in order to aid in the war effort against Eastern Tujue. When Doulu's subordinate Wang Qiuli (ÁéãÊ±ÇÁ¶Æ) objected, on the account that the low level officials would not be able to support themselves if they gave up two months of salary, Doulu refused to listen, and Wang directly reported it in person to Wu Zetian. Eventually, the matter of having the officials giving up two months of salary was not further mentioned. In late 694, Wu Zetian, displeased with the powerful chancellor Li Zhaode, exiled Li, and fellow chancellor Zhou Yunyuan and the assistant chief judge of the supreme court, Huangfu Wenbei (ÁöáÁî´ÊñáÂÇô), then submitted articles of impeachment against Doulu and several fellow chancellors ‚Äì Wei Juyuan, Du Jingjian, Su Weidao, and Lu Yuanfang ‚Äì for not being able to curb Li Zhaode's power. The five chancellors so accused were all demoted to be prefectural prefect‚Äîin Doulu's case, to be the prefect of Zhao Prefecture (Ë∂ôÂ∑û, roughly modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). In 695, Doulu was recalled to serve as the minister of ceremony (Âè∏Á¶ÆÂçø, Sili Qing), and then was made the minister of justice (ÁßãÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Qiuguan Shilang) and created the Duke of Rui, a title that his grandfather Doulu Kuan had carried. He was subsequently commissioned to tour the prefectures north of the Yellow River. In 697, he was serving as the head of the household of Wu Zetian's son and crown prince Li Dan (formerly emperor), when she made him Wenchang You Xiang (ÊñáÊòåÂè≥Áõ∏), one of the heads of the executive bureau (ÊñáÊòåËá∫, Wenchang Tai), and gave him the designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. In 698, however, he was removed from those posts and made an advisor to Li Dan. Later that year, after Li Dan yielded the position of crown prince to his brother Li Xian, also formerly an emperor, Doulu continued to serve as an advisor to Li Xian.  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, and Li Xian was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). He made Doulu Qinwang a head of the executive bureau (now renamed Shangshu Sheng (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ)) again‚Äînow with the title changed to Pushe (ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ). However, this created an ambiguity as to whether Doulu was a chancellor, as, while officials serving as Pushe had, in the reigns of Emperor Gaozu and his son Emperor Taizong, been considered chancellors, during Emperor Gaozong's reign, he rarely had them serve without also the de facto chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ) (later changed by Wu Zetian to Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin), thus creating a question whether Pushe without such designation were still chancellors. (The Pushe during Emperor Gaozong's reign would therefore generally rule on exclusively executive bureau jurisdiction matters in the morning and rule on national matters in the afternoon.) Doulu's colleague as Pushe, Tang Xiujing, carried the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin, but Doulu did not, and he therefore did not dare to involve himself in national affairs discussions. Emperor Zhongzong had to clarify the situation by shortly issuing an edict clarifying that Doulu had the authority to serve as a chancellor. However, this edict also appeared to have the effect that, from this point on, heads of the executive bureau who did not carry de facto chancellor designations were no longer considered chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 208. In 706, Doulu received the honorific title of Kaifu YItong Sansi (ÈñãÂ∫úÂÑÄÂêå‰∏âÂè∏) and assumed the additional responsibility as secretary general to Li Dan, then the Prince of Xiang. In 708, he requested retirement, but the request was rejected. He died later that year and was buried with honors near the tomb of Emperor Gaozong and Wu Zetian. It was said that while serving as chancellor during Wu Zetian's and Emperor Zhongzong's reigns, Doulu was careful in his own behavior and did not dare to curb the powers of Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, as well as Wu Zetian's nephew Wu Sansi the Prince of Dejing, who became exceedingly powerful in Emperor Zhongzong's reign due to his personal influence on Emperor Zhongzong and his affair with Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife Empress Wei. Doulu was much criticized by popular opinion at the time.  References  Sources * Old Book of Tang, vol. 90. * New Book of Tang, vol. 114. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 205, 206, 208, 209.

Located on the A631 between Gainsborough and Bawtry, it is part of Bassetlaw district. The parish includes the village of Harwell. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 839. There are 23 grade II listed buildings in the village. The village is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086‚Äì7 as Evretone. Everton was originally a Danish settlement by the name of Eofor-tun. For the majority of its history Everton's inhabitants have been farmers. Everton is twinned with the French village of Bouy in Champagne Ardenne, France. Everton Mill was a four-storey brick tower windmill built c. 1820. It was sold along with a watermill to farmer James Taylor by Will Templence in 1848.Nottinghamshire Archive ref, DDM 24/6 25 March 1848 The sails were removed in 1930, the mill being worked by steam engines installed in 1898 in a nearby engine house. The mill was still working in the 1940s but was closed c. 1950 and the machinery dismantled. The mill tower is still standing.Shaw, T. (1995). Windmills of Nottinghamshire. Page 20. Nottingham: Nottinghamshire County Council. Holy Trinity The White Swan, Drakeholes moorings Holy Trinity Church, Everton was built shortly after the Norman conquest in 1066. The church went through several changes, the first being between 1150‚Äì1180 A.D., and was due to the increase in the number of worshippers. In later years gargoyles were added.  Inclosure and Drainage Act 1833  On 24 July 1833 the Inclosure & Drainage Act was passed, which enabled the improvement of the drainage of Everton in 1860, which by this time was grossly inadequate.  Anthony Gilby  Anthony Gilby was an MP from circa 1646 to circa 1675. He came from a lower upper class Lincolnshire family. He became wealthy after marrying a Nottinghamshire heiress. An active royalist, he joined the Newark garrison under Lord Belasyse until the signing of the articles of surrender in 1646. In 1650 he was fined ¬£25 for being, according to the local major- general, ' a dangerous enemy '. For his collaboration in a projected rising in 1655 Anthony found himself imprisoned. By 1675 Anthony had helped pass several Parliamentary Acts and Bills. He also received the government whip. Proximally four years later he offered his services to Hull for the coming Parliament, but was turned down due to the discovery that he had embezzled ¬£650 worth of lead and 12,000 bricks, belonging to the Hull garrison. He escaped being proceeded against, 'in consideration of his loyal and eminent services'. He was buried at Everton on 27 April 1682. Everton's SSSI Everton has an SSSI 2 hectares in area.

Studio of Sir Godfrey Kneller The Hampton Court Beauties are a series of eight portraits by Sir Godfrey Kneller, commissioned by Queen Mary II of England, depicting the most glamorous ladies from the court of William III. They adorn the state rooms of King William III at Hampton Court Palace. They were probably originally commissioned to hang in the \\"water room\\" at Hampton court, however after his wife's death in 1699, William moved them to \\"the eating room downstairs\\" where they currently hang. Hampton Court also houses the Windsor Beauties by Sir Peter Lely, depicting the most beautiful ladies of the court of King Charles II of England, a generation before. However unlike the Windsor Beauties, the Hampton Court Beauties were not mistresses of the King, but attendants to Queen Mary. In contrast to the three quarter sized Windsor beauties, they are more formally posed, and full length. They are of a plainer, less erotic style reflecting a more moralistic society, and the desire to \\"rebrand\\" the monarchy accordingly. Later critics such as Hazlitt and Fuseli still found them problematic, Hazlitt describing them as \\"painted, tawdry\\", and by 1835 the earlier set of \\"bold meritricious hussies\\" had been sent from Windsor to join them at the more informal setting of Hampton Court. Both sets were part of the exhibition \\"The Wild, the Beautiful and the Damned\\" in 2012.

The University is the brainchild of Luke Boshier and his volunteer program based in Port St. Johns.  Overview  Sicambeni is in the old Transkei, an area made nominally independent under the old apartheid government and then forgotten and neglected. It still lags behind the rest of the country in development and progress. Poverty and unemployment are at high levels and the need for a sustainable community model that can not only work but be spread and taught from community to community is a crucial stepping stone in rebuilding communities and regaining their connection with their land. There are many immigrants from this area in cities including Durban (Northern sea port) and Port Elizabeth (Southern sea port) that left in search of an infrastructure within which they could exist, even if it means eking out a living on the fringes of the city and sending money back. Boshier quit the restaurant industry to move into the field of rural development when he decided the modern environment was no longer healthy for him.Carte Blanche He has massive experience in helping develop rural communities and, in particular, helps spread knowledge on building using unburnt bricks.Shack / Slum Dwellers International [Sdi] Boshiers idea of drying the bricks in the sun thereby saving hardwood trees that were being used to fire the kilns in Malawi was instrumental in preventing major deforestation. He is fascinated at how the people have changed along with the development of the gardens and small dam starting to look at their environment differently and finding ideas of their own to solve their own problems. ‚ÄúChanging people and their beliefs and perspectives of themselves and where they fit into the bigger picture is what this all about. They‚Äôre learning and growing to an extent where they can pass it on to others. The key to this project is not simply to give away money as that simply creates a dependence on the giver.‚Äù Starting off with the basics of improving waste and water management and setting out areas for planting seeds the project has yielded crops as diverse as cabbage, spinach, radish, chilies, lettuce and various types of squash and herbs. It also boasts a small dam dug by the workers to catch the rainwater runoff from the spring rains that came in September. There is a fledgling brick making operation as well as coffee seeds planted with a growing area laid out for a plantation. The University focuses on helping the local communities stop major migration from the country to the cities in search of work by getting them back to a state of sustaining themselves off the lands as well as making a profit from cash crops in order to bring some cash back into the villages. The University is up and running, growing daily it is still a work in progress and not being a government project, requires funding from investors and partners.  From small beginnings  Sicambeni Rural University succeeded with the first garden helped by the small dam created by community workers. The success prompted further interest from the community and further land on the other side of the small river was released for the use of the volunteer program. One of the initial ideas of the program was brick making but due to a lack of manpower as well as the proper mix of sand it was discontinued. However, this part of the program is due for another kick start in July 2008. Volunteers come and go. Many stay for longer than intended but all take something away with them. The education in life skills in the community is not something limited to the community members as it has become a two-way street. Originally members of the program and volunteers stayed at Amapondo Backpackers at Second Beach. As the volunteer core grew bigger they were moved to The Jetty alongside the Umzimvubu river in tranquil surroundings. Recent developments have seen the project crew spending more time up in Sicambeni Village at the outdoor University, living the projects they are putting together. The possibility of a permanent move has been discussed but no date has yet been set. The Jetty saw time as a home base as well as the location for a massive compost heap courtesy of fruit donated from the local Boxer supermarket. The ultimate aim of Amapondo Projects is, to create a sustainable community in Sicambeni that can survive food price increase and food shortages by preparing and planning to successfully live off the land. In the process, the projects crew have been doing a similar kind of thing with gardens up at Forest Glade near the Jetty supplying them with plenty of fresh produce. The Sicambeni Community that learn and understand how the sustainable ethos works can then in turn teach others. It is an old concept of spreading an idea but it is also one with projects and the Sicambeni Rural University where each member of the community has a vested interest, their own survival away from a dependence on handouts from business or government. Ranking  New crops are introduced  The initial crops planted were too focused on leafy vegetables and needed a dose of root vegetables to enable the community to have a staple, balanced diet. Potatoes and carrots as well as rice and sorghum were planted.  Sustainability as an achievable goal.  People have been living off the land for centuries, even millennia and the only thing that has changed is the culture of handouts from government and big business that breeds a culture of dependence amongst rural people who would otherwise be quite capable of sustaining themselves by living off the land. The project has managed to instill a pride and a return of dignity to people who are experiencing, many for the first time, that they can take ownership of their lives, make decisions and contribute in a community that can sustain itself and its members. The aim of this venture is to build a sustainable village project that not only supports itself but is a foundation for moving into surrounding communities and spreading the idea at the same time as planting seeds in the ground. Regaining a place in the earth cycle and ending a process of simply being a consumer is the key to building sustainable and productive communities in rural Africa. The engrained feeling of being a victim and floating along at the mercy of the ebb and flow of human dynamics that one has no control over has been the lot of the citizens of Africa and other third world countries for decades. Decisions made by multinational corporations and 1st world countries regarding trade, the environment, agriculture and economic control of the planet seldom include African and other 3rd world problems in the decision making process. This is a top down system and makes no space for revitalization and empowerment from the bottom up. Arbitrary decisions based on politics, ego and building a specific brand with advertising on 4x4 motor vehicles do not contribute to finding lasting and sustainable solutions to poverty, starvation, unemployment and the other scourges that beset Africa and the 3rd world. In order to address this gulf, that separates not only decision making processes but also the list of priorities that potential communities at the bottom work with compared to their well off counterparts at the top, it is necessary for people to forge their own progress around communities built around people and not political agendas. Choices made by the community and built on are an important empowering factor in freeing people from a dependence on factors beyond their control. From this freedom stems a direct increase in self belief and identity with a community, a cause that is greater than the individual. This vision of a living, dynamic community organism can be a living model for the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.

The new school quickly outgrew the available space and had to be moved to the White School, where the Memorial Auditorium is located today. Plans for a new high school building were developed.Colored Postcard of Fresno High School in 1896 In September 1896, the school year began in the new building on 0 Street between Stanislaus and Tuolumne streets. The new back structure, with its clock tower, had the latest and most modern facilities, including a chemistry laboratory, gymnasium, library, and lecture hall. In 1922, the school moved to its present site at 1839 North Echo Avenue, near Palm and McKinley Avenues. Fresno High School is surrounded by large homes (originally one of Fresno's affluent areas) and large Fresno ash and pine trees. In 2002 the historic Royce Hall building caught fire and suffered minimal damage. The campus is divided into several components. The two main components are \\"South Side\\" and \\"North Side\\", named so from their campus location. South Side campus houses Title I offices, the business, foreign language, science, and mathematics divisions. The North Side houses English, social sciences, art, and history divisions. Physical education, leadership and JROTC are housed on the westernmost portion of the campus. The drama and music divisions, in addition to various miscellaneous classrooms, are attached to Fresno High's historic Royce Hall. There is a little known of fallout shelter entrance at the rear of the handball courts, (in the middle where the metal grate is on the ground), that goes down stairs to a door that leads under \\"goat hill\\" and then under Royce Hall. Renovations to Royce Hall were completed for the 2018‚Äì2019 school year. They were worked on throughout the 2017‚Äì2018 school year. The goal was to give the historic hall a modernization which included new carpeting, acoustic sound paneling, a sound booth located near the auditorium entrance and the removal and relocation of a handicap elevator to make more room for stair access to the stage.  Academics  Fresno High School offers its students the full International Baccalaureate diplomas. The school has been offering its graduate students full IB diplomas since June 2007. The campus offers several advanced placement courses and requires the study of foreign language in order to receive a diploma, along with the completion of a 4,000 word essay and 150 hours of community service. The campus has received poor academic achievement scores in the past, but it has shown impressive improvement. The campus employs 133 full- and part-time instructors, in addition to several guidance counselors, classified staff, administrative employees, one full-time psychologist and one full-time family therapist. The curriculum has been broadened to meet the needs of the world's professions. However the opportunity to pursue a classical education, including the study of Latin, is still available to the students of Fresno High School. The campus offers Spanish and Latin language courses.  Performing arts  Fresno High is home to numerous Performing Arts which are offered to students as elective courses. Performing arts courses that are offered currently consist of: Theater, which includes IB Level options, Piano 1&2, Marching Band, Concert Band, Jazz Band, Intermediate Symphonic Orchestra, Advanced Symphonic Orchestra, Concert Choir and Chamber Choir.  Sports  Fresno High is an active athletic school, maintaining several teams for both boys and girls in addition to several co-ed teams. The Fresno High football team continues \\"the oldest high school rivalry West of the Mississippi\\" known as the Little Big Game. The Little Big Game also known as the Pig Game is an annual game in which Fresno High plays against its rival Roosevelt High School for a pig statue to hold for that year. The pig was at one time stolen from Fresno High's attendance office and a replacement was made. The campus offers Prep and Cheer, football, cross country, soccer (valley champion 2010‚Äì2011 season), baseball, golf, tennis, water polo, softball teams, basketball, track and field, swim, badminton, and a lacrosse team.

Biography =Early life= Young was born in 1925 in Turua on the Hauraki Plains. The son of Leslie Robert Young, he grew up in Cambridge and Blenheim, and attended Wellington College. He married Ailsa Hazel Anderson, the daughter of John James Anderson, in 1952. They had two sons. Young and his family settled in Naenae and he gained employment with the Public Trust. He had other jobs with the New Zealand Forest Service and Ministry of Defence before becoming the general superintendent of the New Zealand Alliance, an organisation opposed to the sale of alcoholic beverages. He studied law studies part-time at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating in 1958 with an LLB. =Political career= Young joined the Labour Party and in 1947, Young became a Lower Hutt city councillor at the age of 22. He remained a member of the city council until 1968 when he resigned upon his election to Parliament. He represented the electorate of Hutt (previously occupied by Labour Prime Minister Sir Walter Nash) in Parliament from 1968 to 1978, and then the Eastern Hutt electorate from 1978 to 1990, when he was replaced by Paul Swain. In total he gave 43 years of service in local and national politics. He was the chair of the New Zealand branch of Parliamentarians for Global Action. From 1974 until 1978 he was the Labour Party's junior whip. He was Shadow Minister of Energy (1976‚Äì79), Shadow Minister of Tourism (1979‚Äì80) and Shadow Minister of Police (1983‚Äì84). From 1984 to 1990 he was the deputy Chairman of Committees. According to Western Hutt MP John Terris Young was never afraid to speak his mind and his forthright manner and Christian values probably cost him political advancement. In 1983 he faced a challenge for the Eastern Hutt nomination by electorate secretary, and former Invercargill MP, J. B. Munro. Both men were friends but differed on social policies and local members coalesced in two groups; with liberal members behind Munro while those more conservative backed Young. Prior to the selection meeting the two had agreed to avoid ill-feeling and retain their productive working relationship. The agreement was reaffirmed after Young won the vote and was given a standing ovation by the 250 members in attendance. He was also associated with the temperance (prohibition) movement. He was likewise a member of Amnesty International and patron of the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards from 1987 to 1995. In the 1988 Queen's Birthday Honours, Young was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. =Later life and death= Young studied to learn Swedish and became a director of Ansvar Insurance. He remained politically active and even at the age of 80 was delivering leaflets and canvassing votes at the for Rimutaka Labour MP Chris Hipkins. On 13 May 2012, Young died at the age of 86.

Terrestrial (DVB-T), Cable (DVB-C), and Satellite (DVB-S). In addition IPTV services are available. At the end of the first quarter of 2013 almost 84% of the households in the Netherlands had some form of digital television. Terrestrial The Netherlands was the second European country to complete the move to digital terrestrial broadcasting on December 11, 2006. The switch- off was helped greatly by the fact that about 90% of the households have cable that continues to use analog distribution. Due to the very extensive penetration of cable systems, usage of terrestrial television in the Netherlands is largely confined to remote rural areas and for portable televisions in caravans, etc. Since then all terrestrial television broadcast in the Netherlands are digital. The national public television channels NPO 1, NPO 2, NPO 3 and the regional public television channels are free-to-air. DVB-T2 transmissions in the Netherlands are provided commercially by KPN daughter company Digitenne. They offer 25 TV channels and 16 radio channels, including the free-to-air channels. The Digitenne service uses Conax encryption. =Handheld= KPN launched a DVB-H service MobileTV on Thursday, June 5, 2008 with a bouquet of ten channels. The ten channels are NPO 1, NPO 3, RTL 4, RTL 24, SBS 6, Disney XD (Netherlands)/Veronica, MTV, Discovery Channel, Xite and Nick Toons. RTL24 is a made-for-mobile channel with news and current affair. Xite is a new Dutch music channel. In November 2008, a new dedicated mobile TV channel was added. Nu.tv from Ilse Media and the nu.nl news web site. The service was closed on June 1, 2011, KPN is now using the freed up capacity for adding new channels to its Digitenne DTT platform. Cable Over 90% of the households in the Netherlands receive their television signal by cable, making it one of the highest cable penetrated countries. Some cable viewers still watch analogue because no set-top box is necessary. But with the uptake of LCD and plasma televisions customers are looking for better picture quality in digital cable. In addition digital cable offers hundreds of channels compared to the about thirty channels analogue cable offers. All the major cable companies in the Netherlands offer a digital television service. They all use the DVB-C standard for their digital signal but use different encryption techniques, most used are Irdeto 2 and Nagravision. The largest cable company, Ziggo, supports the CI+ standard making it possible for their customers to use televisions with an integrated digital tuner without the need for an additional set-top-box. All cable companies offer a number of high-definition channels. The most watched channels are being transmitted in the clear on the Ziggo and Caiway digital cable networks. The three largest cable companies in the Netherlands are: * Ziggo * Caiway * DELTA Satellite Digital satellite television in the Netherlands is available via CanalDigitaal, using the SES' Astra satellites at 19.2¬∞ east and 23.5¬∞ east. Services from both satellite positions can be received using a single dish with a Duo LNB, specifically designed for this purpose. It is only possible to register as a customer of CanalDigitaal using a Dutch postal address, due to copyright restrictions. A standard DVB-S receiver is used, which can also receive other free-to-air broadcasts. CanalDigitaal uses the Mediaguard/Nagravision encryption. In 2017 a second provider of digital satellite television began its services named Joyne, using the Eutelsat's Eurobird satellites at 9¬∞ east. Joyne uses the Conax encryption. IPTV Since May 1, 2006 KPN offers Mine TV, an IPTV service based on their DSL service, with the ability to receive Video on demand and replay a missed TV episodes besides regular TV programming. During 2007, the KPN service was renamed KPN Interactieve TV. Tele2 also offers an IPTV service called Tele2Vision. Since mid-2008 XMSNET also has started the rollout of IPTV over their FTTH (Fiber To The Home) network in several cities in the Netherlands. High definition In the Netherlands customers can receive high-definition television channels by cable or satellite and DVB-T2. =History= The first trials with high-definition television in the Netherlands began in the summer of 2006 with the broadcast of the 2006 World Cup in HD. The games where broadcast by the Netherlands Public Broadcasting (NPO) broadcaster NOS on a temporary 720p HD version of the NPO 2 channel. Only the live games where broadcast in HD, images from the studio and interviews were still SD. The NPO 2 HD channel went off-air after the World Cup. The larger cable companies continued a HD service with a small number of general interest channels like Discovery HD and National Geographic Channel HD. But because no Dutch network had made the move to HD, already broadcast in widescreen and the quality of the standard-definition PAL signal was good enough for most people, demand was low. Since the 2006 trials none of the main Dutch networks made the move to HD until the summer of 2008 when from June 1 until August 24, 2008 the NPO made their primary channel, NPO 1 temporary available in HD. This made it possible to broadcast Euro 2008, the 2008 Tour de France, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in HD and additionally allowed them to test their systems before the scheduled launch of their permanent HD service. Technicolor Netherlands, the company responsible for the technical realisation of the broadcasts for all the NPOs television and radio channels, began the summer 2008 test broadcast of NPO 1 HD in 720p and by doing so following the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) recommendations for HD broadcasting. During the test period an additional 1080i version of the channel was made available to the cable companies because of quality complaints from viewers. On July 4, 2009 the NPO started their permanent HD service when all three channels, NPO 1, NPO 2, and NPO 3, began simulcasting in 1080i high-definition. Most programming in the early stages is upscaled as in time more programs will become available in native HD. On October 15, 2009 RTL Nederland started simulcasting their RTL 7 and RTL 8 channels in 1080i high-definition. RTL Nederland then also announced plans for HD versions of their two other channels, RTL 4 and RTL 5, for 2010. Also these are available in HD since then. =Current= The Netherlands has ten main television channels, three public and seven commercial. All main television channels are simulcasted in high-definition. Furthermore other general interest high-definition channels are available with Dutch audio or subtitles. Main Dutch channels that broadcast in HD: * NPO 1 (started 4 July 2009) * NPO 2 (started 4 July 2009) * NPO 3 (started 4 July 2009) * RTL 4 (started 2010) * RTL 5 (started 2010) * RTL 7 (started 15 October 2009) * RTL 8 (started 15 October 2009) * RTL Z (started 7 September 2015) * SBS 6 (started 2010) * Veronica (started 2010) * NET 5 (started 2010) * SBS 9 (started 2014) * Fox (started 2013) Other HD channels available in the Nederlands: * 24Kitchen HD * Al Jazeera English HD * Animal Planet HD * BBC First HD * BBC World News HD * Boomerang HD * Cartoon Network HD * CNN HD * Comedy Central HD * DanceTelevision HD * Discovery HD * Discovery Science HD * Disney Channel HD * Disney Junior HD * Disney XD HD * E!

In a racing career which lasted from August 1984 until September 1985 she won seven of her nine races, starting favourite on each occasion, and never at odds of more than 2/1. She was one of the leading two-year-old fillies of 1984 when she was unbeaten in three races including the Fillies' Mile. In the following year Oh So Sharp won the 1000 Guineas in record time and then took The Oaks by six lengths before being narrowly beaten in her next two starts in major weight-for-age races. She completed the Triple Crown in the St Leger Stakes, despite failing to reproduce her best form. She was retired at the end of the season and became a successful broodmare. Oh So Sharp died in 2001 at the age of nineteen. Background Oh So Sharp, described by Timeform as \\"a big, lengthy filly and a grand mover with a raking stride\\" was bred in Ireland by her owner Sheikh Mohammed. She was one of two classic winners sired by Kris the leading British miler of 1979: the chestnut Oh So Sharp came from his first crop of foals. Her dam was the American-bred mare Oh So Fair, making her a half-sister to Roussalka a filly which won the Coronation Stakes and two runnings of the Nassau Stakes when trained by Henry Cecil in the mid-1970s. She later became a successful broodmare, whose descendants include Collier Hill and Ameerat. Oh So Fair was carrying the unborn Oh So Sharp in October 1981 when she was included in the deal in which Sheikh acquired the Dalham Hall stud. Oh So Sharp was sent into training at Henry Cecil's Warren Place stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was ridden in all of her races as a three- year-old by the American jockey Steve Cauthen. Lester Piggott had ridden Oh So Sharp during 1984, his last season as stable jockey at Warren Place. Racing career =1984: two-year-old season= Oh So Sharp made her racecourse debut in a six furlong maiden race at Nottingham Racecourse in August. Ridden by Pat Eddery she started the 1/2 favourite and won easily, despite being given a very gentle introduction by her jockey. In early September, Oh So Sharp was moved up in class and matched against colts in the Group Three Solario Stakes over seven furlongs at Sandown Park. Ridden on this occasion by the veteran Lester Piggott took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew clear to win by two lengths at odds of 6/4. The form of the race was boosted when the runner-up, Young Runaway, won the Group Two Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse two weeks later. Oh So Sharp's last race of the year was the Hoover Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse in which she started at odds of 6/5. The contest was then a Group Three race, but has subsequently been promoted to Group One. The filly raced in second place before taking the lead at the start of straight and won by one and a half lengths from the Prix du Calvados winner Helen Street, who was carrying four pounds more than the winner. In the International Classification produced by the official handicappers of France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, Oh So Sharp was given a rating of 77, five pounds behind the year's highest-rated two-year-old filly Triptych. =1985: three-year-old season= Spring Oh So Sharp began her three-year-old season on 18 April in the seven furlong Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in which she met Helen Street at level weights and was ridden for the first time by Cauthen. She won at odds of 8/13, beating Bella Colora by a length, with Helen Street two and a half lengths back in third. Two weeks later, Oh So Sharp was one of seventeen fillies to contest the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. Racing on unusually firm ground, Oh So Sharp was not among the early leaders and appeared to be struggling in the final quarter mile when the race seemed to lie between Bella Colora and Al Bahathri. In the closing stages however Cauthen produced the favourite with a powerful late run and she caught the leaders in the last stride to win a three-way photo finish by two short heads from Al Bahathri and Bella Colora. The runner-up, owned by Sheikh Mohammed's older brother Hamdan Al-Maktoum went on to win the Irish 1000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes while Bella Colora won the Prix de l'Op√©ra in autumn. Oh So Sharp's win gave Sheikh Mohammed a first win in a British Classic and her winning time of 1:36.85 broke the race record which had stood since 1950. Summer On 8 June, Oh So Sharp was moved up in distance for the Oaks (known for sponsorship reasons as the Gold Seal Oaks) at Epsom Downs Racecourse. In this race, which was run on soft ground, she was matched against Triptych who had run poorly in the 1000 Guineas but had then defeated a field of colts in the Irish 2000 Guineas. Cauthen settled the 6/4 favourite behind the leaders and tracked across to the stands side (furthest away from the inside rail) to take advantage of a strip of better ground. Oh So Sharp overtook Triptych two furlongs from the finish and quickly went clear, increasing her advantage throughout the closing stages to win by six lengths. Her win completed a notable double for Cecil and Cauthen, who had won The Derby with Slip Anchor over the same course and distance three days earlier. Cecil said he would \\"do his damnedest\\" to keep the pair apart in future races. Timeform rated her performance as the fourth- best seen in the Oaks up to that time, behind those of Petite Etoile, Noblesse, and Dunfermline. Now unbeaten in six races, Oh So Sharp ran against older horses for the first time in Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on 27 July. She started 4/5 favourites in a field of twelve, with her main rivals in the betting being Rainbow Quest, Strawberry Road, Petoski, and the Irish Derby winner Law Society. Oh So Sharp took the lead early in the straight and got the better of a prolonged struggle with the four-year-old Rainbow Quest but was caught in the closing stages and beaten a neck by Petoski. Oh So Sharp was brought back in distance to contest the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at York on 20 August. Triptych was again among her opponents, along with the leading four-year-olds Commanche Run and Palace Music, but Oh So Sharp was sent off the 2/5 favourite. Piggott set an unexpectedly slow pace on Commanche Run before accelerating early in the straight. Oh So Sharp chased the leader throughout the closing stages but never drew level and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length. Autumn Oh So Sharp ended her racing career in the St Leger on the 14 September when she was opposed by five colts in the 209th running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs. As she had already won the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks she was attempting to complete the fillies' version of the Triple Crown a feat which had last been achieved by Meld in 1955. She started the 8/11 favourite with her closest rival in the betting being her stable companion Lanfranco, winner of the William Hill Futurity and the King Edward VII Stakes. Oh So Sharp moved past Lanfranco in the straight but was unable to draw away from the colt and quickly came under renewed pressure from her stable companion and from the outsider Phardante. Oh So Sharp hung to the right in the closing stages before winning by three-quarters of a length and a head from Phardante and Lanfranco. The racecourse stewards called an inquiry into possible interference caused by the winner but the result was allowed to stand. Cecil admitted that the filly's form had been declining and said that \\"another week and it might have been too late\\". Assessment Oh So Sharp was given a rating of 131 by the independent Timeform organisation in 1985, making her the highest-rated three- year-old filly of the year. In the official International classification for 1985 she was the top rated filly of her generation by a margin of six pounds. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system John Randall and Tony Morris rated Oh So Sharp a \\"superior\\" Oaks winner and an \\"average\\" winner of the St Leger. They placed her twenty- eighth in their list of the best female racehorses trained in Britain and Ireland in the 20th century. Steve Cauthen called her, \\"without doubt, the best filly I have ridden.\\" Stud record Although reports suggested that Oh So Sharp was to be kept in training as a four-year-old she was retired from racing at the end of 1985 to become a broodmare at the Dalham Hall stud. None of her progeny have been as successful on the track as she was, but she has produced winners in Rosefinch, who won the Prix Saint-Alary, Shaima (USA) (1988, by Shareef Dancer) (Long Island Handicap), Sacho (IRE) (1993, by Sadler's Wells) and Felitza. Shaima, sired by Shareef Dancer, went on to produce the St Leger winner Shantou. Oh So Sharp is dam of Savoire Vivre who is enjoying some success at stud in Tasmania, Australia. In early 2001, Oh So Sharp began to suffer from laminitis. Her condition deteriorated in the autumn and she was euthanised at the end of October at the age of nineteen.

The village Kotla Mubarakpur dominates Bainsla gotra of Gurjars in India. Classified by the Delhi Development Authority (D.D.A.) as an Urban Village, it is situated within touch of South Extension-I. Its main road connected opposite with Defence Colony. Nearest Delhi Metro station is South Extension, INA metro station and Lajpat Nagar. Its history can be traced to the prominent tomb of Muizud Din Mubarak Shah, son of Khizr Khan of the Sayyid dynasty of the fifteenth century Delhi Sultanate rule in India, and its adjoining mosque. There are several other tombs of Lodi Dynasty period such as the Darya Khan's tomb, Kale Khan ka Gumbad, Bare Khan ka Gumbad, Chote Khan Ka Gumbad and Bhure Khan ka Gumbad, and also a Baoli (step well). Khizr Khan who was the governor of Punjab under the Lodi dynasty took over the reins at Delhi, in 1414 AD, after defeating Daulat Khan Lodi. He established the Sayyid dynasty, which had four successors till 1451 AD. His son Muizud Din Mubarak Shah succeeded him. He established a city called Mubarakabad on the banks of the Yamuna River, but no trace of it exists now. He died in 1434 AD and he was buried in Kotla Mubarakpur, named after him. His tomb was built in a fusion of Lodi style octagonal plan combined with Tughlaq style buttresses and wide dome. History Subsequent to the death of Muhammad bin Tughlaq of the Tughlaq Dynasty, in 1413 AD, the succession of power rested with Daulat Khan Lodi of the Lodi dynasty. But Khizr Khan who was the Governor of Punjab during the Lodi period, usurped power on 28 May 1414, and imprisoned Daulat Khan. He then went on to establish the Sayyid dynasty rule of the Delhi sultanate (1414‚Äì1451), who claimed to be descendants of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad; there were three other rulers of this dynasty who followed him. Khizr Khan, who founded the Sayyid dynasty, traced his ancestry to Mohammed based on a casual recognition of this claim by the famous saint Sayyid Jalal-ud-din of Bukhara. He was the viceroy of Shah Rukh, the fourth son of Timur lane. He was content with the title of Raydt-i-A'la, or 'the Exalted Standards' conferred on him. He was not only successful in uniting Punjab with Delhi and but was also able to tame the governors of several fiefdoms such as Mewat, Gwalior, Etawah and many more under his reign. During one of his campaigns, he fell seriously sick and returned to Delhi and before he died on 20 May 1421 AD, authorized the reins of power to his son Mubarak Khan. Mubarak Khan had no pretensions to assuming the title of Shah and declaring complete independence of his territory. He effectively and ruthlessly quelled the rebellious fiefdoms. He assumed the name of Muizz-ud-Din Mubarak Shah and minted coins in his name. He had adopted the practice of invading his fiefdoms to collect revenue for his coffers with effective coercion tactics. But his war campaigns had several set backs too. In the meanwhile there was a coterie of people surrounding him who were conspiring against him. In November 1442 AD, he established his new city called the Mubarakabad on the banks of the Yamuna River. After this, while returning from one of his successful war campaigns from Bhatinda in Punjab, he visited Mubarakabad, his new capital. On 14 February 1443 AD one of his disgruntled former Minister Sarvar-ul-Mulk, in association with other Hindu courtiers cleverly plotted to kill him. They were successful in brutally assassinating Mubarak Shah while he was preparing for his prayers. Since Mubarak did not have a son, Muhammad Shah, the son of his brother Farid was enthroned. A detailed account of Mubarak Shah's reign is available in the Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi written by Yahya-bin-Ahmad Sirhindi. After the death of Mubarak Khan Shah, his nephew Muhammad Khan ascended the throne and styled himself as Sultan Muhammad Shah. Just before his death, Muhammad Shah called his son Ala-ud-Din from Badaun and nominated him as his successor. But both these rulers proved ineffective in providing a viable rule and in fact the last ruler of this dynasty, Ala-ud-Din Alam Shah voluntarily abdicated the throne of the Delhi sultanate in favour of Bahlul Khan Lodhi on 19 April 1451 who was then ruler of Punjab and left for Badaun. He continued to live there till his death in 1478 AD. Bahlul Khan Lodhi then went on to establish the last dynasty of the Delhi sultanate.Mahajan, V.D. (1991, reprint 2007). History of Medieval India, Part I, New Delhi: S. Chand, , p.237Mahajan p.244 The rulers of the Sayyid dynasty subsisted their rule by collecting revenue by coercion. They could barely counter the pressure from the Sharqƒ´ sultans to the east and the Khokars to the northwest. Mubarak Shah's tomb Mubarak Shah's tomb is an impressive structure, which was built with an octagonal plan, enclosed in an octagonal compound with south and west gates exist while the compound walls and other gates have disappeared. The Sultan personally planned its construction during his lifetime. It has a southern entrance into the octagonal hall, which has arched openings on three sides, except in the west, which has the Mihrab, in the prayer direction.Sharma p.87 The tombs of Mubarak Shah and Muhammad Shah are strikingly similar, although built ten years apart and in different locations. It is quite possible that both monuments were built by the same architect. One major difference lies in the different heights of the dome in proportion to the rest of the building. Mubarak's tomb has a dome 4 feet lower than that of Muhammad, and it makes the dome out of proportion with the rest of the building. Thus, Mubarak's dome is too small for the size of the drum and the base of the verandah, and too flat to be attractive.Bhalla, A.S. Royal Tombs of India: 13th to 18th Century A verandah, with three entrances, encloses the hall. The hall and the verandah are provided with supporting sloping buttresses at the corners. A sixteen sided fortification, with turrets in each corner, supports the low dome structure. The turrets are crowned by a lantern. Chattris (kiosks) in octagonal shape adorn the roof on each side. Three tiers of Quranic inscriptions adorn the springing of the ceiling of the dome. Though stunted in appearance, it is considered as a typical example of octagonal Sayyid tombs, which were popular during Lodi and Mughal periods. The overall effect of the tomb is of a pyramidal appearance. Adjoining the tomb, there is a \\"funerary mosque\\" meant as a venue for prayers, and making public addresses by the visitors to the tomb. The mosque is located on the west wall of the tomb. It has two bays depth wise and five bays width wise and is decorated with arches supported on pillars (see image). Kotla Mubarakpur mosque Other tombs In the precincts of the Kotla Mubarakpur tomb and mosque, there are many other tombs of the Lodi period. These are (see gallery): Daryakhan's tomb ;Darya Khan's tomb Darya Khan Lohani's tomb is dated to the early 16th century. Darya Khan was the Chief Justice during the reign of Bahlol Lodi and vakil (advocate) during Sikander Lodi's rule. Considered an unusual tomb, most of the structure is in ruins. It has a commemorative circular platform structure built amidst a larger platform. Chaatris (kiosks) are seen at the corners. It has been deduced that when built the tomb had an impressive layout with a beautiful view.Sharma p.85 Tombs of Bade Khan and Chote Khan ; Bade Khan ka gumbad This is an impressive tomb monument with an intricate frontage. The central bay of the tomb is flanked by three rows of three niches. The central niche in each row is larger than the other two. Another unusual depiction for a Lodi period tomb is of the octagonal shaped turrets at the four corners. Chattris (12 pillared) adorn the top of the four turrets. The interior of the domed Chatris have ornamentation with incised and painted plaster bands with a decorative medallion in the centre. It is spread over an area of .Sharma p.86 ;Chote Khan ka gumbad This tomb considered to be built in \\"classic proportions\\" is located next to the Bade Khan's tomb, which has a wonderful well maintained interior. The exterior walls of the tomb, particularly at the entry, has carved plasterwork. ;Kale Khan ka gumbad This tomb is dated to 1481 AD as per an inscription on the Mihrab inside the tomb. Kale Khan was a courtier in the Lodi period during the reign of Bahlol Lodi. It is conjectured that his father was Darya Khan Lohani. There is a tall cenotaph in an otherwise usual Lodi type tomb. Its location is north of the Ring Road. It is stated to be the earliest dated tomb of the Lodi period. Visitor information Kotla Mubarakapur and South Extension are busy upscale city centres easily approachable by road, rail and air communications. The main artery, Ring Road of Delhi, passes through the place. The nearest railway stations are New Delhi Railway Station and Nizamuddin Railway Station, and away respectively.

It allows users to play offline or online via the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS). PyChess also incorporates a built-in chess engine, which in contrast to most other chess AIs is written in the Python language and focuses more on fun of play than raw strength. For more advanced users, PyChess allows for virtually any other external chess engine to be used with it.  History  Development on PyChess was started by Thomas Dybdahl Ahle in 2006, and the first public release was sent out later that year. The release contained the bare minimum of features to play a game of chess, and was backed only by the GNU Chess engine. In the end of 2006, PyChess was close to become a part of GNOME Games, which were holding a usage survey of aspiring new games to include in the suite. Being nearly just started at the time, it lost to the more established glChess, which managed to fix its hardware accelerating dependency before the end of the trial. glChess is still developed as a part of GNOME today. Afterwards there were talks of the two programs merging, but the developers decided they were targeting different user segments, with PyChess aiming towards more advanced users. In 2009 PyChess won Les Troph√©es du Libre in Paris in the category of hobby computing. PyChess has grown steadily since then, with increasing year-to-year development activity, and would cost more than $500,000 to develop today in terms of the man-hours required to develop such a codebase. By 2011 it was among the seven most frequently used chess clients to access the Free Internet Chess Server, which in turn is the only non-web-based chess server available for Linux. Version 0.12 of PyChess uses PyGObject and GTK+ 3, prior versions used the obsoleted PyGTK.  Logo  The current PyChess logo was contributed by Karol Kre≈Ñski in 2007. Karol's original design was very cartoonish, but was modified into a slightly calmer expression.  Aims  According to the PyChess website: The PyChess project puts heavy emphasis on simplicity, trying to avoid the complicated user interfaces of XBoard and BabasChess. This implies adding new features slowly, so they can be integrated in the overall usage scheme, and make things \\"just work\\". At the same time the project strives to contain most of the features known from major Windows chess clients such as Chessbase and Aquarium by ChessOK.

Tourism in Senegal is a vital part of the West African nation's economy. Scale From a relatively small industry at the introduction of the first Club Med resort in the 1970s, tourism has grown to be an important part of the Senegalese economy. Since the 1990s, Senegal has made an effort to reach beyond visitors from the former colonial power France and is attracting tourists from Spain, Britain and Italy, in part motivated by the example of neighbouring Gambia, which draws a relatively larger tourist share from Northern Europe and the Americas to its Banjul coastal resorts.Senegal's fading tourism dreams. Julian Bedford, BBC World Service. 13 March 2009 In 2008, Senegal's foreign tourist visitors had reached 1 million, attracted to luxury beach resorts, natural and historic sites. The return rate for visitors stood at around 30% in 2008. Future projections and bookings announced in 2009 raised fears that the global economic downturn would deal a blow to 2009 and 2010 tourist visits, with a booking rate down from 30% the year before to 5%. Attractions U.S. tourists - often African-Americans - are increasing in numbers, drawn in particular by the historic slave trading post of Goree Island.Senegal Country Commercial Guide 2008 . U.S. Commercial Service (2008). Principal cities of interest include the capital, Dakar; Saint-Louis, an old colonial town; and the Mouride holy centre of Touba. Gor√©e Island, formerly a centre of the West African slave trade and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, draws many visitors. Most tourists from outside Africa are Europeans, especially French, and a hotel and resort industry centered on enclosed beach resorts, most at resort towns like Saly on the Petite C√¥te south of Dakar, have been created to appeal to this clientele since the 1970s.Why Senegal is now on the winter sun map. Jill Crawshaw. The Observer (London), Sunday 14 December 2008 Resort vacations are often supplemented by wildlife and nature tours of areas like the Sine-Saloum Delta, the Grande C√¥te (north of Dakar), the Lac Rose, and Senegal River delta in the north (near Saint-Louis). Historic sites around Dakar, Gor√©e Island, Museums, and monuments draw visitors. To the north, the colonial island town of Saint-Louis is visited for its long history and colonial architecture. There are also safari trips offered to see wildlife, perhaps limited by east or South African standards. Senegal is considered to be one of the best places in the world to catch Sailfish. =National parks and reserves= Senegal has a small but developing National Park and Reserve System. Notable among these are the Langue de Barbarie National Park and Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary which provide wildlife habitat in the dunes and mangrove swamps surrounding the mouth of the Senegal River near city of Saint-Louis.Minist√®re de l‚ÄôEnvironnement, de la Protection de la nature, des Bassins de r√©tention et des Lacs artificiels: Parcs et r√©serves , 13 October 2005. The Niokolo-Koba National Park is a World Heritage Site and natural protected area in south eastern Senegal near the Guinea-Bissau border which protects a large variety of wild animals, including hippopotamuses, elephants, and lions. Largely undeveloped, the area is remote and lacks tourist infrastructure, but is a destination for specialty tours. The Basse Casamance National Park, in the far southwest, includes both ecotourism and tropical forest excursions, and a popular coastal beach resort aimed at foreign tourism. The Casamance conflict has hindered tourist development in this area. The Park has been closed now for a number of years due to rebel activity and mines. On attempting to enter the park (Jan 2019) via Emaye I was turned back by heavily armed army personnel, in no uncertain terms. The Saloum Delta National Park is a large area of mangrove estuaries and islands, visited by tourists for it wildlife, its cultural interest as the home of the minority Serer people, and its proximity to the tourist resorts of the Petite-C√¥te. Smaller parks and reserves, like the Guembeul Natural Reserve in the center west or the Bandia Natural Reserve near Dakar exit primarily for the more conventional European tourist industry, resembling Wildlife Parks or zoos. =African and Senegalese tourism= Senegal has a middle class prosperous enough to support local tourism, as well a large population of Senegalese living abroad. Apart from visits to family and friends, the city of Dakar supports a local industry of holiday spots frequented by city dwellers. The beaches and islands to the north of the city, at places like Yoff and Ngor, are particularly popular for Senegalese tourists.

Signature and blazon of Pieter Teyler. Pieter Teyler van der Hulst (25 March 1702 ‚Äì 8 April 1778) was a wealthy Dutch Mennonite merchant and banker, who died childless, leaving a legacy of two million florins (in today's terms: about EUR 80 million) to the pursuit of religion, arts and science in his hometown, that led to the formation of Teyler's Museum.Pieter Teyler's assets on Museum website. This was not the value of his entire estate. He also founded Teylers Hofje in his name, and made important donations to individuals in the Mennonite community. Biography Teylers Fundatiehuis. Until the Spaarne wing was built in 1885, access to Teylers Museum was gained through this door: the front door of Pieter Teyler's residence. Pieter Teyler van der Hulst was born on 25 March 1702 in Haarlem in the Dutch Republic. Teyler was an active follower of the Scottish Enlightenment, being descended from wealthy Scots merchants. His name is derived from the Scottish Tailor. He married the lady Helena Wynands Verschaave in 1728.Huuwlykszangen voor den heere Pieter Teyler, van der Hulst, en jongkvrouwe Helena Wynands Verschaave, poem by Pieter Langendijk on the occasion of their wedding in the DBNL He was an active member of the \\"Waterlander\\" mennonite community and became a trustee of the city orphanage from 1750 onwards.Teyler van der Hulst, Pieter (1702-1778) on Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online He made his wealth as a silk and cloth merchant, but from 1763 he became more and more active as a banker. He made loans to his Haarlem contemporaries, including to his fellow Scot and neighbor George Clifford III, the wealthy Amsterdam merchant known for sponsoring Carl Linnaeus. Scottish bankers such as Teyler, Clifford, and Hope & Co. were all patrons of the arts and sciences. Teyler was also active in the Haarlem Mennonite community with his wife, and together they founded a Mennonite hofje in the Teyler name in 1752.Haarlems hofjes, Dr. G. H. Kurtz, Schuyt & Co C.V., Haarlem, 1972, Unlike other Mennonite hofjes of Haarlem, however, it was not necessary for its residents to be Mennonites. In the 18th century, the ruling classes of Amsterdam (where Teyler had his banking offices) and Haarlem were all Protestants, as was the Dutch Stadtholder. Roman Catholics, Mennonites, Quakers, and others were unable to participate in organisations such as the Dutch Society of Science (Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen), which was started in Haarlem in 1752 with the purpose of pursuing science in all aspects. This society moved in 1831 across the Spaarne river from Teyler's Museum, and has had close ties with Teyler's legacy ever since. Pieter Teyler was influenced by the local Natural History College (Dutch: Natuurkundig College)(whose activities are mentioned in 1730) and the Dutch Society of Sciences. Other Mennonites and citizens of Haarlem who were interested in natural history were members of these institutions. With others, he was involved in the initiative to establish the City Drawing School (1772). By lending large sums of money, he also facilitated other initiatives, including new premises for the Dutch Society of Sciences (1777) and the establishment of a College of Music (1773). Collection Unfortunately, little is documented of the original collection of Pieter Teyler. When he died, he had a large collection of natural history artefacts, medals, drawings, and a large library. The early executors of his will seem to have sold some of it to create the Oval room, and much of the rest of it was mixed in with later purchases, but many aspects of his collection remain in the mission of the various aspects of the museum. Curators over the years have managed to reconstruct much of his coin collection, and many of the paintings he purchased for his home are still installed where they were intended. Legacy In his Will (written in 1756) Pieter Teyler stipulated that his collection and part of his fortune should be used to establish a foundation for their promotion: Teylers Stichting. The Teyler legacy to the city of Haarlem was split into two societies: Teylers First or Theological Society (Dutch: Teylers Eerste of Godgeleerd Genootschap), intended for the study of religion and Teylers Second Society (Dutch: Teylers Tweede Genootschap), which was to concern itself with physics, poetry, history, drawing and numismatics. The executors of Teyler's Will, the first directors of Teylers Stichting, decided to establish a centre for study and education: Teylers Museum. His former home in Haarlem with its entrance on the Damstraat is joined to the Teyler's Museum at the rear through a side door in the Oval room. Today his house is known as the \\"Fundatiehuis\\" and is open only by appointment and once a year on \\"Monumentendag\\".

Supporters of the national Democratic Party nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, left the party to support the national slate. In 1968 led by John L. Cashin, Jr., a dentist from Huntsville who had been active in the voter registration group the Alabama Democratic Conference, Democrats loyal to Humphrey and national Democratic Party formed the NDPA as a vehicle to field a slate of electors pledged to him and not to Wallace. Although national Democratic Party supported Humphrey, Wallace was put on ballot in his home state as official Democratic nominee. Also, in 1964, the Democratic Party of Alabama's electors were unpledged instead of being pledged to Lyndon Johnson, a moot point since Alabama voted in large numbers for Barry Goldwater. There were precedent for the behavior of the state party machinery such as when Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond was the Democratic nominee in 1948 in some southern states despite Harry S. Truman being the Democratic nominee. In 1960, Democrat John F. Kennedy was on the ballot, but the state was carried by a split slate in which most electors were unpledged, opting for Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd in the electoral college. In 1964, the Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson was not in ballot in Alabama, and an unpledged electors slate was officially nominated by Alabama's Democrats. At the time, Alabama listed all the electors on the ballot but not the Presidential candidate, so Democratic Presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey was supported by the National Democratic slate (whose most popular elector won 54144 votes) and an \\"Alabama Independent Democrat\\" slate (whose most popular elector won 142435 votes). Wallace was supported by the Democratic Party of Alabama and unaffiliated American Independent electors (they were unaffiliated since the totals of different electors couldn't be added together). In the election for the US Senate, Democratic candidate Jim Allen won 638,774 votes, to 201,227 votes for Republican Perry Hooper and 72,699 votes for National Democrat Robert P. Schwenn. Wallace garnered 65.86% of the Alabama vote, with Humphrey coming second with 18.72%.Our Campaigns - AL US President Race - Nov 05, 1968 Post 1968 activity During the Alabama gubernatorial election, 1970, John Cashin ran as the NDPA candidate for governor against George Wallace,Huntsville Madison County Public Library : Item Viewer getting 15% of the vote.National Democratic Party of Alabama, Encyclopedia of Alabama Wallace was easily re- elected with 637,046 (74.51%) votes against Cashin who won only 125,491 (14.68%).

At Roa Station, the line connects to the Gj√∏vik Line, while at H√∏nefoss Station, it connects to the Randsfjorden Line and the Bergen Line. The line runs through Innlandet and Viken counties and allowed the Bergen Line access to Oslo at Oslo East Station. The Line was built by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and opened on 1 December 1909, along with the last part of the Bergen Line. The line was electrified in 1961. Until 1989, nearly all Oslo‚ÄìBergen trains used the line to terminate at Oslo East Station. It was also possible to reach Oslo from H√∏nefoss via the Randsfjord Line, albeit terminating at Oslo West Station. NSB also ran a local service between H√∏nefoss and Oslo along the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line. Oslo‚ÄìBergen trains ran via the Randsfjord Line after 1989 and local train services have been terminated. However, the line remains in use for freight trains along the Oslo‚ÄìBergen route. Route H√∏nefoss Station, the western terminus of the Roa-H√∏nefoss Line The line starts at Roa Station, which is also located on the Gj√∏vik Line and is from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S).Aspenberg (1999): 70 Located at above mean sea level, Roa has the highest elevation on the whole line. The line runs first west, then south to Jevnaker Station, passing Kalvsj√∏ Station, Grindvoll Station, Gunstad Station, Bjellum Tunnel and Kvellsrud Station, before reaching Jevnaker, which is from Roa.Bjerke (1994): 123 For a long time, Jevnaker had two separate stations located at each end of the town, with the other station serving as the terminus of the Randsfjord Line.Aspenberg (1999): 74 The line then runs south-west, past Bergerfoss and Kistefoss, before reaching Viul. There, there is a branch to a lumber mill. After Viul, the line runs through two tunnels, long. At Hval, located from Roa, there was formerly a spur to a military camp. The line then runs over a bridge over Randselva before passing H√∏nen and a spur at H√∏nen and to a Goman bakery. Just before reaching H√∏nefoss Station, the line runs on a bridge over Begna. At H√∏nefoss, the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line and the Randsfjord Line come in from the east while the Randsfjord Line and the Bergen Line continue to the west. H√∏nefoss is from Oslo via Roa and via Drammen. History Grindvoll Station Jevnaker Station The bridge over Begna, next to H√∏nefoss Station H√∏nefoss Station opened on 13 October 1868 as an intermediate station on the Randsfjord Line which connects Randsfjorden to Drammen. The initial proposals for the Bergen Line route went from H√∏nefoss via Sandvika to Oslo West Station (Oslo V). However, this was met with a combination of political opposition and technical restrictions. During the 1880s and 1890s, all lines that did not connect to Sweden were to be built with narrow gauge. The Drammen Line, which connected Sandvika to Oslo, was narrow gauge, as were the rest of the lines west of Oslo.Bergh (2004): 191‚Äì95, 256‚Äì57 During the planning of the Gj√∏vik Line (at the time known as the North Line), military considerations eventually led to the decision to build it with standard gauge. Eventually it was decided that the Bergen Line would also be built with standard gauge. However, to reach Oslo from H√∏nefoss, a longer route to connect to the Gj√∏vik Line would have to be built, allowing the line to connect to the more important Oslo East Station. The construction of the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line and the Bergen Line from H√∏nefoss to Taugevatn was passed by the Parliament of Norway on 2 June 1898.Aspenberg (1999): 19 The line was built by NSB as part of the Bergen Line project, for which construction across the mountain had commenced in 1895.Aspenberg (1999): 20 Construction of the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line started in 1903.Aspenberg (1999): 21 This section is relatively flat and was the easiest part of the project to build. The line was officially opened along with the section of the Bergen Line from Gulsvik to H√∏nefoss, by King Haakon VII on 27 November 1909. It was taken into ordinary use on 1 December.Bjerke (1994): 11 At the time the line opened, there were stations at Roa, Grindvoll, Jevnaker, Hval and H√∏nefoss. To begin with, the line had a single through train from Oslo to Bergen, with an additional summer express‚Äîwith a limited number of stops. In addition, there were two additional trains from H√∏nefoss to Oslo.Aspenberg (1999): 34 From 1 May 1912, a night train was also introduced and the same year mixed passenger and freight trains were introduced from √Öl on the Bergen Line to Oslo.Aspenberg (1999): 35 A station was opened at Viul on 16 August 1915, and another at Kistefoss on 1 October. Because of economic impact of World War I, the night train services was reduced to only twice a week from 20 May 1917 until 7 June 1919.Aspenberg (1999): 36 In 1930, new stations were established at Kalvsj√∏, Gunstad, Bergerfoss and H√∏nen. During World War II from 1940 to 1945, the frequency was reduced to no more than one train per day. During parts of 1940, the Oslo‚ÄìBergen line was instead run via the Drammen and Randsfjord Lines. However, two local trains were kept on the route from H√∏nefoss to Roa.Aspenberg (1999): 38 From 18 November 1945, the daily Oslo‚ÄìBergen trains again ran via Roa, while the local trains from Oslo to H√∏nefoss increased to three daily round trips. Three weekly night trains were introduced from 1946. From 2 January to 1 May 1947, there was four weekly express services from Oslo to Geilo on the Bergen Line.Aspenberg (1999): 57 By 1950, the situation had normalized and there were daily day and night trains and three weekly express trains‚Äîthe latter with no stops between H√∏nefoss and Oslo.Aspenberg (1999): 58 Kvellsrud Station opened on 18 August 1952. In the 1930s, it was decided that the Bergen Line was to be electrified. After the first section, from Bergen to Voss, was completed in 1954, the Gj√∏vik Line and the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line were the next to be electrified. The sections Oslo‚ÄìJaren and Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss opened with electric traction on 1 February 1961.Aspenberg (1999): 51 Automatic signaling was put into service on 10 December 1973 and automatic train stop was put into operation on 27 October 1987.Bjerke (1994): 122 From 3 June 1984, the day train was moved to run via Drammen.Aspenberg (1999): 66 Until 1989, the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line had four daily round trips with a local train from H√∏nefoss via Roa to Oslo, normally a Class 65 or Class 67 unit. From 1989, this was reduced to a single round trip, with a morning train from H√∏nefoss to Oslo and a return in the afternoon. Eventually this was taken over by a Class 69 unit and by the late 1990s taken out of service. The Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line remains a pure freight track for long-haul freight trains on the Bergen Line. After the opening of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station in 1989, passenger trains run via Drammen; however, the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line is used as a reserve line for passenger trains when the Drammen Line or Randsfjord Line is out of service.

Cheenu took to painting at very early age, thanks to his elder brother who was artist himself. Brought up in a pious background, portraits of gods used to be his favorite theme. At that age, his rendering of the religious images fulfilled purely a spiritual need. But as he delved more into the forms, the symmetry and balance in the Hindu iconography captured his imagination.

This Latin phrase is a translation of the original Greek manuscripts of the Bible. The most reliable Greek manuscripts cite \\"·ø•ŒØŒ∂Œ± Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œ∫·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºêœÉœÑŒπŒΩ ·º° œÜŒπŒªŒ±œÅŒ≥œÖœÅŒØŒ± (1Ti 6:10 BGT)\\". This is literally translated into English, \\"Root for all the evil is the love of money.\\" Daniel Wallace states that ·ø•ŒØŒ∂Œ± (root) is qualitative, since it lacks an article. A more idiomatic understanding of this phrase is, \\"For every possible kind of evil can be motivated by the love of money.\\" Meaning, greed can lead to any number of different kind of evils, not that all evil is rooted in the love of money. The original biblical quotation means \\"the love of money is the root of all evil\\" (or all kinds of evil), and has been translated into English as such since the King James Version. It has frequently been rendered as \\"money is the root of all evil\\". Song by the Andrews Sisters. The original source is 1 Timothy 6:10 (St Jerome's Vulgate translation). The word cupiditas is ambiguous, as it may also mean cupidity, or strong desire. The Latin phrase is itself a translation from Greek, where the original word philarguria can only mean love of money. In the medieval poet Geoffrey Chaucer's Pardoner's Tale in The Canterbury Tales, this lesson was illustrated. However, because of the Pardoner's dubious character, the Latin saying has ironic connotations. The Modern English word cupidity is described by OED as etymologically cognate with Latin cupidus, grammatically feminine, Eagerly Desirous. There can be no ambiguity nor misunderstanding of the force of the word as used by Catullus:Wikiquote:Gaius Valerius Catullus Sed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti In vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua The OED definition of cupidity is Ardent desire, inordinate longing or lust; covetousness, placing the weight firmly on the lecherous side of the reference of this word, which came into our language from Latin, and perhaps through French. That its biblical reference is to the desire of filthy lucre seems established, but to the Latin-literate medieval people, the other cultural reference, to the desires of the flesh, would have suggested an alternative meaning.

The models for the virtual reality world Techuelife Island were created using Seamless3d technology. Techuelife Island is showcased by Blaxxun as an example of what is possible when using the interactive multi-user Blaxxun platform. Many Seamless3d tutorials have been translated to French. History In 2001 Seamless3d was made freely available online as a C++ library. The library centered on the creation of animated single mesh avatars for the Blaxxun 3d multi-user platform. It allowed the user to create smooth shaped triangle meshes and join different meshes together with tangent matching surfaces at the joining edges using a C++ compiler. By February 2003 Seamless3d had been transformed into a GUI based 3d modelling application with a file format designed around VRML format. This allowed Seamless3d files to be edited using VrmlPad utilising its syntax checking. In 2005 a script compiler was developed and in May 2006 Seamless3d was able to act as a web browser for seamless3d files containing complex scripted animations. In 2006 a set of specialised nodes for creating simple shapes such as: Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Torus, Box and B√©zier Lathe were added to make Seamless3d easier for the novice to quickly make simple models. In 2007 the animation interface was greatly simplified by the introduction of a specialised control panel called the Anim bar. Towards the end of 2007 NURBS were introduced for making shapes and for synthesizing sounds. In 2010 NURBS control point animation, NURBS stitching and a number of other features to aid making movies were introduced. Build Node Technology Seamless3d can be used as a mesh editor and an animator, however its key feature is its build node technology. Build nodes allow the user to perform a sequence of complex operations in real time whenever a control point in the 3d window is dragged. NURBS Surface Poly Editing (NSPE) NSPE NSPE allows the user to hand edit the polygons on NURBS surfaces. This includes being able to drag the vertices anywhere along the NURBS surface as well as join the vertices together, break the vertices apart and color them. NSPE has a significant advantage over simply converting a NURBS surface to a polygon mesh for editing because NSPE lets the user be able continue to modify the NURBS surface for the hand edited polygon structure. Because NSPE ensures that when a polygon's vertex is dragged it will always be on the NURBS surface, NSPE greatly helps the user to avoid unintentionally changing the shape of the model when optimizing for real time animation. Fusing NURBS Surfaces Fusing NURBS surfaces By including a FuseSurface feature designed for fusing 2 NURBS surfaces together, Seamless3d allows for the creation of smooth continuous curvy models made from multiple NURBS surfaces. SeamlessScript Seamless3d has its own built in script compiler which compiles SeamlessScript (a very fast light weight scripting language) into native machine code. SeamlessScript is designed to look and feel a lot like JavaScript while being able to be compiled by a standard C++ compiler. This allows the user to develop complex animation sequences using a C++ IDE which gives the user access to professional debugging aids such as single step execution. Seamless3d format Seamless3d format (smls) is a text-based human readable format with some aspects common to VRML. The following example shows the code (containing SeamlessScript) for an animated spinning box: #SMLS V2.127 utf8 Seamless{ effect ColorEffect{} skeleton DEF part Part{} build BoxBuild{ part USE part } } Anim{ play TRUE pause FALSE loop TRUE period 4 void onFrame(float v){ part.rotation = Rotation(0, 1, 0, PI * 2 * v); } } Seamless3d Chat The Multi-User Seamless3d chat server designed for 3D World Wide Web browsing is open source under the MIT license and can be compiled for both Linux and Windows. Currently the Seamless3d modeller is used as the 3D chat client. An online Seamless3d chat server has been in continuous service since April 2009.

Its SSSI designation is due to its importance for nature conservation, but it is also a Regionally Important Geological Site. The site is a steep hill, which is ancient woodland, although there are few very old trees because until the railways made cheap coal available, the timber was used for fuel. On the lower slopes there is a diverse community of plants dominated by oak and hazel on rich soils overlying chalk. Further up the trees are mainly beech on Thanet Sands, and towards the top the main trees are oak and birch on the acidic Blackheath pebble beds. The Thanet Sands have eroded, but the Blackheath beds are bound by a natural cement, and this has resisted erosion to make a natural cap to the hill. The top is mainly bare of trees, with rounded pebbles made when the area was the base of shallow seas in the Eocene epoch around 50 million years ago. The sparse vegetation at the top is mainly wavy hair-grass, heather and bilberry.Natural England, Greater London History Croham Hurst round barrow (marker stone) Its human occupation goes back thousands of years. In 1968 two hut sites were discovered with low turf walls, which were part of a Mesolithic settlement around 5,000 to 3,000 years BC. Neolithic flint tools show that settlement continued into the later Stone Age. There is also a Bronze Age round barrow, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, with a plaque marking the site. In the medieval period Croham was one of the four manors in the parish of Sanderstead. In the late sixteenth century its then owner, Sir Olliphe Leigh of Addington, sold it to John Whitgift, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Croham Hurst then became part of his Whitgift Foundation, an educational and nursing charity which is still operating today. In the late nineteenth century Croham Hurst became a popular spot for visitors, few of whom knew that it was not public property. When the Foundation announced plans to sell the site in 1898, with the lower slopes being developed, the people of Croydon launched a campaign to save the site, which resulted in the whole of it being acquired by Croydon Corporation on 8 February 1901. It became part of the London Borough of Croydon in 1965. The site was badly damaged by fire in June 2018.https://insidecroydon.com/2018/07/01/large-sections-of-croham-hurst- left-scarred-after-day-long-fires/ Access There is access from Croham Manor Road, Bankside and Upper Selsdon Road.

Television genres  = Telenovelas = Lucero recognized by People en Espa√±ol as the \\"Queen of the Telenovelas\\" celebrated on the 2013 issue of \\"Los 50 mas Bellos\\". Lucero has won more TVyNovelas Awards than any other actress. Mexico is one of the first countries in the world to be known for producing telenovelas aimed at shaping national social behavior ‚Äì one issue of which is on family planning during the 1970s. The Mexican model of telenovelas (soap opera) ‚Äì then to be replicated by other telenovela-producing countries in Latin America and Asia for most of the 1990s ‚Äì usually involves a romantic couple that encounters many problems throughout the show's run, a villain and usually ends with a wedding. One common ending archetype, consists of a wedding, and with the villain dying, going to jail, becoming permanently injured or disabled, or losing his/her mind. The use of sexually themed episodes starring the leading couple of the story has been a common element through most Mexican (and even Latin American) telenovelas. Senda prohibida is the first telenovela produced in Mexico. It was produced by Telesistema Mexicano and broadcast June 12, 1958, from Monday to Friday. Museum display, homage to writer Yolanda Vargas Dulch√© at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. Museum visitor looks at a mock set representing the telenovela Gabriel y Gabriela. Televisa and TV Azteca are the largest producers and exporters of Mexican telenovelas. Their main competitor is independent company Argos Comunicaci√≥n. Telenovelas produced by U.S.-based network Telemundo tend to follow the Mexican model. Previously, telenovelas were often thought to be used as a government tool to distract citizens from national issues, a reason cited for temporary decrease in their credibility and popular appeal. Nowadays, Mexican television has managed to counteract government influence in its telenovelas. In particular, around 1990, Televisa found an enormous market for its telenovelas in regions such as Brazil and parts of Latin America, post-Cold War Eastern Europe and Asia. This precipitated the so-called 'Telenovela Craze'. Credited by media experts especially to Televisa's move in the early 1990s of exporting its telenovelas to parts of the world, this rivaled the wave of American sitcoms that had been broadcast worldwide in the same period. Fernando Colunga is one of the most awarded actors. During the peak of the global success of Latin American telenovelas in the 1990s and 2000s, several prominent Mexican actors and actresses gained huge following for the telenovelas that they starred and which were viewed in the mentioned regions. For example, Ver√≥nica Castro's international fame grew when the novela she had starred in many years earlier, Los Ricos Tambien Lloran in 1979, became a major hit in Russia. In the 1982 telenovela Vanessa, Luc√≠a M√©ndez became the first star of a soap-opera to be killed; however, this was due to her alleged diva attitude which forced retaliation from the writers and producers to \\"kill Vanessa off\\", later she stated that she was sick with pneumonia and that's the reason why she couldn't shoot the last scenes. In the same period, Thal√≠a earned the title as the 90's \\"Queen of Soap Operas\\" after starring in the so-called Las Tres Marias or the \\"Maria Trilogy\\" telenovelas ‚Äì Maria Mercedes, Marimar and Maria la del Barrio ‚Äì and Rosalinda, converting her into one of the world's foremost television icons, as her telenovelas were broadcast in Mexico and more than 180 other countries to almost 2 billion viewers worldwide, earning the all-time highest television ratings both in Mexico and other regions. Due to the international success of the telenovelas broadcast in and out of Mexico, by the late 1990s, the company claimed that telenovelas were Mexico's leading export product. Many consider the period from 1958 to 2004 to be Televisa's Golden Age of telenovelas, at the same time when the Mexican government loosened its control over television. Telenovelas, primarily those produced by Argos Comunicaci√≥n, consequently addressed new themes, including poverty, political corruption, immigration and drug smuggling. However, with American drama and comedy series becoming increasingly popular among Mexican audiences through cable or satellite television and unlicensed copying, the television companies opted to adapt stories from Argentina, Colombia and Brazil. These used veteran actors in order to decrease expenses. Currently, the most successful telenovelas are being created by Argos and Telemundo and are rebroadcast (or adapted) by the main companies. The most successful one, La Reina del Sur, based on the book by Arturo Perez Reverte, is based on the true story of a female drug trafficker in Sinaloa. Though it was censored somewhat due to the Drug War and was broadcast on a low-rated channel, it achieved higher viewership than other programs in the same timeframe. On November 21, 2016 Televisa released a telenovela titled La candidata (The Candidate) protagonized by actress Silvia Navarro as Regina B√°rcenas (whom acts as the speculated fictional stand-in for Margarita Zavala) and Rafael S√°nchez Navarro as her husband Alonso San Roman (which acts as the speculated fictional stand-in for Felipe Calderon). It is heavily speculated this television program, was created in order to favor Zavala in the 2018 elections against MORENA's political candidate Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador whom Televisa did not want as president due to his leftist political points of view. =Television Sitcoms= El Chavo del 8 was a Mexican comic television series created by and starring Chespirito. The program deals with the experiences of a group of people who live in a Mexican neighborhood where its protagonist, is a poor orphan nicknamed \\"El Chavo\\" (which means \\"The Kid\\"). At its peak of popularity during the mid-1970s, it had a Latin American audience of over 350 million viewers per episode. El Chapul√≠n Colorado ('The Red Grasshopper' or as Captain Hopper in the English version of the animated series) was olso a Mexican television comedy series that ran from 1973 to 1979 and parodied superhero shows. It was first aired by Televisa in 1973 in Mexico, and then was aired across Latin America and Spain until 1981, alongside El Chavo, which shared the same cast of actors. Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo worked in various successful television series, the most successful of which have been Dr. C√°ndido P√©rez, Cero en conducta, and its sequel, La escuelita VIP, and lastly Una familia de diez. Ortiz de Pinedo was featured in the 2007 book Televisa presenta (presents), which takes a look back at 50 years of network television in Mexico. He has worked as Mexican producer, director, writer, comedian and actor. Modern show include La familia P. Luche it features a dysfunctional family living in a city with a lot of plush fabric with plenty of terms related to family drama and general everyday life and Vecinos the series portrays the life of everyday people in Mexican barrios, where anything can be found ‚Äî the jealous housewife, the spinster, the strange family, etc. Each episode features the interactions between these peculiar neighbors, where they deal with problems both real and imagined, such as ghosts, treasures, ripoffs, fights, etc..  History  GonCam Camera of Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena for Chromoscopic adapter for television equipment, pioneer color system for broadcasting. Radio and TV Museum, Palacio de la Cultura y la Comunicaci√≥n, Zapopan, Jalisco. Television in Mexico first began on August 19, 1946 in Mexico City when Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena transmitted the first television signal in Latin America from the bathroom of his home. On September 7, 1946 at 8:30 PM (CST) Mexico‚Äôs and Latin America‚Äôs first experimental television station was established and was given the XE1GC callsign. This experimental station broadcast an artistic program and interviews on Saturdays for two years.Latin America's first experimental television station Mexico‚Äôs first commercial station, XHTV channel 4 in Mexico City, signed on August 31, 1950, making Mexico the first Spanish- speaking country to introduce television. It started transmitting regular programs on the following day. The first program to be broadcast was President Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s IV Informe de Gobierno.XHTV first television station in Latin America Within a year, XEW-TV channel 2, owned by the Azc√°rraga family, was formed. Mexico's first color television transmission was carried out by the third television station in the capital, Gonz√°lez Camarena's XHGC Canal 5. In 1955, all three stations formed an alliance, Telesistema Mexicano (TSM), the predecessor to Televisa. In 1959, XEIPN-TV channel 11 signed on, the base of today's Canal Once network and the first educational television station in Latin America. = Broadcast expansion = Interview with Lolita Ayala at the charity auction \\"Arte en Barricas\\" (Art in Barricas) sponsored by Tequila Herradura in Mexico City. With the exception of the short-lived but popular Televisi√≥n Independiente de M√©xico (1968‚Äì72), which TSM absorbed in 1973 to form Televisa, the latter saw no major commercial competition until 1993. Instead, the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s were marked by a large expansion in state-owned television. This took flight in 1972 when the government, through financier SOMEX, expropriated XHDF-TV in Mexico City and used it to form the base of a Canal 13 national network with repeaters across the country. At the same time, a project known as Televisi√≥n Rural de M√©xico (later Televisi√≥n de la Rep√∫blica Mexicana) sought to bring culture and information to rural Mexican audiences. In the 1980s, XHTRM-TV channel 22, the first UHF television station in the Valle de M√©xico, came to air bringing TRM programming to the nation's capital. In 1985, TRM was dismantled, and with the sign-on of XHIMT- TV channel 7 in Mexico City, the TRM repeaters were linked to that station, which became the flagship of the Red Nacional 7 of Imevisi√≥n. In 1993, Imevisi√≥n's privatization gave birth to Televisi√≥n Azteca. This time period also saw the development of the first television networks run by state governments, including TVM√ÅS in Veracruz and TeleMichoac√°n. 25 of Mexico's 32 federal entities currently boast state networks. = Cable television = Eiza Gonz√°lez debuted in her role as \\"Lola\\" in Lola...√ârase una vez. Then she started in cables El Rey Network From Dusk till Dawn: The Series. The first cable system started to operate in the early 1960s in Monterrey, as a CATV service (an antenna at the top of the Loma Larga, which could get TV signals from Laredo, Texas and the Rio Grande Valley). Most of the other major cities didn't develop cable systems until the late 1980s, due to government censorship. By 1989, the industry had had a major impulse with the founding of Multivisi√≥n‚Äîa MMDS system who started to develop its own channels in Spanish‚Äîand the later development of companies such as Cablem√°s and Megacable. Over the past few years, many US networks have started to develop content for the Latin American market, such as CNN en Espa√±ol, MTV, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, and others. The country also has a DTH service called SKY (Televisa & News Corp. owned). Recently DirecTV merged with Sky. The dominant company nowadays is Megacable and Grupo HEVI. = Digital television = Kate del Castillo starred in Ingobernable ( ungovernable), a Mexican political drama web television series that premiered on Netflix on 24 March 2017. Televisa made experimental HDTV broadcasts in the early 1990s, in collaboration with Japan's NHK. However, the digital television transition saw the government devise several switchover plans, none of which stuck. In 2004, the government adopted the same ATSC standard as the United States and sought to end analog television by December 31, 2016. In major markets, particularly in central Mexico and along the US border, digital television stations began to come on air. A revised plan in 2013 saw a change to switching off television markets separately until a national analog shutoff, set for December 31, 2015. The first market to meet the conditions of 90% digital penetration was Tijuana. After a one-month delay to ensure that digital penetration had crossed the 90% threshold, signals were turned off on May 28. However, Cofetel allowed the Tijuana stations to resume analog broadcasting just a few days later over concerns that the switchover would have a negative impact in the lead up to state elections on July 7; the switchover occurred for good on July 18. (Spanish) Delays continued due to legal concerns and the telecommunications reform of 2013‚Äì14 promulgated by President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, which required entirely new legislation in the sector and created the new Federal Telecommunications Institute. However, digital switchover got back on track in 2015 when Reynosa/Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo switched off on January 13, the first of ten dates that year on which stations in various regions of the country shut off. By December 31, all high- power stations had shut off, with some 500 low-power stations remaining in service for an additional year due to the financial difficulties encountered by public broadcasters in transitioning and the existence of unprepared repeater stations.

Full-power analog television broadcasts, however, were required by U.S. federal law to cease by June 12, 2009. Low-power, Class A, and TV Translator stations are not currently required to cease analog broadcasts. Also by law, digital broadcasts ‚Äî when transmitted as over-the-air signals ‚Äî must conform to ATSC standards.FCC. The Digital TV Transition FAQs it is unclear whether satellite operators are free to use their own proprietary standards; and many standards exist for Internet television (most are proprietary).  Standards  The U.S. opted to adhere to ATSC standards for broadcast digital television. These standards define, among other things, format and transmission criteria that ensure consistency, accessibility, and fairness for consumers and equipment manufacturers alike in the U.S., as well as international compatibility. = Format standards = The five main ATSC formats of DTV currently broadcast in the U.S. are: * Standard definition--480i, to maintain compatibility with existing NTSC sets when a digital television broadcast is converted back to an analog one--either by a converter box or a cable/satellite operator's proprietary equipment * Enhanced definition--480p, about the same quality as DVDs * High definition--720p * High definition--1080i * High definition--1080p (only used by a few cable operators, currently no terrestrial stations broadcast in 1080p) Most digital television sets sold in the U.S. use a display with a 16:9 aspect ratio to optimally display HDTV-formatted content. Lower-resolution sources like regular DVDs may be upscaled to the native resolution of the TV. = Transmission standards =  Pay television  Most Americans get digital television broadcasts via cable or satellite. Digital cable television systems with an active channel capacity of 750 MHz or greater, are required by the FCC to follow ANSI/SCTE transmission standards with the exception of cable systems that only pass through 8 VSB modulated signals. Digital television sets (equipped with ATSC tuners) are often capable of viewing a baseline set of unencrypted digital programming, known as basic cable or low-tier channels, which typically include local network television affiliates. According to FCC regulations, the remaining encrypted channels must be viewable with a receiver equipped with a CableCARD.  Terrestrial  Digital television transmissions over-the-air (OTA) are available in metropolitan areas in the U.S., often carrying both standard-definition and high-definition (HDTV) transmissions of the same stations. As of the analog shut-off date of June 12, 2009, all full power OTA stations in the U.S. by law either transmitted their broadcasts digitally, or shut down. Many stations used the switch to digital transmission as an opportunity to transition from 480i broadcasts to digital HD OTA broadcasts (either in 720p or 1080i), though this change is voluntary. Within a distance of 35 to 40 miles from the broadcast stations, it is possible that a simple antenna (such as \\"rabbit ears\\") may be adequate to receive a DTV broadcast signal OTA‚Äîat least some of the time for some of the channels. Any television equipped with an ATSC tuner may display DTV broadcasts properly. Some customers discovered that terrain, trees, rain, snow, wind, and movement of people around the room interfere with reception to one degree or another, from signals breaking up to total loss of signal. (Few modern ATSC-equipped televisions or converter boxes have internal antennas, in contrast to analog sets available in years past). Broadcast TV signals in the United States are horizontally polarized.  Transition from analog to digital terrestrial broadcasts in 2009  It was estimated that as of April 2007, 28% of American households had an HDTV set, a total of 35 million sets, and that 86% of owners were highly satisfied with the HDTV programming All TV stations currently broadcast in both digital and analog and major networks broadcast in HD in most markets. While many in the industry wanted a flexible or delayed deadline, the FCC forced the issue at the behest of Congress. Congress wanted to reclaim some of the spectrum used for analog and repurpose that for emergency services. They also wanted to auction off bandwidth between 76-88 MHz frequencies (channels 5 and 6) and old analog UHF channels 60 to 69, and channels 52 to 59 by mandating DTV tuners be phased into all new TV sets. Many transition dates were proposed, but Congress finally fixed February 17, 2009 (later extending it until June 12, 2009), in law as the maximum end date for analog television authorizations. as amended by section 3002 of Because this date comes after the NCAA's Bowl Championship Series and the NFL's Super Bowl XLIII, there will be less of a chance of an acute hardware shortage from people waiting until the last minute to purchase an ATSC tuner than there would have been with a January 1 cutoff. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment on turning over the bandwidth occupied by analog television channels 5 and 6 (76‚Äì88 MHz) to extend the FM broadcast band when the digital television transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed to June 2009). , 28403 This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies corresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76 MHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band. Ultimately, VHF Channels 5 and 6 were retained for digital broadcast television use after the transition, though the FCC had continued researching the possibility of re-allocating the two channels to an expanded FM band. On August 22, 2011, the United States' Federal Communications Commission announced a freeze on all future applications for broadcast stations requesting to use channel 51,FCC Public Notice DA-11-1428A1 : * Rcd PDF * Microsoft Word document * PDF format * Plain Text format to prevent adjacent-channel interference to the A-Block of the 700 MHz band.

Martin announced the agency would test run the transition to digital terrestrial television in Wilmington, North Carolina, beginning September 8, 2008. This test run was to work out problems that might have occurred before the complete transition.

It began in the mid-1990s with the introduction of the Astro satellite television service, now followed by new paid television services in the 2000s, as well as the digitalisation of over-the-air TV which was expected to be complete by the mid-2010s before being shelved. This article discusses various platforms where DTV is applied in Malaysia, including Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) (DVB-S/DVB-S2 for satellite and DVB-T2 for over-the-air) and Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). Following its successful nationwide digital transition on 31 October 2019, the country became the third in Southeast Asia with digital broadcasts after neighbouring Brunei and Singapore.  DTV systems  = Satellite television = The DTV era in Malaysia began with the introduction of direct broadcast pay television service, Astro, in 1996 as part of commercialisation of space. Astro now transmits about 130 local and international TV channels in the MPEG-2 video format through the Ku band utilising the MEASAT satellite system's transponders, according to the DVB-S standard. Astro's transmission is especially susceptible to rain fade, and complaints of interruption during wet weather are not uncommon in Malaysia with a tropical climate. On December 2011, the former prime minister Najib Razak announced that free satellite television, NJOI will be available to customer starting February 2012. =Digital terrestrial TV= Free-to-air In 2005, the Ministry of Information announced their plan to digitalise nationwide free-to-air TV broadcasts led by Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM). Trial broadcasts were undertaken, involving one thousand households in the Klang Valley from September 2006 till February 2007. According to the then-Deputy Minister of Information, Chia Kwang Chye, the trial received \\"very positive\\" feedback, i.e. \\"more than 60 percent said the quality of the signal ranged from good to better. Over 88 percent said the picture quality improved, while 70 percent said the sound quality was better\\". According to Information Minister Datuk Ahmad Shabery Cheek, it was anticipated that RTM would fully complete its digitalisation in 2012 as part of its three-year restructuring process. It was anticipated that each household, once equipped with the necessary equipment (set-top box, iDTV or DHD set) would receive up to 19 channels, seven of which would fall under RTM and the rest for private broadcasters such as TV3, ntv7, 8TV and TV9. Thus far, besides simulcasting TV1 and TV2, RTM is currently airing RTMi, Muzik Aktif and Arena exclusively on the digital TV platform, transmitted at UHF channel 44, modulated at 64QAM, in test forms. RTM was also expected to launch regional channels for each state and/or territory in Malaysia; increasing to 20 television channels. Media Prima has started trials on March 2009. Malaysia and all other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (with the exception of The Philippines, who selected ISDB instead) had selected DVB-T as the final DTV standard, and were expected to switch off analogue broadcasts completely by 2015. In June 2008, participants of the 6th ASEAN Digital Broadcast Meeting from seven Southeast Asian countries (including Malaysia) agreed to finalise the specifications of the DTV set-top box for use within ASEAN, and also set up an ASEAN HD Centre to provide training on HDTV content to broadcasters in the region. Despite a success of RTM's pilot trials, the digital terrestrial television transition faced many problems. These problems stemmed from the lesser enthusiasm of content providers toward the digitisation, with the exception of Les Copaque, and the need to improve the nation's Internet broadband infrastructure. However, after Abdullah Badawi resigned as Prime Minister and succeeded by Najib in 2008, the project by RTM was deferred indefinitely.  Future  Although Telekom Malaysia has been rumoured to be builder for a digital terrestrial television infrastructure, TM wishes to improve the broadband infrastructure to increase Internet readiness for the country, which leads to Unifi. On 8 January 2014, Puncak Semangat was awarded the concession for digital terrestrial television development. The company is obligated to develop the digital terrestrial television infrastructure, which include a digital multimedia hub and a network of high, medium and low-powered digital TV transmitters nationwide that are capable of carrying up to 45 standard-definition or 15 high- definition digital TV channels, for a start. Television and radio services will be offered first while the latter three, connected services (catch-up TV and video on demand), t-commerce (television commerce) and soft services (e-learning applications and SMS voting) will delivered via home broadband networks after the former two. The first roll-out will start on 16 April 2015 (originally expected to be in the third quarter of 2014), using Puncak Semangat's inside-out rollout strategy where the rural areas will have analogue switch-off first followed by suburbans and eventually urban areas in stages, due to the fact that free-to-air television will benefit rural people while people in urban and suburban areas already have pay television such as Astro and HyppTV. The rollout will complete in 2017 and will cover 98% of Malaysia's population with the capacity of up to 80 television channels and between 30 and 40 radio stations. Once the full digital platform has been rolled out, television broadcasts in analogue will be terminated.  Analogue switch-off  Analogue TV broadcasts would have been shut down in stages, due to complete by 2014 as per recommendation from ASEAN. The DTT migration plan was divided into three phases: # Phase I (2007‚Äì2013) #* Analogue TV & DTT co-exist #* Analogue TV shut down in stages #* Vacate other primary services (radar and LMS) # Phase II (2014‚Äì29 September 2019) #* No analogue TV service #* Vacate DTT service using channels 56 and above #* Vacate LMS in band 477 MHz to 478 MHz # Phase III (30 September 2019‚Äì31 October 2019) #* 100% DTT service using channels 5 to 12 and 21 to 54 Television broadcasts in analogue are originally scheduled for 2017, but the transition will be completed after the full-out of the digital platform. As announced by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) in late September, the full digital transition to be completed on 31 October 2019, the date where analog TV broadcast for remaining states Sabah and Sarawak will end. The switch over in West Malaysia are fully completed on 1 October at 12:30 AM (UTC+8), while the final switch over in East Malaysia are completed on 31 October also at 12:30 AM as scheduled. This marks the end of analogue television broadcast in Malaysia with the country also becomes the third country in Southeast Asia after Singapore and Brunei to undergo successful transition to digital television broadcast.  Paid terrestrial television  In 2006, U Television, formerly MiTV, is scheduled to roll out broadcast services in the H.264 video format according to DVB-T, for better picture quality and more efficient frequency bandwidth usage, after having failed in an earlier venture with the IPTV-over-UHF system previously. = Broadband and IPTV = DETV, a new paid television provider owned by REDtone, provides television and video-on-demand services on the IPTV platform, targeting the Chinese audiences in Malaysia. TM launched its IPTV services, branded as Hypp.TV in the fourth quarter of 2009, and has completed its trials with 1,000 selected households in Klang Valley, Penang and Kulim, Kedah. The service began in March 2010. However, due to the service being tied down to their Unifi fiber-to-the-home service, availability remains limited to areas covered by the national fiber rollout. = Mobile television = Mobile television was introduced in Malaysia with video streaming services by mobile telecommunications providers such as Maxis and DiGi, to users of mobile phones with 3G or similar technologies. Maxis TV now offers more than 20 channels to Maxis 3G subscribers who own compatible mobile phones. Yet, Maxis is expected to roll out broadcast mobile TV services based on DVB-H in the near future. U Mobile also provides broadcast mobile TV to users of selected 3G phones, also based on DVB-H. In October 2008, Astro launched Astro Mobile TV which currently provides 18 channels, all of which are mobile versions of existing Astro TV channels, including seven in-house channels. This service is only available to Maxis subscribers with compatible 2.5G or 3G handsets, and does not reprise its role from Maxis TV cable television. In 2012, HyppTV launched the HyppTV Everywhere service to counter the lack of fiber coverage. Initially only available to Unifi subscribers, the service was opened up to the public to compensate for the limited Unifi coverage.  HDTV  RTM initiated its inaugural high-definition television (HDTV) trials in 2008, with the Beijing Olympic Games, of which RTM test-broadcast the opening and closing ceremony, and several events on HD. In late 2009, Astro launched Astro B.yond as a personal video recorder and a high-definition television service. As of July 2013, Media Prima group chief financial officer Mohamad Ariff Ibrahim told that Media Prima will launch high definition (HD) simulcast for one of its four terrestrial television stations as early as the first half of year 2014. But, audiences are still suffered with SD resolution and stretched 4:3 scale format in most 16:9 TV that majority people own nowadays. Media Prima only start to broadcast selected programmes at 16:9 SD starting from 31 December 2016, however the idents, programme previews, adverts, 4:3 contents and some widescreen programmes remain on 4:3 and improperly stretched (sometimes letterboxed). In early 2015, NJOI began the HD service that will automatically available for free for all NJOI customers starting from 1 February.

The Philippines uses the American NTSC standard for analog television since color television arrived in November 1966. The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) announced in June 2010 that the Philippines would use the Japanese ISDB-T standard for digital terrestrial television (DTT) service, and issued a circular stating that the country's broadcasters must discontinue their analog services by the transition deadline of 11:59 p.m. (Philippine Standard Time, UTC+8) on December 31, 2015; but due to continuous delay of the release of the implementing rules and regulations for DTT broadcast, the target date was moved to 2023. The commission will be using the ultra-high frequency television channels from 14 to 51 (470-698 MHz) for the establishment of a DTT service and liberating channels 14 to 20 (470-512 MHz) which is being used for fixed and mobile services. However, before the announcement, several broadcasters performed trial broadcasts using the European DVB-T standard. Preparation for the transition to DTT started with an issuance of Executive Order 546, series of 1979 and Republic Act 3846 or the Radio Control Law as amended by the local governing body for broadcast services, the NTC adopted the said order to promulgate rules and regulations in order to facilitate the entry of digital broadcast services in the Philippines and implement a specific standard for the delivery of DTT services. Subsequently organizing two technical working groups for the purpose of directing the governing body in the selection of appropriate DTT standard and upon the commendation of investors in the broadcast business, comprising the local broadcasters group, the Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines, and the NTC, issued Memorandum Circular June 2, 2010 on June 11, 2010, implementing the standard for digital terrestrial television. Implementation Digital terrestrial television broadcasting systems by country. While the NTC has selected ISDB-T as its DTV standard, it is evaluating DVB-T2 as an alternate option Since the early 2000s, studies have been carried out on the country's digital television transition. A \\"wait and see\\" plan is being trailed and examining progresses with no resolution to ensue with digital television services in the Philippines. The NTC chose to use the Japanese standard ISDB-T for digital television in the country in Memorandum Circular June 2, 2010, noting its capability to 3 levels of categorized modulation (audio, video and data services) to fixed, portable and handheld devices exclusive of the necessity for a supplementary communication facility.Business Insight Malaya  Business In the draft version of the NTC's proposed regulations for DTV, broadcast companies who intend to provide digital terrestrial television service must have a congressional broadcast franchise before operating such services and have at least 15 television stations throughout the Philippines; have a minimum paid-up capital of ‚Ç±1 billion and accessible locally in 10 regions while broadcasting companies with less than the required television stations and availability locally, the minimum paid-up capital will be ‚Ç±1.2 billion, whereas new applicants with no present broadcast station, the paid-up capital will be ‚Ç±1.5 billion. For those broadcast companies who intend to deliver digital broadcast locally, must procure a congressional franchise and have at least ‚Ç±60 million per digital terrestrial television station. Concurring to the commission, the outline of digital technology in the broadcasting service would guarantee the effectiveness of the broadcast business and provide them the prospect to offer superior facilities to end-user. The draft outline as an enactment of the digital technology in the television broadcast is intended to provide greater number of channels, better screen resolution and stereo sounds through a conventional aerial antenna instead of a satellite or cable TV service. Initially, the commission adopted the European standard DVB-T for digital broadcasting. The broadcast providers adopt either high-definition television format or its standard definition multiprogramming. The draft IRR also states that a duly broadcast provider with a congressional franchise will deliver analog television service and must carry its present analog television programs through its digital terrestrial television service. For digital broadcast provider aiming to offer pay-per-view or restricted access will be required to seek additional permission from the commission. Supplementary services may be permissible, subject to prevailing decrees, acts and laws. The draft rules equally specify the commission shall continue to process new applications for analog television stations up to December 31, 2008 but will no longer approve or authorized to broadcast beyond December 31, 2010 and all certified digital broadcast providers will relinquish their individual analog frequencies upon the termination of its analog television broadcast transmission by 11:59 p.m., December 31, 2015. However, since the last quarter of 2014, the digitization deadline has been postponed to 2019 and should be expected that all analog broadcasts will be shut off in 2023. Deployment =Terrestrial= *ABS-CBN: ABS-CBN Corporation intends to spend 1 billion pesos on its transition to digital broadcasting. ABS-CBN announced on April 4, 2011 that it was prepared to launch five free \\"premium\\" channels on a DTT platform as soon as the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) finalize its regulations on digital television. ABS-CBN uses UHF channel 43 (647.143 MHz) for its ISDB-T test (also eventually move on UHF channel 14 (473.143 MHz) in order to be the first to scan) for its ISDB-T test, and previously used channel 51 (695.143 MHz) for test broadcasts using DVB-T. Their initial test was conducted in areas of Valenzuela, Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite and Laguna. In November 2010, ABS-CBN began rolling out its digital broadcast in 17 cities in Metropolitan Manila including selected areas in Bulacan and Pampanga.ABS-CBN unit to roll out digital TV-based teaching On February 11, 2015, ABS-CBN launched the ABS-CBN TV Plus, a digital TV service becoming the first TV network in the country to commercially launch DTT. It also operates exclusive DTT channels (channels that other topbox devices cannot receive) and as well has an HD transmission of their flagship Channel 2. However in 2020, the NTC and Solicitor General Jose Calida issued a total of three cease-and-desist orders against ABS-CBN Corporation (including UHF Channel 43 and all digital channels of ABS-CBN TV Plus) to stop broadcasting due to an expired franchise. *PTV: The state broadcaster People's Television Network, Inc. began DTT trials using ISDB-T in 2009 used channel 48 (677.143 MHz). In 2011, the Japanese government donated additional equipment to the network in order to improve its digital services. PTV 4 is also planning to operate an Emergency Warning Broadcast system (EWBS) using the digital platform. PTV currently uses channel 42 (641.143 MHz). *5: TV5 Network, Inc. (formerly known as ABC Development Corporation/Associated Broadcasting Company) uses ISDB-T for its DTT trials; a simulcast of DWET-TV through DWDZ-TV. TV5 was broadcast on two Digital TV Channels as part of their Digital TV Test Broadcast; these are Channel 42 (641.143 MHz) from Nation Broadcasting Corporation and Channel 51 (695.143 MHz) from GV Broadcasting Corporation. Currently, 5 (and its sister station, One Sports) is broadcasting on Channel 51 (695.143 MHz) eventually to move on Channel 18 (497.143 MHz). *GMA: GMA Network, Inc. applied for a digital television license from the NTC to install and maintain transmitting stations that will be attuned with and utilize to offer digital terrestrial television and digital mobile TV broadcast services,http://www.gmanetwork.com/article/1/GMA-Network-earmarks-P200M-to- test-digital-TV using channel 27. Areas planned for a temporary digital broadcast will cover the cities of Quezon City, Makati, Pasig, Tagaytay, and Angeles in Pampanga; and areas like Ortigas, Cavite, and Calumpit in Bulacan. GMA was vocal about the NTC's choice of DTV standard; on March 27, 2011, a GMA executive proposed the use of the updated European standard DVB-T2 as opposed to ISDB-T due to its better quality. However, the NTC did not change its decision.http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20110327-327965 However, after few years they are ready to adopt the ISDB-T standardhttp://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/361984/economy/companies/gma- network-is-ready-for-digital-broadcasting-gma-s-gozon Currently, they are broadcasting on Digital UHF Channel 15 (479.143 MHz) on ISDB-T.

Solar also operates free-to-air and exclusive DTT channels. On the first quarter of 2018, Solar launched its own digital setup-box called Easy TV, until it ceased on September 30, 2019. *SMNI: Sonshine Media Network International is conducting a DTT testing using ISDB-T on UHF Channel 40 (629.143 MHz). *Hope Channel Philippines and GNN: Gateway UHF Broadcasting and First United Broadcasting Corporation is conducting a DTT testing using ISDB-T on UHF Channel 45 (659.143 MHz). *CNN Philippines: On January 28, 2016, Radio Philippines Network and Nine Media Corporation is conducting a DTT testing using ISDB-T on UHF Channel 19 (503.143 MHz). *Light Network: On March 1, 2017, ZOE Broadcasting Network made history on Philippine TV broadcasting as it switched to digital-only broadcasting, using DZOZ-TV Channel 33 (587.143 MHz). Light Network is the first TV network in the country to fully abandon its analog transmissions and shift to digital television, as network engineers stated that they have been prepared for years to make the switch happen. *IBC: In October 2017, despite its impending privatization, the state-sequestered Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation managed to conduct DTT testing using ISDB-T on UHF Channel 26 (545.143 MHz). *DZRH Television: Manila Broadcasting Company, the largest radio network in the Philippines, has started conducting its DTT broadcast in Cebu City using UHF channel 43 (647.143 MHz). *UNTV: Progressive Broadcasting Corporation, owned and operated by Breakthrough and Milestones Productions International is currently testing its ISDB-T on UHF Channel 38 (617.143 MHz), and it can be viewed in Mega Manila, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Cavite and other nearby provinces. *RJTV: On January 4, 2019, Rajah Broadcasting Network started its broadcasting on digital using UHF Channel 29 (563.143 MHz).

Television firms who plan to broadcast digital terrestrial television services to television and other communication devices cannot implement such as the commission is revising its guidelines on digital television programming. However, the commission allows broadcast firms to test its system while waiting for the implementing rules and regulations (IRR). The development comes in light with telecom company, Smart Communications Inc. through its MediaQuest Holdings, Inc. for its myTV service. The commission reiterates in the absence of IRR, the telecom company cannot charge the service being offered to its subscribers. *June 2009. In formulating the transition from analog television broadcast to digital terrestrial television (DTT) transmission in the Philippines and to guide the commission in outlining the planned implementing rules and regulations for the enactment of DTT service, ultra-high frequency television channels 14 to 51 (470-698 MHz) will be assigned to the DTT Broadcast Service and deliberating further channels 14 to 20 (470-512 MHz) which is being used by Fixed and Mobile Service. On June 24, 2009, the local unit of the commission, the Frequency Management Division is assigned to formulate a frequency allocation plan for the effective transmission of appropriate users of channels 14 to 20. *February 2010. The Philippines is anticipated to deferment its planned analog television signal automatic switch-off in 2015 due to technicalities in implementing an official digital terrestrial television platform. While other members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations cooperatively accepted the digital video broadcasting- terrestrial or the DVB-T as its favored standard, the Philippines have not adopted any platform. *December 2010. The governments of Japan and the Philippines reached a collaboration decision in adopting a memorandum of cooperation resulting in the commission‚Äôs earlier pronouncement to use the Japanese‚Äôs Integrated Services Digital Broadcast-Terrestrial platform for digital terrestrial television broadcast standard for the Philippines. According to the Commission on Information and Communications Technology, the Japanese government is keen on guiding Filipino counterpart to the technology. The Philippine government also requested its counterpart to shoulder the cost of set-top boxes and also deliberating in rescheduling the compulsory switchover from analog transmission to digital broadcast from an earlier target. *February 2011. The NTC plans to implement the digital terrestrial television service in select key cities in the Philippines in 2012. The governing body desires the transition be implemented gradually. The technical working group has yet not classified where the transition will take place. Key cities in the Philippines are being considered but in the absence of an implementing rules and regulations, the digital terrestrial television service may not be fully consummate to the viewing public. While the transition will be made progressively, broadcasting networks can still convey analog television service although DTT is being rationalized in other areas. Meanwhile, the commission set an 85 percent compliance rate before it consider terminating all analog signals for broadcast transmission.http://businessmirror.com.ph/home/companies/7898-ntc-wants- digital-tv-service-launched-in-key-cities-by-2012 *March 2011. The NTC asked to reevaluate the platform to be used for the Philippines digital television broadcast. The regulator is studying the possible implementation of a newer platform, the European second-generation Digital Video Broadcasting- Terrestrial (DVB-T2) substituting the Japanese Integrated Services Digital Broadcast-Terrestrial (ISDB-T) standard that the commission adopted earlier and was the basis of creating implementing rules and regulations for digital broadcast. Experts announced the DVB-T2 is superior to its Japanese counterpart. Broadcasting firms, GMA Network, Inc. conveyed their support to reevaluate its earlier decision to adopt ISDB-T platform. The Commission adopted the ISDB-T primarily owing in terms of affordability. *April 2011. One of Philippines broadcasting firms, ABS-CBN Corporation, criticized the NTC for conveying varied indications on the Philippines official stand on digital television standard. The firm panned the commission on its incompetence in supporting its initial pronouncement to implement Japanese digital television standard, the Integrated Services Digital Broadcast-Terrestrial (ISDB-T). In 2010, the commission officially led the digital television period in the Philippines and releases a memorandum circular agreeing to the use of ISDB-T as the standard digital platform. But in recent developments, the commission is considering the European digital television platform, the European Digital Video Broadcast-Terrestrial (DVB-T). According to the commission, the European platform is superior to its Japanese counterpart. *May 2011. Television companies in the Philippines have supported the local governing body to reevaluate the digital television standard to be used, and the attempt to reconsider the advancement of the Japanese technology (ISDB-T) over the newer version of the European digital television platform. Broadcasting companies initiated to delay the switchover provided the technology will be used is far more advanced than the initial digital standard adopted on June 11, 2010. TV5 agreed to do comparative tests with the European and Japanese standard. The commission is simultaneously drafting the implementing rules and regulations for digital terrestrial television broadcast under the Japanese platform and reviewing the DVB-T2 European standard.http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideBusiness.htm?f=2011/may/19/business1.isx&d;=2011/may/19 *August 2011. The NTC finalized its evaluation on the chosen standard for the digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcast service in the Philippines. The commission adopted the Japan‚Äôs Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting- Television (ISDB-T) standards over its European counterpart, the Digital Video Broadcasting-Television (DVB-T2). *October 2013. The NTC reconfirmed the recommendation to adopt the Japanese Digital Television standard as the country's national TV standard after a public hearing. *December 17, 2014. NTC released the draft implementing rules and regulations for the Philippines' transition to digital television. *March 2016. The NTC holds public consultations regarding the migration plan to digital television. It envisions the Philippines to go \\"fully migrated to digital TV\\" in three to five years (2019-2021). *February 2017. The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) officially start the switch-over from Analog to Digital. DICT also moves the schedule for total shut-off of analog TV services to the year 2023. *February 2018. NTC released the implementing rules and regulations on the re-allocation of the UHF Channels 14-20 (470‚Äì512 Megahertz (MHz) band) for digital terrestrial television broadcasting (DTTB) service. All operating and duly authorized Mega Manila VHF (very high frequency) television networks are entitled to a channel assignment from Channels 14 to 20.

The other ones are Tettnang Old Palace (opposite to the New Palace) and Torschloss close to B√§renplatz. Tettnang Castle is owned by Staatliche Schl√∂sser und G√§rten Baden-W√ºrttemberg. History Originally, a fort stood on the site of the current castle. From 1260 until 1780, the site was the residence of the Counts of Montfort. The old fort was destroyed in 1633, during the Thirty Years' War. Count Anton III of Montfort subsequently started rebuilding the castle in 1712, hiring the architect Christoph Gessinger, a Benedictine friar from Isny, to draft designs for a new castle. His aim was to tear down the remains of the mediaeval fort to make way for a completely new palace. In 1728, construction work came to a grinding halt when the funds of the Count ran dry. Count Anton III died in 1733, and the castle remained unfinished. A major section of the fa√ßade, along with parts of the interior decoration, were damaged by fire in 1753. Under the patronage of Count Franz Xaver, restoration work was subsequently completed in 1770. The fine sculptures and paintwork inside the castle were carried out by Joseph Anton Feuchtmayer, K√§te Schaller-H√§rlin and Andreas Brugger. Jakob Emele was responsible for the rococo work. When the county of Tettnang was sold to Austria around 1780 (to pay off debts), most of the interior fittings were sold and the castle passed into public ownership. When Tettnang was handed over to Bavaria as part of the Peace of Pressburg, the castle returned to German ownership. Additional restoration of the castle was carried out between 1960 and 1982. In 1997, the castle was opened to the public for tours. Since 2015 the Museum is open 6 days a week, except Wednesday, each from Easter until October 31. The Museum can be visited during guided tours only, which are starting hourly. Taking photos during the tours is prohibited. In 2014 the first Schlossgarten Open-Air was held in the garden next to the Castle, the next concerts are in June 2017.

The church Is in the Diocese of Ely and follows the 'Anglo-Catholic' or 'high-church' tradition of the Church of England. In addition to its main Sunday Mass, the church has a strong tradition of daily morning and evening prayer, regular weekday Communion and the keeping of church festivals. The church has a particular ministry helping men and women to explore possible vocations to the priesthood. Little St Mary's has active overseas mission links, provides support to local mental health projects, and participates in Hope Cambridge's Churches Homeless Project. At present, the vicar is The Rev. Dr Robert Mackley. History Godfrey Washington's monument There has been a place of worship on the current site since around the twelfth century. The earliest known records of the church state that the first church here was called St Peter-without- Trumpington Gate, to distinguish it from St Peter by the Castle (or ad castrum). It was controlled by three successive generations of the same family until 1207. After that date it was given to the Hospital of St John the Evangelist and served by chaplains from that foundation. In the early 1280s, Hugh de Balsham, Bishop of Ely, lodged some scholars in the Hospital but to his dismay found soon that the sick and the students could not live in harmony together. The students were moved in 1284 to the site of what is now Peterhouse; this was the origin of the first Cambridge college. By the 1340s the church was in such a bad state that the fellows of Peterhouse decided to rebuild it. In 1352, the new building had the dual purpose of College Chapel (to Peterhouse) and Parish Church. At this time, it was rededicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1632 Peterhouse built a separate Chapel and St Mary the Less reverted to being a Parish Church. Richard Crashaw, the metaphysical poet, was a priest there from 1638 to 1643, at the same time that he was a Fellow of Peterhouse. In 1643, after his departure, many of the Church's ornaments and statues were damaged or destroyed by the Puritan iconoclast William Dowsing. The damage to the sedilia and the archway leading to the present-day Lady Chapel has never been repaired. In 1741 the church was refitted with wooden panelling, box pews, choir gallery, and the present pulpit. From 1856‚Äì7 Sir George Gilbert Scott restored the church and removed the 18th-century panelling. Further restoration work was carried out in 1876 and 1891, but by 1880 the church was much as it is now. The south, or Lady Chapel, was added in 1931 and designed by T. H. Lyon, the architect of Sidney Sussex College Chapel. The Parish Centre at the west end of the church was built in 1892 and enlarged in 1990 and again in 2011. Reverend Godfrey Washington (the great uncle of US President George Washington), who died on 28 September 1729, is buried in Little St Mary's. His memorial is on the north wall close to the main door. The coat of arms of the Washington family, a black eagle atop a shield of red stars and stripes, adorns the tablet. It is from this coat of arms that the 'Stars and Stripes' of the U.S. National Flag, and the U.S. black eagle emblem, may derive.
